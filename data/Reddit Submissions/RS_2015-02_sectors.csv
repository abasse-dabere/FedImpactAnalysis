personalfinance,Just got my W-2...help with state tax mix-up,"Background: I moved to DC for my first job out of college last year. When I filled out paperwork I didn't have a place to live yet, so I listed my parent's address. I found a place to live and thought I had gone through all of the steps to change my address, and (this is the part where I'm exceptionally stupid) didn't check my paystubs beyond the ""how much money did I get?"" part.  
  

A few months into the year I noticed that they had *not* changed my address, and had been withholding state tax for the state my parents live in. I went and immediately got it changed to DC. Payroll suggested withholding some additional DC tax for the rest of the year so I don't get shocked by a huge tax bill, so I did. From then on, my paystubs (which I started checking carefully) listed ""DC Wages"" with the full YTD amount I'd earned and ""Other State Wages"" as 0.  
  
I just got two W-2s:  
  
  -One with my full federal wages and DC wages (but only the amount I had earned after realizing my mistake and getting my state changed)  
  
and  
  
-One with no federal wages and my parents' state wages (the amount I earned before I realized my mistake)
  
  
**My questions**:   
  
-Do I need to go get a new W-2 with the full amount I earned as DC wages?  
 
-How the bleep do I file this?",finance,1422757132

personalfinance,I think I was scammed by the EVERYONEON partner Basic-Internet or at least a victim of false advertising.,I have had zero income since Aug 2014 and I only grossed $3650 for 2014($3231.83 after taxes)working a road construction job. I thought if I had internet that it would be a valuable resource for earning more money since I spent most of my savings on groceries.So when I searched for a low income ISP I found out about the EVERYONEON program and its partner Basic-Internet that resale government subsidized T-Mobile data plans. You only need to live in a low income zipcode to qualify. So I enrolled in the 1gb 4G with unlimited 3G plan.I had to buy the mobile hotspot for $41.23 after tax plus the $10 a month fee and $20 FedEx shipping for a total of $71.23.I used up the 1gb 4G of data so I could see how well the unlimited 3G worked before I was stuck with the hardware.It doesn't work as advertised since they throttle the connection to 128kbs after the 1gb of 4G data is used up.Simple web pages with text and photos can take minutes to load but a lot of the time they just timeout.I have no options other than 56k dialup internet in my area but you need a landline for that.There are no DSL or CABLE providers in my area neither. Maybe I can help somebody like myself from spending their last $100 on something that is falsely advertised.If I am able to return the hotspot I will stll be out $30 for shipping and flat rate monthly fee.I think maybe these EVERYONEON partners like Basic-Internet could be exploiting the poor and scamming them out of their last pennies.

personalfinance,Got married in October but now I have to pay back my ACA credit for the whole year from my taxes?,"I was just filing my taxes via the H&amp;R Block website. My husband and I got married in October and we decided to file jointly. While filing, you can see your estimated return and it was at around $2800 for federal. After entering in my ACA info, it says that my return dropped to around $1400 because I have to pay back my $1400 tax credit that I received for my health insurance through the ACA. 

My husband and I were married in October but I got my health insurance back in April of 2014. I now have insurance through my new job as of early January. The site is saying I have to pay back the credits because I misreported and we make too much money for me to have gotten the insurance credit in the first place. But, at the time, I was making ~$16k a year as a waitress and not married.

Should we file separately for this year instead? Will that even make a difference with the ACA? Will we miss out on large tax credits for filing jointly as a married couple?

Thanks guys!",finance,1422762918
personalfinance,Advice for independent college student that might need to apply for student loans?,"Hi PF!

TL;DR: How to pay for college by myself? How do I build my credit to get approved for a student loan by myself?

Sorry this is going to be a little long:

I'm a 21 year old full-time undergrad student. I also work full time (approx $13/hr) while being a full time student. I haven't exactly been 100% smart with my finance decisions. 

For example, last year, I got in a car accident; my car was sent to the junk yard for scraps. Living in the Minnesota where the road conditions aren't always perfect, I was looking for a reliable car. At that moment I justified my decision on buying a used 2012 Yaris for about $12k plus other fees.

I pay for everything myself: tuition, books, rent, gas, food, auto loan payment, insurance, etc etc.. I have been making a lot of effort to pay everything on time, and save money when I can as much as possible.
I don't get any financial help from my family or anyone else. My family lives in SoCal, and only have one income from one parent, which is not very much at all. They have to support my siblings and on top of that, the one of my siblings is in college, too (supported by my family).

I've managed to pay for everything out of pocket so far, but doing the math, it looks like I won't have enough to pay out of pocket from next semester going forward. I've been using my bank credit card for ALL my purchases and paying the balance in full on time to build my credit. I'm trying to graduate by summer of 2016, and the total amount that I will need to borrow (on top of federal loans and financial aid) is $6-10k. I don't have anyone that can cosign for me. 

What else can I do to make sure that I can get approved for this amount in student loans? Which financial institutions do you recommend for student loans? I could use any advice I can get!!",finance,1422763025

personalfinance,Amortization schedule and bank mortgage payments are not the same.,"I have just made my first payment on our 15 yr fixed mortgage.  The PI amount is $1393.22  In MS Money and Excel I calculate the first payment Principal to be $878.39 and the Interest to be $520.83.  Upon reviewing my bank statement today, I see that they are applying $654.04 and $748.18 to P&amp;I respectively.  I don't understand the difference.  Before I go yelling at the bank on Monday, can anyone provide a reason why?  

A few details:
Loan Amount: $200,000.00
Interest Rate: 3.125%
Term: 15 yrs Fixed simple interest
First Payment: 2/1/15

We converted from a construction loan on 12/10/14.  We had payed ahead interest at closing to first payment date so I do not think this is the case. 

The difference is quite large and I cannot in any way to get the math to support the terms of the loans and this distribution of P&amp;I.",finance,1422788612

personalfinance,Where can I get Local Taxes Done?,"I got my Federal/State taxes done just yesterday at a tax preparer place, and was disappointed to learn that they didn't do local taxes there. One of the reasons I ventured there this year was because 2014 was a fun year for me, especially considering local taxes:

* Lost old job
* Got contracted job (no taxes taken out -- I have the 1099)
* Got fulltime job, where my official workplace was home
  * Taxes were taken out locally, but technically I live in a township with no tax rate
* Fulltime job opened office in another city
  * Local tax shifted correctly to said city

This leads to my W2 for the new fulltime job having two lines in the ""local"" boxes (one for where I live/worked, one for where I work now). The tax place I went to said there'd be a local place to ""get my taxes prepared for me"" for local, but chatting with my landlord (since I've no idea where I'd go for that) there doesn't seem to be such a place.

What are my options? I think I'm owed back the tax paid into my residential area, and the contracted period was also Work From Home so no worries there, but I don't know where to start. The whole point of going to a tax place was so I didn't have to worry about it, but it's apparently the norm for these places to not do city/local tax stuff for you?",finance,1422793342

personalfinance,"Climbed out of debt and poverty, but now I'm either too scared to spend, or spending on crap I don't need","Here's my backstory: I grew up poor, and I was working as early as 14, getting a part-time job at KFC while going to school. After I graduated from high school, I went to college but flunked out because I was lazy and did not have the discipline to study hard. From this point on, my path was littered with a slew of various minimum wage jobs in retail and food &amp; beverage. Since I was barely making enough to survive, I used credit cards to buy the shit I didn't need, like new clothes, shoes, make-up, etc. It was so crazy; I was buying and buying all this stuff, not using it, then buying some more just to make myself happy and forget the very real possibility that I might be stuck at minimum wage for the rest of my life.

Finally, in 2009, I went into therapy for depression and got medicated. Suddenly I could see things clearly. I was digging myself into a hole. I had around 20K of CC debt and personal loans, and I had to pay it off if I ever wanted a future.

So for the next five years, I dug my heels in and really worked at it. I got a second job, I lived a life of austerity and barely spent on anything. After I put aside money for rent, food and transport, almost everything else went to my debt. My mom pitied me, came in and paid off all my cards with most of her savings, then told me to pay her what I could every month, interest-free, so that I could get back on my feet.

Since I no longer had to deal with horrendous interest rates, I slowly started taking online classes to get my degree. Finally, in 2014, I finished paying my mom back AND I graduated. Last month, I got promoted at my job to a better-paying position due to my new degree.

Usually, on payday, I would pay all my bills immediately, pay my mom and sock aside money for my tuition. Then I would be left with about $300 for food and transport. I was so very used to not having any extra to play with. However, January 2015 was the first month in years where my salary didn't automatically disappear to pay other people. I had more than an extra thousand sitting in my account even after paying all my bills. I knew I should put it immediately towards an emergency fund.

However, thanks to living like a monk (nun?) for the last 4 or 5 years, there are many things that need replacing. I need new bedsheets, I've had one set that I've been washing repeatedly and they now have holes in them. I need a new pillow, my old one is 5 years old and falling apart and giving me neckaches. I need new shoes, the ones I wear to work everyday are peeling at the sides and the women at work make snide remarks. 

While I know I need to replace some things, part of me is terrified to spend again because I'm worried my addictive spending tendencies will spring up and drag me down into debt hell again. I keep stressing out over what I really *need* to buy and what I *want* to buy. Unfortunately, when I get too stressed, I stupidly start to spend on the 'want' things. So I've been buying make-up, skincare stuff...it's scary and I don't want a repeat of where I was five years ago.

I need to repair my relationship with money and I'm prepared to take out all my extra money and hand it over to my mom for her to keep so that I stop spending it. I've tried putting the money in a separate account, it doesn't work since I subconsciously know about it. 

Since I lived well for five years with the same bedsheets and pillow and shoes, can I go on living in such an austere way until everything breaks down and I have no choice but to get new ones? I don't want to give myself an excuse to spend frivolously again, but at the same time, I don't want to be like one of those people on Extreme Cheapskates.",finance,1422799747

nuclear,I'm reposting a comment I just made about the safety of nuclear power because I want to share this,"The list of serious nuclear accidents is longer than Chernobyl and Fukushima. Three Mile Island. Windscale (Britain). The Asse salt mine (Germany). Mayak (Russia). Hanford (Washington state). Tokai (Japan).

The list of near serious accidents is much longer. Accident by accident, the world becomes increasingly irradiated. I live in France which increases my chance of getting cancers (not much I know) relative to my native New Zealand because of Chernobyl. Eastern Honshu in Japan is now badly irradiated, as is increasingly the northern Pacific. Thanks to Hanford a large part of Washington state and the Columbia river need to be added to this list, as does a big area around the southern Urals and western Siberia (Mayak).

There are two reasons why the nuclear industry is protected from negative publicity. The first is because, like many industries, it is inhabited by vested interests with deep pockets, and this creates a very powerful nuclear lobby across the globe. The second is because the nuclear industry is traditionally tied to government strategy since it has fed nuclear research and plutonium production. EDF is in effect an arm of the French state.

The industry is protected by the government because to a varying extent everywhere the industry is government. Who pays the insurance bill for nuclear power plants? No one, because they are de facto insured by their governments (or far more accurately the people). This is not a private industry. It's the most exciting and the most dangerous gravy train in human history.",energy,1422806402

personalfinance,$3k Tax Refund - Apply to CC Debt or Student Loan Debt?,"We're projected to receive a $3k refund on our taxes this year.

My wife and I recently completed our graduate educations and would like to begin aggressively paying down our student loans ($80k between us at 3.31% (private) 5.41% or 6.41% (both federal)).

We also have a credit card in my name whose balance is roughly $6,000 at 10.99%. We've had to incur CC debt due to poor planning and failure to budget in the past.

Following the Avalanche method the higher IR debt (CC) would be the first target. My concern is that in the event of an emergency CC debt theoretically could go back up. However, we're building up our savings to reduce the possibility of needing to use the CC.

Whereas we will not be taking out any additional student loans thus the UPB will not be added to (aside from interest capitalization).

personalfinance,"complex situation, I need your help r/personalfinance","okay let me get some facts out there. I have been blessed with a good situation to have, but its a bit complicated. bear with me.

I am 28 years old. I am in physical therapy school, and i graduate in may of 2016, at which point i will start making a decent salary, most likely with 401k benefits.

The bad news:

Current student Debt - 90k (about 22k of which is currently at 6.8% or 7.2%...fucking grad school loans!)

tuition and fees yet to be charge for summer 2015, fall 2015, and spring 2016 - 24k

estimated living expenses (including housing, utilities, transportation, food, cell phone, entertainment, etc) from now until june 2016 when i start working - 25k

The Good News:

Current checking account balance - 58k

i received a 50k life insurance payment from my father, who recently passed.

the remainder of that life insurance money, plus the money from the sale of his house, will be in a sub-trust and will be distributed to me in 5 years - total current value - 62k (this will be invested inside the trust for 5 years)

the best news:

I also inherited a 250k beneficiary stretch IRA, that i will be able to take the required minimum distribution (RMD) based on my insurance lifetime. It will be only a fraction at first, but continue to grow. Also, the money in that IRA will continue to grow tax free! what a blessing! However, I may choose to take a larger distribution this first year, because my income will be basically zero and it might be worthwhile to take a lower tax hit with a small portion (10-20k???) this year.

My question to r/personal finance...

What the hell do i do? haha. 

I just opened a roth IRA with last year's income, 2014, sadly only 1500 dollars. So that account is open, at least.

I see several scenarios.

scenario 1: 

for 2015, i take an RMD from the beneficiary IRA of roughly 5500 dollars, and plop that straight into my roth.

I use the 58k on hand to pay off the 22k in high interest rate loans, and live off the rest until i graduate. I take student loans to cover the tuition and fees for the next year.

scenario 2:

 for 2015, i take an RMD from the beneficiary IRA of roughly 5500 dollars, and plop that straight into my roth.

I use the 58k on hand to pay off my tuition and fees for the next year in full, and take no loans.

scenario 3: 

for 2015, i take an RMD from the beneficiary IRA of roughly 5500 and plop it straight into my roth.

I live off the 58k on hand, and invest 25k in taxable brokerage accounts, relatively conservatively, and hope my return is more than the interest on my loans.

Question: 

can i take some of 58k on hand and open a regular IRA as well? can i fully fund the IRA from last year (2014) with $5500 dollars, (my father died november of 2014, and i received the life insurance money december 2014) or can i only contribute the amount that i earned in wages? 

What do i do? there are a lot of different scenarios and i just want to make sure i am making the right decision.

My friend has nearly $200k in student loans, almost all private. Many with 12% interest.

She lives in downtown Boston with $1,300/month rent. She's going into personal training full time, which is probably not a six-figure career path (that's the only salary I can think of to justify $170k in loans - and even then, not really). She keeps taking out more loans to pay for certifications that she says will make her more marketable when she graduates this Spring.

Her latest decision is to move to San Francisco next year, since there are bigger opportunities in the health &amp; wellness field there. Her goal is to land a job with Google as an on-site trainer making $80k/year. I have no idea if this is the norm, as I don't know much about San Fran or the wellness field in general. She wants to live in a SF studio at around $2,700/month.

Since she's young, she needs a cosigner, and her parents are very poor. So she has asked me to cosign, and I want to be there to help make her dreams come true. But this is a lot of debt (which she calls ""not even $200k""), and I don't know if her goals are totally realistic. I want to support her as a friend 100%, I just don't think this is a smart idea.

Beyond the cosigning dilemma, I'm really worried about her financial situation in general. I'm afraid she doesn't understand the long-term ramifications of this kind of debt. I don't know how to share these concerns with her without jeopardizing my place as a trusted friend. I've gently tried to help along the way, like convincing her she doesn't need an iPhone with monthly data plan, or explaining that $80k salary will not equate to taking home $80k per year (especially in SF where local + federal taxes would be around 30%) 

Any ideas on sitting down and having a more serious discussion, without making her feel like I'm attacking her dream? I just really don't think I can cosign for this.

personalfinance,Please give me advice on if a Quit Claim Deed is a good process or not,"Hello there /r/personalfinance. I've lurked here and I've liked the things people say. They seem to make sense :)

So I am in a situation that I would like to get some perspective and advice on.

I am in a situation that basically means I could get myself a decent townhome for the very good price of ~100K under open market. My parents own a house that is currently a rental. They are willing to Quit Claim Deed it to me as long as I take over the loan and pay them their equity in the house and it will become my primary home. Equity is ~50K. Per the terms/conditions on the loan, I can assume it. The loan is currently an ARM for ~170K with an interest rate in the order of around 1.8% or thereabouts. The last ARM cycle had them NOT change the interest rate so it stays there for the next year. So that helps. Also, if the rate were to go up it would only go up a maximum of 1% per year so in theory if it would still go up that much then I'd still be ok....but I still plan on getting a fixed in a refinance fairly quickly thereafter.

SO my questions are this.

Are there any gotchas I need to worry about with the Quit Claim Deed process? Per what I understand, as long as everything is current (property taxes, no outstanding fines/liens and whatnot) then in theory the process should be able to go forward and everything should be good and ownership transfer should be clean cut. However, I'm not a real estate attorney/tax attorney. Hence, I want to ask here.

Secondly, for the loan I plan on taking and having full responsibility. I do not want co-signage and/or anything else. So then in theory that would mean my parents' finances and my finances would be completely separate?

I may not have provided enough info, and if I haven't please let me know. 

Thanks much",finance,1422816337
personalfinance,"Help with student loans, bad credit, and saving options (21 years old in NY)","I went to CC for a year. I applied to a 4 year school. I then took out two student loans to go to a 4 year school. After the first semester, they notified me that I still owed ~$3,000 that the loans didn't cover. I had to drop out and work.

I tried going back to CC part time while working. Had to drop out because I couldn't make bills unless I was working full&amp;overtime. I owe that school ~$800.

I also took out a credit card at 18, maxed it, then threw away the card and promptly forgot about it until I checked my credit report out of curiously.





I'm now looking at the following debt:


Student loan #1 unsubsidized, $4000.

Student loan #2 subsidized, $3750

Credit card debt that went to collections, $500

Bill owed to 4 year school, $3000

Bill owed to CC, $800



I was able to get payments on my federal student loans deferred until December 2015 without missing a payment. I was informed that I can push for another year at that time, but my total payment deferment period cannot exceed 24months.


How do I go about paying back the other bills (both schools, then collections)?


How would I contact for a payment plan for the schools?

Edit: payment plan for loans currently sit at around $105 a month, but is deferred for now.

How long will I really be paying over time, with interest? What's the difference between the two federal loans?

How do I get the collections off my credit report / build credit up from 572?

personalfinance,Preloan questions,"I got into a tight spot over the past year. I'll forgo the sob story so tl;dr: I took on about $15k in high interest credit card debt. I've made a strict budget, and I'm able to make the monthly payments and I'm slowly chipping away at it. But the interest rates are killing me (18%-25%).

I'm considering a personal loan to secure the debt and have fixed monthly payments at a lower interest rate. Then I can pay the credit cards off and close them. I think my best bet might be going to a credit union, and opening an account with them. But I'm not sure the best way to approach this.

In addition to my emergency fund, I now have about $2000 saved up that I can put towards this debt. My question is, should I put it all towards one of the cards first? Or should I open an account with a credit union with the $2000, and then apply for a loan from them? Will credit unions even allow new members to apply for a loan?

Thanks for reading. This has been a very hard lesson to learn, but I'm doing everything I can to approach this analytical so I can get back on track. Any advice appreciated.",finance,1422819948

personalfinance,Is taking out an unnecessary car loan worth it to build credit in an area with expensive housing?,"I recently graduated and am moving to a new area for work. I need a car, and have enough saved up to buy it without a loan (~$25k) while leaving a reasonably sized emergency fund in savings. I plan on saving up for a down payment on a house, and possibly getting one down the road. Because housing in this area is quite expensive (median is around $400k), it seems that building credit by taking out a loan on the car could perhaps be worth it. 

Is this a good idea?

I've found mixed information on the internet. I suspect it all comes down to the numbers, but I don't know how much of a credit score increase this loan would provide, and I don't know how much that would impact interest rates on a mortgage. So I can't do the math myself.

personalfinance,Can I afford to move out with $40K in debt?,"Hi r/personalfiance, 

Here are my details: 

* $42,060.84 total debt
* 23,972.84 -- subsidized loans (interest rates ranging from 3.4-5.6%)
* 8,000 -- Perkins loan
* 5,588 -- unsubsidized loans (interest rates at 4.66 and 6.8%)
* 4,500 -- bank loan (9.1%)
* 0 credit card debt
* $500 emergency fund


I am currently making about $1K a month. My bills going forward total $458 (cell, private loan, car insurance and paying my parents back) but they have been higher in the past (higher amounts due on loan and to parents), so that is why I have only managed to save $500 despite having this job for almost two years. 

I will be student teaching in the fall so I will be making no money. 

I want to move out for three major reasons: 

1. My brother with autism does not sleep through the night. His bedroom shares a wall with mine. When he gets up in the middle of the night he almost always wakes me up. I cannot be a good teacher if I cannot sleep through the night. 
2. My parents are very stressed financially and emotionally because of all the problems with my brother, and that stress often filters to me. I would like to decrease my stress levels as much as possible in the ways I can. Neither one of them is working. 
3. I need more space -- so I can spread out and grade papers, so I can cook healthy meals for myself, so I can have people over if I want instead of constantly going out, etc. 

I will definitely be taking out more loans (hopefully Federal PLUS, as I turn 24 and qualify in May) for summer and fall tuition. I also might need to take out loans for just my current living expenses (listed above) if I cannot save up enough before student teaching starts -- so total, that would be an estimated $7,000 more in loans (high estimate; living expenses at $3500 and tuition at $3500), BEFORE money for rent and food. Is it really a terrible decision?


I'm estimating rent and food for a semester at $4,500. So the loan I would be taking out to live on would be for June-December, and then hopefully starting in January of next year I will have a full time teaching job.

Liveaboarding on a sailboat seems to be the best solution. I needn't advice on the costs of moorage, or maintenance as I have already figured all that out. 

I was originally going to buy anything that floats using the 6000$ or so that I have at the ready, but I've noticed some exceptional deals on boats between $12 000 - $17 000 that I believe will provide a much better living experience and hold their value reasonably well.

My credit score is average to slightly above average, I make 45k a year and have little to no expenses. I'm looking to take out a $10 000 loan to buy a nicer boat and now we get to my question!

Seeing as multiple attempts will affect my credit score;
Should I apply for a personal loan from a bank?
Line of credit from bank?
or get financing from something like canadarvfinancing.com? I feel like the financing route will potentially offer the best interest rates? Thoughts? I don't want to try and get preapproved with them and then find out that shot down my chances of being approved by a bank.

If I get declined with one, should I try the others? 

The interest rate would have to be pretty high to offset the savings of not paying 800$/month in rent.

I am a 20 year old university student who will be graduating in May with a bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences. I have a savings account with $28,000 which has an interest rate of 0.05%. I am extremely fortunate to be living with my parents rent-free, have no debt, driving a car paid for by my parents, and only pay for the occasional times I eat out, so I am essentially saving 100% of my income, which comes primarily from my academic scholarships and a minimum wage job.

I can't help but feel as though I should be doing something with the money rather than letting it sit there; however, I am ignorant financially. I am extremely scared of stocks, ect. as my father made many mistakes and lost a lot of money dealing with them. This being said, I wanted confirmation from people more knowledgeable/experienced that the best option really is to leave it all in a savings account.

Just some background on myself, I have already been accepted into a pharmacy school which will last another 4 years so I will still be in school for a while. Although I will accrue debt from student loans I will need to pay for the $22,000/year price tag of expected costs, I do not plan to begin payments until I have graduated from school as I believe I can exclusively take out subsidized loans. I will be living at home with my parents rent free for the duration of my schooling. After school, taking for granted that I will find a job reasonably soon after graduating, I will be making a great salary (a google search of the average salary of a pharmacist in my city comes up with ~115k/year, and pharmacists often have starting salaries around 100k/year) so I will do most of my saving then.

My question is if I should continue what I have been doing by working and putting all my money into my savings account where it will sit untouched until I start working as a pharmacist or if I should be putting it in a roth-IRA (I believe that's what my mom called it?) or somewhere else.

I estimated my yearly income as $22K to receive subsidies from the healthcare market place. That is accurate but I had additional income from a temp job that crossed over into 2014 by a couple of months and a 401K cash out that brought my income to $25K. I expected to owe some of the subsidies back but my whole return plus $400 seems crazy to me. Even the customer service guy at healthcare.gov told me that seemed unreal and I should consult a tax professional.

Also I have a current health plan with Anthem that is an automatic renewal from last year and I am receiving subsidies on, about $200/month is taken off the plan. But healthcare.gov shows me as unregistered with no coverage. I'm supposed to send them copies of my W2s to verify income but when I log into my account it says my coverage doesn't exist. I call Anthem and they say my coverage is fine and they are receiving the federal subsidies.

Where did I go wrong and how can I avoid having to pay in the future? I have an appointment for free community tax advice in March (earliest appt). I can't afford to go to an accountant. It seems like with an income as low as mine I shouldn't have to pay.  I don't trust what the Anthem is telling me and I live in fear of receiving another giant bill for money I owe. $400 might not seem like much to some but it is a big blow for me.

personalfinance,Buy a $1M+ house in SF Bay Area or just rent forever?,"tl;dr - can't get what I want for less than $1M, and I can afford that but no more.  Take advantage of current low rates and buy, or stay out of debt for a while longer?

Need a home big enough to house married couple and one set of in-laws.  Around here $1M is pretty much the bare minimum for a decent sized house or condo 1800-2000 sq. ft.  Household income around $250k puts a mortgage at around 30% debt-to-income and vaults our total cash outflow from 6600/mo to 10k/mo (8.75k net after homeowner tax deductions).  We're still therefore saving 3-4k / mo in this scenario so on paper it looks safe.  But frankly most of these $1M homes suck or are in undesirable locations.  To rent a similar house OTOH would be just as expensive as the mortgage payment, but w/o any tax saving and no equity building, so renting is even more stupid.

The frugal thing to do is keep our 2200/mo rental, put in-laws into a cheap apartment, and save for a bigger better house.  But that's just cruel to them as they're moving from a far away low-COL place to help us start a family.  Also by the time we save a bundle chances are appreciation will price us out (again) and interest rates will almost certainly be significantly higher.

Would would r/personalfinance do?  Am I going to be house-poor?

EDIT: thanks everyone for the thoughtful replies.  To those with the harsh reaction to the idea of living with in-laws, that is intended to be temporary for at most a few years.

personalfinance,Help! College is demanding my estranged father's information for FAFSA. Options?,"I apologize ahead of time for the length, its been a tough year so theres a bit of background info. My parents have been separated since basically my birth. My brother and I grew up living with my mom while my father paid child support and had occasional visitations rights. In recent years we've had limited to no contact with him other than his mandated payments. As a result I got a Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver when applying to college and my mother's income was used for my financial aid. (My father makes significantly more $).

Four months before my first semester my mother passed away, she had been sick for entire previous year. Still almost no contact from my father. My brother (22) and I live together in our same house, he works to pay the bills while I go to college and I use any spare college funds to help pay bills. I was turning 18 at the time of my mother's passing. As a result my father stopped all child support and we no longer talk to him, he still keeps me on his health insurance, that's it. 

Fast forward to now, its second semester freshman year. Speaking with my financial aid advisor I was attempting to apply to be an Independent student, unfortunately they denied my because I live with my brother and he pays the bills even though I help. I've maxed out federal grants and loans here due to my mothers very low income. Now they are demanding my father's information on FAFSA for next year. Which will take away all my need based grants and loans and I will no longer be able to afford college. I cant let that happen. Do I have any options here or am I just screwed? 

TL;DR: Parents separated, my mother passed away right before college. College is demanding my father's income on FAFSA despite zero contact. Surprise, college doesn't care and is fucking me over.",finance,1422900976

personalfinance,question about renting property that you own to yourself or a family member,"i'm looking for some advice on a possibly complicated transaction:

My mother's landlord would like to sell her the house that she rents (@ below market rate). He wants the cash to retire and she doesn't want to move. It's a cheap enough house, and she could afford the mortgage, but she can't get a loan right now because she's been working part time and not at the same place the last two years. She's been battling cancer and bounced around a couple different jobs in the last year trying to make her needs and schedule jive with her employer's, so the required 2 year work history isn't there.

So she asked me to help her, which I'd love to do. I see 3 options: 

1. Buy the house as an investment property and rent it to her. **problem is** I don't have the 20% down payment available for an investment property loan, and she can't gift it to me if it's an investment loan.

2. Co-sign with her as a primary home. She can use her own money for the down payment, which she has. **problem is** my lender is telling me that in that case i either have to live in the home myself (no) or she has to be able to qualify on her own (no).

3. Co-sign with her as an investment home. We'll pay a higher down payment and interest rate, but we'll be good to use my credit/income and her down payment cash. 

I have no idea how option 3 would work. Is it kosher for her to rent to herself? or to rent to me and have me claim it tax-wise as a regular investment property, even if she partly owns it? What if I help her with the mortgage, is it kosher for me to pay rent to myself?",finance,1422907175

My wife and I have been working hard to get our debt until control the last few months.  We have finally reached a point where we are better about budgeting.  We are using YNAB to keep track of where our spending is going and have actually made some real progress.

We currently have about $12,000 of credit card debt spread across multiple cards with interest rates between 14 and 19% or so.  We had looked into some sort of debt consolidation loan before but stayed away at the time because we were worried we would just end up with the loan AND get the credit cards high again due to our poor budgeting.  We are more confident we can handle it now.

So as long as we are good about paying off the cards and not building up a debt again, if we took out a loan for that amount at about 9% APR and paid it off over 3-4 years we should be saving a significant amount of money in interest fees.

personalfinance,My dad's house is in my name. Now he wants to cash-out refi. Good idea / bad idea?,"Hang on, it's a long one.

I'm in my low 30s. Back in late 2008, in my mid 20s, after the crash, my Dad had some serious problems. He had bought a $1.2 million house in 2007, took out additional loans to build a pool house and a salt-water black bottom pool, and his business was in real estate. He had a ridiculous mortgage he couldn't pay, and no discernible income.

So he asked for help. He was fundamentally against the idea of renting, but after losing his other house, had no means of buying another. He had $40k in cash, and zero credit. He just needed someone he trusted to sign on the dotted line. So I did.

Whether that was wise or not is long gone. He lives in the house, and the house has appreciated quite a bit.

Now, I've got my own home, family, kids. A good job paying over $110,000 annually, my wife makes about $60,000 annually. For the last three years I've been able to put the maximum into both my company-sponsored 401k, and our Roth IRAs. What's left over goes into a Vanguard index fund. We've got our house in one of those PenFed 5/5 2.65% ARMs as we're planning on moving to a better school district home in 2-3 years, so the payment is very low.

My dad has not done so well.  He hasn't worked regularly in a long time. He does property management which allows him to pay the mortgage bi-weekly on the house I signed for him (he is not on the mortgage), and to pay for food and utilities, but saves very little.

His house, still has $208,000 outstanding principal at a 4.875% interest rate, and the two bi-weekly payments combined total $1600, and while I used to worry he'd be able to cover it, he hasn't missed a payment in 6 years.

I *thought* the reason I had to sign was because he had filed for bankruptcy and was looking forward to disentangling our finances in a year, but it turns out he never filed. I actually don't know what that means for him, or his credit, but I do know he holds no credit cards and has no bank accounts, which suggests to me that he owes somebody, possibly the IRS, a lot of money.

The problem is this: He's been driving the same car for a decade now, and it's on its last legs. The transmission is going out. He's going for his real-estate license again and says he's going to need a reliable car that will allow him to both continue property management and take clients around (so, it needs to be clean).  That means an SUV.  And we could probably pick a used one up that meets those specifications for around $15,000.

Of course he doesn't have $15,000.  I'm actually not sure how good he'll be as an agent again. He used to be pretty decent, but was part of a husband-wife team where she clearly was the stronger agent of the two. And he hasn't done it in a while.  

So I told him, it's fine, I can just buy him one, $15,000 on a loan or whatever. We're doing fine and can afford it without any trouble. But he doesn't want to, something about pride. Instead what he wants to do is refinance the house, cash-out $75,000. He has a deal in place to increase his monthly payment by $100, cash-out $75,000, 4% interest, no closing costs.  Zillow puts the home at $376,000, but I'd probably value it closer to $300,000-$340,000 (I used to appraise professionally, but don't have access to the same tools I used to to comp check it). $210,000 is owed on the home still.

So that's the deal.

I'm thinking it might not be a bad idea to cash-out, and place that money in an index fund garnering hopefully closer to 7%, no closing costs, while lowering his interest rate and giving him a little money to the needed new car.

But I'd rather not raise his monthly payment, as I'm not even really sure how much his income is right now, or how he even manages to pay the $1600 a month he comes up with now.

What should I do? Should I audit his finances, figure out what his monthly income ACTUALLY is (I'm not sure if I even can, all cash, remember)?

Cash-out refinance, but stipulate the deal needs to be redone to not raise the monthly payment?

Cash-out, but stipulate it should only be for the $15,000 he needs for the car and lower his monthly payment?

Not worry about the monthly payment, try to get the interest rate down as low as possible and whatever we cash out stick in a presumably higher return index fund?

Keep in mind, his name can't be on any accounts (for whatever reason), so I hold the key so it's not like he can just up and run with the $75k, not that I'd expect him to.

Any additional angles I'm missing? Any other numbers you need?

Thanks in advance.",finance,1422920190

This is my first year preparing my taxes for myself -- [I made a previous post on this subreddit explaining why](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2llylr/should_i_let_my_parents_claim_me_as_a_dependent/).  Because of those issues, I'd just like to run these numbers by you guys to make sure I've got all my ducks ordered correctly.


I went through TurboTax online, but I've been contemplating going to one of the VITA tax preparers just to be safe.  I'm worried because another grad student in my program mentioned independent contractor taxes, but I don't know why that would apply to me.


Vitals:
Single, no dependents.  I live in VA but work in DC.  Full time graduate student.


W2

* (1) Income:  $3206.73

* (2) Fed income tax withheld: $194.73

* (16) State wages: $3206.73

* (17) State income tax: $127.00


1098-T

* (2) Amount billed for qualified tuition expenses: $26,403.75

* (5) Scholarships/Grants: $31,388.00


Additional details


* I don't think I had any job-related expenses (I traveled for work but got reimbursed, and books, etc. don't count), but I did pay about $970 in medical expenses.


* Turbotax asks me how much of the scholarship from (5) of the 1098T was already reported as income in the W2.  I believe it was all of it, because the scholarship should be my only income ($3206.73).


* Turbotax asks me if I paid for room/board with my scholarship.  I'm assuming that (5) on my 1098T represents the fellowship that I received as take-home pay.  I had $11,340 expenses for rent last year.  Do I report this here?


* Although my parents are now withholding my previous years' tax returns, I can be assured that they've already claimed the American Opportunity/Hope credits as much as they were able.


* I have also had medical insurance throughout the year.


This has ended with Turbotax telling me I'll get around $200 in federal back but owe $413 in VA state taxes.  Does this sound right?  Do I need to be aware of an additional tax burden for independent contractors (what are the requirements for being classified as one?)?

Also note that certain years social security is estimated, because I had a bit of self employment income in there as well.

EDIT: Resolved...somewhat. **IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE USING TURBOTAX AND PERFORMING A BACKDOOR ROTH** So TurboTax changed the way they do things as always, and it's basically impossible to know how to account for a Backdoor Roth this year unless you know exactly what's going on. I just ended a 30-minute call with a specialist at TurboTax and he had to walk me through the entire thing. So on the one screen where it asks if you've had any nondeductible contributions **for 2013 or prior years**, you select YES even though this is about 2014. It will ask you for your 2013 contribution. PUT IN YOUR 2014 INFO. It will then ask for you to write out an explanation for why this happened, and you put in something like ""Nondeductible Traditional contribution, converted to Roth"". I have a feeling a lot of individuals are going to have TurboTax fuck them over and have them pay taxes on nondeductible contributions by their lack of intuitiveness this year.

The specialist didn't think it was a big deal when I asked if this issue was going to be resolved. He just said ""Eh, backdoor roth's are so uncommon we don't really have this issue much"". So in other words no, they'd rather have everyone call up and annoy their specialists rather than take a few minutes to reword their questions. Anyways, hope this helps!",finance,1422927729

personalfinance,"Collection agency declared my validation letter ""frivolous or irrelevant."" What now?","EDIT: Fixed some formatting

Hi /personalfinance, first time poster; long time lurker.

TLDR: Like the title says, collection agency deemed my request for validation frivolous, what now?

Apologies for the wall of text coming up. I recently took the plunge to get my affairs in order and got a rundown of what I have in collections through creditkarma. I had gotten a call from a collection agency in regards to my student loans, which are in default. I don't remember what the total amount of them were or to who I owe them to, being an irresponsible youth, and so I requested that they not call me and instead send me a letter with the information. 

I got a letter a few weeks later with a total amount that I owe to Transworld of a little under 4,000; an amount I don't see anywhere on my credit report. So, I sent the following as a validation letter which I cent certified and they got 1/20/15 (the letter said I should send it to Navient, hence their name instead of Transworld):

Re: Acct # XXXXXXXX  
To Whom It May Concern,  

I am sending this letter to you in response to a notice I received from you on 1/6/2015. Be advised, this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 (b) that your claim is disputed and validation is requested.

This is NOT a request for ""verification"" or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your
office provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.

Please provide me with the following:  
- What the money you say I owe is for;  
- Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe;  
- Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe;  
- Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable;  
- Identify the original creditor;  
- Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account;  
- Show me that you are licensed to collect in my state; and  
- Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent.  

If your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the three major Credit Bureau's (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion), said action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you for the following:

- Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act  
- Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act  
- Defamation of Character  

If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist.

Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel. This includes any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate when in fact there is no provided proof that it is.

If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately.

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your offices to my home or to my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls or correspondence sent to any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter.

This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

I just received in the mail today their response:

We recently received your letter regarding your account being reported to the consumer reporting agencies. Because you have not procided sufficient information for us to determine the exact nature of your dispute, the Fair Credit Reporting Act deems this inquiry ""frivolous or irrelevant.""

Without additional information, we're unable to investigate your dispute. In order to throughly research your inquiry, we need you to:

- Identify the specific information in question

- A copy of your credit report  
- Canceled checks  
- Bank Statement  
- Other information you deem as important

personalfinance,(AUS/US) Would appreciate advice on multi-country investing.,"First time posting here, though I've been a frequent visitor. I've been reading all the information here, but it's possible I've missed something so I apologize if I'm asking something silly.

I'm an US citizen who moved to Australia to be with my partner, who is an Australian citizen.  We're not married as of yet, but we're in a de facto relationship and have joint funds.  We just changed banks to take advantage of higher interest rates and lower fees.  I have no debt. My partner has university debt, but it's interest free and comes out in his taxes so it's nothing we really worry about.  We have no children (though don't tell our dog and cat) and don't plan to anytime terribly soon--maybe 4/5 years from now.  We do both have Superannuation accounts here (which are Aus versions of 401ks as far as I can tell), our contributions come out automatically with each paycheck.  As my paycheck is significantly smaller than my partner's, my Super fund isn't anything exciting at this point but his is about 40k now.

In our Australian bank account, we now have about 25k in a high interest savings account (4% interest rate), which we're hoping to deposit about $2600 a month.  We're planning to us this money to eventually be a down payment on our first house.  We currently rent and have no current plans to buy in Australia as the housing market here is out of range.  However, we are planning to move to the US in about two or three years and would be looking into buying a house there, so we don't want the money tied up for any length of time.  

Apart from our money here, I have another 25k or so in a few bank accounts back in the US.  Most of this money has just been released from bonds my lovely grandparents set up for me, so I haven't really had to consider what to do with it before now.  I generally get a bit of money as gifts from family each year that I would add to this annually.  The past two years it's been about 5k.

I think we're currently doing alright with our money in Australia (though let me know if you think we could be doing something better), but I'm not sure what would be my best options for the money in the US. From what I've read, most people suggest putting money into a retirement fund such as an IRA, but I'm not 100% sure if I can open one while I live and work in Australia.  I do file my taxes in the US as I should, but I don't make enough here to actually have to pay any.  Also, if I've been reading things correctly, it looks like I wouldn't be able to put all my money into an IRA all at once, as they have limits, so what would I do with the rest of it?  We could be putting more directly into my partner's super, which I believe his employer would match (just checked this, they only match the standard amount); would that be better to do and then put the 25k into some investment not retirement focused? 

Though I have been doing my best to read up on things, I really am not sure what our best options would be.  My father is looking into things for me as well, but I'd like to be able to make informed decisions as well.

They refunded me on the phone and blocked that merchant from making additional charges.  I have no other disputes ever on this account and my credit history with Chase goes back 10 years.

Unfortunately I have another situation where I probably need to file a dispute, for about $80. I bought something online, the company messed up the shipping, and they're being totally unresponsive. My package was supposed to be delivered last week but it's been sitting in the state it's supposed to be coming from because it has multiple shipping labels on it. FedEx said this happens in error sometimes and that it might not even be my package since there was obviously a mistake when they were packing/labeling the boxes. 

Either way, they will not let me fix this, the shipper has to take action. I spoke to their customer service one time(it's just one person), and she told me that she got my email and would send me a new tracking number. She emailed me, and it was the same tracking number. She has not responded to my emails since, and the customer service number has gone straight to voicemail each time I call. I've sent two polite emails asking if there was a mixup and if I should expect a different package, or if not could she please contact FedEx. No response.

I thought about /r/techsupport but given the posting guidelines they have it felt like a less appropriate place.  My apologies if this does not belong here.  Advice on a more appropriate subreddit to put this in will be greatly appreciated.

I have a large number of bootleg concerts that I have burnt to dvds in dvd-video format.  Unfortunately I did not stop to think about how much of a nightmare I was creating for myself to sort, store and playback this content.  Not until I had burnt ~1000 of the things.  I now seek to put them back on a harddrive to make them more easily accessible and because I have concerns that consumer grade DVDs degrade in time (although I understand there are varying schools of thoughts on the life of burnt dvds).  

I have a feeling I'm completely stuffed and the only way to return these dvds to a harddrive is to manually copy the VIDEO_TS folder one disc at a time which I estimate to take about an average 12 minutes a disc (allowing for me to do something while I'm waiting and probably get distracted more often than not).  12 minutes a disc equals approximately 200 hours constant ripping by my math.  What I'm after is suggestions from anyone for a more efficient way of archiving these discs.

Have you had to do this or something similar before?  Is there perhaps a commercial service that might do this for me?  Is there a possibility of outsourcing this to some person in India to do for me at a reasonable price?

Additional info - Due to the nature of the content, I cannot just go and download this stuff again.  Most all of it surfaces on torrent sites for about a week or two and then the torrent dies.  Other people have trade lists of concerts but that still requires a lot of work and no-one is going to want to help me out with more than 10 concerts at a time and even then they will want 10 concerts in return and it will need to be concerts they don't have.

At work we have a (the name may be slightly wrong) Discmaster device which can duplicate about 50-100 dvds at a time however the person who currently has it doesn't use it or know much about it.

I live with my girlfriend and her roommate. The roommate pays 50% of all shared bills and I pay the other 50%. My gf pays nothing, ever. Not for her gas, phone, or car. Doesn't have a job. Working towards obtaining a RE Brokers license. She's very expensive.

In January I gave her a deadline of March to obtain her license. She already has the class and state exam passed. Just needs to pass the Federal exam. Beginning in March I'll only be paying for 25% of shared bills and stop paying for her stuff of everything in life.

So what can I do to start saving 50% of all my income? I really want to do this but something always comes up!!!

software,I'm looking for a new email client.,"I have about a dozen email addresses and Thunderbird used to work flawlessly. I recently had to make a change to one of my accounts and now said account does not alert me when I have new mail... being that it is my most time sensitive account, that's a deal breaker. (Yes, I have tried to fix it and the only thing that worked (turning alerts off, restarting, turning alerts on, restarting) was only temporary it seems.

I tried Outlook 2013 (I have an office subscription), however the account list on the left side needs to be partially expanded and when I do that I can't see all accounts at once (scrolls off screen).

Way back when, I guess about 2002, I used Outlook express and all accounts fed into the same inbox (and I had a column for account, so I knew what account the emails were for). I think I would like a client that does that. I see there are some workarounds to do this in Outlook 2013 and they appear to be pretty messy and I'm not sure how well they work. 

I have a mix of IMAP and POP3. I'm frequently checking from my desktop and phone.

personalfinance,"Which should be my priority upon graduation: student loans, or retirement saving?","I am 24 years old and will be starting my career this summer and am contracted to have a starting salary of $120,844. My spouse currently salaries at $55,000 a year, bringing our combined household income to $175,844. These are both pre-tax. However, university left me with a pretty hefty student loan burden and I currently owe about $249,000 in debt plus whatever interest accumulates between now and when I start my job, which will probably be late July or early August. I graduate in May, so my loans are in deferment until November.

Currently, we have minimal credit card debt. My spouse is pretty much our only source of income at the moment, so after tax and retirement contributions we take home around $3100 a month.
Nondiscretionary spending:

Rent/water: $840

Electric: ~$30
Gas: with the lower prices we've been averaging $100-150 total

Phone: $120

Car insurance: $210 (unfortunately this is the lowest price we can get due to the area where we live)

Car payment: $225

Internet: $45

Renter insurance: $10

Total: $1580-1630


Currently, that leaves us with around $1500 afterward to budget with. Budgeting $500 for groceries, we're left with $1000 for discretionary spending. However, this will go up significantly to ~$10,000 after tax once I start working.


My student loans range in interest rates. From highest interest rate to lowest:
$35,531.97 at 8.25%

$36,563.69 at 7.90%

$87,013.92 at 6.80%

$7,573.28 at 6.41%

$33,519.33 at 6.21%

$3,500 at 6.00%

$3,478.73 at 5.60%

$39,599.52 at 5.41%

$5,500.00 at 4.50%

(Not sure if this breakdown is helpful, but I figure more info is better than less)


My plan of attack was to minimize my retirement saving until the student loans are paid down. My place of employment matches dollar-for-dollar the first 5% of my income that I contribute to my 401k, so I was planning on contributing only 5% for the first few years. They also offer a 15% discount on company stock off the lower FMV from the beginning and end of our offering period, but I am unsure if I should contribute income to the employee stock purchase plan at this time. I can contribute up to 15% of my income to this plan.


With this plan, if I contribute *my* entire monthly income to my student loans and we live solely on my spouse's income, I figure I could pay $7,000 a month on my loans starting with the higher interest rate ones and hopefully have the debt paid down within 3-4 years. I would be contributing ~$12,000 a year toward my 401k including the company's match if I do not put any additional income toward retirement. My spouse also has a 401k where he contributes 4% of his income and the company doubles his contribution, so he is putting away ~$6,600 a year for retirement. 


I guess I'm just overwhelmed because of the huge number on my student loans... but does this plan seem feasible? 

Should I be focusing on student loans first before retirement, or should I start contributing more money toward retirement now? 

Is it worth my while to contribute money to my employee stock purchasing plan at this point, or should I wait until my student loans are paid down more?

At what point is it fiscally responsible for us to start consider buying a home? We were hoping for within the next few years, but this is going to depend a lot on how quickly I can pay down my loans.

personalfinance,We're working on our debt and read Dave Ramsey's 'Total Money Makeover'. Is his advice sound?,"Hello!

My wife and I are working to get our debt eliminated.  We don't have any credit cards, but we have a ridiculous sum in student loans.  Combined, we owe just shy of $120,000.  So... we were idiots, basically.  Our annual income is ~$70,000.  After we make required monthly payments and budget for necessities we have a bit more than $1,700 left.

Dave Ramsey suggests we put $1,000 in the bank right away for emergencies.  Makes sense, though this will obviously only take care of small emergencies.  Next, he advises paying off our smallest loans to begin our 'debt snowball'.  I'm not sure about this, personally.  It seems like it's more for psychology than money saving advice.  Wouldn't it make sense to pay off our highest interest loans first?  For example, I have one loan for ~$10k with a 9% interest rate (couldn't get a co-signer to bring it down, I was stupid, blah blah blah).  My lowest loans are in the neighborhood of $1,000, but have interest rates around 4%.  Wouldn't it make more sense to pay off that 9% loan first?

His investing advice seemed a little too optimistic as well, though at this point I don't think that's something I need to worry about until after we've taken care of our debt.

financialindependence,Taking advantage of Obama's student loan forgiveness program: A unique FIRE strategy,"I went to law school. Law school was expensive. And I didn't get the job I wanted or needed to pay the loans back.

Thankfully, Obama came to save the day with [Income-Driven repayment plans.](https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven)

What are those, you say? Well, they allow me to lower my loan payments by about 95% of what they should be, without consequences -- and when I say without consequences, I mean **my loan is going to be completely forgiven.** Here's how.

[Income-based Repayment, Pay As You Earn, and Income-Contingent Repayment](https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans) all allow me to lower my payments to **10% of discretionary income,** which is defined as the difference between Adjusted Gross Income and 150% of the Poverty Guideline.

Let's break that down. [Poverty guidelines](http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/14poverty.cfm) show that for a family of two, 150% of poverty line income is $23,595 (15,730*1.5). Let's say you make an average income: around $50k. $50,000 - $23,595 = $26,405. That's your discretionary income. Now your payment, **regardless of how large your loan is**, will be 10% of that: only **$2,640.50.** 

That's right. You can take out hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans and pay only $2,640.50 per year.

Now you might say: well, that loan's gonna come due some time. Except...it's not. In fact, after 20 or 25 years (depending on program you select), that loan is forgiven. At that point, a $100,000 has ballooned into a $230,000 (and in some cases $350,000) monster -- which is obliterated by the federal government. 

Tricky part: in some cases, you are responsible for the tax consequences of having a loan forgiven, which could mean between a $69,000 and $105,000 tax bill due.

Now, that might sound scary, but think of this: *that's in 20 years.* You basically get to go to school and live for free for up to 10 years if you get your doctorate and then pay between 50% and 70% of the cost of your education...20 years later.

Between now and then, you can use that money you WOULD have used paying off the loan to invest. You get your career going. You start a family (which, by the way, raises your poverty guideline and thus lowers your monthly payments) and take advantage of dual income. You basically have 20 years to build up the FI system to be able to handle a $50-100k hit within a year.

I put this out there because this is exactly the strategy I am using. I will be investing my income into a corporation I control and reinvesting those (untaxed) gains within the corporation such that I have an entire side business that doesn't show up on the books (and therefore doesn't cause me to pay more on loan or in taxes) and that can pay for travel expenses, cars, parties, charity donations, etc.

As far as I know, no one is taking advantage of this program in this way, and I'd like to have some feedback on it.

Edit: I'm looking for feedback on a financial plan that might help me FIRE. None of the above is illegal, and I'm not talking about tax evasion. Assume legality throughout the plan. Thanks.

Edit2: Changes made to my FIRE plan as result of below feedback: find 501(c)(3) to work in, which will give me access to Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan, removing the ""tax bomb"" inherent in the other income-based repayment plans. Under that plan I would pay around 50k over 10 years and then have loans forgiven. Also, learned how to implement comparison spreadsheets to accurately compare different plans (including inflation which I had left out of previous estimates). Finally, I learned that FI has a significantly negative view of tax-advantaged federal programs and loopholes such as corporate business expenditures that coincide with personal gain. I was surprised by this and hope to continue that conversation later.

Thanks for the feedback for those who had real criticism of the financial plan! I appreciate your honest assessments and comparisons.",finance,1422990578

Feels good, but have a few questions.","As the title states, this week marks the first week since '99 that I have not had to make a credit card payment.  During college in the late '90s and early '00s my wife and I got about a dozen credit cards and over the next 10 years started maxing those suckers out. 

This mostly came from things like paying car insurance, cable/phone/electric bills, a few months of rent here and there, gas, food, clothes, books for school, my wife's entire master's degree, and a bunch of other nonsense. At this point we have exactly nothing to show for all of this money that was put onto the cards other than her degree.

By 2009 we had accumulated a little over 80k in credit card debt between the two of us and our minimum payments were  $1600 per month. We were getting absolutely nowhere since the interest rates ratcheted up to ~29% even though we never missed a single payment on any of the cards.  The minimum payments were only barely covering the interest, it kind of sucked.  

I was discussing the prospect of bankruptcy with a friend of ours and he mentioned that he had the same problem and was doing credit counseling through a nonprofit organization to avoid the BK.  We called the debt counselors up in April of 2010 and it turns out we were a good fit for their program.  They acted as a mediator between us and the CC companies, negotiated MUCH lower rates (between 3 and 7%) on all of the cards and got us on a structured payment plan where we paid ~$1400 per month for 60 months until the debts were paid. Now here we are in February of 2015, almost 5 years later (we made some doble payments here and there to pay off early) and we're officially free of CC debt!   

**Here's the question though**.  As I mentioned, most of these cards we've had since the '90s so they have a long credit history.  Should I keep a couple of the oldest ones open and use them for auto-draft payments on things like insurance, electricity, etc that I can pay off every month or should I let them close?  Is there a need for me to have 10 open accounts with ~90k of available credit?  I've never really been in this situation before so I'm not entirely sure what to do.

CryptoCurrency,What Aspect Of Cryptocurrency or Digital Currency Has The Greatest Potential To Do Good In The World?,"I know a lot of the news surrounding cryptocurrencies tends to revolve around finance, funding, markets, and price. But a lot of the early momentum behind bitcoin came because of the altruistic intentions of its early developers (for instance the disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto, and the contributions of the late Hal Finney). I know from personal conversations and correspondence that similar altruism exists still within both bitcoin and the cryptocurrency community at large. It just seems to get drowned out more often than not by other news.

This year Bill and Melinda Gates are also looking to bring banking to the developing world. 

&gt; ""Instead, the poor use financial services that are extremely inefficient. They save by hiding cash around the house or buying commodities that lose value over time. When they send money to friends and relatives to help them through tough times, they either take a day off and deliver the cash themselves or trust someone else to do it for them. If they need to borrow money for an emergency, they have to pay usurious interest rates to a moneylender. Not having access to a range of cheap and easy financial services makes it much more difficult to be poor."" - Gates Foundation Annual Letter 2015

The other day in his AMA Bill Gates explicitly stated that the Gates Foundation was not looking to use bitcoin for their projects because some of its qualities weren't well suited for their uses. However, he did mention that the technology behind bitcoin is important.

What is your take on the potential for digital currency and/or cryptocurrencies to do good in the world? 

In what ways can we use digital currency and innovation in banking and finance to improve the state of the world?

What attributes do you think the current set of digital currencies and cryptocurrencies are missing that would be required to make them better candidates for adoption by the type of people the Gates Foundation is seeking to help?",cryptocurrency,1423009174

gaming,battlefield Hardline just isn't up to scrap.,"I'm getting a bit fed up with game developers producing little to no content as far as multiplayer gaming is concerned. Companies should start focusing on improving existing formulas and add monetization, instead of shoe horning unfinished AAA games with barely any extra content. Hardline is a small upgrade to BF4 for two reasons:



* **The amount of content does not warrant $60.** The new gamemodes are capture the flag and conquest with a twist on them: objectives are now moving. While that sounds good, is it worth $60? My wallet says no. The rest of the game plays like battlefield 4, things like gun recoil and soldier movement are literally taken from battlefield 4, as well as classes being super similar from game to game. I struggle to see how this game isn't BF4 without moving objectives and some new gadgets. The extra game modes, vehicles, and unlockables are the same amount you get from a $15 DLC for BF4 or BF3

* **UI and overall improvements should have been put in BF4.** To capture a point, you must be in the radius of the flag. To know where the radius is, a grey circle appears on the minimap letting you know where the capture is and isn't. Holy shit, where would this be easily added? Couldn't be battlefield 4, could it? And wow, now you can Kustomize your red dot sights for your weapons! Shut up and take my money!

We got the card on the 24 months no interest if we spent enough money, which we did and paid that off within the first two years. Then we racked up some charges after some unfortunate events occurred, including my sister passing away and some unexpected medical expenses. 

Current Balance is $6,300 and the current interest rate is 25.24% (YIKES). 

So the interest is killing us right now. We are paying at least $100 a month in interest. 

I have several options for balance transfers. That info is below.  
Balance transfer options
0.00% Promo APR Until 05/01/2016.
25.24% Variable APR After 05/01/2016

3.99% Promo APR Until 01/01/2017.

Either $10 or 5% of the amount of each transaction, whichever is greater, but for this offer, until 04/01/2015, $149 maximum.

What other options do we have besides the balance transfer? My wife and I both have solid credit scores. I know we can't pay off the card in 14 months so I know we will be back in same situation come May 1st, 2016 if we do the balance transfer. The most we can likely pay is $150 per month on the card.

personalfinance,Pro Bono: Williams &amp; Connolly LLP,"Williams &amp; Connolly LLP has been recognized for its lawyers' significant commitment to pro bono. The firm partners with Maryland Public Defender's Offices to take criminal cases to trial and on appeal, and with the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs to represent individuals seeking asylum in the United States. Since 2001, more than 90 Williams &amp; Connolly LLP attorneys have handled trial-level felony cases through a pro bono partnership that the Montgomery County, Maryland Public Defender's Office has called an ""amazing success.""
Representative pro bono matters include representing plaintiffs in civil rights lawsuits, low-income individuals in housing, and wage and benefits cases for indigent tenants in the District of Columbia, military veterans in benefits appeals, and District of Columbia parolees in parole revocation hearings. The firm has been recognized by the DC Circuit Judicial Standing Committee on Pro Bono Legal Services for the depth and breadth of its pro bono commitment.  It also has received the Outstanding Achievement Award of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs for its work on asylum and immigrants' rights cases.  


The DC Bar Pro Bono Program recognized the firm for its work with the Affordable Housing Preservation Project and the Landlord Tenant Resource Center, and for joining the DC Bar Pro Bono Partnership. Bread for the City recently named the firm Pro Bono Legal Partner of the Year for work on behalf of tenants. 


The firm is a signatory to the Pro Bono Institute's Law Firm Pro Bono Challenge and the District of Columbia Bar's Pro Bono Initiative, and has launched a Consumer Law Resource Center with the DC Bar Pro Bono Program. 


Williams &amp; Connolly LLP lawyers have achieved significant victories for pro bono clients at trial, on appeal and at hearings.  The firm is currently handling two post-conviction death penalty cases -- one involving application of recent Supreme Court precedent regarding the rights of mentally retarded defendants and one involving habeas review of the first federal death sentence handed down in the First Circuit. The firm successfully represented an unarmed person shot by the United States Park Police. At trials in several matters, Williams &amp; Connolly LLP lawyers won acquittals for criminal defendants in a burglary trial, in a credit card and identity theft case, on charges of assault, and others.  Williams &amp; Connolly LLP lawyers twice overturned a client's murder conviction in the Maryland Court of Appeals after trying the case, and have tried many other cases for pro bono clients.  The firm also vacated convictions on appeal based on the state's failure to turn over evidence to defense counsel prior to trial, for insufficiency of the evidence, on standing grounds to challenge a search, and by demonstrating the inapplicability of the transferred intent doctrine. 


In asylum cases, firm lawyers successfully represented a political activist who had been persecuted in Cameroon, a missionary from the Congo, and received a grant of asylum after an evidentiary hearing for a family based on the fear that the women would face mutilation if forced to return to Egypt.  The firm also successfully helped overturn in the Second Circuit a Board of Immigration Appeals decision denying asylum to women from Guinea. The Center for Gender and Refugee Studies has honored the firm for its outstanding contributions. The firm also obtained permission for a nonprofit organization to credential poll watchers in Maryland for the 2004 Presidential election. Young lawyers at the firm have also successfully represented a number of clients in parole revocation evidentiary hearings.


Williams &amp; Connolly LLP employees also serve the community outside the courtroom. They volunteer to teach at Dunbar Senior High School, which earned the firm the Outstanding Achievement Award of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.

personalfinance,I'm finally comfortable financially after getting a new job! I'm seeking any and all advice to optimize my finances and attain a few things that have previously been out of my reach financially without losing that comfortable feeling.,"Hello, /r/personalfinance! I am posting my budget and long- &amp; short-term plans for any guidance, criticism, or commendation that you may have. I just started a new job about three months ago and want to make sure I'm on the right track. Sorry if this is a bit verbose, I've got a lot in my head and wanted to get it out for others' analysis. If I should split this into sevaral smaller posts, please let me know.

(TL;DR: Net income of ~600 per month after all expenses &amp; savings, and close to $10,000 in the bank. Wanting to move out on my own, pay down loans, get a new car, and eventually save up for a house. Just wanting to know if it's feasible with my current finances and if I'm on the right financial track.)

For a bit of background financial information, I bring home $2327.19 per month after having the cost for health, dental, and vision insurance deducted from my paycheck. My employer makes a defined monthly contribution of $267.75 to my retirement account, which currently has close to $550. I have around $3000 in my checking account, $1000 in my savings account (at a 0.10% interest rate), and about $250 in an online savings account (at a 0.99% interest rate). I also have a CD that has close to $6,000 and has low interest rate of around 0.30%, but I can't touch that until the end of this year or I'll incur a penalty.

As for my expenses, I have $1,728.42 in total spending. I contribute 10% of my paycheck to my online savings accoung and another 10% to my retirement fund. The only debt I have are three student loans at the amounts and rates listed below, with a combined monthly payment of $172.48. I'm curently paying twice the monthly payment, though, and am paid ahead by six months. 

After all is said and done, $2,327.19 in income and $1,728.42 in total spending leaves me with a net income of around $600 per month.

For my short-term plans, I eventually want to move out of the house I rent with roommates (and their two inside dogs...) and get a place to myself. I live in a college town with plenty of failry inexpensive housing, so I think I can rent an apartment or duplex close to my place of work for $550 or below. I don't have any idea on how this will affect my utility bills, but I expect them to go up to around $200 at the most.

I will also try to eat in more often, bike to work instead of driving, and get a cheaper phone plan for my personal line and phone (my work also provides me a work phone). All of the previous should cut down on my current expenses and help me gain more savings &amp; pay down my debt quicker.

I also plan on taking my tax return (estimated at $500) along with about $650 of my cash reserves and paying off Loan 3. I know this probably isn't the most optimal way of doing things, but I love the feeling of paying off a loan. I had a car loan that I recently wiped out, and the combined benefits of the freed-up money and one less loan on the ledger felt great.

For the mid-term, I will need to buy a newer car. My current one is slowly losing MPG, has been wrecked (body damage, but it's been fixed), and is getting up there in both age and mileage. I plan on driving it until it either absolutely dies or costs too much money to continuously repair. I expect to need to get a car within a year or two, but I have started to formulate a budget and a plan for this purchase. My requirements for the new car are that it be relatively new, have relatively low mileage, and have a good MPG.

As for my long-term goal, I want to begin saving for a house in the area I currently live in. The houses that I've looked at and look to be decent starter homes range from $55,000 to $110,000. I plan on living in it for the forseeeable future, and rent it out when I want or need to move to another place. If I stay in the area, I plan on doing this with a string of houses. If I move out of the area, though, I don't know if I'd keep it and rent it out or sell it. This section is a lot of speculation, and only may be able to happen if I get a promotion, raise, or new job.

I also have a few questions on my mind. I would like to optimize my finances, but I'm unsure of how much money to allocate to each account or purpose. Would it be wise to put around $3,000 into my online savings account (the account that garners the most interest), and use what I don't need to live month-to-month on debt repayment? And, all things considered, what would the best way to approach my finances be? I would like to think I've got it pretty well under control, but I feel like I can fine-tune it overall.

Again, sorry about the wall of text, but I wanted to present the most information possible to aid discussion. I am open to any and all suggestions, criticism, or observations. If you need or want any other piece of information, please ask. Thank you for reading through this and thank you for any and all responses.

At the moment i can trade in for $18100 and i still owe $22000. My question is should I sell and cover the difference in cash and maybe get a cheaper vehicle that I can pay of quicker . Please keep in mind the new vehicle will not come with the current maintenance and service plan i currently have.

Also keep in mind that the cash i will use to settle the difference is mostly my emergency fund ( I can replenish it real quick) . I just feel that spending a third of my salary every month on a vehicle i barely drive is a waste and Id like to get out the best possible way.",finance,1423038629

In normal times a bond fund would be the obvious answer, but with interest rates so low, I'm concerned about a bond bubble.

investing,"The Danish Krone-Euro peg, and negative mortgage interest in wake of the broken Franc-Euro peg.","Danish News have been running this story nationally for some weeks now, and things are getting crazy. Basically currency speculation in the danish Krone is threatening the Crown-Euro peg - If the peg is removed, and the danish krone goes free float, it will probably rise like a rocket, like we saw with the swizz franc. Which just puts on more pressure. Here are some excerpts and some sources:


&gt; Denmark has certainly taken some unusual steps to defend the krone. It surprisingly suspended sales of all government debt to close down an avenue for investors to buy its currency.

&gt; This is after it tried cutting interest rates and buying up its own currency. The Danish central bank has pushed its interest rate deeper into negative territory to a record low of -0.5% after three rate cuts in two weeks - the last being triggered by the Swiss giving up their three-year euro cap.

&gt; So, Denmark's borrowing cost - the yield on 10-year government bonds - has dropped to the lowest in the world, apart from Switzerland which has a negative yield. Were it to borrow, Denmark would pay only 0.16%, which is lower than Germany at 0.31% and even Japan at 0.36%. Germany's borrowing costs, by the way, fell below Japan's for the first time today, so it looks worrying as the eurozone's benchmark bond is experiencing deflationary pressures.


...


&gt; However, a positive side effect for borrowers of the negative interest rate is that for the first time, a Danish lender, Nordea Kredit, is reportedly paying mortgage holders to borrow money by charging a negative interest rate. But others are not following suit as it's unclear how to handle a negative interest rate.

&gt; Indeed, there are calls now in Europe to fashion IT systems and discuss how to manage negative interest rates. There's an estimated $4 trillion of sovereign debt, including even 10-year Swiss bonds, which have negative yields.






Source: http://www.bbc.com/news/business-31109124






&gt; The Danish central bank, Nationalbanken, said it bought foreign currency worth 106.3 billion Danish kroner ($16.34 billion) last month as part of its market interventions.

&gt; The bank said its total foreign-exchange reserves rose by 106.6 billion kroner to 564.1 billion kroner, including market interventions and net borrowing by the central bank.

&gt; In December, the central bank didn’t intervene in the foreign-exchange market.

&gt; The sudden rise in its market activity reflects Nationalbanken’s efforts to counter the upward pressure on the krone as investors move funds to Denmark seeking better returns than they can get in the eurozone.


...


&gt;  Nationalbanken seeks to hold the euro’s exchange rate within 2.25% either above or below 7.46038 kroner to keep inflation low and provide stability for exporters.

&gt; Denmark has cut its deposit rate to minus 0.5% and suspended issuance of bonds by the government to deflect foreign investments away from the country. By cutting the supply of bonds, it raises prices and lowers yields, making Danish bonds less appealing to investors.



...



&gt; Analysts at Swedish bank SEB said Switzerland gave up the franc ceiling after selling Swiss francs for the equivalent of 80% of gross domestic product, while Denmark has so far sold Danish kroner amounting to around 30% of GDP.

Profile:

27 year old  
Salary - $63000, with $200/ month in truck reimbursements and ~$10k/year in bonuses  
Mortgage - $1,385/month PITI  
Auto - $335/month @ 4% ($8,256 remaining) 2008 Chevy Silverado  
Personal Loan - $425/month @ 9%  
Credit Card - $425 balance, I try to pay this off every month (more on that later)  


Retirement Accounts:

401(k) - ~$7,000

Rollover IRA from old 401(k) - ~$14,000

Roth IRA - ~$4,000



Situation:

A couple months ago I decided I was sick of credit debt and dedicated myself to cut down spending and knock out my credit debt.  I had roughly $20k in debt on three cards.  I decided to take out the personal loan to consolidate the debt, lower interest rate, and stop spending on the cards.  I cut up two of the cards and am using the third one to pay bills (and get the Southwest Airlines points) and pay it off every month.


The problem is that the monthly payment on the loan is more than my old minimum payments were.  While I realize that this is a GOOD thing and will result in me paying off the debt faster, I am having a bit of a hard time with it.  As you can see, the past two months I have come up a bit short on paying off the balance on my credit card and I currently have a $400 balance.  I know that isn't a large amount but the last thing I want is to have that balance grow back up.


My mortgage + auto + loan payments equal $2145 which is over half of my monthly take home pay.  Freeing some of that up would go a long way, including building up an emergency fund, which is way too small right now.



Question:

I am considering pulling $9k out of my IRA to pay off the truck.  First let me say that I take good care of it, it is in good condition and I plan to drive it until the wheels fall off so to speak.  That would free up $335/month.


That would allow me to:

1. Divert some money to my emergency fund until it is at least large enough to not be scary small.

2. Have enough to make sure to pay off the bills credit card every month.

3. Put extra money towards the personal loan payment and pay it off faster.  That is a five year loan and if I can put an extra $250 or so every month I could pay it off in about three.


I believe that the truck will last me at least three more years, and the idea of being (bad) debt free in three years sounds great to me.


Am I thinking about this right?  I know that taking money from a retirement account is generally considered a bad thing, but I need to get out of debt.  Thank you for reading and please give me any thoughts that you might have.

I've been on IBR but am tired of not even making my minimum interest amounts every month. I'm cutting back and am trying to take a more aggressive approach to the loans. 

Just for the sake of round numbers, let's say my IBR payment is $1000 and my total monthly interest accrual is $1600. Let's assume I want to pay $1800 a month towards them. I have two options:

A) Pay $1600 across the board to cover all accruing interest and apply $200 to the largest interest loan (at 8.5%) giving me a net gain of $200 a month. 

B) Pay the minimum on all loans except the 8.5% and put the rest towards the 8.5%.  Under that plan, I'm still gaining interest on 9 out of 10 loans (which is not capitalizing while in IBR) but am paying down the principle of the 8.5% at a rate of about $600 a month.  The accruing interest is $400 so my net gain is still about $200 a month. 

I ran the actual numbers last night and both scenarios resulted in the same ""net"" although applied in different ways. I know conventional wisdom is to pay the highest interest rate first, but that assumes you are making minimum interest payments on all debts I think.

personalfinance,"""Utilization has no memory/history"" is false. Please stop saying it! (US)","There is a very common saying that ""utilization has no memory/history"".  I've seen it perpetuated on other sources, and it is pervasive on Reddit.  For a very long time I've believed this saying to be false.  My main reasons for this were:

1. When I pull my credit report, I see a table with utilization/balance information for every account, going back approximately 2 years.

2. If I were a lender, I would want to use this information when evaluating a potential applicant's ability to repay me.  If they've historically had high balances, and magically now have a $0 balance, then I would want to ask that person why?  Did they come into some money?  Big tax return?  Family member helped them out?  Or did they throw everything they had at the debt and it's going to be charged right back up?

However, people have insisted that I was wrong, and that the history was only visible to ""me"".  I knew this was false.  I've worked in the automotive, telecommunications, e-commerce, and healthcare industry.  I've seen credit information and how it's used, from a technology perspective (I'm a software engineer).  I know that businesses see utilization history when they pull credit -- I've seen it, myself.

However, when I provide that information, people seem to brush it off and insist that even if lenders had access to it, they don't ""use"" it when making decisions.  Hah.  For starters, I believe that if a business has it, they're gonna use it -- right or wrong.  But how could I ""prove"" it?

Well, Geico has provided me with proof:  [GEICO Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act Disclosure Notice](http://i.imgur.com/0ik1EZ3.jpg).

To provide some background, my insurance was coming up for renewal.  I decided I would ""shop-around"" and make sure I was getting the best value.  One of the quotes that I ran was with GEICO.  They were actually less expensive than I'm currently paying, but they don't offer some of the coverages that I currently have, and I ultimately decided to stay with my current carrier.  However, about a week later, I received the (above) letter in the mail.  I have removed identifying marks, such as my name/address, as well as a few 2D barcodes; I hope you understand my desire not to give out identifying information.

Notice that the reason GIECO claims to be unable to give me their ""best"" price is due to ""Excessive utilization of bank revolving accounts in past 12 months.""  That is quite specific.  Not current utilization (which is &lt; 10%, btw) -- but utilization in the last 12 months!  It turns out I did run up a couple cards with some major purchases in 2014.  I know it's not ""in style"" in the PF sub-reddit to pay any interest, but I admit that I did float a balance for a few months, and then quickly paid it off.  It's been paid off for about 3 months.  I know that my utilization has been reporting &lt;10% through the credit bureaus.  I've seen it through Credit Karma, as well as the recovery of my FICO through Capital One, Discover, and Barclays.

So, how would GEICO even know this information unless:

1. Utilization **DOES** have a memory/history.
2. Businesses **ARE** provided this information when pulling credit.
3. Businesses **DO** use the information when making decisions.

Of course, Reddit is full of nay-sayers.  So I'm sure I'll hear excuses such as ""yea, well, GEICO is an insurance company and banks may be different.""  I suppose that's possible.  But I doubt it.  Even if that were true, it still makes the statement ""Utilization has no memory/history"" completely false.  Obviously it does have history.  And *at least* SOME users of credit information do hold it against you.  So yes -- it matters!

edit:  Another Redditor has claimed that because only the ""current"" utilization is factored into the FICO score, then the history does not matter -- even if it is reported.  This is a poor argument.  The purpose of your credit report is to get favorable terms when applying for credit, insurance, utility accounts, cell phone plans, etc.  The score is technically irrelevant.  A ""perfect"" score is useless if it does not get you favorable terms.  Likewise, a ""poor"" score is not important if you are still able to get favorable terms.  What matters is your ability to accomplish your goal.  In reality, the score is partially used for this purpose.  However, the data within your report is also used.  Some people even argue that the ""data"" matters more than the score.  And I have clearly shown that the ""data"" -- independent of score -- is used when making credit decisions.  Consequently, the data matters!

So lets do the right thing, and stop perpetuating this lie!

P.S. If you're rebuilding your credit, or you want to take an action that relies on credit information, make sure you keep your utilization ""optimal"" for at least the 12 months before application, to ensure optimal rates!",finance,1423072784

I also do not want to buy a car from Craigslist as my current car is worth fixing.

The way I see it, my only option is to go with a loan shark (or save for 4 more months which I prefer not to do).  Does anyone have any advice in dealing with these companies?  Does anyone have a company they recommend?  In the absence of my car I can save $270 a month.  If I go through with getting a loan and have my car up and working then I can save $70 a month and put it toward a payment.

I had a Perkins loan (~$18k) go into default this year. I didn't realize I wasn't making payments on it until I saw the default on my credit report and yes I realize it was a huge fuckup. (They were sending the notices to an address I lived in in college where I wasn't living anymore) That said, I'm trying to make this right without further messing things up. 

I contacted the school and they gave me the number of the debt collection agency they use. I was the one to initiate contact. The collector told me I basically have two options: I could rehabilitate the debt, or I could consolidate my federal student loans. In order to get things paid sooner and get the default off my record I said I wanted to rehab. 

The collector kept saying that it would probably be about $1000 a month for the 9 consecutive payments. When I returned with an offer of paying $750 a month she talked to her boss and got back to me the next day saying that they could do that, but only if I payed $9k upfront, and payed 750/mo for the 9 months. I told her I didn't think that was reasonable, I don't even have that kind of disposable income, and said I could probably do $2k upfront and 750/mo.

personalfinance,How (un)reasonable is using a 401k loan for a down payment?,"From a finance perspective, the money is losing interest at the 401k rate while saving it at the mortgage rate - do we agree on that?

My 401k is at .23% ROR for the last quarter and 10% for the last year. I'm assuming a roughly 4% interest rate, so depending on how my 401k performs there's actually a chance to save me some money. It would also force me to pay off a pretty substantial amount of equity early on. The downside, obviously, is that I'm pretty heavily leveraged for the first few years.

The reason I'm considering this as opposed to just saving the money is that I have good job security, fairly high income for my age and area, and a mortgage on a comparable house would be half the cost of renting it in my area. I have two reliable roommates as well. Extra cash has gone to paying off student loans, so I would incur a pretty big delay if I transition to saving now. I feel like now is the time before interest rates and prices begin to climb in earnest.

Would this be a mistake? I'm probably looking at a one year horizon to start saving as much as possible and going from there.",finance,1423076218

I'm a 26-year-old recent college graduate with student loans (mostly federal, one 'private') that I have been making regular payments towards for over a year now. Beforehand, due to inability to make certain payments, my private loan defaulted.  An issue surfaced this week with my private loan (through Wells Fargo):

While I was still in school, my father (who has since passed) co-signed and received this WF private loan, which is now in my name. The loan was originally for 18K and I know owe roughly 11K on it. This week, Wells Fargo, unbeknownst to me for several days and without forewarning, garnished roughly 3K from my checking account (I have a simple checking/savings with WF). Wells Fargo will not refund the lump sum that was removed (which is fine, I'm willing to take it as a loss and set up some sort of new payment plan). An acquaintence of mine (an account) suggests I remove my funds from these WF accounts immediately, claiming it may not be in one's best interest to 'bank with the same institution one still has owed loans through'. 

Is this sound advice? 
Has anyone encountered a similar situation?

Bitcoin,Thinking of trying to develop a Cryptocurrency MMORPG - Comments?,"See title. I came up with the idea the other day, and I believe that I could be on to something with it. Hopefully I don't post it up here just so someone else can steal the idea, but maybe it could be open source anyway.

My concept is to develop an MMORPG. I don't know what kind yet, whether medieval, modern, or futuristic. I haven't really thought of game play mechanics yet or even which engine to start with. The main concept is that the economy in the game will be totally based on cryptocurrency.

$0.25 worth of Bitcoin may only be .00125000 or so. But if you take that, trade it for LTC, than XRP, than in the end wind up with TIPS (Fedora coin) I wind up with over 21,000,000.00 TIPS. If you divide this down to the satoshi of a TIPS, $0.25 can be divisible into 210 Trillion units. A satoshi of a TIPS could be the starting ""copper pieces"" of the game. As you progress you could trade up though the different pieces going from TIPS (copper) to DOGE (bronze) to LTC (silver) to BTC (gold) and 42 (platinum). (Platinum pieces through copper pieces is an AD&amp;D reference, the exact system in the game and currencies used will probably differ in the end.)

Basically take any MMORPG, which has an economy and a currency unit. This currency in the game is probably able to be bought at a certain rate from the company that provides the games. Players sometimes find ways to sell their currency, but at a discount and against the EULA.

This game would be totally different. The currency in the game would be cryptocurrency which could be withdrawn to a qt outside of the game, and likewise players could mine their own currency or buy their currency at an exhange and transfer it into the game. You could sell your expensive gear at the NPC or player market in game, take the currency you get in the game, transfer it out of the game, and sell it at an exchange for money, all within the EULA.

This is an idea in the making, and there are already other crypto-currency based games. But think of, like, a RuneScape clone that wasn't a complete waste of time because if you became a Mega-Billionaire in the game, you could actually cash out something in real life.",cryptocurrency,1423077762

personalfinance,Going back to college - Ineligible for Federal Loans?,"I am in my late 20’s, married, childless, and currently working as an electrical designer at a consulting engineering firm. I generally enjoy my job, and I feel like I am compensated well for someone with an AS degree and approx. 4 years of experience (roughly $50K gross).  I do the exact same work that a junior engineer at my company would (arc flash studies, lighting design, distribution design, etc.). I would however like to finish an engineering degree and have been taking night classes for a while in preparation of going back to school fulltime.
 Up until this point I haven’t really used student loans; all of my classes have been paid for out of pocket or as through my time in the National Guard with the exception of 12 credit hours or so. I am no longer in the military and don’t have enough savings to pay for a few years of university so I will have to use loans if I were to go back fulltime. My wife is science teacher at a small public school and makes enough to almost cover our living expenses, but certainly not enough to pay for tuition and books.
In researching federal student loans I came across a big stumbling block; minimum pace of progression guidelines. Apparently there is a 150% credit cap for federal student loans. I currently have 98 credits at the CC that I am attending part time; 63 are part of my AS degree, 23 will likely transfer to the university, and 12 are from a semester where I withdrew from all of my classes. Unfortunately, I also have approximately 36 attempted credits from another college. After HS I messed around for a while and ultimately accumulated a few semesters worth of withdraws and F's.
The BS degree that I wish to pursue is 128 credits hours, which would mean that I have 195 credits to complete the degree as per the 150% guidelines. Since I have approximately 128 total attempted credits so far, that would leave me with just 64 credits to finish the degree. I obviously will not be able to earn a BS with just 64 additional credits.  
To be frank, I am afraid that I may already be ineligible for federal student loans. I read that if it is mathematically impossible to finish a degree within 150% of the published credits a student is not eligible for aid. 
I contacted my school’s financial aid department about this and they have yet to respond to me, but from what I am gathering private student loans might be my only choice at this point. I just can’t shake the feeling that paying for 3 or so years of school with private loans is a bad idea. What would happen if I was two years in and couldn’t get a loan for the third for instance. Not to mention the terrible loans rates and lax regulation. The internet is filled with private loan horror stories. 
I have a good job and I make decent money, but honestly I would like to have the engineering degree for the added respect and security it would bring, but I won’t do it if it doesn’t make fiscal sense.

personalfinance,"Looking for advice on HSA, rolling IRAs over, switching custodians, appropriate allocations..and taxes!","I'm 32, currently have 9K in a traditional IRA through my CU which offers no investment vehicles.  I also have 3,500 in a HSA at a local bank from a previous employer, this bank also offers no investment vehicles and the HSA is currently losing money based on the annual maintenance fee vs. interest rate.  I want to transfer custodians for both accounts, but am having a really hard time figuring out the best way to do it, and how I would allocate the investments after doing so.


As far as the IRA, I was planning on transferring it to Vanguard and rolling it over to a Roth.  I guess the question is why?  I'll have to pay taxes on the rollover, I currently make 32k a year, and 9K would put me into the next tax bracket so I'd have to pay 25% on it instead of 15%, is this correct?  If so should I do a partial rollover to keep me under the next marginal bracket, and do the remainder next year?  And is this all moot depending on what funds I use them for?  For instance, my goal is the lazy 3 fund allocation of Total Stock VTSMX, Total International Stock VGTSX, and Total Bond VBMFX, but I don't yet have a taxable account with Vanguard, so I was thinking of buying a share of each (@ 3k) with the IRA money (+difference if taxed on roth rollover), then starting a taxable account and buying another 3k of TSM VTSMX.  The ratio is wonky, but I could adjust as more funds become available and at least I would have broad exposure.  OR would it be a better idea to bump the IRA up to 10K and buy an admiral share of the Total Bond VBMFX for tax efficiency purposes, then buy TSM &amp; TISM in a taxable account as I can?  


For the HSA I want to transfer my HSA to [Health Savings Administrators](http://healthsavings.com/).  They have a higher annual fee ($45 vs. $20 at current bank), however the fee can be paid by a 3rd party and they offer Vanguard mutual funds.  I am on a health plan through my current employer, so from what I understand I can't contribute to this HSA, although I can liquidate as needed to offset any future health costs and at least it's doing something (hopefully) other than dying a slow death.

personalfinance,"Foreign (UK) Student Loans, Forex and Fun!","Hey PF! Recently wed a lovely girl from across the pond. She's moved here and landed an gig with a wonderful company here in the USA. We have a bit of a strange student loan conundrum.

Now that she's working again she's tasked by the UK government to pay off her UK government-issued student loans to the tune of 9% of her income per year over a base income of £16,910.

Her debt is not insurmountable at about £17,000 (~$26,000). And currently rings up interest at 1.5%. 

If the loan were in the US, and we received a tax deduction for interest, she'd more than gladly pay the absolute minimum on this loan through it's life with the expectations of long-term higher returns in many other investment vehicles. But the fact that the loan is in pounds and we receive no tax benefits means we're wondering whether it might make more sense to pay it all off ASAP.

Foreign currency exchange issues play a large part of this. Due to the drop in the pound-dollar exchange rate, the loan is at the lowest value in dollars it's been since 2010. Obviously it could dip more but it could also increase as well. I'm hesitant to play the currency markets but I'd love to take advantage of the low cost now as we have the cash on hand and both live frugally (have fully funded emergency funds, both contribute 100% to 401k's and IRA's and have no other debts) and any major purchases are long down the road. We're just enjoying our DINK status and saving as much as we can now.  

The question is, is paying off such a loan crazy with the low an interest rate? I know many others (President Obama being a good example, carry student loans for years only making minimum payments.) In this case my wife doesn't have to pay anything if she stops working but obviously will consistently have interest building up through the life of the loan until the 25th anniversary of the loan when it is currenctly scheduled to be written off. She plans on working for the forseeable future and if exchange rates stay steady and we only paid the minimum the UK required per year she'd pay the entirety off in 4 years with minimal (&lt;£500) accumulated interest. That being said, any wild swings in currency markets could increase or decrease that up to 2x.

My next question is what to go with below:

Table loan
Each payment you make is the same (although if you’re on a variable interest rate, your interest payment will change with the market). With each instalment the proportion of principal paid back gradually increases as the interest paid back decreases.

Instalment loan
Paying the same amount of principal back with every repayment reduces your interest payments a little every time (depending on changes to interest rates).

Revolving Credit
You can opt for a revolving credit facility as part of your Home Loan (limits apply). Direct credit your salary and as your debt reduces, you can draw funds again.

Once interest starts accruing on some of the newer ones, my balance on each will increase, and as such, minimum payments won't effect the balance on some of them, with most only denting it for about 6-8 months a year (I did the math, I think. For those of you who are savvy, some more numbers here would be useful.)

The majority of these loans are at 6.8%, a mixture of unsubsidized, subsidized, Stafford, and Perkins loans. I've gone to unburyme, done all of that as well. Here's a brief detail of the balances BEFORE factoring in my last quarter in my program (about another 6K):

Group/  Balance/   Interest Rate/  Minimum Payment/

J/         21,731/     5.41 /             80 (I will increase to 110)/

K/        13,869/     6.21/              84/

I/         8,559 /      6.8  /             92/

D/       8,077/       6.8   /            135/

B/        6,409/       6.8   /            70/

H1/      5500/        3.4 (IR Expected to double)/ 110/

H2/      5500 /       3.4 (IR Expected to double)/  110/

D2/      4,466/       6.8   /            135/

G/        4,030/       6.8  /             44/

C/        4,500 /      4.5 (IR May increase, but not sure)/  47/

A/        3,500 /      5.6 /              38/

E/        1,692 /      6.8 /              18/

F/        675 /         4.5 (IR May increase, but not sure)/  7/


Total monthly payments: Roughly 965, likely to increase to about 1050 after final quarter.

So as you can see, there's a decent variety in the balances I've built up here. The ones with more 'detailed' numerical values have been building up some interest over time. 

My lifestyle:
I'm about as close as you can get to being a hippy/buddhist/frugal king. If not for my entertainment expenses (a beer, some games every once in a while), my cost of living would be about 800 bucks a month, rent included. I eat cheap, don't own a vehicle, a phone, TV, etc. I don't buy new things, I replace old things. I spend a little extra and make a t-shirt last 6-7 years. Most of my belongings are 7-8 years old, very little signs of wear, since I take care of my stuff. I have a computer, and the internet, and it's all I need. No insurance, but I've never gotten very sick (although I'll be getting on the healthcare.gov site this weekend to sign up for the 18/month package). I have a very small balance on a credit card that I make monthly payments on, and that will be knocked out by the time I graduate(about 500 bucks). I live a quiet life, and I write, and that's enough for me. I learned lessons in the years when I received much less aid than I needed, such as how to cook and live cheap, how to budget, etc. 

Monthly expenses:

Rent/utilities/monthly bills: 550 dollars

Food/entertainment/random: 250-450 dollars (in case I need new clothes, etc)

My current plan is to look for work that will start me at roughly 30K a year. I have a good background in editing, leadership, teaching, and other areas. I am also very intelligent, and willing to work outside my immediate realm as long as there's a lot I can learn from the job. At that amount, I'd be fine living as I am for a while (5-10 years), and putting roughly 2/3rds of my salary toward my debt, utilizing the snowball method to remove some low balance loans to reduce minimums and simplify, while also using avalanche to target several high interest, medium balance loans, such as H1/H2. I can expect a certain amount of tax from my state (about 8%) on my income, etc. 

I suppose what I'm looking for here is some advice on both how to approach handling this much debt, what I can expect out of life for the next few years (I can still get coffee, right?) and whether my idea of paying roughly 20K toward loans is a good idea. Also, this is the low range for jobs I am looking at. Things such as being a paralegal assistant, a job I'm very interested in, pay a higher salary. I'm most qualified to teach, and Idaho (Next door) starts teachers at roughly 30K. Also, the city I live in is very cheap to live in, and my state has one of the highest minimum wages (Washington). I also know that I can't just pay the minimums and expect to dent the principle balances in any time, such as the 21,000 balance, which would actually increase. 

Am I crazy to think I can live off 10K a year? Do I need a wake-up call here, despite my immensely frugal lifestyle? For those of you in similar situations, are you happy? Do you still get to go out often enough, and live a decent life? Should I consider an income based repayment plan, or possibly working in a public service job and simply paying minimums for 10 years?

In the mean time, I'm looking for part-time work in my city that I can use to pay down a bit of the debt. I'm also delaying my graduation by several months to increase the deferral period and give me some capital so I can move for a job if needed. I'll be taking one 500 dollar summer course to do so, but it only lasts a week, and I will finish ALL my studies in mid-late June of this year. It's a unique course, offered only once every two years. Consider this non-negotiable (and I'm aware of what it tacks on). 

I'll be around, so any advice is appreciated (everything from working public service, to job offers). Open to answer any and all questions (within reason). Thanks guys!",finance,1423086782

personalfinance,Do I need to file an amended state return if I filed an amended federal return but my state tax liability did not change,"Hi all,

I am going to be amending my federal return because I received a 1099-DIV I wasn't expecting (although due to me paying foreign taxes and the dividend being so low it's actually going to increase my federal refund by a whole $2!)

I have noticed no change in my state tax liability when I start filling NC's D-400X. Do I need to still file the D-400X? I've looked at the [Department of Revenue site](http://dornc.com) and it only seems to say that if you were owed a state refund due to a change in your federal return [you must file the amendment within 6 months of the DoR receiving a notification from the IRS](http://www.dornc.com/taxes/individual/amend.html). (I assume you also have to amend if you now owe the state money due to the change:))

**VIEWPOINT:**

* Can nuclear succeed in liberalized power markets?

There are 69 reactors under construction today - the largest number in 25 years - but only one is in a liberalized electricity market, writes Edward Kee.

The electricity industry has two competing models: A traditional model with vertically integrated monopolies subject to economic regulation or government ownership; and a new model with a de-integrated and restructured electricity industry and a liberalized electricity market. These are based on very different economic principles.

All operating nuclear power plants were built under the traditional model. Almost all nuclear power plants under construction today are in systems using the traditional model, including countries with government-owned utilities such as China, India, South Korea, and the UAE. Are liberalized electricity markets incompatible with nuclear power?

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or put money in 401k?,"I recently graduated from university and am looking for advice on where to put my money. I currently have about 30k in student loan debt, but my employer offers 401k matching and I am trying to figure out what would be the most effective way to use my money. My financial situation is the following:

* Salary: 110,000 annual + ~15% bonus, receiving about ~20k in first paycheck after taxes (from signing bonus, relocation bonus, etc.)
* Debt: 30k at ~5% interest rate (varies between accounts, but is mostly around 5%) and payments are not required until December 2015
* 401k: 50% employer matching up to maximum contribution ($9,000 per year from employer)

Now from a high level it looks like I should just max out my 401k. That's an immediate 50% return on my money. However, it doesn't sit right that I'll have this 30k in student loan debt sitting there and I'd like to get rid of that ASAP. What I think I'm planning on doing is taking the bonuses from my first paycheck to max out a 401k and then starting to pay down my student loan debt early, but I don't know if this is the most effective thing to do. I could alternatively put my first paycheck directly towards student loans such that computed interest will be slower, then just put the appropriate amount of money from each paycheck into my 401k such that it maxes out. What are people's opinions on this?",finance,1423093966
personalfinance,Paying off student loans or using graduate school loan deferment?,"Hello all, I'm going to be entering graduate school next year and had some questions about what /r/personalfinance thinks I should do in terms of repaying my student loans.

The program itself is a biomedical PhD program at highly-ranked university in Chicago. It tends to offer pretty reasonable stability and outcome compared to many others (90% retention/graduation rate, average completion in 5.75 years, financial support for the entirety of the degree).

The financial support I'll be receiving for the year is equal to  roughly $2166/month after taxes (3.75% Illinois state income tax, and using 2015 rates for federal taxes) without claiming any deductions. This comes in addition health insurance and dental insurance.

I currently have quite large student loans (only semi-regretting my choice of college..):

-$7000 Perkins loan at 5% interest

-$19,201 Direct subsidized loans at avg 3.7% interest

-$24,857 Direct unsubsidized loans at 5.9% (the part I regret)

**For a total of $51,000 at an average rate of 4.9%** or about $510/month

My other expenses *currently* are:

-Splitting a 1br apartment with partner of 5 years: $450, including all bills
-$18.99/month for phone

-Food, which via eating out with friends doubles as about 98% of my entertainment as well: ~300-400/month? Just ball-parking this, because I don't really know. It's definitely been my biggest splurge-source, historically.

-Transportation ~400/year

-The remainder of my spending on personal items/entertainment is pretty low, but I couldn't really say. I may spend $50/year on stuff like movies or shows or very rarely, video games. $200/year on eye exams + eyewear (I don't think this is covered by my insurance) I don't really know what I spend on person items like toothpaste, soap, etc...

So my expenses per month are currently maybe ~$800-900 give or take a bit?

By my math I could definitely afford my student loan repayments, even if my math is low (maybe 1500/month as a higher estimate for loan payments), with around $600 left over to save/for emergencies/or other expenses like Christmas gifts and what-have-you. Even if I defer my loans it was my plan to pay off my interest since that is apparently allowed and tax deductible.

My current apartment is also slightly inconveniently located, and getting another apartment in a better position would entail a rent increase of something like $100-250 per month. I'd ideally be able to do this, but I could absolutely make it work without moving. It'd just be a little bit of a bitch. So if I wanted to do that it would further limit how much I have left over and push it closer to paycheck-to-paycheck territory.

Moreover, I will be going into the program with no substantial savings.  I grew up in a family of four with similar income to what I'm now personally earning (and an layed-off single mother living off SNAP/TANF/unemployment for my last year and a half of high school), and lack a good example of financial planing.

Do I have enough with $600/month to save *anything* meaningful towards retirement? I will probably be 30 by the time I finish this program and I'm worried about finishing off loan repayments in my 30s and not having started saving anything for the future yet. The income I'd be earning is FICA/Medicare exempt which means I won't be earning anything towards social security either, no? Should I be worried about that?

There's also a good chance if the public service based loan forgiveness program still exists when I am finishing that I will be able to qualify for that. One of my my mentors who finished their PhD a few years back has qualified and has calculated that they'll end up getting about a quarter of the loan amount cut off because of it. I don't think I qualify for this during my graduate research assistant, though, because I my primary classification is as a ""student"" as opposed to a ""worker.""

What do you think I should do? One other option I had been considering was paying off my interest, saving what would otherwise be my student loan payments for emergencies and whatnot over the next several years and then using whatever I have saved up sometime after graduating as a larger payment toward my loans.

What do you think?",finance,1423095108
personalfinance,What do I do with 30 grand in college savings? Is a regular savings account really the best route?,"Feel free to just read the first background paragraph and the ""the issue is this"" one, if you just want the basics.

**Background:** I (F/21) have one more year left until I graduate with a BS in behavioral science, which granted, is not the most useful degree. I got my associates as a small local college, and am now finishing the BS at an affordable local university. Eventually, I intend to get my Ph.D in psychology and work as a clinician. My grandparents started a savings account to pay for my college education when I was very young, and in 2010 the money was transferred to my name and we placed it in a 5 year CD at a 2.47% interest rate.

I started college in 2011 and have managed to avoid pulling out any money or accruing any debt through a combination of working, delaying semester to save up, borrowing small amounts from my parents, and a monthly stipend I receive from the VA (DEA: dependent's educational assistance bill, because my father is a disabled vet). 

I will be able to graduate with my Bachelors without any debt, for which I am eternally grateful. Unfortunately, I think it's unlikely that I will be able to say the same about my Ph.D, because the tuition for a major and likely out of state university will far outstrip the set stipend I receive from the VA.  I don't know where I am going yet, but it will probably be expensive.


**The issue is this**: my CD expires this June, and I will lose the good interest rate. Renewing the account at Wells Fargo would only get me something like a 0.5% interest, and if I had to withdraw money for tuition I would probably lose money overall. The guy I spoke to today at the bank suggested putting it in a regular savings account to avoid penalties, and the FAQ mentioned keeping college savings there as well... but leaving over 30 grand languishing in a regular savings account sounds odd to me. Is that really the best option?

I don't know if there are any somewhat safe ways to invest this money which would allow me to liquify if needed in a few years time. I don't know if it would be worth it to look into something riskier but with a higher rate of return. Do I just invest it long term? I don't know a whole lot about investing, but I'm under the impression that, short of investing it in the stock market, I would not receive enough back in interest to justify taking out student loans--ergo, I should spend this money before looking into loans when I get to grad school.

I'm looking for some advice about where to go from here, whether and how I should invest it, or how I should utilize it to pay for grad school, etc. General advice is more than welcome as well. I'm fortunate in that I don't feel strapped for cash or desperate, but I would like to be in a good place in the future as well.

1. after we are married, should we file taxes jointly or separately? I am thinking most likely jointly, as it will mean we probably give a bit less to the fed.
2. If jointly, then now I (we) can no longer contribute to the roth IRA that I have going. I have been trying to figure this out, but can I still contribute to a traditional IRA or is there AGI limits for traditional IRA contributions too?
3. If I can still contribute to traditional IRA, is it possible to change my roth IRA into a traditional, and then continue contributing to it? Or are there better options here? 

I am not trying to complain, but I really love how simple my situation is right now: I have a 401k and roth IRA, things are easy from an investment strategy standpoint.

___

I'm expecting anywhere from 40-60k from my VA educational benefit housing backpay. The giant variation is because I don't know how many months they'll actually count as me being in school, since I'm in trade school and OJT. However, minimum is going to be 40k. They're about three years behind on my benefits. And honestly, whether it is 40ish or more, it'll still be more than I've brought in while working. If it's around 60-70, it'll equal what I brought home the last two years, total. 

I want to use this in the best way possible. 

Current plan:

* pay 8k down on my car, negotiate a better interest rate. I had to buy it with very little down, right after draining my emergency funds due to medical things. 

* pay off my CC 

* pay off my loan

* put money into savings

* add to my retirement somehow. Possibly max out this year's contribution?

* look into investing

* add money to my rainy day fund

* add money to my everyday savings/checking accounts.

---|---
put money down on principle of car, negotiate better interest | -8,000

personalfinance,I've run into an issue,"I'm not sure if anyone here can do anything, but I sure hope they can.

My problem is described in basic terms because I'm not to skilled either


I have an account with Fidelity, a brokerage company. Basically I use this to put money into my retirement and not pay tax on it. If I set aside money in that account for retirement, then I no longer need to pay tax on that portion of my income. 

In December of 2014, I spoke to a customer rep and he told me that my setup was all good that I would set aside roughly 20,000 USD, and that it would be all good.


I sent a check to deposit the money a week ago, and it came back saying that my account had been closed. They told me originally that I could send my check even by April. 

This came as a shock, as I didn't receive any notification and I didn't have insufficient funds or anything.

Basically, now Im going to lose around 8000 dollars in state and federal taxes combined on that 20,000.

I called the company and they told me there's nothing that can be done because my account has been wiped from their system. Basically, they just said sorry and that there's nothing they can do.

I talked to supervisor after supervisor, but they all said the same thing.

Bitcoin,AMA Request: US-based Bitcoin company KYC/AML Analyst or Compliance Officer (or executive),"I am curious if there is a KYC/AML Analyst or Compliance Officer (or executive) from any US based exchange (or exchange type company) willing to field some questions on /r/bitcoin. 

Customers want to easily acquire bitcoin anonymously, but regulation prohibits any fishy business around fiat money anywhere. Exchanges' customer support has been pretty stripped down and corporate from my experience. They generally do not complain or commiserate about putting customers through the pain/annoyance of identity verification. While it is a good PR move, I can imagine the bitcoin fanatics/founders in the company being rubbed the wrong way as well. 

People complain here regularly about experiences they have had with exchanges and identity verification troubles. It would be great to hear the other side of the story, from real humans. 

To Start:

1. ELI5 the KYC basics you need to execute as a company to comply.
2. What are the frustrations bitcoin exchanges/companies deal besides the obvious customer dissatisfactions? 
3. What would you change if you could? 
4. What are the repercussions of not complying well enough to KYC/AML laws.
5. Where does pressure come from, the banks or the government? What kind of pressure?

personalfinance,[Advice] First time home buyer (24) debating large down payments vs large emergency fund.,"Hi all, I'm just going to jump straight into details here, and I'll be reading responses in the morning.

**Me:** 24 years old, married, 2 kids.

**Emergency Fund:** We've determined this amount needs to be about $12K to get us through 6 months worth of life, and for us to be secure. It sits untouched in a liquid savings account.

**Funds:** Checking / Savings accounts currently sitting at an additional $22K.

**Home:** $65,500, could use about $10K of renovations after purchase.

**Credit Score:** (760-780)

**Debt:** None. We own our 2 vehicles, we have our monthly bills, but no other debt what-so-ever.

**Salary:** $35-40K / year. We have constructed our bills as such that we put $500-750 in the ""Emergency Fund"" every month, so we live well within our means.

I can post more details if need be.

The loan amount is $65,500 with no down payment (and it is a VA loan, so down payment is entirely optional). Interest rate is locked 3.5% for 15 years meaning that our payments will be between $400-450 depending on our down payment. 

We are pretty set on the $10K worth of renovations in the house as it is a cosmetic train wreck, but structurally sound. 

So my options:

* Down Payment

If I put 10% down I avoid $1,400 in Funding Fees from the VA, and I also save myself an additional $2,500 (roughly) of interest over the life of the loan. I have instant equity in the home, and we get the opportunity to pay it off sooner (a goal of ours, since this is not the ""dream home""). The problem is with the total closing costs and down payments coming to just under $10K, plus the additional $10K in renovations once we move in, we are only left with $2K in the checking and our $12K emergency fund (I know right, poor pitiful me...). Is it generally advised to cut your self so close to the red line of dipping into your Emergency Fund? Our regular paychecks obviously support us fine, and withholding any major life event we would not come close to using the Emergency fund, but life *is* unpredictable.

* No Down Payment

I can close on the house and still have about $24K in liquid assets at the ready after the $10K in renovations are completed. It means I have to pay the $1400 Funding fee, as well as about $2500 extra interest over the life of the loan, but it also means I can re-invest all of the capital I've been pooling.

What says /r/personalfinance on the matter?

**TL;DR:** Finance $65,500 on a home at 3.5% with no money down, incur a $1,400 funding fee, then invest $10,000; or finance $55,500 at the same interest rate after putting $10,000 down and avoiding the $1,400 fee.",finance,1423107493

My income was very inconsistent throughout college and sure enough, some point along the road I became unable to make the entire payment, I would pay as much as I could from my checking account each month, but since there wouldn't be anything leftover after that I would keep needing to use the card. I know this is not how credit should be used and in retrospect it was very stupid of me. I have since saved up enough money to stop using the credit card completely, and am making smaller monthly payments to bring down the balance over time.

financialindependence,Anyone can pick up this side hustle - AMA about mystery shopping,"Whenever I see people mention their side hustles on reddit, they're usually hard to get into or pretty time intensive - doing taxes for others, flipping items on craigslist, waiting tables after work, etc.

Mystery/secret shopping allows you to choose your own hours and jobs and do as much or as little as you'd like. There are plenty of things that are compatible with a 9-5 work schedule. The pay is not great but it's not terrible for the time investment, and you get lots of free stuff - free stuff you would often be buying anyways, like groceries, meals, car oil changes, gas, beer, etc.

Does it sound too good to be true? It definitely felt like it at first, but it's legit. It's not for everyone, it's location-dependent (some areas have tons of shops, some have none - more or less competition for jobs depending on area as well), and there are of course a few downsides.

The pay is delayed, so you are paying up-front for the cost of whatever items you buy, and are reimbursed later. This is not the job for people on the razor's edge of their pocketbook. Sometimes it can take over two months to receive your check, and although I haven't gotten stiffed, I have heard of people having to chase down checks, so meticulous records keeping is recommended, just in case. If you do a large amount of shops, you could be floating literally hundreds of dollars to these companies until the checks start rolling in. Of course, it's up to you how many jobs you take on and what the costs are - it's totally possible to stick to shops do not require any purchase and so no floating is required.

Additionally, if you fuck up the shop and it gets rejected - and this will happen sooner or later especially when you're new - you will not be paid OR reimbursed. You need to be able to pay great attention to detail and follow directions correctly and discreetly, and record everything, which can take some getting used to. The data entry can be boring and time-consuming, and some jobs' time-to-pay ratio kinda sucks.

One more thing - you might get fat. Seriously, so much free food, I've had pizza like three times this week. Maybe I should do that gym membership shop ;)

To qualify you need excellent written communication skills, observational skills, ability to interact with employees in sometimes scripted ways while seeming natural and it really helps to be the type who can figure things out on their own. But it's worth it -  I've earned over $350 since I started doing this in December while receiving food and items worth about $800, though I've overspent on food (ie spent $50 on meals they only reimburse $40) and had a few reports rejected which cuts into my real in-the-pocket earnings. But my grocery and dining bills have been decimated and I've gotten many things for free that I would have otherwise had to pay for anyway. In total, I have about $500-600 more in my pocket than I would have if I didn't mystery shop and maintained my previous budgets and habits (or I will be once I'm all paid up).

You should NEVER have to pay up front to secret shop, and anything asking you to do so is a scam. Finding jobs is pretty damn easy, depending on your area.

To get started, head here and look for jobs in your area. http://mysteryshop.org/jobboard/jobsearch.aspx

You'll have to sign up, and some sites require a SSN for tax purposes - if you're nervous about that you can find places that don't ask for it, but I have not run into any shop companies that aren't legit so far, and I'm signed up with dozens of them.

personalfinance,"UK, 30 year old looking for a little advice for future planning","I think I am generally in a pretty decent position financially; but having recently turned 30, I wanted to put a little more conscious effort into budgeting and future planning.

As I am from the UK, a lot of the wiki articles don’t really apply, so I wanted some suggestions of what a good situation looks like.

* House worth £200,000-220,000 (~40% equity, 23 years of mortgage term)

* Contributing to company stakeholder pension (currently at a low rate, probably something that needs to change)

* ~£4,000 in shares

* Contributing to company share option scheme (discounted share purchase over time)

* Living on budget gives leaves me up to £300 pcm to save (budget allows a decent number of nights out and fun, I could save considerably more if I was actually trying)

* No real cash reserves (definitely my weakest aspect, I need to be on budget more to create a rainy day fund before anything else)

* £8,000 in student loans, being paid off automatically each month (I don’t see the need to overpay and clear this as the interest rate is very low)

* No credit card or personal debut

As it stands I have done a budget which is pretty fair, but I spend most of the £300 on just stuff and things. A classic case of money just disappearing when you aren’t actively thinking about it.

So obviously I need to get at least a few thousand pounds in savings account just in case the washing machine explodes or whatever. But how much would people suggest I hold?

Secondly, once I have a decent amount of in hand cash, where should I put my money next? The main options I see are:

* Voluntary overpayments on the mortgage, increase the equity, get the term down, and reduce the overall interest paid. This pushes me closer to being mortgage free and cuts the overall cost of mortgage.

* Take advantage of the tax free saving options (ISA). Ideally I would want to be maxing this out, but I am not able to save that much money. The return seems good (2-4%, my mortgage is 2.59%), so technically I would be earning the around the same/more, and have more semi-available cash. 

* High interest, long term savings account. This will get rates near/better than an ISA, but loses the tax free status and become quite fixed. Doesn’t seem a great option.

* Max out my company pension contribution. It will reduce the amount I am able to save, and I will lose some flexibility as the money will never get to me (could be considered a good thing), but it will reduce my tax slightly. 

So which would be the best option? I am tempted to go with a standing order into an ISA account (amount TBD) and then over pay the mortgage every time I have a little spare money.

personalfinance,Wells Fargo's policy changes to student loan payments,"Last year, I began making the dreaded payments to my student loans. I have been more than on-top of my payments--I pay my federal loans my first paycheck of the month and pay my private loans my second paycheck of the month (paid bi-weekly). The dates on my payments may vary by a few days each month, but they're always within the same week. My loans are always paid off about 3 weeks in advance.

So, in December, I get an email stating that Wells Fargo is changing its policies about ""paying early""--meaning that if you pay before your statement becomes available then it does not count toward your next due date; it just gets added as an extra payment and your next due date stays the same.

I receive my second paycheck of the month and immediately make my private loan payment to Wells Fargo of $758--awful, I know. It's just a habit at this point, I was not thinking about the changes that WF made. This is where everything screws up. I get an email about a week later saying my loan payment is due Feb. 11. Uh, what? So I log onto my account, see my payment has been posted, but my due date hasn't changed. I PAYED MY LOAN TWO HOURS BEFORE MY STATEMENT WAS AVAILABLE. TWO HOURS. I had a 45 minute long phone call with WF and this is what I had to do: Get a letter from my bank stating that the funds have cleared and will not be returned, have them fax it to me, fax this letter to Wells Fargo and my money will be returned to me in 3-5 business days. This was Jan. 28. They told me it would be directly deposited back into my checking account. Since today is day 5 and no funds are showing in my checking account, I decide to give WF a call to see what's going on. They MAILED my check yesterday. MAILED IT. So now, if the check doesn't come in time, I will be late on my payment for the first time ever because I was being a responsible person and paid my loan two hours too early. If it was a reasonable payment, like $200-$300, I wouldn't have a problem just submitting another payment, but $758 is a different story. That's not chump change. One of their employees told me I could just submit another payment and I laughed at them and said, ""Yeah, because a college student that's just getting on their feet has an extra $758 to spend on their already fund-draining student loan."" 

Sorry for my rant, but I needed to get out my frustrations. Any advice on different banks to deal with is appreciated--I've had nothing but problems with them since I started my repayment period.

tl;dr: Made payment 2 hours early, didn't count toward by next due date and may result in me being late on my payment due the 11th.",finance,1423148727

personalfinance,Hypothetical situation: Roth v Traditional 401(k) tax implications,"Let's take a look at tax implications of retirement account contributions in relation to wages earned in different states. 

Assumptions: 

Married/Filing Jointly, gross income: 100k (50k each), typical wage increase of 2-3% per year

The couple lives in a state without a state income tax for 10 years, then moves to a state with state income tax permanently.  

Nothing about the couples household income will change with their move. They will continue to earn what they previously earned with yearly increases like before. 

No debt, no kids. Try to keep ceteris paribus as best we can. 

Both people are 25 years old

Assuming no radical tax changes on the federal or state level and a typical year-to-year inflation schedule. (Big assumptions but let's keep it easy and if people want to flesh it out more with different scenarios, go ahead). 


Ok. So let's say both people have contributed to their separate 401(k)'s up to their employers' match (typical match of: 100% of first 3% and 50% of next 3%).  They have extra money to contribute at years end. 

Do they contribute to Roth or 401(k) for the next 10 years they live in the 'non-state income' State? Would it even make a difference? 

My thought is if you don't have a state income tax and anticipate having one in 10 years, you should contribute any extra funds to your Roth. With equivalent wages in each state, your pay is worth more in the first 10 years, so you should put that in a tax free environment. Otherwise it is taxed in retirement when you move to a' state-income' state.

personalfinance,Pay off $2000 student loan or put $2000 towards car debt,"I have $2000 left on a 4.5% student loan (one of my student loans) and I have been paying on this for at least the last 7 years while in school as the original balance was $7000. I have paid a lot of interest over the years.

Lately I have been paying $250/mth to knock it down quicker (min was around 55-75).

I also owe $16k on a car loan at a bad finance rate of 8.5% (no credit at the time).

My plan is to payoff the student loan with $2000 today, and then add $834/mth that had been going to emergency fund, plus the $250 that was going to the school loan to my $433 car payment and have the car done by November(ish) this year.

personalfinance,Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Confidence or Concern?,"**The Breakdown**

Income : Collectively my wife and I make just north of $100,000 annually (her $40,000, me $60,000).  We both have 401Ks and health insurance with our employers.  For our taxes we both file as ""married filed separately"" (more on that in a second).

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Debt : We have a mortgage but I am the only name on the loan.  The loan amount is $170,000ish, thank you ""middle-of-nowhere Georgia"" for that.  We just paid off my student loan debt ($5000) and we're working towards paying off my car loan ($8000) which should be accomplished by June.  After that our only other debt is my wife's student loan debt which amounts to $140,000 in federal loans (the subject of this post).

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Savings : Apart from our 401Ks, we currently save about $1500 a month, all which is currently going towards paying off the car.  With the car loan amount, $250 a month, we are able to put $1750 a month into paying off that loan.  Once that loan is complete, we plan on increasing our 401K contributions (in addition to starting a Roth IRA) so we estimate our monthly savings to be around $1000.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**The Concern...**

My wife is currently a public defender, her dream job (whole different topic right there).  She is 14 months into her enrollment in the pubic service loan forgiveness program.  She pays $200 a month towards her loan, and after a total of 120 months the remaining balance should be forgiven.  Her job doesn't get raises, and she will likely only receive one promotion, and even then will only make just north of $50,000.  Without the PSLF our monthly payments would be approximately $1400-$1800 a month, reducing only if we extended her repayment plan to 25 years (kill me now if we decide ever to do that).

&amp;nbsp;

Financially planning around this is a nightmare.  All of our finances must stay separate, if we file jointly her monthly payments increase to $900, leaving us with virtually no savings.  On top of that the looming cloud over our heads is the government dramatically changing the plan.  Granted, *we've been told that there will always be a grandfather clause that she will fall into since she's already enrolled*.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**The Question**

How we currently have mapped out the next ten years is simple: continue to file taxes separately, pay the $200 a month for the next 100 months, and focus on saving money and paying down the mortgage.  We also plan to save up around $20,000 just in case ""shit hits the fan"", they change the program, and my wife has to seek employment in the private sector in order to pay her loan.

&amp;nbsp;

What do you guys think?  If the PSLF never changes for us, 9 years from now we'll be set.  But I don't trust the government, who does, and I'm afraid at some point we'll get notice that, ""Hey, you're screwed, now you're paying that full amount back.""  My wife fully intends to work in the public sector for a long time.  I just don't know what the best approach should be.  Do we attack this loan and put the mortgage to the backburner, even if the program never changes for us?  Do we save a lot up on the side just in case?  Or do we increase our investments and come out of this, nine years from now, debt free with our house paid off?

personalfinance,Defaulting or consolidating on credit card debt?,"Like a lot of people, I made some bad decisions with credit cards in my younger days. I have 2 high balance/high interest rate credit cards that I cannot see myself paying off in my current situation as I financially just cannot afford to pay much more than the minimum monthly payment. One card has a $7000+ balance on it with a minimum payment of $140 and I pay $150. Even that extra $10 is a stretch for me. I see no way I'd ever pay that off completely. Between my two high balance cards and the other debt I have, I'm looking at just over $15,000 of debt I'm trying to pay off.

I've researched debt consolidation, but don't think I could get a consolidation loan for what I need it for with my low credit score. In my research, I've come across a few old Reddit posts suggesting to default on the payments. After a few months, the debt collectors will start calling, and eventually my debt will be sold down to collection agencies where I may be able to settle for cents on the dollar. Is this viable, even if not completely ideal? I mean, my credit score is already shot, but if I can default here, save up and eventually pay it off to a collector in 12-18 months from now on a much cheaper amount, then be good for another 2-3 years, my credit score would rebound, correct?

I'm just starting to get desperate to get rid of this debt and looking for any possible solutions, even if I have to take a hit for a few years. Thoughts or suggestions?",finance,1423154908

Gross pay: $45k

Standard DC deduction plus one exemption: $5875

Taxable income: $39125

Using the 2014 tax table in the D40 tax forms, my tax is: $2148

Verified with marginal tax rates: (.04 x 10,000) + (.06 x 29124) = 2147.44

Questions:

1. Gross pay is with all the federal withholdings (SS, Medicare, etc.) and pretax deductions (401k, etc.) *included*, correct?

2. Because I used '14 tax info, should I expect these rates to shift when I file my taxes in '15?

3. The best way to make up the difference in what my employer is withholding ($60/check) is to redo my W-4 and ask for an additional amount to be withheld with each paycheck, right? My math indicates that I'll need to append an extra $29.50 to a 24-paycheck pay cycle to make up the difference, if $2148 breaks down to 89.50/paycheck.

I don’t think my situation is all that bad, and I think I’m on the right track, but I’m just wondering if there’s anything I’m doing wrong or not doing that I should be doing. Here’s how it looks:  

•	Monthly salary: $1,880 after taxes

•	National Student Loan debt: $32k at 5.35 per cent interest rate ($4.47/day) with $422 monthly payments
•	Rent: $500/month all-inclusive

•	Phone: $40/month after taxes

•	No mortgage, credit card debt, car payments, and so on.  


I graduated last April with a $42k student debt. I’ve since brought it down to just under $32k. On top of the $422 monthly payments, I add $600 every month.

I also have $2,000 sitting in a tax-free savings account with an interest rate of 2.5 per cent until March–after the promotion period ends, interest will go down to 1.05 per cent. It’s there as an emergency fund.

I’ve also just made a budget following YNAB’s guidelines. I will start putting $200/month that I get from my parents in a normal savings account starting March. The interest rate for that account is 1.05 per cent. I want to use the money to save up for something, probably some traveling or a down payment on a car.

Other than that, my money goes towards groceries ($200/month), restaurants ($40/month), misc. food ($20/month) and gifts for Christmas and birthdays ($45/month).

I plan to put the extra money–if there is any–in my savings account.

So, any advice?

I have been looking at the possibility of buying a house recently. I have a few questions about the term of the mortgage. 

I believe the longest one can amortize a mortgage is 25 years in Canada. I have also seen options for Low Downpayment Insured Mortgages.   

The properties we are interested in are in the $425,000 area.  I live in a very expensive area of Canada and there isn't much option below that.  Unless you are interested in owning a glorified hotel room. 

We can afford to put down around $125,000 and still have money for any contingencies. But should we put it all down?  What type of interest rate is reasonable right now and it is better to go for a fixed or variable at the moment. 

The property would have about $3000 in yearly property taxes and maintenance fees.  It would be a condo. 

It is possible that we could rent out a room in the condo for around $500 a year. We would likely consider this for the next 5 years or so. Then I should have a better job and more consistent income.  

My SO is a small business owner who's income is fairly consistent but not guaranteed like some jobs. My income was stable but I will be going through a transition in the next year.

The way I'm interpreting this is that I owed $400 more in interest last year than the year prior. This confuses me because the principal balance goes down every month so wouldn't the interest accrued go down every year? 

Sorry if this is a stupid question or if I'm interpreting things wrong; I just can't find the answer to this anywhere.

So my understanding of QE is that the Fed basically creates money and uses it to purchase assets from banks, usually some form of debt like MBS or government bonds. So in essence the (non-central) bank gains a cash balance (reserves) and 'loses' an asset (a loan). This allows the (non-central) bank to loan the additional cash out which is meant to increase the supply of money/credit, push down borrowing costs, and thereby stimulate borrowing/investment.

So I was thinking, wouldn't it make sense for the central bank to just create money and directly give it to individuals/firms explicitly to pay off their debts? Because from a bank's perspective, someone paying off a loan versus the Fed buying a loan from them with printed money is effectively the same thing. So in much the same way the banks would wind up with the additional cash on hand, which they could then lend out again. Not only that, but it seems like this would also stimulate the borrowing side of the equation a lot more than normal QE, because rather than simply reducing borrowing costs it would be deleveraging borrowers, who would then be more willing to borrow/invest.

The other advantage I see here is that this arrangement would result in a relatively stable money supply/low risk of inflation because all the money created by the Fed would be associated with an equal and opposite destruction of credit as the borrower receiving the money pays down his debts.

The one potential downside I see here between this idea and normal QE is that in this case the central bank is essentially giving away money and doesn't receive any asset in return. That's obviously a pretty big distinction. But does that really matter? It actually seems like that might be an advantage because one of the problems with QE seems to be the question of how the central bank is going to unwind its massive balance sheet. But with this strategy, the Fed's balance sheet wouldn't change appreciably.

What are people's thoughts on this? What am I missing?",finance,1423170003
personalfinance,Deciding to Keep or Sell bond holdings,"After many lessons learned on PF and reading up on Bogleheads, I am happy to say my accounts are almost in order.  My next step is that I need to evaluate 2 bonds I am holding and decide whether or not I should keep or sell and seek my bond allocation elsewhere. I am 31 years old.

I bought these before I knew which way was up and because of this they are in a taxable account. I know the general rule of thumb is the bonds should be placed in a tax-advantaged account, but the kicker is that these are municipal bonds, which to my knowledge are tax free (or at least much of it is tax free?). I also bought them at a discount. Beyond that I am too much of a noob for this.  I've read through all the literature on the forums, but I have hit a wall and could use some direction from the pros. 

FWIW I have a 401k (non-matched) and TIRAs at Vanguard and Schwab. I can give more info on my allocation, however don't think its necessary to evaluate the bonds themselves. I figure my options are to keep here (if they tax efficient) or sell and get my bond allocation from vanguard total bond fund. I would rather not deal with headaches if it's not necessary.

personalfinance,[UK] I want to start learning about finance and budgeting whilst I'm still in a position to benefit greatly from it.,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I am 21 years old and I live in the Shetland Islands at the very north of the UK. I was never taught how to save money effectively or how to budget or calculate costs effectively etc when I was younger and I feel like I will be hindered by my lack of knowledge when the time comes to employ this knowledge.

My current situation is that I still live with my mother because we get along well and we don't bother each other, I actually quite enjoy it and it's cheap, she only takes £70 off of me every fortnight (I've argued that I don't feel right paying that but she refuses to take more off of me and gets mad if I put extra in her purse when she's not looking) which in retrospect is pretty damn good. 

I go to college here and the local council awards me ~£200 a fortnight for attending college as a self-supporting adult since I'm over the age of 21 which is also pretty good. I plan on getting a job at the place where I attend college which pays upwards of £7.50 an hour with negotiable hours.

So basically, I stand to save quite a bit of money at the moment but since I'm only really starting to get out of the way of frivolously spending every penny that I get on things that I don't really need, I don't really know where to begin.

I'm fed up of not having any money because of bad choices and while I'm not currently in any debt and there's no reason why I would have bad credit (I think), my lack of knowledge will undoubtedly lead me to make some bad decisions unless I start to learn now.

I would greatly appreciate any and all advice that you guys could give me but I suppose what I'm really looking for is a checklist of things that I should do in order to benefit myself in the long-term.

Any and all advice is appreciated, especially any negative criticisms that you guys could find. I am a fan of brutal honesty.

personalfinance,Considering a private ReFi of public student loan. What would I be losing by going private?,"I've got about $62,000 in debt and my interest rate is around 7 percent. I checked out SoFi and saw that they had some pretty decent looking rates for me. 

If pay only the required amount on time every month, then obviously the lowest interest rate is what you want. I got like 3.5% - 5% offered to me. 

But are there other benefits to federal loans that I wouldn't enjoy with SoFi? I guess there could be early payment penalties? I do know that the federal loans allow me to miss payments for up to 36 months. That could be useful, as I'm currently freelance, and my income isn't the most stable thing at the moment. I expect my future income to be much higher when I've either A) successfully got my freelance business off the ground or B) am forced to go back into regular employment.

Are there things specific to federal loans that aren't available through private loans?

personalfinance,I am a full-time college student with no job. Should I file taxes?,"Hey everybody! I have read the Taxes section of the FAQ but would appreciate some tailored advice. **I am so clueless about taxes that I do not feel like an adult.**

I am a 22 year old male living in Utah, attending university full-time. I am currently a Senior. I have rented a room off campus since I first started attending university, though my mother has always claimed me as a dependent/living at home on her own taxes. This past summer, I marked on my FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) for the first time that I live off-campus and not with a parent. I did this in hopes that I would be eligible for an increased amount of financial assistance.

I do not have a job. A combination of PELL Grants and federal subsidized/unsubsidized student loans pay for my tuition and rent. My grandmother sends me monthly checks in the amount of $250 for groceries and whatnot (bless her heart!). As far as I know, she doesn't claim this on her taxes (just under the table; is that bad?) 

In 2014, I worked for three days at a Temp Agency but then had to quit. I have a physical disability in my hip bones and standing on my feet for the duration of a shift caused too much pain (it was factory assembly work). I received a W-2 from the Temp Agency last week, and my *Wages, tips, other compensation* totals $384.10.

Would filing taxes benefit me in any way? Would I owe anything to the government in the form of taxes because of the monthly checks from my grandmother, my student loans, or the $384.10? Should my mother simply claim me as a dependent again? 

I have no income basically, and very low expenses so I'm curious as to how taxes relate to me. I'm not sure if what I've been doing is okay (not filing), or if I'm evading the government somehow. I appreciate any advice - it will help me become more knowledgeable myself for in the future. Thank you!",finance,1423176528
personalfinance,Starting a new job soon where I plan on contributing to my retirement for the first time. Few questions on that and other things.,"Fiscal responsibility is somewhat of a new thing to me, as I've been waiting for some type of stability to slap me in the face. Luckily I've managed to land my dream job. It pays $35k/year which I feel comfortable enough with to buckle down and do some damage to my debt. 

Reading through the FAQ it says I should contribute to employee-sponsored funds, which seems like the smart thing to do. I don't have the official papers, but I got a brief write up about their plan. I'm sure they'll explain more detail when I sign the actual papers, but I was wondering if I could get some clarification so I don't go in blind.

&gt;Provider: American Funds
&gt;Simple Plan
&gt;Employer matches employee contributions $1 per $1 up to 3% of employee’s salary and $.50 per $1 up to 5% of employee’s salary for a total of 4% employer contribution. The employee may contribute additional amounts to the fund up to federally set limits.

Now let me see if I have this straight:

If I plan on taking full advantage of the employee contributions, I need to contribute 5% of $35k which would be $1,750. Essentially I would be making $33,250. On that $1,750 the employer would match $1,400 for a total of $3,150/year.

When it comes to the federal limit (which is $18k in 2015?), I don't have to put that in, correct? It's only just the maximum.

----

Further side questions:

Right now I have about $6k in a credit card and $20k-30k in student loans. I'm confident I won't get buried by the student loans, but the credit card [APR 16.9%] is killing me. Parents set up for me when I was younger, so I have no clue how to approach credit cards. 

Should I transfer to a new one or just pay back this one? I read about the Avalanche Method, which seems to be my style. Can you can pay back too much at a time? I wouldn't mind going hardcore mode and doing $1,000/month if it means I'm done with it that much quicker. I feel like it would give me a good boost to attack my student loans.

personalfinance,I Need Help! (Financial Debt Advice Sorely Needed!),"So my most impending Financial Debts in life are;

$11,338.50 in school loans, $321.39 of which is in unpaid interest.

$1100.00 approximately in Capital One Credit card debt, two in total. I don't know what the interest/ penalties are, I will get more into it later.

So, 11339.50 + 1100.00 = 12439.50 total. Let's assume I need 12700.00 total to get me outta this mess because I can't get into Capital One right now.

.
.

My monthly debts are;

.
$450 in rent, single bedroom with everything included 

$60 in Kitty care, Litter and Food.

$250 Human food

$120 Transportation/ MetroCard

$30 Cell Phone

$60 Laundry

$220 Miscellaneous B.S./Needs as they come &amp; impulse purchases

$10.00 Toiletries (not a typo, these last two I'll explain  in the end.)

.
.

For income, I make on average $600 a week driving for Greyhound, after taxes, union dues and health insurance taken into account.

So, 600 x 4Weeks = $2400 per month.

.
.

I want to pay off these debts ASAP, and I have $2000 in the bank along with next month's rent (+450 = 2450 total) saved to do so in part with (My only security blanket god forbid I were to lose the Greyhound job).

.
.

If you were wondering why I don't have more saved is because in December 2014 I paid off a $700 PayPal debt and made a few Christmas purchases totaling $1100. (1100+700=1800) Combined with a move in November 2014 which cost me about $500 total.

(1800+500=2300 total)

.
.

I've been making this wage since mid-October 2014, when I finally ""hit the board"" as an on probation employee, and not just a minimum wage student driver training from the month before. I'm off probation now, so no B.S. excuse to fire me from the dirty dog!

.
.

On Capital One; I don't know the interest/ penalties from them because I tried and failed to sign in to the online accounts. That debt was racked up around April last year when Planet Fitness charged my card 4 times in one month and due to the restrictive work schedule I had at the time, I could not go to the P.F. manager in person to rectify the situation as requested by both Capital One and Planet Fitness corporate. Capital One's page gave me this message when I tried to log in just now; ""We're Unable to Log You In, Your access to this site is currently restricted. To check your balance or make payments, please call 1-800-bla-blah. (Ref. No. blah blah blah)"". I believe the last payment to them was in June 2014, but with me not being able to check online, I can't be certain.

.
.

The school loan has been out of deferment since Summer 2014, and I know there's a few options with MyFedLoan. I know it's been no good to keep my status with them this way and a main reason of why I took the Greyhound Job in the first place was to start paying them back fairly quickly compared to the last job ($12.50 an hour before taxes doing School Bus was no fun!)  I'm too scared to look into these on my own to find out what's the best option for me, but I just want someone who's outside the situation to be able to point me in the right direction with how to deal with this.

.
.

From my understanding of reading through various threads on here though (first found here http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections then elsewhere afterwords), you can write a personal dispute letter to the Credit Card company stating if you pay their debt in full, they should take off the negatives from your credit score. Is this true? And if so, what are the formalities of going about this? I want to fix the situation between me and the Gym and hopefully have those charges taken off the statements as well.

.
.

 Lastly, if I drive to and stay at a destination overnight for Greyhound, I usually snag the hotel toiletries instead. This has me giving away mini shampoo/ conditioner bottles and soaps at this point, and even toilet paper at times, lol. I honestly purchase only tooth paste/ brushes and razors at this point. This also has me thinking of tracking what other things I can cut down on, for just tracking those numbers I'm still spending $200 on god knows what per month ( I don't drink or smoke so it's been mainly impulse or clothing purchases I have to presume that I hadn't been keeping track of.)

.
.

That's all for now. I'm sorry if this is a difficult read, I tried being as concise as I can be and sometimes my literacy goes out the window when I think too much on any one subject.

personalfinance,Federal Savings Bond EE Series: Worth Keeping Until Maturity or Better Off in IRA?,"My very generous and forward thinking grandfather used to purchase Federal Savings Bonds every year on my behalf when I was a kid, and he gifted them all to me when I turned 21 (their issue dates run from 2001-2004). He also had a chunk of money sitting in a high interest savings account which he transferred to me when he learned I would be opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard last year. I had forgotten all about the bonds until recently when I was going through old documents. 
After looking up my bonds on the US Treasury website, I've found that their interest rates have dropped from an average of 4% when they were issued to about 1.5% (https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued051997_042005.htm#what). 
All but two of them reach their original maturity of 17 years by 2020, the other two will reach theirs by 2024. The Federal Reserve Website states:  ""If an EE Bond has not earned enough interest to be worth an amount that is double its purchase price on the date it reaches original maturity, Treasury will make a one-time adjustment on the original maturity date of the bond to make up the difference.""

This is my first question: does that mean they will change the maturity date to a later date so that it can sit and build interest until it has doubled - or - does that mean that they'll adjust the amount on interest that has accumulated so that it will be at its determined value by the original maturity date? 

My second question is this: My Roth IRA is a 2055 retirement plan, and I'm wondering if it would be better to just cash the Federal Bonds now and put what money I get from them to work in my IRA, or if it is better to just let them keep sitting. I'm just concerned about the adjustable interest rates being all over the place (just two years ago the rate was below 1%) to the point that they may be better off sitting in an online high-yield savings account and/or my IRA than with the Government.

personalfinance,Suggestions for debt/student loan repayment?,"I think I know the answer but I would like some advice from outsiders looking in to make sure this is the right thing to do in my situation...

I have a lot of bad debt from credit cards and a banking error (my fault). I also have a significant amount of student loan debt. The bad debt is probably around 8k in total and the student loan debt is 55k and growing (I've been in college for 6yrs and have 2 more years to go).

Since I've reached my mid 20s (alive) and have a good job with a very supportive company, I'd like to start saving for a house. In order not to be raped in interest (like I was on my car loan) I'd like to pay off all my bad debt and start chunking away at my student loan debt ASAP. My little issue is making sure working in that order is best.

My awesome company offers tuition reimbursement of $5,250/year as long as I pass, which is easy for a career student like myself. With that being said though, I'm racking up more than that in my student loans finishing at an online school. I'll probably be in about 70k in student loan debt by time I graduate. I have very low interest rates all the way around and less than half of them are earning interest while I'm in school.

Do you think I should pay off my bad debts to help rebuild my credit first and then chunk away at my loans, or switch the payments?",finance,1423204839

personalfinance,Advice on car payments.,"Hey guys and girls,

I was wondering what you guys would do regarding car payments versus saving/investing. After all taxes, I make $3, 808 per month. My rent is $950 (I have housemates) plus about $80 in utilities, but we'll say $1050 total to be safe. Before my first car payment, which is March 11th, I owe $18,900. My car payment is $300 a month, and insurance is $160 a month for now (I have a second car that I am selling / donating in a month or two. It's a piece of junk). A rough estimate of gas is about $120 a month. $300 per month on food / random life necessities. So adding that all of that together. So adding that all together, my monthly expenses are 1050 + 300 + 160 + 120 + 300 = $1930 (Assuming I can add correctly). I have about $4000 in the bank which I dont plan on touching. So after all bills I have about $1900 left. My plan is to pay at least double on the car payment (4% interest rate). I guess my main question is does it make more sense to pay off the car as fast as possible, or split between car and other investments. My work does not have any sort of 401k match or anything like that. What would you guys do?",finance,1423206447
gaming,The State of WW2 Gaming.,"Well, I'm just venting. Sorta. I'll try to keep it cohesive enough for you guys to enjoy reading.

Basically, there is a problem with WW2 games in general. War Thunder, World of Tanks, Red Orchestra 2, et cetera.

The problem is that they're either too limited in scope, or are screwed hard by &lt;nation here&gt; bias. Or just horrible, *horrible* incompetence on the part of the devs.

Example: War Thunder, while it prides itself on being a simulation, has gone overboard with vehicle bloat on the aircraft side of things (making it impossible to balance the tiers - it's a constant battle on the dev side), and the tank combat aspect feels incomplete. In addition to that, the matchmaker is a mess, and you often find yourself getting stiffed with a bad match on a regular basis.

World of Tanks is a great game, but it doesn't really fit my tastes - I'm generally a sim junkie. HP pools just doesn't fly for me.

Red Orchestra 2? Pretty fucking brutal. But I decided to not install it again because Punkbuster is a waste of space and a waste of processor power. Why Tripwire continues to insist on Punkbuster instead of Steam VAC, I'll never understand. On top of that, Tripwire has clearly shifted their focus to Killing Floor 2, the latest updates to RO2 were halfassed, and didn't live up to expectations. On top of that, the maps are just ""corridor warfare"" in a sense of the term - you don't have enough real estate on the maps to actually achieve a decent flanking maneuver, if the opposing side is watching all the angles.

Heroes &amp; Generals? ugh, don't get me started. The devs are like a boat without sails and the captain is AWOL. They have no idea what direction to take H&amp;G, and ended up overmonetizing the game model.

Essentially, WW2 games are now almost exclusively the providence of Free to Play, and it's gone to pot with shitty balancing, a lack of interaction with the community, and an autistic-like attitude on the devs' part.

What I really, *really* want is a truly amazing WW2 sim game that actually achieves what War Thunder is aiming for: a World War mode, but with bigger maps. Kinda ArmA 3 scale, and with more organic objectives and a focus on historical accuracy - none of this nationalist/patriotic bullshit that ends up fudging the numbers in favor of one side.

An objective game that doesn't get weighed down by progression bullshit (to get to Tier 5 in War Thunder, you have to burn a metric fuckton of time on it), and focuses more on skill and leadership, as well as strategic/tactical considerations.

Basically, I want a real war simulation that accurately reproduces the experience of World War 2. None of this whitewashed, dumbed-down bullshit we get in Free to Play, and none of this halfassery we see in games like Red Orchestra 2's end-product.

Let me bang out a bullet point list of features I'd want in the ultimate WW2 sim:

* Sim-grade accuracy on ballistics and armor representation.
* Large maps that cover an entire providence or larger. Would necessitate traveling from the base to the combat zone (and anything can happen).
* Combined Arms focus: Infantry, Air, Ground Vehicles, and Naval.
* No Free to Play bullshit. Instead, focus on DLC packages (tank packs, air packs, ship packs, etc that *enhance* the base game experience.)
* Dev process should focus on key combat theaters and featuresets before implementing featureset expansions. Example: Start out with the Western Front, focus on infantry, tank, and air combat. Don't go for quantity, go for quality on assets (two fighter planes per faction, etc).
* Organic objective creation, maybe an ""AI General"" that gives players general objectives to achieve, and they can achieve it however they want. Random or procedurally-generated mission objectives on the map that evolve as the war progresses.
* Maybe a multiplayer campaign mode similar to WW2 Online and H&amp;G's Generals Mode.
* Again, cherry picking certain vehicles that suit the game's needs, as opposed to going for quantity. For example, instead of trying to implement the entire British tank line, you could cherry pick certain tanks to be implemented according to the ""war era"".
* Expanding on War Era concept: During a multiplayer campaign, a war should have a beginning and an end, and be based on the actual development of new technologies. Each faction could accumulate research points and unlock new tanks for players to access as the war progresses. Example: At first, British starts out with a Vickers Mk VI tank at the outbreak of war, but by Winter 1940, after accruing enough RP, the Generals of the faction are able to unlock the next tank: the Britihs Cruiser Mk II, then an early model Churchill (can be upgraded as other technologies are unlocked), and eventually, my favorite: the British Firefly.

Well, I'm just rambling now, sorry guys. I'm just really wanting a proper, REAL WW2 multiplayer game that doesn't run around shoving its ""Pay $50 if you want to unlock one of ten tanks or gtfo"" balls in your face. Those games tend to have a poor retention rate of veteran players, and the end result is that the vast, vast majority of players are imbeciles.

I need advice how to stay ahead of the curve while not being insanely frugal.","I've just graduated, and got a job paying $78,000 a year. Been working there since I graduated in Summer 2014, and have no savings to boot.

**Income:**

 * $78,000 year (4.5% employer match, Traditional 401k)


**Savings:**

* 15% into my 401k


**Debt:**

* $1k Best Buy CC no interest until July 2015
* $6k no interest until Feb 2016 (Chase Slate card)
* $600 Sears CC no interest until July 2016
* $1.2k Furniture CC no interest until January 2018
* $500 on Personal CC, 20% APR
* $2k Car repair no interest
* $10k Student loans,

**Expenses:**

* $900/mo Rent + Utilities
* $150/mo Dog (Daycare, and Food)
* $600-700/mo in paying off debt.

**How would I best work to kill off debt and put myself in position to save to invest in a fancy savings account, down payment on a house, and what not?**

I don't have an emergency fund, or any liquid savings, yet. Parents are paying my student loans until I pay off my CC debt, they're decision not mine. They also scoffed at the idea of an emergency fund, because they feel like that's their responsibility. They live for their children, and I expect to pass that lifestyle to my children, but it doesn't mean that I don't feel guilty for relying on them to catch me when I fall. That's why I'd like to gain liquid as quickly as possible, so I can have my own emergency fund, and my own cash that I can leverage my lifestyle with whether it be a down payment on a home or investment funds.

**So what's the best way to keep myself ahead?**  I am really happy with my lifestyle right now, I can sacrifice a bit, but I in no means need/want to be living aggressively frugal. I am just getting stressed about my finances, when I feel like I shouldn't be since I make a lot compared to my peers.

I am confused about whether I should pay of my no interest loans ASAP. I don't see the reason to make smallest payments that will allow me to pay it off approximately 2-3 months ahead, but what I've read has pretty much ""pay off all debt"" without much regard to interest, other than pay off the highest first.

**Some things I want to try:**

* Having several banking accounts, one for monthly expenses, one for fun expenses, and one for savings. I currently have two accounts, one checking for everything, and one savings that does nothing because I suck at saving.
* Reducing my 401k to employers match, and use that excess to kill debt.

My apologies if I sound ungrateful, or irresponsible for letting my parentals help me out. But I'd really like some feedback so I can make a financial plan other than dumping money into 401k, and trying to stave off debt.

Some potential actions I have thought of:

*Moving - we renewed our year lease last month. If we broke the lease we wouldn't receive the deposit back, and after moving costs I don't think this would be adventitious to save possibly $150 a month (at this time)


*Electric, Gas - decrease usage, lower temperature of household. Might be able to save $50 a month here


*Car payment - I can already tell that the consensus will be to sell the car. I bought this particular car for a number of reasons. I was driving a 2008 hyundai santa fe with 22 mpg, $3,000 negative equity, and losing equity at a rate even faster than what my loan was paying down. I decided upon a base model, impreza wagon, which is a small but functional car. We have two kids, and also live in an area in which AWD is a must in the winter. I had previously owned a subaru and can attest to their excellent reliability as well as ability to hold their value. I my purchase price was $18,500 (plus tax, dealer fees, etc), but I had $3,000 in negative equity that I (stupidly) charged to a credit card, so that I wouldn't have as much negative equity on this car. I had looked at a couple of older volvo wagons, but after test driving them I found there were obvious mechanical problems that weren't being disclosed. As I know nothing about cars, I felt my safest option was to go with a new car that I know will last me at least 10 years. I am thinking of refinancing for a longer term with a slightly higher rate, I should be able to get an 84 month loan at 2.4% interest with around a $225/month payment.


*Student Loans - I can definitely lower my payment to $207 with a graduated payment option, and I might possibly be able to get approved for an income based repayment which will lower it to around 130 (but probably not, as I think our income is too high). I am set to start my next semester of school in March, and it should be my last semester, so these could go into deferment as well.


*Internet - I must have this as I am in an online-only bachelor's degree program, but I might be able to lower my bill to around 50 based on what the comcast rep said


*Phone - I plan to ask my parents if I could be added onto their plan for the duration of my contract (ends Oct '15), at which point I am completely open to a pay-as-you-go type flip phone


*Childcare - $120 (my half) per month is the absolute cheapest I can go, as we have no relatives or neighbors able to watch our youngest.


*Private tuition loan - Paying the minimum on this right now. I had misunderstood the terms of the loan when I took it out, I thought it was 1% interest but instead it wasthe payment starts out based on 1% of the loan balance. It's at 6% interest, and I'm about to have a $3,700 tuition bill due if I chose to go back to school next month.


*CC 1 - obtained to utilize a 0% balance transfer apr and 0% balance transfer fee. I maxed out as much as a could from CC 2, as it is a higher interest rate card.


*CC 2 - living outside of my means, mostly. I haven't charged anything on a credit card (except the balance transfer) since October. I had spent nearly $1,000 on my husband for his birthday, another $1,000 for a vacation we took on our anniversary. $3,000 was from negative equity on my car that the dealership allowed me to put on the card. The remaining balance is mostly from charging things if checking was getting low prior to payday.


*Trainer - Bad idea. Just bad. I still use the trainer and enjoy it, but I hate the commitment and can't get out of it (contract is written pretty tightly).


*Gym - Goes along with the trainer. I could lower it to $20, but that requires a 1 year contract.


*Daughter's rec activities - My daughter takes capoeira, which is two sessions a week at $50 a month, and gymnastics, which is $70 a month for once a week sessions. I don't spend a ton of money on her otherwise, but she really enjoys both activities. I have talked to her dad about helping out with the cost, and he says his mother might be willing to pay for them.


*Other house - So this is where all our trouble really began. 15 months ago, we were living in our first house, a townhouse. It's located in a really shitty, slummy town in Maryland. We both had a 3 hour round-trip commute. I bought the house because I thought I was honestly stuck there for a few years as I had shared custody with my daughter's dad. An opportunity arose for us to move to where we live currently, and her dad was in agreeance. We moved so that I could take a job paying $65,000 a year (after taxes) and have a 20 minute commute. We placed our house on the market last January; it's a two bedroom townhouse that's newer, with nice amenities. It's priced at $109,000, down from $119,000. We have switched realtors once, but have yet to receive a single offer. We owe $95,000 on it; it's a 30 year ARM, which doesn't begin to kick into the adjustable period for another 2 years. 4.5% interest. Mortgage with escrow is $670 a month, HOA fees are $60 a month, and basic utilities are $50 a month. We split the cost of the house, so it ends up being $400 a month. At one point we had the price lowered to $99,000 through the first realtor, but this did not produce a hard offer. Upon switching realtors in December, it was recommended to keep the price at $109,000. I am not willing to move back, as it would result in another change in schools for my daughter, as well as increase my commute and pretty much eliminate my probability of ever being able to attempt moving away again. I would honestly rather go bankrupt than move back to that awful town.


With all this, I have considered filing for bankruptcy and re-affirming my car. I plan to stay at my rental house for at least 4 more years, so I won't need to have my credit checked anytime soon for that. I mentioned that I had moved after taking a job making $93,000 a year; since that time, I have had to change jobs due to lack of child care, and now make around $40,000 after taxes.

My wife and I truly took the frugal February challenge seriously and are getting our financial house in order. We are both rather conservative in general w.r.t finance so our spending wasn't out of control but we need to start thinking about the next steps for us. 

The essence of the story is this.

Her: No debt, works as a skilled professional, 72,500 base with overtime usually reaches 90,000 a year pay. Has a guaranteed raise to 80k coming in July. No bonuses. 

Me: Third year medical student. Likely doing EM (3 or 4 year residency).

Us: 50,xxx liquid sitting in an ally savings account.

At this point we have 182,xxx at a mix of interest rates all hovering withing a few points of 6.0% We have been fortunate enough to receive a scholarship each year for 20,000 (about 1/4 of my cost of attendance) that is partially based on financial need. 

Last year was the first year she was making the kind of money she is now so we considered paying for a larger portion of school up front then but decided to borrow the same amount so that my financial need would be the same for this final year and we would (hopefully) receive the 20,000 scholarship for this final year as well. We decided to simply bank what we would have put towards school and are hoping that with that amount saved and what she makes during my final year, plus the scholarship we can pay cash for my final year of school. 

Now some questions:

I would obviously like to maintain some liquidity so during my last year we can pay for school outright. BUT it seems silly to have 50k sitting in a savings account, any suggestions?

Also we both have no credit history so we recently got the sallie mae mastercard. 500$ limit, can we use most of the limit (say 480$) to take advantage of the rewards and then pay it down to 15-20% before our statement to make sure our utilization ratio looks appropriate when reported?

Lastly we will be having a kid at some point, likely end of my first year of residency. We are hoping to live on my 50k during residency and put her 80k   towards loans that first year. As we exit the first year we would be at about 110k I suspect. After that she will likely work part time and we will only be able to put about 25k a year towards them for the last 2 years. I figure we leave residency around 70k in debt. At that point even a conservative job estimate for me is 300k (we want to chase that money down south) so it seems to me we could pay off the loan the first year after residency. Our plan is to do so and then start catching up on our retirement (we have none).

   I'm 30, went to school with the intention of getting a professional degree which would produce a salary starting in the six figures and make the loan managable. Unforeseen problems and situations arose at the wrong time and were unavoidable. I am now on the hook for  120k to the Federal Government. No private loans, and no way of completing the degree program. All options for that path have been exhausted.



   I didn't take out 200k to get a phd in some obscure field which is known to pay 20k a year. There was a plan that just didn't work out, and from what I see, it happens to quite a lot of people every year.


   I got a job making ~50k/year based off previous work experience. Under IBR, I am currently paying $0 for the first year since I applied for it right before I got the job. I will be expected to pay $300-400/Month in less than a year based on my salary.


   While I'm sure $50k is a salary many people would be happy to have, I live in an expensive city. My rent (for a small studio), utilities, trasportation, food budget, and other misc stuff that is necessary (ie dry cleaning for work clothes or other little things) make up a majority of my monthly income. When the time to pay $300-$400 a month rolls around, I will not have much left.


So what are my options? The way I see it, there a few, limited choices. Keep in mind, the interest rates on these loans are 6-8%, and in order to pay them off in 10 years on a normal payment schedule I would be required to pay close to $1,600 a month.


   1) Option one, stick with IBR, make payments when I can. I called, and even if I make 100k/year, my IBR payment would be about $1,000 a month. I am looking to get promotions in the next few years and see that salary potentially happening. But let's say that is 5 years out. My interest is accruing interest. If I put every dollar I can into it, it will still take many years to pay off. ~10 years of every dollar you have sucks, especially at 30, trying to start a life and family with my S/O.


   2) Option 2 - Stick with IBR, and always pay the absolute minimum.  Over 20 years, depending on salary increases, I can expect to pay 200k with a montly payment of $833. My payments will probably be less than that for a significant amount of time. I can have what is probably another 100k or 150k 20 years from now forgiven, and be stuck with an absurd tax bill because of it. 


   It isn't that I don't want to pay it back, but the interest rate is killer. Also, it is kind of sad because interest rates are at extrme lows for pretty much every other situation.


   I would appreciate any advice or any other ideas that I haven't come up with. Again, saving and cutting back on expenses are things I already keep in mind.",finance,1423235124

technology,The conservative account of internet reclassification. Is there any credibility to this account?,"EDIT: None of this is my words.  This was directly copied from a Email I received and I was wondering what reddit thinks about this other opinion.  


Since its inception, the Internet has been more or less free of government regulation. We all have unfettered and uncensored access to everything posted online. If the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and President Obama have their way, that will soon change.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed strict “net neutrality” rules that, if approved by the commission on Feb. 26, will regulate broadband Internet service as a public utility in much the same way the agency regulates telecommunications companies.

Sadly, consumers have been duped into supporting this travesty through misinformation and fear mongering by self-serving government officials, consumer advocates, and corporate executives. And just as with ObamaCare, there will be no walking this back once it’s done.

At the heart of the controversy is Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who has essentially claimed that Comcast and other broadband Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were intentionally throttling Netflix (NFLX) traffic in an attempt to extort the streaming video company to pay exorbitant fees for direct connections.

Apparently, none of that is true. What actually happened, according to a great Forbes article by best-selling author Larry Downes, is this:

Netflix had for years been using third-party networks from companies such as Cogent and Level 3 to get its content to ISPs that control the “last-mile” to consumers. That worked fine until Netflix content ballooned to nearly a third of all Internet traffic during peak periods, straining Cogent’s network.

It was never Comcast, Verizon or any other ISP throttling Netflix traffic, it was Cogent. During periods of heavy network usage, Cogent apparently slowed down its big wholesale customers like Netflix in favor of its retail customers, a practice it failed to disclose until recently.

That’s why Netflix traffic sped up as soon as it cut direct-connect deals with Comcast and other ISPs. Cogent was cut out of the back-end network. Problem solved.

Not surprisingly, large Internet content providers like Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and eBay (EBAY), and large content aggregators Akamai and Limelight have long-standing direct interconnection deals with nearly every large ISP. And now Netflix, which generates more traffic than all of them, does too.

That’s why you have no problems getting content from anyone and everyone. The free market worked it out the same way it’s been doing for decades, with new technology and business agreements and essentially no government oversight. And all those back-end deals, also known as paid peering agreements, have absolutely nothing to do with the last-mile to your home.

Meanwhile, all the nonsense about paid prioritization and Internet fast lanes that would favor some content over others is nothing but fear mongering by consumer groups that want government controlled everything.

The truth is, no ISP would ever consider something as ludicrous as discriminating against specific Internet content or prioritizing what comes down the last-mile to your home. Nothing like that has ever happened over the more than 20 years the Internet has been around and nothing like that ever will. The entire notion is idiotic.    

When it comes to net neutrality, there are only three questions anyone needs to ask and here are the answers:

&gt; Q: Did Comcast or any other ISP throttle Netflix traffic? 

A: Nope.

&gt; Q: Then why is Hastings fighting so hard for the FCC to step in?
 
A:Unlike all the other big content providers, Netflix has a lousy business model. He’ll apparently do just about anything to get a free ride on content delivery and improve the company’s slim profits.

&gt; Q: What if ISPs continue to consolidate and increase their pricing power? A: That’s an antitrust issue for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Those agencies have the power to approve or kill any such mergers.

Mark my words. If the Obama administration and the FCC manage to pull off this massively manipulative and devious power play and end up in control of broadband Internet service, we will all pay for it in more ways than one. Senator Ted Cruz was right. Net Neutralityis ObamaCare for the Internet.

personalfinance,"Have about $22,300 in credit card and student loan debt. Bank is giving me some options on personal loan options to pay it down. Thoughts?","First is the credit card which would take $12,100 to pay down completely. Right now I pay about $475/month with a 8.5% interest rate. From the online calculators I've seen, it will take me about 29 months to pay this off, costing me around $1,300 in interest.

The second is my student loan which has a balance of $10,200 and an interest rate of 6.125. I pay $198/month on that right now. At this rate, it will take me five years to pay off, costing me about $1,670 in interest. 

I'm maxed out on the total payment for each of these at about $673 ($475+$198). 

My credit union is offering me a personal loan at 4.85% for 24 months or 5.85% at 36 months. 

It seems like it's a no-brainer to take advantage of their offer. The question is how to break it out. Paying it all off within 24 months at 4.85% isn't feasible considering I can only pay $673/month. 

So do I pick a lesser amount that allows me to keep the 4.85%? Or do I just pay it all off at 5.85%? If I do the lesser amount, how should I break up the total between the two so I can maintain spending no more than $673/month while paying as little interest as possible?

Stipend and Expenses

The Sea Grant Program or Project receives and administers the overall cooperative agreement of $55,000 per student on behalf of each fellow selected from their program. Of this amount, the eligible Sea Grant Program or Project provides $45,000 to each Fellow for stipend and living expenses (per diem). Of the total cooperative agreement amount, the Sea Grant Program or Project provides $9,000 to cover mandatory health insurance for the fellow and moving expenses. Any remaining funds of the $9,000 shall be used for the fellow during the fellowship year, first to satisfy academic degree-related activities, and second for fellowship-related activities. Finally, up to $2,000 from the total $55,000 can be used to cover placement week costs. Indirect costs are not allowable from the federal funds either for the fellowships or for any costs associated with the fellowships, including the $2,000 budgeted for placement week (see 15 CFR 917.11(e), ""Guidelines for Sea Grant Fellowships""). During the fellowship, the host may provide supplemental funds for work-related travel by the fellow.

So my question is, what is my tax liability on this? Is it all considered income? I was told by a former fellowship recipient that the tax liability was minimal, but I don't know why it would be. I paid a 3500 to the feds for my first quarterly payment, but stopped doing so and just saved up 20% of all the payment in a bank account.

I don't even know what sort of document I'll receive from the SG program (adminstered by University of Michigan).

- After paying off the 7.8% interest loans, is there any benefit putting half of the $950 into a Roth IRA since I'll be in a significantly lower tax bracket during my residency years, or is the benefit not worth it and I should just pay off all my 6.5% loans before starting to contribute more toward retirement?  
- Unfortunately, even with this plan, I don't believe I'm paying the yearly interest of my loans and my loan debt will continue to increase every year while in residency.

personalfinance,Are we crazy to just pay the minimums?,"My wife has roughly $200,000 in student loan debt with an average interest rate of 7.5%.  We are considering either the Income Based or Pay As You Earn repayment plan, with the ultimate goal of qualifying for loan forgiveness in 25 or 20 years respectively.  At the moment I'm unsure if  we can consolidate the loans such that we can qualify for the PAYG but either way it seems to me that paying the minimum (which will be far under the interest) is the best option.  My wife is an attorney who runs a solo practice.  My income is enough for us to live off of.  As I understand it she should be able to contribute up to $18,000 of her income to a 401k as an employee with an additional $6,500 going to an IRA.  In addition she can 401k match as an *employer* an aditional 20% of her income.  It seems to me if she maxes out those limits, as long as we file separately her student loan payments will be kept quite low.  I've played around with [this calculator](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action) and depending on the assumptions I make for her adjusted gross income we are left with having paid somewhere between 50k-150k during the 20-25 year period with a forgiveness amount ranging between 200k-475k.  In the worst case we would pay tax somewhere between 35-39.5% on the outstanding balance depending on our deductions that year.  Even worst case paying the 39.5 on 475k is $187,000.  Add the 50K we paid over the course of 25 years and our total paid is less than if we paid the standard plan at 2,300 per month for the next 10 years ($277,000).  The discrepancy is much greater when considering that $277,000 is in 2015-2025 dollars where as that $187,000 will be in 2040 dollars.  I know the mantra is always pay down debt first, so my question here is, am I crazy not to?


Edit-  To those complaining that I'm bilking the American taxpayer here consider my options.  

*  **Option 1** 
I pay the standard payment plan (something I'm not even capable of at this point but whatever)  The IRS misses out on $84,884 of taxable income during that time that gets put towards interest.


*  **Option 2**
My wife maxes her 401k and averages 27,000 per year during that 20 year period.  We then owe the IRS say 150k and they foot the remaing 300k or so bill.  Now you need to remember that the money we put into our retirement will be ~4,500,000 by the time we retire at 65. So that money now gets taxed and **the US taxpayer makes more money** than had we paid off the loans in the first place.",finance,1423253840
personalfinance,[YET ANOTHER] Student loan interest question: Accrued vs Capitalized interest,"So I know there are lots of discussion about student loan interest on here and I tried reading some of them but I think mine may be a little different. I understand how to calculate interest based on the interest rate and days since my last payment. That’s fine and all. To preface my question I’ll explain my system first. At the beginning of every month in my budget I record the outstanding balance of all my loans and put them in one column. Because I get paid every other Friday, my “monthly” budget is only 28 days long. (except for twice a year when it’s not because there are 52 weeks in a year) Then I subtract whatever the monthly payment is which then gives me the new balance. At the end of the 28 day period, I record the actual balance again and then calculate the difference. 

For example:
Loan A starts with $1,000 balance, monthly payment is $100 (paid sometime in the middle of that 28 day period obviously) so that leaves me with $900 on my spreadsheet. At the end of the 28 day period, however, the balance is actually $925. (just making up numbers)

So in that example I’m saying the interest accrued during that period is $25. Let’s assume every month comes out to $25 and so the total interest accrued for the year using that rough method is $300. Problem is, when I get my 1098-E from the lender in January, the number ends up being much more than $300, and even twice that. What’s going on? I understand it has something to do with capitalized interested and I think most of my loans unfortunately were unsubsidized loans. But I thought they just took whatever interest accrued during college and then added that big chunk to the loan before the repayment period started? How can I accurately calculate my total interest I’ll pay each year? To me it makes sense that my method would be correct (and one of my loans it is correct, I think it’s a subsidized loan). I can provide screenshots of some numbers if it helps. 

Another related question: Each month my monthly payments are the same but when I look back at the history of the breakdown of how much went to the principle and how much went to interest, it varies. I’m assuming this is because I make my payment at different times each month?",finance,1423255580

5. Friends have recommended that I get a card through a retailer (I know TOO MANY people with Old Navy credit cards). Is there any real advantage to getting a card through a retailer? My gut says this is a bad idea. I don't have a real reason for this.

6. Any specific cards or credit companies that are known for being particularly good for starters?


I'm not sure if there are any other questions I should be asking. Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.

personalfinance,"(CAN) £95,000 GBP available, £28,500 GBP student loan. Now live in Canada on $60,000 CAD p.a. - Buy an Apartment? Pay off loan? Wait?","So I was lucky enough that my Grandfather who died in the 90s put a load of money aside for me in investments in the UK that's now worth £95,000 GBP and was intended to go towards a downpayment on a property.

I'm 25 and live (permanently now) in Vancouver, Canada. I earn around $60,000 CAD per year but there's a 65ish % chance this will go up to $70,000 at the end of the month (renegotiating contract). I also have a student loan of £28,500 GBP in the UK to pay off that's currently at a 1.5% interest rate. I earn around $4,000 a month after tax and spend about $1,000 of this on rent / bills, save $2000 and spend anywhere between $500 and $1,000 of the rest.

So, currently the CAD is trading at $1.91 to GBP (was ~1.6 3 years ago when I came over). which means that that £95k GBP is worth a lot more than it used to be, but also that my student loans relative to what I'm paid are a lot more.

I was thinking on possibly buying an apartment out here ($400,000 with ~ $200 / month strata fees) as I'd be able to afford almost a 50% downpayment and can start putting what's currently rent towards equity. I'm also planning on heading off to a more rural area in 2-3 years and buying a house / property there so would likely sell the apartment then if I did buy one.

My question is, would it be better to pay off my student debt with the money in the UK and using the rest for a downpayment, taking advantage of the exchange rate? Paying off debt and keeping the rest invested and paying rent for 2-3 more years? Using it all on a downpayment? Using none of it at all? or ???

recap:
$1.91 / £
£28,500 student debt in UK @ 1.5%
$400,000 apartment with $200/mo strata fee

£95,000 available
$60,000 p.a.
$4,000 / month post-tax income 
($1000 on rent+bills, $500-$1000 on living, rest saved)

personalfinance,Mortgage strategy - buying first home,"My fiance and I have been looking at purchasing a home together, and I've been wrestling with the whole ""pay it off as quickly as possible to avoid interest"" strategy vs ""take advantage of the low interest rate and invest our money instead of racing to pay off the mortgage"" strategy. 

For the most part I understand the advantages and disadvantages of both strategies, but there is one scenario that I'm having trouble wrapping my head around. 

Suppose we choose to go with a longer 30 year Mortgage, and we invest our extra income at a greater rate of return after tax than our Mortgage interest rate after tax breaks (so the strategy is working). But then 5 years down the road we need to relocate due to work. Does selling our home in this scenario hurt us more than if we would have went with a 15 year mortgage and had been putting our extra cash into paying it off early? Does it make a difference? I think I know the answer to this, but I'm curious what others think.

I'm 28, with a college degree (BS Poli Sci, waddup useless debt?!) that I can't seem to find any relatable job in (I live in TN, 2nd lowest voter turnout in the nation, but also I guess I'm not creative enough at coming up with jobs to search for and have no idea what I want to do) so I'm making $26k/yr as a fucking receptionist! And can you believe I was voted ""Most Likely to Succeed?!"" Yeah, I know right?! 

Anyway, I fucked my credit up years ago; I'm taking it very seriously now, and I've raised it 60 points in 6 months, but I'm at a 620 solid across the board right now. Still some work to do, which I'm actively working on daily, so I've got that going for me, which is nice. Had to find a use for all that fucking free time in my dream job position, ya know! 

So here's the situation-- and thanks for sticking with this post so far, by the way-- I hope you enjoy reading the bitterness as much as I enjoy dishing it out!-- I have a financed vehicle that I'm $4k under water on and only 6 months into the loan term of 60 months at an interest rate I'm not even going to bother mentioning because I can't even handle the people in this sub that remind all of us with high interest rates we HAD to accept at the time how shitty we are. 

Said car has turned out to be a piece of fucking death metal that hydroplanes at the fast speed of 35 mph with brand new dope ass tires. I want to refinance it or preferably trade it in for something safer so that I can commute to the city for a higher paying job. So, I'd have some negative equity, but I could potentially more than double my income at a job I already have a lead on that I'm extremely qualified for. Right now I'm too scared to drive this shit in the rain because you can't make money when you're dead, now can you?! I'm at peace with the trade off, and knew going into buying my current car that I would have negative equity, but it was a necessary step in my life and eventually it will lead me a step forward. I thought it all out and decided the benefits outweighed the risks. Anyway.  

Went to my dealership today, who are THE BEST GROUP OF PEOPLE EVER, and still couldn't get financed, because I have ZERO cash down. Which again, isn't really a surprise. So, I need at least $4k cash to offset the negative equity before I can get financed on anything. 

I've also been turned out three times for a refinance now. That I actually did not expect, and I'm feeling super fucked right now. Even more fucked than I thought I knew I was going to be. 

I've just come out of working two jobs at 60-70 hours a week for the last year. So while I agree thats a good option for building cash flow, I just can't do it. I developed sciatica, depression, gained 40 lbs, and it severely affected not only my work performance at both jobs, but my relationship with my partner, which I decided was just unacceptable. I'd consider something part time again, if you have ideas on anything other than serving or retail, though. 

I'm bringing home $1600 a month. My health insurance is $200. Car insurance I got down to $50 with full coverage. I'm about to switch to sprint, which will bring phone bill down to $32. Those changes alone will bring me an extra $150 per month. Rent $350, HOA $100, car payment $380, gas about $100, then I pay half of cable and utilities if I can, but lately I can't. I also am eating Paleo because I gained so much weight and my doctor requires it, which brings food bill up, and my prescriptions are about $100/mth with insurance. I pay $50 towards my credit card (balance $430 out of $500 limit, so I'd like to focus on killing that first), and I pay $16/mth for Spotify for my niece and nephew and Dad which I can't bring myself to cancel. I haven't even started on student loans yet, which also bothers me, but when I do, they'll be $86/mth on the income percentage plan, all consolidated. 

I also got fucked on taxes due to my second job screwing up my allowances and my dumbass not noticing all year, so I'll have to come up with $500 for taxes by April. 

So $1600 in, and $1268 out before food or paying any extra towards bills. My goals are: 

1. $500 by April
2. $450 asap for credit card 
3. Save $4k for tradein ASAP-- most important right now-- besides paying taxes on time-- because that means better paying job
4. $600 old debt collection bill 
5. $2700 old debt collection bill 

Of course I'm terrified of having no savings as well, so that's constantly in the back of my mind. If we can add that in, it'd be super cool. 

The entire time I will also be working on disputing incorrect information on my credit report as well, which hopefully will lead to a better score. There are still about 4 incorrect negative items that I legitimately have already paid. And some hard inquiries that might be worth disputing.

personalfinance,Is a pro-rated signing bonus really a bonus or a risk? Explanation inside:,"Ok so I just converted from contractor to full time (IT). I am getting a $20,000 signing bonus that is pro-rated over 24 months. So if I get fired or quit, then I have to return a portion of the money equal to the amount of time I haven't worked. 20k divided by time, basically. 

Thing is, I get that 20k minus taxes, which will be calculated with federal withholding as if it were a regular part of my income. So realistically speaking I will receive 12k after taxes are taken out at best. That means if I should get fired IMMEDIATELY after getting hired (not something I'm worried about obviously as I did a terrific job and that's why they hired me) then I will have to return all 12k of my bonus PLUS $8,000 that I would have to pull from my remaining checks and my own bank!

Now, how long would it take me to ""earn"" that $8,000 from the company by staying there, thereby mitigating the risk of having to return money I didn't get from them? About 10 months. So after 10 months, I will have stayed long enough that should I get fired, I would only have to return the 12k post-tax bonus I got. 

In other words, from the day I start until about 10 months in, they gave me the ability to hold onto cash that I don't really own, and moreover, the possibility that I will have to pay them wages and cash up to $8,000. So what am I going to do? Right now my plan is to increase my savings from a 5-6 month emergency fund which I have now to that, plus $8,000 of my own money I will have to build up, PLUS the roughly $12,000 bonus money I will receive after tax. 

Am I missing something here? My job pays me well enough that it's not going to be too stressful saving up 8k, but goddamn if it isn't an inconvenience once I figured this out. Full time benefits still outweigh contracting since the money is the same (actually slightly better), but this bonus bullshit doesn't help.

I was supposed to graduate Spring of 2014, but decided to take a 5th year to study abroad because I felt it was a great opportunity and would open up a lot of options in my field. It was to be from mid August 2014 to end of May 2015. I am 100% dependent on financial aid and felt this would be worth it.

I had to borrow money for initial housing and plane tickets before my financial aid kicked in. It added up to 3k which was repaid to a family member immediately. This took a large chunk of my aid and ensured I'd have to live frugally. However, my mother then used several thousand dollars my aid to pay bills, a parking citation, and other necessities. We have also struggled financially, so I don't think she understands how that my financial aid allI could get. I was not eligible for private loans, so everything from federal loans and school grants. 

Because of this, I had almost no money left by mid October to survive other than rent. The only money left I had, I booked a plane ticket home on very short notice. I left at the end of October and was forced to withdraw from the program. I received an email from federal loans saying I completed a certain percentage of that semester and that my loans were considered valid and were to be repaid as normal with the others.

Yesterday afternoon (4 months after returning home), I received an email from my UC study abroad office that I owe almost 5k in grant money by March 7th or everything is on hold/suspended. I can't even pay the $19 processing fee for my diploma. Which they are now adding more fees to because I can't pay and round and round we go.

personalfinance,Traditional IRA and Form 5498 questions,"Today I met with the financial advisor who I set up a Traditional IRA account with in 2013. The account is composed of mutual shares via Fidelity Advisor Freedom 2050 Fund® Class A (http://money.cnn.com/qu)ote/mutualfund/mutualfund.html?symb=FFFLX). He's a great advisor and answered several questions. I expressed concerns to him that I was using post tax income (income obtained from my payroll direct deposit) to buy the mutual fund shares.. and that I may be screwing up as the account is a Traditional and not a Roth. He told me not to worry as Traditional contributions are deducted from my income on my federal tax return.  

Hence the 5498 question. I looked and I received my 5498 for tax year 2013 in May of 2014. I have yet to receive my 5498 for Tax Year 2014. I took a look at Fidelity's website (https://www.fidelity.com/taxes/statement-mailing-dates) and it stated I should have already received a 5498. Except that on January 15th of this year I made a contribution into the IRA; I think it counted for Tax Year 2014 as the 5498 date of May 11th indicates for (IRA, if you made a contribution for the 2014 tax year between January 1, 2015, and April 15, 2015). 

Question to /r/personalfinance users - do you know of a way I can find out my contributions I made with my post federal income tax payroll income into the IRA account for the year 2014 before May? I would like to get my taxes filed soon.

Another  question: Did I understand the financial advisor correctly when he advised that Traditional IRA are considered as ""qualified"" pre-tax contributions because they are tax deductible? As in, my employer pays me $X per hour. Federal Govt taxes that income and I earn a paycheck of say 75% of X when payroll taxes are all said and done for. I use that post tax payroll money to purchase mutual funds with fidelity wrapped in the Traditional IRA shell. Those contributions are then added at the end of the year, and deducted from my income and thus modifying it so I have a lower adjusted gross income?

The following month I took a 5.5 day vacation (I told them about it during the interview) and then didn't come to work for a day because they were a week late paying me. I was fired on 18 April 2014 because of that.

My W-2 says I earned $2878 (wtf) and paid $258 in FedTax (ok), $362 in SS (wtf), and $84 for Medicare (wtf). After taxes and deductions, I was actually paid $1179 for March and $496 for April.

I never received my April paystub but here is my March paystub: http://i.imgur.com/Rhu0TNU.png 

Somebody please help me understand this. I am still overseas and can't really get good advice on this. The on-base tax center is full of people who know far less about taxes than I do.  TurboTax won't even let me finish my return because I paid too much SS (13%). My old boss is the only person I know or who I can make contact with within the company and is a horrible person. The address on the W-2 leads to a small house in a TX neighborhood which gives me a bad feeling.

Thanks.

gaming,What's Your Plan For Tackling A New RPG?,"I recently started Dying Light and I love it. It's very interesting to me how they've worked RPG elements into a First Person Zombie Smashing thriller.

But like all RPGs, there are !'s everywhere. Those pesky questing icons, begging to be plucked. In the past while playing RPGs, I've ran around an area and gobbled up all of the !'s without really thinking too much about each mission and more along the lines of planning my attack of them.

""Ooooh, so the story takes me over here, so I can knock these three out as well."" That was my mentality. But for Dying Light, to be more engulfed in this Zombie Apocalypse, I felt like I should stay on the straight and narrow. Also, it's a Zombie Apocalypse so taking your time, strolling around the open world isn't really advantageous unless you're looking for a fight. So far, all I've done are the story quests. I'm enjoying the game, love the flow, the characters (Jade is my newest video game crush), and can't wait to see where it takes me. Every time I get back into the Tower though, I see those !'s and have to quell the urge to snatch all of them up.

But one thing that I am struggling with is a nagging question in the back of my head, ""What am I missing by not doing the side quests?!"" An orange weapon? A new outfit? An awesome side quest story? The XP to make my character OP through the story? Shit, will I even be interested in doing the side quests if I've finished the story?

Conversely, I've heard of people, for instance in Skyrim, that JUST do side quests as soon as one is available. I had never thought about doing that, but that's a very interesting idea. 

I'm also juggling Dragon Age: Inquision currently and I do wonder constantly if I'm getting the most out of the game.

So to come full circle, how do you play RPGs? Is there a set of strategies that you follow for them? I understand that the easy answer is to just play it how you want to play it, but I'd love to hear some thoughts from Redditors.",technology,1423311643

personalfinance,First time Home Buyers - How much to afford? May be Info overload. Details,"Hi All,

Been reading around PF for a long time now and read many of the suggestions, comments and informative posts on the FAQ.

It seems may be running into information overload with all that's out there. Hoping to maybe get some insight from redditors who may have been in a similar situation or who are familiar with the situation.

My wife and I are both 30. We make approximately $88,000 Gross Income. From all that we've been reading seems that Mortgage Interest rates are going to jump this year so a purchase probably makes sense. 

With the below data, I (husband) have figured a $300K purchase with 5% down, $285K loan would be reasonable. Would like to hear what others think about this.

Important data can provide more if needed.

Current Debt Impacting Credit 

* Car Loan - $267 ($9.5K remaining)

* Student Loan - $69 ($3.6K remaining)


Current Debt Not Impacting Credit (Parent Liability, paying them)

* Student Loan - $180 ($11.5k remaining)  


Current Savings

*  Emergency Fund - $17K  

*  Downpayment Savings - $37K  

*  Budgeted Car Repairs Monthly - $150  

*  House Furniture (We live pretty simple) - $5.2K  

*  Retirement - We both have 401K that we match, her = 3%, him = 5%  


We spend about 3.2K per month in our current situation. According to calculators out there we would increase ~$1k on our current rent situation ($800) with PITI &amp; PMI. 

Living in Arizona I'm sure our electricity will raise from our current $60-100 as well we'll need to pay Water, Sewage, Trash and HOA (if applicable).

Looking at houses in the range I approximate the feeling is initial repairs will be limited.
     
As you see from above, some of the savings are over what it should be - eg: Downpayment. If we go with 5% down we can roll the rest into emergency and have a comfortable 6-8 mo emergency fund.

I just had my review at work which was positive as did she, so I'd so we're relatively comfortable (an 8 on a 1-10 scale) in our current positions.

personalfinance,Questions about refinancing a small mortgage. Got a quote.,"I have a mortgage with a fairly high rate and I've been trying to refinance. Yesterday I got a quote from a bank with the following information. 

Current mortgage: $~32,500 @ 7%

Refinance: $50,000 @ 3.284%. APR is 3.71%.

In order to get a better interest rate, I had to go the cash-out route and take at least 50k. The mortgage officer told me there would be nothing preventing me from just taking the extra amount and paying my principle back down with my first payment. The rest of our debts are subsidized student loans that are in deferment until at least November. I could use the cash-out excess to pay those off, but I don't know if it makes sense financially since no interest is currently accruing.

About $1500 in closing costs is rolled into the $50k. $445 to have my house appraised to assure its current value is at least $62.5k (very likely).

The decision seemed like an obvious ""yes"" at first but now I'm not so sure. Questions: 

- I'm not clear on what the difference between the mortgage interest rate and the APR is. Why are they at different rates? 
- Until I got the documents sent over, The loan officer gave me the impression that all refinance costs were rolled into the interest rate, but this apparently isn't the case. Do no closing costs (through higher interest rate) even exist for a 50k mortgage?
- I anticipate that our mortgage will be paid off in three years or less regardless of refinance. Based on that assumption, should I refinance at all when I'm losing $2000 to refinancing itself?
- My existing mortgage is by far the oldest account I have at over six years. How hard of a hit would my credit potentially take by closing it?

personalfinance,Where to keep a sum of money during grad school (PhD),"I have been working for the past year and a half and am now going back to do my PhD in engineering. My stipend will depend on which school I end up selecting, but after accounting for federal and state tax, I'll have ~$25k/year, probably a little more. This will definitely be enough for me to live off of, even with a car payment. I make significantly more right now, but still generally keep my budget at the level I'll need it to be - and I have plenty of room to tighten up.

I plan to have about $25k in cash set aside before I quit my current job and take a little break ahead of school. Let's call it $22k when school starts. I am thinking it will be good to have some money set aside for large expenses such as attire for conferences, winter attire if I go somewhere up north, maybe 6-month car insurance premiums, an annual travel home allowance. So I intend that money to be used for these kinds of expenses but not my monthly budget.

What's the best way for me to keep this money and earn some kind of return on it while I'm in grad school. A CD ladder? A brokerage account? Savings account? Dump my last 2-3 paychecks into my 401k instead and then do one of the above with the remainder? 

I would say my I'm moderately willing to accept some risk. Liquidity is moderately important but I really only need to be able to access $5k or so a year (I think). I really don't like the idea of a large EF sitting in savings.

Other facts (balances estimated 6 months from now):

-$20k in retirement accounts, $8k in Roth IRA (accessible without penalty if absolutely needed)

-$12k still to pay on car loan, 4% now but plan to refinance down. Slightly underwater. Willing to consider paying it off now but I'd rather not; maybe this is stupid.

-$14k left in subsidized stafford loans that will go into deferment and won't accrue interest while I'm in school (3.15%)

-In my field it's likely I'll do 1-2 well-paying internships that will allow me to save more as well.

-Single and not likely to have kids anytime soon.

-Will have health insurance through school.

personalfinance,(Advice Request) College students looking for apartment,"TLDR AT END

My girlfriend and I are generally very frugal people. About 2 years into college, we've been able to maintain debt free, buying our on cars, repairs, insurance, gas, food, etc. by living rent free in my fathers basement.

We're reaching a point where we're looking at apartments, as they seem the obvious choice for a budget lifestyle.

I'm worried about unaccounted/unexpected expenses. There's no way for me to know for sure how much the ""variable"" expenses will be (water sewer garbage electricity, even internet because I know rates change after introductory periods)

In order to do this we're practically maxing out our budget, leaving about $150 a month for ""other"" (non food/normal bills. Other includes everything from toilet paper, to light bulbs, to fixing our broken down car).

One thing I want to look into is if times get tough (I've got about $5,000 in savings for university), dipping into that and looking into students loans. I don't have a clue how student loans work though...


Tldr: -How much is a reasonable but frugal budget for ""other"" expenses.
-What is the basic rundown of student loans (how they work, when is payment due, how much interest, etc)

Edit: I read somewhere that a 6.8% interest rate of $5,000 costs you $340 a year. Does this mean that if you pay $5,340 in 1 year, your loan is gone? Also, I've heard student loans sometimes aren't due until you graduate. Is this a ""4 year or graduation"" type thing?",finance,1423334848

The reason I'm considering leasing is the lower monthly payments and that it might be easier to get approved with my bad credit, plus I can always buy it out at the end of the lease if I like the car. But if I'm putting that much down would I be better off finding a slightly used car to finance and that way I'm building equity?

I think we are doing “OK” with our finances.  We could for sure be doing a lot better, but could also be doing a bit worse.

Our household consists of me, my wife, and our 1.5 year old daughter.  We are planning for a 2nd sometime in the next few months.  My wife and I are both 30 and both work (and the plan is for this to continue after the 2nd).

Our current savings consist of:
$70k in my 401(k) (Vanguard Target Date)
$33k in my Roth IRA (Vanguard Target Date)
$25k in my wife’s 401(k) from a past employer. (Fidelity Target Date)
$22k in emergency fund savings (Capital One 360).  I think this would cover ~4 months of expenses. More if we started trimming which we would if we were tapping into this.
$9k in daughters 529. (Vanguard 529)
$3k in a rainy day / short term savings (for car maintenance, etc.)
$3k checking account balance (at start of each month)
$40k in I-bonds earmarked for a house fund

We don’t have any student loans or credit card debt, but are still paying off my wife’s car. (2 more years of payments $420 a month w/ 1.9% interest)

Until recently we had a larger savings but took out $30k to fund a company I started 6 months ago with 2 partners.  The company is stable and proving to be profitable from the beginning.  We have built up 3 months and will soon have 6 months of operating capital.  My income is completely derived from the company.  My base salary is $100k and my wife’s is $80k (from another employer) so combined total income of $180k.  This doesn’t include any bonuses from my company [which I expect to range between $50-100k (likely in the middle) or my wife’s ~$5-10k].

Our monthly take home after tax is $9,417.  Prior to this we:
-max out my 401(k) and company matches 4%
-contribute $3k to wife’s FSA for daycare expenses.
-pay for any dependent health, dental, vision costs.
-my wife does not currently participate in her 401(k) but will when she is eligible for matching in June.  She will likely contribute 4% to obtain 6% company match.

We’ve been using Mint for awhile and have the following budgeted:
-$2,950 to house fund
-$50 for baby supplies (not including diapers, but for clothes, toys, etc.  Things not purchased at a grocery store / costco as those just get lumped in with groceries)
-$1,800 for rent
-$800 for entertainment (high I know)
-$700 for groceries (includes diapers, laundry detergent, other household items as well, also fairly high)
-$558 for daycare (rest is paid for with FSA)
-$420 for wife’s car payment
-$387 for personal funds (clothes, hair cuts, etc.  We have a joint checking account for almost all purchases and personal accounts with $45 a week to be used however we choose.)
-$320 for utilities + cell phones
-$300 to 529 account
-$269 for Rainy Day Fund / Misc. Overflow unclassified relatively mandatory purchases(doctor copay, car maintenance, car registration, etc.)
-$200 towards vacation fund
-$150 for gifts (weddings, baby showers, christmas savings, etc.)
-$108 for house cleaners
-$100 for gas
-$100 towards emergency savings (to keep up with inflation)
-$95 for life insurance
-$87 for auto insurance
-$23 for renters insurance

Questions I have are fairly general:

1) We are looking to buy a house as soon as practical.  We live in an expensive area so the housing price will likely be a minimum of $800k-$1mil.  I know that is above the 2.5-3x annual salary (not including bonuses.  I don’t like counting bonuses as they may fluctuate wildly).  Likely I think we are 3-5 years out from buying a house and depending on prices still may not be able to.  We plan to contribute 100% of any bonuses we get to the house fund.  Where is a good place to park this money?  I can continue to contribute $20k to I-bonds, but what about above that?  Just an online savings account?  Or is the time frame far enough that bond funds (which concern me with likely rising interest rate) or other investments become more practical?

2) We’d like to retire by around 65, pay for our kids colleges (public school), and hopefully buy a house.  All of those savings goals compete with each other.  If my wife stays at her current job until our kids get into college they’ll foot $23k a year (in today’s dollars) for tuition (obviously not something we can count on).  Are we allocating appropriate amounts for each goal?  I’ve used some online calculators and it seems we are on track, but not entirely sure.  Should we talk with a financial advisor?  I know the typical Reddit advice is no, but would a fee only advisor be helpful?

3) Are our entertainment / groceries / personal fund expenses way too high?  Compared to a lot of you I know they are on the high side.  I don’t think we live “lavishly” but I do think daily purchases nickel and dime us a bit.  We’ve tried trimming them down, but haven’t been very successful in the past.

4) We could pay off my wife’s car with some of the money from I-bonds.  The I-bond interest rate is 1.48% which is a little lower than car interest rate.  The savings in interest would be relatively small, and my gut instinct is to keep the cash.

5) What should we do with wife’s 401(k) from past employer.  I don’t think the plan is especially great, so I’m thinking of rolling it into an IRA or possibly her current employer’s 401(k) depending on plan offerings.

6) Any other global suggestions?",finance,1423347179
personalfinance,[16] How can I start making money via programming?,"Hi all. 

I'd like to start off with saying thanks to all of you for helping people on reddit in your free time and it intrigues me (is that the right word? Amazes me) how one can alter someone else's life (for the better) by purely text communication with no obligation to actually help. Seriously, I tip my fedora to you. 

Anyway, a bit of lore (brace yourself) :

I am currently doing my GCSE's (not sure what the American equivalent is) with the humanities subject history and two optional subjects media studies and computer science. I am finishing these in about 5 months. I don't know if this will be helpful to you but I'll just leave it here just in case. 

As for my programing skills they are fairly limited in terms of range, but I am trying to perfect one language and then move on to the next when I am proficient with the former. The language I am doing is Java. I have learned the rudiments of the language as well as working with Swing, graphics classes and am learning the API lwjgl ( http://www.lwjgl.org/) in order to bound Open GL in java (3d graphics engine) . I am continuously expanding my knowledge of java, my next goal being networking. 

I know nothing about finances. I have a credit card from Barclay's (a British bank) but that's about it. 

And this is my problem/query. How can I start working with this rudimentary programming knowledge? How would I find a ""job"", if one with these specifications even exists? Where would you suggest I should start because this seems really daunting to me. Any pointers would be really appreciated.

personalfinance,PSA: IRS References for Tax-related ID Theft Issues,"Tax-related identity theft occurs when someone uses your stolen social security number to file a tax return claiming a fraudulent refund. The IRS combats tax-related identity theft with an aggressive strategy of prevention, detection and victim assistance. We are making progress against this crime, but it remains one of our highest priorities. And, if you become a victim, we are committed to helping you resolve your case as quickly as possible.

Generally, an identity thief will use your SSN to file a false return early in the year. You may be unaware you are a victim until you try to file your taxes and learn one already has been filed using your SSN.

Be alert to possible identity theft if you receive an IRS notice or letter that states that:

* More than one tax return was filed using your SSN;

* You owe additional tax, refund offset or have had collection actions taken against you for a year you did not file a tax return;

* IRS records indicate you received wages from an employer unknown to you.

Steps to take if you become a victim

* File a report with the local police.

* File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at www.identitytheft.gov or the FTC Identity Theft Hotline at 1-877-438-4338 or TTY 1-866-653-4261.

* Contact one of the three major credit bureaus to place a ‘fraud alert’ on your credit records:

*       Equifax, www.Equifax.com, 1-800-525-6285

*       Experian, www.Experian.com, 1-888-397-3742

*       TransUnion, www.TransUnion.com, 1-800-680-7289

* Close any accounts opened without your permission or tampered with.

If your SSN is compromised and you know or suspect you are a victim of tax-related identity theft, take these additional steps:

* Respond immediately to any IRS notice; call the number provided on the notice.

* Complete IRS [Form 14039](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf),  *Identity Theft Affidavit*. Use a fillable form at IRS.gov, print, then mail or fax according to instructions.

* Continue to pay your taxes and file your tax return, even if you must do so by paper.

The general timeframe for resolution of a tax-related ID theft case is 180 days from receipt of the valid return or notice response, Form 14039, and required documentation.

personalfinance,Help me save my mom financially,"I've been reading this sub for a year and a half or so and thanks to all you wonderful people I'm very financially literate. I'm graduating college in May with about $20,000 in loans and $5000 in CC debt (that I took out when I was ignorant), I'm going to start my job right away at a phenomenal company for $65,000 (with tons of promotion potential) and have a plan to aggressively pay off my debts within 2 years so I can start saving.

I was inspired to do it by my parents' financial collapse. My dad was the main breadwinner but had a string of unemployments and became an alcoholic asshole back in 2008. My mom was financially clueless. He lost his last job in 2010 and just kept pretending everything was fine and putting stuff on credit cards. She finally got a better job and moved out in September and wants to get divorced. However, they both have refused to show me any financial info for a year. It kept getting more and more dire sounding and I finally convinced her to show me their finances. I pulled her credit report and it was bad but not terrible. I pulled my Dad's report to get the full picture and it's worse than I imagined. I think I put everything together from opening dozens of unpaid bills and reading the reports.

Here's the breakdown:

Credit Cards:

* 13 total credit cards (5 just on her report, 4 just on his report, 3 on both reports. Don't know what this means legally)
* 5 on time, 7 late to varying degrees, 1 in collections
* Total balances just under $120,000 mostly at pretty high interest rates. The minimum payments I could find add up to $2,589 a month.
* ""Past due"" balance of about $28,000
* Looks like about $15,000 in interest accruing per year.

Loans:

* Two federal PLUS loans
* $23,000 is the remainder of a $28,000 loan in my dad's name he took out for me my freshman year at another school. I didn't have a clue about finances at this point and was convinced to ""follow my dreams"" to a school I couldn't afford.
*$26,000 in my mom's name for my sister's 2 years of school so far. 

That gives a total debt figure around $168,000 for my parents.

Real Estate:

* Parents are working to sell the house. Zillow/Trulia give it a range from $819k-$980k. Realtor will be listing it at the end of the month for $925k.
* Outstanding mortgage amount of $647k, leaving net range of 178k-333k after the sale. $3300 monthly payment
* House is big and fairly nice but run down due to my dad trashing it a bit the past few months. Highly desirable neighborhood, suburbs of a major city, long walk/short bike to subway system or walking to buses, great schools, all that stuff. Might be able to go up over $1M in a bidding war but I honestly have no idea.

* Retirement savings: still haven't seen this, sounds like my dad has blown most if not all of whatever he had in 401ks/IRAs, Mom has some account with TIAA CREF for $36k but I'm not even sure what it is.

So here's the deal right now. My dad is still useless and working odd jobs to make a few bucks but all the credit card statements have items from the liquor store. She's paying about $2600 with utilities for the apartment (shared with my 14yo brother) IN ADDITION to the $3300 mortgage. She was paying me $1050 a month for rent/utilities/food up until last month when I really started to realize how bad it was and got a private loan to cover my expenses until I start getting paid at my job.

I was knowledgeable enough to put together the full picture of the state of her/their finances but I have no idea what to tell her to do next. This stuff is way above my head. 

I have a bunch of questions, I don't even know where to start and I realize most of you couldn't answer, so I need help **figuring out who she needs to talk to to handle this whole situation.**

* She has a few free divorce lawyer options through her EAP, should I suggest she work with one of them?
* Will these debts all be counted 50/50 since they're married? Is there a chance to change the balance somewhat towards my dad since there's evidence of his substance abuse history and unemployment? (I honestly could care less what happens to him at this point, he's made no effort in the past 6-7 years to do anything positive)
* What should she do in the short term before the house sells since on about $4400 take home per month she is already adding to debt just after paying the rent and the mortgage?
* Separately have her talk to a (free) financial counselor through her job or credit union?
* Sell house first and settle split during divorce or divorce first and then force sale of the house?

Fingers crossed that the house sale will cover the debts but the more she canAppreciate anyone who made it through the whole thing and anyone who can offer advice.

I am considering buying my first house this year.

If I wait another 8 to 12 months, I could probably have enough for a 20% down payment (but I would rather not wait). I have been living in a one room studio apartment for the last 4 years while paying off my student loans.

My current rent is $800 per month and I'm looking at houses in the $100k to $150k range. Is there anything fundamentally wrong with the strategy of buying with about 10% down and paying extra throughout the first year to build my equity up to 20% and get out of PMI? Are there any other disadvantageous to a sub-20% down payment other than PMI and a potentially higher interest rate?

I live in Portland, Oregon.  It is a fast growing city with a very young population going through a real estate bonanza. 

I have a decent career-oriented job but I'm not going to make it rich with a big salary or bonus.   I rent a room in a nice 3-bedroom house for $515 a month and put more than 50% of my salary in retirement fund stocks.

My coworkers are all getting on the 'buy a home' bandwagon and the market sounds crazy.  There is no inventory and houses are being sold for 10-40% above list prices.  

I think this is fueled for the most part by low interest rates allowing people to borrow more money while keeping a monthly payment in line with the lenders rules.  

The rental market is also suffering inflation.  If I shopped for a new room to rent it prices are almost 50% higher.  I am worried that I am going to get gentrified out of my city in 10 years because real estate (renting and buying) seems to be outpacing my salary and investment returns.

I don't think there is enough money coming into to the Portland economy to fuel a real estate crisis as what we see in San Francisco and New York City.  I don't think the inflation is sustainable and I think once interest rates increase prices are going to stabilize to a normal inflation rate (3% a year?).

I'm a bit confused on where to place my money.

This is essentially an I have ""X"" amount of money and where do I put it type of question but the trouble I've been having is where exactly to put it.  I'm trying to set up savings for the following:  1. Emergency Fund 2. Mortgage 3. Car, 4. Entertainment(trips,computer,games,etc) 5. Retirement.

Now to give a little bit of background information.  I just recently joined the military and opened a saving/checking account with Navy Federal, and have an older BofA checking and credit card. I've already visted a financial specialist here at my current base and set a budget and a % for my TSP but she couldnt really help me with where to put my savings. I ended up speaking to someone at Navy Federal and told them what I wanted to do and they suggested opening up 3 accounts with them. The first is a 1yr CD that has a 3k max at 3% for the emergency, the second is another 1yr CD that is at .95% but has no max for the mortgage and then the 3rd is a MM savings account for main savings account where I would stick everything else in.

Where the confusion comes in for me is if I should just go with what is currently laid out or if there are better options. I've browsed through some old posts and read about some CD's around 1.5% or 2% plus, should I be looking for these? And should I have my main banking account be the same bank where I keep my CD's and credit cards?

My main goal or idea I have is to set a savings for 3-5+ years for my mortgage, a 1-2year savings for a car, and 3-6month savings account for when I want to go on trips or buy something expensive in the 1-3k range and just live out of my credit card(havent choosen one yet but may go with the Navy federal cashrewards).

The way they determined salary,as they told me, was they took the average employees earnings of the previous two years. For me though, since I have only been working at this company for about 7 months, they had told me they took what I would have made over the year and that was my salary. The number they came up with, though, was much lower than what I calculated it out to be. It is well known that we are understaffed at our position, and everyone works about 5-10 hours of overtime a week. 

Since I disagree with the number put forth in front of me, I am planning on going into HR on Monday (which is when we start getting paid salary) and plead my case. For somebackgroung, I was making $30/hr, which is a base salary of $62,400, but with the average amount of overtime I was working, I calculated that I would make a little over $78,000. What they offered me was $68,500.

My question to you all is, since I am not accepting the salary that they had provided to me, should I still go into work on Monday, or should I wait until I talk with HR? Also, how should I go about negotiating this? Being straight out of college, I have little experience negotiating pay. I know my numbers are correct and that I would average the $78,000, but I am unsure they would be willing to pay that much on a salary basis.

personalfinance,Refinancing student loan questions,"Hey there PF.

I graduated with a BS degree last August and have  been making the minimum payments on accruing interest since I got the loan. It was initially for $20,000 but with interest accruing on it at 6.74%, I currently owe almost $22,000 in total.

It's been 'in grace' since I graduated, but repayment is expected to start in March.

My question is, if I wanted to refinance it for a different interest rate (looks like mid 5% range right now), what would be more effective: getting a longer term refinance with lower monthly payment, and paying about $1000 a month towards it, or getting a shorter term refinance with higher monthly, but still paying about $1000 a month. If it was a longer term, the monthly is less so wouldn't the difference knock the overall loan down more than  a higher monthly at shorter term?

personalfinance,Being taxed on health insurance through Domestic Partner's employer. Seeking advice for resolving amount.,"I'm insured as a Domestic Partner through my roommate's employer. When the enrollment opportunity came up, we thought it would be a less expensive alternative to me being insured through my employer (her employer pays 100%, mine would be several hundred out of my paycheck each month). We knew that she would be taxed for the expense of my health coverage and at the time she estimated her tax increase/reduce in take-home would be about $50/mo. So I've been paying her $50/mo and her employer has been keeping me insured.

She just received her W-2 for 2014 and it lists that the total employer-paid benefits for my insurance alone are ~$9K on which she has been taxed at ~25% (state and fed). So she has paid ~$2.2K in taxes this year to keep me insured (~$187/mo, considerably more than the $50/mo she estimated). Considering her salary is only about $65K/yr, insuring me significantly increases her taxable income (over 13%).

I don't know how she missed such a significant reduction in her paychecks. I don't look at her pay stubs or know anything about her earnings so it wasn't my place to examine. But she has been taxed on the employee benefit(s) all year so the money is paid.

Here's where my terrible sense of taxes &amp; personal finance comes in: I have no idea what the fair thing to do is in this situation. Should I just straight up pay her the ~$2.2K/yr that she's being taxed for my insurance? What else would impact this number as far as taxable income, tax bracket, refunds, etc. (I'm clueless on these things). Assuming she gets a tax refund, would that reduce the amount I owe her by a small percentage (or rather, would part of that refund by mine)?

I don't mind paying what I owe, but I'd like to know that what I'm paying is actually the amount I should be paying (hard to tell since it's her being taxed).

On a related note: Should I consider switching to my employer's health plan? It's a small business so I'd have a higher monthly out-of-paycheck expense but at least it would be counted as my income and I'd be taxed on it on my terms.

personalfinance,Mortgage transfer after my dad passed away. Need advice on what to do.,"Sorry for the wall of text, but the back story is important. My dad passed away last month and the house that my mom lives in was under my dad's name. He did not leave a will. Before the mortgage crisis, both my parents were on the mortgage, but they declared bankruptcy, and took my mom off of the mortgage, leaving my dad as the sole owner.

My mom does not have a job, and her credit score is non-existent. I could pay for the mortgage, but really do not the house under my name. Since they declared bankruptcy before, if we stop paying, we would just be kicked out of the place, and the bank would take the property. Now we are faced with a couple of hard questions. Will the bank give my mom the property given her credit score and lack of income?

*It is a 30 year mortgage with about 20 years left.

*Interest Bearing principal balance: 180,000

*Non-interest bearing principal balance- 2,615

*Gross unpaid balance 185,000

*Escrow Balance: 2,350

*Interest Rate: 3.04. Adjustable Rate

* It was a 5/1 ARM and is now adjustable. The property is in Illinois, and my mom was not on the title. 

The current monthly payment is about $1,400, and due to the Mortgage modification my parents agreed on, the interest rate will increase over the next couple of years. Another question is if this property is worth keeping. I have some savings, and could invest about 30k, but not sure if this will decrease the monthly payments or just put a dent in the years to pay. We really have a choice to walk away from the property and let the bank keep it, but since we already put so much money into it, is it worth paying it off and keeping it? Please, if you have any experience with a similar situation, let me what I should do. Thank you for any input, or if I need to provide any other info.",finance,1423433012

personalfinance,Does my investing/savings strategy make sense?,"Hi all! So I'll be starting my first job out of college in a few months making between 60k - 70k, with no debt. I currently have about 11k between my checking, savings and brokerage account.

My plan when I start is to max out my 401(k) contribution to get the maximum employer match (they match 50% up to 4%, so I will contribute 8% to my 401(k) which they will then contribute 4% for a total of 12% annual 401(k) contributions, I will most likely opt for a Roth 401(k) if available).

In addition to the employer match on the 401(k) they will contribute 3% (regardless of whether or not I contribute) to another savings plan. I plan on not contributing anything to that plan since the amount the employer contributes does not change based on my input. So altogether each year 15% of my salary will go towards retirement.

I plan on having enough money in my savings account (currently with Discover 0.9% interest rate -_-) to cover 6 months worth of bills, and my checking will have whatever money is needed to cover my bills (I pay 99% of everything on a CC and pay in full each month).

Since interest rates blow on savings accounts my plan is to essentially funnel money into a diversified portfolio of mutual funds (No-Load, No Transaction Fees), so it will have higher returns (hopefully *crosses fingers*) than just sitting it in a savings account, but still allow me to access the money if I want/need without the penalty of pulling from a 401(k) for example.

After lurking on this subreddit for sometime, I've gotten plenty of insight into what my next steps may be as a recent college graduate under a burdensome amount of debt, like so many others here.

As a result, I was hoping to post my current situation and status to see if there is any direction that I may have missed. At the same time, I hope to be an extra resource for any other student-loan-indebted grad that's searching for help in the future (as many of you have done for me :D) Hopefully my situation could help others figure out their financial path down the road. 

Current background: Unmarried male living with his parents in his early 20s. I have around ~100k in student loans that I am hoping to tackle with a gross income of about ~65k. At the moment, my main monthly expenses are 

~$1100 towards student loans
~$900 I quickpay to my parents to help with their mortgage

(Luckily my job helps pay for a lot of the other expenses most have to deal with (phone, internet, transportation). I know this is not nearly as much as others have to deal with and I'm tremendously grateful for it...) 

Attached below is a snapshot of all my student loans, some federal, some private. The highest interest rate being 10.38% with a $12421 balance.

After all is said and done I should have roughly $1000 left over each month that I'm directing towards the buffer, personal expenses, and the loans with the highest interest rates. 

I've talked to my friends, families, and coworkers and have considered consolidating my loans (my federal ones especially) and other directions I could take. Are there any options I am not accounting for? Is there something more effective I could be doing to help eliminate my loans?

personalfinance,Is it even worth saving for retirement right now?,"I finally got a decent paying job not too long ago after graduating with almost $72,000 in student loan debt. Thankfully, they're all government loans - nothing's private - and I have no other debt. Also, without I currently have an emergency fund to last me for at least six months (not including any unemployment benefits I may be eligible for) should I lose my job. Those funds are in an Ally savings account earning 0.99% interest.

**My primary question is this: with over $12/day of interest being tacked onto my student loans, is it even worth it trying to save for retirement at the moment? Or will be retirement savings likely be negated by what I have to pay towards student loans?**  I've tried multiple times trying to figure this out, but I can't wrap my head around the math and am overwhelmed by the billion possibilities. The 401k plan that my employer offers doesn't do any matching, so there's not much of an incentive to save via those means. There is a pension plan, but I don't know a single detail about it other than I can't do anything with it until I've worked with them for at least three years (I'm working on getting more info).

My net pay is $1,447 biweekly and my expenses, including rent, utilities, personal/entertainment spending and groceries is about $1,000-$1,200 per month. I want to start saving up for a home as well so that, once a down payment is made, I'll still only be paying up to $700/mo for a mortgage towards ownership rather than feeling like I'm throwing money away for temporary shelter (i.e. rent). I live in Chicago, so the cost of renting is higher than buying the type of home I'd like to eventually own in the area I'd like to own it in. 

I know there are income-based repayment plans for student loans, however I'll end up paying even more over a longer period of time for them. I feel like my best bet is going with the standard plan and instead of paying the minimum $700-something per month, pay $1,000/mo instead so that I pay less over the long run and pay them off sooner.

I am about to hit my 30th birthday. My wife is 29.


Loans:

     Student: 6300 (3.5 percent)

     Car: 3500 (2.9 percent)

     Personal Family Loan: 2600 (0 percent)

     Mortgage: 252,700 (at 2.7 interest rate set for four more years*)


Assets:

     Condo: 360,000 appraised (107,300 equity considering mortgage above)

     09 Camry (Fully own)

     11 Honda Insight (Car Loan above)

     20,000 dollars liquid

Credit balances paid off full every month.

We are normally able to save about 2500 per month but due to our current aggressive loan pay off stance have been saving about 500 per month. We intend to go back to saving over 3000 per month after loans have been paid off.

*It is our goal to purchase a home within 4 years (which is why we refinanced our condo to a, at the time, 5 year adjustable rate mortgage to take advantage of the lower interest rate) due to incoming kids and the inevitable outgrowing of our small 2 bedroom condo. We obviously intend to sell the condo to help pay for the down payment of the home.

We should note that we live in Southern California so house prices here are INSANE (could be worse though, I guess). Our (achievable...I think...) dream home is 700k (currently, who knows what the next few years will bring) so that makes a 20 percent down payment of 140k. With our home equity along with loan free savings, we think we can achieve that.

Of course, 700k is the top of the top of our price range. Realistically, we're probably looking at 550k though 650k I'd say.

We are currently attacking the student loan and car loan hard to prepare for the upcoming home purchase (is this even the right mentality?) Should we focus instead on saving up as much cash as possible for the biggest down payment we could muster? Or should we pay off the loans to qualify for a higher mortgage?

Any other general advice would be welcomed. Thanks!",finance,1423454628

personalfinance,"Is it irresponsible to take out a car loan in my situation? A couple questions, also...","TL;DR &amp; questions at the bottom.

Background info:  I have a job that I love, with a great mentor, and the opportunity to make a lot of money someday.  I do not want to leave my job, but it is quite the commute from my house.  I spend $400+ a month on gas driving to/from work (and that's using the recently low gas prices that will eventually go up).  That doesn't really count any of my extra driving during my free time.  

My current vehicle:  2002 Jeep Liberty 4wd.  I get about 17-18 mpg.  This *could* be a money trap, but at this point I've quit making any repairs that don't effect the vehicle's ability to get from point A to B legally.  Originally, I bought it when I was in school and didn't have a real commute.  I loved it for 4wd, power options, and basically it just felt a lot nicer than my first car (chevy cavalier), so I didn't mind sacrificing the mpg's.  At this point, so many things are broke on it (AC/Heater, electrical issues, etc.) that I feel like I'm not getting any of the creature comforts out of the vehicle that I bought it for.

There is no reason for me to be spending so much on gas for a vehicle that I don't enjoy anymore.  

I don't have much savings, and I know I wouldn't get much for my Jeep, so i may have about $4000 to put down on a used car.  **I'm sure this is a PF no-no, but I do want to buy a car that gets me excited, and not something that only gets me from A-&gt;B economically.**  

I pretty much already made up my mind on a Audi A3 TDI.  Depending on the year/mileage, I think I can get one for 15-16k or less.  They get 40mpg highway, which is 90% of my drive.  After I take out the down payment &amp; trade-in, I'd be financing 11-12K.  I've only ever bough my cars free &amp; clear, and never had an auto loan so I don't know what the interest rate would be, but I have a credit score of 757 (I'm an LO and so is my mother, so we pulled my credit and that number is 100% accurate).  I'm thinking that if I got a 40mpg vehicle, and then figured on a $200 car payment, then I would actually be saving money.

**TL;DR- Currently own my shitty-mpg vehicle free &amp; clear, but spend $400+ a month on gas.  Dependability is slowly on the decline.  Might get a 30-40mpg vehicle for a car payment of $200 or less a month, and the new payment + gas should be cheaper than what I pay for just gas right now.**",finance,1423460532

personalfinance,Married filing jointly vs. separately with student loans,"I've already kind of made up my mind to file married but separately, but I was hoping maybe someone could look at my situation and give me their opinion. 

I'm married. my AGI if I file 'married but separate is $44,000.  If I do this I'm looking at a federal tax return of around $1,400.  My wife doesn't make really all that much. If we file jointly our AGI goes to $47,000, but then we're looking at a tax return of $3,100

The issue that gives me pause is our student loan situation.  I have $160,000 in debt, I'm on IBR and I'm in the PSLF making payments of $220 a month. My wife has $2000 of student loans that she is paying off on her own.  So far I've insisted on us having separate finances because I didn't want to attach her to any of my debt. I don't want my loan debt to become *our* loan debt.  I also don't want her (albeit small) income to make my monthly IBR payments any higher. So ever since we've been married we've filed married but separate.

My question is do you think I'm leaving money on the table by filing separately?  I feel like I'm in a good place with this IBR/PSLF repayment schedule, and I don't want to screw it up just for the sake of getting an extra $1,600 on my tax return.

I've used the IRS repayment calculator and I think I might be looking at an increase of $35.00 a month on my payments if I file jointly, which would mean a $420 increase in payments over the course of a year measured against the extra $1,600 from the return. So mathematically it might make sense to file jointly but I don't want to because I'm paranoid that doing so will affect my student loan repayments in a way that I have no way of predicting.

I know it's all on me and my wife to make this decision but I really am interested in hearing any opinions people might have.",finance,1423465420
personalfinance,Give us your Billions America: H&amp;R block and others like it scams?,"So I was reading the post that made it to the front page in the past couple of days. The one about how H&amp;R Block was charging this redditor 300$ for his taxes to be filed. 

I myself visited have visited H&amp;R Block as well and found that my taxes would be 181$ to be filed by them for both state and federal.... I only made $32k... Even with my wonderful student loan interest, it doesn't help much to getting a lot back. (btw: super great they told me it helps with my return, etc...) Coincidentally I made a future time and date to come back and finish saying I needed to get additional information about my student loan interest to hopefully get more back. All in all the gut feeling and this front page post from /r/personalfinance made me start thinking... Do I need to really go to H&amp;R Block?

So I did some light researching after reading the comments, talking to friends who have accountant family members, and asking others what their plans are or have done in the past years to get their taxes done. 

I found that generally $60k-$100k/year are in the tax group of required to file 1099 forms. I also found if you file 1099 form there's 3 you need to file... Not sure if applies to electronic self service file programs. (TurboTax and the like) Also found that the mods for /r/personalfinance are tax and question answering hero's.... Commenting advice early on as comments to the post were fresh. But now those comments have seemingly disappeared. I may be a bit new to reddit... Maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist. But I doubt big companies that provide the service of filing your taxes, that charge you exuberant amounts of your own hard earned cash, and that advertise as your friends with old seeming polite old men offering you billions... really want you and I to know the truth. 

So seriously... Mods, redditors, and accountant friends of redditors.... DO I REALLY NEED TO GO TO H&amp;R BLOCK or is it a scam? ($32k I made last year... $75k student loan debt... $7k shitty car loan left....)

The reason I ask through a post is because (assumably: 15% of Americans fit in my same tax bracket, but I am 27 years old and commonly browse reddit. Therefore I conclude roughly 1/3-2/3 of all redditors fit in my same tax bracket and can benefit from the hopefully solid responses as it is early tax season) Also the power of the social media has empowered us to become enlightened swiftly and promptly. 

Mods, Redditors, tax paying/experienced tax preparers, Americans...give me and us some solid advice? Please? and thank you.

Edit: So the main reason I was scared to file myself, was because my parents were audited by the IRS about 6 years ago. When that happened it was bad, I do not remember exact numbers and it is a really sore subject with them. But because of it my parents were forced to claim bankruptcy on top of the fact my step dad (the money maker) was unemployed/between contracts when the audit hit. I saw how bad an audit could be and have been terrified ever since. 

Also it just seems like tax services like H&amp;R Block, more specifically Liberty Tax (the ones with a near homeless person holding a sign and wearing a Statue of Liberty costume that looks like it was purchased from the dollar store) are sometimes a scam because it seems like they take advantage of poorly informed saps such as myself.

Firstly this is a family run business, so paychecks and finances are done by the owners hand and his wife. 
My first TWO pay stubs had another employees name, address, phone number, and SSN (uncensored).  Obvious WTF moments. If it weren't for me telling said employee, she wouldn't have known. The physical pay CHECKS had my name and correct numbers but the stubs were incorrect. 

Fast forward to now. Tax season. Well I get my W-2 and it says a whooping $362 was earned by me in 2014 over the course of 4 months (actual number should be about $1600).  I confront him about it, ask other employees to check their forms and gather all my pay stubs. 
His reply today was ""oh, my tax guy wrote a W-2 for one of those original two checks that were goofed. Give me your pay stubs... so I don't have to do an amended w-2"" 
If its any worth anything, he didn't charge me a penny for state or federal tax over the last few months either.

Sounds fishy to me, what do you all think? What options do I have? Is any of this ""okay""?

personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to put our down payment savings into a Roth IRA?,"Been thinking about our options lately and I thought I'd go to you smart people for advice.  My wife and I have been saving for a down payment on a house for about 2.5 years now.  So far we have $60k saved up, but because homes within a 30 minute commute of our work/families are currently starting at about $650k, we're hoping to save up another $60-$80k for a down payment in the next 2-4 years.  Hopefully by then we'll be ready to purchase a home.

We're currently keeping our down payment savings in a few checking accounts at our credit union which return 1.36% interest.  We're fine keeping our money in the checking accounts since they’re secure and liquid, but sometimes I wonder if we can do more with our money.  I know the stock market is too risky for short-term investing, and I believe CD's return less than our checking account's interest rate, but what about opening a Roth IRA for each of us?  Neither of us have one and I've always been taught that starting a Roth early is one of the best ways to save for retirement.

Our question is, considering our primary goal is to buy a home in the next 2-4 years, would it be a bad idea to max out on contributions towards a Roth IRA for both of us using our down payment savings? We could each put $11k into a Roth this year ($5.5k for 2014 and $5.5k for 2015) and $5.5k each following year until we're ready to buy a home.  I know this may sound like a dumb idea, considering we're already getting 1.36% in a risk free, liquid account, and we'll need the cash in less than 5 years, but I was thinking putting the money into a Roth may have the following advantages:

* We, and especially my wife, would be starting retirement accounts which we've been wanting to do for a long time
* As far as I'm aware, we can withdraw the money we contributed to our Roths at any time, and we can each withdraw up to $10k of our gains if it's towards the purchase of our first home
* In the case that in the next 2-4 years, one of the following happens:
 * our incomes increase
 * home prices decrease
 * we decide to move to a cheaper market or buy a condo
 * we've saved more than anticipated
 * we decide to put less than 20% down
 * for some reason we decide to hold off a little longer on buying a home
    
    or some combination of these situations, we may not have to completely empty out our Roth contributions to come up with a down payment. We'd then have money in our Roths contributing towards our retirement that we wouldn't have had otherwise.

For these reasons, I think it may be a good idea to open and max out our Roths each year.  Am I missing something though?  Why doesn’t everyone put their down payment savings into a Roth?  I'm just now starting to learn about finance, and this sub has been lots of help, so I thought I'd ask your opinions before making this move.  What do you think?

Also, if we decide to put our money into Roths, we wouldn't want very much risk of losing that money since it's really our down payment savings.  We'd probably put the money into some of the most conservative investments available.  Any advice on what some of the more conservative investment options are (we're thinking of opening our Roths with Vanguard), what their expected return is, and a guess at how much risk there is of them losing money over the next 2-4 years?  Even if our safe investment option returns about the same as our checking account, or a bit less, I figure it's still worth putting that money in the Roth if there isn’t any significant risk of a loss.

Just in case it matters, here's our current retirement situation:  We're both in our late mid 20's.  She has no money in any kind of retirement account (she’s working; her employer isn’t offering any sort of retirement at this time, but they should be soon). I'm in a pension plan through my employer.  If I stay with them throughout my career, I can retire at age 60 with 100% of my final salary for life, with a COLA each year.  My employer (government entity in a prosperous area) isn't going anywhere and I see the likelihood of me working here throughout my career as very high.  While I don't foresee any risk of my pension defaulting, and I hope that 100% of my final salary at age 60 would be enough to support my wife and I at that time, we'd like to start putting additional money away towards retirement.  It's just that, at this time, saving for a down payment on a home is our primary financial goal.  Once we achieve our goal of purchasing a home, I figure we can dump as much money as possible into IRA's/401k's.

**TL;DR:** Wife and I saving up for a down payment on a house.  Have about $60k now, trying to get to about $120-$140k in the next 2-4 years.  Would it be a bad idea to open Roth IRA’s with our down payment savings, max out our contributions each year while putting our money into conservative investments, and then withdraw what we need from our Roths when we’re ready to buy a home?  If you think it’s a good idea, any advice on what types of conservative investments we should put our money in?",finance,1423483293

personalfinance,I am in the 1% of student loans,"TL:DR- 130k student loan debt, no hope for better job, kid on the way, going to be single income family, is bankruptcy a viable option?

I went to a private college, I thought it would be great on my resume and open a lot of doors for me. Put I was a stupid 18 year old who didn't know any better. I got a degree in something I love, art, which I know many of you will troll on and on about. But the fact is I was always told to get a degree in something you love, so I followed that advice. The school I went to was a liberal arts college, so I did not just study art, I also minored in sociology.

Those four years left me with an estimated 100k in students loan debt from both federal and private loans. 

After college I decided to put personal interest before professional and moved back home (western Maryland) so that my girlfriend of 5 years (at the time) and I could get married. We both had jobs and both bought cars. We also took out a credit card to pay for a rather cheap wedding. 

I decided to go back to school for a little while and take some graphic design courses. I had planned to pay for it out of pocket, but once we moved into our own place, that became impossible.

I was employed at a warehouse making $30,000 a year ($14/hour with solid 40 hour weeks). That warehouse closed which put me on unemployment for a month until I found another warehouse job that pays exactly the same. Having money to pay for a roof over my head, food on the table, and gas in my car is not an issue.

Keeping personal priorities in mind my wife and I are expecting our first child in a few months. This has unfortunately put her out of work until after maternity leave. 

We have considered cutting back to one car so that she can stay home with our son (this saves money on child care and also reduces insurance, gas, and removes a car payment from out bills).

Back to the issue at hand. My students loans Have been racking up interest and now sit at comfy $130k. I all but exhausted my forbearance. Add the 11k credit card and 10k left on my car and 15k on hers, our debit to income ratio is shot.

I have been job hunting for something better ever sense I left school, but there just isn't anything that pays more 35k in my area for someone my age with no experience besides warehouse.

So with a mountain of debt, a family to take care of, and no better job opportunities in site I see no hope of ever tackling my student loans. I know bankruptcy is near impossible, but is it something I should look into and if so, would I really have a chance of bringing my owed debt down to a manageable amount?

&gt;**Ignore “expert” stock picks.** The stocks that Wall Street experts like most generally fare no better than those they like least—or stocks picked at random.

&gt;**Keep it simple.** Complicated financial strategies and investments are mostly designed to enrich managers and salesmen. A simple, diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, rebalanced yearly, will do just fine—if not better.

&gt;**Buy individual stocks only as a gamble.** Never buy fashionable investments.

&gt;**Put most of your long-term portfolio into equities.** While equities are volatile, they generally produce the best long-term returns—typically about 4% to 5% a year above inflation. But remember to hang on when they plummet.

&gt;**Invest globally, not just in the U.S.** Foreign stock markets, in the aggregate, are no riskier than U.S. markets and offer terrific diversification.

&gt;**Buy Treasurys, too:** In addition to stocks, own some long-term Treasury bonds and some Treasury inflation-protected securities. These are likely to hold their value, or even go up, when stocks crash.

&gt;**Never buy a lottery ticket.** The lottery runs a profit, which means the players run a loss. And a study once found that the people who won ended up no happier than those who lost.

&gt;**Know thyself.** Don’t pursue complex financial or tax strategies if you’re not a details person. Cut up your credit cards if you’re a shopaholic. Invest more conservatively if you’re apt to panic in a crisis.

&gt;**Buy high-deductible home and car insurance.** It’ll save you money. Insurance is necessary, but is generally expensive.

&gt;**Protect yourself from disaster.** Have disability insurance, either through work or directly. Buy term life insurance to cover dependents if you fall under a bus.

&gt;**Save early, save often.** Time and patience are the investor’s best friends. Invest a dollar for 10 years at 4% and you’ll have $1.50. Invest it for 40 years and you’ll have nearly $5.

&gt;**Use those free shelters.** Contribute as much as possible to your company’s 401(k) plan or equivalent (such as 403(b) or 457), and at least enough to get the company match. If you can, contribute to individual retirement accounts for yourself, and a nonworking spouse, as well.

&gt;**Make the most of what you have.** Don’t pin too much hope on the next pay raise or stock windfall. The more we have, the more we want. Psychologists call this the “hedonic treadmill.” The only way to have enough is to master the art of being satisfied.

&gt;**Plan for a long life.** A third of your adult life could come after you’re 65. Try to pay off your mortgage, and save at least 10 times your annual salary, by the time you retire. Delay taking Social Security for as long as you can up to the age of 70, to maximize each monthly check.

&gt;**Don’t carry a balance from month to month unless you are planning to default and file for bankruptcy.** Card interest rates are extremely high—partially to account for the borrowers who will default. Make paying off that debt your overriding priority.

&gt;**Cut the waste.** There’s fat in every middle-class budget. Most cellular bills are too high. Most cable bills are too high. Most people waste too much money on their cars. Few habits bust the budget more than eating out regularly.

&gt;**Beware of buying your employer’s stock.** Your job there is probably financial exposure enough.

&gt;**Tune out advertising.** If you consider it all to be a pack of cynical lies designed to steal your money, that’s about right.

&gt;**Don’t spend money showing off.** Designer brands and “luxury” labels are created to overcharge the desperately insecure. They’ll mark you out as nouveau riche. Old-money families keep it down low.

&gt;**Protect your nest egg.** Don’t drain your retirement savings to pay for your child’s college education. Likewise, don’t empty your 401(k) or IRAs to start a business. You will be taxed and penalized on the withdrawals even if you lose the money. And so long as the money remains in those shelters, it’s protected from creditors.

&gt;**Teach your children about money.** Teach them early and often. No one else will, and they will have to make their own way.

&gt;**Value your money.** Work out how much you take home, after-tax, for each hour you work. And remember that number - especially when you shop.

&gt;**Share.** Finally, if you think giving to charities and good causes is the lowest-priority item in your entire budget each year, re-examine the budget.

I imagine this is preaching to the choir for most, if you're doing it right.",finance,1423506947
personalfinance,"Duel Residency, Avoiding Double Taxation.","This last summer I worked for the Feds In California, I was in California from May 15 to the end of October. I had state taxes taken out of my paychecks for California, even though I was a resident of Virginia. Virginia on the other hand requires me to pay taxes on income I made in other states while I was a resident of Virginia. (Im now actually a resident of West Virginia) Apparently California only will allow me to deduct the taxes I paid in Virginia if  im a dual resident. I did some research but im still foggy to what that would mean, dual residency that is. Should I declare residency for the time I was in CA?

I was able to pick up one job after being laid off. Mind, you I was still living on my own then. When I was laid off, I was broke. No emergency savings. I lived paycheck to paycheck. I put my rent, train tickets for job interviews (never saved receipts), food, etc. on my credit cards (I have two). I tried my hardest to nail my interviews, but I didn't. Once I maxed out my cards, I jumped the lease on my apartment and moved back in with my mom.

I became another 1099-misc worker. I made $910 from them. All of that went to my credit card debit. I have none of it left. I filed my federal and state taxes from TaxACT. Last year, I used TurboTax. I filed and was accepted before waiting for the form from the job I was laid off from. I thought I wouldn't get one because I was laid off. Naive me.

I made $14,118.00 from my laid off job. I have no money to my name and no money whatsoever to give the government. I'm going to have to pay to fix the form I think from TaxACT. Will I end up having to pay the government? 

Can I do anything to fix this for free? Is there anything I can do to make it so I don't have to pay? Do they even have anything for people who become unemployed, but didn't get unemployment because they were a 1099-misc worker?",finance,1423509340
personalfinance,"Company messed up my W4 withholdings, now I owe a lot of money to the IRS. Is there anything that I can do?","I'll first start off by saying that I know that, in the end, I am liable for the mistake made to my withholdings... but since I am not well versed in taxes and finance, I want to at least ask if there is anything that can be done to help me.

I provided my Federal and State W4s to my company when I started in July. In my W4s, I had my deductions (M, 0) and an additional flat fee for both Fed and State setup.  I reviewed the set-up in our payroll system and it appeared to be correct; however, after receiving my W2 and looking at past paystubs, it was deducting only the additional flat fee and not taking my deduction (M, 0) into account at all. Resulting in an IRS bill that is quite high.

Again, I know that I'm ultimately responsible... but wanted to at least ask the community to see if there is anything that can be done.  Thanks in advance for any help.



TL;DR - Company messed up my withholdings.  Is there anything that I can do to get help with what I now owe the IRS?

Edit: Want to clarify.  I know that I'm responsible for paying the IRS 100% of what is owed.  I'm trying to see if there is anything, besides a payment plan with the IRS, that can be done.  Since the company made the mistake, is there anything they are liable for.  I'm guessing no, but want to ask anyways.",finance,1423511042

personalfinance,Affordable Healthcare Act insurance plans + actual income = big taxes.,"When I signed my wife and myself up for health plans through healthcare.org last year, I was asked to give our salaries.  Working retail for an hourly wage, I asked the representative what the best way to estimate our salary would be seeing it varies considerably year to year depending on demand for our stores product.  She said I could give her the hourly rate and that would be good enough to establish our tax credit for our plans, even though I told her we are very busy in the winter season at work and work many hours of overtime - using 40 hours wasn't going to be accurate.  Still, she said that's the way they were collecting personal data.  Being the first year of the service, I didn't have prior experience or outside assistance available to verify this. 

Fast forward to tax time, and I'm currently being told the government way overpaid us for monthly credits on our healthcare plans, and that we need to pay in over $2500 in federal taxes since we made a higher amount in total income than we reported when signing up for plans.  While paying in $2500 might now seem like a huge deal, we would have been getting a ~$1000 return without the insurance portion calculated in.

I realize there really isn't anything we can do now in terms of remedying the way we reported our income to them (TIL - never trust a healthcare.org representative to give the best advice when reporting income), but I'm wondering this:

I have a small business I started this past year, and invested about $7000 of personal money into it.  So far, it's turned about $1500 profit.  This was to be expected as I had to purchase equipment to get the business started and I only started hiring our my services late in the year.  Originally, I was going to file the business separate from my personal taxes, but I'm wondering if filing them together might be beneficial to offset the amount I have to pay in as a result of the healthcare snafu?

finance,Obvious high interest rate option strategy,"When interest rates finally get to 4-5% (may take a long time) put options will become cheaper than calls via put call parity. Black Sholes option pricing doesn't take into account that high interest rate environments are actually prone to crashes more so than low rate environments. What you do is you put 95% of your cash in a savings account and use the 5% to buy weekly puts on inverse volatility ETFs (SVXY) or calls on VXX/UVXY or puts on any index fund.  These would be far out of the money options and you would only be able to allocate a little at a time each week. The $ in your savings account covers the losses from these tiny bets. Eventually the market will crash (as it always do when interest rates are high) and you will make a lot of $ that week. This is repeated until rates go back to 1%, at which point you're just better off buying the index fund.  If you have an overseas account you can do this method now because some overseas accounts pay 4% interest on US dollar deposits.",finance,1423512323
solar,Some questions about installing a 400A panel with &gt; 32 circuits to support an 8kw solar array and a ranch house.,"I'm working with a few electricians and friends, but I'm having some difficulty sorting all of the information into a comprehensive plan. Furthermore, there are a few different options and opinions going around. 

I'm in Canyon Country, CA and SoCal Edison is my utility provider.

1. I could probably make do with a 200A panel, but this restricts me to a less than 8kW solar array (I believe b/c of Edison rules and not technical limitations)

2. I currently have a 150A panel with 32 circuits being used

3. Can anyone recommend a 400A wall-mount panel for around $1,000? 400A main breakers seem hard to find, and it seems like most are being sold as a 200A main breaker and 200A sub-panel (sometimes not included).

4. Can anyone validate my understanding of a two-200A panel system? One panel would be the main breaker and one would be a sub-panel. I'd have to install a 40A breaker for each that gets fed 40A each from the solar array. The main breaker would go to the Edison line and the sub-panel would feed from the main breaker.

personalfinance,Financial Assessment/Suggestions,"Hello all,

I'm looking to improve on my current financial situation, set some good long-term goals, and just have a better idea of what I should be focusing on at this point in my life. I use Mint to track my spending and follow budgets. I'm 27, male, single, with no kids. Great credit score, 750+.

Here are my current debts and income:

Income: ~$52k per year in MI, USA.

Debts/significant expenses:

* ~$15k left in student loans: $260/month payments. This is split between a couple different Stafford loans right now, one is 6.3% (Federal Loan) the other is 6.55% (US Dept of Education loan). Both fixed rates.
* $6,500 left on Harley Davidson: $150/month payments (2.75%)
* $400/month for rent
* ~$200/month for car + bike insurance


Cash:

* $6,500 in savings
* ~$2,500 in 401k (I know I'm maxing my employer's contribution limits, I think overall I have allocated 6% of my income to contributions and employer matches up to 4% or something like that)

I only recently started actually using my savings account and following budgets. I used to just have everything in my checking but I realized I wasn't making any significant progress on savings, so I started sending $1,000 each month to my savings account and am not withdrawing or transferring from that at all. I feel comfortable with my current spending/saving level.

My only real goal for the next couple years is to change my living situation which I have not decided the direction I want to go yet. I'm currently living with a buddy (renting a room in his house). I'm happy with my current situation, but have aspirations to move out to my own place (either buying a house or condo). If I decide to purchase a house, I plan on having at least $5k set aside for emergency fund, and then have another $15k to use as down payment if necessary, and to purchase all the appliances/stuff I'll be needing.

So how can I best optimize my finances? I'd love to learn more about investing, but I'm not sure if I should start going down that route or if there is something else I should be focusing on right now. Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,[Credit] Would it be best to keep high interest credit cards and just not use them?,"My girlfriend and I are working on paying off all of our credit card debt. We are planning on using the avalanche method that I found in this subreddit. After laying out all of our credit card accounts (11 between the two of us) we realized just how much we were paying in interest every month.

We are tackling two of my credit card accounts that I started when I was 18 (the shitty things that get mailed to you because you are *pre-qualified!*). Thankfully they are very low limit cards (300-400) so we should be able to get them paid down fairly quickly. After looking more in-depth at the card accounts I realized that I am being charged monthly and yearly servicing fees on both cards. I am wondering if it would make sense to keep the cards and just not use them and pay only the service fees every month and just keep the balance at $0 or close the accounts when we pay them off. The only reason I would keep them is just because they are my two oldest credit accounts, and I know that that does factor into my overall credit. So here is some info about my situation:

Accounts I'm thinking about closing: 2

Number of accounts in total(just me): 11

Length of accounts: 8 years

Average age of all accounts: 3 years

Interest rate of the accounts: 35% (Yes, shitty mail offer cards that I jumped on when I was 18)

Monthly fees: Card 1: $8.25 Card 2: $14.50

Yearly fees: Card 1: $49 Card 2: $0


I'm pretty sure that I know the answer is that I should close the accounts, because I'm paying over $300 per year just to have the accounts open. I'm just wondering how much that is outweighted against the impact of closing them. Shortening the length of my accounts, the number of my accounts, increasing the %yield.",finance,1423516128

personalfinance,Tax mistake. Would like some reassurance.,"I started my first job outside of college at the end of july last year. I have no idea what I was thinking when I was filling out my w-4. I just realized that I mistakenly claimed 3. I am a single 25 y/o that no one can claim as a dependent. 
In total this year I paid ~$10,500 in federal taxes. I made ~$59,000. Looking at it, the amount being withheld from each pay check was based on my estimated annual salary, $120,000.
My understanding is, since I only made $59,000 (only worked for 6 months), my estimated tax owed would be based on that; meaning that, for 2014 I would owe roughly $8,500 in taxes as a single 25 y/o.
So, despite my stupid mistake of claiming 3, I should not owe any money if my thinking is correct? Since $10,500 was withheld on the basis of my estimated annual income being $120,000 and claiming 3, and I only would actually owe $8,500 on the basis of my actual income being only $59,000 (even after factoring in that I should not have been claiming 3).

I've been filing with the free variant of TurboTax, and, when I entered that info in, my expected amount due rose substantially--it appears I am going to be taxed something like $1500 on this income.

I have a car loan ($6000 left) which I am paying $120 to bi-weekly ($240 per month) - but I have also been making lump sum payments to it to try pay it off ASAP. It's at 7.24%. 

I also have a student loan with an interest rate of 5.35% (floating). It has $13,630 left to go. I am paying $210 towards it each month.

I believe I am making the minimum payments on both these loans. I prefer to make minimum payments, and then throw in as much extra money as I can with lump sum payments.

I also have a credit card that I sometimes make stupid impulse buys with, but I'm working on it. I do my best to keep it completely paid off. Right now it is not paid off, but it's just from work expenses that are waiting to be reimbursed. Once I get that back it will be back to $0.

I have absolutely zero savings. I am 22 years old and have been living ""paycheque to paycheque"" for most of my life. Now the reason I quote that is because I'm not really short of money... I just spend all the extra money when I have it, or have already spent it on my credit card...or when I'm feeling sensible, I put all the extra into my car loan (I figure pay off the higher interest loans first right?).

Now obviously I have some spending habits to work on, but I've  started to realize that I need to be saving money. I'd like to give investing a shot someday but I can't do that with no money.

personalfinance,"Came to my senses and finally sold all my company stock (RSU's) that have vested to me in the past 5 years. I will probably want to buy a home in the next 5 years.

Simply because I didn't know what I was doing, I left these stock units alone and didn't think about them.  I then read some blog post that said ""If someone gave you $100,000 to invest, would you put it all in one stock?  No! You'd be insane!"" and realized how insane it was to have my life's savings in one company.

I've been living fairly frugally entirely on my cash salary (about ~$44k/yr) with a solid emergency fund of 6 months expenses. I contribute enough to get the maximum employer match in my 401k.

With the sale of these stocks I have about 55k in liquid cash.  It's the most money I've ever had at once.

I know I pay taxes on these stock grants when I receive them, but I also think I owe capital gains now on these sales, because I sold most of the stock (luckily) for more than I ""bought"" it when it was given to me in the grant.  Is this correct?  How do I do this? Just keep the money in a savings account and remember ""DON'T TOUCH THIS YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO PAY TAXES!""?

Where do I go to invest in CDs?  Schwab still has 33k of mine in one account, and I clicked around and found some CDs through them but was unsure.  Are the CD's I get through Schwab more or less the same than other places?  It seems like Schwab is simply providing a marketplace for different institutions offering CDs. Or should I just transfer all the money out into my credit union savings account and get CDs elsewhere?

I pay my credit card balances in full every month, have extremely good credit and have no medical debt. I have around 5k left on my student loans at 4.875% interest.  Do I pay all this off, or is the interest rate low enough to leave it alone and put the 5k I would spend in an index fund? 5% ROI is pretty high for an index, correct?",finance,1423521509

personalfinance,I'm a Medical student. My mom passed away. I need help with income tax for IRA inheritance.,"Hey everyone,

I was hoping to get some advice.  I've only ever filled out a tax return once and it was pretty straight forward (used turbotax at a VITA office).

My mom passed away and I inherited an IRA which was distributed this past year.  The amount which is above the requirement for reporting for federal income tax.  I also earned interest on the bank account she left me.

I am a full time medical student with no other source of income.  I receive student loans (currently &gt;$180K).  How will this benefit my income tax return?  Will I be filing for education credits?

Lastly, my permanent residence is in California but I am out of state for school.  It says that if my total california gross income is less than $16K then I do not need to file a state tax return.  Since my bank address is listed at my school address (out of state) and the IRA distribution is my california address,  do they still both count as california gross income?

I contacted my local VITA for help but no ones at the office.  Will Myfreetaxes.com be enough?

Thanks in advanced. 

Here is all the info I have:

1099 R: Gross Distribution and Taxable amount: $15,340.  Distribution Code 4

1099 INT:  Total Interest Income (Line 1): $1,748

1098 T:  Amounts Billed for qualified tuition and related expenses (box 2): $57,028.

personalfinance,Advice on house buying timing,"I've been lurking for awhile and wanted to get some advice on purchasing a house, around the $175k range. We're really cramped in our current living space, and are wanting to take advantage of several things that come with living in a single family home. However, rental prices in our city exceed mortage payments, even if PMI is involved. 

I know the default advice is 20% down, 3-6 months emergency savings. I have some questions about that after the details.

* Married, no childern, no plans for any  
* Annual combined income $70k, monthly take-home pay $3700  
* Currently renting a very small 1 bedroom apartment, $575/month  
* Two auto loans, $7000, $250/mo, 3.5% interest; $8000, $250/mo, 2.9%  
* Student loan, $12k, $130/mo, 0.5%  
* No CC debt, but no savings (lots of life stuff, not super relevant)  
* We both have credit scores over 800  

We're planning on saving aggressively for the next 6 months, after which we could have around $9k saved up.

My questions are: Why 20% down? It seems to be along the lines of proving you have the financial discipline to handle a house and avoiding PMI. So, if you could get away with 5% down with no PMI and invest the rest, wouldn't that be better?  

I feel a bit rushed to get into a home. With housing prices steadily rising in my area, and the likelihood that the Fed will raise interest rates this summer, it seems like waiting may be costly, but I don't want to do anything stupid and even more costly. Would it be better to pay off one or both of the cars, or to save for a downpayment? I can't see any reason to pay off the student loan a day early, so I was going to leave it.

There are also downpayment assistance programs for FHA loans in my area, where they'll finance up to 5% of the downpayment for you, however there would be PMI in that scenario. I can guess this subreddit's thoughts on that, but thought I'd throw that out there: Is paying PMI vs paying higher interest from a Fed hike a relevant concern?

personalfinance,Employer Failed to withhold federal tax in 2014,"Hi Everyone, it's my first time posting here, and I'm in a really rough situation with my taxes. 

I just received my W-2 and went to do my taxes through turbotax. While entering them I realized box 2, my federal withholding, was empty, and upon completing my taxes with this information, I owe ~$3700, which I cannot afford, even if I wait and until the last minute to file and save until then.

I checked with my company's payroll department, and they confirmed that there was a clerical error or their part when entering my W-4 information, and no federal income tax was withheld. Unfortunately, I failed to notice. They fixed the problem, however I'm still about to be in a significant amount of unexpected debt. The problem is compounded because now that the withholding is properly applied I'll be making ~400/mo less than I'd anticipated. 
 
My CEO has offered me a loan to help pay taxes, but I don't have a lot of faith/trust in him or the company's ability to handle money and I'd rather not be in debt to them. Right now it seems like my only option is to arrange a payment plan with the IRS and hope the penalties aren't too severe. I'm considering asking for a raise to get my pay back to something that's comparable to the net pay I received without money being withheld.

I was hoping I could get some advice on what my options are to pay my taxes, as well as helping with budgeting throughout the year so I can lessen the severity of this blow to my finances. Here's some more info:

Pay is Twice/Month

2014 Income: $38,600 before taxes
2014 per pay period: $1,500 after taxes
2015 Expected Income $40,000 before taxes
2015 Expected per pay period: $1300-1340 after taxes.
2015 additional income: ~350/mo (I just started a second part time job 10hrs/wk at $9/hr)

Savings: $500, I'm disappointed because I had planned to spend the year building a safety net and paying off as much of my student loans as possible. I was able to pay my credit cards at the end of 2014, and had anticipated a fresh start.

Monthly Expenses:
Rent: $700
Utilities: $60-100
Gas: $200-300
Student Loan: $200
Dental Bill: $150 (This will be paid off in July)

personalfinance,Using Personal Loan to pay off Student Debt,"A friend of mine and myself had recently been talking about the savings that she has and how she regrets it languishing in a savings account making 0.85% interest. I jokingly mentioned that she should make me a loan to help me pay off some of my student debt, then the conversation started to get more serious. 

I currently have a $16,000 loan from Sallie Mae at 9% variable interest rate that is hanging around a little longer than I want it to. I was thinking that if she wanted to she could make a ""loan"" to me and then I would pay her back on that money. She gets to help her friend and get a higher ROI than she would in a savings account and I get this loan off my back. 

Now, that being said, I realize that generally mixing money and personal lives is a bad idea and that is definitely one of the major reasons I am considering not going ahead with this, but lets assume hypothetically that the repayment of the loan does not become an issue, are there any financial issues that I should be worried about being blindsided by? 

Some things I have contemplated are changes in my taxable income (16k suddenly shows up in my account) or ramifications on the lender (16k suddenly disappears).

Obviously we would need to set up some sort of binding legal document so that I couldn't just walk away from the loan, and we would need to have something that states conditions and interest rates and minimum monthly payments etc (would a microfund website like Kiva be viable?)

I'm just trying to gauge whether (FISCALLY!) this is a wise idea or not? Thoughts folks?

personalfinance,Need advice on a bank account seizure for back state taxes (Indiana),"I'm trying to gather some ammo and info to take to my father, who called me today because the state of Indiana wiped out his $1400 bank account. They say he still owes them $400. I have limited info from him until seeing him tomorrow, but I'm hoping you all can help me form the right questions and right actions to take when I see him.

What I know:

- He says it is for 2011, which he never filed on the state level because on his federal return he ""made -$1100"" (I'm assuming this means after his deductions)

- He says he got a letter awhile ago about it and they told him what form to send in to dispute it, which he did, and then he says this happened. He is positive he doesn't owe them anything and says they keep giving him the runaround, sending back income numbers that make no sense, etc.

- He had already spent a couple hours trying to call them, but he had yet to get through their automated system. He was very flustered, so I told him just to calm down today and we would tackle it together tomorrow.

My big questions:

- Should I say to hell with all of this and simply help him get a tax lawyer in Indiana? We both live in Ohio now and I am worried about the time and energy it will take dealing with the IN tax dept. over the phone.

- I know it was idiotic to just not file, but what are the chances we get this bill down to zero? My father is poor and has been for a long time. I understand late fees, but I can't fathom how he would have had a tax bill that year (and thus what interest could be owed on it).

- Would it be wise to talk to them about a payment program in order to get the funds returned? I don't want to agree to payments he doesn't really owe, but at the same time I'd say almost anything to get that money back in his bank account so he isn't starving.

- I'm assuming his job has direct deposit. Should I try to switch his direct deposit to my bank account to protect his future cash until this is sorted out? Or is that not possible/really stupid?

Any other suggestions you have would be very much appreciated. Sorry for the long post, I hope somebody has some advice because while I am much more responsible than my father, I'm really not the best at tax stuff.

personalfinance,Not sure whether to finance a car at 0% APR or finance it at &gt;0% APR with $1000 cash back.,"Hi PF.

I glimpsed over the FAQ and rules of this subreddit and it didn't seem to be against the rules and it's not under general advice, so I hope asking for some personal advice on my specific situation is okay.

So I've spent the last couple months looking at cars and narrowing my choices and choosing the best insurance.

I've decided to buy a new car. One that is a gas saver and safe and reliable. Right now, the new car of the model I'm looking at has an MSRP of about $29k. It has two incentives right now:

1) +$500 cash back with 0% APR if you finance it. (edit: the 0% APR is for 36 months. 0.9% for 48 months.)

2) +$1500 cash back if you buy it with cash.

Seeing as I do not have more than $25,000 in my bank account, I figured my only choice was to finance it as my work provides steady income. So I did not even consider option 2.

But after chatting with some dealerships, I was told that I could also finance with the second option. Just that it wouldn't be at 0% APR because it would be through my own bank or another loan program. 

I've spoken with several dealerships and the Out-The-Door prices for financing and cash buying are respectively ~$28,700 and ~$27,700. 

I'm not sure how the APR percentage works. And I'm trying to figure out at what percentage it would be better to take the second option with a non-zero APR to get the $1000 cheaper price.

Some information about me in case it is needed: I have good credit right now (about 750), no student loan debts (thankful for scholarships), and I make about $60,000 a year after taxes and 401k and HSA contributions. I have not started an IRA yet. I currently live with my parents so I don't pay any rent, but I plan on moving out within this year to either rent or mortgage a residence. 

My current bank has contacted me with an offer for a loan of $26,000 at 3.49% interest rate.

To reiterate, at what percentage APR should I take the second option of $1000 off the sales price?

Also, it was mentioned that I could ""refinance"". I have no idea what this means; does it mean I can keep changing my rate if it improves? How exactly does that work?",finance,1423532757

Russia is preparing the release of evidence of the involvement of the US government and intelligence services to the September 11 attacks. In the list of evidence includes satellite images, the website secretsofthefed. com.

Published material can prove malice government towards the people of the US and the successful manipulation of public opinion. US government planned to attack, but spent her proxy. So that an attack on America and the people of the United States looked like an act of aggression of international terrorism.

The motive for deception and murder its own citizens served as US oil interests in the Middle East state corporations.

The evidence will be so convincing that they fall on the previous cases to manipulate public opinion in order to achieve selfish private interests.

Russia proves that America is no stranger to expose and kill its citizens, that would make a pretext for military intervention in the foreign country. In the case of ""the September 11 attacks,"" the evidence will serve as satellite imagery.

If successful, the consequences of Putin's tactics, will be for the US government's most unsightly. The government's credibility will be undermined in the cities will begin mass protests turning into an uprising, paint a picture of American analysts.

And as the United States will look on the world political arena? The validity of America's position as a leader in the fight against international terrorism will be undermined than immediately take advantage of rogue states and Islamic terrorists.

economy,"Does the money's ""Store of value"" function actually exists?","Pardon my lack in Economics knowledge as I'm a learner. I'm aware of the following four functions of money:

1. Medium of exchange.
2. Measure of value (in dollars, pounds, etc.)
3. Standard for exchanging goods (guaranteed by the Fed)
4. A Store of value (as an asset).

AFAIK, the last one didn't exist according to Classical Economists, but only John Maynard Keynes brought it later in his theory.

I want to understand whether this function really exists? I'm more inclined to agree with the Classical Economists - 

I've created a simple analogy to understand this. Suppose there is a small village where there are N residents who trade only in barter. Now, you introduce a new bank in the village called Banko and a currency called pebbles. (For simplicity, lets assume that Banko is both a central bank and also lends/borrows money).

Now in order to leave barter and migrate to currency system, the villagers will have to either borrow pebbles from Banko, or sell their goods to them. So, there is a ""give"" and ""take"" or exchange of pebbles against goods.

But at the end of the day, if you consider the **overall macro-economic position**, the pebbles made no difference in *value* at all.  The villager's **NET WORTH** is same as it was before, the pebbles just facilitates transactions and used to count their assets now.

So, my question is, if money doesn't make any difference to the REAL value of goods and services, how can it be considered an asset?",finance,1423539301

personalfinance,Personal Loan Tax Ramifications,"Hi all, first time posting here, sorry if I break any rules with this.
Last July (2014) I made a loan to a family member.  They needed money to buy something for their business.  It was a $35,000 USD loan.  I read all about gift tax etc.  I made the loan with the lowest allowable interest rate that the IRS allowed for that month of the year.  I also drafted a standard loan agreement and we both signed.

The money is scheduled to be paid back in one total payment along with the interest in one year from the start of thr loan, so I would get it back this coming July. 

My question, will I have to report anything for 2014 taxes which Im about to file soon? Or will it be for next years taxes since i havent been paid back yet.

Just to clarify, the payment schedule was one year and it would be paid in full plus interest at the end of that one year.  No split up smaller payments x amount of times.  Just one lump sum back.

Also, worst case scenario, the business goes under or he cant pay me back, i assume i still have to pay the IRS tax for the interest even if i didnt get paid back?  I can afford to lose the 35k if it comes to that.

Bitcoin,Let's be clear Bitcoin does work without bitcoin the currency.,"Please stop comparing bitcoin (the currency) to a company like Netscape and Nabster, it is not.  The #1 reason bitcoin the currency will survive and become mainstream is because of its first mover advantage.  Sure anyone can create a blockchain and use their own currency on it but why should anyone use it?  Does it provide a better benefit?  If so why couldn't Bitcoin (the protocol) agree to implement this wonderful change?  The answer is it will.  In fact, the government can go out and create their own Blockchain.  Let's call it FedCoin which is stabilized by a group of 12 people who control the coin supply.  You want to jump on FedCoin?  Did not think so.  You must understand money has a huge Networking effect so even if another alt coin does offer better advantage of Bitcoin does not mean people would switch over to accepting it.

Here's my situation:  

 I'm 26 and have never really given a thought to retirement before, thought I'd die or the world would end before I needed to worry about it, so I just let my employers handle any funds I might contribute to retirement.  I'm slowly coming to the realization that I should start looking forward to the future and have gotten a handle on my finances and started budgeting. 

I checked into what I have accrued so far and I have $1100 in a TSP account from a federal job I worked previously for a few years, and $8,700 in employee contributions to my current employers retirement system (Texas Municipal Retirement System, if that helps... I believe it is a 401k of some sorts but not entirely sure) over the last 4 1/2 years.  

I am likely changing jobs soon into a similar career field where I will be moving up from ~$45,000 annual salary to $55-60,000.

Further info, if it helps to advise:   

I have no student loans, no medical bills, no credit card debt and am currently working on paying off $6,000 on an auto loan through USAA for my truck, which is worth around $13,000. I have adequate savings and an emergency fund. 

What do you think the best option for someone in my situation to begin preparing for future stability/retirement?

personalfinance,Credit Card Utilization Question.,"- *A little background, 25 years old. Looking to buy a house in the next 5 -14 months. Looking to get my credit score as high as I can until then so I can get the best mortgage rates. I have a few questions about Credit Utilization.*


I have two credit cards that I use. One is my everyday credit card that I put 99% of my purchases on. The credit limit is $9,500. I pay this credit card off 100% every month. I normally use between 10%-20% on this card.


Recently I got another credit card where I received a cool deal through Wells Fargo where it's 0% interest rate for 2 years (my SO and  needed furniture very badly for our apartment). It's one of those deals where I get a ""credit cards"" but you don't actually get a card, it's more of a line of credit. The deal is if I make 24 of the ""minimum"" payments over 24 months Wells Fargo will ""wash"" away the interest  accrued during the 24 month period.


The problem is I was was approved for a $13,500 card from Wells Fargo, I still owe $7,100 making my credit utilization for that card  ~52%. 


I read that FICO scores look at both individual % and combined %.


As of right now my daily use Credit Cars is normally 10%-20% (sometimes it spikes high when I do large purchases, but again I pay it off 100% monthly) 


My Wells Fargo is at  ~50%, It would take me 9 months on the 24 payments to get to 30%  utilization.


Giving me a combined total utilization of  ~36% (which I'd like to get under 30%). 


I was wondering what would be the best option for me. Right now My **Credit Karma** says I have a TransUnion: 699 (before getting Wells Fargo it was at ~734)  Equifax: 739



**I guess I have a few options:**


 - Call Wells Fargo, Ask them if I can pay down my ""promotional deal"" card down past 30% utilization. So I'd dump ~$3,000 into the account. The only down side of this is I might break the promotional deal of 24 equal payments over 24 months. 


- Look for another credit card and hopefully get approved for at least $5,000, bringing down my total credit utilization down to 30%, but keeping my Wells Fargo credit card at 50%. I've actually been in the market for a new Credit Card any ways.



- Only use my daily use Credit Card for about $100 a month (put the rest on Debt Card/Cash), $100 + $7,100 = 7,200       $7,200/$23,000 = .313 * 100 = 31%. Then after next month after I pay the monthly payment on Wells Fargo  $7,100 - 300 = $6,800 +$100 (daily credit card). So $6,900/23,000 = .03 * 100 = 30%. Continue this pattern, as in every time I pay off $300 to my Wells Fargo I can put an extra $300 in my Daily use Credit Card? 


- Do nothing?



I guess my big concern is if I do get another credit card, it will show up as a ""hard inquire""  in my credit pull for my mortgage. Well what do you guys think?",finance,1423576765

personalfinance,Paying off your mortgage early vs. investing the money,"I am four years into a 15 year mortgage at a 3.375% interest rate.  My wife recently read Dave Ramsey's total money makeover and is very excited about trying to get all of our debts paid off.  I am too.

We could pay the entire mortgage off in the next 5 years, by paying around two grand a month more than our minimum payment, or we could invest that amount in a taxable investment account.

We already have a solid emergency fund, are already maxing Roth IRA and 401K, and are contributing to a 529 for our daughter at the amount we think is necessary. 

So, this is really about whether it is better to invest this roughly 24K a year in a taxable investment account, or pay the mortgage off.  

If we pay the mortgage off early, we will be in a position to begin contributing $4K / month to an investment account in roughly five years, whereas if we pay the minimums on the mortgage, it will be a closer to ten years, but we will have ten years of beating the interest rate to show for it.

personalfinance,"Used Car Purchase, Cash vs Finance Sanity Check","I'm looking to buy a used $40k car, putting $10k down from my current car. Like many before me I'm deciding between paying the remaining $30k in cash, or borrowing at 4% for 36 months and tossing the $30k into my Vanguard index funds. 


From my calculations, as long as my rate of return is equal to the interest rate, I'm slightly better off financing. The 4% loan over 36 months would cost $1900 in interest. Over 3 years that $30k would grow by $3800 with a very conservative 4% rate of return. After taxes, this would be a modest ~$1200 advantage over paying with cash. Not much but $1200 is still $1200, and it would hopefully be more.


**Notes**

- I've tried to beat 4%, but it is about the best I can get on a 7+ year old car, even with excellent credit.

- I normally buy cars with cash, but have a psychological $20k limit for this practice. Is that irrational?

- The $30k is already liquid and not part of my emergency fund (12mo).

- I can comfortably afford the car either way, just trying to save a couple grand if I can.

- 06/07 911 C2S for those that are curious. I expect relatively soft depreciation moving forward.

personalfinance,To anyone considering a career in medicine/dental/health with crushing debt....,"TL;DR - real-life health professionals battle crushing debt, progress after 4.5 years.  580K down to 330K, still had time and money to live life, even while making stupid financial decisions.  

On a weekly basis, there are posts about young professionals getting into the medical/dental/vet/health field with high debt and struggling income.  I thought I'd share my story of the last 4.5 years.  I am by no means very successful or the glowing example.  In fact, we probably make a lot of emotional decisions rather than the best financial decisions.  But we were able to do this all without IBR, PAYE, or selling a kidney.  And we still have crushing debt, but we are managing it better as well.  


But my life is good, we are making slow and steady progress, and maybe numbers will help people considering these fields.  I'm sure there are others out there doing a ton better, hopefully not too many doing a lot worse, but this is our story.


Background: Spouse and I are both in medicine/dentistry.  We graduated with 535,000 of student loans together, interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 8.5%.  We moved to suburban upstate NY to find jobs, so cost of living is pretty average.  Not as cheap as other states when it comes to taxes, but definitely cheaper than metropolitan areas.  


During residency: we put most government loans on deferment and paid minimums on the private, only because we did our residencies in expensive cities and only made about 42K each.  And here's poor financial decision #1, we decided to save money to get married instead of pay off loans.  
Our loans ballooned to about 580,000 with the additional interest during the years of residency.  Ugh.


First year out: we made a lot of poor financial decisions this year.  We got married, which was expensive, and of course we went on a honeymoon too.  We only had one car which was completely paid off, but we got a second one, used, but still took out a car loan for that.  We rented a ""nicer"" apartment, so we were definitely guilty of lifestyle creep.  We both worked full time, but in multiple offices, so together our gross pay was just under 200K.  You would think that was a ton of money, but like I said, we made some stupid decisions.  We paid only the minimum on our loans.  Maybe our loan balance went from 580,000 to 560,000, because the majority of our payment was only paying interest.  


Second Year: Pretty similar to first year, except we woke up to the fact we were not getting anywhere in debt repayment.  We each switched offices and found full time positions, but our salary stayed about the same. One big change we made, we consolidated the 8.5% loans to 4%.  Big deal there, reduced our payments significantly.  We also decided to start saving money for a down payment on a house, since housing is cheaper in the long run than renting in our area.  Again, still mostly paying minimums on our loans, which was very very stupid.  Maybe loans went from 560,000 to 530,000.  Which is almost our original loan amount.  We were not very financially savvy at this point.


Third year:  We bought a modest house, so our living costs did go down thankfully.  We were geared up to do better.  Really.  We started budgeting, we gained some experience with work so our combined gross income for year three was 280K.  We weren't ""saving"" for anything anymore, so we were aggressively paying extra towards student loans.  We knocked out a lot of the 6.8% loans that year as well, as well as finished the car loan.  540,000 to 430,000.  Phew!  That felt good.


Fourth Year and half of Fifth Year: Income wise, we were a bit stagnant, gross 280K again.  However, another change was that my spouse decided to purchase a practice to address the stagnant income.  So we started dividing extra monies toward principal and down payment fund for the practice purchase.  Still made pretty good progress with loans though, 430,000 to 330,000 so far, and 80,000 saved up for down payment.  Highest interest rate is now only 4%.  


So, we have been plugging away.  Yes, we are getting into more debt again, but the potential increase in income is about 100K+.  We are very aware of lifestyle creep now, so we probably live off of 50K a year, which is still a very comfortable life and includes small vacations.  So all the rest is basically for loans and savings for things like practice purchases.  We even have a little in retirement, 152K.  Not a ton for a couple in their early 30s, but we are making progress people!


With the practice purchase, we still won't be out of debt for maybe 8 years.  But, life is comfortable and jobs are fulfilling and exciting.  We don't live fancy lifestyles, but it's by no means meager either.  And as stated earlier, if we did everything perfectly by the financial rules way, maybe we could have been another 100K - 200K ahead.  Not that we spent that much on the wedding, car, house, etc.  But we also did not take jobs that paid higher, but were basically medical and dental mills.  You can get paid a lot, but you sacrifice patient care and quality of life/stress/work-life balance.  But if we did earn crazy amounts earlier in our career, we probably would have paid less interest in the long run. But that's the power of compounding interest.  I think our total interest paid so far is like 151K.  God that's awful.   But once you look at your principals and it seems like the balance hasn't changed, you really get motivated to start throwing money at the loan itself.   

Anyway, I'm sure there are other professionals out there that did a lot better with debt repayment.  This is just our story, so if this scares some people, than maybe the health field is not for you.  But if you are passionate about the health field and the numbers scare you away, maybe you can see that even with lots of mistakes and lots of decisions that are not the most financially beneficial, you can still pay it off, even if its slowly over time.  Or, just avoid the mistakes we made and you'll be a few years ahead.  Either way, it's doable but you have to realize early on that it's the long-game and patience and discipline is necessary.",finance,1423595902

As of this year I began to start paying off other collection’s agencies, be an authorized used on a BofA CC and continue to make on time payments on my FedLoan so I can rebuild my credit and eventually buy a house. 

2 weeks ago I received a letter to the address of the primary user of the BofA CC that I’m a user on. This is a collections statement from Convergent Outsourcing Inc.
Details of the letter include: Date: 1/23/15; Current owner: Midland Funding: Original Creditor: GE Money Bank; Total Balance: $856.28; Settlement in Full: $513.77

I noticed that this Convergent Outsourcing is listed several times under the section of “ Inquires only shared with you”. They apparently inquired on 1/8/15, 8/19/14, and on 8/20/14

I began to start doing research on how to fix this on my credit history with the FAQs in the sidebar. So given the fact that this debt is so old I begun to complete a certified letter using the second template in this link: http://www.ballardspahr.com/~/media/files/alerts/2013-07-11-cfpbletters.pdf  so I could get more information about this debt. I did further research and noticed that both CA have beyond horrible reviews and known for scamming people.

**So my questions are:**
1.	Before I send a certified letter to Convergent is there anything else I should do? Or not send it at all since the debt is so old?

2.	Why doesn’t the original creditor on my account have any date that it’ll fall off my record?

3.	If I decide to pay either one of these shady CA what is the safest method to do so?

4.	Why is there so many inquires that I can only see that Convergent is making on my credit report?

5.	Will there be a chance that Convergent will be added to my negative account history right next to Walmart (GE) and Midland on my credit report?

Thank you so much for any advice, this sub has been beyond helpful to me for the past few weeks and any other advice would be helpful!

personalfinance,I'm getting my first paycheck at the end of this week and want some advice about how much to put towards savings and student loans.,"I just graduated in December and I started my first full-time job mid-January (~$45k salary/year).  I get paid bi-weekly and I'll be getting my first paycheck at the end of this week.  I made the decision to live at home for at least a year and hopefully pay off a good chunk of my student loans and also build up my savings so that I can afford a nicer place to live when I do move out.  

I'm in my grace period for my student loans - which are around $26k.  I plan on buying a car hopefully by the end of April/start of May.  I'd like to put a down payment of $5,000 on it, so I need to include that in my savings amount (my savings account is currently ~$1k).  

I'm really lucky to have generous parents and not have any other monthly expenses to worry about besides student loans (and eventually car payments) until I move out.  

I wanted some advice about how to split my paychecks every two weeks into savings and then loan payments.  I'll eventually need to start splitting them into savings, loan payments, and car loan payments (hoping to get a $17,000 car loan, but I haven't investigated interest rates yet).  

I was thinking of putting $1,000 towards my student loans and then ~$700 to savings, but I realized that doesn't really take into account my down payment on a car....

personalfinance,Will I improve my credit score enough to make a significant difference on an auto loan interest rate?,"I'll be getting 2 sums of bonus income in the next few months: $2k in May, $2K in August. I was going to put $2k for a down payment on a car, and $2k to pay off my remaining CC debt. I can't decide which to pay first. I know scenario 1 is cheaper, but which scenario makes more sense when you factor in convenience?

Scenario 1: Pay CC first. I save money on 4 months worth of interest payments, and maybe (?) improve my credit score enough to get a better interest rate on a car loan. The downside is I delay getting a car for 4 months, and I can't overstate how difficult/inconvenient that is for my living situation.

Scenario 2: Get car first. I pay an extra 4 months interest and a lower credit score may significantly increase interest rates on the auto loan. 

I'm okay with paying a few extra months of CC interest to have a car earlier, but if a lower credit score (because of high utilization on that CC) increases my auto loan interest rate significantly, then it won't be worth it. FWIW my credit score is currently around 700",finance,1423598941

personalfinance,Parent wants to borrow from the balance of our line of credit,"I'd like to get some advice from the Personal Finance community on a recent request from my husband's father. This is a very strange situation, one I would much prefer not to be in.

Here's the backstory:
My spouse and I at one point last year needed to have access to a commercial line of credit of $100,000. This line of credit was sponsored by my spouse's well off and fiscally savvy family member. He had his bank extend us a commercial line of credit at a &lt;2% interest rate, secured by the balances in his accounts. We only used part of the credit line, and our financial goal for 2015 is to pay off the balance (leaving us debt free) by November, which we anticipate achieving.

The situation:
A few days ago, my spouse's father, who knew about the credit line, asked my spouse casually in a social context whether we'd wound up using the line of credit. Unsuspiciously, my spouse told him the situation.

The next day, my spouse got a call from their father, saying that he needed the exact amount of money remaining on our line of credit for his business, within a few days. He has received the same help from the generous relative himself already (several hundred thousand of commercial credit line) for this business. He does not want to go back to the relative to ask for another line of credit and is instead asking us for access to ours. He has said that he is happy to whatever terms and guarantees we would want to put in place.

The decision:
Every rational part of me says that the answer here is a firm no. We are uncomfortable with the credit line in the first place, and are trying to eliminate it as quickly as possible. It concerns me that my spouse's father has already put quite a bit of money into the business, and needs more, and is reluctant to reach directly to the generous relative. However, if it were my father, I would have a hard time saying no. I would feel more comfortable simply giving him a smaller sum as a gift, even if it wouldn't meet his needs, than taking out money from the line of credit in our names and lending it to him. Personal Finance, can any of you provide advice or thoughts on how to handle this request, without burning bridges with my spouse's family?",finance,1423600088

personalfinance,Question About Car Loans,"I am interested in getting a car this summer. I have ~10k to use as a down payment and i plan on financing the rest (~10-15k).   
So heres some background: I currently don't have a credit card. For a while I thought my parents were helping me build credit by having me as an authorized user on their account. After realizing that I didn't have any credit (and receiving bad advice), I attempted to acquire a credit card but was denied multiple times. The credit card company told me to wait 6 months to try again because a company won't issue me a card if I've been denied multiple times in a short period of time.  
I realize that to get a decent interest rate on a car loan, you need to have a decent credit. My question is about a co-signer. Both my parents (who have a great credit score) offered to co-sign the loan I take out. Would the interest rate be lower if they co-signed with me? I.e. would the bank/car dealership use their credit over mine.

personalfinance,"CANADA - Alamo has put a blip on my credit score, it just goes on and on...","In June of 2012, I rented a car through Alamo at the Vancouver Airport. I had pre-booked and pre-paid online. I picked up my car at the airport, gave them my visa and drivers license, paid for some insurance and I was on my way.

This was kind of a pointless road trip, the plan was to do a little shopping and visit some friends. I wound up going to Powell River and staying at my family's cabin for 3 days longer than planned. I phoned Alamo up and they said ""don't worry about, we'll charge your visa for the extra days when you drop it off"". Cool.

I dropped the car off on time, under the amount kilometers that I was allowed, in the same condition and with a full tank of gas. The dude at the airport inspected it and said that I was good to go. They charged my visa an additional $200ish for the extra days. Everything was good. 

August 2013, I get a phone call at my office from a collections agency. They say that I owe $42. It seemed super fishy to me because a robot voice was on the line when I answered and then they connected to a human. They didn't tell me what the charge was for and they wanted me to give them my credit card number. I asked them to send me a bill in the mail.

A few weeks later, I got the bill. It had one line item - Alamo $42. I phoned Alamo up and asked them what the charge was for. They didn't know. They told me that that transaction was over and collections was dealing with it. I was annoyed because Alamo had my visa, they could have charged it. They had my address, they could have sent me a bill. They had my phone number, they could have phoned me. They did none of that, they sent my mystery bill to collections without even giving me the opportunity to pay it.

I phoned the collections agency and asked them what the charge was for, they didn't know either. I googled the name of the collection agency and couldn't find anything about them online. I figured that some desperate Alamo employee and this bogus company were running a scam. The Vancouver airport is BUSY. I figured that if they sent a bogus $42 charge to a small percentage of their clients, they'd be laughing their way to the bank.

I took photocopies of everything, filled out a debt collection complaint form and sent it off to the Consumer Protection Agency of BC (http://www.consumerprotectionbc.ca/consumers-debt-collection/how-to-make-a-complaint/forms). I did not pay my bill. That was stupid of me and I regret it to this day. The most annoying thing is that my husband and I make a good amount of money. I wouldn't think twice about $42 except that I wanted to know what it was for. 

Long story short, the Consumer Protection Agency of BC did not even respond to my query. The collection agency harassed me for a bit longer and I got tired of it and paid up. I still have no idea what the charge was for and I don't even care anymore.

I'm no longer allowed to rent a vehicle from Alamo, Enterprise or National. I had nearly perfect credit until this incident and it'll take a few years to fix.

2015, I did some home renos and wracked up my credit line. I figured out that I could consolidate the debt and the mortgage payments would go up by $200 per month but credit line would be wiped clean. The interest rate for the mortgage is significantly lower than the interest rate on the credit line AND we're allowed to pay up to $700 more than our mortgage payment every two weeks so we can pay it down aggressively, which we were anyway. The bank ran a credit check and they want to talk to me about Alamo, urgh!! I'm going to talk to the mortgage specialist this afternoon and I'm sure I'll clear everything up on that front. But this is so annoying! 

I never knew that $42 could cause such a big headache. How do I fix this?

""Due to your student loan balances totaling over $26,000; you are now eligible to receive benefits from a new law that has passed regarding federal student loans including TOTAL FORGIVENESS in some circumstances.""

This third party company, the Student Loan Education Center, claims to be a consumer advocacy group that work directly with the U.S. Department of Education. They told me that due to the ""Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010"" I am eligible for a loan forgiveness program. Basically I would pay them $600 and they would file the necessary paperwork to get me on an income-based loan that according to them will save me a lot of money. They claimed that I would have a payment of $0 for the first year, and yet would still save money because the balance woud be forgiven after a certain amount of time (240 or 300 months I believe).

I asked them if this was a federal program why I couldn't just file the paperwork myself rather than paying them $600 to do it for me? They replied that I could, but the application is somewhat difficult and I might not be accepted into the program if I didn't fill everything out right.

My only debts were from two different sources. The first one was from an electronic store were I purchased a computer at horrible interest rates.( Financed through a company named RacAcceptance)  I know i was 18 new to credit and didn't pay attention to the numbers). The second one is from a small loan company I made all the payments on time except from when I hit that rough patch of unemployment. I went two months without making a payment, but I've recently caught up and looking at one more payment before I'm finished paying it of.  I hadn't looked at my credit score from credit karma in a couple of months. Once I checked I noticed my score had gone from 650 to 547. The only red flags I see are these two Accounts.

My plan for the small loans company is two make the last payment and get them to drop the late marks. I've made all timely payments since taking out the loan (about a year). CK says this has set my back almost 50 points. Is this the correct action to take?

Another question is what to do about the electronics company? They told me when it got reposed that I wouldn't be charged for any of the balance left. (Not to sure how truthful that is) What action should I take in getting this cleared on my credit report? I was about 3 payments behind.

Is it especially confusing that all the online calculators say we could be approved based on our **monthly minimum debt payment**, however when I spoke with somebody at a bank I was told they would consider debt repayment as **3% of total balance per month**. That seems very steep, considering student loans are often repaid over several years, not 3% monthly.

2) Would it be possible, or wise, to add debt to a new mortgage to take advantage of the low interest rates? Would this help in the approval process by reducing monthly debt payments in the eyes of the lender? (even though we would then pay the mortgage faster)

I'm looking for some car advice. About 8 months ago I bought a brand new BMW 335i as a gift to myself. It's a good car but I'm not really in love with it anymore. I'm currently paying 860/month as my car payment, ~$100 for insurance and about $180-$200 for fuel, but thats more because fuel is in a slump. So all in all my car costs are around 1200-1400/month. Now I just had a kid and I'm looking to buy a house in about a year, so I wanna maximize my contributions to my down payment and I think the car may be the best place to start. Assuming I can sell this car for what I owe, I was thinking of getting an electric or plugin hybrid an take advantage of the federal and state tax breaks. The breaks would be about 10k if I went full electric, or about 5k if I did a plug in hybrid. Given this info, would it really make sense to sell the BMW (already paid off about 20%) and get something new again or should I just stick with the car I have?  If so, what would be a good breaking point to take a loss on the BMW if I did have to sell it for less than owed? I'd love a pure financial perspective on the situation, however there are other factors that will go into this decision (how much I like the other cars, if I can sell my current car, if pure electric is even an option at this point). 

Thanks!!",finance,1423634236
personalfinance,I moved to another state to work for 3 months. These are the only 3 months that I had earned income. Do I file taxes in my permanent state?,"Hi, I got a tax question, and a search did not yield any results similar to the situation I'm in.

I am a full time student at a school in Michigan, permanent residence is in Illinois. Over the summer I worked for 3 Months in Minnesota. I've already filed Minnesota tax return and Federal tax return, and I'm wondering if I need to file an Illinois return?  I have zero earned income while living in Illinois or Michigan (at school). All my earned income was over the 3 months I lived in Minnesota. However, I did not become a MN resident in that time. My permanent address was still IL. 

 Do I file the Illinois return, and if so, do I report 0 income?  

There are no lines on my W2 that have income earned in IL, so essentially I would be filing a blank return. This makes we wonder if I even need to bother sending it.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin vs fiat; Ad-hoc analysis of monetary policy vs game theory analysis of bitcoin.,"The federal reserve doesn't rely on strict equations for its monetary policy, it uses a system of voting among the chairmen. That causes uncertainty, which means that the only form of analysis is anecdotal and ad-hoc. 

Bitcoin does exactly what it is programmed to do, therefore it is much easier to calculate the behavior of its users and the future behavior of the currency.  We can look at the benefits and risks that people have, and use that to calculate future behavior. With Central banking in its current form, its complicated to the point that predicting the future is virtually impossible.

Im not trying to say that we can predict the future of individual crypto-currencies at the moment. But I do believe that it is very possible ( and wasn’t possible before Bitcoin)

Fiat does X as long as Chairman 1 votes yes/no on proposition Y.

Bitcoin does X because that's what the code says it will do.

science,"Science AMA Series: I’m Rich Hartel, professor of Food Engineering at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Ask me anything about the science behind chocolate.","What would you like to know about Chocolate?

In the basement of Babcock Hall on the Madison campus, my research group
is dedicated to the study of such goodies as chocolate, candy and ice
cream.  In fact, if you watched The Amazing Race last Fall, the two Food
Scientists (known as the Sweet Scientists), Amy and Maya, who won the
race are PhD students with me.  Candy, chocolate and particularly ice
cream, are really complex materials, and our focus of study is on
controlling phase transitions, mostly of ice, sugar and fats.  For
example, Maya studies the fat phase in ice cream - it's much more
complicated than you think. And sorbitol, the sugar free gum ingredient
that Amy studies, is even more complex yet.

For this session, I'm happy to answer questions about chocolate.  
Probably one of the most interesting things about chocolate is how cocoa
butter crystallizes when it's cooled.  If you get it right, chocolate is
a beautiful, shiny piece that releases easily from the mold.  Get it
wrong and it quickly turns into a hideous whitish gray color.  No that's
not mold, it's actually just cocoa butter doing things it shouldn't do.

Tune in to the [ACS Webinar on Thursday 2/12](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/events/upcoming-acs-webinars/chocolate-chemistry.html) and hear all the details.  
I've got some really cool videos of cocoa butter crystallizing and will
explain what tempering of chocolate involves from a technical viewpoint.

I’ll be answering questions at 12pm ET.

12:10 EST  A little late with some technical difficulties, but I'll be answering questions for the next hour.

One general comment since there appears to be some confusion.  Real chocolate, that meets the US Standard of Identity, can only contain certain ingredients, as laid out in the Code of Federal Regulations.  Any product that falls outside the Standard of Identity is usually called compound coating.  The main difference between chocolate and coating is the fat - chocolate can only contain cocoa butter and milk fat whereas coatings typically have palm kernel oil, a cheaper fat.

1:10 EST  Sorry, I need to sign off now since I've got someone waiting outside my door.  I'll try to come back later and answer more questions.  I wish I could to all of them but the response has been overwhelming.  If you can, try to log in to the ACS webinar tomorrow for more details and some interesting pictures and videos.

personalfinance,Need some advice on what my next steps should be,"Hey PF community!
So I am about a month shy of paying off about 10k in credit card debt that I took out a loan to pay off at a lower rate! I'm pretty excited about that. 

So a little more about me... I am a FT software developer, recently graduated, and make about 40k/yr and my company currently does not offer any 401k matching or even a plan yet. I have about 48k in student loans. Recently, I made a large purchase for $5300 that I took a loan out on which has 0% interest for 5 years and equal payments to pay it off on time. I have about 20k in available credit cards of varying interest rates and no credit debt. I use YNAB to help navigate my budget which helps me keep the credit cards in check. My monthly bills are around $1200 (not including food and gas and non-billy expenses). Finally, I have no emergency fund. My focus was to pay off my credit card debt and then possibly start saving.

This leads me to where I am now. I really want to pay off my debts  before I begin saving, but everyone seems to support the build-a-emergency-fund mind set. I've also read that a credit card could be considered an emergency fund (though the FAQ suggests having it in cash). I have this urge to want to pay off my $5300 loan first, then work on my student loans. I have read that a regular loan affects my credit more than student loans do. But, I also understand that a loan with no interest is free money that I can pay back without paying for. This makes me want to work on student loans. Then finally, I feel like I should build my emergency fund, or not, depending on how one looks at credit cards being available for emergencies.

personalfinance,Relationship ending - need assistance in untangling finances and coping with a mountain of debt and expenses. (Details inside),"So due to reasons that are largely unimportant my relationship of four years is coming to an abrupt end. As we are living together with shared expenses I am struggling to make heads or tails of my future finances.

Our lease is up in August – and the location we live in is very “high end”. Currently we are on good-ish terms, she pays what little of the bills she has always done (in her defense she makes much less than I do and has more debt), but during the end of our relationship there was talk of her going back on cruise ships for work. In the event that this happens – I am concerned that she will split hanging me with her portion of the bills in an overpriced apartment I cannot afford alone. 

So without further hesitation – here’s what my financials look like. 

**Income ($2,000.00 monthly)**
		
* Job	$1900 (475 paid weekly)
* Stipend	$100	(Trust disbursement)
		
		
**Expense (-1760.00 monthly)**		

* Rent -1050	(Ouch)

* Credit Card -300	(16k balance)

* Loans -200	(3k balance)

* Insurance -160	(Still carrying my ex on my insurance - see post)

* Travel -50	(I live 10 minutes from my job and everything I want is almost walkable) 
		
**Fun Times	(-105.00 monthly)**	

* World of Warcraft -15	MMO Sub is a cost saving measure long term

* Gym Membership -30	

* Disney Annual Pass -60	Going away in June
		
		
**Additional Windfalls**		

* ""Extra"" Paychecks 1900 (4 ""extra"" paychecks during 5 week months)

* Dividends 1400 (700 paid once in June and once in December)

* Holiday Bonus 800	(2 weeks pay taxed heavily in December)
		
**Expenses once she leaves**	

* Phone Bill -110 (Much like insurance, she is also on the phone plan and will be removed)

* Electric Bill -100 (It's less but I am assuming ""worst case"" Florida heat wave)

* Cable Bill -60 (Only 1 internet option I don't use basic cable/TV/Phone.)
		
**Additional Notes**	

* I file single 0 and given my effective tax rate I can adjust to single 1 to increase take home pay in the short term

* Overtime pay is not a reliable option

* I have nothing in savings (Seriously I have like 200 bucks in loose change in jars and that's it)

I didn’t include food in the expenses – but right now I am sitting on 135/month. With her gone I go to -135/month. Now I’ll save some money from dropping her from phone/insurance – but it still leaves me in a position of “barely solvent and with no food”

I thankfully have health insurance, plenty of paid time off, and as a shocking cash saver – my work has a free cafeteria that provides hot lunch daily. (Food isn’t amazing by any means but baked chicken, salad, yogurt, veggies, etc. save a TON of money monthly). 

So where do I even start? I can presume she will be out as early as April and as late as August. I have grown fat (figuratively) and complacent with a second person popping up a lavish lifestyle. 

Edit: Fixed the terrible formatting. 

Edits:

1)	Regarding the CC Debt – the interest rate is 7.9% and runs about $1100.00 in interest annually (typing that hurts). The $300.00 is assuming doubling the monthly minimum (which is $150.00) If this money can be better allocated (towards a loan payment for example) I am open to suggestion. 

2)	I left this out of the original post – because I don’t personally consider it an option but I am carrying around $50,000 in company stock (ESOP account) which is where the dividends mentioned are paid from. Liquidating the stock is obviously incredibly difficult (and costly). So OMG HOMELESSNESS is not a concern. Even after penalties I could in theory wipe my debt out. 

3)	The phone – I have been reliably advised that I can do better on much cheaper mobile plans. As I am not currently paying the bill (my ex is) and am out of contract I’ll be doing this to cut expenses. Additionally my insurance will also drop to around $110/month once she is removed. 

4)	The living situation – she’s here because she has nowhere else to go, and we don’t HATE one another. It’s a peaceful environment and while she pays basically nothing (like $260.00 worth of bills) she does clean and do laundry. My concern is that once she takes a contact job she will up and leave and hang me with her expenses instead of leaving when the lease expires in August. Since I do not know when/if the sudden spike in expenses will occur – I want to be as prepared as possible. (She does not have a job offer yet and may not receive one in fact)

5)	I am going to assume – judging from the comments – that regardless of reducing expenses, a second job is still advised and increasing my income by a minimum of $500.00 monthly is what I would need to remain comfortably out of the red. 


Edit #3

I checked into the IRS Withholding (no state tax for FL) and bumping to single 1 would increase my monthly income by roughly $50.00 - single 2 would increase it further but put me at risk for getting slapped with a tax bill in 2016.

personalfinance,What is the best way to manage my savings while being in debt?,"Hi everyone,

I am currently living at home and my monthly income after taxes and expenses are taken out is around $1650. Although if I decided to get an apartment, a rent payment would probably knock that down to about $900-950.

I hope to one day own a house and am wondering what is my best option here? Should I spend my spare income on paying off one of my debts, or would it be better to try and save up for a down payment? Or would my money be better off tied up in an investment or retirement fund?

personalfinance,Girlfriend starting grad school - large amount of student loans needed - marriage - advice,"I could use some advice.  My girlfriend (25) of over 4 years will be starting physical therapy school this summer.  It is a 3-year program at a private institution, and it won't be cheap.  In terms of just tuition, health insurance, books/supplies, and student service fees, we're looking at around $42,000 a year.  The school says that those items historically have increased 4-7% annually, and therefore, the sum for those three years will be around $130,000 (excluding interest that accrues while she's in school). 
 
Fortunately, I (27) am in a good financial situation.  I make around $120k a year (this will likely increase by $10-30k by the end of the year, assuming I pass my field's certification exam later this year), have relatively low debt (student loans are just over $6k and will be paid off in a few months, owe $14k on a car at a 0.9% interest rate).  Therefore, I don't mind paying for our rent and also her living expenses - food, gas, car insurance, phone (~$500/month) while she's a student.
 
Financially speaking, what would be the wisest way to approach this, especially when it comes to marriage and the timing of it? 
 
I should add that for her financial aid, the best approach is to get the max direct unsubsidized Stafford loan ($20.5k) and top off the rest with an institutional loan - both of which are not need-based.  So getting married would not affect that.  Being able to file taxes as married filing joint returns when she is a student and living off my income alone will save us around $7-8k (plus any potential student credits &amp; deductions) on federal income tax.  If I were to be pessimistic and think about the possibility of getting a divorce before paying off her loans, we do not live in a community property state.  So if I'm not mistaken, her loans would not end up being my burden.  Therefore, I'm thinking it makes the most sense, money-wise, to get married sooner...unless I'm overlooking something? 
 
I should also mention for those that may be thinking it - we would not be getting married just for the potential financial benefits - this post is a question of ""when,"" not ""if.""

personalfinance,Would it be wise to refinance my student loans?,"Hi PF!

After reading a number of threads the past year or so since I've discovered reddit, I decided it's time for me to finally seek some advice in regards to my student loans. Let me start with my background:

Went to a 4 year private university, graduated with a BA in Liberal Studies (essentially, graduated undecided) and Music Performance minor. Needless to say, I didn't pursue a very lucrative degree. I'm currently 28, make just a hair under $50k a year, and still live at home with my parents.

When I went to college, I wasn't really aware of how student loans would impact me in the future. My parents told me ""don't worry about the money, you can just take out loans"" so I just went along with it. Here's my loan breakdowns:

Private Loans:

Loan 1: $23,544.84 balance,	9.75% variable rate
Loan 2: $26,718.48 balance,	5.25% variable rate
Loan 3: $5,469.39 balance, 	8.25% variable rate

Federal Loans:

Loan 1: $1,337.51 balance, 	2.33% fixed rate
Loan 2: $1,595.67 balance, 	2.33% fixed rate
Loan 3: $3,063.06 balance, 	6.8% fixed rate
Loan 4: $3,063.06 balance, 	6.8% fixed rate

These are all through the same lender, so I'm able to make one ""Grand Total"" payment a month which would make the minimums on all the loans. It comes out to about $675 a month and I usually make it an even $700 and add it to Private Loan 1 (with the 9.75% rate now). I know it's not much, but I figure it won't hurt either.

One of my pressing questions would be, is it advantageous in my situation to consolidate at least my private loans? I just registered with sofi.com to see what I could get, and they were able to offer me:

Fixed Rate
Term	       Monthly payment  	Interest rate
15-year	$503.48	                 6.990%
20-year	$442.66	                 7.240%

Variable Rate
Term	       Monthly payment	        Interest rate
15-year	$440.91                	 4.920%
20-year	$375.19	                 5.170%

My take home pay is about $1240 bi-weekly. I've been setting aside $500 per pay for the last few months to save for my wedding later this year. My first paycheck of the month breaks down to $700 to loans, $500 for wedding fund, and the remainder as spending money for gas or any extra expenditures. 2nd paycheck gives me a little leeway in that I set aside the $500 for the wedding fund, about $200 to a cell phone bill (my parents and I in a family plan), then the rest stays in an interest accruing checking account. 

My plan after getting married is to still be able to put aside the extra $500 per pay and put it towards the loans, but I'm almost sure that money will be going towards rent when I move out of my parents' house. I apologize if my post is all over the place, but if anyone can give some insight on how to not be stuck paying these loans until i'm over 50, I'd be really appreciative.

personalfinance,Should I Stay At My School?,"r/personalfinance,

I'm wondering if I should stay at my current school. I recently received my tuition bill and I was short $9,000 in scholarships that I had received last year.

Some background: I'm have three semester left (counting this one. I have also complete three semesters) before graduating with my bachelors in economics and communication. I transferred to a rather expensive, very prestigious liberal arts college after two years at a CC (paid for with federal aid) because I thought I would be receiving nearly a full ride. Tuition at this school is $32,000/year and I would be paying about $2,000 out of pocket. It seemed like a great deal.

After my first semester, my tuition was reassessed and I lost about $5,000 in aid. Apparently because I was receiving scholarships for academics and extra-curricular activities, my need based scholarship dropped to compensate. This left me paying about $5,000/semester. I paid that amount with a student loan and kept going to school.

Not all of my credits transferred, so I have another three semesters left as opposed to just one more semester. 

I just received my tuition bill and it is missing my academic scholarship and extra-curricular scholarship, totaling about $9,000. I'm torn. I don't want to take out another loan to pay $9,000 for a single semester. Also, if my new cost is $9k/semester, it means next year will cost me $18k, bringing my total cost up to $36k for three years at this school. I currently work a part time job off campus to cover my living expenses and do work-study on campus to put money towards tuition (about $1k/semester). I could potentially transfer to a much less prestigious school and receive a full-ride from my extra-curricular activity, but I could only have one year of eligibility left, so I don't know if I could graduate that soon. I also don't want to spend any more time in school than I have to. I hate it. I want to graduate and start my career. However, I also don't want to be stuck with crippling student loan debt.

Any advice would be appreciated.",finance,1423680290
personalfinance,Where's my Refund?,"Hello All,

First off, I'm not sure where to post this but I've been a long time lurker here at PF.  If I'm wrong please direct me to the correct place.  Thanks in advance.

I have a question regarding a refund for the tax year 2013.  I live in NY City and unemployment was my only income for the year of 2013.  I mailed in my 2013 return on 4/15/14 (just in time).  I received a letter around May in the mail stating that there was an adjustment in my Federal return and to expect it to take another 6-8 weeks.  I still have not received anything.  Every time I call the where's my refund hot line it says it can't find anything and I use both the original and the corrected amount.  
I received a text alert from my bank saying that there was a deposit into one of my bank accounts.  This was the one I was receiving my unemployment direct deposit and I thought that maybe that was it.  However, at the time that I received that text alert that account had been closed.  I checked with my bank and they said they have no record of any activity with the closed account.  On top of that I did receive my state refund of a measly $16.  But that check got lost in my wallet and I assume it is now void.  I still have it though.  Does anybody know what I can do? Is there a number I can call?  Can I get that money back when I file my 2014 taxes.  I feel like the government owes it to me and I don't want to pay more taxes if I already have a ""credit"" with them.  

Once again Thank You in advance.",finance,1423680540

Owe federal $700  
State refund $500  

When I filed, I asked for my state refund to be deposited and I would mail a check for federal (which I did not do yet.)  

I then received a 1099 for some contract work that I did in 2014. I created my amended return in my H&amp;R Block software. The result from that was that it said I owed federal $1700 and was to receive a state refund of $100.  

In the meantime, the previous state refund was deposited into my bank account. I haven't touched it.  

Was the $1700 IN ADDITION to the $700 it said I owed earlier to federal? Or is it adjusted? Same with state? Was the $100 refund in addition to the $500 I received? Or will I need to give the $500 back?",finance,1423683582
personalfinance,Net Worth Zero: Day 1 of the Rest of My Life,"Today, for the first time in my adult life, my net worth is not negative. I have as much debt as I do retirement savings, and a hefty tax return (part of which will pay off debt, and part of which I will invest) has officially put me in the black. 

I started out 2014 with over $20k of student loan debt and no savings. I made my first (early) loan payment in June after graduating college and starting a full-time job, and threw every spare dollar I had at the high-interest loans over the summer. I unexpectedly had to move in August, which ate up what modest savings I had in an emergency fund. I took a break in these early payments to rebuild my savings, and started making minimum monthly payments when my post-graduation grace period ended in November. My extra payments resumed in January when I got my year-end bonus. All told I paid off over $10k of high(er)-interest debt in six months by throwing every dollar I could spare at the loans and living as frugally as possible while still maintaining my sanity and social life.

After receiving my tax return today, my net worth is no longer negative. I have two student loans remaining, under $10k total, both with a 3.5% interest rate. Those will be paid off by the end of 2015. I also managed to save about $6k in an employer-sponsored 401-k over the past six months. With my employer's matching funds, that's over $10k in retirement savings. I have a modest emergency fund and a new brokerage account into which I deposited the remainder of my tax refund (~$1k). I'm creating a moderately aggressive portfolio: I don't need the money right now but would like to own a house sometime in the next 5-7 years. Hopefully that $1k will grow into the beginnings of a down payment. 

Per the FAQ here is some advice I would share with others looking to pay down debt quickly, especially recent graduates:

* **Minimize expenses, maximize income.** It's simpler to say than to do, but there are tons of resources on Reddit and elsewhere to help you reduce your cost of living and increase the money coming in. I cook at home, bring lunch to work, shop sales in the grocery store, use dishtowels instead of paper towels, read library books, visit free museums, make my own cleaning solution, have friends over as often as I go out, and choose restaurants with specials and happy hours when I do go out. I sold a lot of my shoes, clothing, and accessories on eBay and Craigslist when I downsized apartments, and also do freelance writing and editing for side income. Use your free time in ways that will either make or save you money, when possible. 

* **Invest in yourself.** When I got my full-time job I was able to move into an apartment of my own, instead of sharing with roommates as I did throughout college. I could be spending less on housing, but it's the one bill I am happy to pay each month. The privacy, sense of peace, creative freedom, social flexibility, and general happiness that my place gives me is well worth what I spend. I'm also not afraid to buy things when I have to: one really good knife replaces my four crappy older ones, one good blazer outlasts two or three cheap ones, and one energy-efficient air conditioner is more durable and costs less month-to-month than the behemoth I inherited from my old place. I started buying quality over trendiness/quantity when I was a teenager, and it's such a great habit to get into. I have shoes, coats, kitchenware, and bedding that I've used for 8+ years still going strong. /r/buyitforlife is a great resource if you want to learn more. 

* **Take advantage of the resources you have.** If you're lucky enough to have family in or near your city, take the support that they offer, whether that's networking introductions or free babysitting or moving back home or the occasional trip to the grocery store. If you have professional mentors or coworkers willing to help you, take them up on their offers to introduce you to new people or write letters of recommendation. If you're in college, use your career center and alumni network to get a job or advance in your career. In my case, that meant working to turn my internship into a full-time job. I asked my mentor for help, set up meetings, pitched myself to senior people, and eventually accepted the offer they made me even though I wasn't sure I wanted to do this long-term. In the end I took the offer because this job would pay well and lead to future opportunities. I'm not doing what I studied in school, and probably won't stay in this industry for more than a couple years, but it was what I had to work with. You might have to choose between following your dreams and getting your financial health in order, and I can't make that choice for you. But what I decided to do was take the opportunity in front of me and try my best at it, knowing that I would be in a much better position to search for my dream job when I had savings, no debt, and a couple years of professional experience. Now that I am employed I use my benefits to the fullest extent possible: tax-advantaged savings accounts, 401-k matches, subsidized transportation, health benefits, discounts, and the occasional free lunch. I also use my downtime in productive ways, studying for new qualifications and reading career-and finance-related books (plus, yes, a little Reddit browsing).

* **Personal finance is a long-term game.** Having goals and dreams has been immeasurably motivational to me. Picturing the house I want to buy one day or the final student loan payment helps me choose not to order takeout, take a cab home, send my laundry out, or buy this or that amazing accessory. It can be hard to make these small decisions every day, but for me keeping my eyes on the prize makes all the difference. /r/financialindependence is very helpful and motivating in this regard.

- I have no dependents.
- I am 20 years old
- I live with my parents
- I made money at my former job and that's it (no deductions,donations, or exemptions)

financialindependence,Variable annuity buyback,"Made some money about 10 years ago.  Part of my investment strategy was a variable annuity (VA).  The VA I selected has a 6% minimum annual return guarantee on the account and also a lifetime stream of income (regardless if account value is depleted).  Those two items put me over the top in moving forward using this VA. I probably would not have gone for a VA if not for those two characteristics (minimum annual return and lifetime payments benefit).  

Yes, I know the VAs rip you off with the fees, and it is a conservative option too (compared to sticking it in index funds).  On the flip side,  I have minimum annual growth of 6% with a possible greater return if the market does well.  Money grows tax-deferred.   I can invoke a lifetime guarantee income stream which is attractive to me.

So to me the VA was a financial backstop and gave me peace of mind that money was going to always be there until me/wife died.  I have other monies maximizing/chasing growth (e.g. index funds, MLPs, dividend growth stocks) in other accounts. 

Well, this VA thing has grown to $1.35M market value...and guarantee lifetime benefit of $1.52M. 

Just got a letter where the insurance company wants to buy me out of the VA for basically the $1.52M amount.  My first thought is....'no'.  If they are offering this, I have a good thing going and they want out of the liability of 6% guarantee and lifetime income stream. Their actuaries probably did not plan properly with our nutty world/interest rate situation and are starting to unwind.  Saw that Hartford got out of the VA market for guaranteed income benefit game.... and they were one of the beasts.  

All the research I did (e.g. blogs, WSJ, trade rags) say don't take the deal.  It is hard to replace the VA feature of lifetime income benefit.  BTW.. I'm 46, no health issues for me or family. No debt. No need for cash at the moment as I still work.

However, if I take the buyout I can recognize the difference between the market value and accrued value.  So the insurnace company will pay me about $150k to let them off the hook for lifetime payments.  The buyout of course will trigger a taxable event (20% tax bill on the gains).

To throw one extra variable in all this....my financial adviser convinced me to put $10k in another competing VA about 10 years ago just to get the contract (b/c the VAs were shutting down the 6% and lifetime benefit guarantee).  So I did. Think I can do a VA 1035 tax-free exchange from the one VA to the other VA w/o a taxable event.  

My head is to do the 1035 transfer.  No tax. Recognize the payoff offer to up my guarantee benefit value base in the new VA; so 6% is the base from there.  Have the same min annual return of 6% with new VA.

First time post, and I've been debating whether to post at all...I'm not a smart man. Will try my best not to post identifying info. Anyhow, here goes:

I currently work at a job where I was making $55k. I used to work a different job in public service about 2 years ago. I recently realized that if I continue doing my current job (IT/office work/extremely small company) I will sink into depression and blah-ness. So I decided to go back to my old work-field. This occupation requires a lengthy application process, and results are not guaranteed, even if you have experience and are fully licensed (which I'm both). In December I decide to tell my boss/owner of my plans. At that point, I was anticipating being hired in my desired field around March 2015 timeframe. In the interest of professionalism/etiquette I decided to inform my aforementioned boss of said decision, since I had already started submitting applications, and fully expected prospecting employers to call him in January to check references and background (in hindsight, I knew I should've waited, but I trusted him to be...nicer? More caring? I don't know and it was dumb I know).

So the day after I tell him, he tells me that he ""expected me to be here longer than 6 months and he won't be able to keep me past the new year"". Yikes. I'm freaking out. After talking to the wife and breathing, I approached the boss with a proposal: keep me on until I find a new job, and you can reduce my salary. So he did. In half. We agreed to the terms, he cut my salary, I still work 8 hours a day, and I'm frantically filling out applications.

Here's my breakdown: approximately $36k in Federal student loans, $26k in a private student loan (!), $144k mortgage, $5700 CC, wife has about $20k in loans herself, and a $2k medical bill from one of my procedures. We just received our tax refund ($9k!!) so we immediately paid off a second CC for $3k, so don't need to worry about that one. I moved $1k into savings for an emergency fund. We were thinking about using the windfall to pay HOA dues early, as well as getting a new (necessary) car seat for our baby (we have 4 kids). We don't have cable, just Netflix and internet. My Federal loans are currently in forbearance until I figure out what the hell I'm going to do. My wife stays at home with kiddos. We're in TX, if that's relevant.

My income: I currently make $27.5k/yr and receive about $1k/month as well (disabled vet comp). We have about $5k in our account right now, and I'm terrified that we're going to spend it improperly, as we've never been the wisest financial planners. I literally JUST downloaded YNAB, but I need some guidance, advice, knocks upside the head, insults, etc...I know that y'all are a bunch of really smarty smart money folks, and right now I wish I had half of those smarts.

The issue is that my current living situation is changing in June and I am having to seek out my own place. Rent is about $800-$900 if I wish to remain in a safe area two miles from work, which would be ideal as my car is unreliable and gets 20MPG. My father fixes and pays for any problems with it and has an older truck I can borrow if need be, so I am driving this car until it dies. The two apartments I've seen so far are in very nice neighborhoods, $895 1b/1ba with cable/internet/water/trash/sewer included, and $875 2b/1ba with water/trash/sewer included. I could possibly find apartments in the $600-$700 range 20 miles from work, costing approximately 3.2 tanks of gas at $130 a month for work travel alone and adding 30 minutes - 1 hour Atlanta commute each way.


Note that I am single with no kids, just a cat. My current plan is to take my tax return and put it towards the $1,500 debt, and to have all the debt besides student loans paid before I move. I'm also not in a career utilizing my bachelors, and have began the career search. I'm not financially savvy at all, which is why I turn to you, /pf. Is it even possible for me to live on my own in four months? I would almost take living in a bad area over finding a roommate, again. What should I be doing and how deep am I?

personalfinance,Should my employer be withholding federal income tax from my paycheck?,"I'm 17 and live at home with both my parents. I have a part time job that pays every 2 weeks. My first year working was last year, and I started at the beginning of July. For 2014, I earned about $1100 after withholdings. My dad (who generally knows his stuff about taxes/finances/etc.) claims that I should not be paying any federal income tax, as I am not making enough to be eligible for it, yet upon doing research of my own I found that the lowest taxable bracket is 10% which covers 0-$9075 in income. I told my dad, and he said to not worry about it and that I still wasn't eligible because of some complicated thing he didn't explain to me. [This](http://imgur.com/5k2h95l) is how I originally filled out my W4. 

At the end of 2014, I mentioned in passing to my dad that federal income tax was withheld from my pay, and he told me that I wasn't making enough to qualify for federal tax. I suspected that I might have filled out my W4 incorrectly. I filled out a new W4 under supervision from my dad like [this](http://imgur.com/gkeAK9m) and submitted it. 

However, on my second paycheck this year I'm still seeing federal income tax being withheld from my pay. Did I still not fill out my W4 correctly? Or is my dad mistaken?

Additionally, I got a 1040 in the mail at the end of January, which my dad says I don't need to submit because 1. taxes have already been withheld from my paycheck and 2. I don't qualify for federal taxes (again). Is this true? Or do I need to submit it?

Side note: I am seeing withholdings on my pay for state income tax, medicare, social security, and unemployment insurance, which I believe is normal.

Edit: additional question after reading through the FAQ. If it turns out that I do need to file/submit my 1040, can I use FreeFile from the IRS instead, or do I still need to submit the physical copy?",finance,1423699845

personalfinance,Please help me obliterate my student loans,"I make 75k a year and i'm roughly 72k in debt from student loans.  I want to pay off my student loans as quickly as humanly possible.  I've read everything in forums and how-to guides for tackling student debt, but I could use some advice on how to take things one step further to expedite this process because some things remain unclear.

My loans are as follows.

20k federal loans at ~5% APR

4.5k private loan at 6.74%

2.6k private loan at 4.74%

23.6k private loan at 7.5%

13.2k private loan at 4.49%

plus another private loan for ~8k (not sure of interest rate at the moment)

(all private loans are variable)

I have asked about loan consolidation with wells fargo, and I can consolidate all of my private loans (~52k) at 6.5% fixed or ~3.5% variable.  I hope to pay off all these loans within 5 years, so would variable be the way to go?  Is it not time dependent and I should just take the fixed and pay it asap?  should i only consolidate the loans above the 6.5%? Should I still pay off the private loans first even though the federal loans seem higher?  My job seems stable so I don't know that I need the deferment cushion that comes with the federal loans, I really just want all this debt off my back.

this brings me to my second point, repayment.  I have an itemized budget that pretty much requires $2500/month to cover rent, max 401k matching, utilities, food, gas, insurances, etc.  the necessities.  This leaves me another $1500 or so every month to work with in order to tackle this debt, random expenses, and well...have a life.

My plan is to pay $500 biweekly with automatic payments.  On top of that, I will maintain a balance of $5000 as a security cushion for emergencies and pay off anything above that to my loans at the end of each month to maintain that balance (this would include any windfalls/increased salary/bonuses).  Some sources say that $5k should be 6 months of living or ~15k, but it pains me to think about 15k in my bank account while my student loans get raped with interest.  Obviously I will pay with the avalanche method.

Does this seem like a sound plan? Is there anything i'm not thinking about?  Any suggestions on how to use tax writeoffs or some other loopholes to expedite my loan repayment? 

Also, since these loans are all above 4%, I should focus on eliminating all of them before I consider investing in other than maxing my 401k matching right?

Lots of questions and detail, sorry for the long post, but I could really use some help tackling this... I'd like to make sure I do it the correct and most efficient way.  As i'm sure everyone in this thread knows, debt is a huge weight.

Please let me know if I omitted any crucial details, and thank you for any help

Edit: I messed up... federal loan interest rates vary 3.4-6.8%.  not sure where I got 9 from.  weighted average looks like its 5.1%.  I can consolidate all ~20k to one loan with 5.125%.  Do I do it?",finance,1423708192

personalfinance,Refining my strategy.,"So I'll preface my post by admitting that the first 7.5 years of my professional career have been an absolute personal finance disaster. I'm an idiot... I know. Credit rating in the dumpster. I just ignored that I had a mailbox for long stretches of time. But I've made it my goal to fix as much as I can this year and already have put in place a plan of action but I wanted to run it by the collective hive mind in here for constructive criticism.  
  
First my very good friend helped me set up a monthly lifestyle budget I've followed so far this year based on receiving (2) paychecks a month. This leaves (2) extra bonus checks in May and October. This budget covers all known living expenses and also includes extra money going towards all of my debt payments from $10-30 over minimum payments.  I make $58,000 - rent is $610  
  
Then I have a lot of debt skeletons in my closet but a couple income bullets in my chamber to fight against those debts.  
  
**debts**  
$20,000 - personal student loan debt  
$45,000 - Student Loan debt I'm taking over for my retiring father  
$3,600 - left on my car loan  
$2,000 - medical bills in 2 collection accounts  
$2,000 - high interest credit cards  
$1,000 - Ohio RITA city taxes I've never filed and have fines on  
$1,000 - an overdraft credit line I over-drafted into debt  
  
**Bullets in the Chamber to fight that debt**  
$2,000 - stocks bought for me from family and cashed in  
$2,000 - tax refund  
$1,500 x 2 - Extra annual paychecks outside of my budget (May &amp; Oct)  
   

**The Plan**  
- Got a new credit card with an interest free grace period till September and transferred the high interest balances onto it. **(DONE)**  
- Cash in the stocks I had in my name and use them to pay off the collections - medical bills on my name **(DONE)**  
- Use my federal tax refund to kill the past due local taxes and kill overdraft account - will do as soon as the refund is deposited in my account  
- Use May bonus check to kill remaining credit card balance  
- Use October bonus check to kill the remaining balance on the car after making payments up until then.  
  
That would leave me with only the Student Loans but I hope to be able to start putting money towards savings and a 401K.  
  
But here's the wild card. I'm starting to have really bad teeth problems. A bad breakage on one side of my mouth has meant I can't chew on that side without serious pain and now I've had a couple teeth have chips on the other side of my mouth. Besides my irrational fear of dentists I have no idea how I will pay for the work that needs to be done. My work offers coverage but only so much....

Financial, tax, payment logistics?","First off, I would like to apologize if this post is misplaced or offensive to anyone. I have read the FAQ and what not but struggled to find any information pertinent to my current circumstances. 

I am a sophomore at a large university. I am a speech-language pathology major. Speech-language pathology majors must attend graduate school in order to legally practice in all but seven US states. I have worked minimum wage restaurant jobs all throughout my semesters for my own supplemental income as my mother has paid for my tuition. I am not working this semester as I am taking 18 hours. (I had to in order to stay on track to graduate in 4 years, which is necessary)

My mom saved up approximately $13k for college for me over the course of 15 years. She makes a $33k a year after taxes salary.  She is divorced from my father, a doctor. I recently learned that my father did not pay child support for the majority of my years under the age of 18. I have found out that he owes her approximately $48k, and that is a low estimate. Neither of my parents have ANY financial acumen as my dad grew up homeless and my mother was in a similar situation. My father is in extreme amounts of debt because of this and is paying large quantities of his income to the IRS. I really don't know the logistics of it, I do not speak to him. 

This is relevant because up until now my father had promised to help contribute to my last 2 years of college. However, he has now backed out. My mom's funds are drained and she can barely support herself. I support myself apart from my tuition via the minimum wage jobs and now just my savings. I am at a loss for what to do, because I am already $10k in student loan debt and I know that even taking out the maximum federal loans I will not be able to cover the entirety of my tuition. 

However, I have an idea: selling my underwear. I know, I know. But I am fairly attractive, 19 years old, and a redhead. Apparently there is a market for this. I am posting in here to inquire about the logistics of these transactions in the event that I do decide to go forward with this plan. 

What form of payment should I use, and how should I receive it safely?

How would I denote this on taxes? 

Would I put this income on my FAFSA?

I've been quietly following this sub for some time and have quietly followed the advice posted by knowledgeable redditors. To start off, I just want to say that I came from a poor family with little knowledge of financial independence since we had none to start with. I was abusing credit cards throughout college and well into graduate school, mostly to party and for medical expenses; (I've since paid them off as of late last year, thank you /r/personalfinance). Now that I have graduated and am in a mature mindset, I want to be able to make the most of my finances so I can be financially independent. Any advice or comment would be greatly appreciated.


Some background, I am 30 years old and will be filing single. Finished my residency last year and made about 58k while in residency, of which 18k is from being an independent contractor (1099). I owe a total of about 245k to student loans, the majority is federal at 6.8% and the small chunk at 5% interest rate.


I have already set up an emergency fund that will last me for a few months. I'm contributing about 7% to my tax savings retirement plan (TSR) through my work, which I believe is similar to a 401K except they don't match. I make around 110k at my new job with another 10k from being an independent contractor. 


I am planning to pay off my loans with the avalanche method, by making bi-weekly payment to the lower 6.8% loan first. Then trickling down.




My questions are:

1) Should I max out my TSR account contribution so I can lower my tax bracket or pay off my loans first while keeping the same 7% contribution

2) Should I even think about opening an IRA (traditional or Roth) at this point? I am in the gray zone for the income limit on Roth.

3) Or Maybe an HSA? I have a high deductible HSA plan for my health insurance, which I have not yet opened. I read about the 'Super Roth' blog and got really interested. If so, where should I open one?

4) What about investing in anything else? I have a betterment account with a $200 auto deposit for a build wealth plan that I'm not sure is even worth it.

5) What's the best way to write off tax or have tax deductions for my income from my 1099 I made last year?

I'm on the fence here and need any input I might be able to get.

I live in Texas and I was married in Q1 of '14. My wife sustained a terrible injury in Q3 of '14 and was (and still is) unable to work afterwards (she can still barely walk or stand, she had a job that required she stand and can no longer stand). We are both 30 years old.

8k in federal student loans (current) -Payment 90

4k left on my vehicle note (30 days late) -Payment 270

$750 capital one credit card (maxed, current on payments) -Payment 30

-numerous collections. approximately 17 in total, totaling 6k) ranging from early termination fees, to small medical collections, to three charged off credit cards, cable bill, charged off conns account, etc.

Wife's debt (all pre-marriage, in wife's name only):

25k remaining on car note (48 months remain and value of car has sunk to 10-12k, payments chronically 30 days late) -Payment 467

7k citi credit card (maxed, payments current) -Payment 300

2k credit card (maxed, payments current) -Payment 100

1k credit card (maxed payments current) -Payment 85

1k credit card (maxed, payments current) -Payment 60

2k credit card (maxed, payments current) -Payment 40

-6 collections totaling approximately 65k. all a direct result of her medical procedure last year. These debts were incurred after we were married, so I assume I'm on the hook for them as well?


In 2013, my adjusted gross income was 34k. 

In 2013, my wife's adjusted gross income was around 18k

In 2014, My adjusted gross income was around 26k and my wife's gross income was around 8k (I assume we'll file jointly, but haven't yet).

Beginning, this year (January) I caught a fantastic job that pays 46k annually and has benefits for me and my wife (very greatful for this). However, my wife can still not work full-time (she works in a small store for about $10 per hour, very part time 10-15hrs/wk.) My insurance is rather expensive through my work as are my mandatory retirement contributions leaving me with $1190 or so every two weeks.

I'm banking on the fact that she (we?) are going to get sued for the 65k in medical bills. I can't afford to pay any more to them as my money left over each month, after bills (I pay about 400/mo in rent), is about $100. I'm in sheer terror of my bank account being levied, being sued, judgements, etc (not so much my wages being garnished - as this is Texas). 

My credit score is currently a 490

Wife's credit score is currently a 605

I'm barely hanging on by a string and am one car repair or minor bill away from having no groceries or gas money to get to work and back.

We've been fortunate enough to move in with family (still have to pay a small amount of rent/utilities). And I'm also very greatful for this.

He decided to buy a house with that large sum and pretty much retire. This semester (spring 2015) I cannot afford to pay for school. I asked my dad and he cant really help out either and so I turned to my schools Financial aid office. 

* They review my file and asked for updates on 2013 tax forms. They determined that since my dad got a large sum I didnt even apply for aid and removed my existing subsidized loans and scholarship aid. Although upset about it I could see how this works, yet to my surprise they also removed the aid I received for the Fall semester of 2014!

Can they do that? They said I must pay all of the balance by Monday or im getting kicked out of school (i have 2 semesters left). I still dont have enough money to pay for school and currently im doing 3 jobs. Im in engineering so i the workload is getting way harder im not sure how long I can do this for. 
ANY advice is more than welcomed.

* Update: Ive emailed my financial aid counselor to ask her on the details of why my aid change so drastically. Like I said thank you all for responding, I'm reading every single comment and thinking of my options. Sometimes I feel reddit is like an older sibling that has my back when I dont know what to do. Its nice to know I'm not completely alone so thank you guys.  

* Update &gt; ""The changes that occurred from the original FAFSA that you submitted per the verification documents were as follows. · Number in Household went from 4 to 3 · Parents 2013 Additional Financial Information total went from 0 to $1500 (this was educational credits from the tax return) ·Parents 2013 Untaxed Income total $8,881, this is tax deferred pension and retirement savings from your parent W-2 With these changes your EFC went from $19,199 to $25,000. Since you now have an EFC of $25,000 you are no longer eligible for need based financial aid funds, therefore your College of Eng Student Scholarship was removed and your Federal Direct Subsidized Loan was cancelled and changed to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The College of Eng Student Scholarship is not a merit based program, this is a need based program and since you are no longer need based eligible this had to be removed for the Fall 14 and Spring 15 semester"" .-email from financial aid office
My brother graduated college last year that's why the household number went down.

* Update: went to their office and they pretty much explained to me in a very bitchy tone the same thing the email described. I got a bit frustrated and told the, I really don't appreciate the fact that they switched my financial aid four days before tuition is due, specially when I turned those forms in a month ago. I feel I shot myself on the foot by asking for help.

* Update: Once again thank you all for your advice, I read all of them and the feedback has been great. I hope my experience can help others and here is my game plan.
* Since im under a strict deadline I will ask to be put on a payment plan tomorrow morning.
* My sub subsidized loans were taken away but they should be replace with unsub, so im going to ask for those back ASAP that should buy me more time
* im going to quit two of my jobs and look for tutoring positions that pay more than double of what I get paid now working for the school
* The storm has passed for now im in a payment plan. I need help my dad do his taxes ASAP so that I can resubmit another review form. I bought myself a month before I cant afford school anymore. Hopefully it will work out",finance,1423745613

personalfinance,"[23M] Evaluate My Budget - Future Plans - Retirement, Savings, House","Personal Details:

23 Years Old. Mechanical Engineer.

Income:

$56k/year+~$1500-$2000 Annual Bonus. General 5-6% raises per year expected barring serious promotion.

~$2600 monthly income post taxes, post 10% 401k contribution, excluding bonus.

Employer matches 100% up to $1000 per year, not a lot, but it is offset with other benefits.

ESOP program, automatically fully invested

Health Care and deductible paid in full by company.

Monthly Expenses:

Rent+Water+Gas (flat fee) - $537.5 (2 BR Apt. split with girlfriend)

Electric - $30 Avg.

Internet - $40

Food - $200

Car Payment (2007 335i - dream car) - $400 (short term 0% APR loan, 2 years left)

Beater Car (2001 Tacoma) - Paid Off

Insurance - $200 (2 vehicles)

Gas - Currently paid for by my father's company.

Cell Phone - Family Plan, my parents lumped it into my monthly car payment that I deposit into their savings

This equates to around $1400/month of expenses, leaving me with ~$1200 or more left over, depending on if I have overtime or not that month.

I have ~$10k in a savings account, and currently $2600 in checking. Student loans are paid off, I am completely debt free minus the car payment, which is owed to my parents. They financed me buying a used car in cash interest free, very nice of them. Credit score is solid, mid 700's and rising. I have a $500 credit card limit, which I would like to increase soon when I find the time to go to the bank.

My main goals are retirement savings and my emergency fund. How large should my emergency fund be? I have not only living expenses, but an expensive to maintain vehicle. I know all of the problems associated with the N54 335i, and I bought it anyway because it's an incredible machine, but there are several ~$1000 repairs that can crop up out of nowhere. Some have been addressed by the previous owner, but I would like to have at least an extra $3000 in the emergency fund to cover these possible expenses. Worst case scenario the BMW can be parked in an emergency, since I have the truck, with which reliability is an understatement.

As far as retirement goes, I have my 401k set to 10% contribution from my paycheck. It sits at around $5000 as of now. I was planning on opening a Vanguard Roth IRA as soon as my nest egg grows to an amount that I'm confident with. Is that a good investment vehicle in addition to my 401k? Or should I look for other investments? Would maximizing my IRA and 401k be enough? Or should I attempt both in addition to some private investments? I wouldn't mind gambling with ten grand or so in the future on certain companies that I find not only profitable, but ethical and innovative as well (like Elon Musk, circlejerk).

There is also the future possibility of a house to look towards. I do not want to find myself handcuffed by making too much in contributions to retirement, where five years down the road I cannot afford the down payment on a house that I want.

I am currently claiming 0 on my W-2, so this could potentially free up some additional income for me, but I have no real interest on playing the zero sum tax game. I am also fairly frugal, but I am not afraid to spend money for a good time. I am serious about saving, but not to the point that I am not ""living my life"" therefore some spending money is necessary in my budget.

TLDR/Final Thoughts

General advice welcome. Is the IRA a good way to go from here? How much should I save for a house?

personalfinance,Second job and business expenses tax question [Taxes],"I am mostly wondering how to be best prepared for next tax season, this year is just an ez for me. I have a full time job where I made a little under 35k gross last year. I was recently hired to a part time job, the way it works is there is a flat hourly rate I can't go below and a fee based incentive. As advertised the job should pay about 20k. When filling out my w4 I saw there was a section for 2 jobs or over 55k, and I think I could be close to this. I filled it out as under 55k. So first of all was that the right move? Am I most likely still going to be using an ez form next year?

Second this job involves some working from home. It would make sense to setup something of a home office and buy some equipment dedicated to this job I e printer, camera, filing cabinet, desk, paper. Are all of those things something I can deduct? What about clothes? I have no use for dress pants or button down shirts aside from this job.

And then lastly I'm being reimbursed $.41 per mile, I think the federal thing is $.56? Can I claim the difference. I'm just not sure how business deductions work and what's reasonable to claim I've  never done it before. Single, not married, no dependents.",finance,1423752129

I'm a 21yr old in rural Western Australia planning on moving to Perth within the next year. I'm working a good job between 40-70 hours a week. Earning between $2160-$3780 before tax per fortnight. At the moment I've set myself a budget of saving 3/4 of each pay and keeping the rest as a weekly allowance.

What I'm wanting to know is whether or not it would be a good idea for me to use the first home builders allowance (around $10,000) and add my savings to it ($10,000 by May, around 20-25k by October) as a deposit on building my own house. Or just to rent my own place when I move to Perth. 

I've had mixed answers from friends/family and I'm planning on having a chat to a few building companies over the next few weeks. Am I too young for this? Or with the interest rates as low as they are, is it the right time for me to build and own my own home?

investing,Get Like Buffett - Rules For Investing,"I’m not a big fan of “invest like Buffett” or “rules for investing like a billionaire.” But here’s six simple rules that are pretty darn good. Again, simple, but hopefully something for everyone. If nothing else, to remind us that investing isn’t all that hard if you have a strategy that works for you and you stick to it. 

**1. Think simple** If it’s an everyday need and embedded in the economy of daily life, chances are it is represented in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway, which is big on insurance, utilities, energy, railroads, retail, finance and manufacturing. Familiar “grocery cart” brands reflect timeless consumer needs, and that translates to the steady, long-term growth Buffett values. Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings include insurer GEICO, battery maker Duracell and financial services firm Wells Fargo. If you use it all the time, you may want to own a slice of it.

**2. Find the core value** Companies constantly complicate their financial reports with one-time ""extraordinary expenses."" You may not have an army of number crunchers at your disposal like Buffett, but you can learn basic indicators of core value. So what’s a ""core asset?"" It’s what you’d buy if you purchased the company, such as real estate, inventory and intellectual property. Track the ""book value per share,"" which typically reflects the firm's core value compared with its current stock price.

**3. Turn off the news** Buffett knows that no long-term good can come of reacting to today’s economic news. Instead, follow Buffett’s lead and think a few steps ahead of today’s headlines. You can’t guess exactly what the government, the Federal Reserve and the market will do, but you know in general that, say, the government will act to stabilize the economy. That's where the opportunities are.

**4. Know the basics** Once you get a grip on the book value, find out how much money the company makes with its assets. Buffett looks for a consistent 20 percent return on assets. That cuts out a lot of companies. Also examine trend lines. A company that used to return 10 percent on assets and now returns 20 percent is headed in the right direction. Warren is interested in why.

**5. Be patient** Do you have your eye on a few companies that seem to fit the Buffett mold? Monitor them, to see how well they make money and how their stock price is valued. If the company consistently makes money but its stock price is out of whack with its book value, you may have detected a good candidate to buy and hold. 

**6. Don’t be afraid to pull the trigger, but stay the courser** Buying and holding builds long-term wealth, even though many investors try to score on immediate market opportunities. Buffett buys to hold forever. He has described his investment style as 'lethargy bordering on sloth,'. If your horizon isn’t quite as eternal, plan to stay in your investments for at least five years. The market has proven that it takes at least that long to ride out a cycle. It needs time to grow.",finance,1423754136

personalfinance,Options for consolidating/refinancing student loans?,"I live in Europe together with my girlfriend who from the USA. She is paying off her student loans, and i am interested to learn if we can save some money by consolidating/refinancing the loans.

The loans are private student loans at Chase Bank currently with a total of about $30.000. We have been paying more than the minimum payments and plan to pay it off in about 10 years.

One of the loans is about $5.000 and has an interest rate of 6% while the remaining $25.000 has an interest rate of 3%.

My girlfriend tells me that whenever she cannot make a payment to an individual loan and of each payment 50% of that goes towards paying off each loan. How is that possible? It would of course be preferable to pay of the loan with the higher interest rate more quickly.

What would be the next step here? I have seen some online articles suggesting that you ""shop around"", but I am not sure exactly where and how.

I have found for example Citizens Bank online calculator, but it is targeted at calculating ""monthly savings"" (where you ""save"" more by taking longer to pay off) but that is not what I am after, and also makes me distrustful of contacting banks, as I only trust them to act in their own self interest, so I would like to get some more opinions here first.",finance,1423756338

- Should show me all of my scheduled payments (monthly)

Most resources say I should make my extra payments to pay off the 3000 at 5.6% first as it is the highest interest rate. However it would seem more logical to me (a person with no background in interest accumulation mathematics whatsoever) to pay down the loan accumulating the most daily interest until it equals the next highest daily interest amount, and then pay them in tandem until their daily reaches the third and so on.

personalfinance,Unusual State Tax Audit––Advice/Wisdom?,"I am in an unusual situation with a state audit (NY) for taxes in 2010.

In 2010 I was married, and my very controlling then-wife wouldn't let me touch any of our tax materials.

It turns out, we never submitted any returns for NY State in 2010, and now NY State has served us both (separately) with an audit entailing roughly $800 in taxes owed and $800 in fees. As far as I can surmise, this is based on us filing federal returns jointly, but I haven't been able to get my hands on a transcript of our 2010 Federal returns yet (I'm hoping to get a copy soon). 

The problem is that my ex-wife literally won't talk to me/do anything to fix this, and she's basically just not dealing with it. So, this puts me in a bind, because at the very least I don't know how to communicate to the NY Auditing group the issue or if there is a way to only have to pay my part. On the other hand, in 2010 I made 24,000 dollars and I'm certain I paid all of my taxes, so if I could file individually, I'm sure that I wouldn't owe anything at all. She made something like 40,000 at various jobs and has, I think, 4 or 5 W-2's from that year, including some independent work that I think is what presents the tax issue. 

If there is some advice/wisdom to this that I am missing, I'd appreciate any advice from anyone learned in the arts of taxes. But I specifically am curious about answers to these questions:

Can I re-file my federal and state taxes for 2010 as ""married filing separately"" and bypass this issue altogether? If so, is that something that I can ask an accountant to do without being a crazy/weird request?

Do I have any way to make a designation with the NY State office about the issue with my ex-wife? I'm afraid that I'm just screwed at this point, but do I have any legal-type options?

Finally, I first got word about this in the late Fall––should I file my 2014 taxes now or should I wait until this is settled?

personalfinance,Trying to decide how to best use my tax return.,"I'm 26 years old, working my first ""real"" job after bouncing around after graduating college. I'm going to be getting back $1,900 this year. My monthly budget is pretty tight. No credit card debt, but I have a car payment and some major student loans. I'm currently paying the minimum on all except for the one with the highest interest rate, which I'm putting extra towards. I have a savings account with a pathetic interest rate. Not a ton saved yet, but it's there.

So I'm trying to decide how to best apply the $1,900 I'll have. I thought about putting it towards my student loans, but I'm thinking the short-term cash flexibility is more valuable than what a single payment would do in the long term. I also thought about putting it in my savings account as part of an emergency fund, but the interest rate is so low that that I'd essentially be losing money by letting it sit there versus paying off student loans.

Which brings me to another option I'm considering after seeing it casually mentioned in another subreddit: buying stock. In a fashion subreddit someone asked what they could do with $500, and someone said ""buy 4 shares of AAPL."" And I'm wondering if doing that myself would be totally dumb.

My parents have Apple stock and have made a decent amount from it. I also am a huge Apple fan and have managed an Apple repair shop, so I follow them closely.

personalfinance,Need Advice - Student Loans woes,"Hi PF - long time lurker, first time poster. 

So, I am a recently engaged lady and will soon be moving in with my fiance. One thing that I am struggling with is my Student Loans and my best course of action. I went to law school, passed the bar, and intentionally went into the HR field (I know, I know). 

My student loans are all federal, and are currently sitting around $123,000. I am utilizing Income Based Repayment and I am currently paying $401 per month, which doesn't even cover my monthly interest (around $655). 

The way I see it, I have two options: 1) start aggressively paying down my debt, using either the avalanche or snowball methods. I estimate that if I put $1400 per month towards these loans, I could pay it off in 10 years - is that accurate? OR 2) Pay the IBR minimums set each year, based on my income, and then after 25 years of payments, pay a huge tax bill on the outstanding amount. 

I am no accountant, so my rough go at the numbers had me at $425,000 of debt after 25 years (if I just keep paying minumums, estimated to be $500 per month). If the $425,000 is taxed at 30%, that year I would be stuck with a $100,000+ tax bill, in addition the the 25 years of payments I have been making. Am I even close to the right numbers and estimates?

I am currently saving for a wedding and for a house - I have been saving $1,000 per month for a house for the last year. I have a nagging suspicion you all will (rightly) tell me to put that towards my loans immediately. 

Also, to compound the situation, my fiance was recently laid off, making our finances a little tighter. I am fully confident that within the next month or two he will find something, but it is a consideration at the moment. 

These are the current breakdown of my loans:

Total: $122,429.40

Loan #1: $8,533.37 (Interest Rate 6.8%)

Loan #2: $16,024.56 (IR 6.8%)

Loan #3: 9,622.89 (IR 8.5%)

Loan #4: 10,660.10 (IR 8.5%)

Loan #5: 8,533.35 (IR 6.8%)

Loan #6: 15,112.36 (IR 6.8%)

Loan #7: 14,004.74 (IR 7.9%)

Loan #8: 19,110.16 (IR 7.9%)

Loan #9: 8,533.35 (IR 6.8%)

Loan #10: 12,294.52 (IR 6.8%)


My questions:
1) What is the best way to pay this off? 
2) Are my numbers that I estimate above close to the real thing? (10 years at 1400 will pay it off vs. 25 years and it grows to $425,000??)
3) Should I be putting all of my money to repayment, forsaking my house fund?

I really appreciate the help and any advise. I am overwhelmed, and looking back, I would not recommend Law School to someone who knows that they don't want to use it in the traditional sense.

I know I was stupid. I fell into an anxiety induced depression about money (and other things) about 4 and 1/2 years ago to the point where I lived off of temp jobs and put everything on credit cards. I finally got a real job a year and a half ago, but I am still stuck in this cycle. Please be kind. It was a stubborn ass and just trying to survive. Anyway, I know if I can get my debt under control I can start working on a business idea that I love and eventually pay it all off. I know bankruptcy is an option, but I want to try everything else first.  

What are my options? (I am looking for part time work. I do random stuff to make money like babysitting occasionally. I am moving out of my apt in July when the lease is up to look for a cheaper place. ($1130 per month) I am in line for a promotion when a co-worker retires in July-ish. I am getting a slight raise in June)



Do I just call and ask for a lower minimum payment? Do I mention that I've been a good customer? Will that set off any red flags? I can't have my cards shut down. Otherwise how will I live? 

I've tried just being as frugal as possible, but every time I do something comes up and ruins all my progress. I just want to know that I am paying off my debt. Even if it's at a snails pace. I just need some hope.",finance,1423770537
personalfinance,Salary has flatlined for too long. Recruiters keep asking about salary. What do I do to get more?,"Background: Second job. I've been working at the same company for 5 years.

I'm shooting for jobs with my experience that pay roughly around 75k-85k. How do I get this?

I had an interview today where the recruiter said point blank ""You have to tell me your salary or I'm afraid we can't move much further."" Additionally, the reported salary average on glassdoor was at 84k. When I said I wanted that she hesitated and restated ""Well, what do *you* think is reasonable?""

Then I get errors and last year I had a long rejection that took several months to fix (they fixed it for me without explaining). I've tried googling, going to H&amp;R Block, to no avail.

Here is the situation with some generic numbers.
Federal: $100,000
IL Wages: $100,000
IL Tax: $5000
NE Wages: $4000
NE Tax: $200

Every year it seems that the issue is the Illinois Schedule CR (credit for taxes paid to other state).  It's always ""Line 1a - 1b = W2 Box 16"".  Basically Federal Wages - NE Wages = Illinois Wages.  However, my Illinois Wages are equal to my federal wages thus its mathematically impossible.

I tried calling the IL Tax help line and they told me because my company's base of operations is in IL, they tax all income and I don't get any credit for taxes paid to other states.  But this seems like I'm getting double taxed?

I also called turbotax and they didn't know what to do either, and the guy just told me to just put down a different number for IL Wages (-$4000) but this seems illegal?

personalfinance,Should I hire an attorney to help me with my student loan issue? Do attorneys even handle things like student loans?,"Hi everyone- this is my first time posting here, so please forgive me if I have broken any rule! I read the FAQ and new user orientation, so hopefully I am doing this right. 


I am one of those people that has above-average student loan debt. Currently, it hovers around 100k- and that's only for a bachelor's degree. I read another discussion about how people are chastised for this, but believe me- I know how terrible my situation is. I really do. While there is nothing anyone can say to me that I haven't thought myself, please know that I feel terrible about this situation and I am just trying to do my best to get out of it. So with all of that said, here goes: 

I had some MAJOR issues when I first went to college, and wound up being put on scholastic dismissal. I took out student loans to go to college, but I flunked out of every single class. I didn't want to admit this much, but I will say that it was a combination of two things- cluster headaches and severe mental health issues - that led to me flunking out of school. I didn't work or do anything for years after this occurred. My student loans went into default. 

One day, I get a phone call from one of my lenders, who offers a reconsolidation program. This will get my loans out of default, and will allow me to go back to school. At this point I had no education, no job experience, and I was in my 30s, so I thought that going back to finish my degree was the best choice. At the very least, I would have SOMETHING to show for all of that debt. 

So I applied for readmittance into my University. I was accepted, but it was hell, because I was always fighting those damn semesters that I flunked out of. In other words, no matter how great my grades were in the present, I was continually on scholastic probation and being threatened with getting kicked out of school because my GPA wasn't high enough. It's also worth noting that I applied for more student loans after I was accepted. 

At this point, I applied for a retroactive withdrawal for all of those classes I flunked out of, and it was EXTREMELY difficult to pull that off. One of the things I learned from going to a major University is that the bigger an institution is, the less the individual matters, and they were no exception. At any given point, I was dealing with at least 5 different departments- my dean's office, the registrar, the mental health center, the students with disabilities office, and the student medical center- none of them communicated with each other, either, so the process was incredibly slow- it took several semesters to complete the process entirely. And in the meantime, that threat of being kicked out was always hanging over my head. The dean's office ignored the student's with disabilities suggestions that I only take a certain number of hours one semester, and forced me to take more classes than I could handle. Luckily, the retroactive withdrawals were approved that semester, but only after working with the ombudsperson's office to help these departments communicate with each other. After I was approved, I was able to drop the extra classes. My GPA skyrocketed from below a 1.0 to above a 3.0. The problem, though, is that my student loans that semester were for X number of hours, and I dropped below that. That got me in trouble with the student loan office. 

Here is the issue: I feel as though the university is responsible for some of the student loan debt that I incurred, because I retroactively withdrew from several semesters. The university had to pick a day that I withdrew way back when, and the dates they picked were after tuition could be reimbursed. 

In other words, let's say that the withdrawal deadline for a 100% refund was March 5th, 1999. When picking a withdrawal date for me, they chose a date that fell AFTER that deadline had passed. I am of the opinion that they could have very easily picked a date that fell before March 5th, which would have meant that they would have to reimburse tuition - which in my case, would have been the federal government. Pell grants, etc, didn't cover all of my expenses- at least part of my tuition was paid for with loans. On top of this, I have an issue with the semester where I was forced to take more classes than recommended by the student's with disabilities office. 

I know this was a longwinded story, but I included the part about my experiences with the university so that I could demonstrate how difficult it is to get anything done there. I don't believe that this is as simple as walking into the financial aid office and asking about this - mainly because there are several departments involved- the registrar, the dean's office, the financial aid office, etc. The last time I dealt with these guys, I needed an ombudsperson to work with all of these departments as my advocate. 

So my question is: Are there attorneys that handle things like this? Or anyone in the community that I can turn to that will help me deal with these departments on my behalf? 

Any help would be really appreciated, and thank you very much for reading!

personalfinance,Can my mother steal my college fund?,"So to start off, I'm not sure whether or not this is the right sub; I'm going to assume so because this is fiances. So lets begin.

My mom was pretty cynical, she drank, stole and committed several counts of fraud while I grew up. She lied to get drugs and so on. Me and my sibling moved out a few years ago to live with our dad because we couldn't take her shit anymore. That being said, she disowned us. Stopped talking to us, stopped texting and calling, and told our family that my sister was pregnant, we were both on heroin and I sold drugs. My sibling turned 18 last year and was so fed up with our moms shit that she didn't bother asking about our college fund. 

However.. I'm graduating this year and I plan on going to college. That college fund contained over $20,000. My grandparents are rich and put a lot of money in, and so did my mom. I remember growing up she would tell us that its in our name so our dad cannot steal it (irony, she stole his money for over a decade) and whenever we asked to have money from it to buy stuff she would say, ""You can't take money out until you're 18"". Here's the problem. My sister will not talk to her so she probably already assumed we forgot about it or didn't want it or something. I plan on getting every penny but I honestly have no idea how I could go about it. 

I was planning on just showing up at her door when I graduate, with a hidden camera to film it, and film everything she says in case she said she spent it all. The week we moved out she bought a new car and went to Hawaii, so the feelings pretty strong that she stole it. Is it possible? If not how do I get the money back?",finance,1423777683

I'v been a lurker here for a while and haven't ever posted except for a comment reply a couple weeks ago.

The comment that I replied to is actually what sparked this question for me.

I currently have 4 credit cards

Credit Union - $904 @ 12.99%
Barclaycard - $2365 @ 24.99%
Capital One - $281 @ 19.8%
Lowe's - $1677 @ 24.99%

I pay on each of my cards roughly $200 each every month but things come up and I end up having to use them. I'm currently working on not using them at all anymore and paying them off completely

My question is what is the best way to repay these to pay the least in interest.

I know that the Avalanche method works well, where I would pay off the ones with the highest interest first.

But the thing that I question about this method is that say I pay my barclay card down, which is the one with the highest interest rate. Once I get to a certain point I will be paying more every month in interest on my Credit Union card even though it has a lower interest rate

I'm a software developer and I write code every day for a living so I was trying to come up with a formula that would take how much I have to pay each month and then determine how much should be paid on what card.

If anyone has any advice on how to calculate this I would greatly appreciate the help and advice.",finance,1423777833

technology,Mike Lee is trying to circumvent the FCC Title II classification by outright lying to people.,"This came in my email today:

""Dear Friends,

Obamacare, the VA scandal, the IRS scandal--these are just a few examples of what happens when we give government huge power without oversight. 

It's about to happen again--the Obama Administration is fighting for a government takeover of the Internet and the Federal Communications Commission is going to vote on it February 26th. That's why I am writing you today--I need your help to stop this.

President Obama came out a few weeks ago urging the FCC to vote to regulate the Internet the same way that it regulates public utilities under Title II. What this means is that, for the first time, billions of dollars in fees will be attached to Internet service just like they are to telephone service. 

You see, under Title II if someone wants to own a telephone company, there are fees baked into the law--fees companies pass on to customers. 

Now, under this new regulatory regime, Internet service providers will be subject to these fees as well, and then pass them on to you, the consumer. 

This is essentially a massive tax increase on the middle class, being passed in the dead of night without the American public really being made aware of what is going on. 

The Internet is built on speed and dynamism, it’s always changing, there are always new and better ideas that are exploding onto the scene, and part of the reason for that is that innovators are not having to go ask Washington, DC for permission every time they want to do something new. 

What this really comes down to is a fundamental question:

Who do you want in charge of the direction of the Internet: people at dot-com startups that brought us game changing companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon and Uber; or nameless, faceless, unelected bureaucrats in our nation’s capital?

There is another aspect of this that gets overlooked: the Internet is an incredibly important force for freedom, for liberty, and the rights of free speech that we hold dear. It is an existential threat to tyrants in countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Russia who seek to keep information from their people. 

We must preserve the high ground for the United States to stand up to these countries and tell them to keep the Internet free and preserve free speech on the Internet throughout the world. We cannot do that if we are regulating the Internet in a similar manner ourselves. 

I am not accusing anyone of sinister motives here, but I am deeply concerned about the idea of any government bureaucrat having the power to tell companies what they can and cannot do. In the long term, this could have a chilling effect on political speech, in ways that today we could not even begin to imagine. 

We do not have much time left to stop this gigantic government takeover of the Internet. The FCC is voting on February 26th and the Left is mobilizing to support their effort to do so. We cannot let the conversation be totally one-sided. The FCC needs to hear from us today--not tomorrow or next week or next month. Today.

Please join me and go sign the petition to keep the Internet free. We must stand for liberty and preserve the Internet free of government interference. 

Thank you for standing for Internet freedom. 

Sincerely,

Senator Mike Lee

Unfortunately, I've had some significant dental problems and my only option to start correcting the problems was to put the cost (around $16k) on a CareCredit card whose interest rate is somewhere around 24%.

Despite our relatively good credit situation, I don't have enough to pay more than our minimum monthly payment of $590 so the balance doesn't really budge. We looked at refinancing our home and letting that absorb the cost. That fell through as we couldn't get enough out of the equity to absorb the cost.

1. Would it be better to get a credit card with a lower interest rate and transfer this debt to that and pay it off that way?

personalfinance,Alternative to Lending Club etc.,"I'm 24, I have a $5500 of credit card debt and a stable take home income of around $25000 a year after taxes and 401k etc. My credit score is in the mid 600s and I've had an account go to collections in the past year. 

I cannot get financed by Lending Club or one of those because of my credit score and the collection, so im looking for an alternative solution to pay off the debt (much of it is at around 23%) and consolidate into one loan with interest around 12%. 

My parents don't have any money so I can't ask them. 

What other alternatives do I have? I don't own anything of value that I could use as collateral, but I'm frustrated with paying such high interest rates.  I already put my xmas bonus and tax refund towards the debt, but won't have any other extra income like that until next year.

personalfinance,Advice to better my auto debt situation,"Hi there all. Im fairly new to this subreddit and i hope this is the right place to post! 
So: I currently have a $12,000.00 payout figure on my 2008 car. The monthly repayments of apprx $350 are the main problem in my budget, and a major barrier to improving my financial health. I bought the car 2nd hand about 4 years ago for $18,000.00, and I stupidly got finance through the dealer at 14.9% over 7 years. Due to some periods of unemployment etc, my loan period has extended by about 15 months. Current market value for car seems to be around $10,000. So right now, on my limited income, I'd love to find a way to continue to have a car (needed for my work), but possibly a smaller older car, with much smaller repayments. I have a bad credit history so refinancing isn't really going to improve the interest rate, but I'm wondering if car yards would trade in the vehicle and put me in a much cheaper car, without me losing more than a couple of thousand dollars (my savings sit at around $1500).

personalfinance,Need advice: Hardship program or settlement?,"Barclaycard has offered me two programs that may help me, because I have been delinquent in payments for about 80 days.

I'm past due for $385.59, with a balance of $2,526.75. Interest is 23.99%.

1) Hardship Program: Payments are reduced to a minimum of $32-$50/month, no late fees, interest is lowered to 8%, and the program lasts for 10 months. At any time during the Hardship program I can opt in to go for the Settlement instead. Also closes the account, not that I care 'cause I don't want it anyways.

2) Settlement for 70%. To be paid within 90 days of opting in.

They told me that if I take the settlement, I will have to account for the amount unpaid as income for next years taxes. It will also show up on my credit report as a settlement.

I'm leaning towards the Hardship program because of the lowered interest rate. I don't intend on paying just the minimum though. If I have 10 months with a lowered interest rate, I could pay about $252.68/month, and have it paid off in the 10 months.

However if I go with the settlement, I can use my tax refund and pay off the whole thing now. I'm just concerned about the tax and credit repercussion. I really just want to get rid of this debt as soon as possible.

In any case, I can always choose to pay the past due balance, and continue making payments as normal. At that point though, it makes sense to take the Hardship program.

I'm so done with being in debt.

personalfinance,Advice please! Saving money through student loan consolidation with private &amp; federal loans,"I posted here once before and your feedback was very helpful. I'd like to share what was recommended, what I learned since, and where I am now. Any input is very much appreciated.


Current student loans, all serviced by Navient:
Private: Signature Student Loan - $29,500 at 10.75% [the bane of my existence]
DoE Loans: Stafford Loans - $15,000 total at rates from 5.75% to 6.55%
Federal: Stafford Loans - $7,000 at rates from 6.3% to 6.8%


The DOE bough their portion of my loans after I graduated. All loans were created with Sallie Mae but are now Navient.


Because of my horrible, soul-crushing 10.75% loan, it was recommended that I can chip away at it and save money on interest by doing a balance transfer to a credit card during its promotional 0%/no-fee period. 


I was approved for a Chase Slate card, and because I have other accounts with Chase, I was able to transfer available credit to that account and get a limit of $8k. 


The problem is, the balance transfer checks required to do this don't come for at least 6 months after opening the account. That means that whatever I transferred would only be at 0% for under a year. For all of the hassle of transferring, paying Navient and Chase, etc, it wouldn't save enough to be worthwhile, so I canceled the Chase Slate account. [As a plus, I got to keep the $2k+ additional credit limit and add it to my other Chase account.]


I can do the balance transfer with a 3% charge to another Chase account, but it's not as worthwhile when it's not no-fee/0%.


Okay, so that's the first part. The next part is consolidation. I applied to DR Bank because they offer low rates and they allow you to consolidate private loans and federal loans together. I was just rejected on my initial application. It's frustrating because I have very good credit and an excellent loan payment history. I'm still awaiting details, but it sounds like my co-signer wasn't good enough.


If I get rid of my federal loans, I think I might have more luck refinancing just the private loans because more providers offer refinancing for just private loans. But to do that, I'd be paying off my lowest interest loans first, which makes no sense according to the avalanche payment method. If it helps, I have enough in savings to pay off the federal loans in full very soon. I don't know if the DoE stafford loans count as private or federal (or neither?).


Short of turning back the clock and punching 18-year-old me in the face for signing a 10.75% compound interest loan agreement, what do you recommend as the next step? Should I apply to other loan consolidation companies? Has anyone had a good experience with their student loan consolidation process?


As a side note, reading the /r/personalfinance FAQ has been hugely helpful. I now have over $5k in savings as an emergency fund. I'm also working on saving money by changing auto insurance providers, and I negotiated my Comcast account down by approx. $60/month. Saving money feels so good!

The bump in pay each week didn't draw her attention because she also got a raise near the beginning of 2014.

Bitcoin,"What bitcoin needs: decentralized QE, and why it won't happen.","Bitcoin has lost 80% of its purchasing power in the last 15 months. This is an inescapable truth. Somehow we all know this but we are pretending it does not matter.

If this were the fiat world, it's like saying, 15 months ago a loaf of bread was $1, and now it costs $5. Another way to put it, is that 15 months ago, if you wage was the equivalent of $10/h (in btc), then now your wage is $2/h (in btc). If you put savings into bitcoin in the last 15 months, then on average that savings has dwindled. If you have invested in bitcoin in the last 15 months, then on average you have made a bad investment. 

Somehow, even with deflationary currency, we are seeing a devaluation that is only seen in the inflationary fiat world when a currency is on it's way to becoming [worthless.](http://i.imgur.com/5gYydh7.png)

If any other money supply devalued like this, people would be calling bloody murder in the streets, getting ready to hang the bankers. Well, who are the bankers in bitcoin?

But how does one go about QE with bitcoin, when you can't just arbitrarily print more, and we have no real system of investments (borrowing, lending, reserves, interest rate related commodities, bonds, etc)?

The closest we could come to it would be that for those who accept bitcoin, a flat % costs savings would have to be passed on to the customer, and that savings % would have to be paid back to the seller through some other authority, perhaps a decentralized bitcoin futures scheme that actually held massive reserves. This type of ""decentralized yet central"" authority is bordering on the concept of a standard financial corporation where shareholders vote - but it's the best thing I can think of.

Now, what possible incentive would anyone have to set such a scheme up? None, unfortunately, as crypto is not too big to fail. With QE, the incentive is to keep the economy afloat, stave off uncontrolled inflation / deflation, and generally to keep a country running. With bitcoin, there is no real detriment to it's failure - we can simply all switch back to using FIAT, and keep on running whatever business we are running without losing anything of value in the long run. 

Knowing that bitcoin *can* fail, and that with its failure nothing major will change in the world, means that we choose not to take it seriously enough to intervene in its design parameters. ""All hail satoshi's wisdom"" leaves the decentralized mass paralyzed - unable to even fathom a central authority that can make changes other than releasing the latest version of wallet software few even use.",cryptocurrency,1423852205

My uncle just recently came forward with a check for $6k for myself, my sister, and my cousin (who work for the company still). He wants us to use the money he gifts us to buy him out.  
Now: my sister is a doomsday prepper with two kids and a husband with PTSD. They cannot save anything. Literally within two days of getting their 6, they bought three guns.  
My cousin showed up with a new truck.  
I wish I was lying.  
I'm a 29yr old with Multiple Sclerosis, I don't want this money getting away. So now here's the question:  
How best to make this $6,000, and whatever subsequent gifts Uncle-Racist gives us (while his generosity lasts), turn into more. I know that interest rates are depressingly non-existent, so is a CD my best option?

personalfinance,Subsidized Student Loan Put in Deferment - any downsides to this?,"Hello folks, I have a question regarding a student loan deferrment (due to me being back in school)... the loan is subsidized, but does interest compound during the deferment period?

Let me elaborate...

Background:
I have a BA and MA, both earned in the last 4 years. I accumulated 51k in federal loans, some sub &amp; some unsub, with interest at 6.8% for almost every loan group. Most loan groups are managed by Nelnet (~48.5k), one loan is managed by Navient (~2.5k). I pay more than the min every month for these loans, no problem.

Last month, I enrolled at a community college to get an associate's in web dev. Tuition is insanely cheap, so I pay out of pocket. I have a decent entry level job now based on my BA &amp; MA (~60k/yr) but having this additional degree in web dev would be great in terms of career growth and also side projects I have mapped out, plus I enjoy it a lot.


Current Situation:
Yesterday I got an email from Navient (manages the $2.5k fed loan @ 6.8%), saying that my application for deferment had been approved... except I never applied for deferment. I called Navient &amp; they explained that my community college had notified them that I was a student(???). Navient confirmed that the loan is subsidized and the next payment isnt due till 2016.

My thinking is that since this is a subsidized loan, i can leave it in deferment till 2016 &amp; instead, I can just start redirecting payments I would have made to that one Navient-managed  loan and target specific loan groups with Nelnet.... and I wouldnt have worry about interest accumulating with Navient during this deferment period.... on the surface, this sounds good, from a strategic standpoint.

But I wonder... will interest be compounded during the deferment period? I tried googling and didnt find anything that actually makes sense to me... I was hoping someone here had a clearer answer? **Is there any downside to this deferment, particularly as it factors into attacking the bulk of my student loan debt currently not in deferment?** And if this is a good thing, should I check with Nelnet to see about doing the same thing with those loans... just to avoid interest payment for the subsidized loans with Nelnet, as a way to direct more money towards principle? 

Thank you so much for your help.

personalfinance,"My car broke down, and I need to get a replacement immediately! (and don't have much savings).","I've known I needed a new car for a while, and have been planning on saving up and buying one this summer.  However,my current car just started having some issues, and It's become apparent that I need to buy a new vehicle fairly quickly. (My old car has high miles, and is worth less than $1,000, and costs of repairs would be $1,000 at a minimum). My current car is drivable, but is definitely on it's way out. I use my car for driving to work, so need to get a new vehicle quickly (ideally within a week) I've never bought a car before (I've had my current car since I was 16), and have some questions. 

I'm looking for a replacement car immediately. I currently have about $800 in my bank account, and about a $200 balance on my credit card, no other assets or debts. I spoke to my bank, and they said with my credit score, they said they could get me a loan with about a 6% apr, for a 12-48 month loan. However, they also said that the loan would be for a minimum of $5,000, and needs to be spent on a car that is newer than 6 years old, and less than $90,000 miles. The type of car I want (AWD, some storage space), would be fairly expensive that new, and I was initially looking at some thing that was closer to 7-12 years old, and around $3-7,000 (or even cheaper). However, it appears I can't get a loan that would work with that. 

Here's some background info:  I currently have a job as an independent contractor with a few different companies. The main company I work for has fairly steady work for me, that I can take on as much as I want. This is a pretty ideal situation for me at this point, since I have fairly low expenses, and like to take time off to travel. So, while I don't have a ""steady"" job, I work full time when I want, and they are very happy with my work, with lots of work available, so it should keep going that way for a while. Also, I've got other smaller contracts that I work on occasionally, that could expand if needed. So while I don't have a “steady” job, I have a fairly stable income of about $4,000 a month, with expenses of about $1500 a month. However, I just started this work after a period of traveling, so have quite low savings (hence why I originally planned to save up a few months before buying a car). 

So, here are my my questions (TLDR, if you will):

Is it common for car loans to specify that the car must be less than 6 years old, below 90,000 miles, and cost more than $5,000 (or similar specifications)? 

I would prefer to buy a car off craigslist (cheaper, more options), but would it be worth going to a dealer instead in order to get financing?

I have very little cash on hand, but a fairly good income, with low expenses. I was initially planning on purchasing an older car (from 7-12 years old), that was in the 3,000-7,000 dollar range. I don't need anything fancy, but have a few requirements (storage space, AWD). However, I don't have the cash on hand to purchase a 3-7,000 dollar car, but it appears that a loan will only allow me to purchase a more expensive car. Another option is to use a “personal line of credit” loan, but that comes with fairly high interest rates (10-12%). Should I just purchase a newer, more expensive car?

I'd prefer to buy a cheaper car, and have less debt, what is the best way to do this with financing?

I plan on using a significant portion of my income for the next few months to pay off the loan quickly (within 6 months), is that wise?

Are there any other options I am overlooking?

I am a grad student, 23 years old. I'm supported by a graduate research fellowship. I get a stipend; it is reported as scholarship income in a 1098-T, not as earned income (no W-2).

I sold some stocks this year to consolidate what I had. I'd been investing income from internships in college and later a portion of my grad school stipend. The long-term capital gains are a few thousand dollars. I thought this wasn't a big deal because I am in a 0% federal long-term capital gains bracket.

I was doing my taxes on TurboTax, and it started asking about my parents' income. I'm not their dependent and claimed my personal exemption last year and will continue to do so. TurboTax was wanting to fill out Form 8615 http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8615.pdf . I read the form and started to get concerned.

Furthermore, my parents helped me out with a big medical expense this year, about $1000 (which is less than the total amount I paid in medical bills). I think that means they provided that in ""support"" to me. So since I didn't have ""earned income"" (even though I sure did work a lot on research this year), and I am a full-time student, and I am under age 24, it is sounding like 8615 applies to me.

It describes unearned income as including interest, ordinary dividends, capital gains, and taxable fellowship grants not reported on Form W-2. The way I'm reading this, it sounds like all my income (past $2000) would have to be taxed at my parents' tax rate (much higher than mine).

This is kind of freaking me out. Can someone help shed some light on this? What can I do?

TL;DR - I'm a 23 year old Ph.D. student who won a prestigious fellowship, and it looks like this is causing the IRS to consider me a ""child.""",finance,1423883414

Countrywide sold it to Bank of America on 9/2011, and then it was immediately moved to Greentree, a subsidiary of BofA(?).  I noticed a little while later that the website was reporting the interest rate as 4.5%, although I'm not sure what they are calculating it as for the sake of interest accumulating.

I checked my closing paperwork for the mortgage and confirmed I was correct, and then I called and asked them what my interest rate was, and was told 4.5%.  I told them that was incorrect, and it was actually 4.375%.  I told them I confirmed it in my paperwork.  I was put on hold, and the guy came back on (around a ten minute hold) and he told me he double checked me loan documentation and it was indeed 4.5%, and I was mistaken.

I asked what I can do in this case, and he said I don't ""do"" anything because it was not an error, I was simply mistaken.  I asked him about the dispute process and he insisted I was making a mistake.  I didn't get an answer, and didn't push more.

As a 25 year old making 47k a year after taxes, I was thinking of starting a Roth IRA. I certainly will be at a higher tax bracket by the time I retire (or I hope to be!), and it seems as long as I am responsible with saving money and investing it into the IRA (I already do this for my savings, CDs, and mutual funds), it makes more sense. 

However, I'm a little confused on its benefits other than the ""no tax when you withdraw at 59 and 1/2"". 

While it can't immediately lower my tax bill, doesn't it hypothetically lower my taxes for next year, if I end up putting, say, $3,000 in it by tax time next year? Because that $3,000 will not be considered income... in other words, all other things being equal, my taxable income would drop by $3,000?

My plan was to max out the HELOC, getting rid of the big card and paying off a chunk of the other, while maintaining minimum payments on the HELOC, with the rest of the $500 going towards the rest of the remaining card's balance, which would be about $4,200. 

Is there something else I should be doing with the HELOC debt besides paying the minimum until the other debts are cleared?

personalfinance,Advice on mortgage down payment,"Hello everyone,

I am 23 and looking at buying my first home later this year.  I have about $20,000 saved up right now in a savings account and am hoping to get to about $25K/$30K by the time I'm ready to buy. 

I guess my question is this: I know I can get a better rate of return in the stock market, but is it worth the risk to put my down payment in the market for such a short term?  I hate leaving it in a savings account or putting it in a CD at such a low interest rate, but I know I'm going to need it in 6-9 months so the liquidity of a savings account is important.  I also know that the stock market comes with fees and capital gain taxes, and any short term investment in the market could be pretty risky. 

Any advice on what to do with this money?  Do I have any other options for a better short term gain?

personalfinance,"So Reddit, Did I Math?","Tax question time!

So, trying to figure out if I can max my 401k this year. When I ran this calculation at the end of last year (for this year), the answer was ""no"". Then recently, my girlfriend (now fiance) and I decided to get married later this year after some back and forth on dates and timing and all of that fun stuff. So today I went ahead and redid the calculations, and came to the conclusion that yes, I could (and fund a 2nd IRA partially as well). I would like a 2nd pair of eyes on the problem to see if I can math or not.

* Income and location

Me: $65,000 (ignoring bonus!) in NY, live in NJ

Fiance: $6500 in NJ (SSDI)

* Known Taxes and Deductions

HSA - $3350

IRA - $5500

FICA - $3822

NJ Tax Estimate - $100

Fed Married Filing Jointly - $12,600

2 Fed Personal Allowance - $8000

NY Married Filing Jointly - $ 15,850

2 NY Personal Allowance - $2000

* Federal Tax:

$71,500 - $3350 (HSA) - $5500 (IRA) - $20,600(Allowances) = $42,050 - [401k] = Fed taxable income

Fed Tax = $1845 (10% bracket) + (15%)($23600 - [401k])

* NY Tax:

$65,000 - $3350 - $5500 - $17850 = $38,300 - [401k] = NY taxable income

NY Tax = $678 (4% bracket) + (4.5%)($21350 - [401k])

* Bringing it all together to solve for [401k]:

$71,500 - Fed - NY - NJ - FICA - HSA - IRA - [401k] = Annual Spending = $35,000

$0 = 36,500 - Fed - NY - NJ - FICA - HSA - IRA - [401k]

$0 = $36,500 - Fed - NY - $100 - $3822 - $3350 - $5500 - [401k]

$0 = $23,728 - Fed - NY - [401k]

$0 = $23,728 - [$1845 + (0.15)($23,600 - [401k])] - [$678 + (0.045)($21,350 - [401k])]

$0 = $21,205 - (0.15)($23,600 - [401k]) - (0.045)($21,350 - [401k])

$0 = $21,205 - $4500 + 0.195[401k] - [401k]

$0 = $16,705 - 0.805[401k]

0.805[401k] = $16,705

[401k] = $20,750 which is greater than the $18,000 limit

$20,750 - $18,000 = $2,750 into a 2nd IRA.

People on here act like they aren't going to get social security (well founded fear i think) and that they are going to live forever.  I'm truly scared the way this country is headed SS is going to turn into a ""need"" based thing.  Just look at what is going on with health care.  Now our insurance is on the w2.  The Cadillac plans get taxed.  But they don't know what a Cadillac plan is yet.  Well now it is on the w2.

""The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Cadillac Tax will send $120 billion into the federal government's coffers from 2018 to 2024. About 25 percent of that is projected to come directly from employers, health-plan administrators and plan issuers.

But the remaining 75 percent, or $90 billion, is expected to come from higher taxable wages on workers. The CBO's projection is based on the assumption that many **employers will reduce health-care benefits to avoid the tax, and will boost wages to offset the effect on workers**. 

http://www.cnbc.com/id/102170937#.

LOL.  That will not happen.  Couple that with the fact all polls show everyone is fine reducing SS so long as it doesn't impact them and you can see what is on the horizon.

So who is going to be the ones targeted.  You damn well it is going to us.  The people that saved and planned.  We counted on getting something but I truly believe it isn't going to happen or it will be reduced.

Which brings me to my question.  When is enough enough?  I'm in my early 30's.  If I liquidated everything (Roths, 401k, etc) I could basically own everything I have in this world.  My rental would pay enough to cover its bills and my property taxes on my primary home with $300 left over each month. 

I just don't know anymore.  I thought about maybe a career switch but right now I'm not liking classes as much.  I'm also not sure I can pass.  I'm still working.  Doing ok so far but I'm questioning if it is worth the time and effort.  Spend most of today studying.  Going to be doing the same tomorrow.

I was taking nursing classes.  I loved everything about the preq. classes.  I thought I finally found something I would truly like doing.  I finally started my nursing classes and I was like WTF is this?  I am literally looking at questions and have the textbook open and I can't figure out the answer.  I am no longer enjoying school to the point I don't know if I should quit.  NCLEX style questions are the dumbest thing I think I have ever seen and I don't understand why they are trying to trick you.  I'm used to doing well in school and I have never experienced something like this.  I'm used to making things easier and streamlining them.  It is just something else.  It has been very unenjoyably so far.  I have about 1 more month to drop this semester without it staying on my transcripts.  I have another test coming up.  If I do poorly on that one it might clear some things up.  I've just never had something that I can study so long on it and feel like it is a crap shoot if I'm going to pick the right answer.  I have remembered what is in the book during the test and I can't figure out the question.

I've had a stable unstable job.  Basically lived in fear of being laid off so long I don't know much different.  That said I'm salary trapped.  If I lose my job my employment options in that field are limited.  Hence looking into the medical field.  I do at least have my CNA classes done so I probably could find work as a pat. care tech. or something if I had to do so.

So I'm left with 3 options.  I quit school and just ride out my job and if I'm laid off I'll deal with it then.  I don't really like the job but I do like the money which allows me travel.

2.  Is try and stick out school.  My concern with that is if I fail out it is on my transcripts.  This concerns me as I might have difficulty getting back in if I have a bad grade on my records.  That said I'm not really sure nursing is what I want to do anymore.  

Here is my other issue.  Everything is pushing for a BSN now.  I would only have an ADN.  A hospital near by has just implemented you have x amount of time to get a BSN or they will terminate you.  So I spend the next 2 years busting my ass to get a degree that I might not even use AND if I do end up using it I'm going to have to complete MORE schooling.  I have graduate level STATS classes that will not transfer because they aren't BIOSTATs.  Are you kidding me?  I have like 180 creds and only 6 transferred into my adn program.  So I spend more time, money, and energy in school and for what?  I don't know if it is worth it.

That also said I haven't really done much nursing as it has been pretty much all classes so far.  I hate quitting things.  Not sure if I'm scared of failure or not.  It is more the fear of failure and having the failure possibly close off a door that I might want to try and open again in the future. 

3. Is I hope my job holds for 5-10 more years and I jump the shark and just quit everything and see what happens.  I was thinking about maybe traveling for a while.  If 3 works out I'd probably have 200k-400k in the bank.  I could call it my pretirement.  I'd be in my 40's.  I think I travel the globe for a while on that money.  I'd still be young enough I could enjoy it.  I could deal with life again when I ran out of that money.  If I spent it all maybe I'd get some government money.  I'd be in the same boat as everyone else that didn't save which might be the winning move.

I could get the rental into an LLC. 

My wife works also and is much more stable income.  No kids but at this point in time she wants them I'd consider it.  She flips back and forth.  However, I will be the one quitting work and staying at home to raise the youngens.  She makes more than me anyways.

I'm sort of at a weird point in my life.

Thoughts?  Did anyone leave a high paying job to go flip burgers or something?  Were you happy with the results?  I like money as much as the next guy but at some point in time I'm going to treat my life like a math problem (yeah math!).  

When did you guys stop working?  When did you take a pay cut to just do something else?   Was it worth it?

I don't want to be the old guy I saw when I was traveling at the grand canyon that couldn't do much and had to sit down because of the heat.  I don't want to work my whole life to be to old to enjoy it in the end even if it meant having millions in the bank.  

I'm leaning towards quitting school or just staying with it and if I fail out I fail out.  That said my heart isn't really in it anymore.  Learning used to be fun to me.  This isn't very much fun what I'm doing now.",finance,1423961536

Hello all, and thank you in advance for your advice:
I have been delinquent on my car payment since August 2014. The loan (owned by Chase) was then transferred into the hands of Chase Recovery. The recovery team tells me that they want to either:

A) Receive my payment for the entire past due balance, and then set me up on a payment plan that is significantly more than my original payment in order to pay off the remainder of the loan. The new monthly payment amount they are asking for is 200% of the payments I was delinquent on. When I asked them if this agreement would guarantee that I not get repossessed, the representative told me something to the tune of ""I can't guarantee anything until you make the first payment, and we will see after that."" This option leads me to believe that they want to get as much money out of me as they can, and then repo the car anyways. Thoughts?

or B) They receive a payment from me for the full amount remaining on the loan. Then, of course, I would own the car outright and be safe from repossession. Unfortunately I cannot come up with this amount of money without asking a family member to take out a loan in their name, give me the full amount, I give it to Chase Recovery, and then I make the payments on their new loan.

Understandably, the family member does not like option B, and has asked a friend (who works in auto financing) for their input on my situation. The friend said that it is federal law that I can make up the past due balance in one payment and then have my regular loan payments continue at the original monthly amount. This is the solution that I presented to Chase Recovery (before hearing from the family friend), and Chase told me that catching up on the past due balance and then continuing on with my previous monthly payment is now impossible. Is Chase just playing hardball with me or is our family friend misinformed?

Either way, I would be extremely thankful to have your advice on this situation, how I should handle repayments, and how I can avoid losing my vehicle.

I already learned the first piece of advice the hard way: Make your car payment before anything else. Let this be a lesson to any youngsters like me that are about to jump into a car loan. It's better to be broke/hungry/bored for a week or two here and there than it is to start missing car payments.

I have two questions:

We have about $7500 in credit card debt that we've made no headway on in a year.  It's a Discover card with a 24.24% variable interest rate.
We have two new daughters in a nice daycare which eats up just about all of our income.

We don't have any really extravagant spending besides daycare which is about $23,000 a year total for both kids. We don't want to drop to a cheaper daycare.
So, to pay off 7500 with a high interest rate we're thinking of a few things.
#1.  transfer to another credit card with  0% interest on balance transfers for 18 months and pay it down.  I already looked at our existing other two credit cards which have 0 balance and they don't offer balance transfers so we'd have to sign up for a new one.
#2.  Get a personal loan from the bank or credit union.
#3.  Stop contributing to retirement accounts and put that towards credit cards.
#4.  We just got a $3700 tax refund. In the upcoming year we have AC repair, new car tires, dishwasher, and no emergency fund so I was thinking of using the refund for this.

We have a toddler, dogs, and I work from home which makes me concerned that if we try to show our home in its current state that our asking price will take a hit due to clutter. I also think there will be a lot of stress trying to show our house with all of the above factors. Plus, if we sell our house first that gives us a limited window to find a new one.

Ideally we would move first, slap a coat of paint on the walls of our current house and be able to show it as move-in-ready.

Here is our financial situation:

* Income: $6,500 take home/month (after funding retirement)
* House value: $230,000 according to Zillow
* Mortgage balance: $170,000
* Mortgage payment: $1,500 (incl. taxes &amp; insurance)
* Non-mortgage debt: 
    $325/mo on a 0% car loan (credit cards are payed off in full every month)
    $400/mo private student loans
* Savings: $60,000 cash (excluding a $10,000 emergency fund that I don't want to spend on this)

We are looking at homes around $350,000. My idea is to put $40,000 down on a new house from cash. That would put our loan-to-value (LTV) ratio around 88%. The remaining $20,000 would cover moving expenses, costs for our selling our current home, and mortgage payments for our current home.

Then, when we sell our current home - assuming we get the Zillow price and after realtor fees - we would get $46,000 which I would then put towards our new mortgage principle. That would lower the mortgage balance from $310,000 down to $264,000 and our LTV down to 75% so we could drop PMI at that point and potentially refinance or reamortize our loan to lower our payments (or not if the payments are manageable).

We don't really have any relatives that could loan us the equity until we sell our current house.

Here are the pros and cons I came up with for this plan:

**Pros**

* Don't have stress of showing home that we are living in
* Can make home more marketable and get higher price
* Less time pressure to find a house to buy (can walk away from negotiations)
* Instant gratification: we need a bigger house and the sooner the better

**Cons**

* Higher interest rate mortgage because we won't have 20% down
* Risk of not selling and having 2 mortgage payments (not concerned - houses in our area are selling well)

My question is, after all that, am I overlooking anything I should be considering?

personalfinance,Questions about PSLF and Consolidations,"I finished school in 2009. I have a several Stafford loans, a Graduate Plus loan, and 2 loans I consolidated early to lock in interest rates before Congress raised them. I recently started a new job working for a state government and want to take advantage of PSLF. My plan is to get qualified for PSLF and do income based repayment for the next 10 years. Given the time period that I took out these loan, I think I need to do a Direct Consolidation Loan to qualify. Is that correct?  ACS is my current servicer, and I wouldn't be sorry to no longer have to deal with it. Can I consolidate all my loans or just the Stafford loans? If I reconsolidate the already consolidated loans, will I lose out on the low interest rate (3.75%)?  If I get a consolidation loan now, will my current IBR plan be carried over or will I have to request it again?

personalfinance,Student Loan Interest Rate Issues,"I recently graduated from University with a bachelor's in physics. I got a pretty good job, luckily, and am making $65k/year. For the first couple of months, I put some money away and bought some essentials (bike for commuting mostly). Since then, I've been dumping at least $2k into my student loans every month.

When I went to school, I was an idiot. Nobody really told me that I should try to apply for scholarships or go to a cheaper school, so I didn't. I figured I wouldn't get any scholarships because my grades have always been good enough to get into school and get a job, but never really better than 'decent' - I ended up graduating with a 3.3 GPA. I ended up going to Penn State, and my parents were right at the income level where the government didn't really care whether or not I went into deep debt, and oh boy did I.

So I've got 4 loans out with Sallie Mae and their current balances are a bit distressing:

* Loan 1: $27,375.36 - 9.75%
* Loan 2: $19,468.33 - 8.63%
* Loan 3: $26,018.06 - 8.5%
* Loan 4: $23,607.20 - 8%

Finding those interest rates was hard because Sallie Mae recently completely nerfed their website whenever they split into Navient. I'm not sure what happened but it's very bare bones now and I can't do much besides make payments.

My question to all of you is just what can I do to make this easier? Would it be worth it to try to refinance them? I'm not really sure what that means. I think I used the debt reduction calculator a while back and it said I wouldn't get to finish paying all of this off for 5-6 years at $2k a month because those interest rates are truly suffocating. It's been maybe 5 months of doing the $2k payments and I don't think I've touched principal on the first loan yet (I'm paying the minimums on all three and dumping the rest on the biggest highest one).

First time posting here, please be kind. I have used the search function but cannot find a post related to my ask. If you know of no mother thread, please post the link.

I am looking for budgeting software, the two primary ones I see promoted here is mint and YNAB. I am looking for insights as to if these or possibly other would suit my needs.

About me.

I have a 9-5. I also have several real estate investments. My wife has a 9-5, and also a small business she is starting up. On top of this, i also have stock options within my company, amongst some other paper asset investments,

What I am looking for:


I am looking for software that can manage not only my primary household budget/expenses, but also that of my investment properties. I would also like to be able to include the financials from my wife's business. Additionally, I would love to find software that could track my stocks/stock prices, which varies and impacts my net worth. The ideal software would also calculate net worth, and be able to synchronize with  various financial institutions to pull down items such as mortgage and account information, track interest rates, etc. I am not as concerned with tracking everyday purchase to ensure I am inline with my budget, as I watch all my accounts daily and do an excellent job managing this as is.

Clearly this is a wish list and I would not expect any software to do all this, but if you know of anything that could check a large number of these off my list it would be appreciated. Currently I am tracking all via excel spreadsheets which is cumbersome and time consuming.

personalfinance,"Had to amend tax return having e-filing with H&amp;R Block. The federal amended return that H&amp;R Block generated is fine, but the state one is incorrect. What to do?","I e-filed through H&amp;R Block. My return was accepted and I've already received my refund. However, I discovered that I was eligible for some additional credits, so I started the process of amending my return with H&amp;R Block's software. 

Basically, I realized that I was eligible for tax credits that reduced my federal tax liability to zero. However, this increased my state tax liability (since I can no longer deduct my federal taxes paid) to the tune of $19. 

The problem is that, while the federal 1040X that H&amp;R Block generated for me seems perfect, the new state tax form is just plain old wrong. It doesn't fill in the correct information in the ""Amended Return"" section of the form. Instead, it acts like this is my first return, and so it's saying that I should get a refund of $308, when in fact, I now owe the state of Missouri $19. 

Not sure what I should do here...I guess just copy most of the information onto my own Missouri 1040 form and then correct it where necessary? There does not seem to be any sort of customer service or help number/chat/email/hotline for H&amp;R Block. I guess they don't want to pay for that for their free online filers.

personalfinance,Best way to protect assets from creditors after death?,"I really hope this doesn't fall under legal advice. But really I'm seeking *general information* on how people do this. 
Anyway, my Dad had a store that went out of business in 2009, left him with $250k in debt, also had a $300,000 motor boat repossessed about the same time. 
Left him with a boat load of unsecured debt. (see what i did there?) 
Anyways he's paying $700/month and he's 55. So they payoff date is... you guessed it: NEVER. He'll be in his early-mid 130's when this is paid off.

He's already considered and decided against: 

* bankruptcy - the business debt was federally guaranteed much like student loans, wouldn't have worked anyway.
* Obliterate the majority of his retirement savings and wipe the debt out tomorrow. 

Bottom line is that upon death, he's going to owe money to people. What kinds of things are there out there that protect assets at death? Just pull all your money out in cash and physically hand it to your heirs before you die? Or maybe just don't tell the creditors that he died and take all his money before they find out?  Best thing I can think of, that's why I'm here.

EDIT: btw, the state is California. 
EDIT: I don't see any moral issue in ""robbing"" creditors. Thats what would happen in bankruptcy anyway. The financial collapse was caused in part by people like my dad taking out shitty loans, but also by banks *giving out those loans*. Both parties are suffering heavy losses in this situation which they brought on themselves. 

EDIT: Came up with some else, by doing research online. A man who owed a lot of money, and his house was his only asset. Before his death, he sold his home to the company he owned. And leased it back to himself. the company made the mortgage payments. It went to court and the court decided.... drum roll.... creditors were out of luck. 
It was a blatant effort to shield assets from creditors, but the court decided no defrauding had occurred.",finance,1424021885

* Neither my wife nor I have purchased a house before
* My wife's mother has purchased 9 houses over the past 25 years and has generated a notable amount of wealth from these investments. She has never owned more than two at once, she typically buys a house, fixes it up over a few years, and then sells it
* Each of us has a steady income of between $100k and $125k

**Our Goals**  

* Purchase a home that we can turn into a duplex, or something that is already a duplex and fix it up.
* My wife and I will live in one section of the duplex. The other half of the duplex will be rented out. 
* My wife and I will most likely live there 2 to 3 years at the most with the intention of buying more property to rent/manage.
* Ideally we will not sell this property but continue to rent it out.

My wife and I could purchase a home on our own, however, by combining resources with my wife's mother it is expanding what options we have to purchase a home while minimizing the amount of capital we each need to invest.

I am not one of those, posting on advice for how to invest the 200K I have sitting in my lap. I am here to ask for assistance in planning out the money I can save in the next ten-twenty years. This is a post asking for longer-term advice

**My Goals:** I would like to retire before 40. I have a lot of things I want to do, and I can't do many of them with the commitment a job requires. Thus, I feel I need to plan ahead, and attempt this for my own well being.

Currently, my expenses are likely very low compared to most people. I came out of a job which was something akin to construction- which meant my pay jumped up and down between 10 hour weeks/months, to 70-80 hour weeks for entire months + the travel time in between. I've become very good at watching the dollar, and planning for the stretch I won't have any. Before I was making between 20-30K a year, with very poor benefits, and a job environment that seemed to burn out employees rather quickly.

It was pitiful, but I paid off my student loans with it (17K) and started my own investments- continuing a Roth IRA which was opened when I started working at fifteen, and leading to the first 3K needed to open a taxable Vanguard account.

Recently though- a few months ago, I landed an office job with a salary and 401k benefits with a 4% match. It is paying me 40K a year, and now that 2015 has come around, and I'm getting comfortable with it, I would like advice on how to proceed further.

Summary of expenses:

I spend in total- under 14K a year, which leaves 26K before taxes take a bite. My expenses have been greatly reduced now that I am not travelling as often, and may actually only be around 12K, but it's still too early in the year to know for certain.

I am maxing my 401k at this current moment- or close to maxing. I have 40% of my paychecks (bimonthly) go towards the 401k. When combined with the 4% match- this should lead to around 17,600 dollars a year to the 401k. Those contributions are split 50/50 between two Vanguard funds with low fees.

After Tax I get around 700 dollars flat (x2 for the month) but I expect to get a relatively healthy refund from the Fed this time next year as I am only making around 25K after my 401k contributions.

Current Assets:

* I now have 22,000 in my Roth IRA, and I plan to continue to max this. It is all under the [Star Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0056&amp;FundIntExt=INT) with Vanguard. 

* I have also put 8,000 away in a taxable account, in the [Total stock index](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&amp;FundIntExt=INT)

* A safety net of 4K in my checking/saving + 1K in cash to bring me to a 5 month net.

* I have a paid off vehicle, which probably has a value of 5K, but it is running fine. All other belongings combined would like equal 5K in total. Rough summary 10K in total physical value

* 401k: 4k or so at the current moment, in two accounts, one from this year- starting my benefits with the new job, and one from my previous job where I was auto enrolled for some percentage (I don't know what it was but it was low.)

* HSA: 250 dollars. Not proud, but there it is.

Any advice on how to proceed would be welcome. I plan on maxing the 401k for 12-13 years, to secure a reliable means of compounding interest in the absence of a steady job. I do not plan to touch this money for 35-40+ years

I personally believe that the Roth IRA is going to be the most crucial fund I possess, as I will be able to withdraw from this prior to the Government deemed retirement age of 59^1/2 / 65

Should I continue to place the extra few thousand a year I gain into the taxable Vanguard account? Is that a reasonable thing to do- or is there some other method which may be more profitable/less easily taxed?

**Edits from comments below: With my new understanding on how much I'm overpaying in taxes at the moment- I'm looking at around 8,000 dollars to invest 2015, 5,500 of which will go right into the Roth. That leaves 2,500 to go towards a taxable account, or my safety net. Hopefully raises over time will allow that number to jump up a bit in the future.**

personalfinance,Home purchase with wife's private student loan in default,"Looking for the best course of action in our situation. We are recently married and want to buy a house in the next 12 months. Before we got married, I knew she had financial problems and worked with her to pay off old credit cards and federal student loans. The only remaining debt is the big one. $28k in private student loans.
My wife did not finish her degree and these loans went into default in December, 2007 since she did not make a single payment on them.  According to the last credit report I pulled, this is scheduled to fall off her record this November. Would we be better off waiting until December to apply for mortgages, as this will no longer show up, or contact the loan company right away and negotiate a repayment plan?
We currently have $12k in savings.  The loan has $8k past due. When I check online, it is not accruing interest or fees, the overall balance is staying the same and the past due amount is just increasing by the monthly payment amount.

personalfinance,Question about (US) federal tax withholding and raises.,"I was wondering how withholding changes when you get a raise in the middle of the year.  For instance, at the beginning of the year, you are looking to make $60,000 AGI (for simplicity's sake your exemptions are factored in as they won't change over the course of the year) you'll pay an effective tax rate of 18.1% ((10% * 9,075 + 15% * 27,825 + 25% * 23,099)=10,856/60,000); therefore (and I may be wrong here) your employer is going to take 18.1% from every paycheck.

Now, if you get a raise in June to $70,000/year AGI, you are now anticipating to have $65,000 AGI in income this year (30,000 for the first 6 months and $35,000 for the second 6 months).  That means your new effective tax rate is 18.6% = (ditto + 25% * 28100)/65,000.  At this point does your employer take out 18.6%?  If so, you'd fall short in withholdings as you owe $12,106, but they withheld 18.1% * 30,000 + 18.6% * 35,000 = 11,940 right?  Therefore, do they withhold at 19.0743% to get the total withholding to $12,106?

Once the next year starts, you would see your withholding change to the estimated rate for 70,000 which would be 19.08%?  If I'm not mistaken, if your raise was large enough, you could actually see less money withheld come January 15 then December 14 though more than January 14.",finance,1424046436

investing,Lets talk about interest rates and treasuries,"I have been following interest rates in the US closely for the past year or so.

personalfinance,How to manage student loan repayment and build an emergency stash of cash?,"Hello everyone,

I have what I guess is a slightly unique situation. First, the basics. I've been working full-time for about 6 months as an accountant and make $60K/year. Currently, between sallie mae (navient) and the government, I have to pay back about $1500 in student loans per month.

Currently I'm living rent-free with my mom, but those days appear to be numbered. Without getting into too much detail, I really dislike living with her. I know that financially, I should be trying to live at home as long as possible, but, for very very strong personal reasons, I want to be able to leave ASAP. The only issue is, my monthly student loan payments are so high, as well as buying food/gas/miscellaneous other expenses, PLUS I have about $8k in credit card debt (not from me buying dumb shit, from education expenses my last year of college. Used to be $13k in credit card debt) still that I can't seem to get ahead on too quickly that I can't afford to even have a roommate. The Sallie Mae loans are set for me to pay off in 5 years, and I would like to extend that time frame in order to lower my monthly payment, but I know with private loans they're unwilling to help you out in most scenarios -- especially if your job is providing the means to make the payments.

Now for the really dumb strategy I'm toying with. I've been thinking of taking out a personal loan for $25,000, using that to get ahead on my student loan payments so I don't have to pay anything for that for at least a year, and then finally getting rid of my credit card debt/building a cash reserve. I know the interest rate on the personal loan will be higher than my student loans (student loans prob. average 10% interest right now), so I'm aware that it's not a good tradeoff, but my job is pretty steady and I'll probably get a lot of money back in my tax return to pay off most of the credit card debt...but do you guys think there is another option for this?

Also, I was considering getting a used car that I could Uber with to earn some extra cash on nights and weekends, but I'm still looking into how profitable I can expect to be driving Uber.

About to sell house and use VA loan on another 0 down house but around 100k more, while trying to retain as much in pocket and pay bills off.
&amp;nbsp;

100% VA combat disabled+SSDI, the one not based on financial need, but disability
No ""earned"" income.
Wife goes to school and cares for the house and myself, she also receives tax free VA comp for caring for me.

&amp;nbsp;

Casual trading is an option for me as I would only pay 10% capital gains on short term stuff due to my 0 earned income and 0% on anything over a year.  I've had success using those $7 per transaction fee sites.  

$18k with a $9k investment over 9 months and made out like a bandit, I couldn't believe that was possible, I felt like I had done something wrong and went to the lawyer then IRS and everything was okay.  I just paid the 10% short term gain tax and all was good.  This was when I was right out of the military and dabbled in it as a hobby.

&amp;nbsp;

So here is the meat:

No roth nothing I can contribute to because of my 0 earned income.

Me:
$3,172 VA Comp

$847.00  SSDI after medicisomething

$73  Department of Defense combat retirement pay

SO:
$1,370 VA comp for caregiver stipend

***Total: $5,462 a month tax free***

&amp;nbsp;

We don't have to report those incomes to IRS because they are combat related.  We only pay taxes on any capital gains.  I go every year to the IRS office to make sure everything is okay and after we end up going through everything they say I don't have to report the combat income and usually because my capital gains are so small or none past few years, I haven't had to legally file those years as well.  I'm also in the lowest tax bracket you can imagine due to basically 0 earned income, like Warren Buffet.

&amp;nbsp;

***Expenses:***

Bought brand new house in 2011 for $208k OTD and 0 down

House worth 270k minimum, I always plan for the worst.

Owe $195k @ 4.875% $122/mo HOA

$1,380 a month payment that's principle, interest, tax and insurance, no 

PMI due to VA loan.

4 years in so no tax if I sell due to primary residency.

&amp;nbsp;

New 2012 car worth $12k, $340/mo payment, owe $9,500 @3.9%

&amp;nbsp;

3 Credit cards:
10k limit with 9k @12.99% on there, currently been using it the past few months as I used cash to pay off another car I had, which I now gifted my sister. She helped put up funds for our wedding in exchange for that car, which is paid off just now and i'm signing her the title once it comes in.  So no more extra $300 a month.

Another 1k limit card with 600 on it.
Last credit card is my SO's and has a very low limit, I think it's a store credit card.

SO's student loan is $10k, she pays $100 a month.  I have no clue what her interest rate is

&amp;nbsp;

$800 in utilities, cell, internet, car insurance. I have solar panels so I spend more on the cell and internet side.

about $400 a month in food or less, this is being very liberal.

$400/ mo in entertainment and clothing, etc.  This is based on my average over the years once again being liberal.  I also get a clothing allowance once a year of $750-800, but let's not count that, I ruin clothes due to prosthetic.

Gas maybe $50-100/ a month if that.  We don't have commutes, and only groceries, visiting family and friends or going out..  Also 4 cylinder, Dual Clutch, Direct injected, 29city 40 hwy mpg!  I average 34mpg, she averages 30mpg.

&amp;nbsp;

***Total expenses are $3,642 a month*** and another $300 in credit card payments

&amp;nbsp;

***$5,462 comes in and $3,642 goes out***

***And $1,820*** left over, what to do with now that I've gotten that vehicle paid off and I'm about to sell my home and get another.

&amp;nbsp;

The house sale will probably leave me with $50k or more after real estate fees and any closing costs, repairs and things I need to do right now, like backyard, etc.

The house we want is around $300k no HOA, more land and is brand new as well.  No HOA is $122 more a month I can put toward my mortgage or pocket.  Also lower interest rate than mine, which I'm currently seeing 3.8-4% for VA style loans is going to save me another $100 a month.

So mortgage, taxes and insurance may go up $400, but offset that by another $200-300 i'm saving from my current houses HOA and extra interest.

&amp;nbsp;

So, anyone have any ideas?  Also will be buying a car after the sale.  Actually probably a beater pickup truck for home depot runs for around $3k, don't worry i'll be saving that and pay cash.

So what do i do with at least another $50k and extra $1,820?

Should I pay off my credit card and SO's student loan?  Maybe even the car?

I'm still going to keep the 10k limit on the credit card.  I usually use the credit card as all my purchases and leave my debit at home.  It's just safer, not my money per say, so I wouldn't be left without my real money.

I then usually make one huge payment at the end of the month and it keeps my debit bank account nice and clutter free and my real money safe at home in a safe.  

But the quick paydown of that car hurt me the past 8 months living on credit using my cash toward the priciple, and now I feel so free without that car.  So now I have to work on getting back on track, help a young lad out!

I was also thinking about closing my SO's credit card as it's literally junk, $300 credit limit, and adding her onto one of mine once I pay them down to my regular usage which never goes above 20% usually.

&amp;nbsp;

And I basically bank and insure through USAA and Navy Federal.  Also will open up an Ally bank account once I get paid in a few days to at least start an emergency fund.  6 months right?  So that's 6 x $3,642?  So I need a $22k nest egg in Savings as my quick, go to emergency fund.

Oh also I have one CD with Navy Federal at 5% APY.  But it maxes at ~~$2,500~~$5,000.  Right now it's only $100.  And will also add to it this next paycheck after emergency fund gets settled a bit.

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR:**  $5,462 tax free coming in, $3,642 expenses.  $1,820 savings per month.  Sell home gain another $50k+ cash.  Can't get a roth IRA or any retirement account.  Where do I find a replacement for long term retirement?",finance,1424090892

I am trying to figure out if I should pay off our bills for the next few months, pay off a credit card or two, or put it into our mortgage. 

Currently our bills look like this:

$1040 Mortgage Payment a month [Currently a $260 automatic withdrawal from our checking every week on payday]

$726 for utilities and other monthly bills

$860 in groceries, formula, diapers, gas [Working on getting this lowered]

$17641 on our car [we just purchased it] [EDIT: Interest rate is 8%]
$6265 on our Chase card [EDIT: Interest rate is 13.24%]
$586 on our Capitol one card[EDIT: Interest rate is 0% for the next 10 months]

So do we pay off our bills for the next few months, and use our paychecks to pay down debt?
Or pay off a credit card?
Or put it into our mortgage?

Thanks in advance for any help!

Edit: I have included our interest rates above. Also we have no savings, we have been doing paycheck to paycheck since November.

--------------------------------------------------

Edit#2: Thank you for all the great answers! I just spoke with my husband and this is what we have decided:

1] Pay half of our Capitol One card since its 0% interest and it will lower the payments on it
2] Put the rest on the Chase card to kill that debt. This will again lower the payments.
3] Once that helps boost our credit score, we will refinance the car loan. Thus lowering the payments.
4] Take the excess money we have from lower payments and put it straight into savings every month to build a cushion, it will start small, but that works for us. And worse comes to worse, we have the Chase card to fall back on.
5] As far as withholdings go, it will be a lot different this year, all of our life events happened in the last 3rd of the year, so for 2/3rds of the year we were childless, single individuals just renting, which is a factor in our refund being so high.
6] Our car is under a great warranty, so I am not worried about repairs. My husband and I work in the same building so some days we can cut down on gas by commuting together if our schedules allow it. I downloaded YNAB the other day to start budgeting better, rather than a simple spreadsheet.

personalfinance,Thinking about purchasing a home. Would like your opinion on the numbers.,"This is on a throwaway since my friends/coworkers know my main and I'm not 100% comfortable with them knowing all my financial details.  Thanks beforehand.

We're looking at a 700k home in a high COL area.  We'd put a little over 10% down to lower the mortgage to 625k so we could qualify for a conventional loan.

A few of our details:

* Combined income of 240k (I'm 31 and she's 29)
* Retirement accounts at 280k.
* 30k in school debt which is at a really low interest rate so we haven't really prioritized it.
* 7k in car debt at 0%.
* Roughly 85k in cash.
* 150k in rental property mortgages  (2 properties) that earn $2,700/mo and cost about $1,500 / mo for mortgage, taxes, insurance.

Both jobs are pretty stable. We're also both on track to move up in our respective companies.  We currently rent a small home in the area for $2,500 / mo. On top of rent we're saving roughly 4k a month.

I estimate that mortgage, taxes and insurance will run about $4,200 per month. But with fed (28%) and state (8%) taxes i hope to get back about 35% so that would lower the payment to lets say $3,000 per month.  Since we're currently saving plenty for retirement and already throw $2500 to our rental I think the numbers check out. But i'd like a second opinion.  Reddit, what are your thoughts?

If an individual is a member of an LLC with pass-through tax treatment but the members of that LLC are not paying that individual a distribution while retaining one for themselves under false pretenses ( the operating agreement stipulates distributions must be made to all members in proportion to their interests), does that individual have recourse, i.e., is there a way to report the LLC, or avoid or delay paying taxes?

Even if claims are being litigated, is there something to do in the interim period?

personalfinance,Any online software for two tax returns for single state?,"So I'm in interesting tax situation. Saw nothing in the FAQ/wiki. Saw nothing with a google search. TL;DR: I need to file two returns for Maryland as a nonresident and resident as well as a part-year nonresident for Delaware. Can any online tax software do this?

Ok, now for the long story (sorry for wall of text, giving as much detail as possible while being a throwaway):

I finished up my degree last year in Delaware and got a job in Maryland. These states do not have a reciprocity agreement of course. The job was close enough that I could commute (~45 min) but wanted to be closer as I could save on gas (as well as my gf having more opportunities for jobs). Before I started, we found a place and moved **one week** after I started working. At the time, I think nothing of the tax implications of doing this.

Flash forward to a few weeks ago when I get all of the relevant paperwork. I plug everything into TurboTax, out pops my refund. I always like to check with another website to make sure I didn't miss anything, and I turned to TaxAct. Everything proceeds as normal until I got the the state return section and I see a warning (paraphrasing) ""if you moved into or out of Maryland and received income as a resident and nonresident, you must file two returns and TaxAct **cannot** do this"". I go the Maryland tax website and the [Nonresident taxpayer guide (PDF, page 4 bottom left)](http://forms.marylandtaxes.com/current_forms/nonresident_booklet.pdf), and sure enough, legally speaking, I have to file two Maryland returns (in addition to Delaware).

Armed with this new information, I go back to TurboTax, can't file two single state returns. I can't do it in TaxAct like I mentioned before. I go, to hell with it, fill out everything by hand, and get my numbers for each form following the instructions (I got the same number for Federal as with the software so I'm 99.94% sure I'm doing it right). I try H&amp;R Block and FreeTaxUSA and neither can do multiple returns for a single state. The official [Maryland website](https://interactive.marylandtaxes.com/individuals/iFile_ChooseForm/), from as far as I can tell, will only let me do one return as well.

So is there any tax return software that can do multiple returns for a single state, or do I bite the bullet and send it in by postal mail/drop it into a tax center?

I can also lie and say I moved before I started working, but that's not advantageous for me as well as illegal. For numbers:  

Correct Way | Return Amount | Lying Way | Return Amount
---|---|---|---
Maryland, Resident | $284 | Maryland | $302
Maryland, Nonresident | $37 | Delaware | -$12
Delaware | $14 | | 
**Total** | **$335** | **Total** | **$290**

financialindependence,How significant is the mortgage interest tax break?,"I am curious about how much of an impact the mortgage interest tax break has and if there is a way to use it to calculate an optimal amount of interest to pay for a house. I'm not sure if I'm thinking about it in the right way, but is there ever a case where buying more house or getting a longer term loan is more financially advantageous? 

My first instinct is no, but I can't completely wrap my head around why. If I have a loan at 4% interest, but that interest is deductible from a 33% marginal tax rate, and you are already contributing max to pre-tax retirement accounts to lower AGI, is there any point where paying more interest is good? Or is there an easy way to calculate an adjusted interest rate like the 4% above is more like 2.5% interest because of the portion of income taxes that is written off (like an APR that incorporates how much you save in taxes)?

personalfinance,How much to put into a supplemental 401k when I also have a Pension Plan.,"Hello PF.  You guys have been a big help in setting up a budget and paying down some debt.  Now I'm ready to fix my retirement accounts.

I'm 31 and my wife (29) and I have zero saved for retirement because we've always been paying off debt of some kind.

I just started a new job (about $65k a year) that has a pension plan that I pay 7% in to.  I also have an option of a 401k but there is no match because they put money into my pension plan.  I'll only get 2/3's or so of my pay when I retire which is nice but it makes it hard to figure out how much total I need to save.  I looked at the FAQ and tried to find some online calculators but I'm having trouble trying to figure out how much I should be putting into my 401k in order to catch up.  I thought I'd put in 5% but I wanted to get some opinions.  I know I need to catch up big time but I need to be realistic about what I can afford.

My wife is working for herself and we're looking into opening an IRA for her but we have 1 high interest loan left that we may pay down first (not including a car, school loans, and a mortgage that all have decently low interest rates).

My wife will go back to a regular full time job in a few years and will be able to start a 401k or something similar but right now we basically live off my salary so when I'm planning for retirement I'm not sure if I should be saving more to account for both of us.

personalfinance,Please help: considering selling some mutual fund to support tuition and want to ensure I properly understand cap gains tax liability. Thank you!,"Long time reader, first time poster. I will lay out my situation and then ask questions below.

Here's the deal. I am 29, a graduate student in the medical field (physician assistant), so far funding my education on Stafford unsubsidized loans and my own savings. I have not had to take the higher-interest GradPLUS loans just yet, something I am trying to avoid. 

To keep loan debt and accumulated interest low, I am considering selling about 10K worth of a Vanguard mutual fund that I have. This would fund my summer semester 2015 in lieu of a GradPLUS loan, which I would require because I have already exhausted my Stafford loan limit of $20,500 for the 2014-2015 year. I am hoping to take advantage of the fact that I have no income in order to allow me to pay little, if any, capital gains taxes. 

Before I do this, I want to ensure that I understand the tax implications. Please see image below of this fund in my account:

[Wellington Fund holding](http://i.imgur.com/vgH2EK4.jpg?1)

The current price of this fund is $39.75. My understanding is that I would be selling noncovered shares first. Cost basis for noncovered shares is $29.81

$10,000 / 39.75 = 251.57 shares redeemed

$29.81 x 251.57 shares = $7,499.37 tax cost on shares sold

$10,000 - $7,499.37 = $2500.63 capital gain

HOWEVER... I am a student for the 2014 and 2015 tax years, making zero income except for borrowing federal loans. Because this places me in the lowest federal bracket, am I correct in reasoning that I will essentially pay zero tax on this sale? If so, here are some follow up questions:

1) Is this a foolish move compared to just taking out a loan? I do consider this fund to be my emergency fund, but I feel that borrowing a little wouldn't wipe me out. For comparison, a GradPLUS loan is 7.21% + 4.292% fee. 

2) Would I be liable for any other taxes associated with this sale?

personalfinance,"Family member offered to ""help"" with mortgage, but charging high rates","I just need someone to give me some opinions. I have tried talking to family about this but they all get upset and it's impossible to have an unbiased opinion.

Here's the deal:
A year ago my grandmother pulled me aside and told me that she wants to help me purchase a house, by providing the loan. At that time I was a student at university and we discussed waiting until I was ready. In August she brought it up again and I was told that the mortgage would be my inheritance after they passed away, and in the mean time I would pay it like a normal borrower. Great, this was the agreement, no terms discussed.

In October of last year I decided I was ready as I had a good job and want to move. They told me to go ahead on a bid for $185,000 cash on a house I was interested in and I would pay the equivalent of 5% mortgage rates + $200 to cover taxes. Fine. The offer was declined and I decided I didn't want anything else and would wait a few months. This was fine with them as they hadn't actually sold investments to gather the cash.

Now it's february and I found another house. They said go ahead, this time with a max of $180,000 and a payment that equates to a 6% APR. Of course they didn't say this outright, just told me the payment amount.  When I questioned it, because of course going rates are sub 4%, I was told it would cost them money to sell investments and besides they'd only live 10-15 years MAX anyway so essentially take it or leave it.

Honestly, my feelings are hurt. I think that's the major issue here. My own grandparents are charging me 50% more than a bank would, because they're going to die soon? I feel like just telling them to forget the whole thing and going to the bank. His justification of avoiding a credit check (I have great credit), and loan initiation fees don't justify the extra $200/mo for the next 10-30 years. I really don't want to sit around hoping my grandmother dies so I can save a little money.

My wife is set on getting the house, I was going to make an offer tomorrow and they sprang this on me. I just bought a new car in October and co-signed on another a week ago because I didn't think I'd need to be careful about my utilization since the loan was private. Now I may have to go to a bank and that will cause issues.

personalfinance,"24/m, $100K+ in debts, some in my parents bankruptcy...what to do?","I know there's a lot of posts on this sub about student loan debt but mine's a little different due to my parents bankruptcy situation. 

I have 3 private student loans I cosigned with my parents to different companies during my education. They ""took them out"" (whatever that means) of the bankruptcy, but according to the companies, they're in bankruptcy status, so they won't bill me for them or really allow me to get any information. Honestly, I'm not even sure what company owns one of them anymore, and only one of the other two will even give me any information on the loan at all, but they show up on my credit report. The good news is that this isn't hurting my credit, but I have a feeling it will the day they get out of the bankruptcy.


On the other hand though, the loans may just disappear as part of the bankruptcy but I know I shouldn't bank on that. It's my debt, and I should pay it, I'm just not even sure how at this point. One of the companies will let me mail in payments, but it making it difficult to do so and the other won't even talk to me about them. So there they sit...collecting interest...


Here's a summary of my debts:


- $35,000-ish in Stafford loans I'm paying on (6.5% interest rate)
- $21,000 at this point on one private loan at 4.5% interest


- $16,000 or so in another loan, know which company, they won't talk to me


- $15,000-20,000 in another loan that's been sold so many times I don't know which company I owe it to, last I checked it was Citibank. It could also have been forgiven, a lot of my parents debts were just given up right when they filed for bankruptcy


I also have $10,000 left in a car payment to a car really worth $4500 at this point (I was a young fool buying it). This is at 3.25% and isn't too bad but if I didn't have those debts, I'd probably be pushing money into paying this off. And then I've got about $1000 in zero interest credit cards I could pay off at any point.


My bank account sits at about $5,000 right now, I'm making $75k at my current job but starting a new one in 2 weeks where I'll be making $100k. So paying on stuff isn't really a crunch on me, I just would rather figure out how to get some of this debt gone. I don't really understand how this bankruptcy stuff works or how to find these loans. Any advice? One thing I'm wondering is if there's a way to get a consolidation loan for these private loans so I can actually pay on them and maybe at a lower interest rate. 




Edit: I ran a new credit report and it looks like only two  of the private loans are listed now: a $11,000 one to Navient and a $21,000 one to AES.

My former company gave me 10k as a sign-on bonus when I joined in 2013, but I actually received only 6k since 4k was taxed (for the purpose of this question, assume the 4k is all federal tax).  In 2014, I quit the company before the agreed date so I had to return all 10k of my sign-on bonus with the 4k tax.

Questions:

* Which box on the 1040 should I put the 4k to get that tax back?
* The 6k I returned to my company is technically 6k less on my income this year. Can this be reflected anywhere on my 1040 (or another tax form)?
* I guess I'll have to attach to 1040 a copy of my receipt of repayment. Is there anything else I should attach/write?

Instead, the employee is entitled to a deduction (or credit in some cases) for the repaid wages on his or her income tax return for the year of repayment.

I got my first personal loan so I could move, then I refinanced so I could move and replace a broken laptop, then buy a car. Then my bank stopped allowing me to refinance because my account had been in negative within 6 months. Which is fair, I needed to better manage my bills. 

Then I had an emergency and had to get another loan with another bank to get out of a bind. And I picked fixed rate when interest rates were high because I didn't want them to get any higher. How was I supposed to know they were coming down? I know...I'm an idiot. 

I also have a credit card with $2000 of debt on it. I no longer use it and I reject all offers of increasing the credit limit because I realise that would just be digging a bigger hole. 

First loan has $6000 left on it, but the interest rate is 16.22% and fees are massive. I pay $348.00 p/month off that loan and then the interest and fees get added. Which is about $200.00. 

Second loan is $410.00 per month as I wanted to get it paid off in a year. 

Credit Card $2000.00, I am only making minimum payments as that is all I can afford right now.

In 2014 I paid zero income tax because I live in a state with no income tax, and the paltry amount of federal tax was all refunded through the Lifelong Learning Credit.  Because I knew my tax rate would be nil, I put $1500 into a Roth IRA and did not deposit into my (non-matched) 403b at all.  I also made about $6000 of student loan payments with interest rate 2.75%.

For some further background info, I have $92k student loans remaining, and my fiancee will have ~$140k when she graduates school in June.  Her loans are 5.4-6.8%.  She'll qualify for the Lifetime Learning Credit next year which reduces our tax burden significantly.

Our student loans are both from med school, so the figure is large in comparison to our current income, but we can count on a big income increase after 3-5 years of residency.

personalfinance,"My City is becoming one of those ""hot places to live"", buy a house now?","I live in minneapolis MN, and is consistently attracting more and more young professionals over the years. There are articles about it is basically the sweet spot of affordability and new job growth. I have noticed rent prices increasing every year, and housing prices going up as well. 

I want to buy a house in 3-4 years. Not now. I don't want to deal with the maintenance etc and have no need for all the space. But I eventually will. Reasons: I am busy with grad school AND work. I  don't have a 20% downpayment. I want to do 20% downpayment and 15 year mortgage. Buy mostly  - I'm just too damn busy with other things. 

Problem is, do I have to worry about housing prices skyrocketing in the next 3-4 years due to this boom? 

Is the house that I want now at 200,000 going to be 300,000 in 3-4 years? 

Do I do a 10% downpayment now, get the house, squeeze my paychecks, have little time for maintenance and upkeeping or wait 3-4 years and pay 100,000 more for the house. 

This ""citywide boom"" is really pissing me and interrupting my plans to buy a house when i want buy it.

personalfinance,How to pay off my loans,"Hi PF, 

I'd like some tips on how to pay off my student loans each month. I'm currently living at home and make $2,500 a month. Realistically, I can afford $1,000 a month towards my loans, but that gets tight. Currently I'm saving $750 a month. $250 goes to a Roth, $500 to savings. The remaining $750 goes to monthly bills, car insurance, fuel, and my social life. I have a few quick questions on exactly how to pay of my student loan debt. 

The back story: I have about $92k in student loan debt. 29K is in federal loans under my name with my parents as cosigners, and 63K is a private loan from MEFA, under my name with my parent's as cosigners. I'm fortunate enough that my parent's have agreed to pay half of the monthly payments. So, around $684 is auto-debited from my mother's checking account each month for the private loan. She said she is fine paying this for now, and I pay the federal loan for now, but I want to help more. 

My initial federal loan payment was something like $329 per month. I started paying $500 a month towards it for the past three months, but because I was paying more than I owed, one month my total due was 0 dollars. I paid $100 instead, and now my current amount due is $215. 

I want a better system to keep track of this. The federal loan amounts are 4-5 percent. Is it worth paying these off at such an advanced rate, or should I pay the minimum and put the rest in savings? Now, the private loan interest rate is much higher. The 63K is broken down into smaller loans, ranging from 7-9 percent. I'd like to help my mother with these loans. Would you all suggest linking my checking account to MEFA, and between my mother and I have two payments per month?

I would like to pay these loans down as quickly as I can while living at home. My parents have agreed to pay half of the loans, while I feel I should pay my half and then some, so we can pay them off as quickly as possible. As I said above, I can afford around $1k a month in payments, although some months that may be tighter than others. Somewhere around $850 may work best.",finance,1424191167

personalfinance,Question about tax returns from previous years (2012 &amp; 2013),"To put it bluntly, I have been negligent about my tax returns for the previous two years; 2012 and 2013. While I filed them electronically on H&amp;R Block, I never followed up and actually received the money I am owed. In 2012, I lived in CT and worked in NYC, after I filed NY owed me $12, CT owed me $45, and was owed $1056 on my federal return. I wanted that money to be direct deposited into my bank account, but it never was. At the time that cash wasn't super important to me so I let it go.

Last year when I filed, I worked in CT for most of the year, and only in NYC for a few months and the finances broke down as follows: I owed NY $12, CT owed me $615, and I was owed $1895 on my federal return. Now this time I chose to have the checks mailed to my home address in CT instead of a direct deposit....and I only ever received the CT check for $615. I never saw the federal check come through.

That's all background information. My question is...I'm trying to play catch up and track down these missing payments this year, and also to ENSURE that when I file this year, the same thing doesn't happen. I've tried using this site to track the status of a return, but it isn't finding anything: https://sa.www4.irs.gov/irfof/lang/en/irfofgetstatus.jsp

I haven't found any clear answers online, and I would really love to speak with someone about this issue. However when I call, it's impossible to speak to someone as everything is automated, and the official IRS number just kicks me off because it's the busy season. Any advice on what I should do going forward? Thank you!",finance,1424194030

personalfinance,"Best way (loan/credit, personal/business) to get a little bit on financing to start a small business? From a total finance n00b.","I've never had a loan. I had a $500 credit card in college that I paid off. I have absolutely no idea what my credit is, as I personally believe that if I want something, I should save and buy it outright rather than go into debt, if it can be avoided. And to make matters worse I've lived abroad for the past couple years and so have no tax info to show the bank. I will not be filing taxes this year.

I had an excellent opportunity to start a small business fall into my lap. Not to bore you with the details, but I've been working professionally with horses for the past 15 years, all over the world (I'm in the States now, a citizen), and have the opportunity to lease a gorgeous, large horse stables. Not only do I have a lot of experience, but I've run the numbers and I feel it's very likely to do well; the rent is $800 a month, there are 15 stalls, and each stall would bring in $400 a month. I'm familiar with the property and know I'm not accidentally renting a shithole. I would also have to buy things like hay, grain, electric (it's on well water, which is a huge plus when you're dealing with animals that drink gallons of water every day), pay a landscaping company (the horses will mow most of the grass though), things like that. 

I need about $3500 to start it, this includes fixing some things in the barn, fences, arenas, etc (about $1 - 1.5k), but for the most part the place is good to go. I'll also need to buy hay and grain, and be able to do so until I have enough boarders to cover the costs. I need an advertising budget, and minimal personal expenses of course. 

Any advice on what would be my best bet for getting $3500 from a financial institution? I don't want to take out a Small Business Loan, as while the rates are low the minimum amount is $10,000 (don't want to be that far in debt) and I don't want to wait weeks to get approved (I have people who want to start boarding in March, which also means I'll be getting in some money then). I'll also need access to cash, as the horse industry is largely cash-based (if I go to on old farmer to buy some hay, he's definitely not going to have a credit card reader and may not take a personal check). Obviously I don't want to get reamed with interest rates, but not knowing what my credit is and not wanting to do a business loan I'm not sure if that's avoidable.

* I'm 22 and just recently started my first job out of college. 
* I'm an Aerospace Engineer and make around $62k a year. Annual raises are ~3% and my manager said I'll be bumped up a pay grade next summer (so up to ~$76k). My job security is very good.
* I have $7k in a checking account and $28k left in student loans to pay off. 
* From what I net each month, I save $1k of it a month and throw the rest at the principal of my student loan.
* Grew up in a middle class family. My parents always made me feel really guilty whenever the topic of money came up, so I grew up with sorta an aversion to spending money. I guess you could say I'm frugal.
* I'm gay and am not expecting to raise kids or buy a house in the foreseeable future. 

Okay, so the reason I'm asking about savings accounts is that I always read posts on this subreddit where people talk about their savings accounts. Usually people say they use it for an emergency fund, saving for a house down payment, or saving for expenses for kids/family. Since I'll never be having kids and am not expecting to ever buy a house, is a savings account even worth it for me? Couldn't I just keep all of my money in a checking account? The interest rates seem laughably low and I can't justify opening one. I make more money from redeeming cash back rewards I get for using my credit card. I've also seen the argument that I might be tempted to spend the large balance in my checking account. I'm not an impulsive buyer so this is not the case for me.

The other parent is not in the picture and my own parents have never claimed my child nor do they have access to any of his info.**


Sorry for the long post guys, my head is still spinning...

So I filed taxes for the first time in two years today (previously unemployed) and went to H&amp;R block at the recommendation of a family member. I'm self-employed so the tax preparer did what seemed to be a fairly straight forward Schedule C. My federal refund came out to $1001 and I owed $353 in state taxes, so I was coming out better than I had anticipated. Then, as we were wrapping up, I was told that my H&amp;R Block fees were $567.95 - yikes! Still, I was coming out a little ahead and took that as a hard lesson learned that I should be better prepared to do my own taxes next year or at least take advantage of other resources that wouldn't take such a huge chunk of my return.

A couple of hours later I get a phone call from H&amp;R Block to inform me that my refund was rejected because someone else has already claimed my son for the EIC/Child credit. The lady who had prepared my taxes told me that I needed to bring in some documentation proving I was the sole caretaker of my son (she suggested social security card and daycare statements) and she'd give me a letter to send to the IRS along with them. She warned me that my refund would take a ""very long time"" to come through and that I needed to go ahead and bring her fee this week when I come from the letter. 

Right now I'm panicking and don't even know where to start.. I'm just getting back on my feet and as the sole provider of my kid I don't really have a spare $600 laying around. I guess I have three questions:

**Is there anyway to get out of paying the H&amp;R Block fee at this point?** I'm thinking the answer is no. I'm going through the paperwork and looking to see if I've signed anything stating that I owe them even if my refund is rejected. I haven't seen anything stating that yet, but I'm sure there's something along those lines in the fine print. Do I have any options other than trying to negotiate for a reduced fee?

**What do I need to prove that I'm the sole provider for my son?** Any specific documents that would be of help? Is there anything I can do to speed up this process? Can I keep this from happening again? I'm really curious about how my son's information was found in the first place... his father has never been in the picture and has no knowledge or access to any of our personal info.

**How worried to I need to be about my son's financial identity being used in other fraudulent ways?** As soon as I post this I'm going to pull his credit reports and look for anything suspicious (he's four, so they should be totally blank right?) and I'm considering putting a freeze on them. Are there any other steps I should take to protect his identity?

**tl;dr Someone has claimed my son as a dependent on their taxes so H&amp;R Block is asking for their filing fees upfront - which I don't have. How do I prove that my son is my dependent, protect his identity and wiggle my way out of the outrageous fees H&amp;R Block wants?**",finance,1424217931

**VIEWPOINT:**

* South Australia considers nuclear industry potential

Is South Australia's plan to set up a royal commission into the potential for nuclear power a local or national story, writes Ian Hore-Lacy.

The question of nuclear power for Australia has been raised several times over the last 60 years, but usually on the conservative side of politics. Apart from anything else, there has not been a strong need - the country has abundant coal located close to main population centres, and in using this for more than 80% of the electricity, has enjoyed some of the world's lowest power prices. But climate change concerns have changed the outlook nationally, and South Australia has always been less well-off than the eastern states in electricity options. Half its 5.3 GWe capacity is gas-fired, and its average wholesale power prices are one third greater than in the eastern states. Grid connections eastward amount to only 680 MWe.

Now a left-of-centre Labor government in South Australia is setting up a royal commission into the potential for nuclear power in that state, which already produces two thirds of Australia's uranium - all for export.

personalfinance,How can I prove to the IRS that I'm not a lying scumbag?,"I've never been very good with money until the past year. I've always filed my taxes through turbotax, I always file what I made that year, and nothing more. However, in 2011, a coworker pointed out that everything I spent on school could be tax deductible. I was thrilled! I decided to claim about 90% of what I spent at school in books, tuition, loan payments, etc. and it had a HUGE effect on my return. I'm talking going from a $600 return to a $2,400 return. I couldn't believe all these years I missed out on claiming thousands of dollars worth of taxable losses. However, I let it go and decided to take my blessing and be more aware of my spending in the future. Well, 2013, I had a VERY rough year financially. I got into a ton of debt, wasted my life on a horrible relationship, and nearly threw my life away. I've almost recovered completely, two years later. So, when I filed my returns, I owed federal since my past Job made a mistake and I really didn't make squat. No big deal. It was only $300 and my state return was $540. I could easily cover it. Well, they didn't take it out my state. I didn't notice this error until they sent me a 90 day past due notice. I freaked out and immediately tried to rectify the issue. Unfortunately, they would not allow me to break it up into payments. I had to pay the full $300 in one shot. Well, at the time, I was making $200 or less weekly and I could not possibly save the money to pay the $300 at once. So, like a moron, I ignored it. The IRS decided it would be a good idea to audit me. Well, no biggie! I've always filed correctly, and the only time I've had a sizeable return was when I was paying for school and could file my school payments on my taxes. According to the IRS, I never went to college! In fact, my entire claim in 2011 was fraudulent in their eyes. And they want it all back. All $2,400 of it. Well, now I make significantly more money than I used too. I've cleaned up my life, I've paid off almost all of my debts, and I planned on using this tax return to pay off the remainder of my debt. However, they snagged my return and left me with a measly $73! NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO COVER THE COST OF FILING! How is this legal? How do I prove to them that I went to college, that I paid $1,000's for books, that I paid thousands for loans, tuition, food, clothes, gas, everything that comes with being a student? I don't have receipts from my books, the only thing I have is evidence of my student loan payments, but that only covers 1/5th of what I claimed under my taxes that year. Can someone give some advice? I'm not the type of person that claims every possible thing under my taxes. I claimed school under it since it was such a massive financial burden on me, and I didn't even claim all four years of college bills, only one year! Truth be told, the government probably owes me $5,000 or more in the amount I've paid over the years for schooling, taxes, donations, etc. What do I do?

How should I allocate my money?,"I've got about $5,700 sitting in an low interest savings account earning me 1%. This is the back up to my $3500 emergency fund, my ""oh shit"" fund if you will. I am having second thoughts about that account and feel as though the money could be used better. 

Should I open up a Roth IRA and move the $5700 (I understand $5500 is the maximum yearly contribution) into that account instead? If by some terrible chance I go through my current emergency fund I can always withdraw my contributions with no hassle / fees etc from the Roth IRA account right? 

I have a traditional IRA with my company and am contributing to that monthly. I also have about 80k in 5 different student loans. I am already contributing extra payments towards my largest &amp; highest interest rate loan / month. Currently = $33,718.03 @ 6.07% interest. Minimum payment is $275 - I'm throwing $700 at it every month. 

For budgeting sake lets say $2800 / month are my expenses and my NET take home $3400/ month.

Should we gamble and go for the 25-year-all-loans-forgiven rule or try to pay it back as soon as possible.","My girlfriend did everything right in life.  She has no college debt, went to vet school in-state, and she even worked while in veterinary school.  She doesn't come from a wealthy background, and she had to borrow from the federal government for all of her loans.  She is now roughly $180,000 in debt.

I was thinking about the best way to try and pay these back, and I'm not sure what it is.  She is currently under the income-based repayment plan, and she is paying $200/month while she does a 1-year internship.  This will go up when she begins to make more money as a full vet (roughly $80k is the average, I think).

The question to me is whether she should pay the minimum and let the rest be forgiven after 25 years, or pay as much as she can now.  Her interest alone (I think the rate is 6.4%) is around $11,500.  With me paying for rent (I come from a wealthier family) and groceries, she could pay a big chunk of that off every year.

I haven't sat down to do the math, but I feel like relying on the government to keep its word for 25 years is big gamble, if it comes out that it is better to go that route.  Plus, I believe the amount forgiven is added to income, and then you pay tax on it.

Bitcoin,"What is ""Digital Leverage"", How It Can Be Offered In Amounts Exceeding 1,000:1, and Why Is It Safer Than Brokerage Margin Accounts?","Cross-posted from http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinDerivatives/:

I was asked how the UltraCoin wallet was able to supply leverage to BTC holders through their wallets and wanted to take the time to give a thorough, complete answer (as compared to the curt answer that was given earlier, my apologies). This is a layman explanation, or at least a verbose explanation. TL;DR, I will take some words to explain this, if you don't have the time to read it, the quick answer is that we use a multiplier - if you do have the time, please read on for that word doesn't truly capture all of what is going on.

I was asked how the margin was supplied, and I answered digitally. Many people in the financial industry doubt bitcoin and particularly blockchain related inventions because it differs from the perception of physically based financial entities in that bitcoin is primarily digital (although the currency and the vast amount of assets in physically based vehicles are primarily digital as well). When you go to your bank, and see your savings account with $800k in it, you are not looking at a vault with 800k pieces of paper in it, back by 800k little pieces of gold bullion or US military might units (guns). We all know that if we all went to the bank and asked for those pieces of paper, the bank will say ""no"" or collapse in the process of trying to comply because the (actual asset-back) paper is not there or is there only in fractional amounts. This is known as fractional reserve banking. Anybody who deals primarily in major currencies deals with digital currencies and digital assets, and if you deal with money center banks you are dealing with digital loans, primarily ""digital margin"". How is that, you may ask?

Well, when the Federal Reserve and the Treasury decided that the banking system needed more liquidity, they didn't go to the US mint and say, start making more quarters, nickels, dimes and dollars, they booted their computers and pushed a button that multiplied the money supply. They literally used a calculator and pushed the ""X"" button to put more ""digital"" money in the system. Of course that ""new"" ""digital"" ""money"" was backed by no more economic value than the smaller, older amount of money was so they essentially lowered the value of each dollar by adding more dollars (in numeric terms) to the system without a requisite increase in economic value to back said dollars, then took those new dollars (that were worth less per dollar) and sent them to failing banks to bail them out. The rub is, economically the banks weren't truly bailed out, they got more money that was worth less, so essentially were in the same position that they were in before...  BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The banks knew that most people and entities prefer to see the numbers and physical representations of value vs. the actual value itself, so they got away with the charade that is the multiplier effect. That's fractional reserve banking and Keynesian economic policy at its finest. 

We, at Veritaseum do the same thing as the central banks do, add a multiplier to the money to give you a greater level of buying power - save for one big difference, and what I would like to consider a truly saving grave. Our digital money is finite and although it is infinitely multipliable, it is always backed by the same amount of economic value per unit. So, if we multiply your exposure of $10 by a factor of 10(x), you get $100 of buying power. If you lose that money for whatever reason, it is gone, taken by the counterparty that won the trade. We can print you more money by pushing that ""X"" button just like the Fed, but you have to put up more economic value (in terms of BTC, which freely floats against other currencies to measure and gauge the market's perception of its economic value). We don't create the (perception of) value out of thin air, we just create the credit and by virtue of the way the system is constructed, you are forced to back said credit with the requisite value of the proposed trade - UP FRONT. If you lever $10 by 10x you don't have to put $100 up front (you can put any amount you want up front - $10, $15, $100, even $1000) but you will have the trade closed out and unwound for you automatically by the server once you have exhausted your real value backing the digitally ""printed"" money that we supplied to you. Thus, if you put up $10, and levered it 10x, you now have $100 or buying power. If the underlying moves 10% in your favor you get a 100% return on your money. If it moves 30% in your favor, you still only get a 100% return on your money because your gains (and losses) are bounded by the economic value that you put up front. You can't make (or lose) more than you have to wager, you can make or lose it much faster though, by turning up the multiplier effect. So, if the underlying asset moved against you 10%, the server will unwind the trade automatically because your counterparty is no longer protected with real assets in case of default. With UltraCoin, you can NEVER have negative account equity, there can NEVER be a case of FXCM, LTCM or Man Financial.

If we let you make more money than economic value that you put up front, well... then we will be acting in the same vein as the central banks and money center banks, to eventually have the same effect, booms, busts, and crashes with counterparties getting crushed by entering into deals where the other side couldn't possible pay. Think Bear Stearns (which I predicted their fall 3 months before the fact where Wall Street and ratings agencies still had buys and investment grade ratings - http://boombustblog.com/reggie-in-the-news/item/128, Lehman (predicted their fall months ahead of time as well http://boombustblog.com/reggie-in-the-news/item/154, WaMu (where I did the same), Man Financial, FXCM, etc. I actually know the global financial system rather well, so when I saw the potential of the bitcoin blockchain and a real application that could change the way financial transactions are done, folded up camp in my advisory business and jumped in the bitcoin fray head first - all in!

This new, blockchain-based, method of digital margin protects your counterparty from getting inflated dollars in lieu of real actual value despite the fact that you both entered the trade using ""digitally printed money"".

I see this as the best of both world, the digital world and the physical world. Now, I could have answered the question simply by saying we use multipliers, but if I did then I'm sure many would get the wrong impression and think that we're doing the same thing that the Fed or the Bank of England or the ECB does. We do, but we don't. I hope that fully answers your question, and if not, you know I'm always here to have at it again.",cryptocurrency,1424273949
personalfinance,Am I missing something about my company's 401k?,"I make 55k a year and my company matches 4% at 100%. They are 100% vested at 100% immediately.

I understand one should never cash out their 401k. I really do. But am looking for some verification if I wanted to use my 401k as merely a savings vehicle that I could cash out in 10, 5, or even 1 year from now and still be ahead.

My math is telling me if I contribute $2,000 a year, and my company matches $2,000, that brings it to $4,000. Even assuming no growth, if I cash out after 1 year I will be hit with roughly ~25% for federal, ~7% for state, and 10% which still puts me well ahead of my initial $2,000 contribution (that I would also normally pay taxes on if I didn't contribute).

personalfinance,Is there something weird about my student loans here? Should I be changing how I am investing?,"Loan data:

Loan 1: Original amount $5550, current balance $5400, interest rate 2.5%, minimum monthly $35.

Loan 2: Original amount $5250, current balance $4550, interest rate 2%, minimum monthly $28.

I've been making payments on these for 5 years or so.  Loan #1 used to have a much higher balance (higher than $5550) because I think it was accruing interest while I was in school.

Anyways, something just feels... off. Like these loans feel as though they are taking forever and a half to whittle down. I'm not sure if I am being screwed somewhere.

However, it's hard for me to justify throwing money at them. I allocate 10% of my gross salary (plus 3% from company match), or 13% effective into my 401k, and then I fill out all $5500 in my Roth IRA with extra money after that. This results in 21% effective savings rate or so (for my salary level). I do this because it seems like it's much better mathematically to put extra money towards retirement rather than debt, since the interest I earn from the market exceeds the interest I'd pay down on the loans.

personalfinance,Paying loans and retirement investing: /r/PF vs. math,"The traditional wisdom of this sub is to pay off high interest loans before investing in retirement accounts (other than 401k employer matching). However, this isn’t a particularly good rule of thumb because contribution limits exist. Let me illustrate.

Suppose you have a 40k student loan at a whopping 10% interest rate. Monthly minimum payments will be ~$500. Just paying the minimum, you will pay $25204 in interest over 10 years. If you pay an extra $500 a month, you ‘only’ pay $8362 interest over 4 years. So the opportunity cost of maxing out your IRA for 10 years (let’s just say you can contribute $500 a month for simplicity), is $16,842. That’s a substantial amount of money and you are probably justified in not contributing to the IRA. In which case you only lose out on 4 years of contributions, and maybe only 3 since you can contribute the first few months of the next year. 

Now let’s say you have an extra $1500 to spend (over the minimum $500). So either you put all towards your loan, or an extra $1000 to the loan and $500 to the IRA. In the first case, you pay $3543 in interest over 22 months. In the second case, you pay $4498 in interest over 30 months. A difference of $955. And you’d miss out on 1-2 years of IRA contributions. There is no way you don’t expect the lifetime growth of those contributions to exceed $955 (over what you would get in a taxable account you’d contribute to after the loan was repaid). And if you are somewhat more strapped for cash, even investing 1 year in a traditional IRA, the tax reduction alone would almost certainly be worth more than the difference. Meaning, even if your investment had 0% growth, you’d still come out ahead. There is no reason not to contribute to the IRA here.

**tl;dr:** When it comes to paying loans vs. investing, each situation is different. But generally, the more excess money you have to pay down the principle, the more likely putting some of that into retirement investing is a good deal.",finance,1424294140

personalfinance,What do you guys think of taking out a loan to consolidate debt?,"My SO and I are looking over bills. Everything is basically at where we can afford them, but it's just having multiple scattered payments a month, plus different interest rates, etc. We feel like we're just above water on everything.

He had previously taken out a loan for credit card debt consolidation. It was working out great and he was saving and paying it down, not touching credit cards... and then we moved out. We were comfortable enough to move out, but I shit you not, we had a ton of emergencies (mostly medical) that had us burn through savings and only left us with credit cards when we needed to skate by. We had extra for emergencies, but not the kind that's thousands in medical bills. It was too late to back out of lease and get ourselves balanced again (which I would've done if we could, everything happened right after signing the lease it feels like). But we had quite a few months of using cards for more medical emergencies (like those super fun surprise bills when you think you paid everything off), food, gas, even rent a time or two as we tried to build up our savings again to have just in case.

So, what would your opinion be on this situation? We're getting by, but not making a dent in anything due to the scattered nature and differing interest rates.

I'm hoping to get some guidance to see if it's worth it to go to a tax adviser to further discuss this, or if I should forget about it.


Last year I was an F-1 visa Holder, I got married at the end of the year to an American Citizen, and I got my greencard this January. For this reason I got my 1098-T (I hadn't gotten it before), which I think is clue number one that I can ask for the AOTC.


http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/American-Opportunity-Tax-Credit-Facts


In this website, they explain the AOTC facts for international students:


It says: ""You cannot claim the AOTC if you were a nonresident alien for any part of the tax year unless you elect to be treated as a resident alien for federal tax purposes. You also cannot claim the credit if you are married and either you or your spouse were a nonresident alien for any part of the tax year unless the nonresident alien spouse elects on a joint return to be treated as a resident alien for federal tax purposes.""


This leads me to believe I could get the AOTC.


However, there's a lot of lingo that says that F-1 visa holders ""In General"" do not qualify for the AOTC because they are ""non resident aliens."" But I am a permanent resident now, married last year, so I don't know what to make of this.


Can anyone help me with this?


Also if not the AOTC, could it be the Lifetime Learning Credit, or the simple tuition tax break?

business,What do you think of this guy's analysis of Guitar Center and Amazon?,"If this is inappropriate for this sub, I apologize. Let me know, and I'll remove it.

This isn't an article, per se, I ordered some financial analysis from his website a while back, and he sends out mass emails periodically, offering his analysis of the ""music trades"" market. I read it, and wanted some objective opinions on his analysis. If he's correct, then the relatively near future of both companies will be very interesting to watch.

From the email:

&gt;THE CURRENT OPERATIONS of retail leaders Guitar Center and Amazon.com call to mind the old adage, ""unsustainable trends cannot be sustained."" Guitar Center carries a debt burden that, absent some extraordinary event, it won't be able to repay. (Given the stock market's current lack of enthusiasm for brick-and-mortar retailing, a successful GC IPO would be ""extraordinary."") Amazon has a decent balance sheet but operates without making a real profit. You don't have to be a CPA to recognize that these financials are ""sub-optimal"" and will need to be addressed at some point. These unsustainable situations are worth pondering, because the fixes that both companies adopt could have a significant impact on the music industry.

&gt;Guitar Center continues to struggle in the aftermath of an ill-fated 2007 private equity buyout, when Bain Capital bought the company for $2.1 billion, loading it up with $1.6 billion in debt. The leverage was based on projections that Guitar Center's revenues would rise to $3.0 billion from $2.0 billion, and that ""better management discipline"" would increase profits at an even faster rate. Unfortunately, events in the form of the 2008 financial crisis rudely intervened, causing sales to flatline and profitability to slip. Absent the $1.6 billion in debt, the retailer would have easily been able to manage through the slow growth period. However, with annual interest payments of $160 million that were slightly above cash flow, the company was in a precarious position.

&gt;Last March, Ares Management gave Guitar Center a reprieve with a complex debt for equity swap that effectively cut its interest expense by about $70 million and left Ares with a 60% ownership stake. The original Bain investors saw their stake wiped out. Since then, Guitar Center's finances are no longer publicly available, but there are indications that despite the lower interest costs, all is not well. A CEO was sacked due to a 33% decline in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), bonds that were issued in March at $100 now trade at a deep discount--$83 for the five-year secured bond, and $64 for the ten-year unsecured--suggesting that investors are nervous. Topping it off, the new CEO has cut corporate staff. Collectively, this is not the kind of news that suggests that rapid growth is in the offing.

&gt;Absent the leverage, Guitar Center is still a viable business--think of it as a nice house with an underwater mortgage. The oft-published obituaries on brick-and-mortar are premature, and Guitar Center in particular still boasts viable locations and an organization rich in talent. To realize the potential of these assets, we suspect another round of ""financial engineering"" will probably be necessary. No one knows for sure how this would play out. The best hope is that bond and equity holders take another write-down and the trade creditors--which include most industry suppliers--are paid in full. The details of any reorganization are uncertain, but here's one thing you can bank on: Ares Management and the bond holders are out to maximize the value of their investment and have no sentimental attachment to the music industry. If it's a choice between sustaining industry health by protecting trade creditors or squeezing out an extra 1%, there's no question which course they'll choose.

&gt;Over a two-decade span, Amazon has grown at a torrid pace, has been hugely disruptive, has invested heavily in plants and equipment, and yet has never been really profitable. The company posted losses in two of the past five years, and in its best year had a bottom line equal to a measly 0.5% of sales. This hasn't fazed growth-infatuated investors, who have given the company a stratospheric valuation. At a current quotation of $371 a share, Amazon is worth 163 times earnings, and 16 times book value. Wal-Mart, by contrast, fetches a comparatively earthbound 15 times earnings and 3.5 times book value.

&gt;So what does this mean for suppliers and retailers in the music industry? Amazon's lofty stock price allows it to acquire companies and pay employees in stock rather than cash. Being able to use currency you create yourself, rather than having to rely on Uncle Sam's greenbacks, is a great cost saver that contributes to Amazon's cash flow. Investor patience is not unlimited though, and at some point a rich valuation will have to be supported by reasonable profits. To achieve a more substantial bottom line, will Amazon have to raise prices, charge more for its Prime Service, or adjust its shipping charges? We have no particular insights, especially given that Amazon, for a large public company, reveals very little about its operations. However, maintaining a rich stock price while running a profitless operation is ultimately an unsustainable proposition. It doesn't take a lot of courage to predict that something's got to give.

I'm hoping to get some help, as calling NY Tax Department has lead me with little answers. I filed my federal return through Tax-Act.com, I wanted to try someone different than Turbo Tax, because of their annoying pop up ads. I entered in the information into Tax Act and submitted my return. My federal file was accepted and my refund has already been received. I filed my CT (partial resident) on the CT website seamlessly and have too already received my refund. 

Now NY: I attempted to file on the NY state website as I had done with CT, however they do not e-file partial resident returns. SO, I went back to Tax-Act. Tax-Act seemed to create bizarre numbers and I had difficulties understanding the questions they were asking. It ended up showing I owed money, which is bizarre as I have extra deductions to ensure a refund (I know not the smartest plan according to PF). I decided to input the information into Turbo Tax- all numbers matched but it showed a refund in NY. I went through it with my accountant brother, whom assured me that Tax-Act was not calculating the standard NY deductions and was calculating my income at the wrong tax rate. Therefore, I checked everything twice and decided to E-file through turbo tax. Over a week later, my return was rejected due to not being filed with my Federal Return. I'm guessing this is likely due to using different software and tax software's only communicating one way. I called NY Tax department several times and continue to be advised to e-file through their system, though I clearly cannot (as also stated on their website). When I state that, they advise me to mail it. 

Ok- I print it from turbo tax, the top page from NY tax department states ""Do not mail this return, you must E-file it""

I'm at a total loss. I also really need the $300 return so I don't want to not file either. Calling Tax Act is $55 and Turbo Tax stated it wasn't their rejection error. I would also imagine that if I resubmitted my federal and NY through turbo tax, it would reject again since my federal is already filed.

gaming,"TIL that if you turn on a PS4, press up once, and then mash X, you will be out $80+...","Long story short, I got an email today with a receipt for an 1886 preorder. My first thought was that my account was compromised, so  I contacted Sony support and asked them if that was the case. She insisted that it was from my PS4, and that all sales were final, and that there was nothing she could do.

At this point I started freaking out, thinking that someone broke into my house and stole my PS4 or something. There was only one person at home, which is my GFs mom who isn't very good with technology. I gave her a call and the PS4 was still good. I asked her if she pressed anything and she said she accidentally pressed a few buttons, but the system was fine.

I remembered that she wanted to test her new sound system using the PS4. I also remembered that she was messing around with the inputs. I put two and two and figured out that she probably couldn't see the PS4 on the screen and mashed X trying to get it to show on the TV, and ended up making an $80 purchase.

First thing I did when I got home was check how easy it was to get to the purchase screen, and I was right, up and then a few Xs, and you've just spent some money.

Don't know why I'm posting this, I'm just a little miffed that the system allowed such a large purchase so easily. Not a single choice defaulted to ""No"", it's just X all the way. Also kinda miffed that Sony support was so unhelpful and just kept saying ""all sales final, deal with it."" I'm contacting support again now, but I doubt anything will come of it. Great. 

End rant.

EDIT: Spoke to support a second time, this time they were a bit more helpful. He put in a refund request but he said he had no idea if it would be approved. I won't find out for about 7 days. Thanks Mario, you're a pretty cool guy.

EDIT2: Talked to customer service a second time. This time I asked to speak to a supervisor. The guy was a dick. Complete dick. I didn't even press the ""accident"" thing, because honestly, it's too hard to prove that. What I did press was that their site says I can cancel pre-orders. Apparently their terms of service contradicts what the site says. I told him it was unheard of that I cant cancel a digital preorder, and that Bestbuy, EBGames, Futureshop, etc all allow cancellation of preorders, he said ""good for them, we are not them"". I mentioned how it was an accident and told him about the poor shop design, and he said I should have been more careful with my system, your fault. He said the only thing he could do was the same thing as the other CSRs, which is put a request in and see if it gets accepted or rejected in 3-5 days. But that's after the game's release, I mention that by then its not a preorder. I dont mind waiting, I just want a guarantee, I'm not going to risk going past the release date then being told I can't refund a game. He said if I get rejected, then I have no options and I own the game.

This is by far the worst customer service I have ever received. I am fuming. I know for an absolute fact that Sony has lost me as a customer. I've never boycotted a company, but god damn this made it happen. I've heard nothing but good things about MS in this thread, maybe XBone is the way to go. I'm kinda wondering if I should forward this to any gaming news sites, it's a small chance but maybe someone will care.

personalfinance,The fundamental principle of personal finance: maximize the return on your capital,"This principle is so fundamental that it can answer most questions people have on personal finance. ""Should I pay off my student loans or max out my Roth IRA?"" ""Should I get a mortgage or continue renting?"" ""Should I get a car loan or pay cash?"" If everyone understood this principle, then 80% of the posts and comments on this subreddit would vanish.

The principle is as follows: always allocate your capital towards the investment option that yields the highest return (adjusting for risk of course).

Example: You are deciding between taking a 2.5% auto loan or paying for your cash with straight cash. If you have the cash ready, it may be tempting to want to avoid the loan because, after all, ""debt is bad"", right? Wrong: debt is a **tool**. Take the auto loan, and invest your extra cash in a Vanguard mutual fund, at an equity/bond split to your risk tolerance. Even 50/50 (very conservative) will give ~6% on average.

Example 2: You are deciding between paying off a 5.4% student loan or contribution more towards your Roth IRA. It's always prudent to pay off the loan first, right? It's a guaranteed 5.4% return! The student loan interest is tax-deductible, so given a combined state and federal tax rate of, say, 30%, that 5.4% interest rate is effectively only 3.78% after taxes. Contrast that return to the average return of the US stock market: 10.5%. Even over any 30-year period in US history since 1926, the market has not returned less than 6%. It's a no-brainer: make the minimum student loan payment and max the Roth IRA.

personalfinance,Choosing a Bond Fund for my IRA,"Hello,

I think I might be over-thinking this one, and I'm afraid I've missed something and as a result might be posting something people will scoff with a generalization but here goes:

I'm trying to assemble a group of index mutual funds to complete my 3 fund set up, and I'm stuck on the bond fund. Basically, what should one be looking for in a bond fund? They all seem nearly identical, and they all invest heavily in government bonds. Is this what you want in a bond fund? Lots of govt bonds? This makes me wonder, based on my limited knowledge of bonds, about what will happen should the Fed finally decide to raise interest rates. From what I've read, it means the bond funds will tank for a while. So my question is this: Do I roll with a Plain-Jane bond index fund like a Spartan, Schwab, or Vanguard and just take the hit when it happens, or can I avoid this problem by choosing a bond fund whose focus isn't government bonds, such as TGLMX, and still get the same low risk advantage which comes from bonds in general?",finance,1424320539
personalfinance,"At what point should you just give up paying your student loans, enroll in IBR, foot the bill for 20/25 years, and just move on with your life?","Sorry for the long post, but I think this applies to a lot of people, so here it goes. 

I've had numerous discussions and posts over the past few weeks regarding massive student loan debt. I think a lot of that discussion has been informative, but I wanted to start another thread to explain myself a bit more thoroughly regarding this topic.

In short, many in this subreddit believe that you should wait to invest until you pay off your debt. Just take [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2wb809/roth_ira_managing_student_loan_debt_saving_money/) from yesterday, look at most of the advice (besides mine), and you'll see that most people advocate to not start investing until you pay your debt completely.

Conversely, I believe that once your loan balance is high enough, you should actually focus more on investing than paying off your debt. More specifically, once your debt exceeds $100,000, IBR allows you to reap huge benefits while not paying that much more over the life of the loan.

This huge financial benefit has been proven with recent research. A great resource is Ed-Central, whose mission focuses on low income students: ""We combine a steadfast concern for low-income and historically disadvantaged people with a belief that better information about education can vastly improve both the policies that govern educational institutions and the quality of learning itself.""

However, in writing about how IBR may affect lower income individuals, the [website writes](http://www.edcentral.org/beware-savvy-borrowers-using-income-based-repayment/):

&gt; In its current form, IBR provides larger subsidies to borrowers who attended graduate school than it does to those who borrowed only to finance an undergraduate education. The federal loan program lets graduate students accumulate very high balances, but imposes low annual and aggregate limits on undergraduates. Because borrowers with big loan balances can repay their loans under the same IBR terms as those with low and moderate balances, the bigger the loan balance, the bigger the benefit. What’s more, these graduate school benefits are available even to borrowers earning a high income during repayment.

In other articles on that site, the writers have proven that borrowers won’t pay that much more over time if they opt for IBR compared to standard student loan repayment. 

Take my situation, for instance (which I wrote about in third person for some reason [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2vz04t/why_does_this_subreddit_never_discuss_the/). Some background: I had to pay for four years of undergrad tuition, three years of law school, and seven years cost of living. I wasn't able to keep up with interest while I was in school, so my loans capitalized and were at a balance of $150,000 when I graduated. *Note: please save the “you shouldn’t have gone to school” for another day…that train has left the station and isn’t helpful to the 1+ million borrowers that have more than $100,000 in loans.* 

I luckily found a job paying $47,500 gross and take home about $2,600 monthly. My standard repayment (default ten year repayment plan) is $1,700 per month. That leaves me with $900 for rent, food, gas, car insurance, cell phone, etc. In other words, zero money to invest, despite being frugal and living in a low cost of living area.

With IBR, however, my payment is $325 per month. This is incredibly beneficial for several reasons.

First, this measly amount keeps me current on each of my loans. This is obvious, but when it comes to applying for a mortgage, it's huge--my debt-to-income ratio goes from 65% to 12.5%. Thus, being on IBR will allow me to apply for a mortgage.

Second, IBR allows me to begin investing. Simply put, I'm a huge believer that my money compounding over time will achieve leaps and bounds beyond any money I'm saving in the short term by paying off my student loans sooner. Yes, paying them off more quickly would allow me to invest more in my late 30s and early 40s, but that leaves a lot less time for interest to compound over time. 

Third, contrary to a lot of opinion, you never get “kicked out” of IBR. If you make more than the threshold to qualify (which is almost impossible based on the government’s formula if your debt is above $100,000), you remain enrolled in IBR, but your payment can never exceed the 10 year repayment amount anyway.   

To illustrate all of the above: I'm going to start maxing out my Roth IRA right now (age 27). Assuming a 7% return, my Roth is worth $375,000 total by the time I have to pay the ""tax bomb"" (with $137,500 of that being principal). Studentloans.gov estimates I will ultimately pay $160,000 over the life of the loan and have $160k forgiven, giving me a $64,000 tax liability when I'm 52 (so $224,000 total paid towards a $150,000 loan over 25 years). But, I pull my principal from my Roth, pay it, max out the Roth until I'm 60, and it's worth $605,000 when I retire.

Conversely, if I took this subreddit's advice and made the standard repayment, I really would have zero money to invest or save for a house until I paid off my loans (I also wouldn't qualify for a mortgage because my debt to income ratio would be bonkers). I would pay about $210,000 towards my loans in ten years (or just $15,000 less than if I were to go on IBR).  And then once I’m finally done repaying, I start investing when I'm 37 in my Roth. If I retire at 60, my Roth is worth just $329,000, or almost $300,000 less than the other plan.

Of course, like I said earlier, paying off my loans earlier would allow me to invest more in my 30s and 40s, and I might be able to catch up on my investments when I can cross that bridge. 

But is that the life I want to lead? No.

I don't want to be a slave to my loans.

I don't want watch my 20s and 30s go by as I'm stuck paying my loans.

I don't want to not even be able to buy a house due to my student loan payment.

I do want to travel.

I do want to start investing.

I do want to buy a house within 2-3 years.

And IBR allows me to do that, all while not paying that much more towards my loans over the long haul.

Yes, my student loans are something I’ll have to put up with for 25 years. I'll have to file separately (and thus backdoor my Roth), keep my AGI down in various ways, resubmit the IBR paperwork every year, set my payment up on autopay, etc. But in the meantime, I'll be able to begin investing, travel, buy a home, etc., all while not paying that much more over the life of my loans. 

So my question to /r/personalfinance is this: where is my logic going wrong? Every time I post something about this I get downvoted and criticized. But isn't there a point in time where student loans are in fact high enough that it's more beneficial to play the IBR game and just move on with your life?",finance,1424321309

The federal reserve is doing everything it can to maintain a 2-4% inflation rate, but it simply cannot do it. AmericaCoin would solve that problem by evenly distributing interest and tax burdens across anyone who owns the currency. Inflation would remain constant along with tax revenue and interest rates.

personalfinance,"1099 filer, just found out I owe $19,700 in taxes on $68,000 income. Isn't that kind of high?","So I was a contract employee for 50 weeks in 2014 and just met with an accountant to find out what I owed in taxes for the year. I had kept roughly 30 percent of each paycheck in a separate account in anticipation for taxes. He said I owed $19,700 total for state and federal, which I have enough set aside for, but I still thought that was kind of high based on some on-line calculations I ran. I'm a single male with no kids. Here's some numbers to help:

$4072 for Medical and Health Insurance Premiums
$3000 in deductions for work expenses (laptop, phone, mileage)
$2500 student loan interest deduction

Unfortunately, I don't have many deductions I can use for work expenses, believe me I tried to come up with anything legitimate. I know I get the standard and personal deduction too. I also know as a 1099 filer i have to basically pay an extra 7.65 or so percent for the SS and Medicare that an employer generally matches, but isn't $19,700 still kind of a high effective rate? Or is it because I'm single and a 1099 filer that I basically just get screwed?

EID 1005 V 1""

At the time I received that email, I had never heard of Aline or Visa prepaid processing. Today, I received another email from the company. It was a generic email saying that my card can hold more money, that it can be used for tax refunds, direct deposit of my pay, receiving government benefits, etc.

Some background info about me: I work for the Federal government, both as a member of the Army National Guard and as an employee with the Department of Veterans Affairs. I have no other jobs, and those paychecks are sent via direct deposit to my bank account with USAA. Last year, I filed my federal and local taxes with militaryonesource's link to H&amp;R Block online tax filing software. This year, I have begun my tax returns using the same service online but have not yet filed them as I'm waiting on my investment/banking forms (ie, 1099INT). I have several credit cards, and just checked my free annual credit report through the FTC. On my credit report, I see only credit cards that I recognize. 

However, since these ADP cards seem to be more like debit/ATM cards, I don't think they would show up on the credit report anyway.

I contacted ADP customer service, and they were able to locate 4 accounts with my name associated to them. They could not find any accounts with my last four of my SSN associated to them. They stated that they were sending a report to their back office, who would conduct an investigation and get back to me via email in up to 4 business days (I only called today, so I haven't yet heard back from them). They also stated that they cannot close or freeze the accounts, and that they don't know why I am getting emails, or what activity is going on in those accounts (even for the account they emailed me about, to which I had the last 4 digits of the account in the email they sent). I admit, I was speaking to a call center somewhere in South Asia (the accent was very clear in their English), so it seems likely they have little flexibility to go off-script.

I tried calling VISA to approach it from that angle, and they said I had to contact the bank if I wanted to close/freeze any accounts. Unfortunately, I don't know the account numbers for any of the accounts, nor what bank issued these cards/accounts.

tl;dr - I think someone or some group of people may have opened ADP Aline VISA cards fraudulently in my name, as I have never opened an account with them. What should I do, as these cards do not appear on my credit report (so I'm not sure freezing my credit would even affect them)?",finance,1424359537

I'm hoping to get some help, as calling NY Tax Department has lead me with little answers. I filed my federal return through Tax-Act.com, I wanted to try someone different than Turbo Tax, because of their annoying pop up ads. I entered in the information into Tax Act and submitted my return. My federal file was accepted and my refund has already been received. I filed my CT (partial resident) on the CT website seamlessly and have too already received my refund.
Now NY: I attempted to file on the NY state website as I had done with CT, however they do not e-file partial resident returns. SO, I went back to Tax-Act. Tax-Act seemed to create bizarre numbers and I had difficulties understanding the questions they were asking. It ended up showing I owed money, which is bizarre as I have extra deductions to ensure a refund (I know not the smartest plan according to PF). I decided to input the information into Turbo Tax- all numbers matched but it showed a refund in NY. I went through it with my accountant brother, whom assured me that Tax-Act was not calculating the standard NY deductions and was calculating my income at the wrong tax rate. Therefore, I checked everything twice and decided to E-file through turbo tax. Over a week later, my return was rejected due to not being filed with my Federal Return. I'm guessing this is likely due to using different software and tax software's only communicating one way. I called NY Tax department several times and continue to be advised to e-file through their system, though I clearly cannot (as also stated on their website). When I state that, they advise me to mail it.
Ok- I print it from turbo tax, the top page from NY tax department states ""Do not mail this return, you must E-file it""
I'm at a total loss. I also really need the $300 return so I don't want to not file either. Calling Tax Act is $55 and Turbo Tax stated it wasn't their rejection error. I would also imagine that if I resubmitted my federal and NY through turbo tax, it would reject again since my federal is already filed.

personalfinance,At what point is buying a house not worth it - plan to move in 5 years.,"I know someone here has done the math, probably a few people. I'm in the renting versus buying situation. I'm 29 and single (financially, not relationship-y), have AGI of 100k, and I've always been renting. I'm in a situation where I know I'll be in my current city, Austin, for 4-5 years minimum, but anything after that I'm almost certain to move. Who has an equation I can play with to determine whether it's worth buying now and potentially selling in 5 years?

I know the variables should include interest rate and payback period of loan, cost of house, home insurance if down payment doesn't meet 20%, HOA fees if it's a condo, appreciation, and taxes (tax rebate?).

The goal is to put in a home price, say 300k, and then mess with the rest of the variables to see what is realistic or unrealistic. My down payment at the moment is around 30k. The housing market in Austin is tough for buyers, but so is the rental market. I was spending 1650 a month in rent before my girlfriend and I moved in together and split the rent. I'd still be buying the house by myself and budgeting to afford the house by myself. There is something to be said for building equity with the amount I (now we) pay in rent. It could also be a good stepping stone to making rental income if I choose not to sell when I move, but I want to plan for the worst case which is to buy a house and have to sell in 5 years.

Thanks everyone!

personalfinance,Tax question on 1099 issued in error,"I setup a traditional IRA with Bank of America around 9 or 10 years ago.  The ROI was terrible so in 2014 I decided to move it to a traditional IRA with Merril Lynch that would allow me to make market investments with the money.

Bank of America issued me a 1099 for a retirement account distribution based on the above facts.  To me this is clearly in error since the money never left a traditional IRA account, and I can prove the money's starting point and ending point during 2014. 

My question is who do I contact to get it fixed?  Do I need to call the IRS and tell them the situation or can I explain this to BofA?

I am 23-years-old, make 65k/year, and have about $31,xxx in federal student loan debt (also have private loans, but they are in my father's name). I have listed the 8 federal loans below with their current balances and interest rates.

**Edit:** So I just read through the FAQ (sorry for not doing so before the post) on this and it seems like consolidation is not the best option:
&gt; For federal loans, the monetary benefits for consolidation are minimal; the interest rates are averaged and there basically is no discount. When the loans are consolidated, you cannot target the highest interest rates with extra payments. Only consolidate for peace of mind and a simplified process but, generally, consolidation is not worth it for borrowers. 

So i guess the better question is how to optimize my payments.",finance,1424363722
personalfinance,Considering taking voluntary redundancy to find my passion.,"Hey all.

I’m sorry if this is too vague/not finance-y enough to qualify as an appropriate submission.  If it is, if you’re able to point me to a more applicable subreddit, that would be wonderful.  Otherwise…

&amp;nbsp;

I had been considering leaving my job for a while now.  It’s not bad by any measure, but it’s not thrilling me.  It’s easy, and it pays well, but working 8-5 at a desk, staring at a screen, procrastinating for most of the day isn’t how I want my life to pass by.  I’m 29 and yearn to be physically active (I’m in good shape and have boundless energy).

&amp;nbsp;


Last week, **job cuts were announced** (I’m an engineer in Oil and Gas, so yeah) and the option to take **voluntary redundancy** was offered up.  I considered jumping on it pretty hard, and when I found out the other day that the package was actually enhanced (significantly) on top of statutory, my interest increased.

&amp;nbsp;


I’ve been with the company for 3 years, and long story short, the **redundancy package I’d be seeing would be ~£10k.**

&amp;nbsp;


I currently have a **mortgage** on a flat for ~£85k, paying **£395 a month.**

&amp;nbsp;


**The mortgage is due for renewal** at the end of May, and up to 90 days before that I can renew it- with interest rates being lower these days, I got a preliminary quote which would lower my monthly payments to £340.

  Annoyingly, the voluntary redundancy offer disappears at the end of February, so whilst applying to renew, I *wouldn’t actually* be employed.  I talked to my financial advisor and he suggested just keeping quiet unless they ask for proof of income, which they don’t usually do for renewals like this.  If they do ask, and I tell them I’ve been made redundant, they’ll likely bump me onto a worse plan which would see me paying ~£500/month.  

**I want to rent out my flat (estimated £650-£700/month**, TBC obv), and travel.   This is my biggest snag.  If I manage to secure a lower payment for my mortgage, that’s incredible, but if I'm forced onto the higher, that would actually suck pretty hard.  It would mean my margins are *very* minimal and I would barely break even whilst still having to pay rent on wherever I'm living, and that's before considering what I'd be taxed on if I worked to top up my income.

&amp;nbsp;


I don’t actually know yet what I want to do with my life yet-, and so I intend to use the coming months to actually discover this.  Visit friends in other countries, do workaway schemes, and cityhop whilst working the odd part time job maybe to just find a place I want to live, whilst discovering a job I want to do.  I am also seriously considering pursuing the possibility of becoming a CrossFit coach.  I have trained for a year, but have martial arts and coaching experience, and I know I’d love it.   

&amp;nbsp;


I have also been offered to come out to Austin to help some friends set up their business for a few months.  

&amp;nbsp;


Long story short, I’m terrified of this.  It’s something I want, but the fear of giving up a good career job for potentially nothing is a scary one, and many view it as a financially stupid move.  I mean, I might not get the choice, I might get made redundant anyway, even if I don’t take voluntary, but if I don’t, then I feel like I’ll have missed this huge opportunity to “discover” myself, or some hippy shit :)

&amp;nbsp;


With renting my flat out to cover the mortgage, and part of any rent I need to pay wherever I am, **what is, financially, my best plan for moving forwards from here?**  If I look for cheap rent, and live significantly below what I currently am **is £10k enough to sustain me in the short term?**

&amp;nbsp;


Could I potentially make it last a year, if supplemented with rent and part time jobs?  I don’t want to just work full time in a random job to live, because then why did I leave- I want to work a little to help myself out, but generally find what makes me happy, discover and have the time to pursue things like coaching.  
Hell, I’m even strongly considering getting a dog over this time, but I know I can’t/wouldn’t do that until I was at least country-settled.  

&amp;nbsp;


In an ideal world I’d like much more time to consider and plan my year/the coming months, but this deadline has been thrust upon me, and I’m eager to take it- plus getting a 10k boost is nothing to turn up your nose at.

&amp;nbsp;


**TL; DR:** Redundancy possible, considering voluntary.  Staying scares me for missed chances, going scares me for losing a stable income.  Is £10,000 enough to live low-key for 6 months- a year whilst I rent my flat out, and discover my passion in life?",finance,1424364921
personalfinance,Random Collection On My TU Report,"To start off, thanks for any insight to my problem!

I have been rebuilding my credit for the last year and my scores have all passed the 700 threshold, that was until yesterday. Looking through my CreditKarma account I noticed a collection has been put on me only in TransUnion! Quickly following that I went to myFICO to check it out there, and there it was. I quickly called the number provided by CK and asked what this collection was all about. It turns out it was from a stupid insurance company I bailed out on 3 years ago, I had no idea that I even owed them money! So I quickly paid the $123 and she then assured me that they will remove the collection from my account and it will disappear in 30 days.

 Today comes along and I still feel uneasy about the situation so I call them back. Now I speak to someone else entirely and he tells me that that simply isn't the case. He then says what they do is tell their 'customers' to call TransUnion and report it as unknown, then TU will contact them and they will ignore it forcing TU abide by Federal law and delete the collection after 30 days of no responses from the collection agency.

 My question is, does his statement hold any truth whatsoever? I am confident this isn't a scam, because I did have that insurance, but I just do not understand why they contradicted each other. Also, I never heard from my insurance nor the agency about the money I owe, it simply just appeared one day. What do you all think is my best course of action?

Thanks for the heads up!

financialindependence,New to FI. Judge my plan for the future.,"Hello all, 
About Four months ago I finally got a ""Grown up"" job after around 10 years of making around $20,000 with pretty much a zero savings rate. I discovered Mr. Money Mustache in January and have been gobbling up the articles since January. I've been using You Need A Budget since January also since I wanted to develop a better working picture of my finances, but I'm at a point where I need to start considering whether it is better to be working towards the destruction of my debit, or the growing of my assets.

Here is a rundown of my debt situation:

* No consumer/credit card debit
* $113,000 balance on my mortgage (Bought the house in December) at 4.125%. The Payment is around $1200 per month due to the inclusion of a PMI (~$50), Homeowners Insurance, and high taxes (about 50% of the payment, will go down in March when I can grieve taxes and some exemptions go into effect). Only around $160 makes it to the principle balance.
* $30,500 combined group of school loans serviced by Nelnet. This has a $350 monthly payment across 4 loans. The largest is $14,800 at 6.8%, and the rest varies from 3.4% to 3.8%
* $1,450 school loan through another servicer at 2.08% and I pay around $51 a month
* A car loan from my father with a current balance of $5600 at no interest, as long as I pay him $200 a month toward it.
* An $8000 ""gift"" from my grandma towards my closing costs, that I would rather look at as a loan to be paid back since she is on a fixed income. No current payment, and no interest accrual.

Here is my asset situation:

* Home with an assessed value of $120,000, I'm at around 6% equity. I suspect with mostly cosmetic renovations the value would be around $140k, and by redoing the kitchen and finishing the attic I could get the sale value up to around $180k.
* A job with a salary of $72,250 annually. We also get an annual bonus of around 7% in March. This year will be higher. I believe mine will be prorated to the amount of months worked in the previous financial year, but for future years we can consider an annual windfall of $5000 each March. 
* I also have a lot of overtime opportunity, if the company asks me to cover a shift on a day off I get overtime for the entire 12.5 hour shift. If I get 15 or so coverage days a year (fairly likely) my salary goes up by ~10k for that year. Annual raises are probably 2-3% but this year when I finish my certification around June, I'll get a one time $5000 raise.
* I contribute 7% of my salary to a company 401k, I have it set to increase 1% every June until it reaches 15%. The company gives an additional 8%. The account is pre-tax so it reduces my income level.
* I live with my girlfriend who currently covers the internet, electric, gas, and water bills. We are likely to get married and will probably combine our finances. I've slowly been convincing her we should work toward a 10-15 year retirement plan for both of us, and the idea that's working best so far is that she would be able to be a stay at home mom. Unfortunately we can't really wait 10 years to have kids, nor do we want to, being in our late 20s already. She makes around 30k per year and is looking for a better job. She also has around 15k in savings that I'm trying to get her to transfer to a vanguard account instead of letting it wallow in low/zero interest checking accounts.
* I have a vanguard account with around $1500 in it that I started contributing to in January. I think it will reach the $3000 minimum need to actually invest it in a fund in March or April
* I have an old retirement account from when I worked at the YMCA with around 7k or 8k in it that was all pre-tax in a 403b and could be rolled over to my company 401K.

My Monthly budget:
Bills:

* Mortgage - 1186.55
* Phone - 50
* Car Insurance - 56
* Netflix - 7.99

Spending (These are budget numbers, not actual spending, it's usually lower):

* Groceries - 200
* Fuel - 50 
* Restaurants - 150 (Working on cutting this down)
* Household development - 250 (Only been in the house 3 months, this is the budget for small repairs, improvements, furniture, etc)
* Emergency fund - 50 being set aside monthly
* Car Maintenance and Repair - 50 being set aside monthly
* Home Repair - 50 set aside a month for more major repairs (I also have particular months where this budgeted higher, we need new windows, and we need to replace our furnace before next winter)
* Dogs - We budget 50 per month for the dogs between food, vet, and some toys/treats
* Vacation - Setting aside $100 a month for a vacation in September when I'm off shift. The girlfriend and I have never gone on a vacation that wasn't piggybacking on my parents vacation. She would like to go to Harry Potter World, and I would like to visit NASA before we buckle down and commit to 10 years of extreme frugality.
* Vanguard Deposit - Going forward I'd like to do $500 monthly
* Car Payment - $200 to my dad monthly
* Student Loans - $400 monthly. Would like to throw at least $500 a month extra at my highest interest loan.

For spending reduction, we are pretty good with our heat/hot water/electric. All CFL bulbs except where we need some strong light (maybe two bulbs?) and we use a nest thermostat so we can adjust our heat on the fly based on what we are doing and where we are. We also keep the heat pretty low since we tend to run a little warm ourselves. 64 when shes home, 60 when its just me, 58 while we sleep and 54 if no one is here except the dogs (Akita/Chow mix, and Shepard/Spaniel mix, they seem to be pretty comfortable with it).

I know MMM doesn't really listen to excuses, but we have pretty bad winters here in Upstate NY, and though I'm no stranger to biking in them, the only possible routes to work are terrifying, and would probably double my commuting time since I live on one side of a river valley and work on the other, it's slow going up hill and the only bridge with a sidewalk is kinda far. I already work a 12 hour day so I'm not really interested in bumping that to 14 hours either...at least in the winter. Fortunately I generally only work 3-4 days a week so I keep my driving pretty low, and will be lowering it a lot more in the spring/summer/fall when I'll start biking my errands again. I do bike some in the winter, but this past few weeks were in the -10s and -20s and I'm just not that bad ass.
Finally, the obvious crap in my budget: Restaurants is being attempted to be sliced down every month. I'm getting better at remembering to make and bring a lunch to work, but it's generally take-out or the cafeteria at work that slowly drives that budget up 5-10 at a time. We might do dinner twice a month, and alternate paying it. Household Development will hopefully go down as we get all these little fixes done. I plan to budget out savings to do any renovations myself, and other then completing the back yard fence and replacing some windows and the furnace, any actual remodeling is probably 2 years out.
Groceries I think I'm pretty good on, I only maybe around 20k a year for the past decade, so I'm fairly frugal on food already and tend to buy in bulk. 
Car repairs savings is currently necessary since there is a bit of body damage on my car that A) would prevent me from selling it for more then the current balance of what I owe my dad and B) seems to be having an affect on mileage. The car is a 2010 Hyundai Accent, manual transmission. The model is on MMM's approved cars lists, though maybe not the year.
Vacation savings is pretty much lost capital, but this is a bit of psychological celebration for my new job and (hopefully) her finding a better paying job. It's also a bit of a last hurrah before we go pretty spartan.

Ok, so that is the rundown. Now as for what I'm looking for in advice: I know the most important thing is to make extra payments on my 6.8% loan since it's the highest interest cost. Would it be best if I just knocked out the 2% and freed up another $50 monthly to apply to the big loans principle?
Also, Once I pay the large loan off, is it better to pay the higher interest mortgage and get the equity, or keep paying the rest of the student loan off despite the smaller interest rate? Mr Money Mustache seems to imply all non-mortgage debt is a debt emergency, but it makes more sense to me to pay the higher interest mortgage. 
Also, Should I keep putting $500 a month into my vanguard after I get up to the minimum balance? or do you think it's better to just throw $1000 extra at the debt? The interest rates for everything except the first loan are pretty low, so I think gains from investing would net out to be greater income.

Sorry that was long. Thanks for any advice people can offer. With my current plan, my back of the envelope accounting has be debt free in 7 years, and retired in another 7.

My friend decided it was time to buy a new motorcycle, and while looking at bikes he decided to have his credit pulled to see what he might qualify for. This is where the issue came up. On his credit report is an unpaid medical expense that the Army Reserves should have paid but hasn't. He was on duty at the time of the injury, and due to the nature of it, they took him to a civilian hospital for emergency treatment. The Army Reserve still haven't done anything to pay for it in over 6 months, in the mean time his credit is getting a huge black mark and effecting his score enough that the lowest interest rate he has been offered so far was 20.99%. He didn't have bad credit before, but he didn't have much, his current credit score is very low 6's with this hanging over his head. 

Here is my question, what options does he have (short of paying the medical bill himself) in regards to either getting it off his report as it's not his financial responsibility? Can he report it with the credit agencies to have it removed? Any other ideas, please help.

TL;DR: Friend was injured on duty with the Army Reserve, and now his credit is tanked because the Army hasn't paid the bill yet.",finance,1424370910

personalfinance,Is there a better way to use my downpayment?,"I'm purchasing a car and have saved 50% of the total cost for a downpayment. Right now this money is sitting in a 30/70 stock/bond account at Betterment. 

(**Note:** *I understand and accept the risks of investing my savings. I also understand and accept that by using Betterment I am paying for a service I could do myself at Vanguard.*)

Interest rates on a 60 month used car loan are between 2.39% and
3.39%. I have excellent credit and an excellent debt/income ratio and would expect to fall on the low end of that range.

I have budgeted $350/month for a car payment and $450 for surplus, non-tax-advantaged, retirement investments in a 90/10 Betterment account (my 401(k) is already maxed, ESPP is maxed and also goes towards the surplus retirement account. Emergency fund is fully funded, other savings are budgeted for and on-target.).

It seems like I have a few (or maybe only 2) options here:

1. **Use the downpayment to reduce the amount I borrow.** Result: the 30/70 account is emptied, I make $350 payments on the car loan and contribute $450/month to the 90/10 account for the next 5 years.

2. **Borrow the full purchase price and draw down the 30/70 account to help with payments.** Result: I make $800 payments on the loan, with some portion coming from the 30/70 account. Betterment's ""safe withdrawal"" calculation suggests $285/month, which would leave me with $4000 at the end of 5 years in an average market and $530 in a poor market. This allows me to contribute the amount I am withdrawing from the 30/70 account to the 90/10 account. (Notice that this seems to be exactly the same as simply transferring $285/month from the 30/70 account to the 90/10 account and making full loan payments from cashflow. This brings me to option 3...)

3. **Borrow the full purchase price and invest move what I've saved for the downpayment into the 90/10 account** Result: everything I've saved for the downpayment amount is immediately invested in the 90/10 account. I make $800 payments on the loan from cash flow, but make no contributions from ordinary cash flow to the 90/10 account for 5 years.

(1) has obvious appeal: I take on less debt. I may be purchasing a home next year, so this may be an important benefit. Lower monthly payments also insulates me more against a sudden loss of income.

(2) seems like it's simply a less efficient way (in terms of taxes and expected return) of implementing (3). I'm curious if there's a benefit to this option that I'm missing.

(3) seems, strictly speaking, like the most *productive* use of my money. I would obviously expect market returns that exceed the interest rate of my car loan, so I should come out ahead here.

personalfinance,How does this tax credits work?,"I am specifically wondering about an investment tax credit in my province.

Basically, if you have a certain type of business, with local ownership and mostly local employees than you can solicit investment, and investors receive a 35% tax credit.

Basically, it appears that if you invest 10k, you get a 3.5k provincial tax credit.

That sounds pretty good, but how much money does that actually translate into for the person making the investment?

I would assume that it works like this...

For example.

If you make 100k... The Federal rate = 25% (for income above 70k), and the Provincial rate = 25% (for income above 70k)

The tax credit decreases your taxable income by 3.5k. Thus, you are entitled to pay 1750.00$ less tax for that year. 

Thus - for 8250$, you are getting shares worth 10,000$

Is that right?

Or do tax credits get deducted directly off the tax you owe?

EDIT: Nevermind - 2 minutes of googling gave me my answer.

""Several of the topics that follow refer to a tax credit. Although there’s a substantial difference between a tax credit and a tax deduction, it’s easy to get the two confused. A tax deduction reduces your taxable income, with the actual amount of tax saved depending on your personal marginal rate of tax.

A tax credit, on the other hand, is a deduction from tax owing. Provided the credit can be used, each taxpayer receives the same tax relief with a tax credit regardless of his or her particular tax bracket.""",finance,1424373978

I mentioned in a thread last week that I'm about to get a HELOC loan at 3.25% that will cover $11,500 of that debt. 

My plan is to pay off my wife's card entirely and put the rest, about $1,500, towards my own card. I know it is generally a bad idea to close credit cards, but is there anything I can do to get rid of her $59 annual fee without closing the account? 

My other question comes from the remaining balance on my card. I keep seeing offers to make a balance transfer to a new card with promotional interest rates that top out at around 9% after the first year. But these cards always have a 3% balance transfer fee. 

Why can't I just get the new card and then pay off the old card to avoid the balance transfer fee? (I realize this may be a dumb question) Is it not just treated as a purchase?

Also, if I'm going to do a balance transfer or full payment with the new card, what new card should I get? I don't travel enough to justify any of those cards and I basically would only use a card for groceries or gas. (And I'd only do this after I was completely credit card debt free)

Or maybe there's a way to negotiate my interest rate down on my current no annual fee card so I don't have to do a balance transfer? Or does that card suck enough that I shouldn't ever use it for rewards anyway?

I've come to terms with where I went wrong and am in the process of stabilizing my finances and hopefully getting a higher-paying job soon. 

As things stand right this minute though, I can barely scrape by on my credit card payments. I was told to look into debt management programs, and have an appointment in less than a week.

The craziest advice I was given was to stop all payments, let my accounts go into collections, let collections harass me a while, and then settle for much less than I owe. Pretty sure that's a completely terrible idea, but it did get me thinking.

Am I doing the right thing by going into a DMP? Could I potentially save much more money by going about this in a different way?

personalfinance,Looking to unlock a more efficient method than snowball or avalanche.,"I'm now well versed in the snowball (pay off smallest debts first, use money to pay forward) and the avalance method (pay off highest interest rates first as they cost the most in the long run).

I'm trying to come up with my own ""unlock"" method, which essentially goes after the debt that costs the least to ""unlock"" the highest monthly minimum payment. This is basically a modification of the snowball method.

The problem I see with the snowball method is you could end up spending $1-2k to pay off a dinky card that's only costing you $25 a month. If you had spent $4k to pay off your car, you could have $400 more a month! The problem with the avalanche method is if you're paying off your debts in a few years, the interest doesn't matter *THAT* much (yes, over 10 years it's enormous).

The problem I'm having is coming up with an equation to find the most effective way to do this. Here's my debts, rounded to make it easier for illustration:

Interest	Name	Balance	min payment

13.24%	Card A	$1,000.00	  $25.00

22.99%	Card B	$12,000.00	$350.00

19.99%	Card C	$4,000.00	  $100.00

0.00%	Card D	$4,000.00	  $40.00

10.99%	Consolidation Loan	$9,000.00	  $410.00

9.25%	Small Student Loan	$12,000.00	$120.00

2.60%	Car Loan	$4,000.00  	$310.00

6.80%	Large Student Loan	$40,000.00	$460.00

In this case, the ""unlock"" method clearly says that the car should be paid off first, freeing up $3720 (=310*12) a year. But after that, I'm not sure which one to go after next. I'm guessing the Consolidation Loan and then Card B.

Any advice? Or am I just trying to over optimize?

My question is, would it make sense to save up this $30,000 which would probably mean cutting back on our retirement savings for a little while? I do think we're ahead of the game there though. My other option is to take out a small business loan, or take out a loan against the equity in our apartment. I know I could take out the money from our HELOC at under 3% interest, but we only have around %30 equity in our home currently. I am assuming here that it would be more efficient to leave that $30,000 invested and take out a loan at hopefully a lower interest rate than I could be earning on the money, then pay back the loan over the course of a couple years rather than experience an immediate $30,000 dip in our savings. Is there anything I'm not thinking through here though?

Any insight would be much appreciated.

As long as what I typed in matches my budgeting spreadsheet I just made, that leaves me with approximately $650/month of spending money. I'd like to take $500 of that and dump it in the highest interest rate loans and work my way down. 

My question is, at what point would I be able to consolidate my private loans? I currently have been paying them for 2 months. The interest rates are insane and some of them have approximately $11 of my payment going to principle. It hurts. A lot. 

My mom is suggesting I establish 6 months of payments and then consolidate. Is there truth to that?

Also, would consolidating before I pay off those 11+% loans hurt me, since they drastically shift the average interest rate?

Should I attempt to setup a weekly (I get paid weekly) automatic payment on the high interest loans to negate some interest?

Is there any chance of getting a personal loan at 10% of lower for the total of the 2 11+% interest loans?

personalfinance,Credit utilization and raising credit score strategies,"I have 4 maxxed out credit cards.  While I am utterly devoted to paying them off and have devised a plan to do so in a pretty reasonable amount of time, I have a basic question that I can't quite get a handle on.  Is it better for my credit score to pay off one, and then the next and then the next or should I rotate through each one paying them down a little each month.  Disregarding total interest paid, I just want to raise my credit score asap.  Does the idea of having my credit utilization at or below 30% to raise my credit score apply to the credit I have available to myself as a whole or for each card.  I realize it will be faster to pay off the one with the highest interest rate first, and that's what I have begun to do but what should I do if I want to improve my credit quickly?  I am asking because I want to maximize these 6 months of paying off my cards by also increasing my credit score as much and as fast as humanly possible so that I can renegotiate the terms of my credit agreements or perhaps get a 0% interest card transfer card and then utilize that to knock off the rest.

personalfinance,Best way to pay student loans off?,"Hello Reddit

I have some quick questions since I am mathematically illiterate as well as relatively financially illiterate. I went to a very expensive school.  I got some aid and scholarships and such and worked full time while attending, but I still have really sizeable debt.  I am 22 and graduated this past May.

The debt is as follows:
University Grants
	1,500 at 7.00% interest with a monthly payment of $50
	3,500 at 5.00% interest with a monthly payment of $40
Government Loans (Direct subsidized Stafford)
19,000 spread among 4 loans with interest rates from 3.15% to 4.25% with a monthly payment of $192	
MEFA Loans –
	21,000 at 7.69% interest with a monthly payment of $240
	20,000 at 8.09% interest with a monthly payment of $220

So for the past few months (just started paying in December) I have been paying the minimum because I had to get rid of my credit card debt and I moved abroad which was expensive.  I have also just been saving because I like to have at least $10,000 at all points in a savings account as emergency funds since I have no family safety net that I would be able to rely on. Luckily now I have that and I will start to have extra money to be throwing at these loans each month! 

So my question is to save money in the long run on interest, where should I be putting this money?  I’m thinking obviously it would be best to focus on the MEFA loans since they are the largest and have the highest interest.  But should I be splitting it equally on them or should I be focusing on getting rid of one first?  Should I just worry about paying the minimum on the others until those ones are gone? Any other general financial advice based on what you know about me?

personalfinance,Beginner! Need investing advice for small starting amount,"Hey everyone,

I've been casually following /r/personalfinance for a while now, and have also looked the FAQ. However, I'd still try to get some advice more specific to me. I appreciate everyone's efforts in advance. You guys rock. :)

As a college student, I'd say I'm in a pretty good financial situation. I have my education paid for through scholarships, have enough money in my emergency fund, as well as enough money for all my other monthly expenses.

Separate of my emergency fund, I have about $3.5k of extra money laying around with the capability of adding $500 or more per month to it. For now I've been putting it in an Ally savings account since they have higher interest rates, but I feel like I could do better.

I've been considering opening an investing account with Vanguard and put that extra money in one of their mutual funds that is primarily made of stocks. I'm wondering whether this is a good idea, or if anyone has any better ideas. I'm just nervous about simply going for it because I've never done anything related to investing before.

For my financial goals, I'd like to have more wiggle room for graduate school, save for a new car, and otherwise just boost my general savings. I'm not concerned about saving for retirement just yet...I'd like to be done with school first before I think about that.

personalfinance,"Landlord is selling house roommate and I are living in. Considering buying it, but need advice.","Throwaway because people know my reddit name, and I want to avoid unwanted discussions with friends about my financials.  I apologize for the 12 meter high wall of text that will follow.

I am currently in school for the next 4-5 years.  I'm a veteran on the GI Bill, have a disability rating that nets me a decent chunk of money, and also work part-time making a considerable amount of money as a contracted software developer for a few small companies.  Lets say my monthly income is around $4.5k after taxes, but i'm mostly guesstimating.  Once I graduate, given my ~10 years experience and a degree, this will go up considerably.  Realistically i could be making 80-100k as a developer now, but i'm solidifying my future my getting my degree (especially since it's free, thanks GI Bill!)

tl;dr w/ the roommate:  I've lived with him for over a 1 1/2 years, he is financially stable, and I enjoy his company.  We're both in our late 20's.  We're not ""friends"", we're roommates that occasionally hang out, and that relationship works amazingly.   He's an engineering graduate student, i'm doing a BS/MS in comp sci.

So, the long and short of it is, this home is prime real estate for the school I attend in Boston.  It's 2 blocks away from school, on a historical registry which prevents it from being knocked down for development purposes, it's a couple blocks from a T line (metro/subway), and I will be living in it (hopefully) as my primary residence for at least the next 5 years.  After this, I/we could sell it OR maintain it as a rental property (again, prime real estate and a really nice house tbh), OR continue to live in it and work somewhere in Boston.  Currently plan *not* to continue living in this frigid snowy hellhole for my entire life.

The owner, however, wants to cash out and purchase a property in California later this year (there's something like a 45 day window where you can do that tax free or something), and my roommate and I have discussed purchasing it.  We haven't gotten the house appraised yet, but we're estimating it would close for ~$440-500k on the market, which means we can probably get it a chunk lower since we all want to avoid the realtor fee.  


Ok, so that's all out of the way, you know the price, you know my general financials.  Here's a bullet list of other things important to consider

* Rent is currently $2500/mo, and that's CHEAP for the area and what we're getting (~1200sqft brownstone).
* I qualify for a VA backed home loan.  No down payment required, and generally speaking better rates.  One-time fee waived since i'm a disabled vet.
* Mortgage estimator w/ my credit union has payments being ~$1900-2100 a month, at 3-3.5% interest
* my credit score is in the very good/excellent category (hard to know FICO, but credit karma has me in high 700's).
* My roommate has very very little credit history (car and school loans that just started).
* My roommate hasn't needed credit because his family is very well off, and i've become somewhat close to them.
* His parents considered purchasing, but are actually suggesting we (roommate and I) do it together.
* Co-signing a loan with him is a bad idea, because his credit destroys the chance of a good interest rate.  We've already discussed this at length, and he agrees.
* Co-signing with his parents may be an option.  Also, working out a deal separately s.t. they build a portion of equity based on the rent their son pays may be an option (i.e. i get the mortgage, they pay rent and whatnot, but build equity).  They may also be able to make upwards of a 15-25% down payment, on top of whatever i'm putting in.
* We've estimated the house needs around $20-40k worth of work to completely update (kitchen, plumbing, flooring) and bring up to par.
* ~5 years of mortgage payments (30 yr) would put ~$50-60k of equity into the home (and $60-70k to interest/taxes).  That sounds nicer than $50k going to someone elses mortgage.
* We know what the property taxes will be, the utilities bills (which we already pay), and the general wear/tear of the house at the moment since we've already lived here a year and a half.  We're well outside the ""honeymoon phase"" of ""how amazing our house is!"" (which we definitely had for the first 8 months).
* [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0] this says if we can find a similar place to rent for around $2k we should continue renting.  That's HILARIOUS for Boston, since a similar place for us would run $2600-2800 now, if not above $3k.

So that's where i'm at.   

At this point, from a getting-the-best-mortgage standpoint, either signing the mortgage myself or co-signing with my roommate's parents (assuming their credit is spectacular) is the way to go.  

But... I'm hesitant.  Very hesitant.  I know next to nothing about being a home owner.  I'm afraid to talk to my parents about this, even though they are extremely financially intelligent (as i type this i realize how stupid i am for being afraid to talk to them about this, I tell them everything else), because I don't want them to go insane at the idea of their ~27 y/o son buying a $500k house in Boston.  

This deal doesn't need to happen for *at least* 6 months, which is, i think, plenty of time to contemplate this, build an appropriate emergency fund, and work out details between myself and my roommate.  But that means it cuts into our equity time (bringing it down to 3-4 years instead of 4-5).  So... that's where I'm at.  

What should I be concerned about?  I've been trying to make a list 

* Not having the money to cover the mortgage payment because loss of job, falling out with roommate, and GI Bill stipend payments being delayed for some reason.  This, I get, can all be mitigated through appropriate saving. 
* Co-signing with his family, and his family suddenly falling on hard times (highly unlikely... highly)
* Co-signing and having a falling out with them, leaving a legal battle over equity.
* Something happening to current roommate, and having to play the roommate lottery with a house I own.
* House having major repair issues shortly after buying, leaving me with a massive bill
* General Liability issues? (Ice on the roof falling off, ice out front of the house, i would imagine homeowner insurance covers this)
* Hidden costs I haven't the first clue about?",finance,1424405299

personalfinance,Requesting feedback on my plan for reducing taxable income.,"Hello everyone, first things first -- thank you all for making this subreddit awesome. I've picked up a lot of useful information here that I've been using to improve my financial habits. I'm at a point where I'm pretty comfortable with my savings level and want to push it to be as effective as possible. I spent some time crafting up this plan for reducing my tax bill and I'd like to verify that my projections and the logic behind it are correct. 

My financial info: 

- Currently earning ~58k per year (will fluctuate 1-2k based on bonus but let's base the math off of 58k to keep things simpler). 

- Filing single, 1 exemption.

- I live and work in NYC (adds another tax factor, unfortunately).

My plan: 

- My income puts me in the ""25%"" category so looking at [the tax bracket table](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/10/30/irs-announces-2015-tax-brackets-standard-deduction-amounts-and-more/), I should be aiming to have my taxable income land close to $37,450 to reduce the amount of excess that I'll be paying. 

- $58,000 - $6,300 (standard deduction) - $4,000 (1 exemption) = $47,700

- At this point, I should aim to sock away $9,700 in my 401k to reduce my total taxable income to $38,000. I will then be paying close to the minimum for federal tax ($5,156 + 25% of the excess $550 = $5,293). I estimated $2,123 (NYS) and $1,276 (NYC) for annual taxes. Total tax bill for the year should be $8,692. Out of $58,000 gross, that's effectively a 14.9% tax rate. 


I've had this in place for the past few paychecks and my average tax rate vs. weekly adjusted gross income is 28-30%. How come it's not lower? Average weekly check is $1,100 - $200 (401k, health/dental/life insurance deductions) = $900 taxable. If I multiply the average tax per check (~$250/wk, which includes NYS/NYC tax, SS, etc.) x 52, the total is going to be $13,000 for the year. How come it's so high? I was expecting that these changes would be reflected on my weekly checks. Am I going to get a monster refund at the end of the year or is there something I'm not seeing?

personalfinance,Help! Avalanche or no?,"I am trying to ""avalanche"" my student loan debt. Should I throw an extra $1k a month at a loan that is $10,675 at 8.5% or should I put it towards a loan that is currently at $19,147 at 7.9%?

My understanding is always put extra money towards the highest interest rate - but over the coarse of a year, the larger loan will accumulate more interest.

personalfinance,Should I cancel a Credit Card or keep it open?,"Hi PF, I've recently been getting my financial house in order and getting myself on track to retire before I'm 90. Step 1, pay off the credit cards has been accomplished, but now I'm not sure whether or not I should keep all of them, and if not which I should cancel. I've been reading on how they affect my credit score, but I'm still unsure of what the drawbacks to keeping a card open are, if any. Currently I've got 3 CCs:

Capital One Visa Platinum: $500 limit, 18.90% interest rate, no rewards. Hasn't been used in 3 years, really only kept because it's my first card and oldest line of credit at 11 years now.

Capital One Quicksilver: $6000 limit, 16.90% interest rate, 1.5% everyday rewards. 6-7 years old, since they bumped me up to quicksilver and the better rewards program this has become my ""daily driver""

Chase Amazon: $2000 limit, 18.24% APR, 1/2/3% rewards on everyday/gas&amp;groceries/Amazon.com. 3-4 years old. This was my daily driver, but since getting the 1.5% on my capitalone this only gets used for amazon and 2% categories, fairly minimal spending and not a significant cashback over a calendar year.

I've been considering closing the chase account as my newest. Would it be better for me to put a recurring monthly payment on each and keep them open? What are the drawbacks to keeping a card open when you don't need it?

For relevance against my credit limits, my annual income is 35-40K.",finance,1424452962
personalfinance,Preparing for a dramatic decrease in income.,"My income will decrease from aprox $1850 a month to about $1100 a month in 3 years.  I am permanently disabled and receive SS disability.  I am also receiving child support.  The money I receive from SS for my child and the CS will quit coming once they turn 18 - in 3 years.  

I have a mortgage on the house.  I would still be able to pay the mortgage payments at the lower income, but would not have any money left over for repairs (for the car or the house).  In fact, I would be relying on state assistance for food and medicine at that point (assuming I would qualify).  

The house needs some serious work before it could sell for what I owe (I owe aprox 60k - the house needs a new roof, electrical work, the well screen pulled, and the bathroom needs completely redone).  I can try to get a Rural Development loan through the state to fix the issues, but I'm concerned I would still be unable to sell the house for what I owe - then have an additional large amount owed for the repairs.  

I want to be proactive and responsible with all of this but I'm not really sure where to start.  Can you give me a direction?

personalfinance,Student loan forgiveness vs. repayment with uncertain employment in the future,"My partner and I collectively have about $50,000 in student loans. We both plan to work fields that qualify for the public service student loan forgiveness program. So, after ten years of full-time employment and after making at least the minimum payment on the loans for ten years, our loans should be forgiven.  The problem is, my contract at a public university is up in about a year and she is considering grad school. My question is, do you think we should just make the minimum payment each month hoping that we will be able to use the loan forgiveness program? Or should we pay off the highest interest rate loans ASAP?

Here is some more info on our situation.

About $7,000 of my loans and about $12,000 of hers have interest rates of 6.8%--the rest of it is at 3.5%. We currently make around $5,800 per month after withholding, and we have about $22,000 in savings. Our other expenses roughly break down as follows.

Rent: $860 per month

Utilities: $200

Cell phones: $50 per month

Food: $600 per month

Gas: $100 per month

Misc movies/travel/eating out: $600 per month

Her student loans: $400 per month (minimum payment)

My student loans: $250 per month (about $100 over the minimum payment goes to the 6.8% loan)

Some other things to consider: I am currently a visiting professor of math and my contract will end in about a year. She is a research assistant in applied sociology and is thinking about entering a PhD program in social work in about six months. She's already stated that she won't enter a program unless she is fully funded, but even so her income will likely be cut in half from $40,000 a year before tax to about $20,000. I hope to make at least $60,000 before tax from here out. There is a good chance that when my contract is up in about a year, I'll get a tenure track position at the same institution. But if not I might end up working in industry (which wouldn't qualify for the loan forgiveness program).

12k in credit card debt @ 9.9%
18.5k or so in credit line @ variable between 12 to 15.5%

Desjardins being a terrible bank, I'm moving away and starting over fresh. Here's a breakdown of what I was expecting to do:

* Open a loan to transfer all debts to a single payment, either weekly or bi-monthly. (Interest rate should be lower then both the credit line and credit card easily)
* Open up two savings account; one to deposit 20% of all weekly income for income tax (automatic) and one to deposit the GST charged to clients (through the shop) which are due every 3 months or so.
*Checking account for rent and other expenses
*Reduce credit cards from 14k to 5k

I'm looking to get out of debt as soon as possible, I'm taking steps to cut back on expenses and if necessary I can provide a breakdown of my costs and expenses.

personalfinance,Duplex as a first home. Is this a good idea?,"My wife and I are in our early 30's and looking to buy our first home. We need to live near Milwaukee, WI for work related reasons. We were considering buying a duplex and living in it while we save up to buy a single family house, which I figure would take about 2.5 years. We would keep the duplex as a rental property and sell it once the mortgage is payed off or keep renting and collect the cash.

Duplexes range from $115k to $180K.
Ideal single family home in the countryside or quiet suburb currently sell for $180K to $250K.

We have lived in duplexes before and have family members who also live in a duplex and rent out half, so we are not a stranger to the responsibilities and living considerations of being a landlord.

Here are some considerations:

* We are planning on starting a family soon and do not want to raise our kids in city or surrounding area once they become school age

* Our biggest fear of buying a duplex is ""getting stuck"" where the neighborhood or home value tanks and we have to stay living there

* Getting a $220K house now would be very nice and would not be out of reason, but it would make it difficult to pay off the student loans or home early, especially if we are starting a family

* We don't want to ""miss out"" on the opportunity to move to a quiet neighborhood. People are moving out of the city and we don't want to be priced out of getting a home in say 3 years if interest rates or home prices shoot up

* Only other debt is a $300 car payment.

A $4,463 loan with an interest rate of 6%.
A $1,964 loan with an interest rate of 2.33%.
A $2,917 loan with an interest rate of 6.8%.
A $2,320 loan with an interest rate of 6.8%.
A $6,104 loan with an interest rate of 3.75% - (Potentially relevant: I share payment on this with my dad - it started at $35,000, and a few years ago I put a lump sum of $10,000 toward it [my money, not his].

I feel like I could get much better then that if I could just get my CC utilization knocked down a few notches. 



&gt; Denton, TX, USA
&gt; *edit: I would like to clarify that I am not looking for a huge loan for all my debt, but several small to medium loans $100-500+ to help me more quickly lower my utilization on credit report.
&gt; Around July of last year my grandmother became terminally ill. I decided to lower my working hours in order to care for her. I am a working professional who can make around $44,000/year when allowed to work on a full time basis. During this time I developed a large amount of credit card debt (10k), with rates generally around 19-24% interest. I am currently trying to consolidate my debt now that she has passed, but my credit score is shot with all the high utilization. I am currently seeking loans in any amount the lender feels comfortable, with interest between 5-10% for around 2-6 months (up to lender) which will make the lender money while allowing me to remove some debt from my credit report so I can eventually get a good consolidated rate.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I understand I do not have a cReddit history yet, but if allowed I can provide proof of active employment, my current nursing license (available publicly online), and any other relevant info. I prefer to use paypal.
&gt; Some other key points about my situation:
&gt; 
&gt; * I am safe to lend to because I currently have with tax refund around $8k in liquid cash in savings,
&gt; I am going back to school for speech pathology so I am currently only able to work 25-50% of my normal professional hours so I can’t work enough to take out large chunks of debt quickly to repair my credit score.
&gt; 
&gt; * Why not use the $8k to pay off credit card debt? That will happen to a small extent, but due to the fickle nature of my occupation I can sometimes go days, weeks, or a month with little to no work while my patients are out of town or hospitalized so I have to keep a large saving account at all times while in school.
&gt; * I am happy to accept even small loans because any bit helps, and it would establish my history as a reliable borrower.

So here's the back story. I'm 27, married with a baby on the way. I make about 85k a year, the wife is unemployed. I have a mortgage for 212k and money in different bank accounts totaling 160k. I realized that I have a lot of liquid assets in the bank and wanted to put my money to work so I asked a trusted friend the name of his financial planner.

I met said financial planner and over the course of several sessions he had advised me to up my insurance coverages on home and auto and seek out an umbrella policy for protection. As part of this foundation of protection, he suggested I consider to get something other then my work covered 160k life insurance policy. He suggested the value behind permanent life insurance. When he described it, it sounded great! He really was selling it as an investment vehicle.

When I saw the proposed plan, some red flags went up. It is a one million dollar policy with a premium of per year is $3,000. The guaranteed cash value is based off of a 4% interest rate.

What also concerned me was the amount of money that was suggested I invest into. He suggested that I invest 25k a year for the first two years and then cover the premium for the next three years so that the interest builds up enough to cover the premium and contribute to the net.

When I turned to Reddit because of my concerns, they were amplified by the vast majority whom swears against this type of policy. So what do you think, Reddit? Are my concerns valid and would my money be better off in term and investments or is this really the good deal that the financial planner suggests?",finance,1424480454

Regardless, I ignored them for about 4 months with the mentality that since they're closed, I'd divert my attention elsewhere. I quickly then started caring about my credit and started negotiating with those who called. Any that went into collections were quickly settled and then I got it in writing to have the collector remove from all bureaus that they reported to. Any others were completely paid off and though not removed, the creditors have positive remarks on my reports. I also used Lexington Law (a slight rip off overall) to do some cleaning. 

My score are now mid to high 600's, which is great to me....but I still have 1 company that is just stubborn - 1st Financial Bank USA. They REFUSE to settle with me. They REFUSE to offer anything except a 12% interest rate on the closed account. I owe now $3k w/an autopay for $150/month which has been that way for nearly 3 years now. I &amp; Lexington Law have sent them letters and they refuse to balk or even bend. 

My account is closed, and has been closed since 2010. It doesn't pain me to see ""settlement"" on my credit report next to them. I just need a way to get them to give me some type of bone. 

I'd love to just go ahead and pay the $3k to them, but, I'm paying for my own grad school classes this year in hopes of being accepted unconditionally in the fall.

I managed to sell it for $500 more than I owed. I then bought a reliable car for $2000 cash that I plan on driving for a while. I no longer have a car payment and my insurance has been cut in half!

personalfinance,Bills are racking up and I don't know what to do. Use Tax return on debt or use as a cushion?,"[[[pre-edit:

We live in the north, where taxes and living costs are fcking ridiculous. If we lived in the south with the same money we make we would live like gods.]]

I am married as of this last December.

Wife makes $17.50/hr.

I make $18/hr.

We have two Children.

I was thrown into an ambulance from an urgent care facility and rushed to the hospital with meningitis a while back. 

My overtime hours (which I was getting about five a week for the previous 15 months) were cut forcibly, which cut about $500 from our income.

Wife is not allowed overtime either. 

Our tax returns were only about $5000 from state/fed and we have yet to receive them.

I have a little over $13,500 in CC debt. $12,000 for car payment. Wife's student loans of about $8000. My student loans are still in deferral and they will equate up to about $50000+ by the time we can start paying on them. On top of that there's a $150k mortgage to worry about.

Now we have $1000 in an Ambulance bill. Upwards of $3000 in medical bills from 13 hours in the ER and several days of hospital stay. (turned out to not be bacterial, luckily).

Our plan was to sit on the tax return as a cushion, as we have been paycheck to paycheck for the last three years. (I am chronically underpaid--was making $28/hr as little as three years ago). 

I have requested financial community assistance from the hospital and am shortly to submit the forms. Now the ambulance bill from a private company is messing up the works.

On top of this, my car is sitting at 190k miles and is trying to fall apart. Wife's car flat out died which is why we got her a new one. 

Basically---we have zero wiggle room.

I had everything planned. We had money left over each month. Had.

If I burn the tax returns on hospital/credit card debt, we are left with nothing if things go south, like if my car bellies up. We have no way to get both of us to work at that point--wife works a completely different shift that makes it impossible to car pool.

Though I can telecommute (and do for night work) I am still required to be able to get to the office. 

I have had my resume out there for finding a better paying job. I have a rough equivalent to $19/hr given what work covers with tv/internet (I work for an ISP).  

Still kicking myself for taking this job with lower pay (the work interests me) because it has made things harder. But they were manageable before the medical bills hit. 

Originally the plan had that the car, the credit cards, etc would be paid off by that point making them manageable. 

I just don't know what to do at this point. I have 3 years of deferral to use before my student loans start coming due an that's going to be $500/mo. 

I'm risking collections if I don't figure something out.



edit:

Also, wife and I are wanting to get our own little small businesses off the ground. She's got a potential 90% profit margin for what she does, and I want to do a side-computer help business that I run out of my office. Both take a little bit of startup capital (my server equipment has broken and needs parts I have been unable to replace for the last several years, and she needs materials for hers). 

Neither of these are options if we just pay the bills all up front, because then we are just stuck with no option of getting out for another X amount of time before we get more capital from whatever else. You know, like a long lost rich relative dying and leaving us everything sort of thing (not happening).

That leaves about $137 each month.

This is before medical bills which I have yet to include, or ambulance ride which I have yet to include.

My kids have already outgrown the clothes we bought them all of 3 months ago. 

I've already taken it upon myself to run down our grocery costs. 

We are planning on taking a loan out on our tax returns and paying back ourselves once we have some success with the small side businesses. That way we can create additional venues of income.  We were originally expecting a far larger tax return and flat paying the high interest cc off entirely opening up another $125 that we could put towards student loans since those are higher interest than the car.

Thank you for all of the responses.

Few things:

1) Obviously I'm the one that needs to grow up. Wife is onboard with going budget crazy and knocking debts out. She's just less frantic/worried about it than I am. Guess I'm high strung.

2) I've convinced the wife to stop going to Justice (she likes the ""sales""). Goodwill and SalvArmy are fine for the kids. Clothes are only going to last a few weeks anyways with the rates that they grow.

3) Furniture: I can't justify replacing the couch, honestly.  But our kitchen table was down to 3.5 chairs and the kids couldn't really sit in it. We were otherwise living out of boxes for our clothes. Should we have? Probably not. Should have gone to goodwill and saved. Emotional decisions are emotional decisions. But hey!

One of my loans is $15k-ish at 7.25% interest with 208 months 17 years 4 months left to pay.  My bank offered me refinancing on this loan and I was approved.  My current minimum payment per month on this loan is $128.  Between all my loans, I pay $936 a month which is pretty hard for me so I'm not completely sure but I think the interest rate rising too high would really hurt me due to the amount of debt I have.  The disclosure says ""The maximum rate on the Education Refinance Loan is the greater of 21.00% or Prime Rate plus 9.00%."" which I'm not quite sure what that means.I've decided I can afford either of the following:

1) 15-year fixed loan at 6.74% with $130 minimum payment

2) 10-year variable loan 4.84% with $160 minimum payment

I also get a .25% discount off this interest rate for automatic debit.

personalfinance,Personal Savings vs Paying Off Student Loans,"Hello Reddit! I need a bit of advice.

I'm 26, and in the last 3-4 years, I have become obsessed with my credit and finances in general. I made a lot of stupid decisions when I was younger, and as a result had a bit of credit card debt. After some budgeting and determination, I was able to completely pay off the $4k of CC debt early last year.  Now I use one specific CC every month for all my expenses and it is paid off every cycle and I even get points! Hooray! But now I want to tackle my student loans which are at ~$17k @ 5.5% and all are federal government loans. They are my only current debt.

I've worked for a local government for 2.5 years. I make about $38k a year.  Besides the City pension plan for retirement, I also put in about $100 every 2 weeks into a 457(b) plan. I live in a very expensive city, so my rent is $1725 a month but it's split between 3 people, so I pay $575. I don't have a car because it's unnecessary- I work 5 blocks from my apartment and my boyfriend owns a car that we both use, which is paid off. Besides rent, my only other expenses are utilities and food. Because of this I am able to put a good chunk of my pay into savings every month.

My question is: I have about $7k saved up. Every single day I contemplate just throwing the full $7k toward my student loans, but I know I shouldn't because I would have no emergency fund. AND I just found out through work about Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which basically means after 10 years of making my student loan payments (I'm on Income-driven payments), the remaining balance would be forgiven. I would have to stay working at my current job through these 10 years. I plan to retire from there anyway so that's not really an issue.

Also, I am currently taking a few pre-reqs at my local community college that I need in order to apply for a Masters of Mathematics (I have a BBA in Finance so these classes are required). I'm paying the tuition out of pocket, but once I get into the Masters program I will have to yet again take out more loans to pay for it. That'll be another $20k to add on. I need this Masters in order to get a big promotion at work.

So, PF, what should I do? Should I suck it up and just pay a big chunk and try and get rid of my student loans as soon as possible? Or live with the payments ($88/month) for the next 9.5 years, as well as have it hanging over my head, but have it forgiven?

personalfinance,Questions about credit following up from FAQ,"I have some questions about how to build good credit, following up on the credit FAQ.

The FAQ says that opening a new credit card will count against me in the ""new credit"" and ""length of credit history"" categories.

My follow-up questions:

- Does raising the credit limit on an existing credit card hurt me in the new credit category?

- I recently got a merchant credit card in order to get the discounts associated with the card. Did this hurt me in terms of new credit, and if so, can I fix it by closing that card?

- The FAQ doesn't mention there being more than one kind of credit score. When I get my free annual credit score, I can see an actual number from Transunion/Equifax/Experian. But when I recently bought a car, the dealer pulled my credit and told me I had no credit score. They said there is a different score for auto loans than for credit cards. Is that accurate, and if so, how can I see the score that is used for loans / mortgages? (It is conceivable I'd have no credit score for auto loans because I had never had any kind of credit but credit cards and I lived outside the country for several years)

- Is there any way to gauge how good or bad a credit score is in terms of how practically useful it is to you? I see web pages that say anything above a 760 will qualify you for the best possible interest rate on a mortgage, but then Transunion's credit report calls anything less than 800 a C. Is Transunion just trying to make people freak out and pay them for advice about how to improve their score, or is a 760 indeed not actually good enough for most people's needs?",finance,1424544338
personalfinance,Where should I be allocating my finances first?,"Hey PF, I've been paying a bit more attention to locking down my financial situation lately and I figured I would post here to get some opinions on what my best options are. Here is my current situation:

-22 years old

-75k salary

-750 FICO

-about $1500 in monthly living expense

-20k savings

-401k from older employer worth about $1500

-18k car loan debt at 5.5% interest (I chose to finance with the dealer as they offered a $1000 rebate for doing so, however in doing so i signed an agreement saying I wouldn't refinance or pay off my loan for 6 months. For this reason, I determined it doesn't make sense to pay anything but the minimum until this march.)

-11k remaining student loan debt at 3.8% interest

-contribute to current employer 401k for effective 4% match. I've chosen to invest fairly aggressively here, mostly stocks. a large portion to a fund that tracks S&amp;P 500, some mid-cap stocks, some international. I chose some of the lowest expense ratios I could, but they are still near .8-.9 for all investments. I thought this was logical given my age.

Thats pretty much where I stand. I have been looking at rolling my old 401k into a roth IRA (I was told by a rep at vanguard to first roll into a traditional IRA and THEN convert to roth). I don't have any other investments right now, and I've been reading that it doesn't really make sense to invest until you're maxing out your retirement accounts anyway.

I guess my question here is, what should i really FOCUS ON FIRST? I should be able to refi my car loan with my credit union in about a month @ 2.7%. For this reason, obviously it makes more sense to pay down student loans first. However, I figured since the interest rate on that is quite low anyway, perhaps I should actually be maxing out my roth IRA first, since it is likely I can earn a higher return with those investments? Does this just come down to risk aversion? Should I even open an IRA if I have outstanding debts I can pay  down?

personalfinance,"Options for jobs…which would be most advantageous over the next 3-5 years? Advice, input, etc!","Hello reddit! I am a 25 yr old female, needing a little advice! I have no children (not planning on any, ever!), I am married (he just travels with me), and we have a dog. A little background to my problem (if you can call it that!) I am a medical lab tech (MT/CLS), which means (in a nutshell) that I'm the one who does all of your blood testing, checks your strep throat swab, gives out blood to those that need it, and generally analyze anything in the hospital that might help the doctor determine your health issue. I am a traveling tech, which means that I am contracted out through a company for temporary assignments (usually 3 months, longer if I want to stay!) and the company gives me free housing, pays for my car (or rents a car for me) and pays for my food. I just pay the taxes on the stuff they give me. It's very lucrative, and fun!

While I have been doing this current job, I have also been working a per diem (as needed) shift at a close-by local hospital that is hurting badly for a tech. They have a terrible lab manager, who is retiring this month, and he's their only full-time employee, so they have offered me the position of lab manager (kind of unheard of for someone who hasn't even been in the field 3 years, to be fair I am exceptional at my job). I have also been offered a job at the hospital where I am doing my current contract. So basically, I have 3 job options on the table, all of them awesome! I can stay a traveling tech and go basically anywhere in the US and have no bills, or I can take a permanent job at one of the two small hospitals. So here's my financial summary as of RIGHT NOW, working a contract at a small hospital in California (this would essentially stay the same if I continued to be a traveler):

- $30/hr (I work 40 hour weeks)
- Car per diem of $150/ week 
- Food per diem of $295/week
- Housing cost of $1000/month (includes all utilities and cable/internet, paid by my company
- On call (20 hours/week) pay of $2/hour, BUT if I get call in during those 20 hours I make $45 an hour, with a minimum of 2 hours every time I am called in. 
- I am taxed on all of this money, including the housing allowance, car and food per diems. 
- PAID WEEKLY (one of the best parts of this whole thing).

Now, I am having an absolute blast traveling! I have no debt, with the exception of my new car, for which I pay $350 a month (easily covered by the car per diem my company gives me). Here's a breakdown of our bills:

- $175/month phone bill
- $480/month health insurance (we buy it privately, in case I change travel companies)
- $100/month car insurance
- $350/month car payment

With all of this, we come out very well! So that being said, I will list the other two offers on the table. Let's call the hospital where I am currently working as a traveler as Hospital #1. Here's the offer for Hospital #1 if I took a permanent position:

- $55/hour (40 hours a week guaranteed)
- On call pay $2/hr (same as above, call back is 1.5x the hourly pay with 2 hours automatically if I get called back)
- Health insurance, good retirement plan, possible pension? (Will have to investigate further.)
- Super easy job, 4 days on 3 days off, same schedule weekly. 
- Small lab, little to do (I spend quite a bit of my day reading, playing on my DS, etc)
- I will probably have the opportunity to manage the lab eventually, probably within the next 3-5 years. 
- Coworkers are great, hospital is awesome. They are going to build a new hospital within the next 5 years, so new stuff! Yay!
- LOW LOW cost of living. Average cost for a 1br/1 bath house rental is $500/month.
-No responsibility once I leave work for the day, work stays at work.
- I would be making roughly (low end) $115,000 (gross), (high end) $133,000 (gross) annually. 

Here's my option for Hospital #2:

- Lab manager. I would have total freedom to redo the lab, which is currently not up to snuff. I would have to redo the entire thing, organize and make sure everything is up to safety codes with both state and federal government agencies. Kind of a pain, but I would be in charge and have everything done my way!
- $65/hour (minimum 40 hours a week, probably more)
- 1.5x for anything over 40 hours
- $2/hour on call, and 1.5x Pay ($97.5) for any time I would be called in. 
- Being called in varies every week, but around 5 hours of being called in every week. 
- In the scenario I anticipate at this hospital, I would be working M-F, 7am - 530pm, and I would be on call any time I am not actually working (totaling around 113 hours of on call per week).
- Health insurance I would continue to pay privately, since I have been told benefits at this hospital are wacky. 
- The ability to put on my resume that I managed a lab, which would be very beneficial when I resume my traveling career. 
- For housing situation, about the same cost of living for option #1. Might (big maybe) purchase a house, due to low number of rentals. 

It is possible that this hospital could hire another tech to work under me, but they would be working around 10-20 hours per week, and take some of the call. (which I am indifferent to whether that happens or not)

- Because of some variables, I estimate that I would make roughly (low end) $135,600 (gross), (high end) $211,000 a year, depending on call, overtime, another employee, etc. 

Also, I love my job and love working (so I have no problem working 40+ hrs/week, especially when I can play Pokemon/Read/watch HBOgo for a fair amount of that). I like being able to come home and chill with my favorite person and my puppy dog. 

Regardless of which option I take (continue traveling, Hospital #1, or Hospital #2), I prefer my husband to continue being my stay at home man candy (he has absolutely no problem with this, nor do I!).

If I do take a permanent position at either hospital, I am only considering this to be a 3-5 year stay(for now), and would like to continue traveling at that point. As both hospitals are in extremely small, isolated communities, there isn't really a lot to do, so I am mostly looking to just bank a bunch of cash before I continue my traveling career! The only reason I am considering taking a permanent position is because of the ease of both jobs (super low stress!) and because I never expected to be offered this much money as a tech. 

To put it in perspective, before I started traveling I was making $24/hour at a shitty hospital working the graveyard shift. It was extremely busy, I had terrible coworkers, and I was being treated horribly. The average med tech nationally makes between $18-$30/hour based on experience and location.

So really any of these options is a win! I really would appreciate advice, input, etc.",finance,1424547524

personalfinance,PSA: (US) Auto Insurance and the cost of the monthly payment options. Don't be like me!,"I just got through redoing my car insurance.  As part of that redo, the car insurance company offered me the option to purchase the insurance on a monthly or a six-month basis.  I thought to myself: *Hmm, monthly budgeting will be a lot easier and that's how I've been doing it, but let's see what the costs are.*

Monthly Payments: $75.85.  Total is $455.
Lump Sum: $411.

Now you might say: *That's a 10% interest rate.*  You'd be wrong, because you're making payments for only a six month period.  

20%?  No, because you're making payments every month.

The interest rate if you want to breakout Excel and it's handy-dandy XIRR function?

**66%.  Yep.  66%.**

I've been paying it that way for seven years because when I started with car insurance I had no idea how to calculate time value of money and even if I had, where was I going to get the several hundred dollars to pay in lump?  

Don't be like me, be smart.  Pay it in lump if you can or pay it with something that at least charges less interest than 66%.

TL;DR - If you want to pay for auto insurance on a monthly basis, it might be cheaper to just put the balance on your credit card and do it that way.",finance,1424549674

personalfinance,Debt disappeared?,"Hello PF! I'm in the process of trying to get my financial house in order and was hoping someone could shed some light on something.

I left a university I last attended a few years ago with a significant unpaid balance (a semester's worth of tuition after my federal student loan contribution). This was *not* a loan but an unpaid balance. The balance was eventually sent to collections and I received a number of letters and phone calls attempting to collect the debt. I have to go through some old files but I'm almost positive this was reflected on previous credit reports. 

Over time, the calls became increasingly intermittent and as of the last six months and possibly up to a year, I haven't received one letter or phone call from the collection agency about the debt.

Today, I checked my credit report only to find that the debt wasn't there. I've been making plans to pay off any debts I have and get my finances in order, and part of that plan was to tackle this unpaid balance. But as far as I can tell...it's gone. 

I've thought about reaching out to the debt collection agency or the university to inquire about paying off the debt but would it be wise to do so if the debt's not reflected on my credit report?

news,Cannabis Proves Effective In Treating Crohn’s Disease According To New Study,"A new clinical study published in the journal Pharmacology and by the National Institute of Health has found that cannabis is effective in treating Crohn’s disease, which is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBDs such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s affect over a million people in the United States. Many IBD victims suffer from pain, diarrhea and poor ability to digest food, and up to half of IBD cases are so severe that they ultimately require surgery to remove the affected bowel segment.

The study, entitled: “Cannabis Finds Its Way into Treatment of Crohn’s Disease” (International Journal of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Vol. 93, No. 1-2, 2013 Dec 17;93(1-2):1-3. [epublished ahead of print] © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.
PMID: 24356243) is co-authored by Rudolf Schicho, PhD and M. Storr, both of the Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Graz in Graz, Austria.

In the study abstract, Schicho and Storr note that In ancient medicine, cannabis was widely used to treat and cure bowel disturbances and inflammation, and a recent clinical study now shows that the medicinal herb Cannabis sativa lived up to expectations and proved to be highly efficient in cases of inflammatory bowel diseases.

The researchers report that a prospective placebo-controlled study has confirmed what was largely anticipated from anecdotal reports, i.e. that cannabis produces significant clinical benefits in patients with Crohn’s disease. They note that mechanisms involved are not yet clear, but most likely include peripheral actions on cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, and may also include central actions.



The Crohn’s Forum notes that the body produces substances called Endocannabinoids or Endogenous Cannabinoids, which function in a similar manner to Cannabinoids found in medicinal marijuana. Cannabinoids (CBs), either produced within the body or taken from an external source (ie: Pharmaceutical or Medicinal Marijuana), exert effects that may be of benefit to patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and certain types of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), including Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Medicinal Marijuana affects Cannabinoid Receptors (CB) in the Gastrointestinal Tract and can exert effects that help relieve symptoms. These effects include a reduction of: Pain, Inflammation, Diarrhea, Gastrointestinal Hypermotility and Secretion. Cannabis can reduce painful Gastrointestinal cramping as it is a smooth muscle relaxant, and can relax the Intestinal spasms. Cannabinoids can also increase healing of injured Epithelial Tissues. Many of these effects are due to Cannabinoid stimulation of Cannabinoid Receptors (CB) located in many parts of the body.
The human body produces and utilizes its own cannabinoids, but can also utilize cannabinoids from external sources such as cannabis. In their paper, Schicho and Storr observe that over the past decade there has been a steady increase in the number of publications addressing the anti-inflammatory effects of Cannabinoids and potential underlying mechanisms, and in particular that preclinical data on the ameliorating effect of synthetic and natural CBs in animal models mimicking features of IBD have been rapidly evolving. They cite a prospective placebo-controlled study by T. Naftali et al. (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2013;11:1276-1280.
External Resources) on the effect of cannabis in IBD than confirms what had been suggested for a long time from experimental studies, to wit that Cannabinoids may provide anti-inflammatory effects and symptomatic benefit in patients with IBD.

The Austrian researchers note that CB1 and CB2 receptors are located at the colonic epithelium, making a protective effect of the cannabinoid Delta-9-TetraHydroCannabinol (THC) via epithelial permeability is conceivable, in which case CBs could enhance epithelial wound closure in the colon.

They also note that other studies have demonstrated that a prominent characteristic of CBs in experimental intestinal inflammation is their effect on immunocytes which mainly express CB2 receptors. Upon CB2 activation, T cells undergo apoptosis and decreased proliferation in colitis, and additionally, activation of CB2 diminishes the recruitment of neutrophils, T cells and macrophages to the inflamed colon. CB receptors are also found in the enteric nervous system (ENS), that controls gut motility and secretion. CB1 receptors present in the ENS represent a break that protects the ENS from hyperstimulation, which is easily caused by overexpression of inflammatory mediators that activate the ENS during IBD. Consequently, they deduce that activation of CB receptors by THC may reduce hypermotility associated with the inflammation of the gut, and that reduction of hypermotility may alleviate diarrhea, producing beneficial effects for the patient.

The Crohn’s Forum reports that signaling through CB1 also has potent effects that may be beneficial to persons with IBD, including: reduction of Nausea/Vomiting, inhibition of Intestinal Motility, and anti-Inflammatory effects. They note that pharmaceutical companies are attempting to design medications that increase signaling through CB1, and which could potentially offer effective treatment for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) including Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. CB1 is present in the Brain and is responsible for the Psychological and Behavioral effects seen with use of Medicinal Marijuana. In order to be an effective treatment and minimize psychological effects seen with Medical Marijuana use, the pharmaceutical should be specific for CB1 and not cross the Blood Brain Barrier.

Moreover, CB1 appears to protect against severe Colitis. The Forum cites studies in mice that have CB1 blocked or do not have CB1 (CB1 knockout mice) which develop more severe experimental colitis symptoms than wild type mice. In animal models of Colitis, pretreatment with CB1 agonists (chemicals that activate the Receptor) leads to reduced chemical-induced Inflammation and Edema than animals not given pretreatment medication.

They note that the herb Cannabis sativa contains many more chemicals that may be relevant to disease treatment benefit than marijuana’s commonly known active compounds, THC and CBD, observing that it has been estimated that THC accounts for only one-third of medicinal marijuana’s effects, and that, chemicals found in Cannabis sativa extracts may either enhance the Inhibit the therapeutic effects of THC.

In an article originally appearing in Alternet, republished by Salon, Paul Armentano notes studies revealing that marijuana contains more than 60 active compounds likely possessing distinctive therapeutic properties, including anti-cancer properties, anti-diabetic properties, neuroprotection, and anti-stroke properties of cannabinoids other than tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis, which itself has valuable therapeutic effects.

Of course, a major obstacle and inhibiting factor to more widespread deployment of Cannabis in fighting diseases like IBS is that marijuana, including medical marijuana, remains illegal in in most US states at the federal level in the USA as well as in various countries around the world. However, in 2012 Washington and Colorado passed ballot initiatives legalizing marijuana for both recreational and medical, and currently 20 states and DC have enacted laws to legalize medical marijuana, but Texas is not among them.

In a conference at Houston in November, 2009, the American Medical Association’s House of Delegates adopted a new policy position calling for review of marijuana’s status as a Schedule I drug in the federal Controlled Substances Act’. The old language in Policy H-95.952 had previously recommended that “marijuana be retained in Schedule I,” which groups marijuana with drugs such as heroin, LSD and PCP that are deemed to have no accepted medical uses and to be unsafe for use even under medical supervision.

The AMA’s revised policy states: “Our AMA urges that marijuana’s status as a federal Schedule I controlled substance be reviewed with the goal of facilitating the conduct of clinical research and development of cannabinoid-based medicines, and alternate delivery methods.” Drugs listed in Schedule II, for which medical use is permitted with strict controls, include cocaine, morphine and methamphetamine. A pill containing THC, the component responsible for marijuana’s “high,” is classed in Schedule III, whose looser requirements allow phoned-in prescriptions.

The wheels turn slowly where cannabis is concerned. However, a poll commissioned by the Marijuana Policy Project in Texas shows that a strong majority of voters in the state support taking marijuana off the criminal market, legalizing it for adults, and taxing and regulating it similarly to alcohol. According to the poll, 58% of voters support making this change, while only 38% were opposed. The Texas Democratic Party made decriminalization of marijuana part of its official platform last year, and KHOU Houston reports that two Texas lawmakers have vowed to re-introduce marijuana legislation as many times as it takes to move the state closer to Colorado and Washington state-style pot regulations.

personalfinance,Aggressive Student Loan Payoff Strategy,"tl;dr - taking ~43% of my after-tax income over the next 12 months to pay off $30K in federal student loan debt.

Hi All,

I wanted to post the strategy I'm planning to implement over the next year in order to pay down $32,341.05 in federal graduate school student loans as quickly as possible. I'm 25 and graduated in August, so my loan deferment period ends next month and I'm required to begin paying. Luckily, I'm gainfully employed and will be able to pay much more than the minimum monthly payment. 

1. FedLoan 1 - $10,460.11 - 6.16% interest
2. FedLoan 2 - $10,704.77 - 5.16% interest
3. FedLoan 3 - $11,286.17 - 5.16% interest

Total Loans: *$32,451.05*

Currently I'm a 1099 contractor on salary for $96,000 per year, or $8,000 per month. Based on this salary, I set aside $2,000 per month for estimated taxes, leaving me $6,000 monthly after taxes.

My bills are as follows:  
* Rent - $1155  
* Cable/Internet - $110  
* Gym - $40  
* Power - $35  
* Renter's Insurance - $10  

Total Bills: *$1,350.00* per month (I'm planning to move in June and my total bills should drop to roughly $750.00 per month. This is being taken into consideration).

Obviously I'll need money to eat and live on, so I set myself a very reasonable budget of $500 per week, or $2,000 per month. This will be for anything that needs to be paid for (food, clothes, travel, gas, anything). I walk to work and can walk home to eat for lunch, but I eat out for lunch a couple times per week. Dinner is usually cooked at home during the week, but I dine out on the weekends. 

This gives:

$8,000 (Monthly take home) -$2,000 (Taxes) =$6,000 (After taxes)

$6,000 (After taxes) -$1,350 (Bills) =$4,650 (After bills)

$4,650 (After bills) - $2,000 (Monthly allowance) = $2,650 (remaining)

So we can see how 2015 pans out:



Month | Liquid Cash for Loan Payoff | Month Ending Loan Balance
-----|---------------|---------------
March | $2,650 | FedLoan1 - $7,810.11
April | $2,650 | FedLoan1 - $5,160.11
May | $2,650 | FedLoan1 - $2,510.11
June | $3,050 | FedLoan1 - Paid Off / FedLoan2 - $10,164.88
July | $3,250 | FedLoan2 - $6,914.88
August | $3,250 | FedLoan2 - $3,664.88
September | $3,250 | FedLoan2 - $414.88
October | $3,250 | FedLoan2 - Paid Off / FedLoan3 - $8,451.05
November | $3,250 | FedLoan3 - $5,201.05
December | $3,250 | $1,951.05
January '16 | $3,250 | FedLoan 3 - Paid Off
 
Ideally this gives me a January 15th, 2016 pay-off date for my loans, which would be a huge accomplishment for me (then comes saving for a house..).

My biggest problem with spending money is shopping on Amazon and frivolously spending money at bars/concerts when out drinking. I'm working to reign these habits in, as they only seem to have gotten worse the more money I bring home. I'm hoping that setting a budget with a well-defined goal will help, as this is the first time I've set a stringent budget (even though it's not strict in comparison to a lot of penny pinchers on here). My thoughts are that since I'm ""paying off"" instead of ""setting away"" money in a savings account that I'll get into the habit of considering my paychecks as already set aside, and not for spending.

Sorry for the long read! I appreciate any advice, thoughts, concerns, or additional considerations I should be taking. Please let me know anything I could be doing better/differently. 

Disclaimer: I know that the interest will cause the loans to fluctuate and change the calculations, but it shouldn't be too significant in just one year. Also, I know there isn't noted additional savings (emergency, IRA, or otherwise) on here. I already have a 3 month emergency fund, and due to my family financial situation it isn't imperative that I'm contributing to a retirement fund (I have a small one from a previous company, but I'm just trying to kill these student loans).",finance,1424589582

We are looking to tackle our debt with this cash out refinance.  We have about 40K in debt if you include everything (cars, student loans, cc etc).  A little bit of an outline. 

CC1 - $7K @ 12%
CC2 - 2K @ 20% (first credit card from college - just put a trip on this card (5% cash back for traveling), will be paying off before interest hits)
CC3 - 3K @ 8%
CC4 - 1.5K @12%
Car Loan - 8K @ 5%
Line of credit - 16K @ 8%
Student Loan - 4K @ 4%

plan is to pay off CC1,2,4 entirely = 10.5K
6.5K towards line of credit, 9.5K remaining. 

We have a 4K tax return coming that we're going to split 50% towards savings account and line of credit leaving 7.5K left owed. 

I have a 2K bonus coming in March.  Taxed at 25% so preparing about 1500 more towards the line of credit putting up at ~ 6K left. 

After all of this our debt would look something like this:
CC1,2,4 all done. 
CC3 - $3,000 @8% (wife's cc - just got a job 1 day a week ($32/hr) wants to pay this herself)
Line of credit - $6,000 @8%
Car loan - $8,000 @5%
Student Loan - $4000 @4%
Savings account with ~ $2,000 (line of credit of about 20K remaining available to help with an available liquid cash cushion)

Am I missing anything obvious?  I know some people will have strong thoughts about cash out refi's but we plan on being in this house for 5+ more years and were able to drop our interest rate from 5.25 to flat 4%.  This strategy will allow some extra monthly income to apply towards debt and savings moving forward.

personalfinance,How should I finance my bills?,"I'm in a situation where I have a significant amount of money investments (i.e. stocks/mutual funds), but not much money in my bank account. I need to free up likely around $3,000, maybe more, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to do so. In my mind, I have about three options:

**Option 1:** I currently put $1,500 from my monthly pay into a 401K. I could go for two months without putting any money into my 401K.

**Option 2:** I could liquidate my investments (in my regular investment account, not my 401K/IRA).

**Option 3:** I could borrow from my investment accounts on margin at 1.62% (Interactive Brokers' rate).


I'm trying to figure out which options would have the lowest cost, including opportunity cost. Here's how I see it:

**Option 1:** Assume 8% annual return. So [withdraw amount] * [annual return] = $3,000 * 8% = $240

**Option 2:** Assume 10% annual return (more flexibility with personal investment account instead of 401K means I've created a higher risk/higher return portfolio), assume I would realize gains of 50% of my original investment and would be taxed at 25%. I would have to pay tax on the 100% gain once I withdraw anyway, but the difference is that, by withdrawing now, I'll miss out on the gains on what I would have paid in tax. So, that means [withdraw amount] * [annual return] * [1-tax rate] + [realized gain] * [tax rate] * [annual return] * [1-tax rate]= $3,000 * 10% * 75% + $1,500 * 25% * 10% * 75% = $253.13

**Option 3:** I was a finance major, and I'm well aware of the risks that using margin carries. I'm already using some in my portfolio, but I don't think I'm over-leveraged. So for this example, please ignore the risk variable. [Interest rate] * [withdraw amount] = 1.62% * $3,000 = $48.60.

With this analysis, it seems that using margin is the clear winner (looking at the risk variable aside). Does my methodology makes sense? Is there anything else I've left out?",finance,1424621960
personalfinance,What do you think of my situation?,"Hi PF! Thank you all for all the advice I've seen on here.

I'm 29 years old, am an IT guy and here is my current situation:

**Income:**

* Salary: Paid twice monthly and my take home is $2,075 per check.
* Expense Reimbursement: $200-$400 per month
* Bonus: $1,500 - $5,000 once every three months.

**Fixed Expenses:**

* Mortgage: $1,516 FHA loan with escrow.
* Auto Insurance: $173
* Nicor/Gas: ~$60
* ComEd/Electric: ~$60
* HOA: $265
* Car: $268
* Internet: $52
* Alarm: $53 
* Car Washes: $80

**Debt:**

* Mortgage: ~$188,000 3.875% interest rate with $212/month PMI
* Car: ~$8,500 9.25% interest rate and 51 months left.
* AMEX: ~$44
* Discover: ~$12
* Chase Sapphire: ~$1,150
* Chase Freedom: ~$131

* HSA: ~$150
* Bitcoins: ~$5,000

**Variable Expenses:**

* Food, Cigs, Fuel, Drinks, Eating out and Misc: $1,000-$2,500

**Details:**
Last month I created a budget using Google Sheets and am determined to make 2015 the year of my finances and would like your input on how I am doing. 

**Income:** My W2 last year showed income of $93.5K. I'm expecting a small raise this Friday during my yearly review. My next bonus is in May and so far I am expecting at least $1,700, but depending on how Feb and Mar go it might be double that. Expense reimbursement is depended on how many miles I drive and highway tolls I pay each month. Since my schedule is variable week to week, it's hard to know an exact reimbursement amount.

**Fixed Expenses:**
First thing that jumps out at me is the Alarm and Car Washes. I know I could eliminate both of those, but I really like knowing that my home is safe when I'm not there and absolutely love a clean car since I'm in it so much every week. I drive around 100-200 miles per week.

**Debt:**
I'm currently talking with a lender on doing a refi on the FHA loan since the PMI rates have been lowered, I'd be looking at about $100 lower payment on the mortgage every month. As well as the interest rate would drop to 3.75%. The mortgage breakdown is: 

* P&amp;I: $909.59
* Homeowner's Insurance: $61.23
* MIP Mortgage Insurance:	$212.12
* County Tax: $335.15
* Overage: -$1.40

I pay all my CCs every month, I do this to repair my credit a bit, since when I was 18-20 I was given around $20K in CC limits and used it all to just have fun. Since then I've settled all of these, paid them off and have been charging my CCs and paying them off every month. Whatever I have left over every month is going to paying the car loan off. This month I sent an extra $3K, but this was a bit different as I got a bunch of money from family for my birthday. Most months I'm sending about $600 extra to the car loan. I recently got the Discover card with a $12K limit and they sent me a couple of checks I can use to transfer balances. I'm thinking about using one of those checks to pay off the Car loan. The balance transfer is interest free until April 2016 and there is a one time fee of 3%. 

I used Turbo Tax to quickly see what my tax liability is for last year and it came out to being around $1,400. I'm going to be printing that out and taking it to an accountant my family has been using for about a decade.

**Assets:**

I'm putting in $400 every month into Vanguard and my firm matches 3% of my salary.

I bought all my bitcoins when they were around $90-$110 each in the summer of 2013, so I'm still ahead on those, but it looks like every week/day those drop in value. I'm okay with holding them for the next 10 years to see what happens. I usually forget about them even being available to me to use whenever I want to buy something. 

My HSA is almost depleted as I've been to the dentist a bunch this year. I read somewhere that I can make additional deposits into it up until April of this year... I asked my employer/HR about this and they said no... Which is it?

**Variable Expenses:**
I usually transfer $1,000 from Checking 1 to Checking 2 since Checking 2 has no fee ATM withdrawals and I use it to see how I'm doing on my monthly spending. The reason I put a range down of $1K-$2.5K is because of the CC's I pay the CC's out of Checking 1 account. January's CC expenses were unusually high as I decided to start renewing my IT certifications as well as did some work on my home.

My father is quite wealthy and at age 58, he has a couple of million dollars stored away in cash. I am about to start a job in New York where I'll get paid ~$180,000 a year. I'm extremely lucky. My post taxes salary comes to about $85,000 a year.

Instead of moving to the city and paying rent, we are thinking about buying a condo or co-op for about $1.5 million dollars where my dad puts down around $1 million cash up front, we borrow 500k in a mortgage, and then I pay the mortgage off over 30 years at a 4% interest rate (or 15 years if its financially feasible). All the buildings we are looking at run about $2000-3000 dollars a month in maintenance fees. We are hoping to get a 2 bedroom apartment and rent out one of the rooms to cover the maintenance fees. That would leave me paying the mortgage at a rate of $3500 (max) a month. Basically, my dad puts down the initial investment. I cover the mortgage. And a renter covers the monthly fees. Ideally, this would leave me with a fully paid off apartment in New York by the time I'm 40 (if its not unreasonable to pay off the mortgage in 15 years).

I have no loans and I know this job will guarantee me at least as much money as I'm making for the next 4 years. After that I plan to transition to another job, but one that will keep me in the mid $150,000 range.

personalfinance,Terrified of being house poor,"I am more or less in good shape financially, and recently I've been thinking about buying a house in the near future. I have been renting for years and I am very risk averse, so I'm pretty worried about the unforeseen costs of owning a home and that getting me in trouble. Managing all the costs and budgeting for the unforeseen is overwhelming me a bit. What's a reasonable price range to look in to not have to stress over finances and be able to continue saving for retirement and perhaps a housing upgrade in the future? Or maybe renting would be a better idea still? Here is some of my info:

-29 years old

-$105k salary gross, up to $126.5k with bonuses with some potential side income which would be hard to predict. Right now I budget on the 105k. I haven't worked long enough to get the bonuses yet, those would come around August. This year I am very likely to make the full amount but it is not guaranteed in the future.

-Rent is currently $1200/month (there are limited options here for quality renting as it's a college town, which also drives up the price a bit... part of the reason I am looking to stop renting). Water and gas/heat is included.
 
-I have a ~240/month car payment, owe about $6,800. No other debt. The interest rate is about 2%. I have been paying $500-$750 a month.

-7% of my salary goes into a state pension and I max out an IRA every year (2015 being my 3rd year of having the IRA) 

-I currently save about $1200 a month in my ""down payment"" account. I have just over $25k saved, which would be at $34k by the time my current lease is up and I get my tax refund. I usually still have some money at the end of the month on my budget, maybe around $500 that I leave in my checking.

-Emergency fund is currently $4500, which would get me through 3 months rent right now. Of course, not having a mortgage, this is just semantics really.

-The key issue is that I will likely be supporting my girlfriend financially for a bit. I moved out here for work and she will be coming out upon her graduation. She has her own debts which are pretty significant, but I plan to help her out until she can find a job which may take a while. Being risk averse, I'd rather assume the worst that we will be single income but still have her debts (~$45k in federal student loans and a $150/month car payment with about $4k left). So that's probably the part that scares me most as it will likely be quite a bit of money. I'm estimating maybe $600/month minimum payments (based on not knowing the details). I have no qualms helping her out with the loans, I just want to factor it in. I'm sure there will be other expenses too (groceries, car insurance, electricity, etc.).

I didn't get a great start-- I got sick in my late teens, accrued lots of medical debt, and had to declare bankruptcy.  Other than that, my situation isn't too bad (I think.  Unless you all tear my financial situation to pieces :) )
  
I currently owe $46,600 (approx.) in student loans with an average interest rate of 6%.  I owe another $2,500 student loan with a 5.5% interest rate.  My salary is $41k a year, and I live in Los Angeles, where the cost of living is very high.  My net income is about $2,648 a month.  Here is my monthly budget:  
  
$1,100 for rent (I realize this is high, but LA is freakishly expensive.  This is what I've had to pay to have some things that are non-negotiable for me, i.e. no cockroaches and my own room).  
  
$225 for student loan with 6% interest (my payment doesn't even cover interest)  
  
$40 for loan with 5.5% interest  
  
$25 for internet  
  
$10 renter's insurance  
  
$70 for phone bill  
  
$80 for car insurance  
  
$~100 for all other utilities (it varies with usage, of course)  
    
Food and gas varies, but on a monthly basis I usually spend about $200 for food and $100 for gas.  
  
Total expenses: $1950  
  
So, personal finance experts, what should my strategy be? Should I get an IRA?  (My company offers a 401k but doesn't match the contributions, I am not enrolled it in at this point).  Should paying my debt be a priority?  Should I try to invest?

I consider myself a HARDCORE/ CASUAL GAMER. My hectic lifestyle gives me precious few hours to spend on a game. So when I heard the Order's length I knew I could finally sit and complete a game for the first time since I played Bioshock Infinite. I'm not here to focus on gameplay. Instead I'm here to find an experience to give me a few hours to escape the life of a full time father and replace it as a badass secret society knight.

As I played through The Order I found myself constantly engulfed in the story line and the atmosphere of world. The gameplay got in the way of my enjoyment a handful of times. But as a casual gamer I had no problem changing the gameplay to ""Easy"" and continuing my journey.

The story is for adults. This game is for adults. Very few young people will realize the burden that is placed on a father who must sacrifice his son. This is why The Order is not a hardcore gamers pick. This is a virtual movie that was maticulously rendered to take over the players senses.

personalfinance,I adjusted my W-4 exemptions from 4 to 0 last year and my tax bill is the highest it's ever been. Help! (X-Post from /r/tax),"I'm hoping somebody here can either point out a mistake I've made while doing our taxes or at least explain to me how this can happen.

When I was single I liked to keep my federal withholding exemptions high to keep more of my money each paycheck. I used this money to save and invest all year, knowing I would be getting a big tax bill. I am used to owing ~3k each year.

I've been married for 6 years now and my wife has never liked this ""strategy"" of mine. I've earned more money over the years and never adjusted my federal exemptions but my wife has always left her W-4 at 0. Between me paying too little, her paying too much and the various tax benefits of being married and having a mortgage we've maintained a tax bill right around the ~3k mark for the last 6 years.

This year I finally relented and adjusted my W-4 down to 0. In all honesty we haven't been as diligent together in doing wise things with the extra money I keep on my paycheck each month by having several federal exemptions as I was able to do when I single for the last couple of years, so I didn't mind letting the government force us to save a little more this year.

However, when I sat down to do our taxes yesterday I was shocked when TurboTax told me would owe nearly $5k. We had no major life changes in 2014. We own the same house we always have, we lived in the same (non income tax) state all year that we always have, our return on investments was what it generally is, etc.

For what it's worth, I made $97k in 2014 and my wife made $52k. That's a little more than I made last year but not drastically more. We each had our W-4 exemptions set to 0. We've always filed Married Filing Jointly.

I know I can reduce our tax bill a little still. I haven't entered a few charitable contributions we made last year yet, but I won't be able to get it below $4,500. We are fortunate to be in a situation where this is just a bummer and not a financial crisis for our family, but I really don't understand how this situation is even possible.

How can I have given the government more of our money each month than ever before and have a much higher tax bill than ever before, all other life situations being roughly equal?

My parents helped me a little, so i'd like to have 10-20K saved for each child to use at their discretion for appropriate expenses.  We are a single income household and plan to stay that way for 6-8 years.  

DEBT: 
I have a 15 year mortgage at 3.25%, 135K left on the mortgage...only 1 year into it but we put 20% down...so like 40K in equity currently.  
We have one car loan for out new (to us) baby hauler...a wagon with 50K miles from carmax.  Put 5K down to get a 3% rate and we have 10K left on it. 5 year loan, nearly a year into it.  
We have student loans combined total of about 10K$ at an effective blended rate of 3.19% among the 5 loans...we spend the last year paying off about 5K of my wife's loans that were at 6.8%...some loans are as low as 1.9%
I also usually carry a few hundred dollars on my credit card from month to month and should be better about making sure its a zero balance...but no major credit card debt.  
So..bottom line debt is 155K in the 3.25-3.5% range.  

Our major expenses are a 1300$ mortgage, 160$ car/home/prop insurance, 225$ utility, 100$ student loan, 50$ phone bill...i have a couple other odd and ends bills that total about 50$ (netflix, life ins. policy, burrito addiction).  We live pretty reasonably...no overseas vacations, no absurdly expensive hobbies...

We have approximately 50K$ in cash savings, and about 70K dollars split between my work retirement, company stock, and a private IRA.

I am starting to feel like we have to much liquid cash that isn't doing anything for us...feels silly to say ""we have to much cash"" but i also get a great deal of comfort knowing we are comfortably living and have cash reserves.  All of our interest rates are low...not free money...but not eating me alive...

Income: ~80k

Emergency Fund: 6 months

401K: 6% each paycheck plus half company match

Roth IRA: Contributing 100 dollars every month

Taxable Brokerage Account: Has $25k in it, have done quite well over the past 2 years (invested in Kroger about a year and a half ago) also trying to ""dollar value average"" with an index fund. I have far outperformed my student loan interest rate thus far. 

Student Loans: 27k, all at 6.5% interest, government owned. Only other debt is a car payment.

So here is my question:
Do I sell off all the assets in my taxable brokerage account and eliminate the student loan debt?  Or do I continue what I'm doing and divide my excess income each month between the student loans and the taxable account? There would be tax implications for selling off the assets, I don't have the exact number but I'd say my capital gains have been 6k or 7k. My income is too high to deduct the student loan interest on my taxes. Although my investing returns have far outperformed my 6.5% interest rate, my inclination is to sell and pay off the loans, I feel like I'm on top right now and it's the time to sell and that my luck will probably soon run out.

personalfinance,Was buying a $320k house a bad idea? Should I try to pay it faster?,"- I am 29 my wife is 28

- I make $84,000 a year. My wife makes about $60,000 and we put all of her salary into savings. Not a penny of my wife's salary do we use in our living expenses. We actually keep her money in a separate account to protect against this. We do use her money to max both of our roth IRA's respectively. I do the full 5% employer match to my 401k but nothing more.

- I have owned my house for 2 years and I am about to refinance to a a 29 year loan at lower interest rate 3.9% from 4.25. My lender offered me this refinance with 0 cost to me. 

- Other than my house, I have 0 debt. I own both my cars outright. I have no student loans.

- My mortgage runs me about $1,700 a month all in - includes taxes and insurance.

- I owe like $289,000 on my home right now. After my refinance it will be like $291,400 because of some escrow bullshit. Apparently my escrow will be paid out to me in cash, but my new loan amount will increase by that amount.

My Questions:

- Should I try to pay my home off faster with my wife's salary rather than save it? I have done plenty of loan amortization charts and I know it saves money, but i have got advice that her money would be better off in an investment account.

 - Californian

 - Single for well over a year now

 - Nowadays live a loner/hermit life that consists of work/gym/dog

 - 27 years old

 - Live with parents

 - Have an almost 2-year-old puppy

 - Working on a side project that I hope to turn into a business some day (or sell)


Financial details..

 - Current salary of ~$110k

 - Take home is ~5.5k/month

 - Gunning for promotion this summer and raise of around +20k

 - Credit scores of high 700s and/or low 800s (from reports over the past year)

 - Racked up a lot of debt in previous years from a failed startup that I've been randomly aggressively paying down

 - ~25k in liquid cash in my bank accounts

 - ~5k in certificates

 - ~50k in RSUs that will fully vest in 2 more years

 - New car loan of ~41k (pay 750 each month while minimum is 600); it was a ""treat yo'self"" buy that feeds one of my main hobbies (offroading); 2.29% interest

 - Credit card 1 that I pay in full each month; 10.65% interest &amp; 2.5k limit

 - Credit card 2 with a balance of 20k; 14.99% interest &amp; 40k limit

 - Paid off all student loan debt a year ago (college dropout after 5 years of wasting time)


I could easily flush that 2nd card to a balance of $0 and go to paying it in full each month while starting out with ~5k in liquid cash after the payment, but what do I really have to gain from that considering I only lose ~$200 a month in interest/chargers on that card and currently pay a static $1,000 toward it every month which has been slowly knocking it down.  It helps my credit score (other than the small utilization ding) by keeping up with consistent payments and I get to keep the liquid cash in my accounts.  I do plan on moving out of the house (prefer to buy) toward Q4 this year so continuing to save would of course be the better option for that (my range will require a down payment of at least 50k).


Should I just continue to do what I'm doing or flush the balance?

I can convert to a standard investment account, but may have to pay a penalty for early withdrawal of a ROTH.  Not sure about the penalty on the last one.
I've read about backdoor ROTH, and am interested in pursuing this option, but my concern is that since I contributed monthly last year, I'm not sure if that would make a difference.  Would I just convert this to a standard IRA, and then back to a ROTH the same day?

Full time job 401K is matched to 4% which I contribute to full 4%.  Roth IRA with ~16K that I do not actively contribute to.  Single 529 plan for my oldest that we put about $100/m towards.  Have yet to set up 529's for our twin 1.5 yr old girls (plan is next month or two)  We own our home - payment of 1600 including PMI.  We recently finished the basement, had the house re-appraised and are now about 60K+ in equity.  We finished our refinance last week and did cash out re-fi keeping 20% equity (no PMI) and will be picking up a check for 17K this coming week.  Monthly payment is now down to just under $1400.   We are looking to tackle our debt with this cash out refinance.  We have about 40K in debt if you include everything (cars, student loans, cc etc).  A little bit of an outline. 

CC1 - $7K @ 12%
CC2 - 2K @ 20% (first credit card from college - just put a trip on this card (5% cash back for traveling), will be paying off before interest hits)
CC3 - 3K @ 8%
CC4 - 1.5K @12%
Car Loan - 8K @ 5%
Line of credit - 16K @ 8%
Student Loan - 4K @ 4%

plan is to pay off CC1,2,4 entirely = 10.5K
6.5K towards line of credit, 9.5K remaining. 

We have a 4K tax return coming that we're going to split 50% towards savings account and line of credit leaving 7.5K left owed. 

I have a 2K bonus coming in March.  Taxed at 25% so preparing about 1500 more towards the line of credit putting up at ~ 6K left. 

After all of this our debt would look something like this:
CC1,2,4 all done. 
CC3 - $3,000 @8% (wife's cc - just got a job 1 day a week ($32/hr) wants to pay this herself)
Line of credit - $6,000 @8%
Car loan - $8,000 @5%
Student Loan - $4000 @4%
Savings account with ~ $2,000 (line of credit of about 20K remaining available to help with an available liquid cash cushion)

Am I missing anything obvious?  I know some people will have strong thoughts about cash out refi's but we plan on being in this house for 5+ more years and were able to drop our interest rate from 5.25 to flat 4%.  This strategy will allow some extra monthly income to apply towards debt and savings moving forward.

You can read more about my backstory and why I was considering permanently enrolling IBR [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2wecdj/at_what_point_should_you_just_give_up_paying_your/).

Anyway, after much thought, I agree with a lot of people that IBR/PAYE comes with too much risk, and my best bet is to increase my income and get rid of my student loan debt as soon as possible. Thus, I'm currently looking at several ways to increase income (e.g., second job on weekends) and also looking to refinance my loans. 

I luckily live in a low cost of living area and don't have a car payment. Thus, **I can afford about $1,000 per month towards student loans**.

If I consolidate my loans through the federal government, my interest rate would be 6.5% (after the automatic payment deduction). That means my payment would be $1006 a month and, making bi-weekly payments, that would take me 20.8 years to repay, and I'd pay $269,956 total over the life of the loan ($121,956 in interest).

However, Charter One's quote for my refinance has an interest rate of 5.19% (after automatic payment deduction). By my calculations, my payment would be $992 (I'd pay $500 biweekly), it would take me 17.5 years to repay, and I'd pay $225,152 over the life of the loan ($77,152 in interest).


Saving $44,000 in interest seems like a no-brainer, but I'm a little scared of losing the protections that federal loans provide if I refinance. To secure myself against the risk of losing these protections, I have an emergency fund that can take care of three months of cost of living and loan payments. Second, as a last resort, both of my parents are old enough to draw on their retirement accounts and agreed that they can help if shit hits the fan (this is an extreme last resort that I never want to use). 

Thus, I think I have a decent enough amount of support to go ahead and take the risk to refinance through a private bank. Any thoughts?

**TL;DR**

**Federal Loan Consolidation**: $148,000 at **6.5%** interest, would take 20.8 years to repay and cost $121,956 in interest.

**Private Refinance**: $148,000 at **5.19%** interest, would take 17.5 years to repay and would cost $77,152 in interest.

1. I believe the market is in pretty good shape and I am not worried about losing the GMAB protection, but should I diversify more than just with a bunch of different index funds?

2. I have been tempted to refinance my house to see if I can get a better interest rate and lower my mortgage payment.

personalfinance,Financing a Renovation: Cash vs. Equity Loan vs. HELOC,"Hello pf,

I'm looking to finance a moderate (~$25k) home renovation project and I'm not sure what my smartest option is.  While I have enough in savings (various mutual funds, non-tax exempt account) to cover the cost, but wouldn't it be more effective to take out a home equity loan or line of credit since the interest rate should be well less than the return on my investments? Even more so when I factor in tax (loan/LOC interest is tax deductible vs. withdrawing from savings would incur some capital gains).

Let's assume for the sake of discussion that I'm not going to run off and spend the money in savings on something else, and that I'll be staying in my home for &gt;10 years.  It seems like a no-brainer to me to borrow the money now and pay it back later with savings that will (hopefully) outpace the loan interest.

I understand this exposes me to some risk (what if the economy tanks again and I go underwater on the house and negative return on my savings?) but I think I'm okay with that. Am I being naive? Also, I know next to nothing about home equity loans or HELOCs--am I overlooking something?

My ""open"" utilization prior to this transfer (the BofA card is inactive and doesn't get counted apparently) was about 28% as I'm busy paying off another active card at the same time (lower interest rate so the BofA takes priority for BT), if that matters.

Edit: Went ahead and called Chase, because what's one more pull at this point? They increased the CL to 10k, enough to cover my BT. That makes this question moot since now I can move the whole 10k over with no fees at 0% for 15mos.",finance,1424736920
personalfinance,"Soon to be graduated, critique my PF plan?","Hello! I lurk in this sub an awful lot, have read the whole sidebar, and love reading everyone's thoughtful advice on a myriad of different personal finance issues. I've learned a lot from this sub and related ones. In the past (teenage years pretty much), I was shit with money and spent ridiculous amounts of it on partying, booze, clothes, etc. In the past year or two I wanted to get my shit together, and I'm in a more stable place now.  


So my question is am I doing things right? Here is my situation as it stands:  

* Soon to graduate college student, will have around $30,000 in federal loans when I graduate. I live just outside a major US city.   

* I am currently employed working part time, make ~16,000 per year, live on my own, parents help with health and car insurance thankfully so I am able to save. I pay my rent/utilities on time and in full.  

* After I graduate, based on my field and experience I'll be making ~45-60k to start.  

* As of now, I am working on an emergency fund with a goal of $5000 (~4 months expenses), I currently have ~2000 in there, and I add $300 per month to it.  

* After I reach my $5000 e fund goal (in ~10 mos.), the $300/month  will be redirected to student loans. I put all my loans and interest rates into a calculator and it told me that my min payment will be ~250/month. At this point I'll also reevaluate and probably increase the $300 to get rid of loans faster (also assuming that my income increases).  
 
* No credit card debt, I have an apple barclay card (bought a no interest macbook and paid off immediately). That card sits in my safe. I just applied for and was approved for an Amex bluecash everyday card which is on it's way in the mail. Was it smart for me to get this card? I realized that if used correctly, I'll just be earning rewards and have better consumer protection by using the CC for everyday things, rather than using my debit card linked to checking. I have a ~720 credit score. I already have it set up to autopay the full balance each month.  

* No other debts besides the student loans. I have a car bought with cash.  


So I know it's a little convoluted, but I want to get an idea if my financial situation is okay for now, at 22 years old. Is there anything I'm overlooking? I don't have a ton of assets right now but I want to have a handle on things once I'm done with school, since I know those loans ain't goin away. Is this a good general outlook for the next few years? Is there any obvious info I'm missing?

-attended college between 2005-2009, took out 4k in federal student loans

-paid loan off in full through brusar in 2009 right before graduation, kept receipt 

-run out of official copies of transcript in 2011, request new ones from college. Request denied. They say I am in default on my student loans (now $12k).
I was never notified. I received requests for alumni donations all this time, but they never notified me of any outstanding loan balance.


-show them receipt. They say they're sorry, but there's nothing they can do because it's in collections.

-I contact US Department of Education. They say that my debt was sold to a collection agency.

-I contact the collection agency and try to fight it. They basically tell me tough shit.

-2012 I try to pay the agency as I think I have no other option and don't want my credit destroyed. After three months, I realize that my payments are only going towards the interest, not the balance. They won't let me pay more because of the payment plan I was assigned due to my low income (it's hard getting a good job without transcripts), but I don't have it anyway. Debt is now a staggering 25k for some baffling reason. I stop paying. I give up on the dream of good credit or being allowed to return to education.

-2013-2014 I receive letters from many different debt collectors, all saying I owe different amounts on my loan (13k-28k). My credit report says I owe 22k.

-2015 creditors have been quiet for months and I have a 5k tax refund coming. We plan to use it to have a wedding, get a used car and buy new clothes for our kids. We've finally caught a break.

-today: notified by mail that my refund has been garnished in its entirety to pay the US Department of Education, who had previously told me that they sold the loan and that I couldn't pay them directly for it. Wedding set for April. We're going to have to cancel. We're heartbroken.

I know we'll have to get an attorney. That alone will hit us hard because I had to stop working after some complications from giving birth (I plan to return to work soon). My fiance is disabled and we have five children between us. Things are tight but doable- but not if they keep going after us.

Back in August I received a call from a blocked number while I was at work. I've been, for the past year, trying to clean up my credit and take care of debts, as I had just finally landed a full time job after a career change. The person on the phone told me that I owed a debt to Chase for a credit card from when I was younger. I was told I was about to be sued, and that unless I forked over a certain amount to take care of the debt, I would in fact be sued. I asked if there was absolutely anything I could do and was put on hold for what seemed like an hour. 

When the person came back they told me I was lucky. I could go on a payment plan, and would avoid the lawsuit. I agreed, and they took a payment, and signed me up for automatic withdrawls.  

Two months later I recieved a phone call saying they had issues taking a payment. I confirmed my card info, and they said they'd be able to put it through. However the payments to them stopped. I tried for a few weeks to get ahold of someone at the company, with no success on getting a call back. I became nervous that perhaps it was all a scam, but no more payments came out, so I let it go and moved on.

Fast forward to today. I recieved a call, blocked number. This person left a message, no details, just a name and a number and to call him back.  I called, and was given the same run down I was given at the beginning. I owed a debt and I was on the verge of being sued. they told me it was too late to do a payment plan, so they needed 1600 to pay it off.  I explained I had already agreed to a payment plan, that the payments were given, and then they stopped pulling them.  He told me there was no record of this, and the arrangement ship has sailed. 

I asked for his companies process for verification of the debt, as I had learned through this sub, and the guy immediately turned on me.  He laughed and asked what that even was. He told me I'd have to get that from someone else, the credit card company, it wasn't his responsibility. I explained that since his company bought the debt, it was his company's responsibility, and he laughed again and told me ""good luck"". 

He hung up on me, and I immediately confirmed through bank statements I had started a payment plan. Since he acted like he had no idea what a verification of debt was, there was nothing more made of it. I'm not sure what to do now.  I had already agreed to a payment plan, they didn't continue it.  I also, since apparently they had no record of my agreement, asked to see proof, and they didn't fulfil that. I'm lost now.

finance,"Bally Price Holdings Management: Tax glitch to affect 800,000 ACA consumers","Federal authorities announced that a **[tax-reporting](http://news.bpholdingsmngt.de/category/tax-strategies/)** glitch might affect the filings and delay tax refunds of hundreds of thousands Americans.

Officials have confirmed that the administration has sent incorrect information to around 800,000 clients who bought health insurance in 2014, thus requiring them to update their tax return information. The people affected accounts for around 15% of the enrollees processed via healthcare . gov in 2014. They have already been notified of the mistake and requested to postpone their filing of returns by 3 weeks.

According to reports from **[Bally Price Holdings Management](http://news.bpholdingsmngt.de/)**, the root of the mistake was the accidental replacement of 2015 data with those of last year's. This technical error is expected to affect the key component of the healthcare law and slow tax refunds for people who need it most. 

The subsidies involved are an important part of the Obamacare or Affordable Care Act's scheme. The financial assistance permits even more Americans to purchase insurance as it is available to people who do not qualify for Medicaid. This balance is critical as there should be enough healthy enrollees to equal those who need medical assistance.

After a troubled launching year, healthcare.gov has appeared to be performing well in the past months until the major technical glitch last week. Republicans were quick to seize the chance to pounce on the administration's mistake after the latter claimed a successful enrolment season with 11.4 million new sign ups.

Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate's Finance Committee, said in his statement, ""Whether it's providing taxpayers with incorrect subsidy information or having to create special enrollment periods so that taxpayers can avoid costly penalties, Obamacare continue to frustrate and confuse Americans. The Administration's latest attempt to unilaterally tweak their own law to avoid political fallout once again underscores the failed policies rooted in Obamacare's DNA.""

Bally Price Holdings Management experts said that it's not clear yet if this recent snag will affect consumer behavior as some of them are already finding it hard to adapt to the complex system of subsidy.",finance,1424746270
personalfinance,Is not paying the only way to negotiate? 60k in student loan debt [x-posted /r/studentloans],"Hi there -

I will try and make this as concise as possible. So like some humans on earth, I have accrued a small fortune in student loan bills. I went to a public university for three semesters, where I failed out and withdrew - and then attended a makeup artist program. The total of these is roughly $60,000 in private and federal loan debt.

I have a federal loan that I have already negotiated down to affordable payments. The private loans are for my makeup education and were to cover the additional tuition to my college bill - as federal aid did not cover my entire college costs.

I am in the process of having my mother taken off as the cosigner on my Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) loan and then the payments will be transferred onto me.

The loan's interest rate is insane at 11.75% and I have a current principle of $22,291. The payments are roughly $456/month.

I make roughly 30k a year before taxes, part of this income is self employment. I can't afford these payments on top of my other bills and loan payments - and I have yet to find a place that will refinance them since I don’t have an eligible degree.

So, I want to negotiate with the company to lower the monthly payments by either lowering the interest rate, extending the loan's terms - or both. In the past, the company hasn't even listened when I've attempted to contact them, since my mother's income is high enough to afford the loan and she has never missed a payment.

I was advised by a financial counselor a few months ago, to contact the company a few times to negotiate, pay only what I could afford, and pretty much make the loan delinquent. If the loan company still didn’t work with me, I was to report them to this agency (http://www.consumerfinance.gov/) and at that point, I would likely get attention from a higher up by making a complaint.

Is this a tactic that works – and is there anyway to not kill your credit by becoming delinquent on your loans in order for private loan providers to negotiate? Is this a matter of luck? Or is this lady a crazy person? Am I a crazy person? (I know this is already yes)

Thank you in advance.",finance,1424746847

Bitcoin,Ironic? - Coinbase account closed for settling with the SEC over unlicensed virtual currency charges,"Well crap.  I really liked these guys too.

&gt; Apologies but our bank considers your account with us &gt; too much of a risk given the news about the SEC fine &gt; for unlicensed digital currency exchanges.

They're referring to my prior operation of the now closed BTC Trading Corp website, which never touched USD, and for which I settled with the SEC and paid a civil (not criminal) fine.

Not hypocritical at all given that they're currently operating an unlicensed digital currency exchange in our mutual state (California) ... and it's a federal criminal offense to run an MSB without proper state licensing in place.

I probably wouldn't be very upset, except that they let me sell my bitcoin, and now won't let me buy it back.  They let me place a buy order and after the funds have been missing from my account a week or so (during which bitcoin has appreciated $10) they decided they're going to not deliver the bitcoin and instead issue a refund.  So the path of fewer banking transactions would have been to just give me the BTC.  Instead they chose to unwind the transaction leaving me with a $10/coin loss.

I know lots of people recommend localbitcoins but it doesn't take many P2P transactions before the feds tag you as an MSB regardless of your intent.  Can't be too careful here in the land of the free.

personalfinance,Parent PLUS Advance Payments,"Some quick background information.  My mom took out a ParentPLUS loan for me when I attended school back in 08 and 09.  The loan amounts were worth 40k and 10k, both with interest rates at 8.5%.  Obviously with a PLUS loan, the entire thing is managed by the parent and the credit goes to the parent as well.  Ever since holding a steady job in 2010, I've been giving my mom the majority of my income to go and pay off the debt.  In 2014 alone, I gave her 20k for that purpose.  The previous year was about the same, and only about 10k the years prior.  Since she has managed the account, I've never really had the chance to see how it was being managed, but every time I asked, I was extremely disappointed by how much I still owed.  Well this year she finally gave me the actual report from the loan provider.  The excess money I've given her has gone as future payments instead of applying to the principle amounts.  Now it's no wonder why the amount owed hasn't gone down much.  But the money I've thrown at it seems like completely wasted money now.

Is there any way I (or my mom) can reverse these payments so that the excess amount applied to the loan goes to the principle, rather than future payments?  Or have I lost a ton of money in this case?

Any other advice for my current situation?  I can provide the exact numbers if needed.  The loan amounts are somewhere near 31.6k and 8.2k remaining on each respectively according to the report.  I have another 10k I was planning on giving her within the next month, but I want to make sure things get fixed first.

I'm not blaming anything, except my ignorance for this current situation.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

personalfinance,Critiques about my saving strategy,"I would like input on my current saving strategy. I am 28 and I use to live check by check and have little in savings. The first part 2014 I went through a lot of emotional turmoil. It made me realign my goals in life and made me think about my financial future.

&amp;nbsp;

I realized I can not just pay off existing debt then start saving. I need compartmentalization my finances to actually save money. Granted I can make more money in one account with a high interest rate vs having multiple accounts with varying interest rates. For me earning ~0.5% on ~$10,000 with multiple accounts is better than earning 0.9% on $1,500. I tried to change my habits to maximize interest/benefit, but I always tend to spend my money if it is too easily accessible. 

&amp;nbsp;

Currently I have 4 savings accounts, 2 checking accounts, and one investment account.

&amp;nbsp;
**Local bank:**

* Personal Checking: ~$100
* Emergency Savings: $1,400 + 100/month @ 0.02% w/ $50 bank bonus/year with monthly deposit of +$50
* Maintenance Savings: $250 + 100/month @ 0.02% w/ $50 bank bonus/year with a monthly deposit of +$50
* Money Market Savings: $75 + $25/month @ 0.02% w/ .05% bonus/year

&amp;nbsp;
**Online banks:**

* Online Personal Savings: $7,200 + $900/month @ 0.9%
* Online checking (saving for personal purchases): $2100 + 50 to 300/month

&amp;nbsp;
**Investments**

* Online Trading Account: $7,300
*currently I do not have enough time to do research and go over financial statements to add any more money into my investment account, so I am on a temporary hold on purchasing new stock*

&amp;nbsp;

I automate my payments to my savings and money market accounts. I use my online checking as a savings account to save for purchases regarding my interest. i.e. bicycles/parts, technology, computer hardware, etc. This has helped me to not add more debt to my credit cards.

&amp;nbsp;

My current debt at the beginning of 2014 was roughly $16,000 and savings of $400. Currently I have $9,000 at 3% apy in student loans, and $1,900 at 14% APY. What I did was take care of all my smaller credit cards with lower balances at higher interest rates, and now I am chipping away at my two remaining accounts.

&amp;nbsp;

My goals for this year is to have a total in these accounts:

&amp;nbsp;
**Local Bank**

* Emergency Savings: $3,000 ($1,600 to save)
* Maintenance Savings: $2,000 ($1,750 to save)

&amp;nbsp;
**Online Banks**

* Online Personal Savings: $10,000 ($2,800 to save)

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to reaching these goals I am going to try to max out an IRA account to reduce my tax liability for next year.

&amp;nbsp;

After I get those amounts in the above accounts I will shift my automatic savings to my personal savings to $300/month down from $900. Then focus on reducing my total debt to get it below $5,000 by the end of the year.

&amp;nbsp;

For 2016 I will try to finish reducing my debt to 0 before the middle of the year. Then open a mutual fund and/or opening a betterment.com account.

&amp;nbsp;

I know I could potentially save more money by focusing on debt right now, but a main milestone that I want to reach is having $10,000 in a single account. My overall goals are to save $10,000 in a single account, have a combined amount in my emergency and maintenance account of $5,000, then focus on zero debt, and then diversify by adding a mutual fund/betterment account. This last year I have been focusing on creating a base asset pool, and taking baby steps in promoting good financial habits. My 2015-2016 goal is zero debt and by 2017 I hope these baby steps to financial responsibility will be ingrained in me. When I looked back from 18 to 26 I just lived by pay check to pay check and accumulated a huge amount of debt.

&amp;nbsp;

If anyone has added advice please feel free to comment! I want to make sure my financial plan is as efficient for my current habits.",finance,1424766106

personalfinance,(UK) Looking to buy a new car - should I go PCP or HP,"I'm in need of a new car and have narrowed it down to a few different options. I've discussed finance with a couple of dealerships and they are all telling me that I should go with PCP over HP, however I'm not so sure.

The main car I'm looking at is about £9600 base price, however with a discount I can get, I can get it for closer to £8,500. The dealership is currently trying to sell me on PCP using the following numbers:

* £500 deposit
* £170/month for 42 months
* £2,500 (ish) final buyout value on the car - if I choose to buy it.
* 20,000 miles per year
 
My issue with this is that I don't want to spend £7,500 over 3 1/2 years to then not buy the car, but I also don't want to end up spending £10,000 on a car that I could have paid £8,600 to start with.

When I checked the number for HP, I was given:

* £500 deposit
* £250/month  for 36 months

I'm really unsure on which is the best way to go with this - I'm also interested to know if I might be better off going to the bank and taking out a loan, then paying in cash (should I decide to buy outright rather than PCP). Obviously, that will all require a conversation with the bank to discuss interest rates with them.

Anyway, my basic question is: am I missing something with the whole PCP vs HP thing, and which would you suggest going for?",finance,1424777680

What is Forex Trading?
Forex Trading is something we have all probably heard about at some point – perhaps through an advert in the Financial Times or a money magazine of some sort; but do you actually know what it means? Forex trading is the trading of foreign currency (hence the name foreign exchange). Essentially, you buy one currency with another – the idea being using the fluctuating currency conversion rates to your advantage.

Success Story – The Accidental Pay Day
I have a great personal example of how you can make some serious money on the Forex markets. My uncle and his family live in the US after he emigrated over 20 years ago. After leaving the UK, he sold his property and left a large sum of money in a UK bank account. He owns a project management type business and a few years back had to transfer a large sum of money as collateral for an insurance bond – essentially he had to use the nest egg as a guarantee against the insurance policy for a job. He transferred the money from GBP (British Pounds Sterling) to USD (US Dollar) at a rate of approximately $2 for every £1. £80,000 of savings became equivalent to $160,000.
Now he kept this money in the bond to guarantee the insurance for about nine months and transferred the cash back to his UK account shortly after. He thought nothing of this for about a year, until he received his annual interest statement for the UK bank account. Can you imagine the shock (and delight) upon finding out that £80,000 was now over £100,000!? Now I can assure you that the bank didn’t decide to pay him 25% interest, but instead the foreign exchange markets had changed significantly: £1 to $2 had become £1 to $1.50. A case of trading the money at the right time – Had it been the other way around, he would have made a significant loss!
 
Who is Forex Trading For?
The simple answer is everyone! Anyone is able to trade in foreign exchange, but those who have interests and investments in multiple countries had a slight advantage as they can trade between bank accounts. For example, if I have investments in the US (or at least in dollars) and in the UK, I could benefit from having assets in both currencies and move funds when the markets are advantageous to your positions, but there can be significant fees associated with this technique. Others will use Forex trading platforms to convert money between different currencies with the intent purely to make money – i.e. there is no practical reason (like to invest in a property) for converting from one currency to the other.
 
Like anything else, Forex Trading has a level of risk associated with it. There are many resources online where you can learn about the principles of Forex and trading within the market. I highly recommend that you do some reading and research before jumping in – You can lose money as well as gain through trading currencies. That said, if you are totally risk adverse, maybe the low-interest savings accounts are a better option. You have to be prepared to lose some (if not all) of your investment or play. Similar to the stocks and shares, some currencies are more stable than others – politically unstable currencies are far more likely to fluctuate than the US dollar.

personalfinance,Calculator for the effect of not holding mortgages to term,"Most of the principal is paid off at the tail end of a mortgage. This fact is well known, but I was interested in finding some way to quantify it. It's not uncommon for people to sell their house *before* they pay it off and I may end up doing the same in the future, so it was worth looking into for me.

Link goes to the spreadsheet I put together: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPqUb6vOdIbmSMTOfZ7HfC5bfUB3_Q6O0imP15iLmSw/edit#gid=0

The numbers are surprising. If one is in the habit of buying a house with a 30 year mortgage, living in it for 10-15 years, then moving onto the next one, they are effectively paying an interest rate on their principal used of well over 10%! Most people would turn down a 10-30+% loan--even if it's short term--and for good reason.

One might counter, ""but doesn't the next mortgage carry over from the previous mortgage so this is moot?"" Well, it takes the *principal* you've paid off, yes, but otherwise for all intents and purposes you have started over.

Some other considerations: there is a mortgage deduction on your taxes that affects interest rate calculation, however a lot of people in small-medium priced houses are better off using the standard deduction. You get to live in a better house. Home price may appreciate, effectively giving you more principal. And finally, buying is still (in many cases) better than renting.

To me, though, there's one clear takeaway: you're much better off sticking with a mortgage until the bitter end.",finance,1424801006

When I brought this up with my parents, they were absolutely against it and threw a bit of a fit, saying that I'm already in the teacher retirement system and that choosing a local bank is wiser for savings, as anywhere like the before mentioned is only for people with a huge sum of money to save who like risk.  They also told me that I shouldn't be putting any of my money into retirement, instead focusing all of it into graduate school so I don't have to take out as many loans later.  After they told me that, I'm left feeling kind of stumped.  The local banks have laughable interest rates, and I want something on top of whatever retirement system my job has.  I'm 21 so the thought of how large my retirement account could get is pretty beautiful sounding.  My parents are letting me live with them and paid for my college, so I want to respect their opinions.  I just don't think they're right.  PF, could you point me into the right decision in what I should be doing?  I know I'm not required to listen to them (and don't often because I'm stubborn), so a lecture on that isn't quite necessary.  I honestly just don't know what is wise.",finance,1424802881
personalfinance,New to budgeting - basic budget sheet,"Hello all. I came upon this thread last week and it has been very inspiring to me. I am in the accounting field so you may think that budgeting comes super easy. This isn't the case. Making the budget was easy. My biggest issue is the will power to continue sticking to and updating my budget.

I wanted to share the simple budget that I created. I am looking for some advice for areas of weakness. Maybe there are some things I am over budgeting and I don't recognize.

One hard part for me is that I get paid from my full time job once a month, on the last business day. My part time job (8 hours a week) is paid every two weeks. I also receive a mileage check each month, but the amount greatly varies.

I am trying to put 20% away into savings each month. I know the importance of the 3-6 month emergency fund, but I am getting married in May 2016 and I don't know how much (possibly all) of the wedding my fiance and I will be paying for. This budget is just my side of the finances. Right now I am putting all of my savings, 1200 current and about 20% net income per month into a money market account that is yielding 1%. Nothing great, but better than 0% is my thought process. I plan to use these savings in the event of an emergency, but then possibly deplete it fully for the wedding in May of 2016.

I plan to lower the savings to 15% in August because I will be moving into a new apartment at a higher rent. We will not have as many roommates then.

I am trying to follow what I have heard from the YNAB crowd of assigning every dollar a job. I have about $40 budgeted as not assigned right now. Should I leave this or fix it?

Also is YNAB worth the price of admission if I am already using a budget like this?

Also, my job has a pension plan and is automatically funded from my paycheck. I do not have any additional retirement savings accounts.

I have no Credit Card debt. Anything I put on a credit card is paid in that month or the next.

I have just over $60,000 in student loans and about $9,500 owed on my vehicle.

My student loan payments are high because they consist of 40K in private loans and 20K in federal loans. I got the private loans in 2006 as a 17/18 year old with no knowledge of federal vs private anything.

I feel like I am not in a terrible position since I can put 20% of my income to savings, however, one of my concerns is if I am doing it right by saving the money for the wedding now or if I should stop saving for the wedding, only save for the emergency fund, and then pay down the student loans sooner once emergency fund is at 3 months.

This post has gotten a lot longer than I thought it would. Thanks for any help or advice you might be able to give.

Here is the budget I am using and the numbers I am using. If it isn't an atrocity and you want to use it as well, feel free.

personalfinance,Questions about my Personal situation...,"Looking for advice, I've recently started making enough where I can re-think living paycheck to paycheck and making minimum payments on my student and auto loans.  I've also just received a decent tax refund and have a little bit of liquid cash to allocate towards something.

My responsibilities:

-Student Loans (stafford), Principal balance of $19,594 remaining, spread out over 5 subsidized stafford loans with interest rates ranging from 4.25%-6.55%, and 3 unsubsidized stafford loans all with interest rates of 6.55%.  I'm currently paying into the standard 10-year repayment plan through the loan handler, and my monthly payment is $298.

-Student Loan (perkins), Balance of $5840 and an interest rate of 5%.  I'm currently paying into that one at an amount of $83/mo.

-Auto Loan, Balance of $3007, interest rate of 1.99%, monthly payment of $277/mo

-I pay down credit cards every month and carry zero balance.


Savings/Income:

-Old 401K account sitting dormant at an old employer. I haven't taken any steps for rolling it over into an IRA yet.  I'm vested at an amount somewhere around $5k, but I'm not sure of the exact amount.  It grows slightly with the stock market, but I've contributed nothing to it for going on 2 years now.

-Currently sitting on about $3000 in tax refunds in a standard savings account from my credit union.  This is my ONLY liquid savings or semblance of an emergency fund at this time.

-Salary, I'm taking home about $3600/mo after taxes


My questions:

1) At this time, is there anything better to do with the $3000 in liquid cash that I'm holding other than to keep it as an emergency fund in a savings account?

2) At this time, I'm coming up with a surplus at the end of each month of roughly $300-$400.  What is my best use of that?  Paying down one of my 6.55% loans faster, building my emergency fund, or contributing to a retirement account?

3) Regardless of the answer to #2, what should I do with my old 401k? Should I keep it where it's at (assuming I will make some personal contributions despite having none from my employer), or should I roll it over into a Roth or Traditional IRA?

technology,Hey guys do you remember that FCC vote that's happening in a few days that we all care about? Well Mignon Clyburn is trying to change the proposal at the last minute...,"This was submitted earlier by another user but no one is up voting it so I decided to just post the entire article here 

&gt;Democrat on the Federal Communications Commission wants to narrow the scope of new net neutrality rules that are set for a vote on Thursday, The Hill has learned.
Mignon Clyburn, one of three Democrats on the FCC, has asked Chairman Tom Wheeler to roll back some of the restrictions before the full commission votes on them, FCC officials said.
The request — which Wheeler has yet to respond to — puts the chairman in the awkward position of having to either roll back his proposals, or defend the tough rules and convince Clyburn to back down.
It’s an ironic spot for Wheeler, who for months was considered to be favoring weaker rules than those pushed for by his fellow Democrats, before he reversed himself about backing tougher restrictions on Internet service providers.
Wheeler will need the votes of both Clyburn and Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel to pass the rules since the two Republicans on the commission are expected to vote against anything he proposes.  
Clyburn’s changes would leave in place the central and most controversial component of Wheeler’s rules — the notion that broadband Internet service should be reclassified so that it can be treated as a “telecommunications” service under Title II of the Communications Act, similar to utilities like phone lines.
Proponents of net neutrality have said that move is the surest way to prevent Internet service providers from interfering with people’s access to the Web.
However, she wants to eliminate a new legal category of “broadband subscriber access services,” which was created as an additional point of legal authority for the FCC to monitor the ways that companies hand off traffic on the back end of the Internet.
Those deals, known as “interconnection” arrangements, became a point of contention last year, when Netflix accused Comcast and other companies of erecting “Internet tolls” before easily passing Web traffic from one network to another.
The initial plan sought by Wheeler would allow the FCC to investigate and take action against deals that are “not just and reasonable,” according to a fact sheet released by the FCC earlier this month.
Eliminating the new legal category could make it trickier for the FCC to police those arrangements, said the FCC officials, who were granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the ongoing negotiations. 
Other FCC officials have previously said that the broader act of reclassifying broadband Internet service would, in and of itself, give the commission enough powers to oversee interconnection deals. That opinion has been backed up by lawyers at Google, among others, who made the argument to FCC officials last week.
Clyburn’s changes also would replace a new standard for Internet service providers’ conduct, which was meant to act as a catchall rule for any future behavior that might abuse consumers. That standard would be swapped out with potentially narrower language from 2010 rules that prevented “unreasonable discrimination.” A federal court tossed out those 2010 rules early last year, setting the stage for the FCC to write new rules. 
The full text of the rules will not be revealed to the public until after the FCC’s vote on Thursday morning.
Clyburn declined to discuss specific changes she was supporting on Tuesday.
“This is a process that is an interaction with all five members of the commission and their offices,” she said after remarks at a policy forum hosted by Comptel, a trade group.
“I will just say that I am attempting to strike a balance and whatever you hear, whether it’s accurate or not, is a reflection of my enthusiastic willingness to do so.”
In a speech at the Federal Communications Bar Association last week, the commissioner said that she was “pleased” with the initial draft but also hinted that she might need some fixes to strike that balance between “strong” protections for consumers and “clarity” for investors.
“Some have expressed concerns about allowing private rights of action in court, failing to consider the impact on smaller [Internet service providers], that including interconnection goes too far or that the case-by-case approach does not go far enough and that the new conduct rule may not be as strong as the previous unreasonable discrimination rule,” she said.
The requested changes come as FCC lawyers are spending hours poring over the text of the rules.
In keeping with FCC procedural rules, the four other commissioners outside of Wheeler’s office got their first look at the rules just two and a half weeks ago. Now they are scrambling to make edits ahead of the vote on Thursday morning.

personalfinance,Lower 401(k) contributions to pay of CCs faster?,"Details: Family of 3, me, wife, kid. I'll be 31 in a month. Just under $25000 in CC debt at varying interest rates (about $9k at 0%, most at around 20%). Just started a new job, initially set 401(k) contributions to 10%, thinking of lowering them in order to have more money to pay off the cards.

We are coming out of a few really hard years employment-wise. We both finally have stable and good-paying jobs with good benefits. 

I had a large (for my age) 401(k) when I was in my early 20s but the ensuing lean years forced me to cash that out and I never was able to start again until now, so I have a shiny new 401(k) account with about $300 in it since starting my new job about a month ago. 

I want to aggressively pay off the (fairly) massive CC debt we've had to accumulate recently but I also want to aggressively pay into my 401(k). 

SO, taking a short-term view, it's almost certainly better to forego the retirement contributions in favor of cleaning up the cards as this will ease the budget (min pays), result in less interest, help our FICO scores, and result in less stress for me.

HOWEVER, what's the long-term view? Am I really sacrificing much re: the time value of money if I forego any significant contributions for 6 - 12 months? Or would it be better to contribute heavily and pay the CCs off more slowly with what's left?

personalfinance,Authorized user on charged off account surprise,"Please excuse the throwaway. I am a long-time lurker here, but there are some people in my life who know my username and have pretty poor respect for boundaries. I don't need them knowing anything about my family's finances.

My husband and I have begun the process of purchasing our first house, and were pre-approved for a mortgage with no problems. We both have credit right around 765 as per our free annual reports. The mortgage rate quoted was 4.17%. It was a little higher than we expected, and we were and are still planning on meeting with another lender to see if we are given the same offer. However, as part of the process, we received credit report letters from the mortgage company. Mine was exactly what I expected it to be, however, his showed a credit score of 687 from Equifax and a “serious delinquency”.

My husband has never been delinquent on any credit account in his life, and his free report doesn’t show anything about this, so we paid for the more detailed Equifax snapshot and did a little digging. Equifax has a record of a credit account from a major bank which is marked as “Closed at consumer request, charged off,” with a balance of about $2,500 and $576 due. It was reported in October 2014. The payment history shows a 30 day late payment in June 2008, then a string of missed payments from October 2008 - February 2009, years of “pays as agreed” statuses, and then a charge-off in October 2013. It was reported to Equifax in October 2014. I have never had an account go into delinquency either, so I’m guessing this was some kind of settlement with the account holder?

This is not my husband’s account, but he is listed as an authorized user. We think it belonged to his ex-wife and he was added as a user without his knowledge, and we’re trying to get ahold of her to see if this is indeed the case. However, it is also the oldest account on his history, by almost four years. I’ve already done some research into how to get this account removed from his credit report, which looks like it’s going to be a bit of a hassle but not necessarily impossible, but I’m wondering if it’s the most prudent move. It’s clearly damaging his credit status with the mortgage broker given the report they came back to us with, but might another broker use a different agency or model and come up with something different? Will removing a negative account which does not belong to him but is reported on his account in any capacity do more good than the damage removing the longest open account will cause?  Also, should we expect to see all of this play out in the interest rate we might ultimately be offered?

personalfinance,Homeowner Moving - Rent Current Home or Sell?,"Hey everyone,
Kind of a simple question that can get complex depending on the situation, so I'll try and give as much information as I can. 

I bought my first house July 2013, and I will be relocating from Minnesota to the California bay area this summer. I bought a cheap starter home near downtown in the city I live in on a 15 year mortgage at 2.8% interest. As the bay area is incredibly expensive, I don't plan on buying when I move out there.

My only significant debt is ~$28k in student loans.

After consulting with realtors I believe I could rent my home for ~$100 more than my 15 year mortgage. If I sold I would net about $20k after paying off my mortgage (Probably would not be selling for a profit, selling for around the same I paid).

My question is would the benefits associated with having a small side business / owning a home be worth it financially? I know there are a lot of things tax wise I can do to write off losses and improvements on the home. I also like the idea of diversifying my investments. My interest rate being what it is, I feel pretty bad selling my home, and if I can make money, or at least break even renting it seems like a good bet for me.

If my home were to sit vacant, I wouldn't be happy about it but I would be able to get by figuring I rent an apartment in the Bay area. It is fairly easy to rent homes in my area, and a lot of professional types come through every year.

I would probably manage the property using a property manager.

If I sell I will probably dump most of what I get into my $28k of student loans and be left with around $8k

Thanks for any advice! I'm leaning towards keeping it now, just because I think my interest rate is a great deal, and I think home values in the area I live in are going to start trending up.

I currently make $40k a year, but will get a raise in March (how much is still in the air). My boss said it will go up to $55k, but I'm not banking on it until the paychecks start coming in. I have about $6k in the bank (oh shit fund) at the moment, and will probably build that up a bit more before investing further.

I'm currently in temporary housing and I was hoping to have my apartment picked out yesterday, but this has effectively blocked me.

A little background on my debt owed (short version): 2 roommates and I moved out of a rented house and we get a large bill full of bullshit fees that were highly inflated, trying to get ~$4300 from us. Minus the $2400 deposit we owe ~$1900. Apparently these landlords have done this in the past, and the rental agency assures us that they will take care of it and we just write off the $2400 and call it even. Over a year later, we all get a letter saying that we owe the ~$1900 + interest. Being fed up with this shit and being young and dumb, we do nothing to fight it. Fast forward to about September 2014, and the debt falls off both of my old roommates credit reports, but not mine. It's still on mine to this day and I don't understand why.

A little more background

Original Balance: $1961
Current Balance: $2322
Date Opened: September 21, 2011
Report Date (Last Reported): February 1, 2012
Responsibility: Joint

We moved out of this house in I believe April 2010. I guess my question is twofold:

1. Why is it that it dropped off of their credit reports but not mine? I don't recall ever answering a phone call from them or anything. I never responded to any mail I got from them and neither did they. Or another way of asking this is if the responsibility is ""joint"" then why is it only on my credit report?

2. Is there any possible way to get around paying this so that I can get a damn place to live, or am I screwed? I was reading the FAQ and it said that the debt is still owed if it falls off your report and at anytime another agency can pick it up and try to get you to pay them. Also, when would the SOL be up on this? This took place in Arizona. I would hate to pay it like a month before it falls off or something...$2322 is a lot of money to me.

Thank you for any light you can shed on the situation. At this point I'm looking at paying them in full (trying to request a pay for delete??) so that I can find a nice apartment. If it comes to that, I can get the money. I just don't want to pay them out of spite for screwing us over and now making me deal with all of this haha.",finance,1424833615

personalfinance,Question about mortgage out of grad school,"Hello, myself and my girlfriend, mid 20s, are currently enrolled in PhD programs.  We have both decided we will be dropping out at the end of this semester.  I have secured a job in NYC at a Fortune 500 company, base salary of $105k with bonuses and stock expected to bring it to around $145k.  She is going to be working on her teaching certification and probably tutoring/subbing in the meantime until she can find a more permanent position. We each currently have stipends of about $25k each in graduate school.

We are looking into places to live in the NJ suburbs. We currently live together and are renting, but we are wondering if perhaps we should also consider buying a house or condo rather than renting when we move to NJ.  It looks like it might be tough to find a suitable place, so keeping as many options open as possible will be good.

So my question is- is it possible for us to qualify for a mortgage at this stage, or will we need a few years of steady jobs to qualify? And if we do qualify, will the interest rates be reasonable? Neither of us have any debt of any sort, our combined assets total to around 150k (of which a significant chunk could go toward the down payment) and we both have had credit cards for quite a while and are never late on payments, and as far as we can tell have good credit scores.

So should we consider buying an option, or only be looking into renting right now?",finance,1424837393
stocks,GOOG is History's Most Complicated Tulip Bubble.,"There are two ways for a share to derive end user utility.  Through dividends and through being owned in a large enough quantity to actually affect ownership of the company.  Well what about non-voting GOOG Class - C shares?  You could own all the Class - C shares you want, and you'd still never own the company.  So that leaves dividends.  But GOOG doesn't pay a dividend.  But in the future it might.

But, for argument's sake, let's say that GOOG will never pay a dividend.  Or if that is too far fetched, then let's say Google releases a new Class - D share.  A, B, and C will pay a dividend, but D's are absolutely, 100%, set in stone, never going to pay a dividend.

Are Class - D shares worth anything?

Well of course.  But how?  They don't have any end user utility.  

Welcome to modern finance.  Either does a dollar bill.  There's a great scene in the Walking Dead where Daryl comes across a large bundle of money in a country club.  He takes the money and burns it.  Not only did the scene serve as a great character moment where we learn how resentful Daryl is for growing up in poverty, but it's also a wonderful social commentary.  With society collapsed, the only purpose money serves is to be burned.  Which is ironic.  Because money always burned.  It didn't have to be harvested, and inked, and printed out, and distributed thru a monetary policy by a central bank, to be traded back and forth for decades in various economic systems.  It could have just as easily been burnt as wood or crop.  Ash to ash.  Dust to dust.  But I digress.

Money's only value is fiduciary.  It's worth something because you can trade it for something else, and that something else will provide you with end utility.  Like a blow job or whatever.

So what does this have to do with stocks?  Well, stocks are essentially private currencies.  Just like money is backed by the full faith of the U.S. government, stocks are backed by the full faith of the corporation.  And just like the US government, corporations can inflate or deflate the supply.  And a currency's purchasing power is determined by the strength of it's underlying economy.  In case of a business, the underlying economics of the business. 
 
But the analogy does have limits.  A dollar can buy part of the economy by which it is backed.  But the Class - C can never do that.  Not that people seem to care.  There's a $2 difference between Class - A and Class - C shares.  Which is fitting, because they all essentially have zero voting rights because the founders own the Class - B shares. 

The Class - C's only value is that some day, Google may offer a dividend.  (And Class - A has the additional value that some day, the founders will give up their 56% voting stake, and Class - A's one vote will matter again.)

But I doubt anyone is actually valuing Class - A and Class - C shares based on future dividend and ownership possibilities.  They're being traded on the greater fool theory.  That they can sell it for more than they paid for it.  And I doubt that Class - D shares would trail Class - C shares by any meaningful amount.

So it's kind of funny.  Centuries after the tulip bubble, we're up to the same old tricks.  Except this time we're not even trading something as tangible as a tulip.  We're trading numbers that exist in electricity and magnetism.  Mankind's evolution is astounding.",finance,1424839341

gaming,Should we expect more from remakes or remasters?,"I honestly love remakes and re-releases. To play the same game over again with better textures, cleaner image and being able to make out all objects is just pure bliss especially when you originally loved the game; it's just great.

However... Something always bugged me. 

Remake: So you claimed your game is a remake when you literally just updated the textures? That's a remaster. Not a remake. Please people stop claiming things are remakes when they aren't.

Here's where I get a little miffed though... It's such a cash grab, but at the same time I can't be mad. To update the textures, do some minor graphical improvements seems so lazy.

Why shouldn't we expect new content? Even a remaster could have added new content. It's not physically limited at that point. 

Take Wind Waker HD. I love that game, I really fucking love that game. Bought the HD release and loved it again. Why don't they ever add anything new? Hell throw a single new dungeon, maybe a couple minor dungeons, hell here's a thought how about some new toys to play with? Arguably though this isn't a perfect example. They did make some big changes and small changes but it was mostly just introducing a character, getting an item in a different location, triforce piece instead of triforce map. That said... Why couldn't we have gotten the Hero Mode to include differing dungeons like in Master Quest? Harder puzzles. etc.

Resident Evil HD Release: This one bugs me. Most people don't know this isn't a remake, it's a HD remaster OF the remake(Gamecube version) which is pretty gorgeous and plays well. Some of the new trial modes are neat and scoring system is neat as well... That was it? How hard would it have been to I don't know add a couple new rooms, some new guns, HELL a zombie survival mode.

This has always bugged me. StarFox 3ds? Give us a new god damn planet/location or two. Hell a super secret boss. Zelda OoT 3ds? Hello? Why not do a mode to allow playing of master quest dungeons, a new sword or not even a new sword, an upgraded weapon or two. HELL Why not fucking finish the original version of ura zelda? Add that wind temple in, the other content that was dropped out etc.

Majora's Mask 3ds? Fuck I wanted this game so bad and it's here, but new content? Not so much. Improved controls are nice as well as the improved look. It's still lacking though. Of course adding a new dungeon would be hard in this game, but that's not to say you could pull a master quest on it, or add some new quests, maybe a new mask... Maybe something something like... Fuck knows a couple new NPCs.

It just bugs me. Yes it takes a lot of work to redo textures, redo some controls, and add maybe a time trial mode/boss rush mode but not as hard as creating a game from scratch. Adding areas in an already finished game, adding new items, or expanding some areas would be fairly easy in comparison to making a new game from scratch.

You know what remake did it right? A link between worlds. Some people don't classify that as a remake but it's nearly the definition of remake. Loosely stick to the same concept, stick to the same overworld, loosely stick to the same plot but also throw it on it's head with new mechanics, new dungeons, new items, etc. That's a remake worth every fucking penny, and most people don't even consider it a remake.",technology,1424842595

personalfinance,Top five most confusing financial topics revealed,"While most of you readers are pretty well aware of all things money here at The Savvy Scot, I have to say I was sadly not that surprised to read the findings of Legal &amp; General’s recent research, reporting that 53% of adults in Britain say they have received poor financial education, or none at all. We spend almost 20 years at school, yet one of the most important topics that would set up great foundations for our adult life is being ignored.
Parents often expect the schools to do part of the child’s upbringing, and neglect to talk about essential matters as well.
Legal &amp; General reports that the top five personal finance topics people understand the least are
1. Annuities
2. Access to personal pension plans
3. Auto-enrolment
4. Help-to-buy
5. and… Investments.
 
22% of adults have a hard time grasping the concept behind investing. Wow. How can you prepare your future if you are part of those one in five who are unfamiliar with how to allocate your money?
I also noted that none of the debt concepts, like debt consolidation or interest rate were part of the things people were unfamiliar with. Even more to be concerned about.
Out of people who approach retirement, a third don’t understand annuities and a quarter have no idea how to access their personal pension plan. Half of the interviewed workers also comment that they feel guilty about focusing on their finances for more than five minutes during their workday, which is when most of the institutions like banks are open, making it harder for them to plan their financial future after hours. Banks and financial institutions have surely made an effort those part years to expand their office hours, and to implement online banking 24/7, but still employees are worried about their management frowning upon their attempt to keep up with their finances.
To help adults become more familiar with complicated personal finance topics, Nigel Wilson, CEO of Legal &amp; General is hosting a hangout on family finances tomorrow.

Thinking aggressive plan but considering PSLF. Is it worth it to repay aggressively and give up stuff like wedding and kids?]**

**ETA: Thank you so much to everyone for your replies - they were so helpful and I really appreciate you taking the time.**

Hi all - this subreddit has been very helpful to me but I wanted to see if I could get some advice from you about my situation.

I (25 y/o) am in my last year of law school, will be graduating with around $205k in federal loans (obviously kicking my younger self for this horrible decision). I will be starting at a large firm this fall, making around $160k my first year, with good salary increases each year after that. 

Fiance (29 y/o) graduated a year before me, and is already working. He is a DA/PD, so his law school loans (all federal - around $145k) are on minimum payments and the ten-year PSLF. My thinking is that leaving that $145k on PSLF is the right thing to do, especially because his income isn't high and so paying them back more quickly just isn't really an option. 

He also has $60k in undergraduate student loans, which are not federal, and therefore can't be added to his PSLF.

ETA - Fiance currently works in another city, so we maintain two apartments (though our rents are literally as low as possible). He plans to move back here in about a year and half, and sharing a single apartment then should help us lower living expenses even more.

Our thinking right now is to live incredibly frugally and to try to put around $60k during my first year of work towards my federal law loans and his non-federal undergrad loans, a number which should be able to be increased each year as I get raises (my income should increase about $20k for my second year, and so on). This plan obviously involves a lot of frugality, including putting off kids until we have repaid (under this plan, I hope to have repaid in around 7 years), and, most painfully, probably eloping instead of having a wedding. 

My field (corporate biglaw) also has a high attrition/burnout rate and I worry a bit about wanting out after a couple of years but not being able to because of ambitious repayment - that aspect has made PAYE attractive, since it would let me more easily jump ship for a lower-paying job if I needed to. 

So, I have two big questions:
(1) Is this prospective payment idea TCR? As I said, PAYE is also an option on my federal loans.
(2) In terms of frugality, and especially the wedding situation, I was wondering if anyone here could speak to regrets/non-regrets they have about making similar choices. I want to be debt-free but I also don't want to be miserable.

I'll also need to buy some furniture (I have none. Not even a bed!) and pay the up front deposit on the new place. 

My question is this... should I still keep throwing money at my debt during this moving process, or hold onto it to deal with expenses coming from move? I could send the $850 to my debt, which would help to keep the debt snowball rolling and lower my minimums, and then draw from extra $400-600 in my budget that I usually send to debt, plus my emergency fund, to handle the moving expenses.

I anticipate expenses to be ~$800 for a deposit, $800-900 for rent (up from $600), then $200-$300 to buy a cheap bed, table, chair, pot, pan, fork, knife and spatula. I'll probably get $400-$500 back for the deposit at my current place, which will of course get re-applied to debt.

personalfinance,"Student loan trouble, not sure what to do","To start, I have looked at the FAQ in regards to Student Loans for a general idea, but I feel that some aspects of the situation are unique enough to warrant its own post.

My girlfriend and I graduated college in May of 2013. I had a very small amount of student loans, I knew she on the other hand had a significant amount, but until recently I wasn't aware of how much. She was applying for some loan repayment through her work and I asked to see her loan paperwork to help enter the information. 

She has loans from 9 smaller loans from 2 different lenders currently valued at $33,000 total, with interest rates ranging from 3.2% to 6.6%. The majority of the rates are below 5% and this payment amounts to a little over $400/month. Although not ideal, this is something I can deal with, and also something her job will be willing to assist with.

What caught me off guard was the fact that she is paying a little over $800/month on student loans taken out in her parents name. The lender is Fedloan Servicing, I believe they are called Parent Plus Loans. There are 7 loans which total to current balance of just over $62,000. The interest rate on these is either 7.9% or 8.5%, averaging out to 8.06% for the full amount.

I knew she had a lot of debt, but I did not realize the bulk of it wasn't in her name. Her job will not pay money towards these loans. Even though she is making payments they are technically not her loans. It also reduces the amount they will pay towards the loans that are in her name, as it is a completely need based program.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I am not sure what the best plan of attack is. I'm assuming refinancing all the loans into her name and trying to get a lower rate is the best option, but I have no idea what the best way to go about doing this is. I also remember reading that if you pay 10% of your income for 10 years, the rest will be forgiven. I am not sure if this was ever passed, or how it would even work with them not being in her name,

Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation, or any input on what we should do to try and minimize what she will be paying going foward? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Situation: My tuition this semester is $8662.03. It was paid with a College Illinois! 529 plan ($5569.00), a federal Pell grant ($2590.00), and a federal subsidized loan ($1990.00). Those three add up to $10,149.00. That comes out to $1,485.97 over my tuition; I received a check from the school labelled ""Fed subsidized loan"" for $1466. I called and my school's financial aid department said that they use money to pay for tuition in order of best for the student to worst (i.e. subsidized before unsubsidized). The only payment I had with interest was the subsidized loan, so they used that after the other two, but only ~$500 of it. The rest came back to me and now I'm wondering two things:



+ I assume the full amount of ~$2k will need to be paid back for the subsidized loan, so I can't use my $1466 check to repay the $500 they took out from the total subsidized amount, can I?



+ If I can't do anything with the check now and don't need the money, is there a mid- to long-term solution to make some money off of it? I'm thinking a savings account or 6-month CD so I can use it to pay for my next semester this fall.",finance,1424893064

My fiancee and I are getting married in May. Currently we live with my parents and are looking to move out soon after the wedding. We were initially looking for places to rent in our area and found most places were $500 at the low end. Out of curiosity I looked to see what homes were for sale near us and found a few that were less than $30,000. At that rate I could easily have the house paid off completely in less than 10 years while still paying a similar monthly rate as renting. Some of these houses were obviously fixer uppers but a couple of the houses are simply small houses on small lots which, to me seems to warrant the low cost.

I've never missed or been late on a payment, but due to recent expenses (car, house, baby) I'd like to lower the monthly slightly too, at least until I can pay down credit cards and set aside a decent emergency fund.

My loans are currently ~$107k from an engineering MA. $65K is GPlus at 7.55%, $16K is subsidized Stafford at 6.5%, and the rest is an usubsidized Stafford at the same rate.  I currently pay $950/mo, most going toward the GPlus.  That's pretty near the minimum for my plan.

For comparison:
    Mortgage $1600/mo @ 4.125% (plus $250 condo fee)
    Credit cards $600/mo @ ~13%, ($9,000 balance from moving, appliances, repairs) 
    Car $200/mo @ 3.9%  
    Utilities $100-250 depending on season.
    Undergrad loans, $110/mo at ~2.5%

I borrow from my wife for day-to-day (we keep a handy spreadsheet and I insist on paying her back someday) but I want to pay off the cards faster to give me some breathing room in my monthly budget.  Obviously it's CC first, loans, then the rest over time.

I have the option of a loan at LIBOR+4.22% for the full amount.  However I will be giving up the usual federal protections.  My math says I will save about $15K over the life of my loan while also reducing my payments by $300/month, letting me pay my cards faster and have an actual, legitimate budget. The risks as I see it are, 1) LIBOR rising above 3% in the next 15 years, 2) Unemployment, 3) ???.

I work for a non-profit research group, although I can't claim the last 3 years because my bills aren't 'consolidated correctly' and weren't on IBR/PAYE. I could do that now and get forgiveness in 10 years, limiting my career choices and salary potential.

personalfinance,Minister with some tax questions,"I'm an ordained minister (as of 2015) so that means when I pay my 2015 taxes things will be different than the previous years. 

I've always done my own taxes, and my brother who is a financial consultant has always helped me. 2014 has been done on my own, and I just want to learn and prepare for what to expect in 2015 when I do my own taxes again.

But, with being an official minister and no longer considered an employee, it obviously changes things. 

From everything I have read and understood, my income now (after health, expenses, and housing) I am responsible for both FIT (also taking into account my wife's job) and SECA (15.3%).

I am an employee when it comes to federal income tax, but self-employed in regards to SS.

Thus, understanding this, I know the 1040 SE will be filled out. I have done so in the past due to some freelance work I have done, but it was obviously minimal. But now, my sole income will be reported on a W2, but I will be making quarterly payments for my SECA and my FIT (although, in combination with my wife's job, monthly, we are having the majority of our FIT pulled from her paychecks...)

So, after all of this rambling, I am just looking to see if anyone here can help me make sense of the Long Form SE as it regards to my income in the future as I am planning.

1.) I will pay BOTH income tax and SECA in quarterly payments. But, the major chunk of that payment (95%) will be SECA. The income tax will mostly come from my wife's salary. Therefore, on the 1040 when it gives estimated tax payments and I enter that in, how is that figured on a 1040/income tax return. Is SECA treated the same as FIT when it comes to returns and filing? The 1040-ES doesn't have a place to split FIT and SECA, but I know you pay both.

2.) The 1040 SE Long vs. Short confuses me. I know that you get 50% of your SECA claimed back on your 1040 when you file (line 56). As stated, I had always done the short, because it was business income as a freelance writer. But now, it appears I would go SE Long. With that said, my 1040-es would end up being just under $4k for 2015 for SECA. So I assume that that means line 56 would end up right around the $2k mark? I haven't fully looked through the long form, but I assume it isn't too different than short. Can anyone ELI5 the short vs. long?

Essentially, I just want to learn because I like to know this stuff and handle my own finances. I'm cheap at heart, and don't like to pay someone to do something I can learn to do on my own. Plus, I want to understand how my money works.

Hopefully I have explained these things fully and to the point where those wiser than I can understand what I am asking.

I have a mortgage and feel that refinancing might save me a little money. When I originally purchased the house, I had a fair credit score, now, more than a year later, my credit score has improved significantly. I am now at that magical point - credit karma has my scores at 717 and 711 - so I am ALMOST to 720. I know that 720 will allow me to have the lowest interest rate. (Yes, I am aware that credit karma is not perfect, and they are often higher.) I want to GUARANTEE that when they run my credit it will be over 720. Is there anything I could do to jump a couple points?

One thing I have thought of...my bank keeps on offering me a higher credit limit on my card (which is currently at $300....very low for my financial situation). If I were to increase the credit limit, would that help for my available credit?

personalfinance,"First ""real"" job, single mother, will likely be homeless soon. What should I claim/when can I ask for a raise?","To keep this short I'll skip a lot of the back  story but my parents have helped me out lately. Just started my first post - college job 3 weeks ago and am in Kansas. I make 32000 but am technically paid hourly. My first paycheck came today and it was a whopping 1000. My rent is 630, daycare is 1268 a month, gas is 40 (level pay), electric is roughly 20 right now, gas for my car is 120 a month, I can live off 50 a week for groceries (or less, let's be hones), diapers and wipes are about 45 a month. No debt, car paid off. Parents cover car and health insurance right now.

So, clearly my job will not support all that. That's a fucking depressing turn from my excitement about getting a job a month after graduating. My parents can help me for a little bit longer but I have got to make some changes. I feel pathetic for still requiring their help.

1) any idea what a single mother as head of household can expect on tax return having made just above minimum wage last year? 2K tops?

2) when is it acceptable to ask for a raise/how much can I ask for? It's a fast growing company that buys things cheap from big companies and sells them to little companies. They're creating many new positions right now. I'm an assistant to the marketing guy. 

3) anyone know of a loophole to get government help? What a shit system. If I made 2K less per year they would help with my daycare cost, give me gas money for work and food stamps. But boy that extra 2K a year practically makes me rich, doesn't it? Is it horribly tacky to just ask my boss to pay me *less* (I am only sort of joking here)

3) what should I be claiming to receive the most each paycheck but not wind up owing next year? I have always claimed zero. I claimed two since I have a baby now. But I still lost 100 to federal, 75 to state and about 60 more to the other two I can't remember (social security and another one?)

Also, when I do get insurance it is 100% covered by the company for me and my kiddo is on state insurance so that's good. I'm clearly not interested in the 401K they offer right now despite the fact that they match 4%. I get 60 hours PTO this year and will get 80 hours next year. 

Hope I included everything necessary. Guys, I miscalculated my income by 600 a month because I get paid every two weeks which I didn't account for and I didn't think I would lose nearly 200 to the government. I just divided 32000 by 12 and then by 2.

**Bonus Edit:** In light of Reddit's signature Dwight Schrute comments below, I'd also like to add that the Mexican fisherman failed to mention that he also has excellent insurance, which he can afford by living in a small house, walking to work everyday, and saving 15% of his income. He also would like to add that no one would literally advocate for living an impoverished lifestyle nor living paycheck-to-paycheck. *Obviously.*

---

An American investment banker was taking a much-needed vacation in a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. The boat had several large, fresh fish in it.

The investment banker was impressed by the quality of the fish and asked the Mexican how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied, “Only a little while.” The banker then asked why he didn’t stay out longer and catch more fish?

The Mexican fisherman replied he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs.

The American then asked, “But what do you do with the rest of your time?”

The Mexican fisherman replied, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos: I have a full and busy life, señor.”

The investment banker scoffed, “I am an Ivy League MBA, and I could help you. You could spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat, and with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats until eventually you would have a whole fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to the middleman you could sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You could control the product, processing and distribution.”

Then he added, “Of course, you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City where you would run your growing enterprise.”

The Mexican fisherman asked, “But señor, how long will this all take?”

To which the American replied, “15-20 years.”

“But what then?” asked the Mexican.

The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You could make millions.”

“Millions, señor? Then what?”

To which the investment banker replied, “Then you would retire. You could move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”",finance,1424926243
personalfinance,"Why not 0 Down, 100% Financed Mortgage?","I'm looking at buying a house well within my budget. 200 ~ 250k on a 130k salary. I recently paid off all my student loans, and I don't see the point in saving up 20% for a down payment.

Interest rates are so low right now, and I plan on going for a 15 year mortgage. 

My understanding is that large down payments favor the lenders more than the borrowers. I have great credit, and I can afford the payments (and insurance and taxes) no problem, if my credit union wants to offer me a sub-5% rate on a no downpayment, 15 year mortgage, with no PMI, why not take it?

Instead of saving up for a downpayment, I can invest that money in a nice index fund. The markets, currently and historically, well outperform current mortgage rates. According to some quick modeling, the gains from investing will even out the higher cost of a no-money-down mortgage.

I’m a 23 year old tax accountant and will be graduating with a masters in Winter 2015 and work towards my CPA. I am currently working and have a salary of $38,000 a year and do not have many expenses. My employer covers my health insurance (high deductible plan but they contribute to an HSA). I do not have rent expenses yet and have no plans on moving: if I do it will be in 2-3 years. I have a car and it is paid off. I pay the balance on my credit cards, the only debt I have is from federal student loans, which I have already started paying off. Expenses were a little high in the last few months for various reasons but I should be able to follow more closely to my budget now. 

The FAQ in the sidebar helped me understand the basics that all people should start with so I’ve set up my emergency fund in a savings account with an extra 10% of my paycheck going towards it. At this point, I’d like to see what would be the most beneficial move. Here is what I had in mind.

1. Continue saving until I have enough to cover the rest of my tuition expenses for the remainder of my classes ($7,800). I’ve gotten into the habit of saving for future expenses.
1. Open an IRA? I am still doing my research on this but am unsure if it’s wise to put money in there now or wait until I got my big expenses out the way.
1. Pay more on my student loans to get rid of the soul-sucking debt. I’m currently in a “refund” phase for the $10,000 loan so I figured paying more now would be beneficial.

The Federal Communications Commission has decided to **apply the same rules that govern the telephone service to broadband internet**, in an attempt to ensure the fair and equal treatment of all traffic on the Internet, with three commissioners voting in favour and two against.

This reclassification of fixed and mobile broadband as a telecommunications service means that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will be regulated as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. 

The US Telecommunications Industry Association said that broadband providers would take ""immediate"" legal action over the rule changes.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said:

&gt; This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept: openness, expression and an absence of gatekeepers telling them what they can do, where they can go and what they can think.”

###What does this mean?

The main changes for broadband providers, as summarised by the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31638528), are as follows:

* Broadband access is being reclassified as a telecommunications service and utility, like electricity and water, meaning it will be subject to much heavier regulation

* Broadband providers cannot block or speed up connections for a fee - all data should be treated equally

* Internet providers cannot strike deals with content firms, known as paid prioritisation, for smoother delivery of traffic to consumers

* Interconnection deals, where content companies pay broadband providers to connect to their networks, will also be regulated

* Firms which feel that unjust fees have been levied can complain to the FCC. Each one will be dealt with on a case by case basi

All of the rules will also apply to mobile providers as well as fixed line providers.

Under the new rules, the FCC will have a variety of new powers, including:

* They will be able to enforce consumer privacy rules

* They will be able to extract money from Internet providers to help subsidize services for rural Americans, educators and the poor

* They will be able to ensure services such as Google Fiber are able to build new broadband pipes faster and at less cost.

Regulations have been relaxed somewhat, allowing local Internet providers to compete with the more established ISPs

_____________________________________________

I will be paying off the Credit Card next month. On the car loan I am required to pay $267/month, so I have 7 payments remaining -- I used to pay $445/month, but with agreement to my folks I agreed to allow the car as collateral against a newly structured loan my parents set up for some of their stuff (basically it rolled all their current debts more or less into one loan, which gave them a lower interest rate overall and a better situation). The agreement (in writing) stands that I pay off what was remaining of my car loan, and then they will take over making payments on the remaining total loan amount that encompasses their own stuff. The only reason I haven't paid off the car loan amount fully at this point is to allow my mother time to pay off some smaller stuff before she begins making payments on the total loan for her end.

In any case, the car loan will be paid off this year, as will the SUV (currently not making payments as an official bill has not been sent yet).

Once all of these are taken care of, the only remaining debt(s) I will have to my name are my Student Loans. Once this session ends, I will only have 5 courses remaining for my Bachelor's Degree, and due to scheduling offerings, I will at most only be taking 1 course at a time (Soonest estimated Graduation would be May 2015). To go along with this, I am now in a stable job position with my Employer offering full Tuition Reimbursement of any course required for the degree I am seeking -- A/B 100% Reimbursements, C 75%, and so on.

I plan to have my parents finish their side of the FAFSA and submit this week, though I am debating on if I should accept a loan for the upcoming (final) school year? I have a good amount in savings which I could cover each class at a time (~$750.00 each counting Textbooks). Since I am still in school I am currently not making payments towards my Student Loans.

Besides the option of beginning to make payments on my Student Loans, I also want to add some extra *umph* to my Retirement Savings. Currently I have the following towards retirement (I am 23):

* Nationwide 457: _____**$5,993.02**
* Employer Pension Plan: **$4,679.05**

With my Employer Pension Plan (based on my salary), I receive a full match in contributions up to 6.86%, which I am doing. There is a 5yr Vestment period, and I will be at 2 this October. Besides these I have been debating on starting a ROTH IRA or something like a CD ladder (1-5yr all started at the same time with either $500/$1,000, then recycling them each maturity). 

My current accelerated goal would be to pay off my Student Loans in 5-7 years (once beginning repayment) instead of the standard 10yr plan (would be putting $500 minimum towards these each month). The soon-negated car loan this year will alone cover half of that payment with those previous held funds, with my already decent gross salary of $45,000 expected to increase somewhat in May.

Does anyone have suggestions for the best route I should consider with expanding retirement planning? Or should I just focus on paying off the loans before expanding my Retirement sights?

**tl;dr: After paying off smaller debts should I begin paying [early] payments towards student loans, expanding methods of saving towards retirement, or some approach towards both?**

In the last three months I've been getting bombarded with letters in the mail from all sorts of companies to refinance my mortgage.  It's only about ten months old. I didn't pay much attention to them until I got the same offer from my own mortgage company,  and then another from the company that helped me buy the house. 

Did something significant chance recently,  or is this a normal part of home ownership? Here's an example of one such offer I got:

&gt;&gt; We have a no cost streamline FHA refi that might pencil out for you with regard to saving on interest over the long term as well as lower the monthly expense.

&gt;&gt; FHA just announced a large reduction in the monthly mortgage insurance premium. That in combination with the recent drop in interest rates in the low 3%’s makes this a good opportunity to take advantage of these changes.

personalfinance,Am I wrong to make my parents pay for loans I had no control over?,"Long time lurker, first time poster, all that good stuff.  So I went to a small city college years ago after escaping Abusive Parent A and Decent Parent B.  The loans were Stafford Subsidized Loans, quite small ($20K left on the principle), and I excelled at school.  Life was good.

A year and half later, Abusive Parent A joined a cult.  In the interest of keeping things concise, I'll leave it at that.  She uprooted the rest of the family and moved to the middle of nowhere in a different state.  Due to fear of The Homosexual Agenda, she informed me at 18 that unless I transferred to an *extremely* expensive out-of-state school (in a state blessed by a mystic visionary who to this day sells her magic oils), she would block Decent Parent B from signing my loans, and leave me on the street.

So I transferred, with no idea how much this school cost and literally no choice in the matter.  To give you an idea of my naivety, I was raised (even before the cult) in almost total isolation (explicitly forbidden from leaving the farm, never went to any school, was told that CPS would rape my sister if they found out), so it's important to realize that at this point in my life I almost literally did not know how money works.  I'm not talking Roth IRA's.  I'm talking basic bills, anything resembling a budget, or even the concept of tax returns (I was convinced in college that my friends were making that up to see if I was gullible).

In the end, depression and medically-diagnosed ADHD and admittedly an arrogant disgust for this new school caused me to exit school a year before completion.  Regardless, I now work in IT in a job that absolutely requires a college degree, making about twice what my friends with degrees make.  My point is that although I wish I had stayed in school, my current income doesn't reflect that decision.

Two days ago, I finally got to compile all my loan debt.  $20K is loans from School 1, $60K is loans from School 2, of which $46000 is a Federal Parent PLUS Loan

In loan payments, I've been paying $120, $303, and $600 a month, including during periods of actual homelessness where I lived in my car.  My rent is $460 now.  So I pay more than double my rent just in loans, and the weight is suffocating.

So (to the best of my knowledge) Parent PLUS Loans are made only in the name of the parent who took them out.  That's $46K of debt that A) I never needed, B) I never knew about, and C) would not exist if not for Abusive Parent A's narcissistic craving to ruin everything around her.  Also, possibly D) I have no legal obligation to pay  (if this is wrong, please let me know).

If my understanding of the PLUS loan ($303 monthly) is correct, then the burden of debt falls on my parents.  I'm not trying to push my debt on them, but *I did not want this*.  I was never informed of the amount, and I fought the school transfer tooth and nail.  They might as well have forged my signature.

Do you think it's reasonable to expect them to pay at least some of these loans, calculated from the amount of tuition increase between schools?  The weight of these payments is strangling me.

edit: further clarification of my financial situation and how much the loans are pulling me down.  My car has been broken ($700 minimum fix) for over a year, to the point that I cannot go anywhere except access roads.  I've only been able to afford ADHD medication, basic dental and vision thanks to my job's comprehensive insurance.  I'm not poor but that's because of how much I work, and I realistically cannot sustain 55-60 hour weeks much longer just to survive, while the parental units squander money on magic salt and a new house.",finance,1424984715

personalfinance,"Credit Score questions, I have a mediocre credit score and I'm trying to fix it, I've read a lot but is there anything I'm missing that could help?","So I have been reading past posts about improving credit scores on this subreddit, and I've learned a lot but I still have a couple of unanswered questions about my personal credit history and score.

I am 28 years old, have done stupid things with my credit score in the past, and I want to fix it. Currently I have no debt and make around 40K a year, I have 16K in savings. I will hopefully make 60K next year. My credit scores on Credit Karma are 740 from both Transunion and Equifax. BUT, when I went to the annualcreditreport.com site and checked there and then paid for a score from the actual companies, my Equifax score was 650, my Experian score was 607, and Transunion wouldn't even give me a score because 'there wasn't sufficient activity in my account in the last 24 months' even after I paid the $10. The Transunion score refusal is odd because I have a credit card attached to my name and I was paying a student loan over the past 24 months. 

Anyway, I imagine my actual credit score is in the low to mid 600s, and I am a little annoyed at the huge discrepancy between the Credit Karma scores and the actual scores.

The negative marks on my account include:

A *state* tax lien from 2008 that was apparently inacted on 03/2012 and released on 07/2012. The lien was from me being an idiot on my taxes and not understanding how State Tax residency laws work and trying to do my taxes myself right after college after I moved across the country, and the State trying to contact my old address for collections, etc. I paid the amount in full ($450-ish) as soon as I found out about it. Is there any way to get rid of this or will I have to wait the 10 years for it to go off my record in 2022? Will badgering the credit agencies about this one work even though it's a legitimate released lien? I know you can get federal tax liens expunged from your record but I don't know about state tax liens. 

The other negative mark is from late payments on a student loan right after I graduated college. It went to collections, I paid off the amount in full. It was a stupid mistake but again the negative mark is legitimate. Is there any way to get rid of this bad record before it expires in 2019? 

Other Activity:

I have two other student loans I paid off successfully and on time over a period of 3 years, I just finished paying off the last one a couple of months ago. Since I closed the accounts will this negatively effect my credit score?

Credit Cards: I have one AmEx card that was opened in 1999 but cancelled in 2008 due to inactivity with no late payments. I am linked to my Dad's AmEx account which was also opened in 1999 and that card/account has a limit of 18,000 and he pays it in full every month, which is a pretty sweet deal for me and I'm very thankful since that is very positively impacting my score. Today after reviewing my scores I applied for a Capital One Quicksilver card and was immediately approved with a credit limit of $3,000. I plan on keeping it open and paying everything in full every month, only using 0-9% of the available balance as Credit Karma suggests. I should probably wait a couple of months for my limit to go up and then apply for another card right? I am very responsible about my spending and payments now, so I don't see credit card debt being an issue at all.

Is there anything I'm missing and anything else I can do to improve my credit score besides opening up a couple more credit cards and keeping them paid off? I live in a commuter city so I won't be buying a car anytime soon or a house.",finance,1424988868

Income: $105,000
Take home every month after tax and 401K: $4,902.18
Amount to 401K every month: $395.84 (about 5%, company matching a percentage by adding $79.16 per month)

401K (Vanguard): $1,774.67

Student loan debt: $13,944.81 (Starting to put $1000 per month towards this now, not sure if good idea)

No credit card debt.


My biggest monthly expenses:
Rent: $1,400.00/month (Will be lowered in a few months when I move in with my girlfriend and we split rent)
Parents: $235.00/month (I help pay my parents mortgage so they don't lose their house. I can't get rid of this payment.)
Insurance: $111.00/month
Student loan: $1,000.00/month (I used to pay minimum, $240.00, but bumped it up to $500.00, and this month was the first time I bumped it up to $1,000.00/month. This is the BIGGEST headache I'd like to get rid of as fast as possible...)


HOBBIES:
I don't really have hobbies. I do like to go to restaurants socially with friends and girlfriend. I know this eats up a TON of money, so theres an issue there. My only hobby, which I got into recently is collecting Vinyl records and music. It can be expensive, but also cheap if I do it right.

investing,What's it going to take for central banks to tighten monetary policy?,"First time poster on this subreddit; hopefully this doesn't sound stupid.

In the past couple years, central banks seem to be scared shitless by the great recession and its implications. The fact that asset classes were more correlated than were once believed made the banks wary of ""contagion effects"" from events like Greece defaulting on their debts.

The Federal Reserve soothes the market every time something tiny happens with promises to ""be patient"" about rate hikes. Canada announced a few weeks ago out of the blue to drive rates down. 

Why do you all think that this is happening? As I've said, my theory is that the central banks are all still afraid of what tightening will do to the markets, but that seems a bit too simplistic. Even if that were the case, when will the strength of the economy allow for these rate hikes?",finance,1424992275

My first paycheck only covered a week's pay, and 25% of my income was taxed. I just received my second paycheck which covered two weeks, and it was taxed at 33%. This difference is significant enough to throw my whole budget out of balance. I'd love some guidance as to how to structure my budget here.

**My monthly expenses include:**

* RENT - 1075
* UTILITIES - 60
* CELLPHONE - 61
* FOOD - 305
* LOANS - 589
* TRANSPORT - 90
* GYM - 95
* *TOTAL* - 2275

My monthly income at the new, more heavily taxed rate is $3925.

According to the 50/30/20 rule, my necessary monthly expenses should only be around $1960, so I'm overpaying by $313. I don't think I'm overpaying for rent because the current amount is less than 30% of my income, which seems to be a healthy amount according to a few google results. I allow myself $10 a day for food, but I often spend less than that, and when I do eat out, I subtract that amount from my discretionary weekly allowance of $200. I also automatically dump 20% of each paycheck into a savings account for an emergency fund, which will take me an additional 11 weeks to accrue 3 months expenses, and 47 weeks to accrue 6 months. I think I'm going to stop at 3 months because I'm very eager to start paying down my student loans, of which I have ~$57,000 at various interest rates averaged around 6%.

I do get occasional overtime, but I intend to dump all of the extra money into my emergency fund and eventually into my student loans. I'm looking for side jobs that I can do on the weekends, but I also really value my free time and would rather not work more than 60 hours a week if I don't have to.

So my question is: Is my budget broken? If so, how can I adjust it? I have dreams of traveling and owning a vehicle, and I'd love to start investing in real estate or maybe start a side business, but I can't do any of those things until my student loans are payed off. $200 a week will take years to reach the capital necessary to do so.

Thanks in advance and I'd be happy to provide more data if necessary.

personalfinance,"Bank associate offering ""special rates""","Hello,  
  
I went to a bank recently to inquire about improving my interest rate on an account which had somehow dropped substantially.  Apparently, I was in luck-- to solve the problem, I was chosen for a personal consultation, and the consultant took me into their office.    They offered to open up a money market account for me that got ""special interest"".  Curious, I asked what that meant.  They shut the door, leaned over, and told me that there are ""a bunch of ways to game the system"".  For example, there were special interest rates for people who are fed up with a bank and going to remove their money.  If I kept calling back every 6 months and saying that I am going to cease to be a customer, then the bank would maintain the same high rate.  ""We do this for a lot of our customers-- they'll set phone alarms to remind them to call"".   Said consultant also told me that the branch manager frowns upon such things, so ""it would be our little secret"".  I was handed a promotional form, and I read the fine print.  It seems that the rates were only applicable on ""new money"".  I asked about how the rates would apply, seeing as it needed to be newly-deposited money and my money was simply being transferred.  They then told me that they would transfer the funds, but make it look new... by not closing my old account, and leaving it with a zero balance for a little while so it wouldn't have any red flags.  
  
In short, I walked away.  The idea of extra money is great, but this seems shady in my opinion.  I do appreciate someone trying to make things right for my low-interest snafu, but, in honesty, this makes me very hesitant to bank there.

personalfinance,I can't decide between renting or buying. Please help me make an informed decision.,"I'm a single parent in Philadelphia (full custody of pre-school-aged child) and I work full-time at a non-profit.

Right now I’m renting 2 bedrooms in a house (common living/kitchen/bath). I’m paying half the utilities although I’m never home to use them, among other problems.

Renting an actual apartment in my area is more expensive monthly than home ownership  (studio/1bdrm apartment between $700-$900 monthly in a safe neighborhood, plus utilities; a house worth about $100k would put monthly mortgage payments at about $500 plus PMI and taxes) but there can be unexpected and costly repairs that might come up in a house I own. 

Here’s all the necessary info:

Monthly income (after taxes/including child support/excluding healthcare and life insurance bc they’re taken from my paycheck):
$2600

Monthly Expenses:
Rent $500

Utilities $150

Groceries $300

TV/Internet $100

Federal student loan payment $200 (Total owed $70k @ 6.8% but I’m counting on PSLF)

Other student loan payment $104 (final payment in July 2015)

Child care: $600 (child will start kindergarten September 2016, this will become surplus if they go to public school, or I may need additional income to pay for private school, undecided at this time)

ONE Credit card $30 (minimum payment, $2800 balance/$3200 limit @ 0% interest)

Cell phone $50

Medical co-pays $105 (between $70 and $105 depending on the month)

Credit/identity monitoring $17 (absolutely a necessity)

Travel $95 (public transportation, no car)

Directly to savings each paycheck $155

Retirement $175

Netflix $8

Total Monthly Expenses $2539

Surplus $61 ($60 is technically allocated for “fun money” but I rarely do fun stuff every month or use the whole amount).

Current Savings $4160

I am currently working with a program that helps low/moderate-income, first-time homebuyers make smart decisions and get assistance with down payments and closing costs. I was told to save $2k to start the process of pre-qualification (and eventually pre-approval) to get the ball rolling toward homeownership via FHA loan.

personalfinance,"Finally have my first full-time job, wondering if there are any new options for checking/savings accounts","I just got my first full-time job, and I've got a good amount of money coming in now. My plan is to put 50% of my monthly paychecks towards expenses, 25% for emergency savings (then regular savings once I have 6 months worth of expenses saved), and 25% for paying back student loans.

My question is about what kind of checking accounts or savings accounts I can use now that I have real money coming in. Before now, I've always used a value checking and savings account from [C&amp;F Bank](http://cffc.com/home.aspx), which is a local bank in Virginia. I've been very happy with the customer service there, and I've banked with them my whole life. The only downside is that my checking account earns no interest, and my savings account earns 0.08% interest (which seems to be about average compared to savings accounts across the board). I'm glad that I can leave all my money with them all year, and get a free pack of gum at the end of the year for it. :)

Now that I'm not a student any more, are there any other options for bank accounts that would be more beneficial to me? Or are the interest rates so low across the board that it makes no real difference? Or should I look into getting something fancier than a savings account, like some sort of CD or investment account? I don't have that much of a lump sum to start with now, but I can always keep adding to it each month, with whatever option I end up going with.

And if it makes a difference, I wouldn't be using my bank accounts for anything more than receiving direct deposits, writing checks, paying off credit card bills in full each month, and having a place to hold money for me.

personalfinance,Federal student loan forgiveness for public service,"I work in the non-profit field and one of the perks of that, is that I can receive federal student loan forgiveness after making 120 payments while employed by either a non-profit organization or a government agency. I was aware of the program but hadn't really looked into it until recently, and I would imagine many of my colleagues are in the same boat.  Here is the most useful thing I found out:

Each of your employers has to fill out a form with all of their information--Employer ID Numbers and other tax info, address, etc.  They also record the dates you worked for them and the amount of hours that you worked per week during that time. Then an officer of that organization has to sign at the bottom certifying that A) you worked for them during the time period stated on the form and that B) they are either a non-profit or a government agency.  Then you submit it to your loan servicer and they determine whether or not the employer qualifies.

The reason I wanted to share this is that I don't qualify for loan forgiveness until 2023 at minimum.  God knows where my supervisors will be or if the organizations will even be around in 2023.  Who knows how long they're going to keep paperwork on me or if something will get lost.  A lot can happen in eight years. The DoE recommends having an employer fill out one of these forms every time you leave a job to make it easier on you.  

So my fellow government/non-profit employees, look into this program, and save yourself the hassle of having to track down ten year's worth of employers.  Here's a link to more [information.] (https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service)",finance,1425011847
technology,Message from Google Fiber,"TL;DR: Although a step in the right direction, it wasn't enough, it's just good enough. We need real competition. Thank FCC for the decision today.

---

Dear friends:

You may have heard that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just put in place rules to protect 'net neutrality.' That's big news.

But there was another important decision today to help keep the Internet competitive and open — and while it's getting less attention, it may be just as important.

As part of its agenda to encourage meaningful competition in high speed broadband for all Americans, the FCC supported allowing cities to make their own decisions about investing in new broadband networks. More needs to be done to drive innovation in bigger, faster broadband, but this is a good step.

[Share this graphic to thank the FCC and Chairman Tom Wheeler for their actions.](https://takeaction.withgoogle.com/page/content/thank-you-fcc/)

Thank the FCC for their critical action.

While the FCC's net neutrality rules can help prevent Internet access providers from relegating some applications to a ""slow lane,"" this move alone won't lead to a world where every consumer has an ultra fast connection to the entire Internet. That's going to take more competition and innovation in new broadband networks.

It's been nearly five years since we offered to build a fiber-optic network in one U.S. city as an experiment — and as we've expanded Google Fiber into a business, we've seen firsthand how faster speeds can improve lives and give cities new platforms for economic development.

Google is not the only one innovating in this area. Along with investments by other private providers, cities like Lafayette, LA and Chattanooga, TN have been investing in their own networks and developing public-private partnerships to that end.

Today, the FCC decided that it's important for users to be able to control their own Internet connections and for communities to make their own choices to suit their local needs for broadband. While it may not make sense for most governments to operate broadband networks themselves, we think faster, better broadband for all Americans is too important to remove an option for deployment.

Thank Chairman Wheeler and the FCC for supporting local choice and competition in broadband networks:

These glasses can even come with memory card slots so you can have a greater amount of memory and easily transfer footages to your computer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You do not need to be James Bond to own this stellar device.&lt;/b&gt; The use of the spy glasses comes down to one simple idea; if you need to record someone or something discreetly or hands free, then these glasses are for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the United States, it's not illegal to use a wearable spy camera to capture video especially in a public place.&lt;/b&gt; However, there are federal laws that inhibit regular civilians from recording audio without the other person's consent. This is why manufacturers of spy cameras do not include audio recording facilities into their products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video surveillance has suddenly become easier with the clear spy camera glasses.&lt;/b&gt; After you have charged your glasses for a few hours make sure your memory card is inserted fully, activate the recorder and place the glasses on your face. You are now recording full-color, full-motion, high-resolution surveillance video. Everything your head is pointed towards will be captured and stored to the memory card. This spy camera captures more than you see because the camera doesn't blink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nowadays, spy camera eyewear is widely use in solving criminal cases.&lt;/b&gt; Many people think that this gadget can only be seen in spy movies, like James Bond. Others think that these gadgets are very expensive and only security agents can afford Spy Camera Eyewear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Much like a spy camera smoke detector working on a WiFi camera system , spy glasses don't require any outside wires to function.&lt;/b&gt; All you need to capture hours of high-quality video is an SD card. Hidden camera glasses make a great gift for anybody who likes recording video on the go, but still needs to retain the use of their hands while doing so. Once you've captured your covert video, simply remove the SD card from your spy glasses or connect you glasses to your computer, transfer your videos, and share them with the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Popular with everyone from extreme sports enthusiasts to secret shoppers, spy camera glasses are a fun, low-cost way to record video on the go, hands free.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.spygearco.com/HighDefinitionSunglassesGLSunFL.htm"" target=""_new"" atomicselection=""true""&gt;&lt;img style=""margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px"" alt=""Glasses With Video Camera"" align=""left"" src=""http://www.spygearco.com/Images/MiniGadgets/4517_WEB.jpg""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These unique&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""http://www.spygearco.com/HighDefinitionSunglassesGLSunFL.htm"" target=""_blank""&gt;&lt;font color=""#0000ff""&gt;Glasses With Video Camera&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are right out of an action movie, featuring fully integrated DVR camera systems that allow you to record exactly what you see through your own eyes.&lt;/b&gt; Hidden camera glasses are different from a spy camera pen or a camcorder watch , because you won't arouse any suspicion when taping your subjects. Easy to use, spy glasses can begin recording with the push of a button. Spy sunglasses are a stylish way to record festivals, concerts, street scenes and much more. And they're great to wear when playing sports to capture all the action hands-free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div align=""center""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glasses With Video Camera: DEMO VIDEO&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div align=""center""&gt;&lt;iframe height=""300"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ReG4Ei07Mo?feature=player_embedded"" frameborder=""0"" width=""450"" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When duty calls these specs are ready to capture everything you see.&lt;/b&gt; Never worry about running out of memory again because this device uses Micro SD Cards. Transfer files to and from your computer easily with the included USB cable. If you want to have fun, get these spy glasses. The best advantage of using spy camera glasses as opposed to other spy devices is that they give you a close first person view and they're hands free.&lt;/p&gt;

* Gas: $50-75
* Cell phone: $85 (already cut this back from $105, can't go any lower. This is also already on a payment arrangement since it was due 2 weeks ago.)
* Title loan: $200 (loan amount was $700, something like 258% APR. You don't have to tell me how fucking stupid I was to do this, I already know but I was desperate.)
* Personal loan: $216 (remaining balance of $600. I can currently only afford the minimum payment.)
* Groceries/household goods: $100-150

In the early 90s, the oldest son of one family became the first to graduate high school. They scraped money together to get him to college, but in his first semester, they received a letter saying they had to pay $1300 or he would be kicked out in 48 hours.

&gt; ""In short, because this Order imposes intrusive government regulations that won't work to solve a problem that doesn't exist using legal authority the FCC doesn't have, I dissent.""

&gt; Americans love the free and open Internet. We relish our freedom to speak, to post, to rally, to 
&gt; learn, to listen, to watch, and to connect online. The Internet has become a powerful force for freedom, 
&gt; both at home and abroad. So it is sad this morning to witness the FCC’s unprecedented attempt to replace 
&gt; that freedom with government control. 
&gt; It shouldn’t be this way. For twenty years, there’s been a bipartisan consensus in favor of a free 
&gt; and open Internet. A Republican Congress and a Democratic President enshrined in the 
&gt; Telecommunications Act of 1996 the principle that the Internet should be a “vibrant and competitive free 
&gt; market . .  unfettered by Federal or State regulation.” And dating back to the Clinton Administration, 
&gt; **every FCC Chairman—Republican and Democrat—has let the Internet grow free from utility-style** 
&gt; **regulation. The results speak for themselves.** 
&gt; But today, the FCC abandons those policies. It reclassifies broadband Internet access service as a 
&gt; Title II telecommunications service. It seizes unilateral authority to regulate Internet conduct, to direct 
&gt; where Internet service providers (ISPs) make their investments, and to determine what service plans will 
&gt; be available to the American public. This is not only a radical departure from the bipartisan, market- 
&gt; oriented policies that have served us so well for the last two decades. It is also an about-face from the 
&gt; proposals the FCC made just last May. 
&gt; So why is the FCC turning its back on Internet freedom? **Is it because we now have evidence that** 
&gt; **the Internet is broken? No. We are flip-flopping for one reason and one reason alone. President Obama** 
&gt; **told us to do so.**

Bitcoin,"Is the US national ""debt"" an illusion?","I tend to agree with many of the forward-thinking viewpoints that are shared on Reddit. However, I feel there is misinformation being circulated regarding the US national debt. The core question that must be answered: What is the national wealth?

Private wealth in the US is almost $70 trillion. But dig deeper: What is the mineral wealth in our national parkland? What are the Rocky Mountains, Mendocino County, and ANWR worth? What is the aggregate oil wealth in public lands? What is the value of the US military in the jungle of international relations?

I argue that the $18 Trillion national debt pales in comparison to the national wealth of the United States. There is no better example of this than the revenue generated from Obama's successful energy exploration campaign.

When you take a look at the massive swaths of valuable land held by the federal government, it becomes clear that the total federally-owned real estate, oil, minerals, etc. within the borders of the USA could be valued in the quadrillions of dollars.

One thing has become increasingly clear to me: the United States HAS debt, but it is really not IN debt.

The purpose of the Federal Reserve is to govern the people through the money supply. The threat of hyperinflation or deflationary depression is exaggerated. The resource wealth of the United States - as well as the large, rich, taxable population - provides a backstop that keeps our currency strong, even in expansionary environments.

I believe this backstop is far more valuable than prior generations' use of precious metal reserves. I concede gold and silver are more tangible, but defining the national wealth by reserves of scarce metals is nothing more than a form of social brainwashing intended to keep resource-rich Americans feeling poor.

Conspiracy theorists and John Birchers who measure the national debt against gold reserves are engaging in monetary child's play. However, the Federal Reserve's ability to spend the past decade in crisis while hiding the money supply (M3) from the American public is brilliant. A brilliant scam that must come to an end in the United States, as it has in central banks throughout Europe and across the globe.

The strength of the dollar in FOREX markets in the wake of QE3 invalidates many conspiracy theories. As a market student and participant, I believe the dollar is legitimately strong and would remain strong through QE4, QE5, and QE6.

Is it time to end the myth of false scarcity? Is the easy answer - a dramatic increase in the debt ceiling to fund the Small Business Administration, Farm Service Agency, and regional banks - the best path for the US economy?

Recently an interesting statistic was released. The USA has fewer corporations today than 40 years ago, despite having three times as many citizens. If ""corporations are people,"" do we just need more ""people?""

Or is a multi-decade Japanese-style depression a better way to break the will of American men, break the daughters of the revolution into prostitution, seize American's weapons, and ultimately rejoin the British Crown and join the New/Old World Order?

I ask that question only half-sarcastically, because that appears to be the the intent of the current world order, and the path the Untied States is headed. Especially if either Hillary ""Forester de Rothschild-RHODam"" Clinton, or Jeb ""Lehman is now Barclays"" Bush are elected president.
This is serious business.

Sure, a new monetary system would be nice. But is a total revolution possible? Perhaps it is time to submit to reality, and finally admit that Reagan was right.

personalfinance,Privately held underwater mortgage with high interest rate. Anyway to refinance or modify?,"I've posted this elsewhere in the past, but never found any workable suggestions.  I'm hoping the larger /r/personalfinance community may have some better ideas.  

I'm trying to get my financial house in order, but one thing I can't change is my mortgage, that has higher than standard interest today, 6.85% on a 30 year mortgage. I owe about $98k today, 8 years in. My house is likely worth $70-80k (I don't want to pay for a real appraisal if there is little hope I can get a refinance done).

Here is my story: I bought my house in late 2006, just before the crash. I was rather under the gun as I had to meet a residency requirement from my job, and found a house that was well fixed up and mostly furnished, perfect for a guy just out of college, but a bit pricey. I only had 3% down as I only had a job for a few months. I went with a local savings and loan.

Fast forward a few years, and housing prices have dropped. I hear about HARP, but after talking to my bank, I find they kept my mortgage, as a privately held mortgage, it is ineligible. They also denied any request for modification, a denial that has been repeated multiple times.

I called the government's help line, and they suggested an FHA Short refinance. I asked my bank, and they don't participate (likely because it requires them to write off 10%).

So here I am, still paying high interest, but paying my mortgage on time. I had held out hopes for a HARP 3.0, but those hopes are gone with the new congress. But I'm tired of paying $100+/month in extra interest (or even keeping my payments but not paying it off sooner).

Does anyone else here have any other ideas on how I could get out of this high interest mortgage and one that is more in line with today's rates despite my situation, short of walking away?",finance,1425059719

personalfinance,"Starting a budget, looking for some advice.","Hello all. I came upon this thread last week and it has been very inspiring to me. 

1) I wanted to share the simple budget that I created. I am looking for some advice for areas of weakness. Maybe there are some things I am over budgeting and I don't recognize.

One hard part for me is that I get paid from my full time job once a month, on the last business day. My part time job (8 hours a week) is paid every two weeks. I also receive a mileage check each month, but the amount greatly varies.

I am trying to put 20% away into savings each month. I know the importance of the 3-6 month emergency fund, but I am getting married in May 2016 and I don't know how much (possibly all) of the wedding my fiance and I will be paying for. This budget is just my side of the finances. Right now I am putting all of my savings, 1200 current and about 20% net income per month into a money market account that is yielding 1%. Nothing great, but better than 0% is my thought process. I plan to use these savings in the event of an emergency, but then possibly deplete it fully for the wedding in May of 2016.

2) I am trying to follow what I have heard from the YNAB crowd of assigning every dollar a job. I have about $40 budgeted as not assigned right now. Should I leave this or fix it?

3) Also is YNAB worth the price of admission if I am already using a budget like this?

Also, my job has a pension plan and is automatically funded from my paycheck. I do not have any additional retirement savings accounts.

I have no carry-over Credit Card debt. Anything I put on a credit card is paid in that month.

I have just over $60,000 in student loans and about $9,500 owed on my vehicle.

My student loan payments are high because they consist of 40K in private loans and 20K in federal loans. I got the private loans in 2006 as a 17/18 year old with no knowledge of federal vs private anything.

4) I feel like I am not in a terrible position since I can put 20% of my income to savings, however, one of my concerns is if I am doing it right by saving the money for the wedding now or if I should stop saving for the wedding, only save for the emergency fund, and then pay down the student loans sooner once emergency fund is at 3 months and just possibly take a loan for the wedding. any advice here would be great.

Here is the budget I am using and the numbers I am using. If it isn't an atrocity and you want to use it as well, feel free.

financialindependence,Buying a home instead of renting (interest only mortgage),"One of the books on finance that I just finished reading raised a very interesting point in my mind.  I have always been put off by renting, by essentially throwing money away with 0 return so my question is this.

I would like any responses to remain at a high level please.  I realize this is an incredibly complex issue and depends on quite a few market factors so I'll try to lay out my assumptions.

Assume I pay 1,000/month + Utilities renting.  Instead of continuing this money black hole I get a mortgage that will be interest only.  0 Down payment.  (The interest rate does not matter)

The money that was used before will cover The mortgage+interest+small home repairs.  Basically assume a wash in terms of expenses, if you are having trouble this, just remember that the value of the home is flexible.

By owning a home I will now qualify for the mortgage interest tax deduction.  This effectively decreases my monthly ""rent"" payment by 25%.  The assumption here is that I itemize and I'm already beyond the standard deduction so I will gain 25% of every dollar in mortgage.

Also, I now have the option of renting out extra rooms in my house for additional cost (something that typically can not be done in an apartment)

I can remain in this home for as long as I would otherwise be renting and any appreciation can be taken as ""profit"" when I eventually sell.

Besides a decreasing value of the property, or a major repair that is needed, is there anything major I'm missing here?

Please don't point out things like ""you are going to have to pay for lawn care"".  I realize those are associated with owning a home vs living in an apartment, but I'm more interested in big picture here.

TL;DR:  Buying a home and making interest only payments instead of throwing away rent money every month.  What major problems can you see with this?

Thanks! (This is not something I'm necessarily considering doing, but would like some feedback)",finance,1425069661
personalfinance,"I did it. Grad school loans paid off 7 years, 10 months ahead of schedule. $38k in interest savings. Huge feeling of freedom right now. Drinking with my shirt off.","r/PersonalFinance, I have a success story to share.  Lurked, but never posted.  I went to grad school (MBA) 100% on student loans.  Graduated with shitloads of debt.   Bad interest rates, huge monthly payments.  But I made it a priority to pay these suckers off, and today I finally hit it.  $125k in debt to start, and balance is gone!!!!!!  I have my financial freedom back!!  Happy to answer any questions, but the biggest question - how - is knowing that any payments over the minimum make a HUGE difference, and don't give up.

Edit:  Trying to add some points on how.  I don't know how to work the internet so will probably mess up the line breaks.

Edit 2:  I can share my loan model (may or may not be helpful) if you PM me.


    A) I got a starting bonus at work....100% of it went to student loans

    B) I set a limit on my checking and savings account. I put money away for savings first, but any time I hit my limit, anything over that I put to loans.

    C) I actively participated in my companies stock purchase plan, which we buy at a discount. We get a 15% discount, so I maxed that out - 10% of my gross income. It hurt for one year, but after that year, I could sell off, quarter by quarter. I sold and put it all toward loans.

    D). I received starting stock options. When I could, I exercised, and put towards loans.

    E). I drove my grandmas (who, rest her soul, passed away) car for four years

    F) I lived with a roommate

    G) I aggressively consolidated and refinanced. In the end, I did it three times. This pushed down my interest rate. But every time I did, I sitll kept paying the same amount month by month - just kept hammering the interest

    H) I built a loan model so I could see the effect, in terms of time and money, exactly how much interest and time I was cutting out by paying off extra. This was more psychological than anything, but it made me realize - hey, $100 against $100k doesn't sound like much....but if you do it enough times...it matters.

personalfinance,Personal Loan from my TSP to pay off IRS and CC debt?,"Background:

30 years old, community college graduate, technical specialist in an Aeronautics related field.

I was laid off from my $60,000/year job last August.

Unemployment paid me $549 a week through the first week of January. I opted to not have taxes taken out.

I got a new job (same exact salary, 3400/month after taxes/contributions) in the second week of January.

Girlfriend is in school, works part-time, and makes between $800-$1000 a month after taxes.

The Dog brings in absolutely nothing, and is a total free-loader.

Our household monthly expenses total around 3,000 (Renting, two car payments, food, wine, pet expenses [freeloader!], etc.) We could definitely cut expenses by a lot, but we aren't hurting on our monthly budget and are adding to our savings at a decent rate.

The real question:

I have had about $7500 in 0% credit card terms for a while, planning on making payments as necessary to get them paid off before accruing interest, but not all at once since there's no need to wipe out my emergency fund. They would have been paid off by now but since I got laid off, i opted to keep my cash on hand in case something drastic happened. Well, now I'm working again, and cash on hand is easier to replace than it was, So i want to take care of it.

About $6000 of it is on 0% until NEXT January, with the remaining $1500 coming off 0% in August.

I just calculated my taxes, and I'm going to owe around $2000 because i didn't have taxes taken out of my unemployment.

We have about $6000 in cash between our bank accounts, but I'd rather not take her money to pay off my credit cards, plus she doesn't make much and it would take her much longer to replace it. I'd rather she keep her savings. I have about $3500 in my own bank accounts after the massive depletion from five months unemployed.

I have a federal TSP, (the rules of which seem really awesome as far as pre-tax contributed accounts go) which i can borrow $7500 from and pay myself back over five years at low interest. The interest goes back to ME though, much preferable to paying a credit card.

My thinking right now is to borrow the $7500 from myself, Pay the IRS, and put the rest toward credit cards, leaving me with about $2000 in debt with 11 months to pay it off before accruing interest. The total monthly impact on bills will be around $330/month ($130 pretax, $200 from net) for the first 11 months and $130 (Pre-tax) for the next 49.

I don't know the impact on my TSP retirement account, but I can imagine that the average return rate over those five years would be more than the 2.9% APR I'll be paying myself. I could even compensate by contributing extra to the TSP.

It seems like I can effectively pay my tax and credit card debt with pre-tax income and leave my emergency savings in the bank while paying interest to no one but myself. Am I looking at this wrong?",finance,1425074700

In the past few years the share price was depressed due to uncertainty regarding the relationship with Air Canada, and whether a new agreement wold be signed.

In January, a new 10 year agreement was signed, as well as new union agreements, which according to the company would ensure the dividend could be maintained. Following this news the price rose during late January and early February. Last week the company announced their strong Q4 results, and unexpectedly increased the dividend. Since then the share price has fallen 6%. Based on today's close and the value of the increased dividend (coming in April), the yield is 8.63%. This seems absurdly high in the current low interest rate environment, when considering that all indications suggest this dividend is safe for 10 years (short of significant unforeseen circumstances). I'm complete at a loss for why the share price isn't significantly higher, given that other popular income producing equities trade in a range of 4-5% yields.

personalfinance,I just quit smoking and I'd like to be a millionaire someday.,"So, here is my question.

I always hear people say, ""if you didn't smoke, you'd be a millionaire by the time you were old enough to retire."" And, what they mean is if you put that 5 dollars (or 10 or whatever) a day into an account that earned compound interest, by the time you were 55 or 60 years old, you would have earned enough to be a millionaire.

What I'd like to know is what kind of account would allow you to do this without eating you alive in fees. I mean, if we're talking stocks, there are commission fees for buying and selling. You can't just buy 50 or 100 dollars of any stock at a time because it doesn't make sense to when you're paying $7.95 to buy and $7.95 to sell. If I put it into a savings account, I'm getting such bogus interest rates that I might as well just stash the money under my mattress.

Got word today my bonus is coming and I need some help determining my 401k contribution changes, if any. I have until tomorrow to make the change. My CPA is out of town until Monday. :/

I contribute 14% of my pay to my 401k. Company match is 100% up to 6%. In November or so, I'll hit the $18k limit with just my monthly salary contributions. If I do nothing, 14% of my bonus will also go into my 401k which will make me hit the $18k limit earlier in the year. My questions:

* Is there a tax benefit to increasing my contributions to 25% for the bonus pay period? Bonuses are withheld at 25% Fed and ~9.5% for CA state. I'd imagine less would be withheld but is it a wash in the end?
* If no to the above, should I reduce my 401k contributions to ~3% which would make the contribution roughly inline with my 14% contribution to keep my contributions on steady and on par with other months? This would theoretically increase the amount withheld for taxes.
* Do nothing. Contribute my 14% from my normal pay and 14% of my bonus to 401k. 

I read on a website (http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/01/13/the-big-401k-match-mistake/) that contributing a larger amount up front could be detrimental w/r/t the employer match, but it doesn't explain why and the lightbulb hasn't lit up in my head yet.

EDIT: Added verbiage from the plan documents regarding employer contributions.

Employer Matching Contributions
You have an added incentive to save for retirement — employer matching contributions. The Company will contribute an amount equal to 100% of the first 6% of Eligible Pay you contribute each pay period as tax-deferred contributions. At the end of the calendar year, the Company will make an additional matching contribution, only if necessary to ensure that your matching contributions for the calendar year equal 100% of up to the first 6% of Eligible Pay contributed as tax-deferred contributions for the calendar year.

Please note that employer matching contributions will be applied to tax-deferred contributions, but will not apply to after-tax contributions, rollover contributions, or catch-up contributions (as described in the section of this SPD entitled “Catch-up Contributions”.

No employer matching contributions will be paid on the tax-deferred contributions that exceed 6% of your Eligible Pay or on Eligible Pay from which no contributions are made to the Plan.",finance,1425081457

However, I put in all my Michigan stuff in turbo tax first. Sweet I'll get about $2000 back. Then I entered my California stuff expecting I get some back from that as well, and my estimated return dropped from around $2000 to $1000 and I owe a small amount to each state. So that was a bit depressing. (Return amount that decreased is the Federal return by the way)

I could see where maybe in CA they didn't take out enough taxes because I was in a lower tax bracket before if you just take into account the money from my internship.

My move to MI was paid for by my company and they provided money to get myself settled in, etc. So this all was all included in my gross income. So my income was about $47k in MI and $10k in CA, I think I'm in the same tax bracket regardless if the amount was $47k or $57k. It is the part time residency that messed it up for me?

Also my new job in MI provided an HSA which I used on medical expenses. But it looks like this was added as taxable income in my CA state return, I don't understand that. Isn't the whole point of an HSA to have untaxed funds for medical uses?

~~Last question. On my CA return they seem to take into account all of the money earned in 2014, not just the portion that was in CA. Why is this the case?~~

Edit: I just took a second look and will include this in my original post. So it listed my federal adjusted income as the full amount and the CA amount is ""Income After Nonresident Adjustment"". The amount actually does look correct, so that was my mistake. However, there is a line called ""Plus: California Additions"" which is the same amount as my HSA. It is hard to tell if the nonresident adjustment includes or excludes this amount. Turbo Tax Q&amp;A says that Plus: California Additions could be income items that were non-taxable on the federal return, that are taxable on the California. So maybe my HSA is taxable in CA which sound weird.

I used turbo tax just so you know. Taxes can get really complicated, especially for those of us who are young and new to the full time work force. So I thought you all would have more insight into why it came out like this.",finance,1425088913
personalfinance,Advice on my financial situation,"I'm 24 years old and just landed a new job. The company offers 401k matching up to 6% as well as being an employee owned company by virtue of providing stock in the company as a benefit. I currently make about 27k starting out, am hourly, and still live at home with the parents for now. My main question concerns my motorcycle loan I currently have. It's a 2 year loan at 3% for $2200 total and I owe about $1500 on it still, which comes out to about $97-100 a month. My current goal is to get $2000 together as a down payment on a new car which will hopefully be a 4 year loan, around the same interest rate as my bike, for a $10,000ish car, making my payments around $150-200ish a month. After I get the down payment together for the car, I'm going to focusing on saving money for a down payment on $70k-$100k house to move out into. 

My question is, once I setup the loan for my car, should I go ahead and pay off the motorcycle loan as quickly as possible or would it be more beneficial for my credit to not pay off the loan until the full two years are up? The loan officer I spoke to for my motorcycle seemed to indicate that it would be better for my credit to continue making the minimum payments and make the loan last for the full two years but at the time that wasn't taking into account that I would be getting another loan for a car as well as saving for a house. If it helps at all, all my loans will be through my local credit union.",finance,1425094033

Bitcoin,My Passion (feedback appreciated),"Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer decentralized value transfer protocol. It is the Internet of money. It is the marriage of transparency with privacy. I can send you 10 cents or 10,000 dollars in a text message, an email, or a QR code. Wealth can be coded into a drawing, a song, a radio transmission, or simply written onto a piece of paper. Money is now a content type. The medium is not the message. Bitcoin as a store of value transforms tangibility into thin air. Using Bitcoin, you can send any almost amount of money anywhere in the world almost instantly, for a transaction fee of a few pennies. Even less in some cases. No other monetary system in the world currently allows for this.

This technology that Bitcoin is built on is called the blockchain. The blockchain is a distributed public ledger, maintained by a millions of users across the globe electronically. This computational capability is so large, you could combine all of the fastest super computers in existence, and they would still be thousands of times less capable than the blockchain network. In fact, the fastest super computer in the world is the blockchain network. A transaction is created and injected into the network, e.g. (someone sends you one US dollar worth of BTC), and that transaction is then publicly verified and published to the blockchain on cryptographic consensus. 

Once the transaction is published, no one can reverse, alter, counterfeit, or double spend it, because doing so would require that entity to input false information faster than half of the nodes on the network. Due to the blockchain’s decentralization, it would be impractical and prohibitively expensive to even try. Besides, it’s a public ledger, right? I can prove to anyone that I send you that dollar, because EVERYONE on the network gets a copy of the receipt for that transaction. If someone tried to inject a fraudulent transaction in an attempt to claim, ""No he did not."", the network would kick it back and say, ""Yeah, well, millions of other users on the network have verified the transaction, and consequently we all have it on a verified record that he did."" Transactions on the blockchain are irreversible and permanent. The ledger is recorded in pen, not pencil. 

This may seem startling at first, because what if you sent money to the wrong person? That is the beauty of it. Bitcoin is programmable money. You can design different transactions the same way you decide what to make for supper during the week. You can add multiple elements to a payment, and prepare them per you taste or needs. What works for some applications, does not work best for others. With Bitcoin, you can program your protections and requirements into the transaction itself.

Once the network verifies a transaction, it is then packaged with other transactions into a type of digital information ""block"". Those blocks of transactions are then ""chained"" together in sequence, hence the blockchain. The network then goes on to utilize the math / cryptographic data established in these blocks as a type of continuous empirical root value data point used in the computational equations and verification of subsequent transactions. The answer is based on the answer is based on the answer, etc. Think of how a physical chain works. A link is linked to link, etc. To go backwards in the blockchain to try altering something means that the all of the math used to verify the preceding blocks would be invalidated. Transactions are therefore un-falsifiable.
 
The blockchain network creates security through employing enormous calculations of numbers in the quindecillions. The calculations utilized are easy to do in one direction, but basically impossible to perform in the reverse. Any attempt to ""hack"" these one-way function mathematics, would require years of sustained computational power, at which point you could, in theory, re-write or double spend ONE transaction on ONE of these blocks, at which point the system would kick the attacking node off of the network, and pick up where it left off on the previous block. There is not enough metal on the earth to even build the computers required to even attempt something like this, let alone go unnoticed for years. Not even the projected developments in quantum computing come close to how large these numbers are.

This network is described at ""trustless"". Current transactional systems require a ""trusted third party"". Banks, insurance companies, notaries, and brokers all perform the function of mitigating counter party risk, by doing the “trusting”, for us. Since two parties involved in a transaction can't necessarily trust each other, these third parties bare the risk, and basically rob us blind for the service. This could be illustrated in thinking of how insurance actually works in practice. Generally, the insurance company is trying fraud you, and in turn you try to fraud the insurance company. Or put another way, you want them to pay out a much as possible, while they try to pay out as little as possible. They don’t trust you anymore than you trust them. The riskiness measured in value of this trust, in part determines your premiums. This reasoning can be applied to most “if x, then y” contracts of any sort.

With the blockchain, we no longer need to trust one sole party, or any party for that matter. This trust is inherently “built in” to the network’s code through cryptographic consensus, and creates even further confidence by using a hardened, tamper-proof, ""proof of work"" formula. This provides the transacting parties absolute assurance that the agreement will be, or has been upheld; all without the need for these trusted third parties. And remember, we can program arrangements and conditions into a blockchain transaction. We are now free to be our own banks or insurances companies if we choose to be. Please understand, we are not erasing the market for trusted third parties agreements, we are simply giving ourselves more options. As a consumer, what is more valuable than options?

The blockchain is independent of any policy governments might impose, a bank's liquidity, or it’s standards of practice. It runs parallel to sovereign fiat currencies, along with the ""good faith"" of its issuance. The fractional reserve dollar is backed by debt and war, among other things. The US government is in essence a giant insurance company to the American public stating, ""Trust us. We “promise” that your money will be good tomorrow, and Federal Reserve's manipulation of interest rates and the money supply is necessary to protect us from the threat of another Great Depression.""

But we don't have to trust the promises of these institutions anymore. We trust math. We no longer depend on currencies backed by the good faith and policy of governments, we now have currency backed by arithmetic. It’s correct or it’s not. There are no opinions or biases on the blockchain. We are not taking it on faith that the ledger is what a government or a corporation says it is, because our numbers are published for the world to see. What is Bitcoin backed by? It is backed by the largest decentralized network/super computer in existence, and in effect, the common good it’s users.

The old ways are done for. This technology cannot be un-invented. And Bitcoin is just the first application of the blockchain technology. There are numerous implications for a staggering variety of uses. Some big ones being voting, remittances, smart contracts, ID services, insurance, loans, property titles, crowd-funding, micro-transactions, information security, and information leaks.

There are definitely some complexities as to how the system runs under the hood, but don't be overwhelmed. Most people though the early Internet was too complicated as well, and lacked usability for the average user, and applications for usage are still being developed to this day. Soon you won't have to look at funny numbers or addresses, any more than the average Internet users needs to look at IP addresses. We still use them; they are just hidden under a veneer of usability. This is only the 6th year of this technology. You should have no doubts that it will be refined.

This future is so fundamentally different than how things work now, that it is crazy to think about. People all over the world will now have the means to control they’re own wealth. “With great power, comes great responsibility.” Even with cash, we don't actually control our own money. Bitcoin's most similar analog is gold. But how do you secure gold besides a vault? How do you divide gold to pay for a home, or a coffee? Most people today likely wouldn't want to be in charge of their own money, and that's fine, but the direction we are moving in really is revolutionary. 

It may not seem pertinent to those of us in first world nations, but think about the people who aren't afforded the privileges we enjoy… People that live in countries that have no institutional trust or financial security. Or where there is no infrastructure for these services anyway. Where voting or transacting the wrong way could get you persecuted, disappeared, or murdered. To them this technology brings hope. We can have safety through anonymity; growth through diffused liquidity; and greater collective power through open and growing networks. This is technology has the potential to pull a lot of people out of helplessness and poverty. It’s a modern economic Bill of Rights for the citizens of world; for the billions of people who have been ostracized and not afforded a chance to enter the global economy.

The network is borderless and independent, free from the fetters of those who would use the free market to exploit human beings. Nationless, fair, and equitable, with the blockchain comes the opportunity to bring peace and prosperity to those who have been excluded. It's human law, if there were such a thing. And no entity or authority can transgress against or thwart these rights. The compliancy is built in. The playing field has been leveled. Put succinctly, it's on.

NOTE** Any corrections, flaws, or points to be made would be much appreciated. I feel like writing about it helps me understand more clearly, and I would like to be more fluidly articulate when discussing it with others.

I know I have no post history or credentials here. I've just been a lurker inspired by a lot of people in this community. I really want to contribute somehow, so this how I will try to kick it off. I'm not one of the bright minds behind the development, and these are not all my words and ideas; credit is due elsewhere. I'm just trying to build an understanding of what this technology means for helping people in clear, easy-to-understand write up.

personalfinance,"401K myths I often see in print -- the utility of 401K vs non-tax deferred investments, and borrowing from 401K. Please point out where I am mistaken.","It seems like I keep running across certain statements regarding 401K funds which, while on the surface seem legit, they don't seem to stand up to scrutiny when you put actual numbers behind them.

Myth 1: The fact that money goes into a 401K plan pre-tax doesn't really do you any good, since you have to pay taxes on it when withdrawing it.  Therefore, with the exception of the amount that is matched by your employer, you are no better off investing further money in 401K than through other non-tax-deferred investment channels.

My analysis: In this analysis, I'll use the following assumptions.

1) You make 50K a year and are single, therefore you are in the 25% tax bracket, and state tax is 3%, for a total of tax of 28% for every dollar you make over $36,900 (and under $89,350).

2) Your 401K contribution is 10%, or 5K a year pre-tax.  This represents an actual amount of 3600 a year that you actually see missing from your paycheck due to the tax savings (this figure is used in the second part of the analysis).

3) That 5K is contributed for 10 years, at a 5% return on investment compounded annually.  At the end of 10 years, you have $66,033.  Assuming you withdraw 50K annually after retirement, all from 401K funds and you have no other income, your total tax rate annually is 11.4% (8.4 from federal, 3% state, based on 2014 tax tables), or $7528.  So the after tax funds that was added to your 401K is $58,505, or a gain of $8,505 by using 401K as your investment vehicle.

For comparison:
4) Here, we will invest $3600 a year (the figure from (2) above -- the part that we see ""missing"" from our paychecks), for 10 years, in a regular investment fund that again earns 5% interest, which is taxable.  The annual tax rate on the interest 28%, as this is money on top of your regular income so it is in the higher tax bracket from (1) above.  This gives you $43,956 at the end of 10 years.  A total of $14,549 less then what you would have gotten from the 401K route above.

Note: the tax on investment interest may be less, if computed using a capital gains formula.  If assuming no taxes at all on interest, that leaves $47,544 after 10 years, or a $10,961 shortfall when compared to the 401K route.

Myth 2: Borrowing from 401K is a bad idea, as you are borrowing pre-tax dollars and paying it back with after tax dollars, and then you still pay taxes when you withdraw at retirement.  Therefore you get double taxed.

My analysis: Money is fungible, so a particular dollar doesn't know if it was pre-tax or post-tax.  Not that it really matters, but lets consider that you borrow $10,000 from your 401K account, put it in your checking account, then you pay that same $10,000 back the next day.  Your 401K account has essentially the same amount in it afterwards, and your end of year tax bill is the same amount (you don't claim the 10K borrowed as income, so you don't pay taxes on it -- and you pay the exact same 10K back, which is the pre-tax money that you just withdrew from your 401K).

Now realistically, you won't be paying that 10K back the next day -- most likely you will be using it to buy a car for example, and paying that back over the course of 3 years, at something like 4% interest.  So even though you are paying it back with ""post tax"" dollars, you just bought that car with pre-tax dollars that your withdrew from your 401K, for an effective savings of 28% on the car purchase!  So the two do balance out.  The only money that you will get double taxed on is the interest, which the 401K fund just sees as growth no different than if it was sitting in a low-risk fund returning 4%.  And your personal finances sees that 4% you are paying out as no worse off than paying a bank 4% (or more likely 6 - 8%), and most of that 4% (minus the taxes on this amount) you will get back at retirement.

The only two drawbacks I can see for a 401K loan, when you are otherwise faced with getting a bank loan, is that money could be making more return on investment if it was left in the 401K fund for the 3 years (or it could have been losing money too, depending on how risky the investments it would have been sitting in -- remember 2008?).  And secondly, if you lose your job, you will have to repay the balance of the loan within 60 days (but if you switch jobs, you can roll the rest of your 401K balance into the new company's plan, and re-borrow against that to pay off the original loan).  Oh, and some people will chose to reduce their 401K contribution percentage to make up for the loan payments, but they would have most likely done the same thing if borrowing the money from a bank too.",finance,1425098389
personalfinance,"How to best invest after ""tax-free"" options are used up?","I'll try to summarize my issue concisely.  

I make greater than 200k per year.  
I max out my work retirement (~20% of salaray)

I max out my HSA.

I have 180k in school loans at ~2.0% interest.

Where do I go next?  Do I pay of the student loans? House? Put money in taxed mutual fund accounts?  

I seem to be out of tax-free options and am hesitant to pay of loans that are for the most part lower than inflation.  The mortgage rate is the highest but that is essentially discounted by 50% to 2.4% once you account for tax savings on the interest (35% federal taxes, 12% state).

So here is the break down, I'm 26 male, single no dependents, self employed ~150k annual income, truck was paid off, owns a house renting out suites which covers my mortgage+utilities+landtax+usual household needs. no student loans. 

My expense per month including: gas is about $300. food $500. clothing $50. cellphone: $56. Gym $40. entertainment $400. Commercial, vehicle, WCB insurance $180.  Total roughly around $1500.

Monthly income about $10,000- $15,000 it varies a bit since I'm a contractor, so I can save 5 figures per month easy.

I have invested a decent amount into RRSP and TFSA mutual funds, pretty much all growth for RRSP and aggressive for TFSA. I have mixed feelings about real estate investments, since I'm usually too busy at work or out of town, so I can't really take care of properties personally. On top of that the real estate market at where I'm at is really bullish atm, so I don't think its a good time to buy despite low interest rates.

In fact I just signed up moment ago to ask this question. Anyhow, just like to title of the post, I have 5k sitting in my checking account that I don't plan on using.

I opened up a ROTH IRA with Vanguard last November and contributed 3k. I was planning to either max it out(5.5k) ROTH IRA for year 2014 and with remaining of 5k, divide them and contribute to ROTH IRA for 2015 or into ROTH IRA for 2015.

Notice ""was planning""... I'm unsure of my decision after I found about 3% APY CD with 12-month term(3k maximum balance) from Navy Federal Credit Union. Opening an account won't be a problem.

So here are possible three choices that I can think of with 5k.

1. Max ROTH IRA 2014, and remaining into ROTH IRA 2015.
2. Do not max ROTH IRA 2014 and invest into that of 2015.
3. 3k into CD, rest into 2015 ROTH IRA.

I have:

1.5k in ROTH TSP.  
3k in ROTH IRA.  
2k in saving.  
no student loan.  
no debt.  

Is CD worth it? Or is it too ""un-risky"" for a college student? Is it the way to go since it offers 3%? I need some advice. What do you guys think? Thanks.",finance,1425114121

 Currently I'm sitting at 70k in private loans and 30k in federal loans. I'm a Naval Officer making 5000k a month after taxes. Currently, I have a car loan with 12k remaining. I have credit cards but no major debt on them. I have roughly 6k in my savings account and 12k in investment accounts (between TSP ROTH IRA, a private civilian IRA, and some stocks(&lt;500 bucks there!). 

As of right now, I am paying using my own custom built plan: 

- Car loan is 449/month, I pay that plus an additional 300 to principle. The car is ~new, 2011 Subaru WRX with low milage (30k). I will be deployed at least one more time for ~10 months so the car will have under 50k by the time my contract is up 3-4 years from now. 

- 95% of my federal loans (all capped at 6% due to SCRA) are subsidized and I am not required to make payments on them (active duty) so I have NOT been paying anything towards the 30k except the minor interest gained each month from the 2 Un-sub loans. 

- For the private loans (All capped at 6% interest due to SCRA), I started at about 100k in debt, and have been paying 1,800 dollars a month towards them leaving me at 69,000 right now. 

- For savings, I put 200 dollars/month into my TSP IRA, nothing into my private IRA, and nothing into my savings or stocks. I have decided to STOP all savings at this point, I feel comfortably padded in terms of emergency money, and my job security is stable. 

- Once my car is paid off (12 months) I will be putting all of the 450+300 towards my private loans, bumping that payment up which will result in paying off the federal loans is ~2.8 years! After that, I will take off of that money and move it towards my federal loans, which would take 13 months to pay off those. At that time, I will be at the end of my Naval ""contract"" and will be debating job changes. However, I will be OUT OF DEBT, have the GI Bill to go back to school (I already have a M.S. in engineering), and will be financially able to do whatever I want (No car payment, no student loans)!

So everyone, what do you think about this? Am I dumb not putting something into savings? All of my loans are 6% interest, which I figure is tough to have savings making MORE than 6% unless it is a higher risk. My current plan is based on get out of debt ASAP and start major savings in ~3 years. Also, I'm 28 years old.

I'd like to put my tax refund toward reducing debt. I've done a comparison between the avalanche and snowball methods, and it seems that avalanche is the way to go for me. My question is that the debt with the highest interest rate  (a student loan) is currently is deferment. I'm not sure if I should put the money into that loan or if I should go to the next highest interest rate loan which is in repayment currently. My entire goal is to pay the least amount of interest over time, not necessarily to have fewer sources of debt overall.

Buy a house (around June)  
Purchase a used car (ASAP)

personalfinance,"$270,000 in SL Debt, High Income. How's our situation?","Hi all,

My fiancé and I (both late 20's) both recently finished grad school and have reached the point where we're comfortable in our jobs and are starting to plan for the future. However, we have a slightly unusual situation in that we have a massive amount of student loan debt but also relatively high incomes. 

We're looking at buying a new car in the next few months and a home in 2016, and I'm basically wondering if we're in a situation to consider a new car or home and just how good or bad our situation really is. This sub has been very helpful reading so I'm hoping for a realistic outside opinion on our situation. 

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

~$270,000 in federal student loan debt. 6.5% IR on most, 7.5 on some. All loans on IBR. 

No other debt

$36,000 401k 

$45,000 cash emergency fund/future down payment 

$30,000 taxable investments

INCOME 

$280,000 gross annual salary + ~10% bonus at year end. Salary should increase about $30,000 per year at our current jobs. 

$13,500 monthly salary net of tax, health insurance, and max 401k contributions. This does not include bonuses, most of which go to loans or investment.

EXPENSES

Our monthly budget ends up around $9,000 in total expenses per month. This includes $4,000 in student loan payments, which is more than our minimums on the IBR plan. It also includes a monthly value of any annual budget expenses, such as travel. 

That leaves about $4,500 that either goes to savings towards a down payment in cash or investment accounts, or can be put towards high IR loans. 

QUESTIONS

We're considering two major purchases in the next year:

NEW CAR

We both need cars to get to work. Both of our current cars are fully paid off. Our newer car is a 4 year old small suv. Runs well and gets reasonable gas mileage. Our older car is a 15 year old large SUV. Probably worth about $4k. Gas mileage is about 16 mpg in a daily 1.5 hour/25 mile round trip commute. 160,000 miles. No major engine or transmission problems, but needs new tires, brakes, and suspension to get through a few more years if the engine and trans holds out. 

We're considering trading in the older suv for a new small hatchback around the $25-$29k range. We'd probably end up financing about $20-$22k at around 1-2% for 3 years. We obviously have the cash flow to handle the increase in payments, but is it unreasonable to take on the additional debt?

HOME PURCHASE

We currently rent for $1700 a month. The only additional cost is ~75 per month in utilities. We'd like to buy a home about one year from now when our lease expires. I think we can have about $100,000 down payment saved by that point without totally raiding our emergency fund. That would be around 20% on the houses we're looking at. 

Are both of these purchases within reason at our debt and income levels? I've recently taken a greater interest in our finances after realizing that paying off our debt is actually a reasonable possibility, and don't want to make any mistakes.",finance,1425136690

I put money for short term savings goals in a separate account from my emergency fund. And lastly my discretionary spending goes in it's own account.

personalfinance,Taxes more complicated this year - am I doing it right?,"I'm in college, and in the past, my taxes have been as simple as inputting W2s and I'm done. This year, it got a little more complicated.

I'm from NY but go to school in MA. I've always filed as a NY resident making money in MA because I lived in a dorm. However, last May, I moved off campus and actually consider myself living in MA. In November, I turned 21 and converted my license from NY to MA.

Also, in 2013, I worked a job during the spring and fall semesters that withheld taxes and gave me a W2. However, in the summer, I interned for a startup that did not withhold taxes and received a 1099-MISC. When I put it all into Turbo Tax, it said that I get a bit of a refund for MA taxes, but owe about $200 in Federal to make up for not paying taxes on my 1099.

When I got to the state section, I said that I lived in NY until May then moved to MA. It asked if I made money in MA while living in NY, and I said yes, which is true. Suddenly my MA tax refund jumped over $100. Obviously, I'm not complaining, especially since I now get more of a refund from MA than I owe for Federal. But is this right? Should making money in MA while living in NY make that much of a difference in my refund?

Also, another question in case anyone has been in a similar situation - MA has a form called 1099 HC that is sent to prove on your taxes that you have health insurance that meets MA standards. I'm on my father's health insurance in NY, so I never received that form, but I do meet the standards. Can I just call my insurance company to get the necessary info for my taxes?",finance,1425141985

GF and I obviously want kids, but not for quite some time. We both have pretty good careers going for us and want to enjoy the rest of our 20's before bringing anything else into this world.

personalfinance,"[Long post] Need to cut the cord. Financial, relationship, and other issues involved.","I am really starting to question the financial relationship I have with my family (99.9% my dad, actually).  



My dad has a big heart, and growing up he always helped us out financially.  First it was the cell phone, then when I got my license he also paid my (and my brothers') insurance.  I lived off of loans in college, but when they'd run out at the end of the semester he'd give us money.  After graduating, I moved back home which he does not have a problem with.  He charges me nothing.  But he also always said, ""you will need some help making student loan payments after you graduate so I'll deal with those.""  So at this point, he is paying my insurance, cell phone, and pretty much all of my school loans.  He lets me stay here and eat for free.  Really, my only expenses are work lunches and gas.  Big problem is I get bad gas mileage w/my vehicle (which I own free &amp; clear), and have a long commute so I spend about $400/month on gas.  Here's where the problem starts.  I have a job with huge earning potential, but it is mainly commission.  The reason more people aren't in the industry is because they don't have the flexibility to basically be broke for the first few months/years.  Thanks to not having other expenses, however, I've been able to stick with it.  I'm finally getting past the early/broke stages of my career and it's been great having money at the end of the month to put towards my savings/emergency fund as well as being able to contribute to my 401k.  Here's where the problem(s) start...



My dad isn't actually that good with money, but he likes being in control of it.  He is has been running up debt, mostly in his name (as a $200k HELOC on our house) and the credit is tapped out.  I know supporting me and my 2 brothers is a burden, but I still have trouble seeing where some of the money is going, and would just like to cut the cord and be done with it all.  Between him and his wife (my stepmom), I estimate that they make $100k/year before taxes.  And our family also owns land which we rent, and it's good for another $50k/yr.  He holds that HELOC over our heads.  He used it to ""pay off"" my brother's and my own student loans because the interest rate was lower.  The other things on the HELOC are some remodeling, other debs my dad had, and some toys he bought after he got remarried (which is really when this all started). Basically, he keeps telling us that he's not making enough to pay his bills.  My brother is in the middle of a settlement where he may get any where from 250-500k, and my dad is trying to set it up so that money will pay everything off then that brother will get the 50k rental money every year till he's paid back. I don't like that one bit.  I am the only one telling my brother ""Hey, you deserve that money and don't let anybody else tell you what to do with it.  Dad &amp; everybody else will survive with out it.  You never know what the future will bring and you have no idea you'll actually ever get it back.  I don't hold you liable for paying back MY student loans.  If you want, I will go with you to a  financial advisor and he will tell us what's best and I'll support it 100% even if the rest of the family hates you.""



So back to me- I've been doing real well at my job and my income is increasing, but more importantly I've been living frugal.  My dad who has joint access to my account just gets wide eyes every time he sees my accounts online.  Last week he tells me, ""the yearly rent is going to be due for our lot at the lake and I don't think I'm going to have the $ so you may have to help.""  Then he sees that I'm going to get $1500 for my tax refund and says ""I'll just use that since you won't notice the money you don't have yet, then I'll pay you back when we get the settlement money.""  That frustrates me because: 
1.) I did have plans for that money- to put towards my emergency funds
2.) The way my dad wastes money, I know he could make that payment just by cutting back other un-necessary expenses.  
3.) I don't have a right to say ""no"" since I know my dad has helped me in the tune of much more than $1500 in the past, and is still ""helping"" with student loans/insurance/etc.
4.) My other brother (not the one in school still, getting a settlement) doesn't make an income because of laziness and the fact he won't work if it's not his dream job.  He graduated college, tried one job (which was a scam) and then quit and decided to go back to school online (still unemployed).  So he wasn't asked to help.  And I just feel like I'm the one pulling his weight too.
5.) If my dad is so broke, then why doesn't he give up the trailer at the lake?  Sure it would suck, but that's life.  There are ALOT of other things just like this, too, for example his ""winter 4wd vehicle in case the weather gets bad.""  He pays insurance on that Jeep, but doesn't want to get it dirty and it hasn't left the garage for over a year.  Didn't even use it when we were snowed in last year.  So sell it, or at least take it off insurance right?



I would really like to just cut the cord and wipe my hands of the family's finances completely.  I will never feel like I'm really succeeding until I'm making my own way 100%.  While my commission at work is getting higher every month, it's still scary thinking about making my loan payments, insurance payments, rent, and other living expenses.  I'm not even sure if I'd be able to make all those payments, but I definitely wouldn't be able to put money back into savings.  And as you can see, the way it is now, even if I do get money saved up then it's just a matter of time until my dad has to borrow it because he can't manage money very well.  So having extra money right now will always ""come with a grain of salt.""  Atleast if my dad wasn't helping me anymore, I could tell him ""well your expenses were cut due to not having to pay for me anymore.""  I feel pathetic being 26 years old and not having financial independence yet.  And I know it will just be a mess getting my loans back in my name, because they are wrapped up with other loans now in my dad's name (what portion belongs to me?  My brother? What portion is paying back the remodels to the house my stepmom just *had* to have?).  My dad is not a bad person, but he is a control freak.  And he can also be very very manipulative (think: guild trips) when he believes he is doing the right thing.  When I help him out, I never know how much of that is repayment for what he's done for me and how much is just getting him out of trouble for his poor decisions.  When I consider his and his wife's income, I don't see how they don't have several THOUSAND left at the end of each month, let alone come up short for their bills.  But he does not let anyone else in on the family finances.  I'm still not sure there's not something fishy going on where he is secretly spending a lot of money (he's always had a pill problem, but it's always been what he could get from his doctor the 'legitimate' way).



What would you do?  I figure either way I have debt being held over me.  If it's just between me and the bank/insurance company/landlord, etc then at least it's all laid out in black in white.  If it's debt to a family member, then it might have favorable terms but they can always pull a 180 on me...

personalfinance,Paying off car loan vs. paying toward loan with higher interest.,"Hi all. I know PF's mantra is ""higher interest first"". My income is not changing or increasing in the next year. This year I had an extra stipend which I will not have next year, so it's actually decreasing.

My car payment is $240.00. 2% set to be paid off 10/16.

I have several (5+) student loan payments coming to about $550 monthly. The median interest rate is 6.5%.

Together, this loan payment, with my added $250 to throw at one of my student loans to pay it down faster, is more than 1/3 of my income.

Once I get my contract for the next year, I was thinking about using some of my savings money to pay off the remaining balance of my car loan.

I was thinking I'd pay the car loan so that I can contribute a greater amount of money toward my student loans afterward (the 240 I was paying). Right now, feels like no dent is being made to the student loans, and I want them gone. If I pay off the student loan I can afford to pay off, the total amount of money paid each month would only decrease $65.

I do make regular rent payments but I do not think those always count.

In any case, what are my best options if I want to build credit using that student loan? I am very frugal and should have about ~17K to my name when I graduate since I saved a lot during college.  So I can easily pay the $3500 loan off immediately and it is also not accruing any interest since it's a subsidized Stafford loan (4.66% interest rate).

Here are some of my thoughts:

1. Pay it off before I graduate (or before the six month grace period after graduation) and not accrue any interest
2. Pay some of the principal off now, before any interests accrues 
3. Allow interest to accrue once I graduate and make regular payments (how large of payments?)
4. Some combination of the above.

Since I can pay it off in full and it's a relatively small amount, I have a lot of flexibility. I think it's also worth mentioning that I am essentially 100% on my own (meaning I have no familial support etc.) so that saved ~17K is all that I have once I graduate until I relocate and start my job so I am somewhat hesitant on paying it all back.

Related, but a bit off-topic. I might start using that credit card that I have for groceries to start building some credit. I am obviously keeping a good budget since I saved so much so I don't think using it would hurt me.

When I am trying to work through filing online, the software is getting confused because the sum of my ""state"" wages is $130k and my federal is only $100k. Why is my NY state return putting $100K as income when I only received $70k while being a resident? 

Note: I split my living arrangements but I worked in NYC for the entire year. Any help would be appreciated!",finance,1425159881
personalfinance,Advice on investing money,"I just used my bonus and federal tax refund to pay off my credit cards, paid my NY taxes (I owed need to figure out what my company is doing wrong), and signed up for my GMAT course (so expensive!).

I have 1.5k left over and want to invest it to start saving up for my expenses while at b-school (rent, living expenses etc.). I'm planning to go in 1-2 years so don't want to be risky about it. Also planning to set aside 300-500 a month (thanks for the raise job!). So over time I can invest 3600 to 6000 per year.

Any advice on where to go to invest? Online, professional, do it myself? I'm not that great at doing taxes myself so I think I won't be that great at investment by myself. 

Thanks!",finance,1425160640
politics,Herman Cain Should Be Prosecuted Under the Mann Act,"http://sexualobjectification.blogspot.com/2015/02/herman-cain-should-be-prosecuted-under.html

The White-Slave Traffic Act (aka the Mann Act) has been putting men in prison for more than 100 years.  Since 1994, the law has read thus:

    TITLE 18. CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE PART I. CRIMES
    CHAPTER 117. TRANSPORTATION FOR ILLEGAL SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND
    RELATED CRIMES @ 2421.

    Transportation generally
    Whoever knowingly transports any individual in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, with intent that such individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

One fellow who should have been prosecuted under the White-Slave Traffic Act is former New York governor Eliot Spitzer.  Temeka Rachelle Lewis, who was sentenced to one year of probation for her role as a booking agent for the Emperor's Club prostitution ring, made the arrangements for Governor Spitzer (aka Client 9) to have a sexual encounter with Ashley Dupré (professionally known as ""Kristen"") on the day before Valentine's Day, 2008, for $4300.  From transcripts of wiretapped calls between Miss Lewis and Miss Dupré

    ...At approximately 4:03 p.m., LEWIS received a call from ""Kristen."" During the call, ""Kristen"" said that she had heard the message, and that was fine. LEWIS and ""Kristen"" then discussed the time that ""Kristen"" would take the train from New York to Washington, D.C. LEWIS told ""Kristen"" that there was a 5:39 p.m. train that arrived at 9:00 p.m., and that ""Kristen"" would be taking the train out of Penn Station.

    LEWIS confirmed that Client-9 would be paying for everything - train tickets, cab fare from the hotel and back, mini bar or room service, travel time, and hotel...

Very clearly Mr. Spitzer knew that he was transporting ""Kristen"" in interstate commerce to engage in prostitution.  It should have been an easy conviction. However, Michael J. Garcia, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced on 8 November, 2008, that he would not seek criminal charges Mr. Spitzer:

    ...ELIOT SPITZER has acknowledged to this Office that he was a client of, and made payments to, the Emperors Club VIP.  Our investigation has shown that on multiple occasions, Mr. SPITZER arranged for women to travel from one state to another state to engage in prostitution. After a thorough investigation, this Office has uncovered no evidence of misuse of public or campaign funds. In addition, we have determined that there is insufficient evidence to bring charges against Mr. SPITZER for any offense relating to the withdrawal of funds for, and his payments to, the Emperors Club VIP.

    In light of the policy of the Department of Justice with respect to prostitution offenses and the longstanding practice of this Office, as well as Mr. SPITZER's acceptance of
    responsibility for his conduct, we have concluded that the public interest would not be further advanced by filing criminal charges in this matter.

""Insufficient evidence?""  ""Longstanding practice of this Office?""  What a putz. Other Americans are routinely sentenced to death with a heck of a lot less evidence than that.  Mr. Garcia couldn't even be bothered to put Mr. Spitzer away for five years?  Possibly Mr. Spitzer's high-powered legal team succeeded in softening Mr. Garcia's heart.  Maybe Mr. Garcia thought that Mr. Spitzer was just too pretty, too popular, or too well connected to send to prison.  Or, as Mr. Spitzer had expertise in money-laundering, and quite a LOT of money at his disposal, a substantial bribe might have done the trick.  Or, perhaps Mr. Spitzer's high-powered legal team had some information that Mr. Garcia was also cavorting with prostitutes, and transporting them across state lines, and it would have been highly inconvenient for Mr. Garcia if such information had come to light.  We'll never know for sure.  All we'll ever know is that prisons were never built for the wealthy and influential.  To think that this fellow was not only proud to have made what he did a felony in New York,

    I’m proud that we did sign that human-trafficking law, that was the right thing to do, it is important. It is something I believed in then, and believe in now. 

but was both proud and delighted to have gotten away with it.

    The decision was made based upon the standards set by the Department of Justice and made by the U.S. attorney’s office.  They looked at the office and dealt with me the way they dealt with everyone else in my situation.

Oh really?  Here is what Kristin Davis, who had procured prostitutes for Mr. Spitzer on various occasions, had to say:

    I spent four months in Rikers Island from which I returned penniless, homeless, and forced to take sex offender classes for five months with pedophiles and perverts, while he returned to his wife in his 5th Ave. high rise without ever being fingerprinted, mug shot, remanded, or charged with a crime under the very law he signed.

A few years in a federal penitentiary, followed by a year of sex-offender classes with pedophiles and perverts, would have done Mr. Spitzer a world of good, and saved other women and girls from becoming his victims.  Assuming a statute of limitations of five years for Mann Act violations, Mr. Spitzer would now be safe from prosecution, assuming that he has behaved himself since then (which seems highly unlikely, given his apparent addiction).  Herman Cain, the colorful presidential candidate, still isn't out of the woods.

Mr. Cain's candidacy was quite a hoot: the ""9-9-9"" Tax Plan (which came directly from the Sim City computer game, and which enchanted Republicans because of the prospects of raising taxes sharply for the poor while drastically cutting taxes for the rich);  his proposal to electrocute Mexicans;  his claim to be the half-brother of Charles and David Koch; and, his charming recital of poetry from a children's Pokémon movie.

For a brief time, the Republicans allowed Mr. Cain to be the front-runner for the Republican nomination, so that they could advance the claim that Republicans weren't racists.

Mr. Cain's campaign started falling apart when various White women stated that he had molested them sexually.  His campaign ended when Ginger White came forward, on Fox News, with the admission that she had served as Mr. Cain's concubine for the previous 13 years.

With that, Mr. Cain's candidacy was finished, and the Republican Party was done with him.  Mr. Cain couldn't even get any air time on Fox News.  He had to go to Wolf Blitzer on CNN to give his side of the story.

From the Fox News show:

    ...Miss White says she met Herman Cain in the late 90s in Louisville, Kentucky, when as president of the National Restaurant Association, he made a presentation. She was impressed. She says they shared drinks afterwards and he invited her back to his hotel room.

    “’I’d like to see you again,’” White said Cain told her. “’You are beautiful to me, and I would love for us to continue this friendship.’”

    She says in his hotel room, he pulled out a calendar and invited her to meet him in Palm Springs. She accepted, and she says the affair began....

    ...Ms. White says during the next 13 years, he would fly her to cities where he was speaking and he lavished her with gifts....

According to Georgia State Law:

    2010 Georgia Code
    TITLE 16 - CRIMES AND OFFENSES
    CHAPTER 6 - SEXUAL OFFENSES
    § 16-6-19 - Adultery

    A married person commits the offense of adultery when he voluntarily has sexual intercourse with a person other than his spouse and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as for a misdemeanor. 

Mr. Cain perpetrated the criminal offense of adultery--a misdemeanor in his home state of Georgia.  But, by bringing Miss White to other states for some adultery, Mr. Cain committed a felony offense under the White-Slave Traffic Act: ""Whoever knowingly transports any individual in interstate commerce,...with intent that such individual engage in...any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years.""  It doesn't matter whether the criminal offense was a misdemeanor in one's home state: once you bring a person to another state for some illegal sexual activity, it becomes a federal felony.

Moreover, Mr. Cain brought Miss White to Florida, where The Law states:

    798.01 Living in open adultery.—Whoever lives in an open state of adultery shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. Where either of the parties living in an open state of adultery is married, both parties so living shall be deemed to be guilty of the offense provided for in this section.

    798.02 Lewd and lascivious behavior.—If any man and woman, not being married to each other, lewdly and lasciviously associate and cohabit together, or if any man or woman, married or unmarried, engages in open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, they shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

The laws seem odd, given Florida's status as a major tourist destination, and the penchant of certain tourists to indulge in lewd and lascivious behavior whilst on vacation in the state.  Still, laws must be obeyed, and transgressors punished.  Otherwise, what would be the point of having any laws at all?  Writing a bunch of laws, and only enforcing the ones that certain government officials want to enforce, is an uncivilized, uncouth, and half-assed way of proceeding.  Either enforce all laws equally, or don't have any laws at all.

Mr. Cain formally announced his candidacy on November 14, 2011.  According to Miss White, Mr. Cain dismissed her as his concubine two months prior to the announcement--which would give the federal government until September, 2016 (at the latest) to launch its prosecution. If President Obama's Department of ""Justice"" were neither completely corrupt nor utterly incompetent, then Mr. Cain would have been toast by now.  How else are we to protect the women and girls of America from this sexual predator and brazen philanderer?  Not to mention our a massive prison-industrial complex that continually requires more inmates. 

We need to consign Mr. Cain to federal prison before that statute of limitations passes, and it is too late.  He'll make for quite a trophy, and his imprisonment will serve as a shining example to other would-be philanderers and adulterers.  Plus, Mr. Cain ought to find several years in a federal penitentiary to be a humbling experience, and no-one is in greater need of humbling right now than Herman Cain himself.",finance,1425164897

technology,Nancy Pelosi Releases Statement on FCC Voting 3-2 for Net Neutrality and Broadband Competition,"February 26, 2015 - Washington, D.C. 

Early Net Neutrality Supporter and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released this statement following the Federal Communications Commission vote today adopting clear rules protecting network neutrality on the Internet and promoting broadband competition: 

“Open Internet access is the foundation of freedom and innovation in the 21st century. The FCC’s historic decision recognizes that net neutrality is essential to our economy and our democracy. Communities across the country will see the benefits of new broadband competition fostered by the FCC’s vote for years to come. 

“The power of the Internet has always rested in its role as a level playing field where success is founded on the best ideas, not the deepest pockets. We finally have strong rules that protect consumers and innovators and will safeguard fair, fast, equal and competitive access to the Internet. These net neutrality standards will ensure that everyone has access to all the Internet can offer without gatekeepers influencing content, picking winners, or blocking the way. 

“Millions of Americans have made their voices heard in support of net neutrality standards that preserve the freedom and opportunity of the Internet. Today’s vote is a testimony to their dedication and energy, and a victory for our entire country.”",technology,1425167485
