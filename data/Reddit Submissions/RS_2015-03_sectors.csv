personalfinance,Store car for 13 months while abroad or sell and then repurchase different car upon coming back?,"Apologies for the wall of text:

Moving to Stockholm from San Francisco in 30 days and not sure what to do about my car. The job was offered as a 13-month contract, but I've the option to extend that ""as long as I want"" pending good work, so I may be in Sweden even longer than that.




I currently drive an older (2007) convertible that I *love*. I also owe ~$10,000 on it, so I do not hold the title and thus cannot sell to a private party.

I was 100% going to try to sell it to a dealer until this weekend. I keep getting low-balled by dealers because I'm not trading it in. The car is in pristine condition, KBB shows around $12,900 for excellent condition and even in ""good"" condition it's *still* over $11,700. My best offers are around $8,600. I'm not taking a loss on the car.

I *do* have the funds to buy the car outright, but if I do that and can't sell to a private party in the next few weeks then I'm even more screwed. For what it's worth, my interest rate is quite low and I've been using my excess funds to pay down student loans.

I found a place that will store the car for $140/mo. They'll drive it every few weeks, make sure it stays clean, and it's indoors, climate-controlled, and alarmed. With my current monthly payment, I'd be paying roughly $450/mo. 

**My Question:**

Is it worth it to store an 8 year old car for ~$6,000 for 13 months or take the loss, sell it to a dealer, and then get a different car when I come back? I imagine getting a new car or a used car would cost me far more than $6,000, but I'm wondering if this makes financial sense rather than just having the money *now*.

-----------------------------------
tl;dr - Drive luxury car. Owe ~$10,000 on it. Found a place to store it for 13 months for ~$6,000. Does it make financial sense to store while I'm gone or sell for a loss and get a different car when I return?",finance,1425170018

personalfinance,Want to invest ~3.5K. Don't understand the terminology on the bank websites and don't know which option is the best for me.,"Hi PF, 

I apologize if this sort of thread comes up daily, or even if it's in the FAQ but I can't seem to find an answer for myself. I guess I'd like some more opinions. 

I'm expecting around 3.5K back from taxes. I consider that as 'extra' money for now and would like to see it 'grow'. I've been told to look into accounts with compound interest or accounts that pay off dividends, not interest. However, when I start looking at my bank's website, there's 50 options that all look the same to me (GIC, Mutual Funds, Self-directed, etc) and none seem to be the one's I've been told to look for.

Some background:
I have ~30K in student debt that I don't have to start paying back until early 2016. I believe my interest rate is 3.5% and I've been told that if the interest on my loan is higher than the interested on my investment account then I should focus on paying off my loan first. I plan on starting a full-time job in September that would pay ~45K/year but I would also have to pay for rent/food/etc that would cost me ~18K/year. 

My goal is to apply for grad school as soon as I pay off my loans and save up enough to pay for it and my associated living costs. I'm estimating this would take about 2 years. In my ideal situation this 3.5K would help me start that ""saving for grad school"" fund. 

Am I being too optimistic about this 3.5K? Should I just use it to pay off my initial student loans? I apologize for sounding so stupid, I have 0 background in finances.",finance,1425186884
personalfinance,Home Buying: I think it's a mistake for me; am I wrong?,"So here's the setup: I have lived in my current city for almost three years now, and plan to stay for the foreseeable future. I have some interest in buying a home here at some point-- ""at some point"" being at least four years from now, when (assuming nothing goes wrong) I'll have paid off all of the ~$74k in debt I owe between student loans and my vehicle.

This plan has now been altered by a relative's interest in purchasing a home in my city. Said relative lives in another state, so the plan is that I would move into the house as a landlord and take on a renter to help cover all the costs of owning the home. 

Initially, the idea was that we would co-sign on a mortgage, I'd pitch in for initial updates/repairs, and we'd continued to renovate the property as needed over time. Now, though, my relative has suggested that the most advantageous plan would be for me to apply for the mortgage on my own, as I would stand to get a far better rate and subsidies due to being a first time home buyer; my relative, by contrast, already owns property and makes a significant amount of money, which means having their name on the mortgage would probably make it more expensive for us both.

It's a great plan in theory, but there's one problem: I can't afford to own a home.

Right now I earn ~$3655/month (after taxes) in a long term contract position, of which $933 goes straight to debt. A further ~$995 goes to bills (doesn't include utilities; those are rolled up in my rent, which is $600/month), which leaves me with ~$1700 for everything else. The average mortgage rate around here starts at $800, so already that's a huge bite out of my remaining funds. And the mortgage doesn't include costs like utilities, HOA, home repair, taxes, etc. So I'm guessing I'd be looking at a monthly cost to own closer to ~$1500 or $~1600, which means in a worst case scenario where I lose a renter and my relative's contribution to the cost of the home, I'd be facing financial ruin pretty much instantly. And that doesn't even take into account the possibility of losing my current contract job; it's a remote chance, thankfully, as the company has expressed their desire to convert me to full time in the next year or so, but it's a risk nonetheless.

Second, while I do have savings, they were not built with a home purchase in mind. I have enough to cover about four months of expenses, and sure I could wipe that out to cover some costs of the house, but then I'd be in an even more precarious financial situation with nothing to save me if something goes wrong. 

This whole scenario is making me more and more anxious by the day. The idea is that we'd have the home purchased by summer, as that's when my lease at my current apartment runs out, but it all feels like too much, too soon. I know why my relative wants to take the plunge-- home prices in my area are shooting up by the month, the feds are about to raise interest rates on loans, if we don't buy now we'll be priced out of the area entirely within a year-- but I feel like I can't commit to getting a mortgage right now. I'm managing my finances pretty well as things stand, but I just feel in my heart that signing my name on that dotted line will be signing myself up for disaster.

So: my question to you is, what's the best way to approach this scenario? Is getting this house pretty much impossible under the circumstances, or is there some middle ground option we should be considering?

(I should add that I know basically nothing about homebuying, as when we first discussed this plan we did so with the idea that my relative would be handling the financial/paperwork portion and I'd just be contributing money where needed. I should *also* add that this is a relative I trust implicitly, and who has always conducted their business transactions honestly and faithfully, so I'm not concerned about them trying to screw me over.)",finance,1425195770
personalfinance,"Trying to maximize my liquidity/CC benefits over the next few months before graduating, planning a trip, and moving. Help appreciated.","Background:

Hi all, I'm a 24 year old grad student about to graduate and move cross country to start work in Sept (offer letter signed). I'm the first in my family to really ever make significantly more than low income, and i want to enter this next phase in my life clear headed so that I can give back to my family and those who supported me on the way here. My immediate concern is managing my liquidity over the next few months before I start work while planning a trip and a move.

Current Debt Situation:

200k in grad/undergrad loans (90% graduate); 7200 CC limit over four cards - all statements cleared in full; no other loans, own my car outright.

My FICO score is currently between 690-750, and I suspect the lower one is because the statement date came before I cleared my others giving me pretty high utilization last month.

Being extremely liberal, I estimate that I will need to spend roughly $8500-9000 in rent/utilities/food/entertainment/GF/gas/professional mandatory testing ($3,000 or so my job has provided cash for)

Finances:

I currently have saved roughly $10.5k, with another $1,500 to come back for security deposit when my lease ends in August (I budget assuming I'll only get $1000 back). 

My starting salary is roughly $175k pre tax, and I'd like to get at my loans pretty aggressively. My job will be paying moving expenses for me across the country.

The Question(s):

I have roughly a month and a half for travel in August, and I'll be using part of this month and a half to travel. My profession is one where people work inexplicably long hours and I doubt I'll get a chance to visit some of these places with some of these people for years (if ever). I'm trying to figure out the best way to finance this trip and find a new apartment while maintaining some liquidity going into September. Unfortunately because we haven't yet decided where we're going it's hard to plan, but I've decided to assume the worst and expect to spend maybe $4000 (this is double what I expect).

With my current budget estimates I'll have about $2.5k in cash and all my credit available to help with finding a new place to live in September ($9.7k), but I'm moving to a stupefyingly expensive city and I'm worried about not having liquidity.

My plan:

my CCs are all mostly old and given to me when I was in UG or had mediocre credit, I don't get too many benefits. My thoughts were to look into something like the Chase sapphire preferred (for travel) and pair it with a good balance transfer card. I thought I could pay for my necessary professional expenses and living expenses on the Chase to get the free miles and the other card to transfer my older cards balance too after using them for July and August.

I guess I'm wondering if this is wise? I realize I could do this with my current cards by carrying a balance on them, but their interest rate is high and I don't get any benefits to help mitigate costs. Also, I figured now might be a good time to get ""grown up"" cards and card limits, but I am wary of starting off on the wrong foot.",finance,1425225354
personalfinance,Advice on sale of mom's house for home remodel and her retirement income,"Hi,

I'm looking for ideas on how to make my family's changing situation best for all. 


My mother expects to make 200-300k from the sale of her primary residence. She is 62 and hasn't saved any significant amount for her retirement. 


We have talked about her moving into our house to help with childcare (I have a year old baby) and increased equity from a remodel were planning in exchange for free room and board. Additionally, my mom has expressed giving us some of her home sale profits to help finance the remodel.


We live in San Jose, ca. 


The problem is our house needs additional space to accommodate her, to the tune of 200-300k. Since we bought the house a few years ago we've accrued about 200k in equity.


I am looking for ideas on how to make the most mutually beneficial situation for both of us.


Here are my questions:

1) what are her best options to avoid capital gains on the profits from her home sale?  Can she transfer any significant amount to us, say 100k, tax free for us to finance the remodel without having her name added to our house title?


2) We've started working with designers on our house and the consensus is the project would require us to live offsite for up to 6 months. A comparable living situation to ours would be at least 3.5k per month in rent. My mother is very set that she needs to sell asap due to it being a sellers market and if she waits until next year she'll lose money due to the fed ending quantitative easing and presumably interest rates rising.  I think at least 21k in rental on top of paying for a remodel is just too daunting, and think it would be better to live at my mom's while construction is ongoing to avoid extra costs.  How to determine who is right?


3) from my research, a HEL seems like a better option than a HELOC to finance the remodel given we plan to stay in the house for at least the next 15 years. Are there other options to consider?

personalfinance,"Am I crazy, or can I actually save money by using the extended payment plan for federal loans? Hear me out.","I have been paying back my student loans on the 10 year plan for just over a year and a half right now. I can afford this amount, so I was going to continue paying it (and more as I can afford it in future), but I was considering changing the underlying plan to the extended (25 year) plan. My required minimum payment would drop to 333 from 636, but I would continue paying the 636.

So, why? Well,

1. it seems like this would allow some breathing room just in case I ever have an emergency. Same reason behind buying a house with a 30 year loan and paying it like 15.
2. I believe the math works out with how they apply the extra payments to the higher interest loans that it would save me money, actually:

Here are the details:

Subsidized Principal Balance:

* $7,260.45 @ 3.150%
* $4,813.08 @ 4.250%
* $3,390.24 @ 5.350%

Unsubsidized Principal Balance:
$34,293.72 @ 6.550%

Standard plan: 636.33/mo

Extended plan: 332.44/mo (estimated - they only told me 333 and 637 for my 636.33)

I already checked that my loan servicer applies extra payments to the highest rate loan: ""** If there are multiple loans in an account, the extra amount, in this example $75, will be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate."" ([source](https://www.mygreatlakes.org/educate/knowledge-center/how-payments-are-applied.html)).

Using Payoff.io (thanks to another /r/pf-er for creating!), I find that according to my current repayment plan, I pay a total of [12,983.21](http://payoff.io/#/s/c27db45818cac431) in interest with finishing May of 2023. With the extended, it comes out to [11,879.82](http://payoff.io/#/s/67582a0e380da59c) and March of 2023.

CreditCard: $X The credit card is a quick silver capital one I recently opened to begin building credit, and only use it to put gas in my car. I'll estimate it to be around $75-$110, however I'm sure I'm being generous.

Insurance: $80 (I currently pay about $29 for my Miata, and $51 for my Firebird)

I plan on selling my firebird in the coming weeks for around $2800. I don't use it, and have been considering selling it, and using the money towards paying off my loan. That would drop my insurance down to about 30 a month, which I figure I could pay a years premium in full, and get a slight discount. I've also considered paying for a years phone service, as I use straight talk, instead of around 52 a month, I could pay $495 plus tax and have service for a year and save a little bit of money there as well.

Edit: After tax, this plan will cost me 547.25, compared to the 52*12 at around $624

Assuming I do that, I could get away with only paying off my credit card each month in full. Would this be a good decision financially? Or should I NOT do some of these things, and why? As far as I'm aware, the loan does not have an early termination fee, and paying it off early won't have any ""negative"" marks on my credit score, I'll just have one on time payment each month dedicated to building my credit (the credit card) instead of two (the loan and credit card.)


Just looking for some advice, thanks PF!

Edit2: I haven;t had credit very long, and the loan was being used as a way to establish SOME sort of credit, until I got approved by this card. I know I shouldn't take out loans TO build credit, but it was a few months back, and several places denied me a card due to lack of credit history, so I cosigned with my stepmother who has good credit, and got the unsecured personal loan at an interest rate of @6.74%",finance,1425252461

financialindependence,HELOC for leveraged investing?,"After maximizing 401k and IRA contributions, I am looking to add to my taxable account investments.   If I can stomach the risk (I can handle it financially) I believe this will accelerate my path towards FI.   I would love to get some advice.  

I have a healthy nest egg, but all in tax advantaged retirement accounts.   My  current housing costs are below 20% gross and I have no other debts.  My saving rate is high but I  have only a few thousand dollars in a taxable brokerage account.  I have trouble adding more than a few thousand a year after maximizing tax-adv accounts.   

 I want to jumpstart this by taking 80K from a 100K variable HELOC at 3.86% and investing in VTSAX and a little bit of VTIAX.   The rate varies with prime (3.25%) so I certainly could be caught with my pants down when the Fed raises rates.   The max it can go up is 2% per year.    The entire interest only payment I believe would be a tax write off reducing the effective APR to ~%2.89.

The cost of carrying the interest only payments on the HELOC  are pretty low.  As interest rates change I should be able to move the investments around and continue to beat the rate on my secured debt.   I am fully aware this is leveraged investing and I could easily lose 10 grand.   I am financially secure and could handle the payments anyway even if my investment went to 0. This obviously won't happen and I have no problems managing debt. I have no dependents or family to worry about and can handle a higher risk than most.    

I am pretty young and itching to get ahead.   A HELOC seems to be the only access to cheap money I have and I am ready to put it to work.   I was originally planning to use it towards an investment property but as local real estate skyrocket it seem more out of reach.   I can't seem to get the returns the market has been giving on these real estate projects and they require massive amounts of time and effort.

personalfinance,Graduating dental school with ~152k in debt and going into the military as a captain.,"I'm currently going to be graduating dental school in May and its time to start paying off my school loans.

I will be employed as a captain with the US military for a guaranteed 4 years so my income will stay in the same range. I have no credit card debt, car payment, or kids. So most of the money I will be making will go directly to paying off loans. With my current lifestyle I live off of ~$24,000 a year.

&amp;nbsp;


Here is most of my loans and they are at a fixed rate of 6.00%
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/fBxXQLA.png)
I also have ~10k in student loans that I'm repaying the minimum because I can't deffer them any longer (7 year grace period). They are 3.20% variable. 

&amp;nbsp;


Here is what the breakdown of my salary should look like when I start in July. Correct me if I'm wrong about the taxable and nontaxable items.  

Basic Housing allowance ~$16,000(nontaxable) 

 O-3 Salary $46,500 (taxable)  Bonus $20,000 (taxable)  

Basic Subsistence Allowance $3,000 (nontaxable) 

 Grand Total Salary $85,500 (before taxes)

&amp;nbsp;


My thought process would be to pay off the outstanding interest before I graduate with some type of loan. I don't want that being tacked on top of the initial loan amount. USAA offers a student cadet loan of $25,000 @ 3.00% fixed with a 5 year repayment period (~470 a month). Then I would start to pay off the larger loan of $43,000 and $32,000. I'm also looking into if any loan provider will freeze my student loan (no accruing interest) while I'm on active duty. Has anyone heard of a loan provider doing that?  

&amp;nbsp;


Are there any other loan options out there that have a longer repayment period with that low of interest rate?
My parents could always offer me a loan, but I would rather keep my family out of my finances.

personalfinance,What would you do? (pay off debt vs invest),"Sorry bout the long post... and I really hope my math is correct. But first, the numbers:

* 30 years old, married ~$146k total income
* $121k in debt ($68k mortgage @ 5.375% $90k valuation, $41k student loans @ 3.3%, $12k auto loan at 2.9%)
* $54k saved for retirement
* $15k emergency fund
* ~$3,775 monthly surplus in budget after maxing both IRAs and paying minimums on debt.


After a few career moves, and hefty salary increases along the way, my wife and I finally have a pretty large surplus in our budget and we're trying to figure out what we should do with it. Neither of our employers offer 401k's so that's not an option. We would like to move to a new house in 5 years. We also don't see our expenses changing much, or salaries increasing more than keeping up with inflation for a few years at least.


Basically we're just asking the question, what would you do? Pay down the debt, invest in a taxable account, or something else.


Here's the two ideas we're thinking about with some more numbers:


**Option 1** Pay off all our debt. We could theoretically pay EVERYTHING off, in about 3 years, while still contributing $11k per year to our IRAs. This is the least risky, while still guaranteeing a ""return"" at the rate of our debt's interest rate. Plus we think it would be awesome to OWN our home at 33 years old.


This would leave us with $87k in our retirement fund at 33 years old and 0 debt. If we want to get to the recommended 1x salary saved at 35 years old, we would need to save another 30k per year to accomplish this. Adding our current debt payments (which we would no longer be paying) to our current monthly savings would yeild $5375 in monthly surplus or $64k per year. Save $19k/year of that for retirement (plus our continuing $11k IRA contributions), and $45k/year for a house down payment, and after 2 more years (5 years from now) we would have our target $146k in retirement (not including gains), and $180k ($90k equity + $90k cash) for our next house's down payment. From here it would be smooth sailing only having mortgage debt (yay for good debt), and still having plenty of money left over to save for the earliest retirement possible, or increase our spending if we wanted. Net worth at the end of 5 years would be roughly $146k retirement + $180k house savings + equity = $326k


The downside of this, is we delay investing and dont reap the benefits of compounding interest, which brings us to our next option:


**Option 2** Don't pay off any debt more than minimum payments. Without looking at an amortization chart for the mortgage, after 5 years we would have ~$30k in equity in the home. We would need an extra $150k over 5 years to have the same $180k downpayment for our next house, which comes out to $2500 a month, leaving $1275 to put into a taxable account every month. After 2 years, the car will be paid off, and we'd add another $460 to the monthly savings. After 5 years that would be equal to $93k in retirement savings. Add our current $58k + $66k ($11k per year IRA) to that for a grand total of $206k in retirement savings. Again without looking at amortization charts, our debt might be somewhere around $18k in student loans. Net worth here would be $180k + $206k - $18k = $368k


Of course these net worths arent taking into account any returns on investments, so the second option would likely give me a much higher net worth than is illustrated here because more money will be invested for a longer period of time. However, because they aren't guaranteed ""returns"" like paying off debt is, if the market performs poorly the difference might be negligible, or even give me better ""returns"" with the first option. Another point is that with option 1 we would have $146k in our retirement, and with option 2 we would have $206k.


We know this question is asked a lot on here, and mathematically and historically, we'd probably do better investing vs paying off debt, but we can't help but think about how nice it would be to own our home, and the security that goes along with that if the economy goes south. We're both kind of leaning toward option 1. So have at it reddit, what would you do?

We would love to purchase a house sooner rather than later, but the student loans are killing our debt to income ratio. I changed fields, so my income can't be included for a pre-approval. We both hold credit scores of 790+ with 5+ years of history. Student loans are at an interest rate of 3% and 6%. Does our plan for paying off loans while building our retirement accounts make sense?

gaming,This is an incredibly important message to me. Please read it. I feel like it will help improve the environment for a lot of people.,"I originally wrote this somewhere else in search of fellow female gamers. 

Typically I do not enjoy female themed events, groups etc. because I feel as though it can drive the segregation further. Over this past weekend during my time at GottaCon [local gaming convention], I have once gain been reassured of the (for lack of a better term) dick waving that comes with video gaming. I have enjoyed, NO, engulfed myself with video games, trading card games, role playing events and I even took shop classes as much as possible for my entire life. I am no stranger to male dominated fields. What is the most male dominated field I am most sick of? Video gaming. 

(Just to be clear I --really-- am not one to point out *omgimagamergirl*, I feel like that gives very a bad impression to my cause).

D&amp;D players, or other role players, are always so excited to have other adventurers join the fray! I find them to be the most easy going. Which may seem surprising due to social stigmas. 

Magic the gathering players are also very accepting but sometimes I do find myself being talked over and 'reminded of the rules'. Not that I'm a pro player but it happens to me more often than a male counterpart. 

But video games, console or PC, in my opinion have the worst community when it comes to women. Now I'm not talking about HOW they're portrayed in game. Both male and female characters are hyper sexualized and completely over the top. When you can play virtual god why not make them perfect? So to me! It's all about the community. 

It's starts off with my first interactions with the online community. The Xbox 360. Right from there you know it's going to be bad! They were convinced I was a small boy. They treated me like a child and said things about how I'm up past my bedtime and that I should watch my language. Those who actually believed I was a girl WERE COMPLETELY DUMBFOUNDED EVERY TIME. At first it was funny but this reeeally did get tiring. After the initial shock it was then almost always followed by sexual harassment. Exactly what a teenage girl should hear right? A fair bit of time goes by and I gave up on talking to strangers and just played in silence by myself. This was years ago but I still continued to steadily play. And as you can imagine it did detract from the experience. Now I did have a small group of personal friends to play with sometimes. However over time, that has now diminished to practically nonexistent. 

I have just recently ascended to PC (due to financial issues or it would have been A LOT sooner). I was feeling more optimistic. I figured the players in this category are more mature. While they may be older I'm not sure how different they really are. 

I've been playing games and of course still too nervous to join the chat, have just been lurking. Monitoring the chat boxes listening to the voices. And while the voices sound older it really is all the same lingo that has been said and typed (As much as PCMR does not want to admit it). 

With that being said I was still feeling a bit more courageous and have recently been feeling like I should just put myself out there and see what kind of guild or group I could join. Until my final day of GottaCon. 

In November I picked out all my PC parts and I did a TON of research. I don't actually think I've ever learned so much on my own merits and determination. I crammed SO much information in my nogan in just a few months. I diligently saved up and did so much research information about companies to buy from. This wasn't no blind just fly at her job. I'm really in for the long haul and genuinely interested in this industry. 

But anyway. I wasn't even interested in going to the final day of GottaCon 'til I decided to read the event program early Sunday morning once more. Advanced PC modding workshop? I have a dremal and creativity! I'm so in! 

The panel decently informative but still some pretty basic information over all. Whatever. Still really great they put this event on and took the time to answer any questions from the audience. They had really notable and informative reps from NCIX and Thermaltake. Awesome!

At the end they handed out a whole bunch of prizes, yay! T-shirts and mouse pads to fans and even a mobo. My number was called for a prize and I'm incredibly excited! We always enter but how often do we really win? Now is the time to note the announcer from Tectoria had HARDLY critiqued any winner (they handed out 10+ prizes already). They had an awesome amount of prizes and were quickly trying to get through them. But when I got called he had something to say. ""Come get your prize from Uncle Bob"" (Bob being a rep from NCIX). The announcer then said ""Oh, did that seem inappropriate?"". Thankfully, I heard Bob mumble something like ""Yes, it did"". I grunted the same thing myself. 

Was this really fucking called for? I felt so embarrassed in front a crowd of people I have been trying to fit into my whole life! Y'know, the super geeky gamer nerds who don't even fit into anything?! And I'm trying to accepted into them! In hindsight I really wish I threw the tshirt back at the 30 year old commentator, who is representing a large company in front of a huge room of people!

At this point I am so incredibly frustrated.

My experience so far with meeting gamers (of any platform) IRL is that 1: they really don't give a fuck what I have to say because I'm obviously overcome with hysteria  2: Try to get my number. 
I can't help but feel like a lot of other female gamers are faced with the same obstacles. We see these stats that give high percentages of women in the community but where are they? I think they're just like me. Too beaten down and tired from the community to interact and participate.  

So I guess I come to my conclusion. What is the point of this? I'm looking for other women in my same position. Those who want to learn about PC hardware, gaming tactics or general banter in an environment that will take your opinion into consideration without an ulterior sexual motive. I just want to have fun and play games like every other guy. Why does this have to be so fucking hard?

personalfinance,Plan of action for $15k in debt,"I have 11k in credit card debt, 4k in a loan, and around 2k in medical bills after an accident in February. Here's my current standings: 

    CC#1	$4,159.42	17.99% (A small part of this is sort of a business expense I'm waiting for money to come in on)
    CC#2	$0.00 (Never even actually used this card, not sure on rate)
    CC#3	$4,377.02	15.24%
    CC#4	$1,910.91	22.99%
    CC#5	$0.00	22.24%
    CC#6	$0.00	25.99%
    Loan	$3,916.92	14.256% 
    Med	$2k? (waiting for insurance to process still)

Last year I went off sorta half-cocked on trying to get things in order and got the personal loan to consolidate some of the CC debt. It was for 7k over 2 years. My credit score at the time was 625 - as provided by the bank when I got the loan. (Between high balances, still recovering from some bad choices, and getting screwed by my parents when I was younger, is why my credit isn't so hot. I think you can see my credit improvement in my interest rates though) I think it's clear which cards I haven't been using and why. 

About the medical expenses - I broke my collarbone and had a plate put in. I did something similar about 5 years ago so I'm estimating costs. I do know the ER visit is $526 after insurance, and I've hit my deductible just from that.

My main checking account is through a big name bank, and I have a checking and savings account with a local credit union that I don't really use (other than a monthly direct deposit for savings). 

I was thinking of seeing if I could renegotiate that loan, or get a new one (and pay it off along with everything else) to A) lower the interest rate and B) move the rest of my credit card debt and medical bills on to it. 

I have a few questions - 

* Does a longer term on the loan help get me a lower interest rate? I've budgeted my expenses out and I can swing a 3 year loan at 10-13% pretty easily. I'm willing to go 5 years to get the lower rate and just pay more on the principal so it's done at 2-3 years if something like that would help get a lower rate. 
* Should I go back to the big bank, or head to the credit union?
* Should I use my admittedly meager savings to get a secured loan instead?

With my CC debt eliminated, I'd like to live CC free for a few more months enforce to breaking the habit (it's been 3 months since I last used any of them) Then start using CC#3 again for it's rewards - like buying groceries, cell bill, etc and immediately paying it back. (Besides its low interest rate, it has the best rewards of the bunch for my wants/goals)

Anything else I should consider or be aware of?

-I have been working for 18 months (50k/yr) im 26
-I have been contributing 12% to my employee sponsored Traditional 401k since i started
-I just now realized the move should have been to contribute that money to a Roth IRA (I am definitely going to be in a lower tax bracket now than in the future)

Q1: My employee matches 5%, do they match 5% regardless of whether i choose a traditional 401k or ROTH IRA?
(Do i need to contribute 5% to the traditional and 7% to the Roth to take full advantage of the matching..or can i slide all 12% over to the Roth and get 5% matching in that)

Q2: I have already filed and received my tax returns, is there a way to move the already matched/contributed money in my Traditional IRA over to the Roth account.

I also have  a good college fund so paying tuition isn't a huge issue. I'm curious if it would be better to invest this money or take out loans because the interest rate is low and I might be able to gain more money from investments than I would from using it to pay tuition.

personalfinance,"I'm hacking my way out of an ugly tax situation, and I don't know what my best option is.","Extremely long story short from a throwaway:

In 2002, I got my first real job. Single, nothing like a real job before, did what I had always done before: claimed Exempt on my W4. Never was a problem before, figured if it was, the IRS would let me know, especially since the new job was connected to the federal government.

They did. Quite a few years later. For the years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, &amp; 2010. Que ""seven years of unpaid taxes"", ""having my W4 reset to *Filing Status Single, no Exemptions* and locked"", ""Paycheck levy"", and ""Abject humiliation"". Got letters saying that they processed how much I owed assuming that I filed without any extra details, and the total amount was pretty hefty, especially for a low-level job that didn't require a degree to get.

It's 2015. For the last five years, I've been taxed at Single no Exemptions, and levied on top of it for the missing years. Having learned from my mistake, I filed in 2012 for 2011, 2013 for 2012, 2014 for 2013, and watched what would be the refund from my W4 (and going to college) get intercepted for the missing years. When I file for 2014 this month, I expect the same thing's going to happen. Unfortunate, but it is what it is.

But in the last four-plus years, I've only been able to pay off two of my missing seven years. That would lead me to think that it's going to take another decade, at least, to pay off the rest. The interest and penalties are killer, and I'm still stuck in that low-level job. Even worse, I've been dropped to part-time, and at only 20 hours a week, this is going to bleed me dry.

I assume that all the ads you run into on television and the radio to get someone to bail you out of your debt are for suckers.

One year ago I took out a loan at the auto dealership for a new (used) minivan for my growing family.  My credit at the time was in the mid 600s, so I wound up with a 4.99% 72 month loan with Wells Fargo Dealer services.  Right now my loan balance is approx $16,000 with 60 months to go.  My vehicle only appraises on Kelley Blue Book for a little over $15,000, however I would be able to pay this difference in cash when/if I refinance if necessary.

What's changed ... in the past year I started a new job (literally a month after buying this car).  I now make $25,000 more per year, and subsequently have been proactively getting out of debt.  After paying off and consolidating my credit cards into a lower interest personal loan, and selling my old house for a small profit, my credit score is now in the low 800s.

All that being said, after seeing an ad on credit karma I realized I qualified for a lower auto loan rate (1.99 to 2.99 apr).  This would save me a bit of money over the remaining portion of my loan.

I tried Lightstream back in December.  I was approved the same day, but they wanted to roll up some kind of $500 insurance policy that was non negotiable since my car was so old.  Since I didn't pay this when I originally financed the car and it seemed shady I cancelled this...

My question is:  what company would you recommend for my scenario?  I am trying to pay a fair interest rate considering that my credit profile has changed significantly in the past year.

personalfinance,"Returning to school, what is my best course of action to pay off my credit card debt?","So, this summer I am returning to school to begin a second undergrad degree in Computer Engineering. I decided to do this, most importantly, to follow my passion. If I take classes year round, it should take me 2.5-3 years to get this degree. My other undergrad degree just wasn't giving me what I want out of my career (I worked in auditing and consulting). While this is very exciting, I have some debt to deal with while returning to school.

My biggest concern is my CC debt. As of right now, I have one card with a balance of $6,975.69 and god awful 15.99% APR. The other card has a balance of $5,690.18 at 15.24%. I know this is bad, and it is a long story of how I got here (hospital stay, surgery, move, and a botched marriage proposal).

Luckily, I am going to be living at home when I go back to get this degree. Also, my parents have agreed to pay for all but my last two semesters for this new degree. I also plan on working while going to school.

I guess I am having trouble deciding where to start and what to do next. I have a total of $12,665.87 in CC debt. I will be getting $3,218 back from taxes. I also gave a personal loan to a friend when I had a great job, and they will be repaying the total of $2,000 April 1st. Both of these sums I will use to pay down my debts. My parents have said that they would give me $2,000 at the end of 2015 to help pay off the debt, pending that I have a 3.3 GPA (I would rather not rely on their help, though).

I have considered cashing out a 401k that I have a little over $3k in to help pay it down, but idk if that would be worth it. That could mean losing out on a nice chunk of change by the time I'm 65. I've also considered P2P Lending such as Prosper, in the hopes of getting  lower interest rates and consolidating my debts.

Before my finances got weird, I had excellent credit. For one of my jobs I travelled a lot, and put all of my work expenses on a personal card that was paid in full every month after getting reimbursed by the company.

personalfinance,Pay down debt or invest?---A different take on this great debate. (CAN),"Hello Redditors,

My first post ever to Reddit! I've been a long time lurker and finally decided to make the plunge and join. I would like to share my view about a widely discussed topic that receives a lot of different opinions, that is paying down debt vs investing.

IMO, the fact that you are considering either of the two represents a great personal decision that deserves a pat on the back. You have decided to avoid the ultimate temptation to NOT SPEND IT. Bravo. 

So you have some extra income and some debt. You are also savvy enough to think about your future and investing the money also interests you. Should you go 100% debt, 100% investing or is there a nice ratio in between?

I like to approach problems like this from a logical stand point and most financial advisers will do the same. The general argument is to put the majority of your money toward the highest interest or rate of return depending on the debt or investment. For example if you have a loan with an interest rate of 6%, and your investment is only anticipated to return 3% then the logical answer is to focus the majority of your money on paying off the debt. A lot of people argue you should go 100% debt no matter what, I disagree.  

DO NOT discount the value of starting good habits early. Investing in it's most successful form relies on proper education, starting early, and staying the course. In many cases if you are young and have 30+ years of investing ahead of you, skipping on e year of investing now can cost you thousands of dollars at the end of your investing term, thanks to compound interest. Not only that but going through the process of learning how to set up automatic withdrawals for investing, getting exposure to market fluctuations, learning proper asset allocation, and disciplining yourself to re-balance your portfolio regularly enforces a priceless habit that will pay you generously in the years to come. That does not mean do not pay down debt, it just means you should consider the intangible value of starting good habits early and come up with a ratio accordingly. There are lots of other variables of course such as how much debt you owe, the kind of debt, your age, life situation, etc etc. On a general sense though consider always having a regular investment no matter what. When taxes get taken out of your pay check you don't miss them right? Pretend investing is like taxes and take it immediately.

Note: if it is credit card debt. Pay it off at a generous ratio. No long term proper investment will give you a rate of return to offset that and there is a bigger habit you should learn to kick first which is trying your best to limit credit card balances. The interest is just too high.

So what value (in terms of an interest rate) do you put on investing? 1%, 5%, 10%? It's all up to you but simply looking at where is the highest interest and piling all your money onto that IMO is not the way to go. Just like anything, a balance is best and paying a bit of a premium for it can be worth it.

personalfinance,LPT: If refinancing out of FHA close at the end of the month,"Hard lesson learned on my part last week when I just closed my refi. Essentially when you refinance out of an FHA loan you are responsible for the entire month of interest for the month that the loan is closed in. So close at the end of the month, but not too close to the end of the month. Rule of thumb is 5 business days before the end of month is a safe bet.

For example: Assume the interest portion of your monthly PITI is $800 on your current FHA loan and $700 on your new loan.

Close on Jan 30th

* You are responsible for FHA's January interest payment of $800. 
* You start paying interest on your new loan as of Jan 30. In January you will pay 1-2 days of interest on the new loan, ~$23. 
* Total interest paid in January is $825

Close on Jan 1st

* You are responsible for FHA's January interest payment of $800. 
* You start paying interest on your new loan as of Jan 1, $700.
* Total interest paid in January is $1500

You are essentially paying double interest for every day in the month post closing.  If your old loan was conventional loan you would only be responsible for interest up until the day of closing and nothing after the loan was closed. I'm not sure how the FHA can get away with this.

Also **VERY** important is that the official day of closing is not the day you sign papers, it is the day the FHA loan is funded. Federal law requires a 3 day rescinding period after closing which allows borrowers to back out of the deal. What this means is that if you sign on 2/25/15 (like in my case), the loan will not be funded until 3/2/15. This is a result of 3 business days of rescinding. Needless to say I'm a bit upset over this. Live and learn though.

personalfinance,"With low interest rates, better to buy for the long term or flip?","My wife and I don’t have much money, but we were recently married and have a small sum with which we are intending to purchase our first piece of real estate.  Since our start-up capital is relatively small, we have been looking at multi-units so we can save on our living expenses in the short-term and get into the investment property game while interest rates are low and we can qualify for a loan as an owner-occupier.  As a strict investment, the banks would require 25% down, whereas with an owner occupied loan, it can be as little as 3.5% down.  The question we have is whether it is a better financial decision to find a property we intend on keeping for the life of the loan or to find one we may be able to flip in 3-5 years.  We want to own a single family home eventually and so the multi-unit is really just a tool to get there.

personalfinance,Some Key Elements to Financial Decision Making,"This is extracted from my blog. I can't share it on here, so if there is interest, I will of course advise! But I thought this post would be useful to some.  
  
You may one day be in a situation where you have some spare money and need to make a decision on what to do with it. You’ll already know that one of the worst possible ideas you can have is to keep it in a bank; you’ll see from a previous post here, that keeping your money in the bank will probably make you poorer.
With this spare money, we, as savvy money people, in theory should be looking for opportunities to grow our money to make us richer [or other equivalent interpretation of “rich”]; this could either be to gather a return 40 years down the line, or to gather a return 2 years down the line. In any event, the ultimate objective is to grow money and make it work for us, resulting in the creation of value that will make you further richer, as result of having it. The opposite is poorer by not using it properly and being subject to forces like inflation and interest rates.  
  
I must start with a disclaimer that most investment opportunities come with risk. The underlying principle of risk is that the more risk you are asked to take, the more you should be rewarded for it; that’s why Government bonds are so low yielding – this is mainly because of their low risk nature, relative to a business deal or stock opportunity. Risk even comes with keeping money in your bank, but the low return on your money suggests that a bank is also low risk. This is a good article that describes the risk-reward relationship in more detail. It is to be noted that everything comes with risk and in this article, I assume you are assessing risk relative to your risk appetite as required. If you’re not comfortable with an opportunity and it doesn’t “feel right”, then it’s too risky for you – simple!  
  
So the three things to take in to consideration when considering an investment opportunity are (in this order):  
  
**1. Return on Capital Employed**  
*or “Return on Employed Capital”; “Return on Invested Capital”; “Return on Capital Invested”*  
The ROCE measure tells us what the percentage profit return is on the money we invest is i.e. the amount of profit a person makes as a percentage of their total money invested.
This is probably the most widely used measure used to determine an opportunity’s profitability. It takes in to consideration the income generated by the opportunity relative to the amount of money that is to be invested and presents this as a number in percentage terms.
  
What’s also important is that it is a percentage based measure; this allows us to compare the ROCE with other opportunities to see which is more profitable, irrespective of opportunity figures or size of investment. This is useful in the event you have two opportunities and don’t know which to invest in.
  
Ensure this figure beats your bank interest rate and inflation where possible. The higher this figure is, the better.  
  
**2. Time Value of Money**  
*or “TVOM”*  
Okay, so with your ROCE measures in your hand from two opportunities (#1 &amp; #2) for example, it’s now important to know how long it will take for your return from each opportunity to materialise. This is important because although ‘opportunity #1′ may offer an ROCE of 45% and ‘opportunity #2′, 30%, the time difference between these two opportunities may influence the investment decision.
Fathom this: ‘Opportunity #1′ will give you your initial investment + 45% return in 30 years and ‘opportunity #2′ a 30% ROCE in 10 years. Naturally, based on a quick back of envelope calculation, most people would go for ‘opportunity #2′ otherwise the investor may be waiting an extra 20 years for a further 15% return! Furthermore, if you break it down to a yearly basis, it would suggest ‘opportunity #2′ is more profitable across the project term, despite the lower ROCE! – this is why time period is important.
Anyway the real reason the measure of how long the opportunities will take to materialise a return is important is because (a) the longer it’s taking to get your money back, the more opportunities you may be missing to generate either an equal or higher return. Secondly, (b) as time progresses, the value of each pound tied up in both your initial investment and anticipated return is uncertain. The value of the pound may fluctuate and worst case, be worth less in the future than today – think of quantitative easing or inflation and these diminishing the value of the currency, therefore rendering that same pound less valuable in the future, not being able to buy the same amount of things as it can today. So the quicker the return, the better, because you can use money in your hands today, based on todays value to invest to either generate more money or buy more things instead of tomorrow’s uncertain value.  
  
**3. Opportunity Costs**  
And lastly, the opportunity cost. When investing in something, you’re tying money up in to something that you won’t have access to for a certain period of time, therefore where opportunities arise in that period and where the money is tied up, you won’t be able to capitalise on them because you don’t have the funds available, because they’re tied up! Or invested. So on this basis, it is always good practice to understand that, by investing in one of the two opportunities presented, what other opportunities you may be missing out on as a result. For example another opportunity, ‘opportunity #3′ for instance could be a lower returning opportunity that comes with less risk that might work in line with your investment objectives or risk appetite. It could even be similar return, but in a different project that you may know more about. In simple terms, it’s the consideration of any other opportunities that you will miss out on because the money is tied up elsewhere.
  
There are other things that could be taken in to consideration e.g. if the return is fixed or compound based or ensuring the level of reward is proportionate to the level of risk, but I think the above three measures enable any lay person to make a good, considered financial decision, enabling your money to make you richer.

We both expect to be in the area for at least 5 years ideally, but most likely more than that.

Her credit score is lower than mine but has worked in the past year to really put that in line, and we will both be working on our personal credit and putting money towards savings in the next year or so.

**My biggest question is**

* We know that it's smarter / almost necessary to put down 20% when buying a home and hard to get a mortgage without that, but it would take about 5 years to save up for a down payment if we didn't become much more aggressive than we already are with saving. At an estimated interest rate of 4.5%, we would end up paying more on rent in five years (~$54k) than we would in interest on a $190,000 home.  Am I missing something here?  Is there a reason it's worse to be paying into interest on a mortgage than it is to be paying into rent?

* Is there anything else I'm missing out on here, words of caution, or maybe reassurance? We're just starting to research this and aren't about to jump out and buy a house this month, but it's definitely something we've passively talked about for a while and are in the early stages of figuring out pros and cons of this, and learning about everything.",finance,1425333997

This does not include any deductions, such as 401k contributions. My employer matches my 401k contributions up to 5% of my income, and funds are available through Vanguard and TIAA-CREF. I expect to be paying between $1200 and $1600 per month in rent and my commuting costs will be just under $100 per month. I also need to budget for food, entertainment, and utilities. I am very fortunate that I have no debt.

When I move into my first apartment, my parents will be able to loan me the three months of rent required (first month + last month + security deposit) and I already have furniture. I definitely need to pay my parents back at some point, but time is not an issue.

I guess my question is, if I have $1500-$1800 to put towards savings, how should I allocate that money? I am aware that I should definitely contribute 5% of my income to my employer's 401k ($291.66/month), but beyond that, how much should go each month towards the 401k, a Roth IRA, and an emergency fund/savings account? And how should I budget paying back my parents?

Any opinions, thoughts, or experiences are welcome. Thanks!",finance,1425345512

personalfinance,Payday is NOT a special occasion!,"I have seen similar comments on multiple threads here on reddit.  Here are some of your sentence fragments that prompted this post:

&amp;nbsp;

""[I want a treat after working](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2xqt60/payday_is_not_a_special_occasion/cp2rq3m)""  
""When I get paid""  
""My next paycheck""  
""Can't this month""  
""Until I get paid""  

&amp;nbsp;

You get the idea.

&amp;nbsp;

You have said things such as ""On Friday I get paid, and then I'm going to buy [XYZ]!"", or ""and then I'm treating [myself/my friend/my boyfriend] to dinner!""  

There is nothing wrong with treating yourself! If you've earned it, if you need the pick-me-up, if it is a special occasion or you've otherwise planned for it. Payday, however, is not a special occasion.  You have psychologically keyed yourself to expect a reward when you receive an influx of cash - and in doing so, are treating yourself to the *opposite* of sound financial planning.

You earned the money you worked for.  That is why you are getting your paycheck, after all.  You didn't also earn a special occasion just because you have done your job!

If this lump sum payment is the only time each month you are able to buy yourself something you need (or want), and you have no savings, you are living paycheck to paycheck.  I would consider you in severe financial distress.  

The same goes for a tax return, or the months where you get three paychecks if paid biweekly, or an annual bonus.  These non unforseen cash infusions should be fed into your budget, the same as your paycheck - to 1) fund your emergency fund, 2) pay off debt, and 3) save for other goals.

&amp;nbsp;

My advice: please subscribe to /r/eatcheapandhealthy, /r/frugal, /r/fitness, and /r/personalfinance.  Learn from these subreddits.  Read the wiki's, FAQ's, and sidebar's, and make some lifestyle changes.  Spend less than you earn, eat right, and exercise.

Start building yourself an [emergency fund](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/emergencyfunds).  Learn where your money is coming from, and where it is going (https://www.mint.com/).  Give every dollar a job (http://www.youneedabudget.com/).  I'm begging you, please make yourself a budget!

&amp;nbsp;

I don't care if your budget still contains biweekly nights out on the town.  Or art supplies for your hobby.  Make the third Wednesday of every month ""Video Game Wednesday"" where you buy a new game, I really don't care.  Spend the same amount you used to spend on payday (but preferably less!) -

personalfinance,Being hung up on by repeatedly by my bank?,"I received my Wells Fargo savings account statement today and noticed that the amount of interest paid does not match what it should be. I figured out what the amount should be by calculating the beginning balance of the pay period times the interest rate. It was only a couple of cents off but I don't understand why it was wrong in the first place, and I am expecting a bonus soon and will deposit a hefty sum into my savings account and just want to make sure that I won't shortchanged as my balance grows.

So I called Wells Fargo's 1800 number today. The first time I called was on my cell and the customer service rep who picked up had some trouble hearing me. I explained what my call was regarding, and the call disconnected. I assumed this was due to connection issues. 

I called back shortly after using a land line and this time, the customer service rep I spoke with mentioned no issues about connection. As soon as I explained what my issue was (balance times interest rate not equalling amount of interest paid), the call was disconnected.

I realize this seems petty but I wanted to get to the bottom of this because of the principle of it. Now it feels like I was hung up on twice and I don't understand why. I will probably call back and see if I can talk to a manager, but I was just wondering if anyone else has had this sort of issue?",finance,1425352137

It should be known by now that QE is *not* 'printing money' or 'debt monetisation'. As *I* understand it, QE doesn't create new money per se, it merely shuffles the assets the banks hold by giving them reserves in the Fed and taking away government securities. So since increasing bank reserves doesn't change the amount of credit-worthy customers who go to the banks to borrow, how would it even 'inject' liquidity into the system and spur spending? And why would there by hyperinflation fears when no high-powered 'real' money is created? And why did it not work in some places, and appear to work (US Q42014 GDP is up 5% YoY) in other places?

personalfinance,College Financial Aid Cut: How Does my Plan Hold Up?,"I am a student who has been attending a crappy college for 3 quarters. Why am I attending the college if I think it's crappy? Well, up till now, I've been receiving the federal Pell grant and the state (NJ) TAG grant, which in combination with my presidential (half-tuition) scholarship, grant me a full ride. However, now that the current quarter is nearing its end, I've learned that those financial aid programs will not cover my fourth (Spring) quarter. The reason for this is that they're only given in 3 disbursements over the academic year, and I've already depleted all 3. This would not be the case if my current college operates on a semester basis like every other institution.

My original plan was to remain at the current college until the Summer, and transfer to a better University (I've already applied to several, and believe I have a good chance of being accepted). Now, realizing that plan has become more complicated.

Arriving at this predicament, I weighted three options:

1. Scramble together the 2.5K to pay the balance for the upcoming Spring quarter

2. Take out loans to pay the 2.5K balance for the upcoming Spring quarter

3. Take the Spring quarter off and then:

a. reapply for the Pell and TAG grants for the Summer quarter, and transfer afterwards (Which would mean that after transfer, I could receive financial aid for only two semesters at the new school for that academic year).

b. take the Summer quarter off too, and transfer afterwards (the benefit here would be that I would qualify for three semesters of financial aid at the new school and could use the 6 months free time to pursue a job in my field and build my portfolio; the downside would be that I wouldn't be earning any credits).

I am leaning towards option #3, but haven't decided between a and b yet. I'm wandering whether someone could give me some advice regarding this matter, and tell me if perhaps there are other possible options which I haven't considered.

Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Looking for Guidance,"I am looking for some guidance on how to get my finances under control. I have a girlfriend (we've been together for several years), a 3 year old girl, and another child on the way. I have a decent paying job and my girlfriend is currently working part time. She makes enough money to pay for daycare, groceries (most of them), and whatever her expenses are (I don't know what they all are) with the exception of her student loans.  

I get paid bi-weekly, but I won't include the two extra paychecks (May and November) in the numbers I list. After putting 5% into my 401k (my employer matches 50% for the first 5% and 25% after up to 10%), taxes, and insurance I get paid $2500 the first paycheck of the month (includes a $70 cell phone stipend which is taxed) and $2480 for the second paycheck of the month.  

Last year I had to pay back a $7000 bonus from a job I decided to leave. I used the money on relocation expenses as well as a down payment on a home. I also just paid the remaining balance, $4000, of a loan from my girlfriend's mom.  

Here are my current expenses:

$1100 mortgage (~$147,885.. 4.5% interest rate)  
$383 auto loan (~$15,745.. 2.6% interest rate.. currently pay $200 a month bi-weekly)  
$300 credit card (~$8,500.. 9.99% interest rate)  
$200 credit card (~$8,500.. 15.99% interest rate)  
$320 private student loan (~$62,500.. 3.36% interest rate)  
$130 federal student loan (~$7,250.. 2.625% interest rate)  
$60 auto insurance  
$225 electric and gas  
$42 water  
$58 internet (not the cheapest, but not the most expensive.. I work from home and do a lot of video conferencing.)
$170 cell phone (part of the bill is paid for by my employer (taxed) and $30 of it is for my girlfriend's mom's bill which is part of my repayment of the loan)  
$70 gym membership  

I also pay my girlfriend's student loans which are another $375 a month. I could break them all down if necessary. Here they are since I am sure someone will ask.

$17 (~$2,151.. interest rate 6.5%)  
$28 (~$4,184.. interest rate 4%)  
$28 (~$4,184.. interest rate 4%)

$71 (~$8,919.. interest rate 6.5%)

H&amp;R Block is supposedly going to allow me to freely e-file my federal and state returns because my income is low enough and my states are on the 'free' list. We'll see when I finally get to checkout.

For the f***ing life of me, I cannot figure out how to get it to apply the income taxes I paid in one state as a credit to the other. How do I get it to apply the credit correctly? I have reentered and tried to tweak different boxes/sections of the state return and it still comes out wrong.

I paid $1,221 in income taxes in the state I worked. I paid $0 in income taxes to my resident state. I usually have to pay a few extra dollars to my resident state each year because it has slightly higher taxes. When I run everything through TurboTax, this comes out to a value I expect--I owe $17 to my resident state (and the federal final value matches). H&amp;R Block tells me I owe $789, which cannot be right. It's not crediting the taxes I paid in my work state. I can't figure out how to fix it/get it to work right.

My wife holds $54K in student loans.  
I have a loan for $20K on a vehicle(recent purchase, 6 months ago)
I have a personal loan for school expenses, at $2700.  (10% interest)
We have, combined, $1500 in credit card debt.
We rent half a house for $700, utilities included.
$23,000 Cash in the bank, plus a $1000(and growing by $100+/mo) investment account.  I would consider it a big no-no to change the investment schedule.
On the low end, our combined take home income is around $5k(I work on commission, some months are better and some are worse, but our last-years income combined was $89,000)

I know that's a little light on details, but here's the question anyway:  How do you balance ""bucket list"" items with budgeting and saving?  I'd like to buy a motorcycle and take a cross country trip with my brother this summer.  It's something I've wanted to do for a long time, but I don't want to ruin my financial future, either.  I'd anticipate the trip, including purchase of the motorcycle, to be around $4500.  It's not my first bike and I am handy, so I'd definitely be buying used.  I have no delusions about being someone who 'saves money' owning a bike.  I frequently talk people down from that mistake.  It's pretty much all about the trip for me.

I see it playing out two different ways.  Either I buy the bike cash, and dedicate more monthly income to paying down debt, or I pay off that $2700 loan, and replace it with a short-term motorcycle loan of a similar value.  That would drop the interest rate on that much debt from 10% to 2%.

In the past, I've hunted for good deals on bikes and sold them the next year to break even/small profit on them.  I've got a couple lined up like that, but I have a tendency to get excited about an idea and jump on it.  I'm looking for a devils advocate, I guess.",finance,1425392704

His dad has been using my boyfriend's Paypal account for years to flip things he finds at thrift stores. What I understand is that a long time ago, he was scammed by a buyer that claimed he never received an expensive item. At that point, his dad started using my boyfriend's accounts. 

So last night, my bf got on the phone with someone from the IRS and said he failed to report ~$22,000 in 2012. He owes the federal government ~$7,000 and the state ~$1,400 – they told him if he doesn't pay by Friday (March 6) they will levy his bank account. They couldn't tell him what he was going to owe for 2013 or 2014.

From what I can figure online, in 2012 Paypal started reporting income to the IRS if it was more than 200 transactions or more than $20,000. He called his dad last night, who said he would go through his records because he didn't actually make $22,000, since he was buying things and reselling them. 

We are so scared and lost right now. Does anybody have advice about what we should do next?

I’m 24 years old and currently make $44,471 annually which comes out to about $2,300 per month after taxes, 401k, healthcare deductions, etc.  My bills are $625 for rent, ~$50 utilities, $65 phone bill, $100 for public transportation, $100 month per gas (I own a car but only drive occasionally), I put about $500 a month in savings, and approx. $850 toward spending money.  
I have no credit card debt or student loans. I own an old car, don’t overspend beyond my means, and have about $15,000 in savings. 


I work in education and enjoy my current position but am realizing more and more that there is no room for growth in my company or what I’m doing. I have an interest in transitioning into human resources which seems to be quite difficult without experience. I have been applying for new jobs for the last month or so and was offered a position within a nursing home that pays $40,000 a year and the health benefits are fairly shitty. I pay about $180 a month for healthcare right now and have a $20 co-pay and overall fantastic benefits which is important because I have had health issues in the past.  It seems as though the new plan is a HMO with Humana with higher fees and limited coverage (I also read that I would not be allowed to have a secondary insurance plan which I currently have through my dad.) 


In my mind, I’m thinking that I should still take this position because it pays better compared to the other entry level HR jobs. I also don’t think that going from $44,000 to $40,000 is a huge financial dent in a long term sense because I will be learning a lot of transferable skills that will make me more marketable down the line.

personalfinance,Should I refinance Student Loans (7% Interest and 40k Debt),"Hey all,

Long time lurker, just had a question about some student loans.  I currently have 40k in student loans, 20k @ 7.65% is Parent Plus and not in my name.  The other 20k @6 .375% is in my name and is a federal loan.

I have seen sites offering to refinance for anywhere between 3.5-5%.  I currently have been paying about 500 a month while paying down some old credit cards, but will have those finished in 3 months.  Is it worth refinancing or should I just increase my monthly payment when I can.

personalfinance,Taxes: Help avoiding underpayment penalty.,"I just filed my taxes following my first full year of employment after college and I ended up owing both state (Utah) and federal tax. :(


The two combined were less than $200, but I understand there's a penalty if you owe in two consecutive years.


How can I avoid owing next year without completely overcompensating and getting a huge return?

Also, is there an underpayment penalty for state income tax? I would hope not, since I've never heard of state withholding.


Some background:
I'm single, have no dependents, I rent my home, and my taxable salary is a little under 60k. I claim the standard deduction on my taxes.

I have 15k in taxable investments, and 25k earning interest in a credit union savings account. I contribute 25% of my net income towards these and will be shifting more of the total into investments soon.


I suspect that interest/dividends from these sources are what made me come up short on my withholdings.",finance,1425401960

personalfinance,Adjust withholdings to take entire paycheck,"I'm going to try this again, since many of the responses ranged from tin foil hat stuff to assumptions that I'm trying to hide income.  I'm trying to do no such thing.  Let me ask the question again, this time with some clarifying information.

How do I fill out my W4 so that my entire net pay is federal withholdings, making my take-home pay zero? Assume that my gross pay is quite variable from one pay period to the next.

Why do I want to do this?  I have a full-time job -- there's nothing unusual about it salary or tax-wise.  I'm about to start a part-time job that's seasonal, sporadic, isn't going to net me a huge amount of money (&lt; $1,000 for the year), and issues paper checks.  Because of the sporadic nature of the job, there's no telling when I can pick up these checks.  I thought I might be able to do this:

* Make all net pay from that job withheld, so that I have zero take-home pay.
* Slightly reduce the withholdings on my regular job.

The net result is that I don't have to deal with paper checks from the PT job, but my withholdings are approximately the same.

OK, maybe this is a horrible idea for some reason I'm not thinking about, but this is why I'm coming to /r/personalfinance for advice.  I'd like to know how I can accomplish this, and now I suppose I'm asking why this might be a bad idea.  I'm fine if you want to tell me it's a stupid idea -- but if you don't mind, let's remove the assumptions of malfeasance and the tin foil hat BS.

personalfinance,Credit Unions are awesome,"I read a lot of posts here about insanely high interest auto loans (just now, one at 8.75%). A lot of this has to do with credit score obviously, and a bunch more has to do with simply not shopping around enough or finding out ALL the options you have to borrow. To address the second point there, I just wanted to pass along my recent experience. 

We were in the market for a car. We could pay cash, but with rates as low as they were, I shopped around. I have very good credit (&gt;770, wife &gt;840). The lowest bank rate I was quoted was 2.24% from Chase - and mainly because I am already a customer there (I think a total in 0.5% lower than their usual 5 year rate). I was also oddly rejected outright by PNC Bank. 

I went to my local credit union - and was quoted an astounding 1.45%. On top of that, with a loan balance of &gt;25k, I qualify to earn 3% interest on all checking balances up to 25k, and 0.5% thereafter. With two people on the loan (my wife and I) that's a maximum of $50k that we can have earning 3% for as long as the loan is &gt;25k. For people who get mortgages with the credit union, that's a lot of cheddar. 

TL;DR: insanely low interest rate at 1.45%, 3% interest on checking account at local credit union.",finance,1425402713

personalfinance,Should my dad refinance his FHA Loan to get rid of the Mortgage Insurance,"My dad bought a house in 10/2012. It is a 30 year FHA loan with mortgage insurance. Not sure how much he initially put down, it was not a lot, maybe 5%. 

Interest rate is 3.25%. 
Current Balance: $312,000
Initial balance: $340,000

He pays $500 more than the minimum $2,700 a month a month. Mortgage insurance (included in the $2,700) is $331 a month.

Not sure what the current value of the house is, but the identical unit (same floor plan) down the street sold for $440,000 last month.

He has good credit and only 1 other debt (car payment which should be paid off in the next 4 months). He makes good money and his only real luxury is he eats out quite often. My fiance and I are trying to get him to think about retirement. He's way behind in saving for retirement (he's 53 and I only last month convinced him to contribute to his 401(k) at least to the amount that his employer matches).

I filed his taxes last week and he is getting $10,000 back which I am hoping I can get him to put into retirement savings.

He has about six months worth of expenses in the bank, but it is not set apart from his other money so if he sees something he wants to buy all he sees is his account balance and so he'll dip into that on a whim, but that is another issue.

personalfinance,Help with more nitty gritty of house buying?,"Ok, I'm trying to read a bunch of stuff to make sure I'm informed fully, but it's just stressing me out and I just want to make sure I have everything straight.

My husband and I are planning on buying a house very soon.  This afternoon I'll be calling back one bank to hopefully get pre-approved.  So, shit is getting real.

Here's the thing though, I don't know exactly how much money we need for all the other random stuff - like closing costs, realtors, inspectors, etc.  We've got $40k in the bank - and that's everything.  Emergency fund, savings, everything.  (we've got retirement savings as well - currently I don't even think about those so I don't know how much we've got in there, but that doesn't matter.  It's not going to be touched) 

We're looking at houses in the $150k range.  So for 10% down, and given a 4% interest rate (which appears to be the most common rate given our credit rating, etc.) we're still left with $25k. 

Additonally, our (pre-tax) income is ~$130k/year.  Our take home yearly after takes and ~20% towards retirement is ~$40800 and as of right now, our expenses are about $25-30k a year.

We've found a few houses on zillow that are all within the $120-160k range that we'd like to check out.

In our area, that gives you move-in-ready house.  (for example, [here's](http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/4123-Mahoney-St-Portage-MI-49002/74124169_zpid/) one I've been considering) Sometimes the house doesn't come with all the appliances (like the one linked above doesn't have fridge, washer, or dryer) but it's pretty cheap here.

For a $150k house, people say that you should budget $3000-$7500 for closing costs, and $500 for an inspection.  It seems that I won't have to pay a realtor?  Why and how?

So with maybe $5000 budgeted for the random stuff that always comes up when you're buying a house, that's maybe $15k for the closing costs, inspector, and random ""you got a house without a fridge and now you need to buy one""

So, that's now 40k - 15k (random stuff) - 15k (downpayment) = 10k

The monthly payment should be about the same as our current rent with taxes, etc. (we currently pay ~$1000/mo, and as best as I can estimate with taxes and homeowners insurance, it'll be about the same with a $150k house, 4% interest rate, 10% down)

$10k would be our emergency fund.  Is that crazy talk?  Do we need to save up some more before buying a house?",finance,1425409044
personalfinance,Recently laid-off....invest in IRA or pay off student loans?,"I'm in my mid-20s, living in a major metro, and was laid off about 5 weeks ago. Since then, I've filed for unemployment and follow a frugal budget. However, my severance package recently expired so I now have no health insurance. I've begun reaching out to the state for assistance but somebody with experience about assistance programs informed me that I likely won't get approved since I have a large amount of money in my checking &amp; savings (~$15k combined). Unfortunately, almost $3k of that is planned for bills over the next few months (live in a major metro with 3 months left on my lease) but there doesn't seem to be a way for the state to account for that. 

In addition, I have ~$4k from a 401k that I'm thinking to roll over into a traditional IRA with Vanguard (I'm considering traditional since I'm unsure which tax bracket I'll be grouped in with my future job - if it turns out to be a low bracket, I'll likely switch to a Roth IRA before the end of the year).

Lastly, I have about $20k in student loans (paying $300 monthly for the next 7 years) with various interest rates (some loans as high as 7%), that are frustrating the heck out of me. I never realized how much I'm paying for interest - 30% of my recent payments have been allocated toward interest. I realize that will decrease over time, with more of my monthly payments going toward the principal but it's still hard to stomach.

So here is my question - After rolling my 401k into an IRA, should I take $5,500 from my savings (leaving me ~$5k for emergencies) and put that into IRA for 2014 since I still have a few weeks to do so OR should I take around the same amount and put it toward my loans with the highest interest rates?

business,Is the US national debt an illusion?,"I tend to agree with many of the forward-thinking viewpoints that are shared on Reddit. However, I feel there is misinformation being circulated regarding the US national debt. The core question that must be answered: What is the national wealth?

Private wealth in the US is almost $70 trillion. But dig deeper: What is the mineral wealth in our national parkland? What are the Rocky Mountains, Mendocino County, and ANWR worth? What is the aggregate oil wealth in public lands? What is the value of the US military in the jungle of international relations?

I argue that the $18 Trillion national debt pales in comparison to the national wealth of the United States. There is no better example of this than the revenue generated from Obama's successful energy exploration campaign.

When you take a look at the massive swaths of valuable land held by the federal government, it becomes clear that the total federally-owned real estate, oil, minerals, etc. within the borders of the USA could be valued in the quadrillions of dollars.

One thing has become increasingly clear to me: the United States HAS debt, but it is really not IN debt.

The purpose of the Federal Reserve is to govern the people through the money supply. The threat of hyperinflation or deflationary depression is exaggerated. The resource wealth of the United States - as well as the large, rich, taxable population - provides a backstop that keeps our currency strong, even in expansionary environments.

I believe this backstop is far more valuable than prior generations' use of precious metal reserves. I concede gold and silver are more tangible, but defining the national wealth by reserves of scarce metals is nothing more than a form of social brainwashing intended to keep resource-rich Americans feeling poor.

Conspiracy theorists and John Birchers who measure the national debt against gold reserves are engaging in monetary child's play. However, the Federal Reserve's ability to spend the past decade in crisis while hiding the money supply (M3) from the American public is brilliant. A brilliant scam that must come to an end in the United States, as it has in central banks throughout Europe and across the globe.

The strength of the dollar in FOREX markets in the wake of QE3 invalidates many conspiracy theories. As a market student and participant, I believe the dollar is legitimately strong and would remain strong through QE4, QE5, and QE6.

Is it time to end the myth of false scarcity? Is the easy answer - a dramatic increase in the debt ceiling to fund the Small Business Administration, Farm Service Agency, and regional banks - the best path for the US economy?

Recently an interesting statistic was released. The USA has fewer corporations today than 40 years ago, despite having three times as many citizens. If ""corporations are people,"" do we just need more ""people?""

Or is a multi-decade Japanese-style depression a better way to break the will of American men, break the daughters of the revolution into prostitution, seize American's weapons, and ultimately rejoin the British Crown and join the New/Old World Order?

I ask that question only half-sarcastically, because that appears to be the the intent of the current world order, and the path the Untied States is headed. Especially if either Hillary ""Forester de Rothschild-RHODam"" Clinton, or Jeb ""Lehman is now Barclays"" Bush are elected president.

This is serious business.

Sure, a new monetary system would be nice. But is a total revolution possible? Perhaps it is time to submit to reality, and finally admit that Reagan was right.

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of a new hashtag.

personalfinance,Options for takings over / refinancing parent PLUS loans?,"I graduated in 2013 and my father took out a parent PLUS loan.

I've been paying it off for two years now, but I'd rather have that loan under my name somehow.

I realize that parent PLUS loans are under the parent's name and are non-transferable, however would it at all be possible for me to apply for a loan to pay off the PLUS loan so that I'd have that loan under my name?

Alternatively would it be possible to refinance the parent PLUS any way? I understand this would need to be done by my parent.

Either way, I guess I'm looking to reduce the interest rate (it's at 7.65) as well as get credit for paying off my loans and get the tax break for doing so.

Any ideas? Thanks.",finance,1425431133
personalfinance,Debt Problem - Should I sell my house or try to settle my debts? (Canada),"My wife and I bought a place about 5 years ago when she was still in school.  We wanted to buy a place we would be at for a long time, so we bought the most expensive house we could get approved for on my income.  We have kids, and we knew we'd get into debt while she finishes school, but only anticipated about $20K worth of student debt at low interest rates.  Well, one thing led to another, and it ended up taking her almost two extra years to finish her schooling.  That's two extra years of no income, and two extra years of expenses.  Student loans are now about $50K, and we have about another $60K in credit card debt.

We could probably sell the house today for about $460K, and there is $360K owed on it.  So there's a fair bit of equity, but not enough where we could tap into enough of it to help us out.

Our net income (take home) is about $7,400 per month.  Our ""necessary"" expenses total about $5,500 per month (includes mortgage, property tax, condo fees, utilities, car payment, insurance, gas, cell phones, cable, internet, food, etc).  That also includes some tuition for courses we are taking (I'm doing my MBA, and she's upgrading in her field).  Her student loan payments are about $650 per month, and the credit card interest alone is about $1,000 per month.  As you can see, our expenses basically match our income - and that's without anything ""extravagent"" (trips, going out, etc).

While we may be able to cut back on some things - could probably trade in our car for something cheaper to reduce that payment, nor do we need to be in school.  I guess cell phones/tv/internet aren't 100% necessary.  But cutting back on these things wouldn't make enough of a dent in our expenses to make a difference.

What bothers me is that based on our current cash flow situation, we can afford to live comfortably where we are.  It's just the debt that is dragging us down.  I can afford to pay the interest, but I can't afford to pay it down.

Lastly, I recently started a new job.  It is with a start up, and they are paying me what I was earning in my old role, but are giving me an additional 30% of my salary in stock options (which I can't use until 2017).  We are off to a flying start, and while it is still risky, I'm confident we will do well.  That being said, I think I'm worth about 20% more on the market than the base salary they are paying me (just no stock options).

Our current options:
1) Do nothing/Wait it out:  We could continue to pay our bills, do nothing exciting, and just maintain the level of debt, and hope that my company takes off (even a little), in which case my salary WILL go up substantially, and I can cash in on my stock options.  Also, my tuition will not be an expense in 12 months, and we've got 36 months of car payments left (minor wins).

2) Call up my creditors and try to settle the debts: I value my credit rating, and apart from my high utilization, my credit is great.  I don't know if my/our creditors would accept a settlement offer, nor do I know if I want to take that hit on my credit rating.

3) Sell the house: We could sell our house, and use the equity to pay off virtually all of our debt.  If we did this, I would probably rent a place for a year or two, to get used to proper budgeting again, and to save for a down payment.  We would likely end up buying right back in our neighborhood, so it seems like a waste of money to pay realtor fees, etc.

I really wish I could just refinance at 100% LTV, and while there's some lenders who would be open to this, the interest rate would likely be 10%+, and I don't want that.

My wife and I are both saddled with &gt;250K in student loans. ugh... but the light for us is we are both repaying under loan forgiveness for public service employees, with income based repayment plans. When filing jointly for a tax year, the PLSF plan calculates your combined household income, no matter if one or both have fed loans as the source for determining repayment amounts. Where we disagree is whether to file married but separate and keep our repayment costs low (individual incomes now calculate repayment) but annual tax payment high, or the opposite and reduce yearly annual tax and suffer a higher monthly rate. As the PLSF plan nulls any remaining loan balance after 120 payments, I argue keep repayment to the absolute minimum. In addition, lower repayment save us close to 3000 annually after paying taxes.

Today, I’m just asking for a check-up.

*$2,540 monthly net income (after benefits + Roth TSP contributions)

*$700 into savings ($10k emergency fund + $3,300 “other” savings currently)

*$650 rent (including all utilities except internet)

*$80 car insurance

*$80 Gas (generally I spend less)

*$200 Groceries

*$25 Haircut

*$180ish Cash/Flex Spending/Fun/Travel (long distance relationship)


Student loans and vehicle are my only debt.  Any credit card use is paid off in full monthly.  I don’t systemically budget in advance for dr’s visits, car maintenance, etc., but just take out of “other” savings.

FICO Credits Score currently in the 830s.  I have two active credit cards (Chase Freedom &amp; Citi ThankYou Preferred), but almost exclusively use the Chase.  (I’ve had the Citi forever, so haven’t cancelled it because I don’t want to adversely affect my account age &amp; FICO score).

I’m a federal employee.  I have solid health, dental, and vision benefits, and also have $180/month going to a Roth TSP, with a 5% employer match (which is the max match).

I’m paying minimums on an income based repayment plan on student loans, and plan on Public Service Loan Forgiveness (I’m 4 years in, with 6 years of payments remaining).  (Yeah, I know $50k is a lot relative to my income, but grad school, recession…..)

My goal this year is getting my “other” savings up to $10k, and then putting $10k into a CD.  I’m semi-planning on a job change (+$7k gross) sometime this summer.  I’m vaguely starting to consider buying a house 3-5 years out, and would like to get closer to a down-payment sooner rather than later.  (I work for a land-management agency and move every 3-5 years.  Some areas don’t have a healthy rental market, so buying is the only option).  Also, when I get that “other” savings to $10k I plan on regularly contributing to a few non-profits and joining a few professional orgs.
 
So, questions:  
*Anything in the above that you’d change or improve upon? 

*When I do get to $10k savings, is a CD the advised route?

personalfinance,THANK YOU and request for advice on credit card payoff - specific order to pay down balances.,"First of all, please let me shout a big THANK YOU to /r/personalfinance.  I'm a recovering credit addict, and thanks to yo guys my husband and I have taken what I think is a great start to reform our out of control finances.

Our monthly spending is high, due in part to lack of discipline but in part to an expensive hobby (we have a horse; I know, I know).  We deliberately chose a VERY modest mortgage/HOA payment for our income to allow us to afford the horse if we live frugally.  Problem is, we hadn't actually been living frugally.

So, we've done some things well: (1) Switched to the envelope system and love it; our money arguments are significantly reduced as a result.  (2) We've accumulated an emergency fund so that we don't have to look to credit for a car repair bill, vet bill, health insurance deductible, etc. (3) We've done a sophisticated budget that annualizes known expenses like the horse's major medical policy, and other large annual payments, to create a specific savings plan; we're now saving 10% of our net monthly income, though some of that is going to savings-for-expenses not savings-for-wealth.

Anyway, we had well over $25,000 of consumer debt (I know, we know it's a problem and it's one we're taking significant steps to solve).  We used a home equity loan to manage some of it, taking $10,000 from 24.99% to 1.89% with tax deductible interest.  

I am aware of the snowball method and the pay-highest-interest first methods, but I cannot figure out how to apply them to the following debts.  My goals are to take advantage of introductory or promotional interest rates where I can, and pay off the debts in the way that minimizes interest.

Here's what I have, as of today:

(1) Credit card 1: $2,187 at 24.99% (++) now 0% for 12 months

(2) Credit card 2: $2,176 at 20.99%

(3) Credit card 3: $1,880 at 24.99% (++) now 0% for 12 months

(4) Best Buy card: $820 which is 0% until August 30, 2015

(5) Home Depot card: $450 which is 0% until June 30, 2015

(6) Pay Pal Credit: Revolving balance, presently $235 at 0%

Because of the promotional balances, neither highest-rate-first nor snowball makes perfect sense.  Also, as of today, I have transferred the two cards marked (++) to a new card with a promotional balance transfer rate of 0% for 12 months. The card's limit allowed me to transfer only 2 of the 3 generic cards, so I chose the highest rate ones.

**Of course we are no longer using any of these cards; we are all cash.**

Would love some specific instructions on what order to pay down these balances in a method aimed to pay the least interest over time.  We can allocate about $700 per month overall to pay these balances, and I'd love guidance about how to most effectively use it.  We look forward to saving that $700 per month instead of paying consumer debt with it.

Thanks and sorry this is so long.  I'm a little excited about the changes that we are making, and the anxiety they are reducing.  I say to husband almost weekly how much better I feel, even if we are going out to dinner less, buying things less, shopping from thrift stores, etc.  

After payoff of debt the next goal is to accumulate 3 months of savings in cash, then thereafter additional savings for conservative investments.  Am also contributing to 401(k) and to child's college fund.  Have life, disability and long term care insurance (I'm sole breadwinner for the family, with 90% of the income even when husband works).

**Edited to add, I left out a key piece of information!!  Both the Best Buy and Home Depot cards have a trick to them, where if I don't pay down the balance by the end of the promotion time, it's not that interest will simply start accruing at that time but **I will have all the back interest tacked on to the balance.**  Best Buy caught me like this once in the past, so I'm very careful about that now.",finance,1425433831
personalfinance,Resident Alien Au Pair Tax Question,"My girlfriend is an [Au Pair](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Au-Pairs), and is trying to file her taxes for 2014. She does not quality as a non-resident because she has been in the U.S. multiple times over the last 5 years, meeting the [substantial presence test](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Substantial-Presence-Test). We can try to check if she meets the ""[Closer Connection Exception](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Conditions-for-a-Closer-Connection-to-a-Foreign-Country)"", but it seems like a bit of a long shot based on the requirements.

So, assuming she doesn't meet the exception, we believe she is considered a resident alien '[Household Employee](http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc756.html)'. And owes Social and Medicare taxes, as well as Federal and State Income tax, etc.

The problem I see is that the Au Pair agency has never heard of this, and there was no W-4 filed in 2014 between the employer (host family) and my girlfriend, and no taxes were withheld from her paychecks or paid by the employer ([who should be paying a share,](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p926.pdf) according to page 4 table A), as far as we are aware.

So, we're annoyed that the agency never noticed this, or even made an effort to educate the au pairs about doing their taxes at all, which is risky because they could be denied future visas into the USA. And if we're right that the host family should be paying half of the Social and Medicare according to the rules for hiring Household Employees, then they are naturally going to be upset that they were blindsided by this.

Online, I have found a few references to the rare instance of an au pair being considered a resident alien, but very few actual examples or stories that I can use for confirmation. We're taking this info to an accountant later this week, but I've been reading over the IRS site all day and I'm curious to see if anyone can confirm my thinking, or shed some light on what should actually be happening.

If anyone knows more about taxes than me, please let me know if the above sounds right, or if I'm just completely off base.",finance,1425435129

I'm keen to ensure my kids learn now what I wish I'd known 30 years ago (they are late teen/early 20s).  Since they don't live at home any more I'd like to give them some guidelines to help them understand the basics.  I've read the blogs and books recommended here, and, while they present a good message, to be honest they are difficult to read even if you're already motivated, and too long winded to get my kids interested.  To help get them started I've compiled my hours and hours of reading into the following 2 page guide - I'd be very interested in feedback on content and/or anything I should add.

Note: I'm in Aus so the superannuation stuff is AU specific.


**Mindset**

* Financial independence means you are free to pursue your own interests, rather than those of an employer.  You might still work, but you don’t have to.
* Set financial goals, and map out a plan to achieve them.  Review them regularly, and monitor your progress towards them.
* Motivation will get you over the start line, but it’s discipline that will get you to the finish line.

**Budgeting**

* You must have a budget.  You must stick to it.  If it’s not in the budget don’t buy it.
* Live well below your means.  Spend as little as possible, earn as much as possible. 
* Open at least 4 bank accounts (make sure they are fee-free accounts)
 -  Everyday account – receives your wages, used for everyday purchases like groceries.
 -  Expense account – transfer money every fortnight for routine bills like rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance, car maintenance.   Your employer can probably deposit your pay across two or more accounts.  Don’t touch this account except for bill payments, and set up direct debits and automatic payments where possible.  For irregular bills (eg gas, electricity) check them against your budgeted amount when they come in, and top up if necessary.  Automation is the key for this account.
 -  Savings account – put money in here for short term goals like holidays, car purchase, house deposit. 
 -  Investment account – your financial independence account.  Put as much as possible here, and don’t touch it except to move it to higher returning investments.
* You also need an emergency fund, equal to 6 months expenses (work this out from your budget).  Only use this for real emergencies that will affect your quality of life (fridge repairs, medical bills, car repairs, lost your job etc).  If you have a mortgage with redraw facility, keep it in there to reduce interest on the mortgage.  If not get a high interest cash account and keep it there.

**Saving**

* Save as much as possible then look for ways to save a bit more.  Every dollar counts.
* Compound interest means you make money on the interest you earn as well as your original money.  The reverse is true for debt.
* Realise that if your savings/investments are earning less than inflation, you are losing money.  Higher returns usually mean higher risks, but there are relatively safe options that return higher than inflation.
* You need 25 times your annual expenses invested to be financially independent practically indefinitely.  This lets you withdraw 4% of earnings to live on, so the investment returning 7% long term will keep up with inflation.  
* Reducing your expenses by living more economically reduces the amount you need to be FI.
* Reducing expenses is 100% money in your pocket, tax free.  That money can then start earning you more money in investments.   Loans paid off (eg mortgage) return whatever the interest rate is, tax free. 
 
**Investing**

* Your employer must pay 9.5% of your gross salary into your chosen superannuation fund, but this probably won’t be enough for a comfortable retirement so you’ll need to add to it.  You also can’t access it until you turn 60 so you’ll need other investments to retire early.
* Superannuation contributed via salary sacrifice can save a lot of tax, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.  Super is taxed inside the fund at 15%, whereas the top tax bracket will be 39% or 47% for top earners.  So if you salary sacrifice to super, you pay less tax for the same income, since the super is taken out before tax.  
Eg If you salary sacrifice $1000 to super and you are in the 39% bracket you will pay $390 less income tax, so your take home pay will only drop by $610.  Your $1000 will then be taxed down to $850 in your fund.  Just to be clear – your pay has dropped by $610, but your super has increased by $850. The tax office has effectively given you $240, which is now earning 7-8% or so for you. 
Your earnings are also taxed at 15% in your super fund - if invested outside super the earnings will be taxed at your nominal tax rate, or 39% in the example above.
* Outside super, invest in index funds (such as Vanguard) don’t try to play the share market.
* Use periodic investing – this just means constantly investing rather than trying to time the investment of lump sums.  You will be buying some shares at a high value, and some at a low value, depending on the timing, but it will average out over time.
* Diversify your portfolio to minimise risk.  The Bogleheads WIKI (link below) is an excellent guide.

**Borrowing**

* Only borrow money that makes or saves money.  Eg Mortgage (saves rent, gains equity), business loan (start a business to make money), student loan (get a higher paying career).  If the loan costs more in interest than the investment returns, reconsider the investment.
* An asset is something that makes/saves money and/or increases in value.  A house is usually an asset - it saves rent and increases in value over time.  A car is rarely an asset – it costs money to run, and it depreciates in value every day.  Only borrow for an asset (that means no car loan).
* Never carry a balance on a credit card past the due date.  Make the most of the reward points and interest free days if you like, but ALWAYS pay the balance by the due date.
* Interest free offers on whitegoods, electronics etc. usually (always?) involve a more expensive initial purchase price to cover the interest.  Read the fine print.

**Lifestyle**

* Don’t follow the crowd.  Most of your neighbours with flash cars and boats and big houses also have huge debt and will be working until they are 70. 
* Advertising is designed to convince you to give your money to someone else for something you probably don’t need.  Don’t fall for it, you are smarter than the advertisers.  Decide for yourself what you do and don’t need.
* Realise though that it’s ok to buy stuff you want but don’t need – just be aware that it is not essential and spend appropriately.  Stay focused on your goals.
* A $300k well-designed home in a decent neighbourhood will keep you just as warm, dry, safe, and comfortable as a $1M home.  The $700k difference is literally enough to retire on.  Choose where you live carefully.
* Choose a life partner who has similar financial goals to you.  Preferably independent of your finances, but at least equally contributing.  
* Study finance.  Read books on financial freedom and investing.  Visit and participate in finance forums.  Make it a hobby.  A very rewarding hobby.

personalfinance,Should I take out more student loan money and put it into my Roth IRA?,"Hello everybody, first post here but have seen some excellent advice here before and I like that it's a medium to get many different opinions. 

My question: would it be smart for a student who will finish med school with ~$250k in debt, but go into a high-paying specialty, to take on an extra $16.5k in student loan debt to put into a Roth IRA? 

My situation: Ill be 30 y/o this summer and I'm 2nd year medical school student currently ~$133k in debt (undergrad + current med school debt). After living in a rented apartment for my first 2 yrs of med school, I decided to move back in with my parents to save ~$6-7k on rent and utilities (should have done it before, but you know how living with family can be and wasn't ready for that). I have another 3 years (I had to take a medical leave so I will be delayed by 1 year, but I still lost the money I paid for the fall) and I intend on going into a field that has very high pay but only after a 7 yr residency (during which I'll make $50-60k). I have had a Roth IRA for ~5 years now that only has ~2,200 since I haven't been able to afford putting in more over time. However, it has been growing at a rate of about 8.5% since I started, even through the recession. 

Pros and Cons: Given my IRA's growth rate of 8.5% and my student loan interest rate of about 6-7% (fluctuates a little every year), I considered taking out an additional $5500 in loans to maximize my IRA contributions, presumably a long-term net gain. I'm also tempted to do this since it's really time in the market that matters. I'm already 30, and I'd really like to start getting my investments going as much as I can. However, I'm also aware that my long residency will result in a large amount of accrued interest. Also, although ""medical school debt forgiveness"" programs forgive the remainder of your debt after paying for 10 years (including residency), changes are being made so that it's uncertain as to whether or not this forgiveness program will be around (or if there will be a max limit) when I actually finish med school. 

Thanks in advance for your help and feel free to ask additional questions.",finance,1425454910

personalfinance,Student Loans: Am I Doing the Avalanche Method Right?,"I graduated with about $150,000 in student loan debt (had to pay undergrad, law school, and then loans capitalized as I was looking for a job...but it's time to look forward and get these paid off). 

I am enrolled in IBR, but my minimum payment is extremely low--$78.00 (based on last year's extremely minimal income). Thus, I pretty much have complete freedom to pay towards any loan I want. 

The counter to this, however, is that my minimum payments on each loan are extremely low. For instance, one $23,000 loan at 6.55% interest has a minimum payment of $11.00. That means interest would balloon substantially if I didn't pay more than the minimum payment each month. 

Thus, for right now, I'm trying to cover the accruing interest on each loan each month, plus a little more, then throwing everything at my highest interest rate loan.

Here is the loan/payment breakdown (can only afford $1,003 total):

1) Plus Loan: $7339.46 @ 6.16%; accrues $37.16 monthly interest; payment = $40.00

2) Plus Loan: $21,067.34 @ 6.16%; accrues $106.66 monthly interest; payment = $110.00

3) Ubsubsidized Stafford Loan: $21,899.47 @ 5.16%; accrues $92.88 monthly interest; payment = $100.00

4) Plus Loan: $27,481.16 @ 7.65%; accrues $172.79 monthly interest; payment = $385.00 (max leftover).

5) Unsubsidized Stafford Loan: $23,634.92 @ 6.55%; accrues $127.24 monthly interest; payment = $140.00

6) Plus Loan: $8,395.07 @ 7.65%; accrues $52.79 monthly interest; payment = $60.00

7) Unsubsidized Stafford Loan: $14,676.24 @ 6.55%; accrues $79.01 monthly interest; payment = $90.00

8) Subsidized Stafford Loan: $8,542.60 @ 6.55%; accrues $45.90 monthly interest; payment = $2.00*

*When enrolled in IBR, the government forgives any accrued interest on subsidized loans; thus, just making some minimum payments. 

9) Subsidized Stafford Loan: $2,656.41 @ 6.55%; accrues $14.40 monthly interest; payment = $1.00.

10) Unsubsidized Stafford Loan: $5,677.74 @ 5.35%; accrues $24.97 monthly interest; payment = $30.00

11) Unsubsidized Stafford Loan: $4,755.51 @ 6.55%; accrues $25.60 monthly interest; payment = $30.00

12) Unsubsidized Stafford Loan: $2,289.73 @ 6.55%; accrues $12.30 monthly interest; payment = $15.00.

TOTAL PAID = $1003.00.

personalfinance,[x-post from /r/studentloans] Fedloan Servicing - Automatic Payments Question,"I set up automatic payments on my federal student loans to get the .25% rate cut. At the time, I set it up so I would pay my old monthly payment without the rate cut so I would ""overpay"" by $50 a month or so and chip away at my loans faster. However, I'm not sure what's actually happening to that extra $50 a month.

When I go into my account, I see that my minimum payment is $154.95, and my scheduled payment is $206.11. But when I go into my payment history, it has the breakdown of the loan payments as if the minimum payment is $206.11. I figured this out by cross-referencing the actual payment made on each loan with the minimum payment in the loan details section.
So my question is, if my minimum payment is $154.95, but I'm automatically paying $206.11, where is the extra $50 going? Did they never actually give me the .25% rate cut, even though the minimum payment shown on Account Summary is lower than the previous minimum payment? As far as I can tell, an extra $50 is going to interest that I shouldn't be paying every month.

1. Based on my income it seems as though my IRA would be non-deductible. If I want to make sure I don’t get double taxed (i.e. post tax money being used to fund it and then getting taxed again when I withdraw funds upon retirement) **does it make sense to convert the IRA to a Roth immediately?** Let's assume my tax bracket at retirement will be higher than it is today. **I believe I'd take a very negligible tax hit if I convert it the same day I open and fund the account but can anyone confirm?**

2.I will want to save more than $5500 IRA limit for retirement this year, which means I will be putting some money in one of the aforementioned funds. Normally I would just choose a target retirement fund but the expense ratio seems very high.

I see that New York City has an income tax that is in addition to the New York State tax. He will be filing as single with no dependents.

personalfinance,Advice on next steps for repairing credit?,"Hello,

About 2 ½ years ago, I went through a bad depressive episode and stupidly ignored my credit card payments for months, for no particular reason. I am both no longer depressed and generally more responsible these days, and the main thing I am stressing about is that I have messed up my credit so badly while in my early 20s. For the last year or so, I have been trying to make more than the minimum payment each month, but I was unemployed for about 6 months, so my credit card was pretty much maxed out. 

I finally was able to pay off my card completely last week, which was a huge relief, but I'd like some advice on where to go from here. I am constantly worrying about being in a circumstance where my bad credit could do me in, such as having to find a new apartment, and want to fix it as much as possible, as quickly as possible. 

My only other debt is a small student loan, which has a pretty low interest rate, and I am on track with.

The FICO credit score I am able to see for free says my current credit score is 655, with a serious delinquency. I know this takes 7.5 years for this to go away. Which means another 4.5-5 years from now.

Okay questions:

What, if anything, can I do to improve my score and lessen the damage? I am currently concentrating on putting more money into savings, but would it help my credit score at all if I focused more on the student loan? I currently have automatic payments set up to pay the entire balance every month, I am planning on moving some of my other automatic payments (ie. Cell phone bill) to be paid by the credit card, will spending a larger amount and paying it off every month have more impact than doing the same with a smaller amount? Just how bad off am I right now?

Also, my mom is constantly terrifying me by telling me that potential jobs may reject me for my bad credit. Is this true, even if I am not applying for positions that have anything to do with managing money?

I wish I could go back in time and slap some sense into myself.

personalfinance,Best first credit card to get out of the following?,"21 yr old student trying to build credit. I don't need to finance anything in the near future. I spoke with my local credit union and they have the following 3 options for me. Which would be the best for building credit? I doubt my parents will want to cosign on anything, but it may be a possibility. Here is what my credit union told me. 

""So, (Credit Union Name) has three different cards. There is the **Secured Visa** card, where you would provide the funds that would be used as collateral. This card is best for building credit, you would put 110% of what your card limit would be on hold in your savings, and it would have an interest rate of 14.9%.
Then we have the **Classic Visa**, which is unsecured and doesn't need any funds on hold as collateral. This has a fixed interest rate of 11.9%, which is a great low rate! It also accrues reward points every time you use it.
Our best card to offer is our **Success Visa**, which is also unsecured, but has an even lower interest rate than our Classic card. It starts out at 2% for the first six months, and then only goes up to 7.5% variable. This card also earns cash back every time you use it! 
The ideal would be to get an unsecured card but the reason I listed the secured as the best card option is because it doesn't have as high requirements in terms of your beacon and credit score. If you had family who wouldn't mind signing with you on a card, you could also get an unsecured card that way, essentially utilizing their credit score to get yourself a lower interest rate/card with more incentives to it. The risk in that is that if there were any missed payments or if the card was maxed out it could negatively effect the co-signer, but since the card is being opened to build credit I don't foresee this as an actual risk.""",finance,1425495882

CERE is likely a message board pump and dump. They might have a public offering soon which will kill the stockprice. I do not think it will hold up it's trend. Expecting it to at MOST spike to .60 then fall back down, where I will go short risking off the high of the day. I honestly do not like stocks at this price, the r/r is always a lot more scary when there is a lot of potential percentage loss. Only shorting parabolic moves / adding into short on pops.

OREX I wish I got in on the dips today, I knew it had a really clear trend. Unfortunately I think it will gap down (so much emotion in one stock it's crazy). Expecting a washout to the lower 7's (7 - .25)! I honestly will only be shorting a pop on a washout BELOW 7, and will be risking 7. It is realllly a messy stock and to me honest, it isn't something I like to trade.

NVGN is most likely up on this: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-studies-confirm-ability-of-trxe-009-to-kill-brain-cancer-stem-cells-2015-03-04?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). I really hope this stock holds up and doesn't just washout right away tomorrow. Ideally it pops back over 3.5 and I could get a position in risking on the high of the day. Shorting into pops and parabolic moves.


IFON is clearly up on this: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/infosonics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2014-results-2015-03-04?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). Expecting it to parabolic in the morning to ideally the 3 - .15 mark, where it will hopefully get stuffed. In a odd case where it parabolics way past it, I will look to short a parabolic move to 3.3 - .55 range. Will be shorting parabolic moves, not shorting ""line in the sand""

I'm thinking about opening a new credit card to get cash back (current cards do not offer) and up my credit score. Probably something along the lines of a Chase Freedom (or other recommendations?) Hoping this would further reduce my utilization and increase my percentage of timely payments. 

Credit info: 

* Current score: ~710
* Current cards / limit: Wells Fargo Visa (5K). AMEX Delta Miles (no cash back) (15K)
* Utilization: &lt;10%
* Issues: 97% on time payments. (Fucked up 3 student loan payments when transitioning between grad-school and workforce. Loans for last year are timely. All cc payments have always been timely--carry no balance.)
* Inquiries / Collections: None.

Situation:

* 61k net income per year. 
* 18K in student loans (over 2 accounts, both federal). 
* No car loan or mortgage.

Long term goals:

* Buy a nicer used car. (1-2 years)

I live on California, United States of America. I am single, will be  23 years old when I start the job and have no dependents. I used a couple tools online to calculate my income after tax and it seems unreasonably high (It kept saying some amount around $70,000 is ""mine to take home). Is this correct? About 30% of my income goes to federal and state taxes? This seems really really high but I have never dealt with income tax on a real salary before (a lot of my jobs paid less than $6,000 for the entire work I did so I was  exempt from taxes).

personalfinance,Possibly refinancing our mortgage - is it worth it with these options?,"We are looking at moving within 5 years, but would like a little extra cash to either pay off other debt, or just keep putting into the equity of our house. Current mortgage is 5.375%, $120,056. 25 years left on a 30 year, $1006 a month. These are the options our lender gave us:

1.)3.7% ARM (5-1) 30 yr. $830/month.
2.) 3.99% fixed 25 yr. $915/month
3.) 4.05% fixed 30 yr. 851/month.

Heres the thing: after closing costs the mortgage would be at $126,400. So our total mortgage is going up an extra $6,400 (which includes closing costs, filling a new escrow account, other ""3rd party"" fees). Is it worth bumping up our mortgage an extra $6,400 if we are planning on moving within the next 5 years - when we may not even pay off that extra chunk before we move?

We aren't in need to lower our mortgage payment, so should we just sit where we are for the next few years in order to have a lower overall mortgage? This is how I'm leaning (sorry mortgage guy). Just wanted some more opinions.
Thanks!

Edit: The number is the total monthly payment, Interest plus Principle.

The ARM would be 33% principle. Fixed 25 year being 37% principle, and 30 year about be 30% principle.

I asked the lender this same question - his response:
""These are great questions. I did some work on my spreadsheets to find what your break-even point on your current program versus a 30 year fixed at 4.05 (as we discussed), so that we can compare a fixed rate program that we’re more inclined to do. So as we have it, if we look about 3 years into your current program on an amortization schedule, you will have about $112,500 remaining on principle. It would take just that amount of time for the principle balance on the new program to catch up (assuming same payments, even $100 extra a month adds only 6 months to that breakeven), and then it will at that point accumulate that much faster. Of course, this is faster on the ARM with the lower interest rate, though the point is that essentially your break-even is just 3 years into this loan. """,finance,1425509789

personalfinance,"$40,000 owed on 2013 RAV4 after poor decisions + $14,000 in credit card debt. Need advice.","I wasn't sure if I should post this here or in the subreddit for ADHD but, ultimately, the advice I seek is related directly to my financial situation. In a nutshell, after finally seeking help to overcome a lifetime of problems and not understanding why, I spoke to a professional yesterday and was diagnosed with adult ADHD (I'm 31 years old). I wanted to get to the root cause of my problems because I'm about to move and start a new career at $100k per year. I want to set myself up for success so I can overcome my failures I've repeated in the past. Which leads me to...

I purchased an FJ Cruiser Trail Team Edition, brand new, with all of the upgrades and an expensive lift kit along with tires and rims 2 years ago. I had gotten a new job that paid a whopping $53k a year and made a poor decision. Ultimately I was financing a vehicle that amounted to $690 or so a month (I believe a total financed amount of $49-52k). Needless to say, after about 8 months, I realized this was a very poor decision on my part. The cost of gas and the car payments made no sense at all. I decided to trade it in for a RAV4. Better gas mileage, I brought the length of the payments down from 8 years to 6 and the RAV4 has lower maintenance costs along with cheaper insurance.

Regardless, I owe $40,000 and it looks like it won't be paid off until March of 2021 at my current payments of $677 per month.

What are my options? Should I see if I can refinance that loan into a lower interest rate with a shorter term so I'm paying more each month at a lower rate but shortening my window of hell? Should I sell it, buy something used and pay off the debt / difference between the 40k and what I can get for the sale of the RAV4? I have no idea how to tackle this monstrosity. I'm finally in a place with my treatment (doctor, medication, books) for my ADHD to no longer make irresponsible financial decisions along with other decisions in my life. 

On top of the insanity above, I have about $14,000 in credit card debts that I owe. Should I work with a company to consolidate all of those into one payment with a lower interest rate (maybe find a place that will let me move several of my higher interest credit cards into a lower, single card) and pay down the lowest interest rate card(s) that remain?

These two items above are killing me. I'm making $100k a year and renting a home for $1,300 a month. I've learned to budget my expenses and stop eating out (which has allowed me to become quite the cook). I don't have any kids or a family. My credit score is favorable (600+) but not spectacular.

I've been wanting to seek advice for the longest time on here but was held back by my ADHD and the anxiety and depression it has created trying to succeed with it for my entire life (at least as far back as I can remember from grade school). Now that I'm working towards this new future, I need to address this very serious situation. I appreciate any advice anyone can provide. Thank you.",finance,1425513455
personalfinance,Confused about Federal Witholding,"Okay, so I'll preface this by saying that I'm not the most financially literate person; a lot of the terms on IRS sites and such fly right over my head. 

I started a new job a few months ago and after looking at my paycheck, my parents were telling me that they were withholding way too much from my paycheck. I have tried using the IRS calculator, but it doesn't tell me how much the federal withholding *should* be, but rather how much will be withheld by the end of the year.

Here is some info about me:

* In 2014 I made roughly $11k and had a 1.75k tax return
* I live in Texas
* I get paid weekly
* Weekly salary is $1180.58 (Annual salary of $61,390)
* Weekly Federal Withholding is $187.74, Social Security Tax is $71.56, Medicaid Tax is $16.74
* YTD for federal withholding for 2015 is $1710.25 so far
* I am single, live on my own, no home (I rent), no dependants

So, what is the best way to determine what my federal withholding ***should*** be? This way I could contact my companies payroll to change the withholding.

personalfinance,Credit Card Question / Advice,"Ok here's the deal...I have a low paying job (12.50/hr) where I am working 40 hours/week while I'm still in college.  I have about 2 years left of college.

I have $8000 in student loans subsidized - so they are not gaining any interest at this time.  I always have 2 years of federal pell grant that pays for most of my schooling - the loans I take out paid for a couple of key things I needed before I got this job.  I will probably not continue to take out any more loans.

Now, I had a credit card that I, like an idiot, completely abused.  I had a year of great credit with them/always on time etc...and then went through some troubles and racked up a $1900 credit with them.  After missing almost a year of payments they closed my account and sent it to collections.  That was in 2013.  I still have 2 years of school and do not plan on buying a home or financing a car or anything for quite awhile.  Pretty much nothing but cash at this point.

I was wondering if it would be beneficial to responsibly open a secured credit card through my bank and helping to at least rebuild my credit (using it for gas only etc and paying it each month) - this should establish at least SOME good credit right?

Now back to the original question...what is the best thing I should do about the $1900?  At this point the damage is done right?  Should I just ignore it and let it fall off my credit report in another 5 years?  Or what is your advice?  I have since learned the value of money and have started using YNAB to better watch my finances and I really just started turning things around.  I have about $1500 in a TSP that can be tapped but I would like to roll it into my 401k but if it's more beneficial to do something about that collections account I'd love some info.

personalfinance,Learn From My Mistake: Check Your ACTUAL Credit Report Before Making Major Purchases,"Went to go get pre-approved for our first home loan. I knew my credit score was around 760 since we purchased a car 8 months prior with financing through our credit union. I monitor my credit with Credit Karma, so I was pretty comfortable with planning our home budget based on an interest rate that correlates with that score since it all matched pretty closely.

Lo-and behold, the mortgage lender ran my report and it showed a  COLLECTIONS notice from 2012 from Comcast over $14.70 on two of the three credit reporting agencies. That dropped my score on my two reports to 630 and 670! One agency was never notified, so my score was 757 on that one. Since they take the middle score, our quoted interest rate was 4.313% instead of the 3.82% we were anticipating. Needless to say, that's thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.

Apparently when the credit union ran my credit for the car, they just run credit on one agency instead of three. So it was never revealed. Comcast never contacted me, nor had any collections agency about the $14.70. We cancelled our account when we moved, were told our account would be credited and we were good to go. Apparently, the credit they applied was short by $14.70. Don't know why we were never notified. 

The credit union was baffled, as I have no history of late payments, long established history and no credit card debt. Only debt is student loans which are through the Dept. of Ed and have always been paid on time.

Credit Karma just now posted the collections report, even though its apparently been on there since May of 2014. Paid Comcast what they are due. Now trying to get it expunged from my report, but have been put in the call waiting limbo for the past two days. 

Supposedly it will take 45 to 90 days for the credit agency to change the report to reflect the collections being removed. However, no one seems to know what my score will be after fixing it, as it may not just jump up 70 points right away.So hitting my credit again could jeopardize us getting a loan if my credit score is is lower. Waiting 6 months for it to recover is no sure thing as mortgage rates are likely to climb, so we'd wind up getting the same interest rate even with a better score.

So, yeah. Don't wind up like me. Check your ACTUAL CREDIT REPORT before making major purchases.

**The Plan:** 
 
1. First try to consolidate all the private loans through https://custudentloans-refinance.lendkey.com/ to hopefully get a lower interest. Re-evaluate if this goes through. If not, we will pay the minimum monthly payments on everything except the highest interest rate loan, so the order they are listed.  
2. Try to beg and plead to extend the terms/lower the monthly payments on all loans. See if we can put them into forbearance or deferment while funnelling all cash to the highest interest loan.  
3. Pay of the loans!
  

**The Questions:**    

1. Is there any way for us to get access to our Canadian Pension Plan funds and channel them towards loans? Is this a bad idea even if it is possible?  
2. Is there any compelling reason we shouldn’t throw our 20k of savings right at the loans?
3. Is our payment plan sound? I’ve read Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey and while I think the snowball technique is a good method for positive reinforcement, wouldn’t paying the lowest loans off first actually end up costing us more money in the longterm due to the higher interest rates on the larger ones?
4. Are there any tax breaks that we can take advantage of in regards to student loan repayment? Will they even matter if we are not Canadian citizens or actively living in the US?
5. Where can we find more information about financial planning for Americans living abroad?

I think I should file an amended tax return for 2013, and I'd like to run the idea past this sub, since many of you know much better than I do when it comes to taxes and the like.

When I did my taxes last year, I put the information in from my 1098-T because I was claiming education credits. This wound up working against me, and I even went from being owed a refund by the state to owing the state money. My scholarships and grants increased my AGI, but I've since come to understand that PELL and TAP (NY state aid) isn't taxable income. 

What I'd like to do is file an amended return without the information from the 1098-T, forgoing the education credits, and taking the difference in federal and state returns I would have had were it not for the inflated AGI.

My hesitation comes from something a professor said to me in the business school where I had my taxes done this year. This professor, who supervises the students participating in the VITA program, told me that filing an amended return to get more money back may increase my chances of being audited.  The more I think about it, the less reasonable this seems, but she put the fear of the IRS into me.

* What should I prioritize or maximize first? Obviously I should beef up my emergency fund and Roth IRA. But should I do emergency fund FIRST, to minimal or even total exclusion of the other stuff, and then once I reach 4 months salary, then back off and start contributing to the Roth? Or do both simultaneously? 

* Is it silly of me to overpay my loans when I could use the extra cash to build up the EF or the Roth? Or should I concentrate 100% on wiping out the loans ASAP with even higher overpayments; thereby putting Roth or EF contributions on hold until I do so? BTW, the interest rate is around 6% I think. 

* And what about my HSA? I already reached the threshold where I think the bank will allow it to be invested. Am I being foolish or smart to not do so? I'm in pretty good health so I don't usually go to the doctor often if at all, maybe once a year. But you never know... I know I'm not maximizing the HSA contributions at all. Should HSA be a priority over the EF or Roth or loans?

personalfinance,529 for Myself to be used in August?,"I am starting a post-masters degree in August. The total cost is $12,000. I will be paying cash. I am considering putting all 12k in a conservative (mostly bonds) 529 investment for myself to get a state tax deduction. My state tax is 4.75% and I can deduct $2,500/year on my taxes and the amount contributed in one year can be carried forward for up to 10 years. This would equal about $100 off my state taxes each year for five years ($500 total). I could claim this deduction for 5 years and we do itemize and anticipate continuing to itemize.

Is there any reason that I shouldn't do this?

Update: Okay, so I've learned that I can get a tax credit for 20% of up to 10k spent on higher education. This would be a $2000 tax credit on my 2015 tax return. However, any money used toward a tax credit or deduction cannot be claimed as a qualified higher education expense (no double dipping). So, basically I can either get the state tax deduction which amounts to $100/year for 5 years or I can get a federal lifelong learning credit of $2000 on my 2015 return and not risk the market volatility of a short term investment in a 529. **TL;DR: I will not start a 529, but will take the lifelong learning credit of $2,000.**",finance,1425557671

Looking at my paystubs, only OASDI, Federal withholding and Medicare are being taken out. No state tax is being taken out. 

Tl dr; Title.

I emailed the payroll department detailing  the problem along with screencaps as evidence. Ive also let my boss and his boss know what the situation is and they said theyre behind me.

As far as I can tell this is no fault of my own. Every job Ive had state tax and social security taxes are non negotiable but I know some states (coincidentally the state where my company's HQ is) don't have state tax.

As for actually paying, I can do it but it'll  be tough. I'm that typical millenial; no savings, student debt etc. Is there a chance the company would assist in paying this tax owed? Im not looking for a payday or to sue the company. I just want this situation resolved and my taxes taken out moving forward.

P.S.

Another thing I noticed. Last tax season I owed a couple  hundred dollars to the state. I thought it was because of my exemptions on my state tax form and asked to change it. 

Payroll sent me a new form and I filled it out. I gave myself an exemption where I should not have because I have no dependents, therefore uncle sam taking the most out of my checks is ok.

I scanned and emailed the form back to payroll. This was in 2014. Looking at my exemptions/payroll info in 2015, it never changed. It appears that no one even filed the paperwork, unless they saw what I was doing and just didnt file  the paperwork to save me from myself.

personalfinance,A cautionary tale - be careful who you trust.,"This is the story about how my parents lost a $500,000 inheritance through no fault of their own.

My grandmother (RIP) had a boyfriend of over 20 years. They'd have been married but for the impact on social security and all that. My grandmother died in 2010, and her boyfriend lived on. For the last 4 years my parents took care of him as blood after Grandma died. They shuttled him to the VA for all his appointments, cooked for him, did anything that was needed. In 2012 his health deteriorated and he went into the hospital and it looked grim. The tough SOB gutted it out and pulled through. At that time it was determined that he could no longer live alone in rural Douglas County, so my parents spend a good sum of money and turned part of their basement into an apartment for him. He thrived and his health improved.

He had been a bachelor and had no children, only distant cousins and nephews who ignored him and did nothing to aid. He told my parents numerous times that he was so blessed to have them to take care of him. For the last 2 years he lived in their home, rent free, and they fed him, provided for him. All along he made it known that his entire estate would be theirs, including several valuable antique autos and tons of other assets.

Sadly in August of last year, he passed away in my mothers arms after having a stroke. My parents were executors and sole heirs to his estate. They entrusted the small town attorney that had drafted his will to handle the probate. Over the ensuing months my family and parents (who are in their 70s themselves) have worked hundreds of hours to clean and organize his home as he was a hoarder. We hauled off over 20 tons of trash from the home, tirelessly combing the contents for anything of value to put in an auction. We didn't get to the numerous outbuildings before winter, which are chock full of antique autos and parts.

Early estimates from trusted experts and auctioneer placed the conservative value at $400-500k at auction, which was to be held this spring.

Over the past 6 months my parents have contact the attorney numerous times and were assured everything was being handled. They took a month long vacation to Florida in February to get some relaxation time before my wife and I's second child arrives tomorrow.

They hadn't heard from the attorney all month long, and the estimated 6 months of probate was up. Finally after not getting any kind of response again, my mother became concerned. She contacted the county clerk and inquired as to when the date was set for the execution of the probate and was told nothing had been filed.

For 6 months the attorney assured my trusting parents that it was being handled. She strung them along, ultimately lying to them on Wednesday about being in court all day and unavailable. My parents drove to the small town on a whim and stopped at her office. No answer to the knocking. They left and drove around the block, and the attorney came out to leave. My parents confronted her and she confessed that in 6 months she had neglected to file the will with the county. Something that takes a matter of a few hours work. There is a 6 month limit to do so after death. The will is invalid, and the estate will revert to the same distant heirs which ignored this man his entire 90 years of life.

A second attorney consulted yesterday believes my parents can get reimbursed by the estate for any expenses they incurred while acting in good faith as executors. They have paid out thousands in utility bills and maintenance on the property, in cleaning it up for sale, in travel expenses.

The attorney is a one-person office. No malpractice insurance. Probably not a dime to their name.

So the moral of the story is, don't just TRUST that someone is acting professionally on your behalf. Demand to see hard proof that action is being taken and that you are being served by those you are paying to act on your behalf. My parents appear to have ZERO recourse for what was done to them.

My stomach is in knots. I feel badly for my parents. They have pensions and live comfortably, but this could have provided them with added security. They had also indicated of course that my sister and I would receive a substantial amount of this as inheritance, which was going to essentially pay for my childrens education. Now, that is not going to happen.

TL;DR. **** attorneys. My poor parents. FML.",finance,1425568459

personalfinance,Stuck deciding on how to proceed with private student loans - default and consolidation,"Knowing I'm going to take a brow beating for my choices, as seems to be par for the course, I'm putting out a disclaimer stating I know I haven't made the best financial choices.  This isn't about that.  This is about doing the right thing and looking to get some input.

Right now, I have two private student loans due.  One totally nearly 20k, the other at nearly 38k.  Both are already on the lowest payment plan, and neither are eligible for IBR.  My federal student loans already are on IBR and due to my income, I'm currently not required to pay anything on them.  My parents each cosigned one loan.

I have contacted my servicer multiple times, and they will not budge.  The most I can afford to pay on my current budget is $50 a month for each loan, totally $100.  I have recently worked to clear up extra space in my budget, but everyone here should obviously know that money doesn't just appear.

My current take home gross pay is just over $1800 a month, most of which is already spoken for due to groceries, rent, bills, gas, etc.

I tried applying for consolidation through four separate banks/companies, and was denied each time.  I am trying to do this without a cosigner, as my parents are currently on the hook for my student loans.

Here's my problem.  My student loans want $140 and $350 a month, neither of which I can really afford without hurting myself in other areas (becoming late on bills, sacrificing my health to eat less than my current quantity of food.)  One loan is about a week and a half away from defaulting, while the other just came out of forbearance.  Neither loan has any forbearance left.

I know if I default, it will hit both mine and my parents credit pretty hard, although admittedly both of our credit scores and pretty much trash (mine in the mid 500s, not sure about my parents.  However, they had discussed filing for bankruptcy a few years back and still are considering it as an option.)

**EDIT:** As suggested by /u/financierss, I'm adding some extra info here.

-It took me 8 years of going to school on and off to graduate, which is part of why I'm in the mess I am.  Up until August of 2014, I didn't have a job paying me much more than minimum wage.  Graduated May 2014.

-I work an entry level IT job, and recently had to take a company wide pay cut.  This put me down to below 34k in my salary, however, my benefits are pretty great in that I get solid medical coverage all the way around.

-My budget is pretty slimmed down, as I just recently overhauled it to cut out most of the unnecessary spending.  The one thing I will not budge on is the $80 a month I set aside for my fiance and I to go out and enjoy ourselves.  I've worked hard lately to make sure I free up as much money as I can, but even though I've overhauled my budget, I can't make the money just appear.  It will take time of executing the budget to gain the free cash

-I currently put $0 a month into savings, as I just don't have that much free cash (or else paying my student loans wouldn't be a problem

-I currently do NOT pay on my car lease or car insurance, as per a deal with my parents.  That lease will be up in November, however, and I will need to take over that payment once that happens.  I estimate this will be at least $200 a month between the car and insurance.

-My degree was not in the field I currently work in, and I'm ok with that. While I may not always enjoy IT work, I recognize there is money in it as time goes on.


I'm coming to you, PFers, to help me sort out how I can get out of this hole.

TL;DR - Private student loan company want more money per month than I can possibly afford right now on two student loans totaling nearly $60k.  They refuse to work with me on lowering payments.  Four different banks/companies denied for me loan consolidation.  One student loan defaults in a week and a half, and parents are cosigners.  Not sure where to go from here.",finance,1425571214

personalfinance,Need advice on 70K student loan debt,"Hey guys, this is my first time posting but I am a long time fan of r/personalfinance. I have read a lot of posts about student loans, but I am wondering if you guys could give me a fresh set of eyes on my situation.

Age: 26, male

City: St. Louis, MO

Income: 50,000/year

Marital status: Single

Student loan debt: 72,000



I currently work as 1st year staff in a Big 4 accounting firm. I have my undergrad and master's degrees in accounting as well as my CPA license. That being said, I have tried to analyze and model my situation quite a few times to come up with an ""attack plan"" for my debt. However, I worry that maybe I'm not approaching the situation objectively and I'm making unrealistic assumptions about monthly cash flow available for paying down debt.



Let me give a rundown of my income and expenses, plus what I THINK I will be able to pay towards my student loans.

Income and Expenses:

monthly post-tax income - ~$2,600 (inclusive of health insurance premiums, Roth 401(k) contributions, and monthly parking fees)

monthly rent - $725 (inclusive of all utilities)

monthly Gas - $120-150

monthly groceries - $400-500 (I think I need to budget this better)

Monthly internet - $40

Gym membership - $20/month

car insurance - $70/month

No car loan

no credit card debt

No cellphone bill



That puts me right at 1,000 discretionary income each month. In a perfect world, that 1,000 would go directly to student loans, but realistically I think I can put 800 towards them. The difference would be to cover things like oil changes, haircuts, etc.



Big 4 accounting has pretty good salary progression, and I think it is reasonable to assume 65K in two years, 85K after 5 years. So as much salary goes up, hopefully I can pay more. This may too be optimistic as I will likely get married and have children sometime in that time span.

Loans

Federal loans - $50,000 @ 5.3% avg.

Nelnet Private - $15,000 @ 8%

Discover Private - $7,000 @ 8.5%



I have applied for a monthly payment reduction on my federal loans so that I can apply the bulk of my 800 a month payments to the discover loan first and then the Nelnet loan. Once those are paid off, my plan is to make the full 800 a month to the federal loans, but apply as much as possible to the higher interest rate loans. 



When I model all of that in excel, it has me getting out of debt completely in around 8-9 years (not accounting for pay increases and the ability to make larger payments though)



Questions for you guys:

1.) do any of my expenses seem out of line? is $725 too much for rent in St. Louis? What is a reasonable grocery budget?

2.) is 8-9 years overly optimistic?

3.) does my current plan completely alienate the possibility of taking vacations/buying a car during my debt repayment?

4.) Do you have any other advice for me or tips for tweeking my current plan to make it more manageable?

I know you guys see a ton of student loan threads, so thank you SO much for taking the time to read and respond to another one :)",finance,1425571816

personalfinance,"Help with broke, mentally-ill brother","As of yesterday, my brother(38) has been placed on a minimum 48 hour psych hold. This could be extended an additional 5 days, and possibly up to 6 months. 

What started as depression has spiraled into something much worse. I am now faced with the prospect that it will be a long time before he will be able to hold down a steady job, if ever.

His financial situation is as follows:

For the past two years has been supported exclusively by my retired mother. In that time he has borrowed what is close to $200,000 out of her retirement account. This was stupid of her but there is no turning back. This money payed for his last few years of college (undergrad) including an excessive amount of living expenses.

He dropped out of school midway through his last semester under the advice of his psychologist. That was in the fall. He attempted to return this spring, but again dropped out. He had planned to attempt yet again in the summer. As of this moment, in his current state, he has said he will not to go college ever again. (He is 18 credits short of a degree in Finance). 

I say all this to explain that he is out of his mind. He is also completely broke, but he does have some assets:

~$40,000 car

~$150,000 house with $100,000 equity

~$8,000 motorcycle

~18,000 truck (loan of 15,000 tied to this)

~5,000 watch

And his debts are appoximately $200,000 to my mother. His stated intention is to sell all of his assets to pay off all of his debts (mortgate + debt to mother) as best he can. If he does this, it will leave him with no car or house, no job, and still owe my mother ~$45,000 (if he drops out of school, I believe she will never see this money). He then plans to get a ""shitty redneck job and get drunk every night and pay her off with as much as I have left over."" Again, he is not in his right mind.

More background. From 2008-2012/13 my brother was self-employed. He ran what I can only call a business in the gray area of the law. He ran a poker room in state that the status of poker vs other forms of gambling was in limbo. The status was firmed up that it was illegal and he was put out of business. In that time, he made anywhere from 90,000 to 250,000/year.  He paid self-employment taxes on that. Prior to that he was an on again off again waiter and construction worker (waiter was legit, construction was under the table). So, with the above money, he purchased the above assets. He had about $60,000 cash when his business was shut down. The shitty part was he had $120,000 cash, but put paid cash for a $60,000 car that is now worth $40,000 due to age, mileage, and a wreck. 

My brother is also severly obese. He has ankle, knee, back, and heart problems due to his weight. I do not think he can physically wait tables anymore nor do a ""shitty redneck job.""

So, onto my questions.

-What government assistance might he qualify for? I want to help my mother stop hemorrhaging money on him. Are food stamps an option? 

-Due to his physical and mental health, could he be declared disabled and receive any form of SSI benefits despite his spotty legitimate employment/tax history?

-He currently has healthcare through the federal ACA marketplace. I believe he should qualify for medicaid due to his income status. He has no income. My mother pays his bills. This would remove his healthcare bill, yes?

He is single, no children. Besides food stamps and medicaid, and considering his spotty tax/employment history, what other assistance might be out there for someone in his condition and no income. 

For the record, I want to help and be supportive, but I'm also keeping this situation at a distance. I do not and will not give him money, sign loans, or sign any paperwork putting me in charge of anything concerning him. He will also not be allowed to live with me if he were to become homeless. My wife and I have each been through situations like this with both of our parents (my father, her mother and father). 






On the flipside for complete context: Wife(32) and I(32) bring home $175k annually. We have 2 children under 4. We max our IRAs, put 10% into 401ks (increasing 1% per year), contribute to college savings accounts,  save approximately $1000/month, have a $35,000 emergency fund, own a home (35% paid off), and on an on. We could eat out a little less and save a little more in our 401ks, but aside from that we are pretty financially responsible and well off. Net worth (all assets minus all liabilities) is $600,000. We just have screwed up extended families.",finance,1425574916

personalfinance,Building Credit History,"Hello PF,

Long time subscriber and big fan of you all.

I'm in my Mid-20's, have a decent salary, and have been building savings the past 3 years. I started a new job two years ago, and about the same time I also switched to a credit union from a bank and got a credit card.

APR was high ~18.5%, but I expected that as I really had no credit history. My limit was fairly decent (3,000) due to my salary and policy of the credit union.

This week (2 Years Later), I am now at the 760 credit score mark, and went in to inquire about getting a higher credit limit and lower interest rate. I'm also looking forward to getting a new car or Condo in the 2-3 year time frame.

My visit to the Credit Union was interesting. I spoke with a CSR, and he asked me the general questions about job, rent, etc.
He queried his computer, and then said that with my great credit score, he they could probably offer APR of around 8.5%. He then called the credit office to finalize, but they apparently took a closer look at my account and caught that I am still a new borrower.

According to the CSR, there is a 3-year probationary period for new borrowers before they can change the initial credit information. I also asked if this would affect getting a car loan in my 2-3 year time frame, and he said that I should probably try to expand my credit history by getting 2-3 additional credit cards. He also sounded dubious about my time frame for a loan...
----------------------------------------------------------------

Questions -
Is this a normal credit card policy?

With my history and score, what should I expect for interest rates &amp; credit limits from other credit card issuers?

What are some further actions I should take with my eye on a Car Loan in a few years? Is there anything else I can do other than continuing to charge to my card and getting more cards?

Part B which states my portion of the merger should be treated for US fed taxes as a dividend.

Or in lieu of Part A, I certify that I was not a shareholder of Covidien before the merger and hadn't purchased any shares.

personalfinance,"CC debt, student loans, and emergency savings fund - am I tackling this in the best way?","First off, thank you everyone for the great knowledge in this thread. I haven't been the best about my finances and don't really have many people in my life to ask financial related questions to, so I am very grateful to have found r/personalfinance. 

A little about me: 25 and (now) make $55k - recent promotion from $47.5k

 $8k student loans (originally $15k), $7k CC debt, and about to have $2k in savings.

I have 3 goals set up in mint - one to pay off my Amex, one to pay off my Visa, and one to have a $6k emergency fund (what the $2k I currently have is geared for). I was able to get ahead on my student loan payments so I pay about $150/month on those just to pay the minimum. I'm setting aside a minimum of $1k a month  (at time I pay a bit more to my credit cards) to tackle my debt and have started distributing this in the following manner:

$250: Visa (~+5k balance)
$250: Amex (~$2.5k balance, higher interest rate than Visa)
$250: Savings account #1
$250: Savings account #2

I guess my biggest question is, should I be setting that much aside for the emergency fund or taking one of the $250 emergency fund payments and using that towards my credit cards? Not sure which should really be the first priority.",finance,1425580754

personalfinance,Help me attack my $100k of debt in 5 years,"So I’m stealing this format from another poster because it’s easy to read.  Broken into sections:


1.	My Financial Background
2.	My PRIVATE (key point here) Student Loans in detail
3.	My Strategy/Questions
4.	Conclusion

________________________________________
•	**My Financial Background**


I’m an officer in the military. Quite a few benefits to this of course, a good one being that all of my loans are capped at a max of 6% interest. Also health/dental/vision is free.  Recently received $25,000 of life insurance, paid off all credit card/uniform debt with it (about 5k spent) total.


*Profile*

**Age/Sex:** 22 year old male

**Marital Status:** Single

**Monthly income:** $2900 + $1200 of allowances (BAH).  So right around $50k/year

**Credit Card:** Zero debt

**Car:** Paid off and running great, should last at least 30k more miles if not more.

**Health/Dental:** Free health/dental/vision

**Housing:** Rent is about $550/month.

**Current Savings:**  About $22,000, so I am pretty set on emergency funds.

**Retirement:**  Invest 10% of my paycheck (allowances not included) every month into a Roth TSP ($290)

**Credit History:** Been establishing since I was 16. Have a decently high score last time I checked, like 745


**Promotions/pay raises:** Guaranteed for us the first few years. In January 2017 I will be making about $65k, and in January 2019 I will be making around $87k+ depending on my location. My service contract is essentially 10 years, so no worries about job security or switching careers. 

________________________________________

•	**My Loans (15 year repayment, all fixed rate)**

•	Private Student Loan 1 – $34,600 @ 6% = Min of $293/month

•	Private Student Loan 2 – $25,300 @ 5.75% = Min of $211/month

•	Private Student Loan 3 - $24,100 @ 6% = Min of $204/month

•	Private Student Loan 4 - $14,500 @ 4.25% = Min of $109/month

•	Private Student Loan 5 - $4,600 @ 6% = Min of $50/month

•	Total $103,000 with minimum of $868/month

Yes I paid too much for my education, that’s beside the point now.  Private schools suck up a lot of money, but let’s talk more about how I can fix it.

I also have a Stafford (federal loan) of $22,000 at 3%.  I don’t really care about this one because the debt will be forgiven after 10 years as I am public service.  I will make minimum payments ($110) on this until that forgiveness.

________________________________________
**My Strategy/Questions:**

1.	Strategy: Essentially once you take all of my minimum payments out (including the Stafford), I drop $980/month on loans.  I spend about $300/month on food, I rarely eat out and make my own food (because I’m into fitness). Gas around $75 on average. Rent the aforementioned $550.  TSP takes $290. This leaves me with roughly $2150 of discretionary income a month. **My plan is to drop an extra $1000/month above the minimum payments and knock out the 6% interest loans first, then hit the two lower ones.  Without even accounting for increases in my pay, this should get rid of this debt in about 5.5 years.**


2.	REFINANCING? So the bank which gave me these private student loans will not consolidate or refinance them for me without a cosigner, which I do not have.  Loan refinancing companies such as So-Fi or Citizen’s bank will.  Basically refinancing/consolidating through So-Fi or Citizen’s bank would save me approximately $150/month by turning the plan into a 20 year repayment at 6% which I could then add into my aggressive strategy. I would leave the 5.75% and 4.25% loan with my current bank, and then refinance the remaining $64,000 into the same interest rate, with a longer repayment period. The key here is I’m planning to pay off this 100k debt aggressively in about 5 years. Is there any negative to refinancing that $64,000 into a longer repayment term and then including that extra $150 into my avalanche? They have no origination fee at So-Fi. And I’m talking fixed rate on this refinance, variable is available (like 3.5% starting) but I feel that’s a bit risky isn’t it?


3.	Advice on what to do with the $20k I have in my bank now?  I don’t really NEED anything and don’t spend frivolously, so I was planning on just sitting on it for now in case a major need arises (like my car breaks down, etc.). I do love the financial security I feel toward attacking my loans now that I have that money though for emergency needs.   


_______________________
**Conclusion**

Basically, need an evaluation of my strategy and someone to enlighten me of the positives and negatives of refinancing in my situation. All the info I've found is on people wanting to refinance their federal loans, not someone like me who has quite a bit of private student loan debt. My goal is to knock this 100k out in 5 years like I mentioned above.

personalfinance,Unsure about this mortgage refinance,"We have a 5% mortgage with 225k remaining and I'm trying to refinance. Our house value is probably above 300k now so we would easily still have over 20% equity on a new loan.  

We got an offer for 4%/4.080 APR or 3.875/4.007 APR (with 1k down) which will reduce our payments by ~280/month. The new loan amount would be 234K to cover closing costs and escrow for property tax and insurance. I guess I was kind of surprised at the 9k figure above our existing loan amount. With our excellent credit I thought we could get something a bit more enticing as far as interest rate, but the officer said it is trending up. Worst case, we still save money with this, but can I do a lot better?

Also, is there a way to approach lenders without having to fork over all your personal info? It would be nice to just talk some numbers and then go to an application if you actually like what you see.",finance,1425582302

A bit about me, I am 23, just recently got a promotion at work giving me an annual salary of $52,000 plus bonuses. 

I live at home (though I am currently looking at moving out), I have a car loan, and student loans.

My student loans are through the devil...(Sallie Mae) 
and aren't technically student loans. My school wasn't accredited when I applied for my loans so they are ""Career Training Loans"" everything I have tried in terms of re financing them, consolidating, etc has been a dead end because they aren't ""student loans"" and I cant even write off the interest I pay on them.

with my promotion, each check auto deposits and goes into 3 accounts 

1 account gets $500 per check ($1000 a month) and that account auto pays all of my bills, nothing else.

the second account gets $220 a check ($440 a month) and that is my gas money, iTunes, eating drinking, hobby money.

the rest of each check $615.88 ($1231.76 a month) goes into savings and isn't touched. 

I am lucky enough that living at home, my parents cover my car insurance and cell phone. (family plans and group discounts on insurance.)

here is my thought. I did some math using loan repayment calculators and come up with this

waiting until this July at which point I will have just over $10,000 in savings as a safety net. I will keep paying all of my loans as normal but I will shift my $1,231.76 that was originally going into saving to go towards my loan with the highest interest. So I would then be paying ($1,231.76 + minimum of $350.15( so $1,581.91 a month.)
That loan will be paid off in 14 payments (sept '16)

 my next highest interest rate is the smallest loan which at that time will be at $1,687. Take the $1,581.91 plus this loans minimum payment of $50 (1,631.91 total) pull a bit from my fun account, ($55.09) and pay that loan off in 1 month. (Oct '16)

my third (and last loan) is now at $24,3xx.xx.
I would then take the $1,631.91 that I have been rolling and add the last loans minimum of $319.92 a month for a monthly payment of $1,951.83 and have it paid off by December of '17 (14 payments)

so my thought is to not move out (my GF might not be to thrilled after we have talked so much about it) and stay at home and follow that plan. I feel like I would fall ""behind"" and still be living at home when I'm 25-26. but that isn't un common. and I will be miles ahead once I move out at that age with no student loan debt, an additional $720 a month in my budget, and $10,000 in savings. I could pay my car off quite a bit quicker as well even after I move out with that much extra cash. 

I did not factor in bonuses, or my annual raise (anywhere from 1%-4%)

all my math was after all of my medical, dental, 401k etc have been deducted. 

my parents are okay with me staying not charging me anything while I live there, as long as I am not burning money. 

does this sound like a bad idea? good idea? am I missing something I could I be doing also, or instead of? I appreciate any advice. 

Thank you so much for reading all this...

personalfinance,What if someone doesn't trust putting money into a 401k?,"Someone I was talking to made up a good point about 401ks vs pensions. Their main argument against the former is that they're convoluted, it's easy to Lose money if you don't exercise your right to sell or trade stocks, shitty fees, and it also feeds money into an unstable system that essentially means your retirement could be dependent on the success of certain companies, even ones you don't like.


I had a nice pension set up from the government but ended up working in the private sector (tech industry) and kinda want to get back to government work because they take care of their own.


I myself am not too knowledgable about 401ks but I don't like the idea of contributing to one because of the reasons stated by my friend who shed some light on some things.

I called my current mortgage company and asked them about refinancing to take advantage of the mortgage insurance rate.  They gave me a higher rate than what I have now.

Should i consider refinancing to take advantage of the lower rate?  If so, how should I go about finding a lending company?

I finished grad school in a worthless liberal arts degree and lost two of the three jobs I had.  Grace period is over and the first payment is looming.

Part of me just wants to ignore it and hope it will go away, but I know Uncle Sam would never allow it....So I'm looking for advice on creative and aggressive methods of paying back my loan(s) ASAP.  I can't stand the thought that on a long term repayment plan, I could still be paying for my education while my kids are in college.

The good news is, I live as excessively frugal as I can and have been doing so for years.  Even though I only make about 15k/yr I've been able to save up about 40k during college.  

I owe about 50k total.  I've got 20k in stocks &amp; index funds and 15k in money market. 5k in checking. My gut plan is to take the 15k and send it straight to Great Lakes.  

However, the problem is, unless I pay a massive amount now from savings/stocks, I literally have NO income to make payments on a monthly basis - but at 6% interest paying 15k now takes over 8 years off the loan.  

I've been messing around with mechanical turk and doing everything I can to get gigs for the summer (artist.)  Does anyone have creative money ideas - like putting the 15k in investments and using profits to pay the loan on a monthly basis.

personalfinance,Did I calculate my tax withholding correctly..?,"Hi everyone


I just moved from Hong Kong to Los Angeles a few weeks ago. In Hong Kong, things were fairly simple for me. Income received was pre-tax, and you pay your tax bill all in one go at the end of the fiscal year. Here in LA, I'm having a hard time doing up my budget. 

Am I missing something or will maxing out my 401k instead of saving the equivalent amount in cold hard cash actually **increase** the money I have left over for discretionary spending?

personalfinance,"Moving to the U.S for an MBA, pay for it out of pocket or take a loan?","So as the title suggests, I've applied to a pretty competitive MBA program (top 15) in the U.S and I've been interviewed as well. This means I'm one step closer to being accepted which is why I've started thinking about my finances. I am an international student (originally from India) and quite fortunately, my parents have generously offered to fund my education (I'm 23 so on the younger side for an MBA). We've budgeted about $200k for two years and that includes tuition, living expenses, travelling back and forth and basically everything else. Now my question is, I know they can afford to pay for everything but would it be advisable to take a loan (with or without a US co-signer) for a part of it for tax purposes? 



I say this because I will be in the US on a student visa but once I get an internship, I will be able to get a social security number. I'd expect to get a salary anywhere between $22-29k during my internship. I also plan to work for a minimum of 2 years post MBA in the US. The 1st year compensation I could expect at my target companies would be around $120k + $15k signing bonus + $15k year end = $150k. The second year would be similar minus the signing bonus. I would be paying a significant amount in taxes, so I guess my question is, would taking out a loan help in anyway? What can I do to make sure I'm spending all this money efficiently? Also in case this helps: this is what the interest rates offered by one particular firm look like - 



Interest rate: 6-10%, depending on individual profiles, with a representative APR of 8.51%. Rates are variable from 5.5-8.5% over a base rate of 3-month US Libor.



Thanks for all the help. I've always been a bit sheltered wrt my finances but I'm trying to be more proactive now that I'm going to be living independently. In case I've made any stupid/naive assumptions, feel free to correct me.",finance,1425644918
personalfinance,Buying vehicle outright versus financing - specific situation,"I've been in the market for a new vehicle for a couple of weeks.  I shopped around for financing for a few days and found a credit union near me that advertised for rates on almost any vehicle and almost any loan amount for 2% for 48/63 months at my credit score range.  I applied  for a loan on Monday for the absolute maximum I would finance ($25k), expecting to hear a response within a day or 2.  

Since then, I purchased a 2008 Toyota 4runner from Carmax all in for about $18k (includes tax/title/reg and a 3 year warranty through Carmax).  I put $4k down toward that, so I would be financing ~$14k.  They offered me an interest rate of 5.4% for 48 months, and let me drive off the lot Tuesday night with a 3 day window to come back with alternate financing for no extra charges/fees. 

As of Thursday yesterday, 3 days later, I had not heard back from the credit union regarding a decision on my loan application.  I called them and the associate told me the loan department had had some questions that needed clarifying before making a decision.  I updated her with the details of my specific purchase and she said she would inform the loan officer.  From what I gathered, however, the numbers that had been thrown around on their end were nowhere close to that 2% number.  My monthly payment with carmax is about $330 for the 5.4% and 48 months, and the credit union associate was saying they were in the same ballpark range, maybe a few dollars cheaper.  I'm not sure why I wouldn't qualify for the lowest rate since my credit score was about 780 through transunion, but I guess since I'm young and still don't have a ton of other or longer credit lines that hurts me.

My question for PF is this:  if I don't get a significantly better financing offer through the credit union, should I stick with the carmax financing @ 5.4% or just go ahead and pay off the balance with cash?  I have enough money saved up to pay the rest of the $14k cash without having to withdraw from my emergency fund or killing my savings.  I was planning on investing that $14k difference in general stocks, so I would expect a decent return, but I've read that any loan over 4% should be paid off fully if possible.  If I did pay the loan off, I would still invest the same amount I had earmarked for a car loan each month in stocks.  I have to make this decision by tonight to get within the 3 day window for Carmax.

  We both fund our Roth IRA accounts every year, I am actually about to transfer $11k of the $18,460 cash to our Vanguard TRF2045 for the 2015 tax year.

  I utilize PRE-TAX Dollars to pay for my wife's health insurance.  I also use Dependent Care benefits to pay my child's daycare with pre-tax dollars as well.

But I wonder, should we get additional life insurance?  
  
  On our mortgage we were able to qualify for a Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) which gives us a yearly tax credit of approximately $2k for our house/mortgage. When we crunched the numbers, if we do not pay the loan down early (which we are currently not) it will save us approximately $48k over 30 years. It is up to half your mortgage interest, maxed out at $2k, so the value drops in the last years of the loan. If we ever move or sell the house though the MCC is lost.  
  
  We would like to save for our child's college, but don't know which is the best way, especially with the way things might be changing in the education system (MOOC, Free AA Degrees, etc). Would just hate for us to put money into an account and it is locked up and stuck in there since it would be in a tax advantaged one.  Should I just put it in a taxed investment account? Or would one specifically designed for education be better?  
  
  Overall, I am just wondering if we'll ever be able to retire and help our child go to college.  I am pretty stressed out about this, as I have some health issues that makes it tough for me to work (Disabled, back issues) so I honestly don't know if I can work until my 60s or 70s (Unless some medical advancements can fix me up hopefully), so I really want to ensure my family is taken care of, as my wife may end up being the sole income in 20 years. When I run the numbers on those retirement calculators it doesn't look so promising. :(  Should we change our Vanguard TRF to 2050 or keep it at 2045?  
  
  We were hoping to have another child, but financially it doesn't look like that will be possible. Also, with the way technology is changing, I wonder if there is even any job stability, truly is wondrous and stressful time to be alive.

personalfinance,"Thoughts on investments, student loans","Hi PF!  I'm in search of some advice.  Here are some facts: my wife and I have about $110k in an investment account with an advisor that is charging about a 1% fee.  I'm thinking about taking that money and dropping it into a Vanguard / Fidelity account but I am pretty green when it comes to managing my own money. I figure I could save a lot of fees each year if I do this.  Generally speaking, is this a good idea?  

I have separate student loan refinancing questions as well. Basically I have about $100k in loans left over from law school that I am paying off.  All are variable rate and roughly $86k of them are private and mature in 15 years, while one is public and matures in about 3 years. Total payments on the loans are around $1100, which is too much to afford. All are around 4% interest and are variable rate, pegged to LIBOR. So I have been looking into refinancing options to make the payments more manageable.  If I bump out all maturities to 20 years from now, I will save about $350 a month, at a fixed rate of about 6.25%.  If I do variable rate again, it's around 4.25% and payments would go down even further.  I know I am costing myself more in the long run, but I feel that I will be able to make additional payments in a few years that can reduce the principal obligations even further and I am also concerned about potentially rising interest rates in the near future.

personalfinance,What to do with Tax Return Cash?,"Recent college graduate here, working full time since May of 2013, looking for advice.

I am somewhat uneducated when it comes to taxes and savings. Due to this, when I first set up my W-4 with my current employer, I decided to set withholding on my pay at a ""0"". After I filed my 2014 taxes I received a rather high tax return (IMO), $2,700. I plan on saving half my return and using the other half on either refinancing my car loan or using it to pay off my student loan debt. 

Currently, I owe roughly $13,200 on my car loan at a 7.6% interest rate. Additionally, I have student loans of around $23,000. My student loans are not consolidated and as of now interest rates range from 3.5% on larger loans to 6.5% on smaller loans. 

I have multiple accounts with Chase Bank so I decided to see what they could offer me in terms of refinancing my auto loan. I have been pre-approved for a 48 month loan of $11,700 at an interest rate of 4.3%. Also, due to currently banking with Chase they would be able to lower the interest rate an additional 0.5% if I enrolled in auto-pay from my checking account. However, if I do this I need to cover the difference of roughly $1,500 to get my current loan down to the approved $11,700. This is what I initially planned my tax refund to cover. If I do plan on refinancing I also have been thinking of making it a three year loan and not four.

**First Question:** Would it be financially smarter to put money towards the gap and refinance my auto loan or should I use it towards my student loans? 

**Second Question:** Should I look into consolidating my student loans into one loan?

**Third Question:** Should I consider trading my vehicle in? This is more of a want and not a need. Car runs great, no major problems. I keep up with maintenance regularly.

Supplemental information:

- My current vehicle is a 2012 Dodge Avenger SE. Roughly 68,000 miles on it. 
- Gross yearly income is around $50,000
- For all those who will most likely address this: Yes, I have been adjusting my withholdings and using an IRS tax calculator to better estimate so my tax return next year is much smaller.

economy,How will U.S. balance need to raise interest rates vs. increasing value of USD?,"The long held expectation, and re-enforced with current U.S. economic data is that U.S. interest rates will rise later this year, possibly as soon as June. Obviously it is necessary at some point to bring rates off the floor they have been on for the last several years. What I see as a problem though is that the U.S. seems to be to the only country looking to increase interest rates, and the USD is already very strong against other major currencies. The USD has climbed strongly in the past year to few years against major currencies such as the Euro, Yen, CAD, AUD, BRL, INR, RUB, ZAR. The only major free floating currencies it hasn't outperformed recently are CHF and GBP, although USD vs GBP has been strong in recent months, but this followed a significant decline in 2013 to mid 2014. Increasing interest rates will further increase the value of the USD against other currencies.

To me it seems that continued growth in the value of the USD presents a serious risk to US economic growth. There has been a significant increase in the amount of manufacturing jobs in the US in the past few years after so many were lost in the years leading up to the economic crash, but if the USD grows even stronger I would have to imagine this would erode to competitiveness of these manufactured goods for export markets. This loss of competitiveness seems to me to be a serious threat to undue much of the growth that has happened in the past few years in the US. Is there a way the Fed can deal with these dueling issues of needing to increase interest rates without causing an overvaluation of the currency, at least until other countries start raising interest rates as well?

TL;DR: USD at presently at high valuation, likely heading higher when interest rates rise, this threatens to erode export competitiveness and derail recovery. Other countries weakening their currencies at same time. How can US Fed balance need to raise interest rates without killing export related jobs?",finance,1425665108

I've read the wiki and post on how to prioritize planning for a large sum of money, but I feel like there are some unique circumstances at play here. To that end, a bit of individualized advice would be most appreciated. 

[Note: this is a new account due to the high level of personal information I'm about to divulge.]

BACKGROUND 

My SO and I have been together 7 years. We are unmarried as of now, but are planning to get married in the next few years. After working for several years, I went back to law school and will be graduating in 2016. He currently works, grossing about $90k per year plus bonus. I have obtained a summer associate position for this coming summer at a firm with a historical 100% post-grad offer rate. If all goes to plan, I'll be starting at $160k per year (plus bonus) at my job after graduation. We currently live and plan to stay in the SF Bay Area. 

CURRENT MATTER 

This summer, we will be receiving approximately $200,000. We're attempting to formulate the best plan of action for our future.

We currently have a 3-month emergency fund in a separate savings account. He contributes up to the employer match in his 401k (I believe 5%). Neither of us has any credit card debt. He has no debt, period.

Unfortunately, I will be graduating with about $150k in student loan debt, all from law school (mix of Perkins, Stafford, and GradPlus loans). 

OPTIONS? 

We had been thinking that we would use this money towards a downpayment on a home. The market around here is absolutely nuts, so it seems like the earlier we get in the better. We also loathe renting. 

In this scenario, we would purchase the home, and in my first two years working we would continue to live primarily off of his income and put 90% of my take-home towards my student loan debt until it is paid off, likely using the avalanche method and first targeting the GradPlus loans, which carry the highest interest rates. 

We plan to be in the Bay Area for a long time, and even if we moved we would likely hang onto the property to rent out. So I'm thinking that buying a home would at the very least be a net positive investment. But I'm not sure if it's the right one considering my outstanding debt. 

Is the second option, paying off my current debt ($90k) and the remainder of my tuition now, the smarter option? Or, is there a third option where we just invest the money for now and revisit this in a year or two? 

I'm also going to need a car once I start working full time, so I have to factor that into the equation somewhere.

Hey, r/PF,

In need of advice and suggestions, let me start off by saying that I made mistakes at an early age and now that I'm older and a bit wiser it's time to own up and do something to get back on track.

I am 30 years old, I am making roughly 72-73k gross a year (58k take home after taxes/401k/pension plan etc). I have private loans held through Navient at which have been in default for a very long time. The debt wasn't nearly this high, but obviously the interest rate has made the total due sky rocket. I currently owe 50k at 13.12% interest.

I rent a home from family at which my mortgage is roughly $700, add utilities and I'm right around $1,000.00 a month. I bring home around $1,5xx.00 bi weekly. Outside of school loans I have about 12k in debt, 4k left on a ring at which I had to finance for my fiancee (been paying it off over the past 2 months and it'll be paid off in 2-3 months), 4k at which I owe my father and $2.5k at which I owe to an old credit card from when I ran into student loan troubles. Outside of school loans, 12.5k is a small debt in my opinion, I can handle these, these are being paid and I'm tackling them accordingly. I plan to have these all paid off within the next 4-6 months, assuming I don't get hit with anything unexpected.

My troubles are obviously with the school loans, where to start, what to do? I contacted Navient today, they provided the numbers list above. They also said that the account isn't assigned to a CA as of right now, to call back next week and get the new CA's phone number. Obviously I would take this up with the new CA.

My question, how should I go about to get this resolved. I've read before about pay offs at a fraction of the total due? Should I shoot for this, if possible? If not, please advise!

Over the past 3 months I've done everything I could to lower my bills. I got rid of cable tv, changed insurance companies to save money, got the lowest and cheapest cell phone plan possible, changed ISP's and used corporate discounts when available (work from home, internet is paid by my employer), set a strict budget, removed all unnecessary expenses. I don't buy new clothes, I don't buy anything fancy. I drive an 18 yr old car, I am as frugal as can be over the past few months. I am on a $25 a month budget for going out expenses per month (restaurants). We coupon and take advantage of every sale possible when it comes to food (fiancee does the couponing). I'm sure there's more to it, from the savings stand point, this is just to show that I am taking every effort to save a dollar and handle my debt accordingly.

Thoughts and or recommendations please, I need to get myself out of this hole. I need to get my credit score up, I want to be financially strong, and learn to invest and make my money work for me. However, I have this huge debt hanging above me and I need to get the school loans corrected and off my record.

Edit: I spoke to multiple lawyers and haven't made any progress. They were very little help and or weren't willing to work with me, was hoping they would help me lower the interest rate and or help me out of this hole somehow. The item is to fall off my report in 2020, however I don't want this to ruin me for any longer, advice please!

I'm interested in single family owner occupied, but am also curious about how having tenants works in terms of additional requirements and expenses on that income. 

For example, as a tenant, I only worry about my rent, and any utilities that aren't included (usually electricity and/or gas). (As a side note, I find this to be quite inexpensive, I'm frugal, and in retirement I would expect my income to be so low that my tax burden would be in the lowest federal &amp; state 1-2 brackets, not much to write off.)

technology,"After learning my Senator (Thom Tillis R-NC) was one of the senators who helped create HR 1212 which will ultimately do away with Net Neutrality, I sent him an email. I got a response today.","My email: 

&gt; Mr. Tillis,
&gt; 
&gt; I want to strongly urge you to not support the ""Internet Freedom Act (HR 1212)"". Doing so will ruin the Internet as we know it. Without Net Neutrality companies like Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Verizon will be able to control what websites you and I get to see. 
&gt; 
&gt; The whole idea behind Net Neutrality is that all internet is treated equally, that is true internet freedom. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you pass this bill you will effectively allow Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Verizon to control the internet. They will no doubt put profits ahead of customers. This bill would allow ISPs to limit the amount of bandwidth going to websites unless they pay a fee. 
&gt; 
&gt; This will greatly stifle the growth of small business, especially those who do a great deal of business on the internet. 
&gt; 
&gt; I voted for you last election and was so proud to say I had voted for you. But I am afraid that if you vote to pass HR 1212 or a similar bill, I will not vote for you next election season and will make sure everyone knows you voted to give control of the internet to big corporations. 

[His response](http://i.imgur.com/BhyZggN.jpg)

Text of his response: 

&gt; Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding net neutrality.  I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.
&gt; 
&gt; Net neutrality is the principle that Internet Service Providers (ISP) will be required to treat all data traveling over the networks equally, rather than allowing ISP's to customize service offerings with their users and compete for more customers on the basis of quality and price.  It essentially imposes a one-size-fits-all business model on the Internet and represents an unprecedented government power grab to control and regulate the Internet, which is why federal courts have already slapped down the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) twice before when attempts were made to impose net neutrality mandates in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; As you may know, the FCC recently voted in secret to adopt net neutrality mandates and reclassify broadband Internet access services as ""telecommunication services"" under Title II of the Communications Act.  This would allow the government to regulate the Internet under the same rules designed for ""Ma Bell"" in 1934, which hampered innovation and growth for more than fifty years.
&gt; 
&gt; I support a governing framework for the Internet that allows more competition, more innovation, and more freedom of speech.  I believe that less government regulation, not more, provides for the best opportunity for the Internet to continue to be a major source of innovation and economic growth for the United States and the rest of the world.  When the issue comes before the Senate, I will carefully consider everything you have said in making a decision on what is best for North Carolina and the rest of the country.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me.  It is important to hear from citizens themselves on issues that affect the state and the nation.  Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again about other important issues
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,

Bitcoin,{Tinfoil Hat Time} Is Bitcoin the perfect replacement for cash?,"Ok, first of all I will admit to wearing a tinfoil hat on occasion. I see conspiracies in places most people don't bother looking. You may want to put yours on to better understand this post.

For some time now I have wondered about who actually developed bitcoin and what its true purpose was. I used to think that it was all about freedom from bureaucracy, privacy and all that Libertarian crap about controlling our own money etc.

Recently I have begun to wonder though if bitcoin is actually any improvement over cash at all at least in terms of privacy. You see with cash I can buy whatever I want and no one has any clue really where the cash comes from. Cash is by its own nature very difficult to trace even with serial numbers etc.

If the Federal government wanted the perfect traceable replacement for cash then bitcoin fits the bill because the blockchain never forgets. A bitcoin can be traced all the way back to its creation date. Sure, bitcoin is anonymous to a certain extent but in the conversion from fiat to bitcoin we are now seeing how dangerous the blockchain can be for privacy.

Coinbase has become the focal point of this recently with their requirements to verify your identity and their tracking of where coins come from and go to. Coinbase now monitors where you coins go after you buy them and if they seem to be used for anything remotely related to Money Service Business your accounts can be frozen with a total loss of bitcoins. There are numerous postings in this sub complaining about these issues and its only going to get worse in my opinion. With cash no one cares or even knows where it came from but with bitcoins you just have to look at the blockchian to see if came from some bad wallet address such as those from localbitcoins or even these darknet sites like SilkRoad et al. 

If coinbase can shut down your account because of where your coins are sent how can we protect ourselves? Sure we can all ""wash"" our coins but how many hops is needed to make the coins clean? If I spend coins with some service provider and he sells them on LBC or the darknet does that reflect negatively on my account somehow? How about stolen coins? If someone pays me for goods or services using coins stolen from some marketplace like BTC-E or whomever am I now responsible for receiving stolen property? Can my account be frozen because some thief pays me for legitimate services?

I have begun to wonder if Satoshi was in fact the Federal government and their end goal was to further destroy the use of cash and also make all transactions traceable. It's perfect if you think about. You can't hide bitcoins like you can cash. Sure you can tumble them or even trade them for altcoins but in the end all of that is traceable on the relevant blockchain. You can't counterfeit bitcoins like you can cash so our enemies can't keep printing wads of fake cash as they have been for years now. 

Until Bitcoin achieves mass adoption there will be the need to convert to fiat and with the many PR issues bitcoin has faced recently we may never see total merchant adoption. So long as people keep tying their bitcoin accounts to their personal id we'll come closer and closer to the perfect traceable system. In the same way debit and credit cards are perfect trackable devices for the Federal government so to is Bitcoin.

Now, before you come at me with ""This is an American problem, not my country"" that's only because your country has not taken the steps to regulate bitcoin yet. When they do it becomes our problem, not just mine.

So, my question to the bitcoin community is am I the only one who thinks bitcoin is the perfect traceable currency the Federal government needs to do away with cash? Has anyone else considered that maybe bitcoin is not better than cash?

personalfinance,"All-in-One Advice Request:Student Debt, Retirement and Taxes","Hey r/Personalfinance, I am sorry for the long post, but I wanted to provide as much useful info as possible in hopes that the smart minds here can help me out. Thank you!

I am a graduated student that is looking for some advice on my taxes, investments and debt repayment.
I am living rent/utility free at my parents and have student loans for a total of a little more than $30k.  I am currently working as a contractor on a 1099 and did so in 2014 as well.  For this reason my tax bill is quite large and these are my current options given that I have no retirement plan yet. 

* No retirement plan: $13,270 owed in taxes to Fed and State. 

* Retirement with full SEP contribution of $9,118: $11,309 owed in taxes to Fed and State.

The difference in these two options is a tax savings of $1,961. But the $9k to the SEP is a large chunk of money that I don’t think it’s wise to part with.

My preferred alternative is to put the maximum $5,500 into a Roth IRA; however, since I will need to pay taxes on that immediately and I am in the 25% Fed income tax bracket, does that mean I need $6,875 ($1,375 in taxes)  to contribute the full $5,500 to my Roth? 

In this case, I pay the full tax amount of $13,270 + $6,875 for the Roth = $20,145

Vs.

The SEP case: $11,309 + $9,118 = $20,407
Saving $262 and taking advantage of absence of tax on withdrawals from the Roth in the future  
The last option is to put $5,500 into the SEP instead of the Roth, which from my calculations showed an approximate $800 tax reduction.

SEP Case 2: $12,470 + $5500 = $17,970

My current contractor income is unstable so I am looking for a full-time job and expect to find something in the $50-$60k annual salary range, and plan on moving out of my parents’ home by summer/fall.

* 12k credit card debt

The plan: believe it or not, the credit card debt is on a 0% rate til 01/16, so we are gonna pay min for now. I've gone thru our budget on YNAB and have really tightened things and factored in that every month in addition to our min payments we can put an extra 2k toward debt. When calculating putting our tax refund and extra 2k each month down, we can have the home equity loan paid off in 10 months. At that point, all will extra will go toward the credit card and then home equity. I figure if we stay on a reasonable budget for the next few years we can wipre out the line of credit, home equity loan and cc debt.",finance,1425678080

Silly question, but I'm looking for a consensus opinion on this, I have a credit card with limit of 7.5K and an interest rate at 29.99%,  which has not been charged/used for over a year. This was my very first card at 18 (to start establishing credit). I'm, 27, now and a couple of years past my poorest financial habits. So I pay my balance twice a month, and only utilize cards with lower interest and rewards(flights/cashback). Those other cards are younger lines of credit by several years.

investing,What Do You Think Of The Titanium Dioxide Industry?,"I've been keeping an eye on Tronox Limited ($TROX) for a while. The company has paid dividend since 2012. It was in a general uptrend since early 2013, but recent slump in crude oil prices dragged it down with it. The stock has just reached its 52 week low, following today's stock market dip sparked by the fear of interest rate hike.

Tronox produces and sells Titanium Dioxide pigment and mineral sands - an industry I'm not familiar with. Titanium Dioxide, I read on SA, is used in making paint, plastics, paper, and pharmaceuticals.

Do we have any chemists, or other people familiar with the synthetics segment of Basic Materials sector, to provide their take on the titanium dioxide industry moving forward?",finance,1425696654
ethereum,couple of noob js API questions,"from the old Gavcoin html document i see the send function actually does this:

eth.transact({'from': x, 'to': gavCoinAddr, 'data': ['send', to, t + ''], 'gas': '2000', 'gasPrice': eth.gasPrice});

So the transaction data is an array. However looking at https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI it seems like nowadays the data should be a long hex number that is padded with a bunch of zeros up to 32 for every line/argument.

I tried making a sendTransaction api call with the latest specifications and came up with this:

web3.eth.sendTransaction({'from':8a3a3905cf28117ea7367a017ee506a714979452,'to':9710233cfedee9e36893282f9e1f5d5c70c85b09,'value':8000000000000,'gas':4000,'gasPrice':400,'data':00000000000000000000000000000000})

it doesn't seem to work in the alethzero js console or in a html doc.

personalfinance,"Repair house to rent/sell, money involved","Currently have a house that my brother and I co-own (I'm the only one on the mortgage though). We are at a situation where we both want to move out. Officially I want to sell the place, however, he is interested in renting the place. Either way, a few of the bathrooms upstairs are in pretty crappy condition, where we think we need to fix/remodel them no matter what.

Some information:
Purchased house in late 2011 for 82k, have 74k still left on the loan (making minimal payments). Loan is at 5% interest rate (seems really high). Currently mortgage payments are $600 a month, seems we are still paying PMI. It was an FHA loan. Zillow is showing the estimated cost as $152k, and renting for about $1100.

My thing is, I don't want to use much out of pocket money on this as I am a ""co-owner"" on the house. My brother put a larger portion up front which I have since paid back imo with throwing extra at HOA and other improvements downstairs.

Options:
Sell it as is - How does this exactly work, People are going to look upstairs and see that its pretty disgusting.
Fix up bathrooms, sell it - How much would this increase the value?
Fix up bathrooms, rent it - Having us two as owners makes it hard to imagine we will ever be making any money out of the house until the last option
Fix up bathrooms, rent it, few years later, sell it - I guess we are thinking we can get someone to rent it quicker then we can sell it.

I can't imagine my credit score being much above 700 (haven't checked in a long time) and my brother's score is in the gutter (we couldn't get approved for a dual loan with him on it). 5% on the current loan seems really high, it was a 30 year loan. I believe we need probably around 7,000-10,000$ to do repairs on the bathrooms (need to get someone to do the remodels). I don't have that much money available to me at this time. 

What can i do in say refiancing, getting a second mortgage, some type of home equity loan? I really don't know much of anything regarding this. I feel this purchase has been the worst purchase in my life as I don't want the place and want it off of my credit.

I have my masters degree, but I also have $50,000 in fed loans and almost $80,000 in private loans as a result from Sallie Mae's ridiculous 12.5% interest loans that accrued interest throughout college.

personalfinance,Micromanaging student loan debt/Mental games to stay encouraged,"I would love to hear stories from some of you regarding your approach to student loans.  How closely do you follow?  What ""mental games"" have you established to stay motivated?  I have found that following things on a micro level helps me stay motivated.  

I have a low interest (1.7%) student loan with a balance of just under $44K.  This is my one remaining student loan, and I would have paid it off years ago but the interest rate is low enough I chose to invest elsewhere for many years before finally getting motivated to pay this off.  

So one of the things that has helped motivate me to pay this loan off, despite the interest rate being tough to beat and the monthly payment being manageable (225/month), is I have started to calculate with each extra payment how the interest accruing daily has steadily dropped.  I can remember a time when I was paying $5/day in interest, before I started getting aggressive.  

No I am down to paying only $1.96/day in interest.  The balance is pretty large still, over $40K, but just seeing this small daily savings makes a difference from a motivational standpoint.  So I am saving over $3/day from when I first got started, and now saving $ 0.60/day compared to just six months ago.  

It would be easy for me to continue to ride this loan out, given the fact that the interest rate is tough to beat and the monthly payment not too large.  For my highest interest rate loans, when I first got started I would calculate savings over a decade.  If I paid an extra $1,000 toward a long term student loan at 5%, over ten years I would save $1,000.  That motivated me early on.  Now that I'm down to one loan remaining, I get more on a micro level and look at daily interest rather than what I will save over a longer period of time.  

Let's not let this thread devolve into the arguments for or against paying off low interest debt vs. investing elsewhere.  I think we are all familiar with those arguments.  I am still maxing out pre-tax investment accounts.  

I have found that looking at the daily interest in a dollar amount helps me stay motivated.  Even though my monthly payment isn't killing my budget.  I just want this debt gone forever, I am kicking it into high gear lately to get it out of my life.  

Curious to know if anyone else quantifies things like this, or has other tricks to help them stay motivated/stay on the path to debt reduction and/or investing.",finance,1425735128

personalfinance,Entrepreneur finally paying student loan debt. Need advice about structuring.,"**Background:** Graduated in May 2013 with a masters in biology (accredited state university, reasonably good program). I also graduated with a significant amount of student loan debt (all government loans with a range of rates, but an average of about 5.5%). Right now I have about 100k in debt. Recognizing that I would have to spend a number of years aggressively paying down this debt with the job prospects available to a bio grad (average salary is about 40-50k/yr starting), I took a chance on entrepreneurship. I have been in deferment since graduation, as I have had no income. I know that /r/PersonalFinance is committed to providing sound and reliable financial advice, and the way that I went about approaching this debt is directly counter to the “slow and steady” and predictable strategies which are often suggested here. My apologies.

Fast forward to today, and we are getting ready to land our first contract within the next couple of weeks, and I will have approximately 80k left over available to pay myself in the immediate future. I fully expect that following a successful completion of this contract (concludes July 2015), everything will be much more financially comfortable. That said, who knows what the future holds, and the first thing that I want to do is get rid of my student debt. It keeps me up at night, and I hate it. My wife works full time, and I can commit 100% of my salary/compensation to my debt.

My business is a Delaware corporation, I am the CEO living full time in North Carolina, and I own 80% of the equity. The remaining equity is owned by a partner who is fine with me paying myself finally (she is part time right now with our business, and has full time salaried employment at the moment) (~10%), a couple advisors (~6%), and an options pool (~4%). I am able to set my salary/compensation, and everyone involved is comfortable with this arrangement. This of course will not get rid of all of my debt, but it will make it much, much more manageable. I understand that I am to pay the highest interest rate loans first.

**Question:** What is the best way to structure repayment? Can I have the business pay my student loans directly instead of paying me salary? What would the personal/corporate tax consequences be? Should I use a credit card to pay the debt down, as to collect on rewards? If so, what is the best card for that purpose? Are there tax consequences to consider for paying the bulk of the debt at once? Are there any other “benefits” that I might be able to take advantage of while I navigate this process?

personalfinance,Pay off student loans ($245k) or save for a house?,"Hey, first time poster here, hoping someone can help. I just graduated from law school last May and I have no idea how to handle my finances. What is the best way to attack getting my student loans paid off while saving money for a house?

Relevant stats:

* Student loans: $245k (average is around 6.5-7%) (related question, should I refinance?)
* Savings: $30k
* Salary: $145k with bonuses (expected to go up 10-20% annually, with a large jump in 8-10 years)
* Wife's salary: Currently $0 (student), will go to around $30k in a few months, and will go to around $100k in Fall 2016.
* Mortgage: Based on our area, we'll probably need around $400-650k for a condo.
* Retirement account: Currently setting aside 10% pre-tax. 

I've thought of a few different options but I don't know what makes the most sense. As a starting point, how do student loans affect your ability to get a mortgage later?

* Option #1: Pay off the student loans as fast as possible. We could probably take care of them in around 7 years but we wouldn't have much saved and we'd probably have to wait on getting a mortgage (or use a much smaller down payment).

* Option #2: Go on income based repayment and pay the minimum payment until the bulk of the loans are forgiven. Use the money saved to put towards a downpayment for a house. This will incur a tax bill in the $100k range in 20 years, but we should be able to play ahead for this if we're only paying the minimum amount. Based on my math (the estimator on the federal loans website) it looks like we'd end up paying a lot less in total with this plan, but I'm worried that carrying the loans for 20 years will hurt my ability to get a mortgage. 

* Option #3: Something else? I'm open to suggestions.

Has anyone else had to balance huge student loans with a potential mortgage?

Forex,My reasoning for a Euro bottom call. What do you think?,"I'm calling the bottom in the Euro. And here is my reasoning:

1) Hedge funds have piled into the USD and their long positions are currently 2 standard deviations above the mean. They are basically as long as they have ever been. This is usually a good indicator of a top. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-03-07/where-hedge-fund-herd-was-parked-last-week-most-long-and-short-net-specs

2) Almost everybody expects the euro to weaken. I have seen nobody saying they would go long at this point. Furthermore, the bearish forecasts are all very bearish... Most call for parity or even dropping to the .80 range. It's the most doom and gloom I have ever seen. This is usually a good indicator of a bottom.

3) The euro has basically entered a parabolic free fall. Chart analysts are calling it a waterfall drop, and that's what it looks like. The EU is either the largest or second largest economy in the world (depending on how your definition). We peel off euro pips as if they are nothing, but each pip represents billions of dollars. A drop of this magnitude is not sustainable.

4) I've analysed each instance of QE. You can check out a large list of historical QE start times here (http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/13/01/Fawley.pdf).

At almost every QE start or monetary stimulating on a large scale by a central bank, we have seen the country currency actually jump, rather than fall. This is counter intuitive but it is true.

People either do not notice this or simply ignore it. Reports from everywhere say that the currencies drop when QE starts. In fact, the currencies drop when QE is announced, but rise when QE actually starts. Perhaps this would even explain why Draghi had such a long buildup to QE before finally saying it would start (he wanted to sink the euro, and knew they if he just announced QE to start immediately, it would rise, rather than fall.. so he dragged it out.)

Here are the instances of monetary easing and central bank balance sheet expansion starting. You can see for yourself what happens after.

Sorry about the poor formatting and the long post. But fundamentally, it seems that the moment a central bank STARTS large easing and central bank balance sheet expansion, the currency strengthens, rather than weakens. Announcing programs might cause weakness, but actual implementation of programs causes strength.

Could this mean a Euro bottom is in the cards, as QE is set to start on March 9, 2015? The announcement caused the Euro to drop through the floor. Could the actual start of the program cause a strong rally? Time will tell, but what do you think?",finance,1425757335
personalfinance,Investing in a house vs Paying off student loans,"Here's my situation:

- Monthly expenses: 1000 (generous spending)
- Parent's savings: 50,000

I was wondering if its more advantageous to save up to make a down payment with my parent's savings or to put everything I've got into paying off student loans.

I live in the bay area where real estate is going up like crazy and this might be a good time to cash in on a house that I can rent out to potentially cover some of my mortgage expenses.  Renting in SF just feels like throwing money in the water to me at this point.

personalfinance,Plans with car payment and ways to make money with money?,"Hey everyone, I've always thought about my financial situations as they've been ever-changing once I got out of college and I figured this would be a great place to look for answers. 

I'm 24 and graduated college a little over a year ago with minimal debt which was quickly paid off. My car at the time was as well, however it had a design flaw that would give it issues for the rest of it's lifetime so my dad suggested I purchase a new car which I did. The old car allowed a nice down payment, much more than I thought it was going to be so after a few months of owning the car the amount I have left to pay is a little over $12,000. So my situation currently has been living with my parents. I have very little expenses other than my car payments, insurance, gas, some groceries here and there, my gym membership, and any credit card purchases(which are almost always just gas purchases to build credit and I pay it off almost immediately). I have a full time job which pays well for someone my age in my area and I have a good amount saved in my bank account. I do not use a savings account because the interest is so minimal and I don't like having my funds fragmented into different accounts. My spending habits are responsible enough for me to not have to worry about overspending what I have. 

Now at the time of purchasing my new car my credit report was messed up from some of the things my dad had done like making me an authorized user for his credit cards when I was younger which wasn't supposed to be on the credit report to begin with. I was able to get a bank to provide me a loan, however the interest rate was higher than it would have been had I purchased the car now with my credit all sorted out and my dad's items off of it. I spoke to the bank about a refinance in person and they sent me off saying they'd get back to me in a few days to come in and talk about what was possible. They sent me a letter saying nothing could be done which left a bad taste in my mouth. I also looked into transferring the loan to another bank with a good interest rate for someone with good credit which I now am eligible for, however they want me to open an account and whatnot which I would rather not do. So now I've been wondering if it'd just be best to pay off the entire remaining balance now to bypass the interest. I would still have a good amount leftover from my savings however I've been saving for the purpose of a down payment for a house. I'd like to reach that 20% so I don't have to purchase the insurance and keep my potential mortgage low. I am incredibly naive about house-buying so if I'm missing something here by all means fill me in as well. But would paying off my car entirely right now be a good move? Or should I continue to with the 5 year loan and pay off monthly while saving for the house?

Also, on a side note I've always wondered if there was any way for the money I've been saving could be used to safely make more money? And I mean a substantial amount, not like $50 a year or something. 

I know that was a lot, so here's a TL;DR: Bought a car with bad credit, real credit is actually very good, interest rate is high, want to pay off the car entirely and would still have a good amount money still saved. Want to buy a house in a few years though.",finance,1425761997
personalfinance,"Thank you /r/personalfinance. I'm 19, I go to one of the most expensive universities in the country, I backpacked through Europe, and I am completely self-supporting. I wouldn't be here without you all!","First off, it's really, really hard.

I attend a private school, third most expensive in the country. I am on a LOT of financial aid, but I manage to pay my share ($20,000) every year. I struggle some weeks and sometimes live paycheck-to-paycheck but I'm doing significantly better now.

I've donated my eggs three times to pay for school. I work two jobs - totaling to almost 40 hours each week. I have to pay for all my medical expenses, my clothing, my food, my apartment (in NYC!), etc.

Some ask why I chose such an expensive school - it was only because my financial aid actually made it cheaper than any of the in-state schools in my home state. I didn't have the option to live at home when I turned 18 and the cost of attending a local community college would have been only marginally different and, personally, I prefer the resources at my current school.

I have taken out student loans every semester (only federal - sub, unsub, and Perkins). I'm on track to graduate as a certified high school English teacher - upon graduating, I plan to work in a public school in NYC, which, after 5 years, will result in most of my loans being forgiven (!!!). I am not in any credit card debt and plan to keep it that way. I am working on building credit and my credit score is decent! I have a few hundred dollars in a retirement fund too!

With a lot of the money I saved from work this past summer, I decided to do a little backpack trip through Europe! Maybe it wasn't THE BEST decision, but I don't regret it. My first vacation and I funded it all (2 weeks in London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Norway) by myself. The whole thing (travel to and from Europe, travel among countries, food, housing) for under $2k.

I was coming home from work today and I just felt so much gratitude. I remember visiting my dream school (current school) at 16 and thinking it was impossible. Now I'm here, doing what I love (education and reading combined!), and I'm in a pretty good spot financially, given what resources I have and where I come from.

But thank you all! I often ask myself ""WWPFD?"" (""what would personalfinance do?"") when I'm making financial decisions and it's really helped me. I'm not gonna lie - I am on shaky ground. Some weeks, if something falls through, I have to eat pasta and crappy lunchmeat for a week. Sometimes I have to ask for a quick loan from someone (I always repay on time!).

I dunno. Just thanks! :) My dreams have come true and even though life can really feel shitty, I'm happy and doing alright!

personalfinance,Removing PMI from a Conventional 30yr + Renovation Loan,"In 2013 I purchased my home, using Wells Fargo as the lender. The home was a foreclosure which was unlivable at time of purchase, so most Conventional Loans / VA loans I was looking to use wouldn't cover it. However, Wells Fargo had a product very similar to the more common 203k FHA loans, which allowed the property to be purchased and renovated using the same loan. It is not an FHA loan; it's considered conventional. The final sale price was 265K, it required just under 30K of work, and after completing the renovation the appraised value was $325. Because we came in with a down payment just under 10%, we had to have PMI (About $150/mo). 

We don't have any other debt and live pretty frugally, so I've been putting extra principal payments in each month to bring down our LTV, but I'm having trouble parsing when exactly I can request WF to remove the PMI. Their website mentions the standard verbiage from federal law (automatically removed when scheduled to reach 78% LTV, or lenders request when it reaches 80%), but I haven't been able to find anything that talks about what value they use in Renovation loans like this. Their website talks about the ""lower amount between the appraised value and the purchase price"", but  the purchase price in this case was artificially low because of the required work. Other sites mention if the loan is younger than two years, you need to show structural improvement, although considering all the renovation work went through them AND they did a second appraisal after the work, I would think that appraisal should determine the LTV.

I looked through our closing documents an there wasn't a PMI disclosure or anything that talked about removal, just talking about it in general terms. 

My interest rate is fixed 3.75, so I'd rather not refinance, but I'd rather not pay PMI any loner than i have to either. Does anyone have any experience with this type of loan?",finance,1425767697

She will likely start making $30-50k in about 5 years when she goes back.

My plan is to refinance my loans to get a better interest rate, and then put the monthly savings into paying off my wife's loans quicker since I don't believe I can refinance hers with mine and thus will still have a higher rate.

I was wondering if this was a good idea and if so, who I should be considering for the refinancing.

personalfinance,"Married filing separately with ACA, PTC","Does anyone know if it is illegal/my taxes will get rejected if I accepted a Premium Tax Credit through the federal Marketplace last year, I ended up getting married, and now want to file Married Filing Separately? According to the Marketplace and IRS websites you must file jointly in order to receive a PTC (unless you're in an abusive relationship or some other stipulations that my marriage doesn't qualify for). It's a little ambiguous, but it seems to me that if you DO file separately, you have to pay back the PTC you received in full. If so, that's great, I'm all for it, as long as it's legal. Perhaps I should I explain...

I make roughly $15000/yr, and my wife makes roughly $45000. We got married in July. Our joint income for the year exceeds the maximum for being offered any kind of PTC. So for taxes this year, the IRS sent me my 1095-A and asked me to fill out form 8962 which basically says ""you made too much and must pay it all back,"" but allows for an Alternative Calculation for Year of Marriage. Form 8962 is a rabbit hole of tables, charts, worksheets, AND publication 974, which is more worksheets etc. And it's all a mess. When I started filling out these forms two months ago, they were in draft form because the IRS had actually not finished proof reading pub 974. They finished it recently but it still has logical inconsistencies for the Alternative Calculation for Year of Marriage. It'd be too long to explain the whole thing, but I'll just say line 6 says don't fill out lines 7 and 8, go to Table 4. After the Table 4 treasure hunt, you eventually end up deep in Pub 974 with a line that says ""refer to line 8b."" Nope. It don't add up. 

Anyways, with this alternative calculation not working, they want $2161 back, the whole credit. But there's a stipulation on line 26(27?) that caps your repayment amount based on your income. Well, my wife and my combined income exceeds the barrier. BUT my personal income caps my repayment amount at $600. If we file Married Joint we owe $2800. If we file Married Separately I get back $150 and she owes $800 or so. But then back to my question... Can I file Married Separately? It's a little ambiguous. I'm gonna call the IRS Monday to ask, but I'm skeptical that they will even give me a straight answer. I've talked to them a half dozen times already and they don't even know what to do with the ACA.

I'm crunching the numbers and it seems like we would be just fine, but I'm just not sure. My take home pay is $1200 monthly and my boyfriends is $1360 after taxes on a bad month. He typically gets about 10 hours of overtime a week, amounting to $510 a month after taxes. He receives $237 a month in disability but pays $300 a month in child support. I receive $400 a month in child support. 

So monthly ""income"" (accounting for both child support payments) is between $2897-$3407. I tend to nanny other children randomly throughout the month and make a couple hundred but it's not consistent to where I would want to depend on or include that income. 

So here's the thing- I own our home. No mortgage. Taxes are $1000 a year. We can rent out the house for about $700 a month, rental income would be $560ish after taxes and insurance. The great news is that since there is no mortgage, overhead is really low so if it is vacant for a month or two it wouldn't break us. 

My boyfriend qualifies for the VA home buyers program. From what I understand, it's 0% down payment and lower interest rates. 

His vehicle is paid off. My vehicle payment is $240 a month. After next month, we will have no credit card debt and we do not have any student loans. Not much of a savings either, but I would like to have 3 months expenses in savings before we close.

The euro fell to an 11-year low against the U.S. Dollar for the third consecutive day, as currency traders weighed the divergence that may ensue from the start of a monetary easing program in Europe with a potential interest rate hike in the United States.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
EUR/USD closed at 1.0841 at the end of U.S. trading, down 0.0186 or 1.69%. The pair reached a daily-high at 1.0979 early in U.S. morning trading, before dropping 0.01% upon the release of a stronger than expected U.S. jobs report. In 2015, the euro has fallen more than 10% against the U.S. dollar.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
On Friday, the euro slipped below 1.09 against the dollar for the first time since 2003. The currency's plunge continues, as the European Central Bank is set to begin its€60 billion a month quantitative easing program on Monday. ECB president Mario Draghi announced on Thursday that the bond buying program will last until September, 2016 or beyond if the central bank does not approach its target inflation rate of 2%.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
Bond buying programs, such as quantitative easing, are pursued by policymakers as a way of stimulating the economy by driving up the market price of bonds. When bond prices increase, yields decrease lowering the rates for mortgages and other loans.
One far-reaching implication of printing vast quantities of a currency is that it drives down its value against other currencies on the foreign exchange market. The euro also fell more than 1% against the Yen and 0.85% against the Australian dollar on Friday.

More tellingly, the spread between 10-year U.S. Treasury notes (2.25%) and 10-year German bunds (0.39%) reached its widest margin in 25 years. Since late-January, the yield on 10-year U.S. treasuries are up more than 35%. The lower yield in German bonds, meanwhile, sent Spanish, Italian and Portuguese bonds spiraling to record lows.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
The dollar soared against the euro on Friday following the release of positive U.S. employment data. The U.S. added 295,000 jobs in February, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 55,000 above forecasts for the month and January's figure of 239,000. Employment growth, meanwhile, has averaged 288,000 over the last three months, as the current unemployment rate fell from 5.7 to 5.5%.

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. I discovered this subreddit a few weeks ago, and I've really enjoyed learning from the posts here.

I graduated in 2012 from a 4-year public university with a double major in Sociology and Global Studies. I have ~33k in student loan debt, and when I graduated I also had ~$5000 in credit card debt from trying to live above my means (I've changed my ways since then).

I've spent the last 2 1/2 years teaching English abroad, which enabled me to pay off all my credit card debt, as well as part of the medical debt from a surgery.

So, my current financial situation looks like this:

~$33k in student loan debt, all of it federal loans.

~$5,500 owed in medical debt from a surgery last year

~$6,400 saved to help me transition back to life in America (I plan to use this to buy a used car and pay for first month's rent when I'm able to move out)

I plan to live with my mom until I find a job. She lives in a smaller city with little job opportunity, so living with her for more than a few months is probably not feasible. It's a 2 hour drive one way from where she lives to LA.

As I've been looking for jobs, I've been getting more and more discouraged with the low pay, especially compared to the high cost of living in Los Angeles, where I'm planning to live.. I'm considering if I should go to graduate school (for higher education administration, and become an academic advisor), but I'm not thrilled with the idea of taking on more student loans.

I bought my house at the absolute bottom of the market about four years ago and I currently owe about $155,000 on it. According to Zillow, my house is worth around $375,000 Currently. So I have about $220,000 in equity in the house. I know Zillow isn't accurate, but even with a 20% or so reduction from the Zestimate, I still have more equity in my house than I owe on it.

My question is - is there anything I can do with the equity in my house to pay down my mortgage? I know I could conceivably do a HELOC, but then I'd be stuck with a monthly payment on that. My interest rate is super-low (30-year at 3.5%) so I'm not sure a refinance would reduce my monthly payment that much.

I know this is a very good problem to have, but I'm kind of at a loss for what to do with the equity in my house right now. The market is too high to cash out and move into something else and I'm very happy with my place. I'm just trying to find out a way to reduce my monthly payment somehow, and I'm thinking that with so much equity, there has to be a way to do it.

Anybody have any ideas?

personalfinance,Buying a house in graduate school: is it feasible?,"So I'm in my first year of graduate school in a low cost-of-living area (i.e. we can find houses for ~$110k). I make $25k/year, and my wife is currently looking for teaching jobs around here, where starting pay is around $30k/year.

I currently have $33k saved up, so I should be able to cover a 20% down payment. Both my wife and I have no debt. Both of us have reasonably new cars, so there shouldn't be any big expenses there in the near future. Also, we already have enough furniture, so that's not an issue.

Here's our current budget:

Income: currently, with just me working, it's $1800 after taxes. With both of us working (as it will be this fall), it should be closer to $4000.

Rent: $845

Electric: $90

Water: $50

Credit Card (gas, groceries, fast food, incidentals, gifts, etc.): $750

Cable: $125

Now, for the expenses of a house:

Movers: $450

Property Tax: $1200/year

Home Insurance: $2000/year? (no clue, honestly)

Closing costs: $5000?

Upkeep/maintenance: $2000/year

Home inspection: $1000

I created some code that calculates the cost of staying in an apartment for the rest of grad school vs buying a house and living there for the rest of my PhD (4-5 more years). For some scenarios ($100k home/$80k mortgage, assume we'll be here for 5 more years, 3.5% APR interest rate), we'd save $8500 over the next 5 years by buying a house instead of renting. However, in other scenarios ($110k home/$88k mortgage, assume we'll be here for 4 more years, 4.0% APR interest rate), we would only save a few thousand. Of course, that's all assuming that the house will be sold for the same amount that we buy it for, which doesn't account for inflation.

Basically, it seems improbable that it would end up costing us more money to buy a house than to rent an apartment (not to mention the fact that it builds up credit), and I just want to make sure I'm not completely missing some major expenses here. Also, if anyone has any experience with buying a house while in graduate school, I'd like to hear about it (if it worked out well, what didn't work, etc.).",finance,1425792403

My wife and I were married September of last year, she is a teacher ($42k gross), I am an engineer ($110k gross).  

My wife's student loans are income based repayments with the balance forgiven after 120 payments. In order to maintain her income based repayments, we were instructed to file married, separately.

Additionally, I itemize - I own a duplex in which we live and rent out the 2nd half, so I depreciate, write-off repairs, etc.  This appears to force my wife to itemize her taxes, which prevents her from claiming interest paid on said student loans (&gt;$2500), among other things.

I did my taxes yesterday using TaxAct - and my return was about 2/3rds of what I received last years ($3700 vs $6000); I claim 1 on my W4.  This is my wife's first full year of teaching, and it looks like she'll end up owing about $60 to Fed, and $550 to NYS, she doesn't know what she claimed on her W4.  She received over $800 last year with 1/2 years pay, so it came as a dramatic shock.

personalfinance,Tax Issues,"Unsure if this is the right place for this, but I figured someone might have a little insight into this. 

A couple years ago my wife and I were a bit blindsided when we received a letter stating that our entire tax refund (both federal and state) was being held from us due to an unpaid student loan. 

Come to find out, my wife had a loan that she apparently hadn't been paying. She had transferred schools at one point and when she applied for a new loan she just assumed that it was all going to be a part of her original loan, but that was not the case. So, she kept paying that original one, thinking it was going to both, and that put us in the position we were in. 

Now, admittedly, she was never good with finances. It was always very out of sight out of mind but we have worked very hard on restoring her credit and paying down her debt. 

She called and got on a payment plan that would eventually get her back in good standing. It took a while and they took just our state refund last year, but as of this past August she was back in good standing and everything should be good. 

Fast forward to yesterday when we received another letter stating that they would again be taking our state refund due to an unpaid balance. We have no idea why as she's been paying it on time and received a letter saying things were good. 

It says we can appeal, but does anyone have any experience with this? I want to make sure we call the right people. Is this just going to continue forever?",finance,1425829469
personalfinance,"My brother has cancer, is disabled and has $20,000 debt and rising. Yesterday I discovered my GF of 3 years has $120,000 in debt. Help?","There are three issues at play here. First, my brother (26) is fighting cancer. He's disabled and he can't work. He has roughly $20,000 in student loan debt. He has had tens of thousands in medical bills, which up until recently were paid for by an inheritance. The inheritance was very fortunate for my family, and I'm not sure how much is left, but that will likely run out in the next 1-2 years. After that it will fall on my parents and I to support my brother. My parents are not wealthy so it would mostly fall to me.

Issue two is my girlfriend's debt. I've always known she had a lot of debt, but she was reluctant to give me the exact amount. She had hinted that it was $50-$70,000. She has a bachelors in history, a masters in history, and a masters in library science. I've been pressuring her to tell me the exact amount for months, but she was afraid I would break up with her if I knew her actual debt. Well, it turns out she has $113,000 in federal loan debt, most of which is grad student loans. She has another $7,000 in credit card debt. She doesn't know the interest rates, but I assume her credit card debt has the highest. 

My GF and I recently relocated from the west coast to the midwest to help support my brother. I was able to keep my job and work remotely (I work in tech). My GF had to quit her job as a corporate librarian where she made $46,000. She is unemployed and has been looking for work for past three months. She hasn't received a single offer but has some prospects. I've been pressuring her to seek more lucrative work outside of librarianship.

We live together and I pay nearly all living expenses. She likes to go out to eat often and take weekend trips. I now recognize that I'm stupid for enabling this behavior. We weren't planning on getting married for a while anyway with my brother's situation. Now I'm even more reluctant because of her debt.

Third is me. I earn $93,000, I hate debt, and I'm really good at paying it off, even when I made much less. In a cruel twist of fate, I'll make my last student loan payment this week. My only debt is $8,000 for a car loan but I had planned on paying that off by July.

So, I'm starting to lose my mind. I pride myself in making good financial decisions and paying down debt quickly. Finding out my GF has $120k in debt was a punch to the gut. I love her and I want to make this work, but I might go crazy if I have to support both her and my family. I'll try to be positive. The fact is though that I resent her for making such poor financial decisions and relying on others to help her out. I resent myself for not tackling these issues sooner. My focus, however, has been on helping my brother.

Thank you in advance for your help.

**Tl;dr**

* Brother has cancer. I support him. He has at least $20k in debt

* Girlfriend has $120k in debt, is unemployed with few job prospects

* I earn $93k. $8k in debt. Debt is a pet peeve of mind and I might go crazy over this.


**Update 1**

Thanks everyone for your feedback so far. I appreciate it. Here's my response to some frequent comments.

* Yes to loan forgiveness for my brother. I'll look into that.
* I have no intention of helping my GF pay her loans until (and if) we get married. I agree with everyone's reasoning on that. I do, however, want to help her budget and strategize how **she** can pay these off herself. Obviously getting a job--any job--is the first step. If you have other ideas how she can tackle it, please let me know.

* Some of you mentioned that my brother should get SSID. My brother is getting money through social security, so yes, I think he's already getting that. Sorry for not mentioning it sooner.

* A lot of you are saying I should break up with her. I've considered that. It's definitely the rational decision. My GF and I have been through a lot though. She's very supportive of my brother and family as we go through this difficult time, not to mention moving cross-country. Breaking up with her makes financial sense, but she helps keep my family positive and hopeful. I want to exhaust all means of figuring this situation out before throwing in the towel.


**Update 2**

* Wow, made the front page of Reddit. Wish it were for something happier.

* Some of you have said that I'm being selfish for ""making"" her move or not being understanding enough. One thing to keep in mind is we moved to the west coast for her schooling, only to move back to the midwest (where both our families live) for my brother. Respectfully, I'm interested in financial help, not relationship counseling.

personalfinance,What would you do?,"Hi,

I am using a throw away because there is some identifiers in my main account posts. 

I could write a TIFU.. the long story is that my wife and I weren't on the same page with the finances. After she quit her job to watch over our first child it became my sole responsibility to carry all the expenses. We had another child a year later (2013 and 2014).

The loss of her job created gaps in my ""budget"". I say ""budget"" because it was never really a budget. I used credit cards to cover the gap and hid it from her to make it seem like everything was OK. It wasn't.

I ran up debt which included buying a new roof on 0% interest, approximately $12k+ in credit cards, and got behind on utility payments. I used money from accounts I shouldn't have touched without making a joint decision. 

It caught up with me. She finally saw the statements, we agreed to use seom emergency fund money to catch up with all the bills. Her mom is helping me by paying off the credit cards and i pay her a monthly payment. I refinanced the roof to not hit the interest and will be paying much smaller interest. 

Basically, i'm a failure as a husband and father.

We made a new budget. With the savings goals and putting money in envelopes for future variable expenses I am at zero.

My net income is $5200 per month, my new budget puts me at $5500 expenses per month (-$300). This includes fixed expenses and variable/unknown expenses. I recently found a second job where I can work weekends to bridge the gap with $500 net monthly.

So now my question:

Knowing that I am working 7 days a week now, would you take a job with a much smaller company for $15000 additional in salary, less benefits (i.e., no 401k). This is not the second job, but an opportunity to change my first job. The additional income outside of funding my Roth IRA will still help out in the month. I am nervous of the growth potential with the new company and I want to know if I am making the right decision by following the money.

Gross to gross is $8333 now versus $9583 with the new job. I know I am leaving some facts out. Any help is appreciated.

personalfinance,SLs and eligibility for IBR (or similar),"My H and SIL graduated college several years ago with large amounts of student loan debt. For my H, it totaled around 80k and I do not know my SIL's exact figure, but I know it was over 60k and probably more than that, since both chose private schools and my SIL deferred for some time after as well.

My H, luckily, had chosen an engineering-related field and I do respectably myself, and between us we have slowly whittled away at the loans - mine are paid off completely and his are down to &lt;40k, and at this point the minimum payment is nothing we sweat about anymore. We put ourselves through grad school while doing this. So this isn't about us.

My SIL has found things rather dicier since graduation. After finding herself dissatisfied with the real work available in her field, she ultimately went back for a MS in education and last year became a tenured teacher. However, nearing 30 she is still really struggling with living independently and is obviously frustrated. She would love to be able to buy a home, but it is simply not currently feasible for her to properly save for, let alone buy one. From a strictly PF perspective, she can't really even afford a decent apartment in this area without a roommate. 

The real crimp is obviously the SLs that she is still only making minimum payments on. I know that here are options available for people with high SL debt loads, but since we never pursued it I'm not sure what to suggest to her (she's been expressing a lot of frustration lately so this isn't uninvited advice). Can the reddit SL gurus give me an idea of what options might be available to her? Both of their debts were financed similarly, with several smaller (5k-ish) federal loans financed through AES, and a larger amount in private loans through Great Lakes, which I know both had consolidated. The GL loan is the killer because her minimum payment is around $600 on that one alone, but I'm not sure what if any options are out there for private loans. Suggestions?",finance,1425837381

I'm looking to refinance my student loans and am not sure how to go about it. A bit of background:

I'm 28 years old. Make $58,000, 811ish credit score (according to creditkarma) and have ~$28,000 in student loans. A mix of private/federal and sub/unsub. I currently pay $388 a month and put another $400 on top of that towards the loan with the highest interest rate (currently a brutal 11.5% that will be payed off once I get my tax return). I should be able to pay them all off in about 4 years, but I want to minimize my interest paid. 

Here's the loan info:

**Private Loans**

$11,377.98 at 3.25% (v) = $107.30/mo

$2,709.10 at 8.25% (v) = 32.31/mo

$2774.02 at 6.75% (v) = 30.90/mo

$939.06 at 11.5% (v) = 23.97/mo

**Federal/Dept Ed**

$4,185.42 at 5.75% = $72.83/mo

$1,707.66 at 6.55% = $30.35/mo

$685.97 at 5.35% = $21.54/mo

$264.33 at 6.55% = $8.46/mo

$2,973.35 at 6.27% = $54.27/mo

$386.83 at 6.27% = $7.08/mo

I've done some preliminary research and it looks like I could get ~2.82% variable APR ($153/mo) or ~5.44% via Citizens Bank if I go for a 20 year loan which would allow me to put $635 extra a month toward the loan and minimize interest. I've thought about applying to SoFi as well to see what rate I could get there as well. I can apply to multiple banks within a certain time frame to compare rates without killing my credit score with multiple hard pulls, right? Should I refinance all my loans, or just cherry pick the worst rate offenders? Also, if I get a rate that is lower than most, but above the 3.25% loan (see above), I shouldn't consolidate that into it, right? Most banks/services that I've looked into require a min. of $10,000 to start, but I'm hesitant to include my Federal loans even though I haven't used any of the benefits that come along with those.

personalfinance,Absurdly massive private student loan debt.,"Hello, PF! I am very new to reddit, but I am optimistic that I may actually be able to get some sound financial advice in a situation that typically only receives gasps or condolences. 

Now, first and foremost, I want to emphasize that I am fully cognizant of how absolutely ludicrous, stupid, and irresponsible my decisions were in amassing the debt I now labor under. Truth be told, I didn't expect to be alive when these loans came due, and so accordingly I acted with complete reckless disregard for my financial future. 

Currently I owe over $175,000 to 5 different lenders and have a measly AS in paralegal studies. My monthly minimum payments total about $1,300, with the smallest bill being a $50 monthly payment for a federal stafford loan. The rest are from private lenders, including PNC, Chase, and Wells Fargo, he latter being my most significant lender. My total debt with WF is around $80,000 with a monthly minimum of $800 on a 10 year term. Each loan was co-signed by my evidently equally financially illiterate parents. 

I'm currently unemployed, and none of the private banks give a shit. I have looked into every possible deferment or forgiveness or remediation option out there, and I don't qualify for anything. I'm currently paying out of pocket for a single 3-credit course at a local university, because this qualifies me for in-school deferment with WF. I know that it's a terrible arrangement because interest continues to accrue while I'm in school, and upon completion it's added to the principal amount so I end up paying interest on interest, but paying an $1,100 tuition bill over a four month period is far more manageable than paying $3,200 to WF. I'm operating in emergency mode, trying everything I can to avoid default and just barely keeping myself above water. My credit score is garbage, of course. 

Bottom line is, I feel 100% hopeless in this situation, not only in the present circumstance but in the long term. It seems like even if I scrape by here, my credit and finances are so fucked that they'll never be salvageable. I know it's my own fault, but I don't know how to fix it and there are seemingly no ways for me to ease the burden. I can't apply for a consolidation because nobody will give me a consolidation loan for $180,000. I do have a prospective job in process, which could end up netting me about $31,000 annually after taxes, but that barely covers the loan payments. If I'm meeting the monthly minimums, I have to earn double the poverty level to still live in poverty. 

Is there any possible way for me to work my way out of this? I have no immediate or reasonable opportunity to make enough money to live AND pay these loans. My co-signers can barely cover their own expenses and occasionally can contribute $300-$500 a month, but I am primarily on my own here. Am I doomed to wage slavery for the rest of my life? 

Any help or advice would be immensely appreciated.",finance,1425873811

Our car and health insurance covered 90% of all medical bills, and my dad paid the other 10% with my mother's life insurance policy.

Apparently one bill slipped through the cracks. At the time I had bills from three different hospitals and several doctors and firms, etc. It was for $135 for some outsourced radiology lab to look at my xrays. We never paid it. But we also never received any notification of the bill to our knowledge, certainly not a post due bill or a notice that it had been sent to a collection agensy. I wasn't aware of the bill at all until I got a credit report. I had to google the collection agency the bill was sent to. When I called to try to get it settled they told me it was now over $400 due to interest! My dad refused to pay and hung up on them. I can't afford to pay it. I work for 10 dollars an hour 10 hours a week (and most of that goes to my car) and I go to school. 

My dad says that it won't affect my credit score that much and even if it does it doesn't matter if my credit score is shit because his is fine and he'll cosign for anything I need. I pretty much think that's bullshit but my dad is determined that this is true.

To be honest I'm suspicious of the charge because I can't even recall the original bill and the firm they supposedly bought it from isn't part of any of the hospitals I went to. Also their interest rate seems incredibly high and since when do collection companies charge interest?

Any advice would be appreciated!

EDIT: I forgot to add, I'm in a lawsuit now with my mom's auto insurance company (basically I'm suing her but her insurance would pay) I'm worried that the collection agency would garner the settlement for much higher than they should claiming their 15% interest rate as an excuse.",finance,1425888794

Apologies in advance for the wall of text.

Background details:

23 y.o. 1st year medical student, avg monthly income from financial aid: 600/mo till July (3K in the account to stretch until August 1st)

SO is 24 y.o. photographer for a corporate studio, take home pay 1650/mo, not including overtime, which is substantial around the holidays (Doubled her take home for the 2 weeks before Christmas).

4 credit cards, in both of our names: 

Amazon card (via Chase) 2K limit, we use it to buy groceries and have never had to pay interest. 

Discover Card, 500 limit, FICO score included with statement.
Both have 5% cash back.


Lowe’s store card, 2K limit, currently unused.

Staples store card, 800 limit, also currently unused.

Other Debts: 

Car loan: ~12K financed @ 4.75%, monthly payment $226, financed in my name only.

Her student loans: 200/mo, in her name only.

My Student Loans: ~25% subsidized, all currently deferred while I’m in medical school.

Emergency fund of $250. This was originally around $800, but one-time moving expenses and her not working for the first 3 months depleted it.

Last Credit score: 696


SO didn’t get her job till about 3 months after we moved, things were extremely tight then, and are *slightly* more relaxed now.

Current monthly bills:

Rent: 810
Utilities (power, water, internet): 200
Groceries: 250
Car Insurance: 145 budgeted monthly, paid every 6 months
Medications: 30
Gas: 40
Total, with car note and her loan payment: 1901/mo

That leaves around 350/mo left over each month. She also spends about 100-150/mo on lunch at work (~$4-5/day), though she’s trying to start taking lunches to cut down on that. We have an entertainment budget of about 50/mo, which goes mostly to Netflix, kindle books (that we get 5% back on) and online gaming. I’ve been hanging onto the extra 100 or so a month, with the intent of holding as an emergency fund, but at the moment it’s still mixed in with my general account.

 I’ve recently started using YNAB, and am in the process of adding in all the bill and account details (neither of our banks allow statement export as anything other than pdf)

Future Possibilities:
I've applied for several research positions on campus. If I get accepted, there’s a 2200 stipend to work as a research assistant over the summer.

Also, my SO is on-track to replace the current studio manager when she leaves later this year (around May/June). This would be about a 33% pay raise, in addition to 5 hours of guaranteed overtime per week, or about ~500/mo extra on top of the 33% raise. So overall a 58% raise (before taxes). No one else is currently in training or qualified for the job, so it’s almost as good as done.
I’m not going to *rely* on these two things happening to make ends meet, but I will include them in my plans.

Plans:

* Minimize spending wherever possible (i.e., making lunch at home and taking it to class/work)
* Look for a good savings account (considering ally, for the 0.99% interest)
* Move more of our bills onto the cards (paid off every month) to maximize cash back.
* Once I have a decent savings account, start building my emergency fund back up to 4-6K (2-3 months’ worth of bills)
* Consider merging our bank accounts (we’ve been together 8 yrs) so that our finances are easier for me to manage (I’m bad at financial things beyond basic budgeting, but good at organizing and planning)
* Look into other savings options/maybe an IRA, though I have less than 0 idea how to go about that . . .
* Keep hunting for scholarships so I can cancel parts of my December loans.
* My SO wants to start looking for a house once things get more stable financially wise. I’d like to wait until we have that emergency fund built up to start looking.
* Once our emergency fund in built up, I’d like to divert most of our spare cash towards paying down our loans, most likely hers since they have the highest interest rates.

So…having next to no practical experience with managing my own household, I’ve had to go with what I could glean from research and guesswork. Are there any glaring flaws with this setup? Anything I can do better? Any suggestions or ideas? I’ll take any advice you guys can give, gladly!

Forex,Brent oil futures fall below $59 on bearish OPEC comments,"Brent oil futures fell to the lowest level in almost two weeks on Monday, as bearish comments from OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri weighed.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for April delivery hit an intraday low of $58.88 a barrel, a level not seen since February 25, before trading at $58.99 during European morning hours, down 83 cents, or 1.39%.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries should not lower production to ""subsidize"" higher-cost shale, OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri said on Sunday. His comments came at the Middle East Oil and Gas conference in Bahrain.
Oil prices have fallen sharply in recent months as OPEC resisted calls to cut output, while the U.S. pumped at the fastest pace in more than three decades, creating a glut in global supplies.
On Friday, London-traded Brent prices dropped 75 cents, or 1.24%, to end at $59.73 as the U.S. dollar strengthened broadly following the release of upbeat U.S. employment data.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
The Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 295,000 jobs in February, far more than the 240,000 forecast by economists.
The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.5% from 5.7% in January, the lowest since May 2008. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate would fall to 5.6%.
The robust jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates as early as June, boosting the greenback.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.3% to 97.45 early on Monday, after hitting an 11-year peak of 97.84 earlier.
Dollar-denominated oil futures contracts tend to fall when the dollar rises, as this makes oil more expensive for buyers in other currencies.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
Elsewhere, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in April dipped 10 cents, or 0.19%, to trade at $49.53 a barrel. Nymex oil prices slumped $1.15, or 2.27%, on Friday to end the week at $49.61 a barrel.
Industry research group Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) said Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. fell by 63 last week to 923, the lowest since June 2011.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
Market players have been paying close attention to the shrinking rig count in recent months for signs it will eventually reduce the glut of crude flowing into the market.
However, total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 444.4 million barrels as of last week, the most in at least 80 years, indicating that cheap prices have yet to affect output.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
The spread between the Brent and the WTI crude contracts stood at $9.46 a barrel early on Monday, compared to $10.12 by close of trade on Friday.
Elsewhere, China reported a trade surplus of $60.6 billion in the January-February period on Sunday, compared to expectations for a surplus of $10.8 billion and up from a surplus of $60.0 in January.
http://www.myforexnowbox.com/
Exports surged 48.3% from a year earlier last month, above expectations for a 14.2% increase, while imports tumbled 20.5%, much worse than forecasts for a decline of 10.0%.
The slide in imports pointed to persistent weakness in the economy, fuelling speculation policymakers will have to introduce further stimulus measures to boost growth.
China is the world's second largest oil consumer after the U.S. and has been the engine of strengthening demand.
Meanwhile, the euro was likely to remain under pressure as investors looked ahead to a meeting of euro group finance ministers in Brussels later in the day to discuss proposed Greek economic reforms.

We'd use this cash to buy anything we need that's not budgeted. If we need clothes, want to go to the zoo, go bowling etc. So that's $400/month. This amount may change, and if I don't spend $50/week then I don't, and I'll throw that money at a card.

I've already paid off 2 credit cards that were about $900 each that were high interest. I'd like to put $2,000 savings, and save $800 to redo our floors since the plan is to sell the house once we're in a decent spot and the floors need to be redone.

The way I look at it now is we have **$289** not accounted for after we give ourselves spending money (this will probably change). I didn't budget my OT pay, but it's typically about **$350/month**.

So with overtime and unaccounted for cash we have excess of **$639.00**

personalfinance,Advice on keeping part of my emergency fund in a Roth IRA.,"Considering the abysmally low interest rates on savings accounts.  I have decided on keeping roughly half of my $20,000 emergency fund in a roth IRA.  I have not contributed towards one before and originally wasn't going to fund a roth IRA since I still owe a lot of student loans at 6.55%.  But instead of my emergency fund dwindling due to inflation, I thought it might be a good idea to fund a roth ira for both 2014 and 2015 with $11k of the emergency fund money.  And then maintaining 10k in savings.
 
My main question is this.  I plan on opening it with Vanguard and am curious as to what my asset allocation should be.  I am thinking I should have a higher bond allocation than I normally would, since it would be bad for part of my emergency fund to get hit hard if the stock market falls.  What ratios for bond/USstock/International stocks would you suggest?  Is there a specific vanguard fund that would meet these ratios? Do you think this sounds like a decent idea?

personalfinance,Would this be a bad decision?,"I work at a car dealership. My job involves working very closely with our mechanics that service our cars that are going to be put on the lot for sale. 

We just took a 2006 Mazda 3 on trade that's got 115k miles on it, but is immaculate. Perfect service history, no leaks, perfectly clean undercarriage, new tires and brakes. We don't get too many cars in this nice unless they're new-ish.

 I drive a 2012 ford focus S (fleet model) and owe about $8500 on it with 3 years left on the loan. My interest rate is 2.7%, 4 year term.

I'd get the mazda for right around what we paid for it, $3500 dollars, which i'd pay off in 1 years time instead of 3 years for the focus. I drive around 18k miles per year, so in 3 years my focus will have over 100k on it, and will likely be worth about what the mazda is worth. Assuming no accidents and everything being mechanically sound, the mazda is nearing the point where it wont drop too much in value regardless if it has 115k or 160k, so in a couple of years if needed I could sell it for about what I own it for.

Assuming I could get a similar interest rate for such a small amount of money, which I'd likely try to go through my bank, USAA. Would I be making a bad decision moving into this older car, with more miles, to get out of a car payment 2 years earlier?

personalfinance,Working to get out of debt and save for a house. Encouragement needed. - Long Post Warning.,"My fiance and I were on the right track to pay down a lot of our debt in 2014 and then things went off the rails when a frozen pipe burst in our condo on January 2nd. Anyway, after pretty much all of our furniture was destroyed and we collected what we could from insurance we had quite a bit of expense on our hands to replace what was lost (water ran for over an hour while the building management tried to shut the water off). We lived in a hotel for two months and insurance paid for that, and a bit of money per day to live on. Not enough to pay for food each day but thankfully we took advantage of the free breakfast at the hotel but still had to pay for lunch and dinner. We then lived with my mother for a few months. While our condo was being repaired we decided that it was time to sell it. It was a bachelor pad and only 1 bedroom and pretty small so it was very tight for two of us living there. Once the repairs were done (paid for by the condo association) we put the place on the market. Long story short, it took way longer to sell then we thought and we ended up paying rent and the mortgage for about 7 months. This is where the debt racked up. We had to move and moving back to the condo was not an option which I will explain. I am also physically disabled and around this same time things started to go downhill for me. I had just started working from home and thankfully my job let me do that as long as I agreed to switch from a salaried employee to an hourly one. That cost me a little income, as I now only got payed for the time I spend working but it was really not a big deal as it is a pretty high paying job and my fiance has a pretty high paying job as well. As my physical abilities started to fail me my fiance was also given permission to work from home so that required a bigger place as her job requires a much more substantial desk setup, etc...

Condo sold in December and I have been plowing as much money as I could into our debt. Here is where we are at.

Credit Card #1 - 4152.00 (started paying this one down in February 2015 and the balance was almost 7000 when I started)

Credit Card # 2 - 7400.00 (this one has a lower interest rate so that is why I am focusing on number 1 first)

Car Loan - 24,591.06 (I don't drive anymore so this is the only car between the two of us. It is a minivan that we had to purchase to accommodate a lift in the back for my powerchair. My fiances card had almost been paid off before this but we had to get this vehicle to get where we needed to go for doctors appointments and such.)

Student Loans - About 20,000 (fiance is a nurse and this is her schooling bill)

Loan from relative - 12,000 - no interest and no rush to pay this back. Had to borrow money to sell condo.

That is about it.  

As you can see, this is pretty daunting and I am trying to stay positive and keep telling myself that we can do this but I wish there was a way to do it faster. Any advice or encouragement would be appreciated. I would be open to any suggestions for getting this done as well. Should I worry so much about the car and student loan stuff and starting putting some money aside for the down payment on a house instead?

I have been a longtime lurker of this subreddit and am in need of your assistance. I tried searching the web but could only find vague answers, I am sure others have also had similar questions but I cannot seem to find the answers. Thank you in advance.

In 2014, my brother and I decided to start a small online business. All transactions were performed online via a 3rd party (electronic payment processor). Unfortunately business didn't go so well and we have temporarily suspended everything while we plan our next move. 

I recently received form 1099-K which lists my total revenue of approximate $40. I also paid my state tax every quarter via the Board of Equalization for all sales.


This is my first year of owning a small business so I would appreciate some words of wisdom from more experienced users


1) Do I still need to file even though the income was so low?


2) Are the business earnings filed under the business's name or the individual? Would I be claiming how much of the $40 was mine ($20 in this case) during my own taxes or would I have to file a separate document for the business itself?


3) Do I need to file any documents pertaining to total revenue on the federal level? (I did so for the state via [www.boe.ca.gov](www.boe.ca.gov))

personalfinance,"Unscrupulous Employer, Taxes, Ethics","I worked at a restaurant for ~2months as a waitress. I kept track of my total income per day (base pay, cash tips, and credit card tips as one number). I deposited it at the bank after every shift. I will be claiming this money ($3,381) on my taxes no matter what. That is not the question.

The question is really an ethics question. I know I should have gotten a W2. The owner did not send one, and will not provide one. The owner had his accountant talk to me and the accountant said (with far more diplomatic couching than this is about to sound):""pay your own taxes"" and when I asked him for his advice on how I'm supposed to do that without a W2 I was told to ""file a Schedule C"". In case it matters, the accountant did get a little blamey with me, insinuating that I failed to provide the needed information. I corrected him, letting him know I tried, but was rebuffed. The accountant backed down a bit after that, and at that time took the 'pay your own taxes' strategy. I know filing a schedule C would be misleading and likely unlawful.

For context, the restaurant did not withhold any taxes from our pay and did not record any of the cash tips (though it did take a nominal percentage of our credit card tips back in order to cover credit card transaction fees). I suspect they are hamstrung in their ability to back correct the issue. 

The interpersonal factors at play:

-The owner is older (50's), generally unskilled, and his business partner is MIA entirely. He has said he hates what he does and would do anything else if he could, but he can't due to lack of skills.

-He has always complained that business is 'bad' since I've known him, and with my extremely limited experience to guide me, this seems to be a truthful assessment

-He systematically does not put new employees on the books until they've been there 'awhile' (however long that is?), and I think he sees himself as doing us a favor by allowing us the opportunity to tax evade. Like, he sees it as a win-win. I do understand the arguments for that view.

-I don't like him and I don't respect him. He is the sort of person that is horrible to subordinates out of a persistent lack of stress control rather than any sort of malice. However, I pity his predicament as a restaurant owner next to a big expensive city. If his business would burn to the ground, I'd probably be happy. I avoid walking home on routes where I'll have to look at the place. 

- I think what he is doing is illegal, benefits him more than his employees, and that taking the credit card tips is wage-thefty. I don't buy this idea that it is for my benefit or anyone else's on my level. All the waiters and waitresses are young (enough not to know better), the turnover his high, and the only vaguely permanent people are teens or immigrants (probably legal immigrants).


**TL;DR:** I'm afraid that if I'm honest in my filing (using a 1099 or the schedule C but including a letter better detailing the circumstances without making any accusations), it could touch off a tax audit for the restaurant and close down his business. Which, I think whatever comes in afterward will be better for our community because I think he has poor business sense....**but I don't want to see an old man loose his livelihood or end up destitute or loose his social net.**

I know the whole thing about not withholding too much and expecting large refunds and giving uncle Sam interest free loans, so in light of that and me getting thoroughly frustrated with the Colorado Department of Revenue's sheer ineptitude I've decided I would prefer to just keep the money I'd be giving to Colorado every paycheck and put it in as high of an interest savings account as I can get my hands on and then when taxes are due hold onto it until the first week in April and then finally use it to pay the state taxes I owe to Colorado.

My HR Department looked into it and provided me with a W-4 that I can sign and set this type of withholding up for myself, but before I went through with it I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something or that I wouldn't have to pay Colorado every quarter to avoid paying estimated taxes like some incomes types require with federal taxes.

technology,"I sent my representative an email about Net Neutrality and the new ""Internet Freedom Act""","What a pleasure to hear from you.  Thank you for contacting me to share your concerns regarding action taken by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate the Internet. Hearing from constituents on issues of concern is important to me and our office as we work to represent our district.
 
There is significant discussion about the term ""Network Neutrality."" The debate focuses on how to foster investment, create jobs, and competition in both the physical broadband network and in the applications that ride over that network.  I believe that access to the Internet should remain open and free from the heavy hand of unelected federal regulators. The Internet Service Providers (ISPs) contend that they will be discouraged from undertaking costly and risky build-outs if their networks are subject to open access and/or non-discrimination requirements. On the other hand, independent applications providers argue that in order for them to best meet the needs of end users and offer innovative services they must have nondiscriminatory access to the physical network. In the absence of any case being made for market failure, to me, all Net Neutrality is, is a solution in search of a problem.
 
In the final days of the 111th Congress, former FCC Chairman Genechowski moved forward with a vote approving the FCC's ability to fully implement Net Neutrality. In response, Verizon filed a lawsuit contesting the legality of this move. On January 14, 2014, a Federal Appeals Court issued a ruling in Verizon v. FCC stating that the FCC had overreached its authority when issuing Net Neutrality rules.
 
It is my steadfast belief that any change of this magnitude to the communications industry should be made by Congress and not the FCC. Additionally, both Democrat-and-Republican led Commissions in the past have all concluded that broadband is not a telecommunications service as the FCC contends, but an information service outside the reach of Title II common carrier rules. We do not need to regulate the Internet under the same laws created in the 1930s for Morse code.
 
Allowing the FCC to regulate the Internet will lead us down the road of the federal government picking winners and losers by restricting the flow of information across the Internet, similar to the Fairness Doctrine. The Internet is the last open public marketplace and I have no doubt that its openness is the key to its efficiency and success. In today's on-the-go digital community the last thing we need is to unnecessarily impede the efficient flow of information by inserting the heavy hand of federal regulators.
 
On Feb. 26, 2015, in a 3-2 decision, the FCC voted to adopt what Commissioner Ajit Pai has termed, ""President Obama's 332-page plan to regulate the Internet."" President Obama has not only sought to regulate healthcare, housing, the banks, and the auto industry, now he's regulating the Internet. The Internet is not broken. A study conducted by the Progressive Policy Institute concluded that re-classifying the Internet like a public utility would result in $11 billion of new fees and taxes. Any time the government inserts itself into a business process, we see higher costs and less access. After the FCC's recent decision, I fear this is where the Internet is headed.
 
In an effort to preserve a free and open Internet, I re- introduced H.R. 1212, the Internet Freedom Act of 2015 on March 3, 2015. If enacted, H.R. 1212 would invalidate the FCC's new Net Neutrality rules by stating they shall have no force or effect. It would also prevent the FCC from reissuing new Net Neutrality rules in the future. You can rest assured that I will remain very engaged in the debate to prevent the FCC from regulating the Internet and implementing their new rules.

I just got word the IRS approved my tax return. It will be just over $11k. A breakdown of my personal debts includes:

- $10k federal student loans
- $35k CC debt (most accrued from the business)
- $4700 vehicle loan (set to mature in September)
- $16k second vehicle loan (less than  a year old)

If I am at all considering bankruptcy (which is a last option), should I consider knocking out the student loan since that is not dischargable in court? Should I knock out the higher interest credit card debt?

The rental property is going on the market in about 2-4 weeks. Once it sells I expect another 25-30k to come in and my plan was CC debt.

personalfinance,Refinance using a HELOC? (x-post from r/realestate),"Someone in r/realestate recommended that I post this here. 

I would love to learn a bit more about refinancing using a HELOC, as it is a new concept to me.

Some Background: I bought a 4 unit house in 2012 and live in one of the units. Bought the house with an FHA mortgage, 3.625% interest rate, 3.5% down payment. Appraised value at time of loan was 425k. I currently owe $385k (~90% LTV). My current payment (P&amp;I) is $1876.24 per month, and I'm adding an additional $330 in principle each month ($2,208 total).

I am looking for a way to get out of the PMI of about $400 per month. I am talking with a bank who is offering a fixed rate line of credit option at 3.89%, 20 year term. Monthly payment (P&amp;I) would be $2,300, which is $100 more than my current total payment.

Paraphrasing what I was told: 

Basically, I would apply for a line of credit, currently at 3.50% variable, and then exercise a fixed rate option. The fixed rate option allows me to fix all or a portion of the outstanding balance at a fixed rate. Currently they are offering 3.89% on amounts greater than $100,000 for a 20-year term. If I were to get a line of credit, I could then fix the entire balance at 3.89%. As I pay down the balance, the line would have money that would be able to be re-advanced.

Based on my calculations, the fixed rate line of credit option would result in about 7k more total payments, but I would be saving about 19k on PMI (48 more PMI payments until I get to the 78% LTV I need to get rid of it).

The numbers seem to work out, but I would be interested to hear some reactions to this approach. If I go with a line of credit vs. a conventional mortgage, will it have tax implications, any impact on my credit score or obtaining financing for a future investment property?",finance,1425932090

My wife and I are lucky enough to have plenty of equity at this point of our lives due to windfall.  We own both of our cars and our house outright.  We have an emergency fund.  We also have about $30k in debt - roughly $21k in student loan debt (at 6.8%) and $9k in credit card debt (a combination of some bad luck and a few bad spending decisions - lesson is learned and our budget is in the best shape it's been in.  We are living frugally right now).  It's also worth noting that I moved $2k of the credit card debt to a no interest card already, so I'm not as worried about that as I am the other $7k.  I can throw around $300-$400 at the credit cards every month but it seems silly to pay that interest.  

In my mind I have a few options:
1) Get a home equity loan to consolidate my debt
2) Use a big chunk my emergency fund to pay down the credit cards.  Rebuild my emergency fund afterwards slowly.
3) Use a big chunk of my emergency fund to pay down my credit cards and boost my debt, and THEN get a home equity loan to give me some more cash flow and see if I can lower the interest on my student loan payments (a 15 year term on a home equity loan would essentially do this).  Use any extra money in the home equity loan to build up emergency fund, improve the house, buy my wife a car in a couple years when hers dies, put more into retirement, etc.

Thoughts on best options?  The biggest home equity loan we'd consider taking out would probably be $50k, which is a little less than one year of our combined incomes.

One more thing on home equity loans I'm curious about - has anyone thought of investing home equity loan $ into a fund with the target goal of earning more interest than the interest lost to paying off the loan?  Been playing with that idea as interest rates are pretty low right now.",finance,1425935623

personalfinance,Student Loan Payment Distribution,"I am currently a university student (in my 3rd year). I have private and government loans from my first two years as a student (details below). For this current academic year (and presumably the following academic year) I only have government loans.

I moved off campus this year and thus do not have to pay as much for housing/dining and therefore do not need private loans anymore. My university grant/government loans currently cover my school expenses.

This year, I've focused a lot on getting my personal finances in order. I budget using YNAB, got a credit card and have started building my credit (on time, full payments every month!), have developed a comfortable emergency fund, and browse PF every day.

I work a very well paying IT job for my University. After budgeting for bills, groceries, and a, imo, modest lifestyle, I have approximately $100/month leftover. Recently, I have started putting this money toward making early payments on my private loans. I also receive a quarterly stipend (~$1000) for a second job that I work and have put this toward the loan when not building my emergency fund. Here is the breakdown of my current loan situation:

Year 1

* (WF1) Wells Fargo Loan - Principal: $11,000, Outstanding Interest: $932.08 (After multiple payments totaling $1300), Total: $11,932.08, Rate: 9.24%
* (GU1) Government Unsubsidized
* (GS1) Government Subsidized 

Year 2

* (WF2) Wells Fargo Loan - Principal: $10,000, Outstanding Interest: $1,044.03, Total: $11,044.03, Rate: 8.74%
* (GU2) Government Unsubsidized
* (GS2) Government Subsidized

Year 3

* (GU3) Government Unsubsidized
* (GS3) Government Subsidized

Other Relevant Info:

* No other debt  
* Decent (and increasing) Credit Score: ~705 
* E-Fund with 2+ months expenses accounted for
* Great relationship with parents who provide financial support when its needed
* Pursuing BA degrees in Computer Science and Linguistics

My main question is what advice people have as to how to make monthly payments on my loans. Payments are not at all required at this point in time, I only have to start repaying them when I graduate (June, 2016).

My method thus far has just been to put extra money ($100/month or more from stipends) toward WF1 as it has had the highest Balance, and rate. As I have been making more payments recently, however, and will soon be able to make a payment of ~$1000 from an upcoming stipend, the Balance on WF1 is certainly approaching that of WF2. I wanted to ask if people have advice as to how to balance my upcoming loan payments - once the balance of WF1 is somewhat lower than that of WF2 should I split the payments in some way? I know that WF1 has a higher interest rate, but it is not necessarily by much.

Do I need to be more concerned about my government loans? I know that they have much smaller rates, and principal amounts.

I realize that these payments are minor scratches, but I want to get a jump start on repaying these loans before leaving school.

Any advice you might have is super appreciated!  Let me know if you have further questions/comments about my PF situation. Thanks!",finance,1425936493
investing,KRFT dividend discrepancy?,"I have some shares of KRFT, and on 12/23/14, it had a $0.55 dividend, which I can confirm based on a dividend I actually received. However, if you look at Yahoo! Finance's dividend history, it shows double the dividend for that date:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=KRFT&amp;a=08&amp;b=17&amp;c=2014&amp;d=00&amp;e=9&amp;f=2015&amp;g=v

Other sources show the correct dividend, ie:

http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/krft/dividend-history

You'll note the previous dividend in the Yahoo link is correct.


Since I'm the farthest thing from an experienced investor, I'm just wondering if this is a mistake, or if this actually makes sense given some circumstance that I'm not familiar with. It looks like errant data to me, and I can't imagine any valid reason why, but my ignorance is significant enough that I don't feel comfortable just assuming they goofed up somehow. :)


And if you're wondering why I'm obsessing over one single entry that I know the correct answer for: I was writing a little perl script to monitor/calculate where I'm at automatically, which uses yahoo finance as a backend, and noticed that my numbers for KRFT were wrong. If it's a mistake, I'll have to hardcode an entry for that one date (which would be lame). If there's some reason, I might be able to figure out a way to account for it programmatically and not find out my numbers are off when it happens again in the future. :-/",finance,1425941603

personalfinance,"(23/M) Just got a second credit card. Should I keep my old, secure credit card?","I've just gotten my first ""real"" credit card (Discover, $2500 limit) after having a secure TD card ($500 limit).  Part of the whole ""secure"" thing was that I had to put $500 of my own money into it as a backup in case I couldn't pay whatever I owed in time.  I had this card for nearly 2 years, making small purchases (gas, groceries, etc.) and would pay off my balance on average once every week or two.  I always paid the full amount owed.

My credit score of 711 is pretty good, I think.  I am just curious if it would benefit from having two credit cards now.  If so, should I split my purchases between the two?  I would really like to terminate my secure TD card so that I can get my $500 back, but if my credit will benefit from keeping it, I can get by without it.

Also, I have no idea if this is relevant or not but I am graduating college this May with appx. $60k in student loans (federal and private).  I am also moving out of my parents' house into an apartment, so within the next few months I am going to have a lot more payments thrown my way.

personalfinance,"Trying to get a mortgage. Large savings, but low income. Confused about FHA vs. Conventional. Now worried someone is trying to scam me","So. My situation is odd. I'm just afraid, you know. I work hard. I saved up a lot despite never truly having a great job. I just am worried these places are trying to take advantage of me. I'll try to explain everything:

My girlfriend and I make a combined income right now of $30,000 (I work part time, she's working while going to school). That will jump in the next 2 years when she's out of school, an I'm in line to be promoted to full time soon when an employee leaves. But for now, that is our income we will get the loan under.
But. I have $0 in debt. I've paid off all my school loans $20,000+. My girlfriend only has $8,000 left on a car. That's it.
I have a credit score of 770. She 725.
We have, minimum, $10,000 to put down on a condo, with our budget being top $90,000. We can stretch to do a 20% down payment if it will save us lots in the long run. I'm not afraid to go to 20% at all.

We originally called Quicken Loans. They never explained the difference in loans. After getting my information, they said I would easily get a $60,000 and my girlfriend could make up the difference. However, they put me on the path to a FHA loan without explaining the differences, and gave my number to realtor found in their program.

My in-house realtor immediately questioned why they are pushing me towards an FHA loan if I have such good credit and have so much in my savings for a down payment. He had me call another Mortgage Capital company. A realtor given to me by Quicken Loans is telling me not to use Quicken... does that seem right? Potential for a scam?

At first they discussed an IHDA loan for me - but, upon hearing that I plan on living in the condo ~5 years and want to put a large downpayment, said IHDA is not for me due to higher interest rates, penalties moving before 7 years, and other fees. I liked who I talked to. She used numbers and explained all 3 loan types to me, and is sending me an email that will calculate the differences between FHA and Conventional with my budget, downpayment, and plan.

Quicken Loan calls me literally 5 minutes after this discussion. Despite asking 3 times, they refuse to go in to detail about the differences. They keep saying ""yeah I guess we can look in to that"" basically. The Mortgage Capital company is stating very clearly that a conventional loan is for me. But. I'm concerned. A realtor provided by Quicken Loans trying to convince me not to use Quick Loans? Is a conventional loan truly better if I can do a 20% downpayment, have good credit, but very low income right now?

I'm sorry this is so long. I know not many will reply. I just am ignorant of this, you know. I'm trying to work hard, take care of my girlfriend while she goes to school, and we NEED to move out of Chicago to go near her school. I don't want to rent. We have the savings to make this work, and my job security is very comfortable despite the low pay, with a definite promotion. She'll have a job for sure out of school and has been offered one, we just need to tough out 2 years. Thanks for reading.",finance,1425944113

I had been selecting my loan repayment plans to be pretty steep (I want to be frugal and pay them off early). Well...I'm just looking at my wife's loans and her interest rates are all higher than mine. This seems like a basic question, but I want to ask it anyway.  
Note: As far as I know, I can make a payment at any time in any amount for all of our loans.  
Should I get my lower interest loans reduced down to the lowest monthly payment possible, then dump the majority of our budged loan money towards the highest interest loans one at a time? So, I would make ""minimum payments"" on the lowest interest loans while paying off the highest interest first.  
Is this a good plan? I understand the only downside would be if I didn't manage my money as well as I would be seeing more money in my checking account that I have to put towards the loans on my own instead of being required to pay that.  
Any insight?  
EDIT: Also, would it be crazy to go into forbearance on a low interest loan if it gave you time to pay back higher interest loans? Or is that just getting too technical? I guess that would be the extreme example.

personalfinance,Should I reduce my tax withholding to help pay down debt?,"Background: In 2014, my wife and I earned about $105,000. We file jointly, and at the beginning of the year decided we would have taxes withheld at the higher single rate. The result was a federal refund of about $4,000.

Here's my question: Should I temporarily reduce (or eliminate) my withholding and use the additional income to pay down our credit card debt? If I stopped having taxes withheld (but my wife continued) from my paychecks, I would bring in about $1,900 more per month. If I did that for, say, two and a half months, it would cover a good chunk of the $7,800 we have in debt. I realize it would cause my tax liability to go up, but it seems like it wouldn't go up so much that we'd owe much, if any, at the end of the year.

For their taxes each year they paid capital gains on stock portfolios held in my mom's name, in my dad's name, and a joint one held in both my name and my dad's so that he could manage it over the years.

Now we are on track to begin building credit, and in the meantime, we have both started using PRBC online to build an alternate line of credit, hoping that it might be usable for a FICO expansion score in the future for loans and possibly for our current credit card application, in case we are not approved.

I'm wondering if anyone has used or is using PRBC, and if so, have you had a good experience with them? Apparently their website is still in beta (how has it taken this many years for them to go online?!) and I am having a rough time getting my account going and reasonably useable.

My husband had no issue creating and verifying his account, but when I tried to create mine, it wouldn't accept it, saying that they could not verify my ssn. I realized that I had entered my birthday wrong, so I tried again and it still gave me the error on the ssn. After backing up my identity with tax documents, customer support seemed to indicate that it was a site error and that they would resolve it by the end of today. They still haven't fixed it, but I was able to get into my account somehow and add new personal information. However, if I try to go to my main page it pulls up the application window that discredits my ssn. At this point I'm worried about identity theft.

With that problem, along with the problems that go along with the site being in beta, I've been questioning the legitimacy of the company. They are, as best I can tell, federally recognized as a reporting agency, but man they aren't coming across that way. I'm hoping someone here can ease my worry and anxiety a bit about PRBC.

personalfinance,Opportunity cost of prudent investment (with respect to stress).,"The context:

I'm a 21 year old Australian, currently undertaking my masters degree in electrical and electronic engineering. My undergrad degree was double major bachelors in EE engineering and computer science. I've been working for four years at the high school I graduated from as a level 1/2 IT guy - I work 16 hours a week at the moment and earn just over $28 an hour. I also recently assumed control of the savings that my parents and grandparent have been keeping for me. This is a combination of birthday gifts and irregular cash deposits over the 18 years of my childhood which my grandmother was managing. The portfolio was almost entirely blue-chip stocks with dividends reinvestment schemes set up, though she also made the occasional day-trade and was successful in these efforts. I've consolidated these savings with the money that I'd been putting away throughout my short working life - I now have just over $50000. This is currently held in an online savings account with a 4% variable interest rate. I have no debts apart from HECS, which is no-interest and automatically paid off in your taxes when you reach an earning threshold.

The question revolves around the fact that those previously managing my money have encouraged me to pursue more lucrative investment options - things like managing a stock portfolio. I'm reluctant however because I feel as though this would not be worth the stress. Between work, uni and my personal life, I feel like I have very little left to give, and the emotional burden of watching a volatile market like the ASX move up and down doesn't seem like a reasonable price for the few extra percent on my investment return rate that I might be able to get, especially given that I expect a much higher earning power in the future, and even more so if my relationship continues to thrive (my girlfriend of almost 3 years is doing her postgrad in dentistry).

Is it worth it? My marks are hovering around the 70% point, which a professor at my uni has guaranteed to be insufficient for a top job. I'm working on pulling them up in the next couple of years, but stressing over investment now might have a negative impact on this effort, potentially resulting in a very real financial opportunity cost (in the form of lower potential starting salary), on top of the psychological one.

financialindependence,"University Student (Aus, 22) saving ~$3.5-4k monthly - am I making a big mistake in letting ~$50k sit in 3.2% savings account, rather than investing it?","After a promotion to a full time managerial position Monday-Friday and a weekend job on top of this, netting ~$1300 weekly pre-tax, I'm in a strong position to graduate uni in early April 2016 with a Goal Saver account through Comm Bank which should have a balance of around $80-90k (if everything continues to run as per usual).  (My workload is 75% of full-time student - and my degree requires very little effort on my part, hence the time to work 55hrs+ per week) My uni degree will result in a smallish pay rise at work ~10% and I'll probably continue to save around $40k per annum, based on $65-70k income - $18k tax/HECS debt and then $12k spend on top of this.  

I feel like I'm behind the 8-ball compared to other people in this sub when it comes to investments/market knowledge, but then again I'm perfectly fine with a 3.2% savings rate (I could get 4% with competitors).  I will (unfortunately) never be a high-income earner but I'm frugal and will continue to save lots and spend little, especially now I've moved back in with parents.  Am I missing the boat by not investing now, or is settling for a low-ish interest rate a reasonable start to set myself up for FI in the next 15 years?  

I live in Brisbane and house prices are completely absurd (think $600k in my area for a very modest house) so I don't feel as though investing in property is realistic given the interest I'd be copping on a home loan.  I know (I think) my parents use Vanguard for their retirement funds and they've never really dabbled in shares, so naturally they can't provide me with any sound advice. They also have ~$200k in the same 3.2% p.a. savings account type - which sounds pretty crazy to me, but I realise compared to families with comparable incomes, my parents have really missed out on early FI by letting savings sit in modest savings accounts without going any further.

With the small amount of money I have saved and at my age, is there really a great benefit in investing in index funds (I honestly have no idea what's what) or is 3.2% perfectly feasible to work with for the time being?  Also worth noting that whilst I may not feel the same in 10 years time, I absolutely love my job and I guess whilst I'm not racing towards ER, I'd like the option to retire comfortably if my feelings change before my late 30s.

Any advice/suggestions are most appreciated!

Edit: Thank-you for advice - over the next couple of weeks I'll be looking to move money ~$40k into a Vanguard Life Strategy Growth Fund, which carries a reasonable risk, but it's early days and I'm not looking for short-term growth.  Link to fund below!

I don't foresee any meaningful increases in pay anytime soon, I am unable to have get family to cosign (and no siblings to put in their name), and see no likelihood of getting lower future payments on loan.

Been lurking here for a while and would just like to reach out for some advice.  Long post so sorry but there is a lot to the situation. And I would like to provide as much  This is also my first ever post on reddit and I am using a throwaway for obvious reasons and would really like some help.  

I am the typical new college grad with a little over 35K in student debt.  I couldn't have gone to college without so no looking back now. 

I graduated last May with a degree in parks and rec management (I never expected it to be a high paying degree)and have been looking for job ever since graduating.  I have worked at least 2 part time jobs since graduating and gaining experience in the Recreation field.  Usually bring in on average $1100 after taxes with the jobs.   I want to work within the Public or Non profit sector of recreation.  (Looking for Public Service Loan Forgiveness) Been having a lot of interviews in Public recreation but I am passed over usually for someone with more experience (not butt hurt about it, it is what it is.) Looking to get my professional license (CPRP) but that is a $400 Exam and if you don't pass you don't get your money back. 

 During this time I put my student loans on the Income Based Repayment Plan. If/when I do get a job in Public service, this plan does qualify and would be able to have my loan amount forgiven after 10 years of service with making on time payments.  Making $0 payments does count because that is the number they set forth.   My payments are $0 but my loans are incurring interest.    Look at the loans and interest rates (Only have federal loans and all under IBR)
 
1) 828.47-  5.6% 
2) 3797.00 - 4.5%

Anyways, right now my parents take care of all of my bills (health insurance, gas, cell phone bill and any prescriptions). They couldn't  pay for anything during school and now they are in a better financial position so they help me out.   I only have to pay for rent($600-$650 depending on utility) , incidentals and food(I spend too much on food and its never an exact amount.  With the weddings coming up I have been limiting my eating out) I am in 3 weddings this years and those have been adding up quickly.  I do live with my boyfriend who has a good job so we leave closer to his work and my part time jobs.  We spend very little on gas but it makes up for it in rent. We do live in Raleigh in a nicer apartment complex.  We feel safe and comfortable where we live and we split the rent and utilities. 

 Right now I have been putting everything on a Citi card that gave me 0% through April 2016.  I have been paying it off each month usually paying about $1000.  It had been less but the weddings stuff, and job interview attire has been slapping me in the face here recently.  

My question is should I be making that ~$1000 payment to my loans until it gets closer to needing to pay the CC off (Has $5500 limit) or continue what I am doing until I get a job.  I was thinking of switching every month paying the $1000 to each until I find a full time job or until december when it would give me 3 months to pay off the CC before the 0% ends.

investing,"As the bull fades, what will YOU be doing?","Obviously, people's situations differ and change but I'd be open to hearing thoughts on my approach and what others are doing themselves.

- My 401k. 
Not changing a thing. It's mostly a retirement date fund (2050) with 30% in a SP500 index.

- My Roth. 
I've previously been aggressive and have 100% equities (all index funds). I'll be only buying bonds this year to swing it toward 30% bonds (the age in bonds guide).

- My brokerage
I have a few big baggers (TCX, LO) that I'll probably sell to lock in their gains, I don't see them getting much higher. The bulk of my money is in SPY (spotting a trend here?) and I'm planning to keep that until technicals are callling end of the bull run. Different people have different interpretations of that but I'd say a bounceless 2 month slow slide without FED intervention is my very rough guide. After that I'd selll 75%. Holding everything else that's in the red and/or has low P/E already (PFE, BLL, GBX, HCLP, KEP). Two I'll hold because I actually think they still have plenty more growth (ACAD, SAVE) but I'll sell to lock in the good gains if the situation changes.


- My reasoning.
I'm trying to balance my long term and short term interests. In the long term (ie retirement) I don't care about this bull run ending so that's why my 401k and Roth IRA will be pretty much unchanged with only the small change of adding some bonds to the ROTH to make it less equity heavy. I'm interested in buying my first home/apartment in the next 2-3 years and where I live that means dropping 100k (20% down on a average home price, fuck you gentrification). For that reason, I'm happy to lock in some of my gains to free up some cash that I'll need.

personalfinance,young &amp; married need advice with future planning &amp; student loans (with daddy issues),"Hi,

My wife and I are both 27 y/o and looking for some advice on our to better manage our money. Two years ago we were completely broke due to her being in grad school and me being self-employed not earning enough. We had no money in savings and barely enough to pay monthly expenses. 

Then we both got new full time jobs and we are making a lot more money (100k base combined). We read some Dave Ramsey and learned how to budget. We built up our savings from 0 to 13k in one year. We also began investing into a 401k and this year opened up a Roth IRA. Our goal that we've been saving for is to take a vacation to Europe this summer. We've been wanting to do this for 8 years, and we also want to start a family soon, so we think now is the best time for us to go. We live comfortably although we would like to be in a better position financially since we have $50k in student loans.

Here's a breakdown of our financial state.

**The good**

* Both good credit scores well over 700

* No credit card debt, but we use a card and pay the balance to build points

* $5,200 in take home pay per month after health insurance &amp; 401k

* $6,000 in checking account

* $13,000 in savings account

* $3,500 in 401k

* Just opened Roth IRA - adding $300/mo


**The bad**

* I have $6,322 in student loans

* She has combined $44,500 in student loans

* We are leasing 2 cars and renting an apt


**Our monthly budget looks like this:**

* $520 tithe

* $1,300 Rent

* $1250-1,500 credit card payment on average. We use it for gas/groceries/food/misc spending (food is the killer and we are trying to cut this number down by not eating out this month)

* $434 car payments

* $180 car insurance

* $160 electric

* $157 phones

* $72 cable/internet

* $70 my student loan payment

* $246 her student loan payment

* $300 Roth IRA

* We are usually left with some money $500-$1000 and we deposit this into our savings.

**Loans**

* 8,430 6.55%

* 11,837 6.55%

* 24,306 7.9% - deferred

* 6,322 4.25%

I entered the student loans  into unbury.us and it freaked me out because the biggest loan will take a very long time to pay off and will generate a lot of interest. Currently it is deferred because she took some extra classes last year, so we aren't making any payments on it. I want to figure out how to deal with this.

My wife is a social worker so I know about the 10 year forgiveness plans, but actually right now she works at a for-profit charter school so she can't apply.

There is one more piece to this puzzle. Her dad made an agreement with her, before she went to grad school and before I married her, that he would pay for her grad school. When it came time go, he said he didn't have the cash flow, so she should take out loans and he would repay them.

Basically what happened is he didn't pay them back. And her thinking it was not her responsibility, she didn't make any payments and they have grown. He's been stringing her along for a couple years... continually pushing the pay date into unknown future and making excuses and forgetting about the agreement. We don't know why he won't pay but it is not because he is not able to.

She is still under the impression that she will convince him to pay the debt. It's somewhat concerning because she wants to take a vacation, start having kids and save for the future, and she feels cheated because our hard earned money will have to go toward paying loans that we did not agree to take on. I am taking a realistic approach that he may not and we will have to deal with it and move on with our lives the best we can. I've been taking on extra freelance jobs and also looking at applying to jobs with higher salaries. If it were only up to me, I would take a large part of our savings and immediately pay off my loan and parts of hers.

**TLDR My question is how can we best pay down the student loans while at the same time building up savings &amp; investments AND planning for kids**


Edit: added loan interest rates

Edit: People are saying I should not tithe or should put it toward the debt. We gave 10% when we were broke, we will give 10% (probably more) when we are wealthy. We also volunteer on top of this so I'm not sure if volunteering in place of it is a good justification for not tithing. It's not something we do when it's convenient for us. It means we put God first before everything else and we keep 90% of the blessings! I'm not trying to sound stubborn, but if there's an area where I need to redistribute the money the tithe is probably not where I want to look.

Edit: The tithe is completely voluntary to our local church. The tithe is not going to make or break us and I think by focusing on that as the sole cause of my financial debt is just distracting me from tackling the real problems (spending too much on luxuries). If the tithe was my problem, I wouldn't be doing it. I know it seems counter-intuitive to people who aren't Christians, but this act of faith gives us huge intangible benefits and does way more for our financial health than the 10% we would be spending on ourselves or putting toward debt. The only good criticism I've read is that we went from broke college mode to consumer spending mode, and that's what we need to look at reducing. Although I would keep in mind we made a lot of financial decisions while under the promise the loan wouldn't be ours to deal with... and now it is... so obviously the budget needs to adjust now.",finance,1426004165

I graduated debt free and never had to take out a student loan, so I'm kind of ignorant on the matter. My fiance and I are getting married in June and I'm trying to tackle exactly the best way to go about paying her student loans (I'm the financial one in the relationship, handling budgeting and such). Currently she has two loans: one with a balance of $24,243.01 and one with a balance of $14,988.88. Both have an interest rate of 6.125%. Where this confuses me is that she recently attempted to change something (I think she filed for forebearance?) and her understanding is that she gets to make interest free payments for one year towards one of the loans (she's unsure which one). Is that a real thing? Seems to good to be true to me. Anyways, assuming that this is the case, would it be smarter to make minimum payments to the interest free loan and paying extra on the one with interest or vice versa? Our combined income will be around $90,000, so roughly $60,000 after taxes. I planned on putting between $1,000-$1,500 each month toward debt (those two loans and her car payment).

I recently paid off all my student loans and now I am ready to tackle this debt as well. Anyhow, I am no longer working for that company and about to start a new job in a profession I enjoy.

$72 Misc (Extra gas, travel, eating out, oil change, car maintenance)    
No rent paid because of job    

Total $900

$19895 Car Loan @ 0.9% and 45 monthly payments left    

**Savings**    
$3000 Emergency Fund    
$400 per month

I am eventually looking to sell my current car (not underwater, comparable cars are valued around $22K, my extended warranty should be able to get it to $23K if I sell now).    

Ok now the questions:    

1. As I can currently afford to pay my car payments and I do like my car, should I keep it around for a few more years till I can get to the point where the car is worth about $12K more than the loan then sell car and buy $12K car? This would spread the 'hurt' from off the lot depreciation over more time.    
2. Sell car now, take out new loan (probably at higher rate). Use $3K made on car as down payment?    

Anything I'm missing? Any advice is much appreciated!

personalfinance,A question about ROTH IRA's and current interest rates.,"Hiya, so I've been lurking for a long time but I know enough to know that I know nothing, so I normally don't comment or ""vote"" on anything.
My question is this:  Yesterday I opened up a Roth IRA with my bank, a credit union I've been a member of all my life.  I am a full time student, very early 20's but I also own a small consulting company and a few lucrative websites.  This has allowed me to lead a debt-free life despite my full time student expenses, and I have decided that rather than spending my extra money on things I enjoy and travel, it stands to reason that I should be investing as soon as I am able, which I believe is now.  

So with that background out of the way, everybody on here seems to have a Roth IRA, and I get that tax free withdrawals are a good thing in the long run, but when I saw the interest rate offered by my bank, it was atrocious, at just under 1%.  I made the deposit necessary to open the account, but I also trade stocks through Robinhood where my consulting knowledge has allowed me to earn a significantly higher return.  

So this subreddit and many financial advisors all claim that the Roth should be my first step, but all I see is a chunk of assets that I can't use for stocks.  What would you do in my position?  Should I continue to maximize out the Roth year after year, blindly hopeful that the rates will get better?

personalfinance,How should I structure my first car loan?,"I'm trying to buy a new car and I'm learning how to finance the purchase.

I have the cash to buy the car on the spot, but I'd like to get some sort of loan in order to build my credit.

Here's the deal they gave me, which I didn't take: http://i.imgur.com/Dn7Y1Ba.jpg

As you can see the interest rate is horrible because I've never had a loan before in my life and I only have a $3K credit card (I'm 24).

How should I structure this loan to build my credit up the best? Does it matter how much I put down vs finance, or should I be shooting for a smaller loan? Does the term matter or is it only the size of the loan?

Also, I kept telling the guy that I didn't want a 60 month term, but he kept saying that if I wanted to, I could just pay it off faster and it will be the same. However, I read on another site that some of these loans could be frontend loaded and that there is more interest on the front part of the loan than on the back, and so paying early is not as effective.

Is there anything else here that is fishy or that I should be thinking about?

personalfinance,"[Update, still need help] Parents cutting me off - need to pay for tuition in the fall. What do I need to do NOW? They won't cosign.","Hi, 

A few people commented on my last thread and I am still searching for advice.

Here is the old thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2y5qei/parents_cutting_me_off_need_to_pay_for_tuition_in/


So I met with my financial aid office and I am guaranteed 7.5k in federal loans, as all students are (independent of how much money your parents make per unsubsidized stafford loan). However, tuition at my in-state school is ~18k a year. 

I told my parents and asked them to fill out the FAFSA and they are refusing because A) It takes too much time and B) they think I will get no money and C) because they don't want to give up their personal information. Apparently I don't need them to fill out the FAFSA to get the 7.5k but I will need to check on that.

I informed them that this is what most people do and that all the data is safe. They don't care. They are continually calling me a liar and an awful son. It's annoying.

So, at this point, I really don't have much other options. As I said in the previous post, here are my current finances

~8k in savings


making ~6k this summer


making ~500 a month with a part time job  (could add another)


room and board is ~ 700 (I have a room mate)


food is ~ 150-180 a month

7.5k won't really cut it unless I pick up another job. I am considering doing a coop during the fall/winter semester because (I can probably) graduate a semester early and can afford to take a semester off to work. Since I am in computer science, a coop could probably net me another ~10k.

There are obviously also scholarships I could apply for.

I'm just wondering how in trouble I am. Could I survive with the 7.5k and no cosigner?

TL;DR Update. Met with FA office. I can get 7.5k in loans without my parents help but they still refuse to fill out the fafsa for more aid.  Tuition is still ~19k a year. I don't know how screwed I am.",finance,1426015936

personalfinance,Do I need additional withholding if I'm taking a pay cut midyear to account for the higher bracket?,"Hi all.  I'm an attorney who recently moved from a large corporate firm to a smaller more specialized firm as a long-term career move (and a lifestyle move, as my hours were... difficult, to say the least).  I'm blessed to be making a nice income even now, and to have my student loans finally paid off, but I'm taking a very deep pay cut.  Complicating matters is the fact that just before leaving I received a substantial bonus.  The numbers are as follows:

I was making $230,000 a year ($19,166 per month) for January and February.  State and federal income taxes were withheld.

I received a $65,000 bonus on February 6 from which state and federal income taxes were withheld.

I am now earning $135,000 a year or $11,250 per month.

Needless to say, tax isn't my specialty.  But it occurs to me that the bonus pushes me into a higher tax bracket than my monthly income would suggest.  How do I account for this in setting up the withholding at my new job?  In other words, do I need to withhold additional money for the last few months of the year to account for the fact that I'm in a higher bracket?  Or will the withholding that was done on my earlier, higher income somehow equalize the numbers?  (This is all on the assumption that I'd rather pay the tax check by check to avoid an end-of-year tax liability.)  In other words, won't they continue to withhold taxes only at the 135k bracket even though I'm really going to be in the 200+ bracket by the end of the year?

Insert an obligatory joke about how lawyers can't do math.

Last year doing my taxes, I noticed that the federal withholdings on my wife's w-2 was empty.  My wife had only been employed there for the last 3 months of 2013.  We had filed all the proper paperwork with them, and they admitted it was their fault, they missed entering it in the system.  Fucked up our refund for 2013.

My wife spent 3 weeks fighting with the payroll company to get the issue corrected.  She's told it's all good, so my wife tells me it's all good, and I take her word for it.  She's got electronic pay stubs and I've never had access to see them.  She never checks them (Admittedly her/my fuck up).

Open the W-2 today.  0 federal withholdings.

I saw the correspondence with her HR staff saying that they needed to fix this and it was wrong from last year.  I'm going in to pull emails as soon as I can log into her email.

If the employer stated that it has been corrected and they didn't fix it, am I able to seek recourse?  I understand that the taxes go to the IRS, and they are owed no matter what.  What I'm pissed about is her employer is legally required to withhold the taxes as she specified and failed to do so.  Now I have to come out of pocket and pay all at once.

I'm in graduate school for Engineering-all my school is paid for + $1000 a month stipend.

We have saved up about $6,000 and will be able to add another $5,000 this summer (I have a summer internship lined up). The houses that we are looking at are in the $200-250k area, which means to avoid PMI for the life of the loan, we need to save up ~$50k. 

I will be making roughly $65k out of school, with a baby and my wife staying home (we think it's important for her to stay at home), it might take us a while to reach that ~$50k mark.

College / Career

I was kicked out of college, because during my enrollment there I experience a psychotic breakdown. During my first semester in college I did excellent, but after that depression and psychosis made my gpa go from a near perfect 4.00 to a 2.15. This last semester was the worst, because I failed all my classes.My low gpa made me lose my scholarship and  federal aid (payed around 95% of my tuition). I have been talking to my advisor and she thinks I can appeal my case and regain my scholarship and aid. My major was in CS, but if I go back I might change it to civil engineering (preferably environmental engineering). I want to change my major because I want to get a job as a water treatment operator. Right now, I am currently studying to take the state certification exam. I know I don't need a degree to be a water treatment operator, but with the degree I can advance faster up the ranks (can take the higher level tests faster). The problem with this option is that I have to either stop completely working (if i get the water treatment job 12 hour shifts) or stay at my job (3rd shift) longer and hope for a promotion (6 month wait -may/june) for better hours. 

My second option is to transfer to WGU online school and knock out an accounting degree within an year and start working as an accountant. Doing the online school allows me to keep working my job full time. The kicker is I am going to have to fork over cash to pay for my tuition,which sets me a few months back in paying my credit card. After I get the degree I will look for an accounting job, preferably one with my current company.  

I picked those two careers because of stability and career advancement. Also, I know these two career options seem completely different from each other, but my main goal in life is to become a successful screenwriter (long shot).

personalfinance,Recently married and want to plan for our future,"Wife and I got married recently. We share all finances and are happy with that decision still several months in. Seems to not be as popular these days but it works for us. We want to plan for the future, but aren't particularly financially savvy, though we are responsible and have good credit. She recently finished grad school and is working full time. We have health insurance through her employer. I'm still in grad school, but essentially debt free thanks to a fully funded program, for which I'm incredibly grateful. For a current grad student and a recent grad school graduate, I think we're in decent shape, but we want to maximize where we put and save our money to help us achieve long term goals. We have no problem making rent, paying all of our bills, living financially consciously but comfortably. No debt other than the student loans (most of which will be forgiven, see below) and auto loan (0% APR).

Financial related goals/needs:

* buy a house (2-3 years from now)

* buy a new car in the next 1-3 years (we bought one end of last year, but our other car is 18 years old - runs great now, but y'know)

* save for retirement

Current financial picture below:
Savings account: $15k

Wife income after taxes, health insurance, other deductions: $1805 every 2 weeks

My grad stipend income: $780 twice per month 

Debts:
Her student loans balance (aggregated): $111,300
 
* All but a $10,000 private loan will be canceled/forgiven thanks to her profession of helping people. We have structured payment plans on the forgiveable loans to be as low as possible, or put eligible loans into cancellation deferment until their cancellation dates. Loans have not been consolidated because this would negatively affect the amount that would later be eligible for forgiveness.

My student loans balance (from undergrad): $2100, currently in deferment, super low interest rate.

We stash away $1300/month into our savings account. We are probably going to increase this to $1500/month. What should we do with this? Keep it in our standard savings account? A CD? High yield savings? Our biggest goal for these funds is to have a decent down payment on a house in 2-3 years but not drain our savings when we do so.

She has a 401K with employer matching up to 4% pre-tax. Unsure what to do here and how much to contribute as it's a toss up if we'll be in the area long enough for her to be vested in the plan to get the full amount of employer matching.

Other things to consider: in 2-3 years, I'll be on the job market and it's somewhat likely that we'll be moving out of state. No telling right now what I'll be making later on, but we would potentially like to buy a house when we move at that point - but we don't know where that will be.

Ultimately, I'd just like to hear thoughts and advice on what to do with the money we save, potentially how much and where to save for retirement at this point, how to meet those goals mentioned above. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks!",finance,1426037271

personalfinance,Graduating college in December and want to follow my long-term boyfriend to the DC area. What should I be doing now to be financially ready?,"I am graduating from college with a degree in electrical engineering in December (yay!). My boyfriend of 5.5 years has accepted a job right outside of DC staring in a month or two (in Maryland, but within walking distance of a metro station) and will be moving soon. Relationship wise he's perfect husband material (we love each other, both very responsible with money, respectfully discuss things instead of argue, etc.) and we want to live together before taking the plunge. My plan right now is to try to find a job in that area and move up from Atlanta when I graduate. 


I have an internship that pays $20/hr (40 hrs a week) during the summer and research at $10/hr (20 hrs/week) during the school year. I also work for a babysitting agency once or twice a month (usually gigs where the kid is asleep most of the time so I can get paid to sit and study) and after taking out contractor taxes earn $100/ month. I am completely independent from my parents (I helped them get back on their feet). My monthly expenses are as follows:


* Rent: $375 (lease up in December)
* Utilities (my part of it): $120
* Car payment: $328 on a Nissan Versa (45 months left and 13.99% interest, no cosigner. Yes I know that was stupid of me. I was expecting to graduate a year sooner and pay it off immediately with my job) I owe about $11k on it
* Car Insurance: $118
* Health Insurance: $24 (obamacare)
* Phone: $40
* Gas: $100
* Visa: $96 ($4,099 left at 15.55%, debt from when I was giving my parents cash and used my credit to make it work. Paying it down now.)
* Discover: $40 ($1,700 at 18.99%, textbooks and suits for interviews)
* Kohls and Amazon cards: $0 (payed off, both at 22% interest)
* Food/misc: $250 (bad take-out habit; started cooking crockpot meals at home) 
* Student Loans: $50 ($1367 including interest, federal subsidized, not concerned in the slightest until after graduation)


My internship want to hire me in Atlanta and according to Glassdoor I can expect to make $55-$60k a year. They have an office in the DC area, but they don't have a branch of my department (to my knowledge) working out of that office. My backup plan is to stay here and pay things off and visit every other weekend (with flights booked well in advance for $200 airfare) every other weekend. I have 9 months to decide/prepare. I know that DC is crazy expensive and that I might have to sublet for a few months until his lease/ room mate arrangement runs out. I expect to make $80k in that area. What can/should I do to prepare myself for the next chapter in my life?

I made a comment a few days ago about the Goldman Sachs report on young people not having any money. This article is relevant for investors as well as students (probably a big part of the reddit investing subreddit) though because at over a trillion dollars, student loans have surpassed all other forms of consumer debt in the United States.

On the one hand this might allow struggling students to unburden themselves of these massive debts and get on with their lives.
On the other I have no idea what this will do to the economy, the Federal government might have to take on a whole ton of bad loans again.

There are about 85 billion in delinquent student loan payments but this is just missed payments, not the total value of the bad loans to this point.",finance,1426041030
personalfinance,State Retirement not vested - money returned but now taxed. What next?,"So I'm in a somewhat weird situation. I worked for a state for 4.8 years before moving away, contributing some mandatory money to the state retirement fund. 5 years is when vestment happens. So now, many years later, I've hit the mandatory lack of contribution where they return the unvested retirement money (plus interest) to me, but it gets hit with state and federal taxes. 

I've got about $8k coming to me. 

My financial situation: About to marry another 30-something professional, both of us making pretty decent money. We're grossing about $115k together, paying off a $80k condo mortgage at 4% interest, $25k in 6% interest student loans for her, $10k in 3% student loans for me. 

She's many years younger, and just starting out professionally after graduate school. She's putting a pile away in retirement, because her company (financial institution) does some ridiculous matching. My retirement fund is shit. Went back to school a couple of times, and this $8k is about 50% of my total, in my late 30s. 

Because it's now been taxed, I'm a bit hesitant to just toss this money back into an IRA. I've got another state job and I'm pouring piles into retirement now, but I've got a ~10 year deficit to make up. 

We've also got a 9 year old car and an 18 year old furnace. 

That $8k plus the trade-in on the current car would get us 50% of the way to a new car. 

That $8k would pay for a new furnace. 

That $8k would wipe out most of my student loans. If I wanted to scrape every last penny together, I could kill it. $200/month back in my pocket. 

It would also knock 30% out of her student loan at 6% interest. 

And it's 10% of our mortgage at 4% interest. 

I could toss it into a Roth IRA, or buy some sweet, sweet Etsy stock with it. 

I really don't know what the best use of it would be. Pre-tax, it's easier. Post-tax, it's a bit harder. Do I follow the common wisdom of killing off the highest interest debt first? That's a hard choice when I know there are two major unreliable pieces of expensive hardware in my life. Hard to budget for that. Killing a debt entirely is tempting, due to the guarantee of money back in my pocket. But none of those helps me get closer to a functional retirement fund.",finance,1426042619
personalfinance,Trying to maximize Teacher Loan Forgiveness,"My boyfriend has two federal student loans - about $3,000 at 5.6% and $7,000 at 6.45%. He qualifies for teacher loan forgiveness in which up to $5,000 in student loans are forgiven after teaching for five years. Obviously, he'd like to take advantage of this to the max possible.

He is still in his first year of teaching. He has four more years of teaching to qualify for forgiveness. Problem is, he will pretty much finish paying of his student loans in four years, even if he pays the minimum monthly.

Teachers who qualify for forgiveness may enter forbearance for one year. If I'm calculating correctly, that would leave him with about $2,000 left in four years (edit: Perhaps more like $3,500? What's the best way to calculate this?)

Is there anything he can do to more fully take advantage of the forgiveness program? He makes $42,000 a year, so I'm not sure if income based repayment would reduce his minimum payment any further.

This has prevented me from going solar for the past few years.

However we just had our rear patio extended and re-roofed including replacing any wood that had issues, and the slope is very flat.

I am considering having some racking installed on the patio roof and then installing the panels myself in small bursts using either Micro or several Strings to keep my initial Capital outlay under control, and lessen the chance of a bad batch type of issue.

Anyone see any issues with this approach?

Would you angle your racking towards the Sun slightly? (Southern California)   
Or am I asking for trouble when the wind picks up?

Being this is patio and not residence roofing, and nowhere near the apex, anyone know if I still need to worry about the CA 3 foot clearance rule?

technology,Europe’s Net Neutrality Sense. Its Internet could soon be more competitive than America’s.,"You know Washington is on the wrong track with a regulation when even Brussels has a better idea. Witness the latest net-neutrality proposal from European Union leaders, which is smarter than the 300-page blobfish recently imposed by President Obama’s Federal Communications Commission.

In response to demands from the European Parliament for net-neutrality regulations, EU member governments are discussing a Latvian plan that would leave the marketplace scope to set rates for different types of data transmission. While the proposal from the governments would require Internet-service providers “to equally treat equivalent types of traffic when providing internet access services”—a big nod to proponents of net neutrality—it would also allow providers to enter into agreements with content companies to ensure a specific level of service quality.

This isn’t a full-throated commitment to letting market forces work on the European Internet. It would be better if the EU weren’t imposing any new rules on the telecommunications industry. Nevertheless, the provision opens the door to differential pricing, the bane of the net-neutrality crowd but potentially an important market tool for stimulating future investment.

It’s also a major improvement on what the FCC did last month when it applied early-20th-century utility rules to the Internet. The key insight in Europe is that there needs to be some market involvement in pricing. The European proposal also waters down a plan to further limit the roaming charges mobile operators charge customers using services outside their home countries. Roaming already is subject to Brussels-imposed price caps, and the European Parliament and Commission are agitating to ban roaming charges.

Any final regulation will need to survive the European Parliament, where support for activist regulation is stronger. What Europe really needs to boost investment and pro-consumer competition would be a single market for telecommunications services, coupled with more reasonable antitrust enforcement to allow the consolidation Europe’s telecom market so sorely lacks.

Still, this climb down on net neutrality raises the prospect that the EU could end up with a more pro-investment business climate than the U.S. Not everyone wants to follow Washington’s lead in tightening government’s grip on the Internet.

personalfinance,Advice on apartment hunting in NYC with not-so-great credit and limited resources,"Hi reddit! This is my first post, and I am reaching out because I feel like I've exhausted all other resources. You seem like a very smart, helpful bunch, and I'd love to hear what advice you have for me on this subject. Please bear with me, I can be quite verbose :)

A little bit about me: I am a 28-year old single mom with a 6-year old daughter. Moved to NYC for grad school about a year ago. Couch-surfed with friends for a few months while I looked for apartments, but as you might imagine, this is not ideal with a child in tow. Because of bad credit (current score: 582, but was lower at the time) and no steady income besides student loans, I was not approved for the apartments I applied for. I ended up in an illegal sublet in one of the more dangerous NYCHA projects in the city. I had to move out in December because the original tenant wanted to move back in. 

I was lucky (and hopefully also qualified!) enough to get a full-time job that I very much enjoy beginning in January of this year. I make about $40,000. I was also lucky enough to have a friend here who was kind enough to let me and my daughter stay with him while I got settled in my job and looked for an apartment. Unfortunately, he had previously arranged for some of his family to come visit beginning next week, so I need to be out by then. 

For anyone familiar with NYC renting requirements, it is INSANE. You have to make 40X the monthly rent annually, and you generally have to have a good credit score. If you use a guarantor, the need to make 80X the monthly rent annually! Between my job ($40K) and my student loans (~20K), I can show income of about $60000 (not sure how landlords feel about loan income though). I am therefore looking for apartments in the range of 1250-1350 max. Obviously, if I could find something lower, it would be ideal. Because of my daughter, I am looking for a 1-bedroom. At her age, a studio just isn't feasible for us anymore. 

I have found a few (albeit a very limited number) of options in this price range in the area in which I would like to live. However, I am worried that I will not be approved for these apartments based on my credit score, and possibly the fact that without my loans, my income does not meet guidelines. I also do not have a guarantor who makes 80X the monthly rent. I know there must be other people in this city with less-than-stellar credit and modest incomes. How are they able to rent? 

There is also the issue of brokers and their outrageous fees (12-15% of the annual rent). As I am only recently getting back on my feet financially, I don't have any savings. I cannot really afford to pay such a large sum of money to a broker for basically unlocking a door and showing me an apartment and passing paperwork on to a landlord. It seems crazy to me that this is even a thing. So any ideas on how to avoid this would also be appreciated. 

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: Single mom with bad credit and modest but stable income is having a hard time finding an apartment in NYC. Help! :)

Edit: For those of you advising me that I won't be able to afford to live in most areas of Manhattan- I am well aware :) I am not trying to live in some doorman building in midtown or anything. My daughter's school is in Washington Heights and my work is in Harlem, so I am looking at both of those areas and in between, which coincidentally is where the most affordable housing in Manhattan is located, so that works out for me. I am willing to look elsewhere, but in addition to higher commuting costs, I also have to consider that there would be higher childcare costs as well, since I would need to pay for care during the additional time that I am traveling home from work. 

I appreciate all the advice so far, but I guess I want to clarify that I am not having particular trouble actually finding places in my desired area within my desired budget. The issue that I would like help with is how to improve chances of being approved. For example, is it worth it to explain my personal situation to owners? The advice about Insurent was very helpful, I have already been approved for a Lease Guaranty with them. It's just a matter of deciding if the crazy fees would be worth it.

Instead, it'd be better to  do a series of overalpping swaps, so one 5-year swap, one 10-year swap, one 15-year swap, one 20-year swap, and one 25-year swap. How does this minimize my risk?  An amortizing swap is not an option.

Furthermore, how would having swaps in opposite directions be beneficial? I.e. having some of the swaps be me paying out a fixed rate on the agreed principle, and others me paying a variable rate on the agreed principle. What possible benefit would cancelling out portions of the swaps with eachother have? I don't have to completely negate the risk, just minimize it as best as possible.

personalfinance,Owe $95k on a $68k property. Want to move closer to work. Here's my plan.,"So, I was one of those crushed by the housing crash in 2008. I bought a $150k condo for $115k (I'm a genius!) only to see it valued at about $68k now.

I was 22 when I bought it, and thanks to my parents helping me build credit early in life I got close to the best rate available at that time (6.75%; the best was 6.48%; remember those days?!). Unfortunately, though, the loan didn't qualify for FHA status (since the condo complex was viewed as a likely target for investment properties).

* I owe $95k, value is $51k for tax purposes, $71k according to Zillow, $68k according to last sale.
* I have $21k in easily accessible assets ($16k in investments with a net gain, and $3k in investments with a net loss, plus cash on hand)
* Mortgage is $682 (plus some taxes); interest rate is 6.75%
* My Transunion score is 783 (as of 3/5/15), Equifax is 764 (estimated).

If I pay down my mortgage with my investments I can get within 10% of the value of my place; that means I could qualify to refinance at current rates. If my credit is good enough, I should be able to get ~4.5%. If I just do another 30 years (I'm the president of the condo board and we're about to do a full envelope replacement on all units), **my payment drops to $364.** With the current condo fee, taxes, and that payment, **I could rent out my condo at the current going rate of $950/month with a $240 surplus to offset the riskiness of renting.**

Additionally, I spend about $400/month (at current costs) to commute to work each month (100 miles total each day). I could then rent a place much closer to work and significantly reduce this cost (call it a 50% reduction).

Yes, I deplete my savings, but surely this is a good reason to do so. I have a stable career as a senior engineer with a publicly traded company and I don't plan to switch companies any time soon.

""Auto Binary Signals Review""

What's Auto Binary Signals

Software that chooses stock trades for you using binary options.Ugh, I'm not certain I can stand any more of these products this month. Binary options are defined in vogue, but I have still to meet ANYONE that has got decent money with them. This is high risk, stock trading, and you need deep pockets to take part.
Auto Binary Signals

There is no such thing as software that can help you get these trades, then stay away from any merchandise (like Auto Binary Signals) that says it's easy to turn a millionaire in this direction.

Beware of whatever merchandise that says there's nothing to learn and everything is managed mechanically

Auto Binary Signals use the typical ""Fight The Man"" strategy and tells us about how everyone is losing their occupations, the stock markets are rigged, and the economic system is in the dumps.

It's standard rhetoric that is simply meant to make you nervous about the future and draw you to buy his junk. By the way, Roger Pierce is not a genuine person. Google ""Roger Pierce binary options"". Here are your results (none of them are linked to him, they are just reviews of Auto Binary Signals)

But if you Google ""Nathaniell Brenes affiliate marketing"" (this is what I do for a living), and you can discover that ALL of the results are me, my social profiles, my guest blogging, and other stuff I make out. It's because I'm a literal person, you can actually let the cat out of the bag to me, and I stand by my word.


[&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CLICK HERE Auto Binary Signals &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;](http://tinyurl.com/q7m2efx)


In other language, you will be able to use the AutoBinarySignals software forever after you have purchased the $97 members-only access. No subscriptions, no recurring payments and no commissions of whatever form will be charged ever in the future.

Similarly, you can anytime within a period of 60 days request a refund if for some reason you don't like the services furnished. The money back guarantee is unconditional, meaning that you can call for a refund without having to excuse why. You take your money back without questions.

Grounded on the above, we truly believe that AutoBinarySignals is a really amazing product out there. We are particularly moved by the fact that the company does not require dealers to make continuous payments. You only pay once and have lifetime access.

Also, rarely causes a signal service to achieve a winning rate of 80%-100%. Appended with the fact that you can anytime get your money back within 60 days after purchasing the service we believe that traders should definitely try this signal trading provider out.

How will Auto Binary Signals work

We don't cognize about you, but we're getting somewhat fed up with all the 'multi-millionaire' traders who say they've keyed out a virtually foolproof way of earning money trading in their respective marketplaces.

Have A look: http://goo.gl/FqDpQ3

Hence when we came across Auto Binary Signals, the latest offering from Roger Pierce, that is a piece of software he says caused him his millions by the age of 49, we heaved a cynical sigh of 'seen that also many times before…'

But never let it be stated that we don't give a product a real prospect to create an imprint on us. Cue an in-depth look at this latest product to reach the marketplace, and we take a journey into whether this is yet another scam piece of software that doesn't play, or if it truly is worth spending your hard earned cash on.

And what we discovered certainly makes for interesting reading…

What do you actually get for your money?

Ok, so Mr. Pierce says that 'the key to fiscal success is the timing.' And what his Auto Binary Signals software gives you is the following:

** Equilibrium and stability: as important in binary trading as they are in life. The software is being as marketed as being super accurate – with 80-100% leading signals.

** Risk/Reward stabilizing system: that alerts you with automatic signals that alert you when to trade binary, and more importantly, when not to swap.

**Supply/Demand price predictor: that does exactly as its name indicates, and predicts when the supply and demand will move up, down or stay equal

** Auto Adaptive Profit-Trade technology: because the markets adapt almost on an hourly basis, so it's 100% necessary that the software will also adapt.

** Four indicators aligning: mean that the software only delivers signals when the four vital indicators have aligned together. This means that you then get the highly accurate 80-100% signal, and an extremely high confidence rate.

** 5 built in indicators: that are responsible for the analysis if the market. The software contains cohesive recognition patterns that trigger whether or not the danger is low enough to get a deal.

** Proprietary MPMIS: a custom built multi indicator system that gives super accurate trading precision.
Auto Binary Signals

The Pros

** One of the best things about Auto Binary Signals, is that it's compatible with every individual type of binary option trading programs – something that many of its competitors fail to admit.

** You don't necessitate to be a computer genius kid to use the plan. Because it receives an enhanced visual interface, it doesn't matter how technical you might be, it's easy to apply whatever your degree of expertise.

**A built in secret strategy (written by Roger himself), calculates not only the trade confidence, but the intensity and the likelihood of the signal being a successful business deal.

** You are also given the freedom to decide whether to trade digital options (of 15 minutes and above) or to go with the turbo options (that run in the region of 1-5 mminutes)

[&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Watch Live Video Here &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;](http://youtu.be/TisKo7Et4so)



The Cons

** Probably the biggest so called 'con,' is allowing yourself to trust in a computer program to make your trading decisions for you. But when you begin to see the advantages of allowing the software to give you your signals (instead of spending hours trawling manually through all the information), it doesn't take long for the savvy trader to understand quite what a useful trading tool Auto Binary Signals really is.


The Bottom Line

Considerably, we have to accept that whilst we don't like being turned out wrong, Auto Binary Signals have certainly done just that. And while we would never propose that you should have a computer make every single decision for you, using this strategic piece of software as a tool within your trading efforts is surely something that can increase your prospects of sustained profitability by a vast quantity.

Have A look: http://goo.gl/FqDpQ3

antMr. Pierce certainly knows his stuff, and Auto Binary Signals are definite proof of this. And when you add in the fact that this little baby comes with a 60 day, no-qublibe, 100% money back guaree if you're not completely satisfied, it makes trying it out a bit of a no-brainer, in our humble opinion. In a nutshell, we highly recommend Auto Binary Signals – if not for all your binary trades, then to yield you a heads up on what you should be looking for in each and every deal you decide to invest…

personalfinance,Got $4000 in CC debt right now. Going to end up paying approximately $8000 in taxes next month. I've got about $4000 saved for those taxes. Should I pay off the CC right now instead?,"So let me lay out the facts and my plan/options maybe you guys can give me a little advice.

1) I didn't save money out of every paycheck all year like I wanted to for taxes.  Or rather, I did but then I dipped into that account over and over.  Now April is coming up and I'm frantically saving to pay what I owe, which will be about $7000 in federal and probably around $1000-$1500 for state.

2) I have about $4000 saved right now in that tax account.  I add to it $1000 every two weeks usually, but for the next month it will be $1500 so it will be about $7000 when tax day rolls around.

3) I currently am floating about $4000 in CC debt.  I pay the payments, I pay the finance charges, but I'm paying off very little of the principal each month because I'm trying to save for taxes.

My thought on this is that I should use the money that I have saved for taxes to pay my CC bill off.  Then, when next month rolls around, I charge my taxes to my CC.  Then I use my decent credit score (780) to apply for something like a Chase Slate that has no balance transfers or interest for 18 months.

Then I can budget in an amount every month to pay down on that new card so that it's all paid off over the next year without the interest charges killing me.

Does this sound like the way to go?  Flaws in that plan?  Better alternatives?  I brought this on myself and aside from just not spending a dime and saving every penny I make, I'm not sure the best way to dig myself out.",finance,1426108322

personalfinance,"Reddit, I paid off my student loans today. $83,000 off my shoulders - I can breathe again!","My success isn't the best way, the easiest way, or the logical way - but it's my way, damnit, and they are done! These loans have been hanging over my head since I dropped out in 2008 and graduated in 2011.

I left a private university in 2008, uninspired and lost, having borrowed $72K for 3/4 of a BS in Business. I wandered for 2 years, making $19-23K/yr in Special Ed, and additional cash at whichever restaurant happened to be my night gig. Did not save a dime. Paid minimum on my loans ($600/mo). At one point, I had racked up $6K on a credit card. The one thing I did right was own a beater Volvo I had purchased for $500. Also, my private SL interest rates were incredibly low- 2.25-4.75%

At some point when I was 23, I realized I needed to smarten up. I tore up my credit card, walked into a state college and demanded that they enroll me that instant, or I might walk out and never come back. 

My first course of action was taking care of the $6K. I finished school with a BS in Business with a solid GPA, which allowed me to leave my $20k job and start exploring opportunities. I went through a few fails before finding my feet, all the while paying as much as I could toward loans. So pretty much minimum payment.

Then I got my current job- I'm a recruiter and I work with a small base ($25K) plus commission. Since the ""measly"" base pay was actually a raise for me... I looked at every single commission as a student loan payment and didn't look back. I bought a reliable car ($12k at 2.99%) and literally threw all the dollars I could at my mountain of debt. Still no savings, aside from a 401k that I contribute 11% to.

So, PF, today is the day, after 2 years in the sales/ recruiting industry, I can say I have PAID OFF my student loan debt! Although, it's been 7 years since I began, most of this I can attribute to the last 2. Phew!!

My situation is that I bought my house in Vancouver in 2009 during the recession and currently stand to make 120-140% tax free (No tax on capital gains on primary home in Canada) if I sell it. If I get a 5% return with the money I can earn around $110K. I have no debts. No family. Have enough emergency funds if I lose my job. 
Rumours around my neighbourhood is that it's a seller's market right now either due to the low mortgage rates or favourable foreign exchange rates. Bidding wars galore. To compare, the market is kinda like the SF Bay Area right now, except there's no $110k+ tech jobs. My thoughts are that the low commodity prices and high personal debts (Higher than Americans before the 2008 Recession) combined with the US interest rate increase later on will trigger a recession in Canada. My question is sell now and rent while hoping there's a price correction or keep it. Downside is that if there is no price correction then I don't gain anything unless I downsize.

personalfinance,Putting surprise federal tax bill on 0% APR credit card--does this plan make sense for me?,"My husband and I are grad students in our last semester of school. We each make about $15,000/year as research assistants. We are very, very careful with our money and have managed to get through eight years of grad school with zero debt, either in student loans or credit card balances. 

I have gotten a job that starts in September that will pay $70,000/year. We thought we were home free after years of living so frugally, but today we found out that our federal tax bill is $5000 and state bill is $1000. This is due to an untaxed fellowship that we thought we had put aside enough money for, but we miscalculated. We have $3000 put aside for the tax bill and thus are $3000 short.

My husband, who cannot stand to have debt of any kind, wants to put all of our savings toward this bill. We could cover the tax bill if we do this, but we would be left with zero savings, and an income of only $2700/month, with no income in July or August. We had budgeted savings to be used in those two months without income (during which we can't work because we need the time to finish and defend our dissertations), along with moving expenses, security deposits and rent, and other costs associated with the cross-country move to the city my new job is in. We need at least $2500 for all of these expenses (my employer is paying for part of the moving expenses up front). 

My suggested solution to this unexpected tax bill is to open a credit card with an introductory APR 0f 0%. We both have credit scores around 780 so we will qualify for the Citi Simplicity card with an 18-month intro rate of 0%. I think we should pay off the state tax bill of $1000, put the other $2000 toward the federal bill, and put the remaining $3000 on the credit card. We have a budget prepared for our new city and salary, and we will be able to pay off the balance by January 2016 at the latest. My husband is looking for a job but hasn't yet found one and I have about as close to guaranteed security as you can get with my job. We're also moving to a very low cost-of-living area and have already signed a lease on a house, so we will be living basically as we are now but will be making over double our current income.

Are there any reasons not to move forward with this plan? Anything we should consider instead?",finance,1426121128
investing,Is Adam Nash's analysis of Charles Schwab's fees correct?,"Adam Nash has an interesting post up on Medium regarding Schwab's intelligent portfolio. It highlights the fact that, while Shcwab is touts themselves as free (like WiseBanyan), they are earning a spread on cash. This is because while they will pay essentially nothing (0.12% on cash), they, as a broker dealer, will earn money on cash. This is something that all brokers and banks do. 

What is questionable is the way that Nash calculates that this will impact a portfolio. He starts with the basic idea that a young person investing at a 6% annual investment growth rate and a contribution of 10% of his salary of $65,000 - which will grow at 3% per year - will be have a total investment portfolio of $1.743 M after 40 years. My calculation is that this is that the value should be $1.624M if the 10% of salary contribution comes at the end of each year or $1.712M if the 10% of salary contribution comes at the beginning of each year. Perhaps he is compounding annually, but it still feels off.

More importantly, he says that allocating 6% to cash will cause the investor to have $138K less at the end of those 40 years. To arrive at the same conclusion (or the same ballpark, as I think that his numbers are off to begin with), I have to model that the cash portion, the 6% of the portfolio, is growing at just 0.12% per year. This results in a blended return of 5.68%.

There are two fundamental flaws with this:

1) It implies that interest rates will remain constant at next to nothing over the next 40 years. As interest rates are at historic lows, this is highly unlikely (not that I am betting interest rates rising, but historically, interest rates are dramatically higher).

2) It implies that the 6% is taken directly out of a portfolio that is yielding 6%. This may not be the case. What if it is taken out of a short term position that is yielding just 0.5%? I find it hard to imagine that, in the Schwab portfolio, the 6% that is in cash, is a substitute for the entire blended portfolio. More than likely, it is a substitution for a ""cash like"" portion of the portfolio. Even WiseBanyan and Wealthfront use ETF's that have very low yields as low risk diversifiers. If Schwab uses cash instead of low yield ETF's for low risk diversifies, the analysis by Nash is pretty misleading.

personalfinance,401k Loan for Home Purchase,"This is not your typical question about a 401k loan.

As far as I understand, the federal government will give me about $0.30 in refundable tax credits for every dollar I drop the taxable wages reported on my W-2 (projected $50k for 2015, married, two children). There are several ways to accomplish this without actually lowering my compensation or over-insuring. One is to contribute to an HSA through payroll, which I plan on considering come open enrollment. The other is to contribute pre-tax to the 401k plan through payroll.

So, my plan is to deliberately ""over contribute"" to my 401k to make funds available to take a 401k loan against thus lowering my W-2 wages and qualifying for more tax credits.

personalfinance,Tax advice for my mom,"Hi everyone,

I'm a long time subscriber to personal finance and find myself needing some advice of my own. 

My mom last year sold some of her land to end a soured business relationship with some relatives (we had chicken houses on our land that was a joint venture with our relatives). This was the first time my mom had ever had to use a lawyer in her life and also the first time she had ever sold land. The relationship should've ended earlier but there was always intimidation from the other party and just the cost associated with getting a lawyer, so for my mom this was a big thing and burden of relief for her to be finished with this. 

After the sale of the land my mom wanted to use the settlement money to pay off her mortgage completely so that she would only have to work part-time(she has some health issues), but we were left with about 30k left on the mortgage (which is still great) after the settlement money was over. 

The one thing my mom was not aware of was the taxes. I had asked her at the time and i think she believed that the taxes were taken out from the settlement. But doing her taxes recently she found out that she might owe $6k (her tax preparer is still going through the numbers) because it turns out that taxes weren't paid at the time of the sale.

My mom can't pay this all upfront without going into debt. And i want to help out but as someone who's newly engaged and saving for a wedding and a house I can only at most commit 1-2k.  My question for you PFers is what are her options in terms of payment? I know the IRS does payment plans for people who owe back taxes, does this also work for people who owe current taxes? And at what interest rate and what are the penalties? Finally, is this at all negotiable? i know it would likely be hard to negotiate this given that this is really a capital gains tax and it will be argued that we should have used the earnings from the sale for the tax payment, but i figured i would ask.

personalfinance,[Debt] 14k total debt (Car/CC's). Feel like I'm sinking... Want to get out of the consequences from stupid choices I've made in the past.,"TL;DR - College student in close to 7k of Credit Card Debt, 8k of car loan debt and just BARELY getting back from losing job late last year. Need help/advice.

Here's the long story: 

I am 24 years old, and am dealing with bad spending habits, living on my own/without help and a loss of stable income all whilst going to school. Now that I'm close to my personal breaking point, I am finally admitting to myself that I need help. 

I bought a car back in April of 2012 (2010 Impala) when I had a stable full-time job and part-time in school (evenings). I was notified of a management change at that job, and I was left with the choice of risk getting fired from a breathe-down-your-neck-only-here-to-cut-costs boss, or leave and pursue college. I chose the latter. 

Soon after, I applied for a close to home position which paid a bit more, but I didn't make it past the first month because of the original employee returning unexpectedly. It was a small, mom-and-pop location, so I didn't think anything big of it. This is where the fun starts.

After going to school full-time and using Unemployment Benefits to fund that, in November of last year (2014) I got swallowed in debt, used up my savings and filled up my credit cards to stay afloat whilst I looked for a job.

I sold a LOT of personal and cherished belongings: guitar, computer parts, headphones, speakers, laptop, tablet, some furniture, my bike (that one hurt to sell)... I'm at the MINIMUM.

I FINALLY found TWO new jobs, and I start this week and next week, but I need a plan. I need to attack this and get ready for school.

Job A (receptionist @ veterinary hospital) pays $14/hr and is flexible with the scheduling, particularly good for my class schedule. I can work a min of 20 hours there. I WOULD get more, but I have class on Tuesday/Thursday afternoons, which cuts in. 

Job B (tech assistant for a bar) is paying $12/hr and is night shifts (think after 8pm), not cutting in with class, and is also a min of 20 hours.

AFTER LATE MAY, CLASSES WILL NO LONGER BE AN ISSUE UNTIL LATE AUGUST/SEPTEMBER

Here's my financial breakdown:

* I have no more savings, as it ran out in December. 
* Have close to $7k in credit card debt with 7 different accounts. I think 3 are over-limit, and I am behind on one month of car payment (from previous of two).
* Paying $299/month for car loan of which $8.1k/2-years is left on the original 13k/5-year/8.69% loan.
* Monthly bills (^ including car loan up top) are: cell phone (~$75), internet/utilities/rent (living w/ a friend) ($100), Local Gym ($15), car insurance ($120), and minimums for CC's (ranging from $25-$50, so a MAX of $400 monthly). No more Spotify, Netflix (using friend's).
* Credit Score has plummeted from low 700's to 520's.
* I am checking Credit Karma for all of this info.

I can include DETAILED info such as balances/interest rates, but it will take a bit of time, as I am currently working on a school project for my Developmental Psych class.

I am at an all-time personal low, and my confidence/self-esteem is taking a hit... Even with the new jobs to help me get back on track, my credit score is abysmal, I am going to need time to get back on track but I feel like I have exhausted it all and let my credit score take the hit. I feel alone, tired and rather stupid and immature... Growing up, I had no one really teach me about finances, and to be honest, I don't know how I will be able to handle school (California State School) bills/schedule with all this debt. I don't know how BAD this is in comparison to others', but for ME, this is just the worst. 

I want my savings back. I want my life back on track... I just need some help and guidance.",finance,1426131562

I am a medical resident and just completed my first complete tax year working full time (2nd year working).  Prior to starting residency I went through the IRS worksheet to determine how many exemptions I should take and it said I should take 2 (one for me, one for my wife) so that's what I took.  My wife didn't take any exemptions.  We just finished working out or taxes with my father-in-law (who is a CPA) and we now owe 3k in federal and 2k in state taxes.  

We budget, we aggressively save, I maxed my contribution to our Roth IRA (we only have one between the two of us for now).  We live in a tiny apartment in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood (in San Francisco so this is still our highest budget item, but rent is &lt;1/3 our take home pay).

From what I can gather, my best bet would be to do a fixed rate, secured loan with either a credit union, bank (chase, wells fargo, etc) or peer to peer lending service (prosper, lendingclub etc).

My credit score is above 680, and I have a car and/or motorcycle I might be willing to use as collateral. After some calculations on my budget and expenses, I've figured that I can afford a monthly payment in the ranges from $150-$400. This fluctuates based on what loan amount I receive and what subsequent other debts that amount can relieve (making room for higher payments). 

So, questions that are still pretty foggy for me are:

1) What should I bring to the table when negotiating/requesting a loan? (ie. documents, terms,  collateral, jargon) 

2) Who would you name as first three lenders you would goto in this situation?

3) What kind of interest rates should I expect?

4) What should I absolutely not agree too (ie. terms, APR, etc)?

5) Does requesting a higher amount make it more likely a financial institution will accept? (ie, $700 vs $6000)

6) Where would you recommend to go for sound financial advice that has the lowest fee? (Free would be awesome lol).

I do not trust my current car to drive the 500 mile round trip between my house and school. And I'll be making this trip several times per semester. My current car has been in the shop more times than I care to admit, and the only reason it still runs is because my parents ate the vast majority of the charges pushing them even further into debt.

On the other hand, my current car is a complete POS, and I'm terrified of it conking out on me halfway home or halfway to school.

But it's paid for. I don't owe anything on it.

Should I take out a student loan for a car? If I do, how much should I keep it under?

Should I just try to make it with my current one? If it does give out, a student loan would probably be my only option. Is it still an option that should be considered?

personalfinance,My fiance's parents are trying to claim him as a dependent and I'm about to have an aneurysm,"My fiance graduated from a public university in early May of 2014. After he graduated, he moved in with me and I financially supported him (along with some support from his own savings) until he was accepted into a military scholarship program and started medical school (much more expensive than the state school). He also gets a stipend from the military for his living expenses - we split our combined expenses evenly between the two of us.

I recently got my tax return from the IRS and out of curiosity I asked my fiance if he had filed his taxes yet. He said his father had asked him not to file until they filed so that they could claim him as a dependent. 

I got pretty upset - mostly because I was reminded of when three years ago I went through the painful ordeal with my parents of filing my own independent return and not allowing them to claim me as a dependent (looking at all of the IRS rules and crunching the numbers, they didn't qualify to claim me as a dependent). 

IMO - my fiance has several thousand dollars worth of tax credits he is entitled to, and his parents are trying to buck the system to save a bit of change (I believe their financial issues are their own problem). If his federal refund is more than his parents would save on their taxes, I especially don't feel it's right for them to try to claim him has a dependent.

I should also note that I work full-time and I am the more financially experienced and savvy one in this relationship. 

What would you do in this situation? I'm not trying to control my fiance's finances or want that refund for myself (it's his). But I also feel like he has a knowledge gap with finances, and his parents are technically violating the law and preventing him from getting money that he is entitled to. Ultimately I will respect his decision - but I want to empower him with financial knowledge. I even suggested that he do the numbers and see what the difference between his return and the savings his parents would have on their taxes, and possibly pay them what they would have saved (because they did partially support him last year).",finance,1426170230

Her estate was mostly donated to local charities, however the house was set to be sold and the money from this was to be distributed to the beneficiaries. We received a check for roughly 40,000.

From what I have read, lump sums of cash are not taxable however if there was a gain on the house there could be capital gains tax. What I am confused about though is since the house was first sold by the estate and then the funds were distributed are we liable for any capital gains or should that have been paid first by the estate? Also to add a little confusion to the situation, my aunt lived in California and I live in Nebraska. California does not have an inheritance tax however Nebraska does, do I still have to pay this tax since the funds came from out of state?

My last question is in regards to federal taxes. Although I do not know the exact amount of the entire estate I believe that it is above the 5.3 million that is applicable for a federal estate tax. If the distribution of the estate was just the sale of the house and the rest went to charities is this still applicable?

Dividend for 2015 should be around $1,100 and is currently set to go towards the loan balance.  The dividend can be applied towards the premium, but not the loan interest.

personalfinance,I've done all the obvious (sidebar) stuff. Now I have some extra money and not sure where to start applying it.,"I'm 26. Been working my first ""real"" job for about a year. I make good, but not great, money. I have student loan payments that I have been working on paying down. My strategy has been to pay the minimum on my ""reasonable"" interest rate loans, and paying extra on the highest one. And I've made some good progress.

I've also been dumping some extra money each month into my emergency fund. I have about 3 months' worth saved up. Which I know is the minimum people recommend, but I'm comfortable with it (for now) given my job security and everything. 

I also just received a bonus from my company for 2014. It's not crazy huge - a couple thousand. But given that I have some extra sitting in my checking account as well, for the first time I have a sizable chunk of money with no obvious purpose.

Well, I suppose I do have obvious options. I could put it towards extra loan payments. Or build up that emergency fund a bit more. But I also don't have any money saved for retirement. My company doesn't offer a 401k, so I have been researching IRAs. My parents also gifted me some money to buy a few shares of stock last Christmas (just to get my feet wet), so I've been researching some investing stuff too.

And based on that, I'm leaning towards opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard and putting money towards their Target Retirement fund. I sort of realized that I don't know enough about investing to do it myself, plus I wouldn't want to gamble with my retirement savings, so this seems like a pretty brainless and effective way to save. Any thoughts?

And yes, I know that paying off student loans gives me an instant X% return on my money, but I feel comfortable with where I'm at on those and investing has the potential to meet (or exceed) that.

personalfinance,Very complicated personal finance question,"So I have a pretty complicated tax situation with my retirement plans.

I have 2 jobs and both consider me at 50% (0.5 FTE) so I'm treated as a full time employee at both places for retirement benefits. The following plans are available for me:

Job 1 is a with the federal government so:
1) TSP - matches the first 5% of contributions

Job 2 is private but with state govt:
1) 401(a) - mandatory &amp; matches twice the first 5%, (i.e. empolyer contributes 10%)
2) 403(b) - voluntary no matching
3) 457 - voluntary no matching

So from my understanding, the employee contribution limit is $18,000 for the TSP and the 403(b) combined; a separate $18,000 for the 457; and the 401(a) does not factor into these limits.

And these limits are for employer contribution and does not factor into the employee contribution. There's a separate limit for total contributions.

Does that all seem correct?

The IRS website says the $18,000 limit in 2015 is for 403(b), 401(k), and MOST 457 plans combined. How do you know if your 457 is part of that limit?

personalfinance,"[First post] 35; laid off; expensive rent, etc. I need some help!","Hello /r/personalfinance!

I was laid off (with 39 other people) on Feb 1. I live in FL, which has the lowest dollar amount unemployment benefit in the 50 states. (Yes; FL sucks in many, many ways!): $275 a week, max.

This'll pay my rent, but nothing else. 

I want to get the heck out of FL: I was born here, and I'll be damned if I die here. I can break my lease and move back home with Mom (at age 35, this terrifies me!) but: 

* Rental company requires **60 days** notice to move out, **AND** a 2 month rent fee for breaking the lease (so, ~2k.) 

That fee, plus being forced to stay for 2 months pretty much wipes out my last remaining savings AND my tax return money. :(

* ACS and Nelnet are CONSTANTLY on my heels RE: student loans. Most federal, some private. I am trying to get hardship deferment. (Currently +100 days past due on one; They've reported me to credit bureaus already.)

* Because I am... not in the most positive mental state, I haven't looked at my credit report this year: Last year, with one agency at least, I had an ""A"". I fear that has gone down a bunch, and... I just don't have the psychic wherewithal to check it, knowing it'll be depressing.

So, how's this for a plan: Move back home with Mom, try to work for a few months. Save money to move. Search for jobs all the while; move wherever will hire me. (MA linguistics, ESL certification, looking for adjunct english / ESL positions... anywhere in NA.)

But if I move home, is it worth working, or should I just collect unemployment for 6 months? If I work, the student loan payments come back, and I can save less...

Honestly, going on unemployment for a few months seems like the best course of action, but I fully admit I'm not thinking straight right now.

personalfinance,"Have debt, but more equity, but not a ton of liquid cash to pay towards debt. Interested in consolidation.","**The Bad**

My wife and I  have more debt than we'd like.  It's not something that we can't deal with in terms of minimum payments and then some, but it certainly cramps us, and I'd rather contribute to a bigger emergency fund and our retirement than continue to pay the rate of interest I'm paying, if I can help it.  The debt is as follows:

* $21.5k in student loans at 6.8% (you want irony?  I work in the non-profit sector, and with the new student loan forgiveness plan, my forgiveness would be in the same year it would be paid off anyway, assuming minimum payments - roughly 7 years from now)

* Roughly $9k in credit card debt - a combination of a few bad decisions we don't make anymore and some bad luck. $2k of this is on a card with no interest until December.

**The Good**

* We are very lucky.  Due to windfall, we own our home (valued at $235k) outright.  We live in an area that is getting more desirable, so as long as we don't let things go to hell (and there is no market crash), it will likely have increased in value when we're ready to sell it in 10 years or so.

* We also own both of our cars outright.  They're not fancy and we keep them in good condition, but my wife's car probably only has a couple more years in it.

* We've cut a lot of the fat out of our budget in the last year (I think we can afford to cut some more out, too) and at this point are living comfortable frugal within our means

**This, That and the Other Thing**

* Our monthly budget fluctuates due to my wife working as an independent contractor but we budget for about $3000/month.  Generally, I can throw anywhere from $300-$600/month at the credit cards after the student loan payment.  If she makes more, we pay more towards credit cards.

* We have about $9k in an emergency fund

* We have two (step for me) kids.  Lots of our budget goes to feeding them not-crap, since we have a teen who can pretty much eat us out of house and home. ALSO, the kids' dad owes at least $8k in back child support from being unemployed off and on.  We've left the authorities out of it because he's very present in the kids' lives and getting a court order would sour a cordial relationship with him.  I'm open to any ways to pressure him to pay this back to us (and we may ultimately need to get authorities to step in and garnish wages).

* We are young parents have more earning potential and will probably be in a comfortable place in 5-10 years if we continue live pretty frugally.

* We are not horribly behind on retirement, but we are behind.  Ideally, I'd like to free up the cash flow to contribute more to my 403(b) and contribute more to the Roth IRAs I have set up for my wife.

* Even if I don't free up a lot of extra cash flow now, in a couple of years we'll probably have to get rid of my wife's car and get her a newer one, and I want to be prepared for that.

**Possible solutions**

It seems to me that there are two solutions that make sense.  I don't think it's a good idea to pay interest on my credit cards anymore:

* 1: Use a big chunk of the emergency fund to pay off the credit cards.  Continue to pay the minimum on my student loan.  Once the cards are paid off in full, aggressively pay to the emergency fund until it's at least at the $10k mark, and then contribute aggressively toward retirement and investment funds.

* 2: Get a home equity loan to consolidate the debt.  Even an equity loan at 6% over 15 years would be a significant improvement to a 6.8% college loan over 10 years plus credit cards.  Have the freed up cash flow now to invest in retirement now rather than a couple years down the road, and maybe do a couple of small improvements on our home.  With equity over $200k and steady work for both my wife and I, I don't think a bank would consider a home equity loan in the $30,000 - $40,000 range a risky investment.  We'd obviously want to act pretty fast on this, since interest rates will be going up.

Thoughts?

TL;DR: I have about $30k in debt (2/3 student loans, 1/3 credit card).  I own my house and cars outright.  I don't make a ton but have steady income.  I could use my emergency fund to pay off the credit cards, but I'd rather take out a home equity loan to consolidate everything and lower what I'm paying now.  I just want someone to let me know if this raises any red flags.",finance,1426192866

I made a little over $5k in CA and a little over 1k in PA.



- I am under the impression that I won't end up owing federal income tax, but I will owe CA, (I don't know about PA)-- is this correct?

- I have several receipts for work on my work vehicle (a bike), including one that involved shipping the bike across the country. In this case, a mistake was made with the shipment and I ended up having to pay for 3 separate cross country trips to finally get the bike. Can I deduct all of the costs of this shipping since it was my work vehicle and I went from working in one market to another?

- is it viable for me to use myfreetaxes.com? If not, what is the best online filing tool for 1099 stuff?

- I have two semesters of school that were paid for in 2014 by another family member-- does this student status impact my filing at all?

investing,How are Currencies Traded?,"In the last post I discussed the very basics of currency trading. In this post, we’re going to look at the more specifics of currency trading. How exactly are currencies traded? Are currency traders making short term or long term bets? What trading strategies do they typically use?

Currencies Involve Leverage
First of all, currency fluctuations, on their own, are very, very small.

For example, year-to-date (from the beginning of 2013 until now) the Euro has advanced a mere 3%! That’s ridiculously small! 3% is chicken scratch, much less than the 25% that the U.S. stock market has generated this year (assuming you’re looking at the S&amp;P500).

Thus, in order to make a decent amount of money, currency traders must employ a ton of leverage (borrowed money). As you probably know, leverage increases your potential returns but also you’re risk.

The standard amount of leverage that currency traders employ is 10x. That means for every $1 you have, you will borrow $9, thereby multiplying your total position size by 10 times. Thus, a mere 3% gain, multiplied by 10, becomes 30%. Of course, if you lose 3%, 10x leverage will increase your losses to 30%. But because fluctuations are so small in the currency market, currency traders have no choice but to use leverage.

Currency Traders are Short Term Traders, which does not include “buy and hold”.
Take a look at the chart below:

The chart above is the 1 year chart for Euro:USD. As you can see, the individual fluctuations are small: usually no more than 6 cents up or 6 cents down. However, coupled with a 10x leverage, that 6 cents soon turns into a 60 cent gain or loss (6×10 = 60). 60 cents is equivalent to a 50% fluctuation.

Because currencies tend to fluctuate within a range, all currency traders are making short term bets. These short term bets can range from a mere hours to weeks, but no more. Thus, currency trading is definitely not for a long term investor, because there are no long term profits (as mentioned, Euro from year-to-date has increased a mere 3 cents)!

If the Euro:USD falls 3 cents, then rises 3 cents, then falls 3 cents, then rises 3 cents, the long term investor just made a grand total of $0! However, a currency trader who tries to catch each short term movement would have made a ton of money.

Currencies Involve Big Fundamentals
The currency market is arguably the market that most involves the fundamentals of an entire nation. Whereas a huge part of the stock market is about small fundamentals (eg are the companies revenues increasing? Are costs decreasing?), currencies are mainly affected by national fundamentals (eg how is America’s balance of trade? How is Europe’s economy doing as a whole?).

That is one of the things that got me attracted to currencies in the first place. I’ve always been a social science kind of guy – I love to understand how the world works.

Thus, although currencies typically swing within a range, there are general trends. For example, the Euro has been generally increasing in value this year although it has had some pretty big swings. These general trends are always caused by fundamentals. Compared to 2012, the economic situation in Europe has improved drastically (hurray for green shoots!). That’s why the Euro has been generally appreciating relative to the USD this year.

So if you do intend on trading currencies, always make sure you know what the fundamentals of a nation (or in Europe’s case, a federation) are. Is the country’s economy improving or getting worse?

Currency Traders also Invest in Commodities
On a last note (this will lead into my next post), a lot of currency traders also invest in commodities. Why? Because the value of a currency will affect the value of commodities (eg oil, gold, silver, wheat, corn, copper). All commodities are listed globally in U.S. dollars (again, because of the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement). Commodities are physical assets. If inflation hits, the value of the USD will go down, while the nominal value (in USD) of commodities (e.g. oil) will go up.

That’s why all those who invest in commodities generally pay attention to currencies (that’s me!), and all those who trade currencies will also invest in commodities.",finance,1426206941

personalfinance,How can I get ahead and not live paycheck to paycheck?,"Hello!  I have been a lurker for a while, especially on the sub. I have finally decided to post to get some suggestions for everyone. 
My back story. I am a foreign medical student who went overseas for medical school. (I am US citizen) I am currently completing my rotations and about to graduate in June. I decided to post here because of my financial issues.  
Because of finances I have had to get a job to help pay for school. So I work full time at a great job as well as attend rotations for 3-4 hours 1 day a week. I came to this sub to get some advice as to where I can get ahead in my finances. I have listed below my income and expenses 

INCOME 

1,131.00- pay bi-monthly (38K a year) 

125.00-side job online tutoring (sometimes increases due to student demands)

BILLS

900.00-rent (I rent from a family friend who gives me a great deal, I live inner city in a wonderful area and it’s a 15 minute commute to work) 

40.00- Electric bill 

Gas/car care-50.00 a month (I walk most places and only drive to work, I pay my parents a lump sum in Jan every year for car insurance. So that is already taken care of. I own my car.)

Med school tuition -1,000 a month until Aug. 

50.00- food (thanks to two crock pots and reddit frugal I am pretty good at sticking to this) 

25.00 –fun money 

I don’t have cable or internet. My sister is nice enough to let me use her Netflix account for free!

My work pays for my cell phone bill, I use my phones personal hotspot for internet at my apartment

I do not have any emergency fund or really any savings. I do have a lot of stocks and savings bonds but those are not really of much help in this point. I have looked in to Food Stamps but I make too much. I have looked at other places for assistance but I don’t have a lease. I can get one but it will just take a while as my landlord lives where I went to medical school (in another country). I cannot get a roommate, I live in a one bedroom. I understand that my med school expenses really cut into my budget and federal loans are not an option.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!",finance,1426256760

personalfinance,Want financial advice. Just began investing and want input if I'm doing it right.,"Long time lurker, first time poster on Personal Finance.  I wanted to share where I am financially and get some input on how to maximize my profit for an early (hopefully) retirement.
 
Current Situation:
 
26 years old, just bought our first house in June, married, I bring in ~$75K, wife brings in ~40K.  We have miscellaneous income that averages about $3500 a year.   Monthly Expenses $5200 a month, monthly income after tax and after TSP donations - $5900
 
I work for the Federal Govt. so I invest 6% of my Paycheck into TSP (Like a 401K) and they match up to 5%.  Currently I am contributing $650 a month and that will go up as my pay increases (Fair assumptions are 3% a year average)  current balance is $34k.
 
I also contribute $150 a month to an “At Arms Length” fund which is invested but can be accessed if we have any major project or trip we would like to go on. 
 
$150 a month to a Roth IRA in my wife’s name.  We use our tax return or some of the miscellaneous to max out Roth at the end of the year.
 
$300 a month for two whole life insurance policies (this is included in my monthly expenses)
 
$300 a month we place into a cash savings account. 
 
In February 2016 I will have my Student Loan and Car paid off.  This will free up an additional $750 a month 
 
Also in September of 2015 we should be having an increase in income of about $400 a month after tax.  (We are both scheduled to get raises)

personalfinance,(US) Refinance an 30yr FHA home loan after only 2 years to take advantage of lower PMI?,"I'm trying to figure out if it is worth it to refinance my home loan.  The current amount on the loan is about 142k, the home was appraised at 155k when loan was taken out.  My current PMI is about 170$ a month unless I'm mistaken.  My interest rate on the loan is 3%.  
My loan was taken out just after the PMI rules changed to make you have to pay PMI for the lifetime of the loan...

So far speaking to a loan officer she said she didnt see how it would be worth it much because: the best rate she could give me atm would be 3.2% interest ( so up 0.2% ), I would have to pay closing costs again, I would have 2 more years on my loan since I'm 2 down and going back up to 30, and ""it would only save me $5 a month on principal and interest and only about $55

I have a question regarding payroll taxes. I live in New Jersey fairly close to Philadelphia, close enough that most of the jobs I get are in that area.

I just received my first paycheck and I am just absolutely astounded by how much money has been taken out and all of the money taken out was for Philadelphia and Pennsylvania.

I still maintain a New Jersey residence, the correct address is on my pay stub. I've worked in PA and lived in NJ before and if I remember correctly, I'll have to check when I get home, I was responsible for New Jersey taxes, not Pennsylvania.

I am paying federal, PA income tax, PA unemployment, and PA PHILA-Phi INC. The last one (Phila Phi Inc) took out quite a bit of money.

Now I didn't actually fill out the paper work prior to getting on payroll. My boss called it in and I don't know what I'm claiming, but I am a 27 year old female I'm so low income that I qualify for free health care and could probably get food stamps if I wanted.

personalfinance,How do I best get out of subletting from my financially irresponsible future-in-laws?,"Background: My boyfriend and I moved in together last year when I graduated and got a job, he is in his final year of a bachelor's degree. The problem is, both of us were working on campus for federal work-study, giving the paychecks directly to our parents (to help cover tuition), then spending money as authorized users on their credit cards while living on-campus. As a result, neither of us has any effective credit, renting, or employment history. Boyfriend is also still in school and being fully supported by his parents.

When I applied for apartments for us, I was rejected because we have no history, two dogs, and a low salary total (although Boyfriend's parents are currently paying his bills while he is in school). Boyfriend's parents offered to be the guarantors of the apartment, with us as subletters, so that we could find somewhere to live, which we were very grateful for. They applied for an apartment and were instantly approved (wealthy homeowners) and we moved in. It was decided that they would pay for rent, insurance, and utilities since they were covering Boyfriend's share anyway, and I would write them a check for my half every month.

However, they have turned out to be incredibly irresponsible and are screwing me over. Despite multiple requests, I have never been put on the renter's insurance (we live in a dangerous area and *really* need it). They frequently wait 4+ weeks to cash my rent checks. On one occasion, ""the autopay failed"" and although they had cashed my checks, we got an eviction notice! Doesn't that mean they were notified of nonpayment?

I am concerned that this is (1) damaging my credit/renting history as a result of the eviction notice, (2) putting me in financial risk by not having me insured, (3) preventing me from building my own renter's history since I have no direct payments to the renting office, (4) putting us both at risk for being evicted.

What is my best way out of this situation? Should I just go in and be honest with the renting office (very nice people who have gone out of their way to help us) and see if they can set me up as a co-renter rather than a subletter? What can I do about getting on the guarantor's homeowner's insurance if they are dragging their feet/dodging the issue?",finance,1426273710
personalfinance,(UK) Need advice regarding my situation and my parents situation with their debt please!,"Hey all,

First of all thanks for reading this, lurker for a while and first time posting - brief, my parents are in debt and stuck. Also, sorry for essay. I really need to just get this off my chest and listen to what other people have to say so anything is welcome here. 

A bit of BG info..
After all expenses, I have around 375/month left, 250 of that I'm going to start putting in to savings. I have £500 savings and that's it. I recently moved back in with my parents so I could start saving and live more comfortably (was living on the bread line in my own place). I moved back early Feb this year. I give my parents £250/month house-keeping.

Parents BG: 
They are married. My step-dad is unfit to work. My mum has been his full time carer since they got together pretty much. SDad receives DLA benefit from the gov. and my mum receives Carer's Allowance, from the gov.

Despite the situation and some may think that my sdad is reliant upon my mum (he is in many ways) my mum is entirely reliant upon him as he is whom receives money and my mum receives pretty much nothing - carers allowance is like £60/week.

Years ago they filed for bankruptcy and this caused them to be debt free and start fresh, disregarding credit rating etc. Unfortunately, to which I am really frustrated about, they have got themselves back in to a similar situation. Whilst I don't entirely blame my sdad for the debt they are in now, he is the one who handles all the money, I can't believe the lengths he's gone to. They have both lived beyond their means, but my sdad has just gone overboard. 

Here is what he has done so far (what I'm aware of):

- About one month ago my mum found out that he hasn't been paying water rates for like 4 months, which I actually believe is against the law given that water rates is an essential bill for living. His excuse was that they wanted to save money for Christmas - ridiculous I know.

- They started a 'catalogue' account where you join a website and buy things off it without having the money, a credit card in that sense, and then you pay back with interest. Not only did my sdad stop making payments, he made three additional accounts on this same site in different names, to buy luxury things - they can now not afford to pay any of it back because they missed payments and the first initial payment until the monthly payments go back to normal is something ridiculous due to the bite on interest rate. He made an additional account in my mums name. Baring in mind that my mum didn't know any of this - she thought they only had the two accounts. She found out when she saw a statement come through the post.

- A letter from a bank he isn't even associated with came through today and when my mum questioned him on it, he said he was just looking for a bank that doesn't charge for premium standard accounts (load of BS) since they only pay £10/month for their current account. We reckon he's looking for a credit card to max out - idk.

- My mum also found out two weeks ago that he owes money to the government from since before they even got together, from a loan. He changed his name and they finally caught up with him. The monthly payments aren't crazy but with all of the other debts they have now accumulated they can't afford pretty much anything.

The worst part is, despite all of this, it's like my dad expects my mum to sort out all of the debt he's caused, since my mum can work but isn't doing. My mum has been looking for a job that fits in with her current commitments and restrictions - I've been helping her sort her CV out. She's going to a job centre and agencies next week to get the ball rolling properly.

Can't confirm amount of debt since my mum doesn't even know but she thinks it'll be between 3k and 4k (not including the money my sdad owes regarding the loan he took out before they met and not including anything else he's done behind her back).

I also wasn't aware of any of their debts prior to moving back in - caught my mum crying a couple weeks back and she just blurted it all out to me.

Whenever she talks about it she just starts crying because she feels so helpless and she can't just walk away from the marriage because she has nowhere to go and she does still love him even though she knows herself she needs to leave him - neither of us can afford to move out now.

My mum's plan is to get a job on top of her caring for my sdad, she can earn an additional £110/week on top of carer's allowance if she wants to work part-time. I've said it may be wise to come off carers and get a full-time job. She wants to get money under her belt, in her own bank account, where she can save up herself and also help towards paying these debts off.

They've been borrowing money off me for a while already (about £70 it adds up to now) and I doubt they can give it me back anytime soon. I'm finding it pretty difficult to say no when they ask me for money, cause I know how my mum feels. She can't even afford to get her own mum a mothers day card tomorrow.

I think that pretty much wraps it up and any advice that you can give me would be much appreciated! I've likely missed some important details out since I've no format to this whatsoever and improvised - if there's anything else you need to know just ask.

Thank you to anyone in advance for taking the time to read this and to anyone who can offer advice and opinions about what I should do or be doing, what my mum should do or what all of us should do as a unit to get over this hurdle of debt.",finance,1426273917

personalfinance,Moving On From College Checking Account,"Hi PF, longtime lurker just looking for opinions on managing my checking account. I opened a college checking account about 6 years back when I first started college with Wells Fargo and it has been my primary and only bank account that I use. Lately whenever I have to go to the bank or call the bank, they keep mentioning to me about how I should change my account or something along those lines... unfortunately I always do this stuff on the clock at work/lunch and just have to leave or hang up before I get the chance to listen. Also I generally hate listening to sales pitches and would rather do my own research before agreeing to anything upfront like that. 

Anyways, I've been reading up on some threads here and see a lot of posters have made the switch from Wells Fargo/BoA/Chase/etc. to other less conventional banking options such as Schwab/Ally/Federal Credit Unions. I was hoping to see if any of you could help me in determining if opening a new checking account would be a good idea for me.

Some basic information about myself... I have 4 credit cards that I try to use frequently and pay off in full every month, one of which is a Wells Fargo VISA. My credit score is fairly good 760+. I've slowly built up my savings and make sure to keep at all times $10K+ in it.

Lastly, I personally don't have anything negative to say about Wells Fargo. My experience with them has been nothing short of excellent. When I need anything, they are very quick and helpful and I have never been charged any ""hidden"" fees by them. With that being said, I am very new to managing my finances and am very open to exploring my options you could say. The more you know right?

personalfinance,First Time Home Buyers Getting Borked,"Okay, so my husband and I are purchasing our first home. We live in Oregon and there are an abundance of programs designed to help first time home buyers with their home purchase. 

However, after a number of conversations with lenders and staff from these programs, it has been determined that we don't qualify because we make too much money.

Our income is about 125K and we have three kids. We currently rent our home and we're at the point where we are done dumping $2200 a month into something that isn't ours.

We're looking at an FHA loan, so it isn't like we need an enormous amount of money ($14K for a $350K house) but it seems like we're going to be saving our pennies forever in the absence of any type of assistance.

Asking both of our parents is out of the question, and we're worried about interest rates, which we're told are going to start to rise over the course of the next few months.

It seems like we keep taking one step forward and two steps back. We manage to save up money, and then something comes up; someone's car needs a major repair, a kid ends up in the hospital, etc. I realize we are doing this all backwards, but this is just the way our life is. I feel like we are pretty much never going to get ahead. 

I guess what I am asking is, do we just sit here and continue to rent? Do we have any other options, or is even exploring this right now an exercise in futility? Is there an option that we haven't explored or something we are overlooking?

personalfinance,Parents own real estate and it's becoming a hassle for them.,"Hey everyone. Came here to get some advice on our family's situation.

Background: My parents (dad 66 semi retired mom 64 retired) own real estate property with two homes on the lot. They bought the property back in the 80s and refinanced it back in 2006 at the appraised value at the time and they were able to cash our their gains. According to Zillow the house is currently valued at about $420,000. The current mortgage/loan has a balance of approximately $376,643 on it remaining with about 21 years left on the loan and monthly payments of $2900 for easy calculations ($2896 for those that really want to be precise). They rent out both homes to separate families for a total of $2350 (I know it's a negative but they've always wanted to help out renters because they knew what it was like). The difference between the monthly mortgage and the rent collected is paid by me, yours truly. The name on the property is the whole family, my dad and mom and the three children. The name on the loan is my dad. 

Situation: We decided to do some work on the homes. Exterior/interior painting, roofing and switching out the windows to help give the homes a modern look. Nothing major all in all we're spending between $5000-$7000 to fix the place up. Yesterday, the tenants complained the drainage was backed up and we had to get a plumber scheduled to come out and fix it up. This wouldn't have been an issue in the past because my dad and I would try to do the repairs but all this fixing up however has opened up my parent's eyes to how hard it is to maintain the place and having to deal with the tenants as they get older. They also feel bad for me having to cover the deficit in the mortgage (we'll just say $60,000+ total over the last 9 years) and think now is the time to sell and to get rid of the property. I told my parents not to worry about me and that after all of the work being done was finished, there wouldn't be much to worry about for awhile and that this would payoff for me again in the long term. 

Am I right and should we just hold on to the property? Are they right? Should we just get rid of the property now? What would you guys do in this situation? Advice? Thanks!

tl;dr parents own property and they're starting to be fed up with it and want to sell.",finance,1426280138
personalfinance,Need some input on federal student loan debt,"Not sure if I formatted this correctly and I am at work so if not I will try to fix it. Anyway, I found out that I can consolidate Direct Loans and still maintain good repayment options as I am currently on IBR.

Is it wise for me to consolidate all of these into one and maintain my IBR?

Bitcoin,"Are all blockchains required to be fully public and mint coin as reward, or can private blockchains exist with public access?","It is my belief that when IBM, or the FED, or any other big centralized system tries to take advantage of so-called 'blockchain' technology, that they will almost for sure restrict who is allowed to 'mine' transactions.

It might be an open network that anyone can use to send and receive transactions, but the process as to whether those transactions will be allowed, or not, will be restricted to servers under their control.

The advantage of such a system is that you still get near instantaneous transfer of value world-wide.  It is immutable and irreversible.  These are qualities of bitcoin which we all love and seem far superior to the existing system.

End-users would be able to send and receive money, nearly instantaneously and with low fees, transactions would be irreversible, and the unit of account would be in a stable fiat currency.  Users would be able to perform online transactions without giving away their private key (unlike as is the case with credit cards today).

So these are the advantages.  The disadvantages are many.

With a system like this I would fully expect the network of miners, spread around the world but still fully vetted by ownership, to introduce draconian measures for transaction processing.

* You would not be able to operate on the network anonymously
* You could be blacklisted so even though you have your private key, you couldn't spend the funds

The network would still be considered 'trust-less' so that for a hacker to steal any money, it would be just like the existing 51% attack requirement for bitcoin.  

If a hacker was able to forge the credentials or otherwise hack into a banking systems machine (not an easy thing to do, but possible) they would still be operating on a trust-less network and be unable to game the system.  

I have been having this discussion in another thread and nearly everyone keeps approaching this like a binary thing.  They claim you are either fully centralized and private, or fully decentralized and public, and there can be nothing in between.

I don't believe it is that simple.  I think that a centralized group of authority (collection of banks, governments) could all agree to a set of rules and membership, but the network would use blockchain technology so that it would validate transactions among those members.  Meaning, membership is centralized, but transaction processing is not.

I do not believe that miners *must* be 100% public, nor *must* they always reward miner with the issuance of coins of value.

Miners can be private and can be rewarded by larger business goals.  Yet, this private group can still provide public access to the network and use trustless technologies to make hacking as difficult as it is on the bitcoin network today.",cryptocurrency,1426280907

Since then, the company has produced YOY revenue growth (with another 50% harvest increase for the Q4 that ends March 31, 2015).

They are a farm management company that primarily grows stevia, the natural alternative sweetener that they then sell to PureCircle, who refines and sells it to Coca-Cola and Pepsi for their new colas (Coke Life and Pepsi True).

In 2014, they began producing revenues from their aquaculture operations, fish farms that are fed using stevia extracts and byproducts, which they use to supply Darden Restaurants and Red Lobster.

In 2014, they also announced that they would begin development on a US bulk hemp subsidiary called Real Hemp LLC, and they have since announced that they are leveraging their extraction experience and processes to extract cannabidiol (CBD) from hemp. They have filed several patents for over-the-counter combination painkiller &amp; CBD medications, as well as a new delivery system for the medications. Hopes are revenues from these operations will materialize in late 2015 or early 2016.

The company became profitable last year and it's now a matter of scaling operations before investors see substantial revenues.

personalfinance,Penalties for withdrawing money from an IRA and not putting it into another one.,"A couple years back, I worked at a job for a construction company. As part of my work, I helped work on a jobsite that was federal land. While I was being paid only $10 an hour by my company, the federal rate for my job was at $18 an hour. The company took the extra $8 an hour and put it into an IRA with a company they worked with. However, since having my money moved into this IRA, I've slowly seen the amount of money go down. Now, I personally never wanted this IRA to be set up and used, but only recently did I take any actions to move it. I asked the company for the money to be redistributed to me in a check, and after they took out a (rather large) fee, I am left with $875 and change. I'm a young adult, and while I know saving this money for later would be a good idea, I want to use this to get a few things that I've needed for a while, and not transfer it over to another IRA. My questions are as follows:

* What fees would I have to pay in order to use this money now?
* When would those fees need to be paid?
* Would the fee/s that I am paying need to be specifically from that money, or would I be able to deduct the payment of the fees from my income at my current job so I can keep the lump sum together for what I need to buy with it?   

Any assistance with these questions will be appreciated.

personalfinance,Great Lakes Payments / Interest,"Posted this on r/studentloans and didn't really get much feedback. I know this technically isn't a typical PF issue, but a lot of you have had to deal with student loans so I'm hoping someone can help me out.

So I have a bit of a conundrum with Great Lakes. As many of you know, Great Lakes combines your loans into a centralized loan to make it ""easier"" to pay back loans, and it is quite troublesome to get them to unbundle your loans so that you may pay them in the order you'd like. A post I read on a sub the other day (that I since cannot find) stated that upon finally getting GL to unbundle the loans, the poster noticed that GL had not only not been applying the payments the way they state that they will on their website (highest interest rate first), but that they had also not been applying the 0.25% interest rate reduction for direct deposit. 

This post prompted me to check my own situation, so I emailed GL about unbundling. They informed me that unbundling would make my payment go way up (min. $50/loan/month), and I can't afford that right now. So I emailed again to try to get my loans' payment histories (by individual loan, instead of grouped), and was met with rejection. Their reply states: ""Unfortunately, since all of your loans are combined as one lender number per the Dept of Education, this is the only format we can send your payment history in."" 

Is it legal for them not to disclose my payment history by loan so that I may verify the interest rate reduction / payment schedule? Anyone have any advice how I should reply to them / what I should do?

personalfinance,Volt vs Prius,"Hello personal finance! I'm in the process of buying a new car and need some advice on hybrids/EVs.

I currently commute to work 5 days a week for 45 miles total. That means I drive 11700 miles to work every year. I also love to take road trips to see California and surrounding areas. So I put about 15k miles a year on my current car. The place I work at has a 240V charger so I could charge a plug-in hybrid for free. I don't think a fully electric car like a leaf would be a good choice for me since the range would not be suitable for long trips. 

I've been considering a Chevrolet Volt and a Toyota Prius C One. I've found the Prius on Truecar.com for $17k and the volt for $30k.  With a Volt, I will get a $7500 fed tax credit and another $1500 state credit. My brother works for GM so I would get an extra $1k taken off the asking price for the friends and family discount. Whereas the prius does not quality for any tax credits or additional discounts.

I'm trying to hold off on buying a car til the 2016 volt is released since it has a 50 mile range and I could charge it only at work. This would mean I would not have to pay for gas or electricity to power the car during the weekdays.

The prius gets 51mpg in the city and since I'm in Los Angeles it's mostly bumper to bumper driving anyways.

I currently make $65k a year and I have no debts. Rent is only $525. I can definitely afford to pay the higher monthly payments and if I purchased the Volt I would take the tax credits and apply it towards the principal of the car. I've already been approved for a car loan with 5% rate. I wrecked my credit rating a few years ago and I've been building it back up.

My question to you is, which of these two cars would be more economical?  Is it worth the initial higher cost to buy the Volt or in the long run will the Prius be a better buy?",finance,1426292518
personalfinance,Does it ever make sense to pay to establish credit history?,"I’ve read often in this sub that you should never pay to improve your credit history. What I’ve been advised elsewhere is contradictory, however, so I wonder if I might get more specific advice.

I’m 31 and don’t have a lot of history in the way of loans---I attended a state school on full scholarship, so no student loans. I have one credit card with a long history (used for everyday purchases and paid off in full each month), which I assume is why I have a good credit score. When I applied for a car loan a little over a year ago, my score was well over 800, which surprised both the dealer and me.

Because of this, I was eligible for a 0.99% rate for a 36-month loan for $12,000 (monthly payments of $340). I had and still have the money to pay this off in full without jeopardizing my emergency fund, but I was told that having a history of regularly paying an installment loan (as opposed to simple credit card history) would be beneficial in the future should I want to apply for a mortgage. My thought was that the ~$180 I’d pay in interest over the three-year loan would be money well spent to establish a stronger credit history. 

I’ve paid this loan off on time each month for the past 14 or so months, but now I read on this sub regularly that you should never pay to improve or establish credit. Am I doing this wrong? Should I pay the loan off tomorrow despite the low interest rate? (For what it’s worth, the money that I’d pay it off with is sitting in an online savings account making slightly less than the interest rate.) If, say, three or four years down the line I look into buying a house, will my credit history come up wanting if I don’t have a recent-ish installment loan on record?

investing,U.S. Energy producers ready for new wave of oil (from WSJ) - thoughts on oil? long &amp; short term?,"The ocean of oil from U.S. shale drove crude prices back toward six-year lows Friday, and American energy companies say they are poised to unleash a further flood that would keep prices from returning to lofty levels for a long time.


The International Energy Agency reinforced the prospect of a prolonged slump in energy prices Friday, saying U.S. oil output was surprisingly strong in February and rapidly filling all available storage tanks. The Paris-based energy watchdog said this could lead to another sharp drop in crude prices, which fell by about 50% late last year.


The report sent oil prices tumbling around the world, with the global benchmark Brent crude falling $2.41 to $54.67 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate lost $2.21 to settle at $44.84, less than 40 cents above a six-year low it reached in late January. Last summer, both traded well above $100.
It was only last month that the IEA said a price recovery seemed inevitable because the U.S. production boom was likely to cool. Instead, “U.S. supply so far shows precious little sign of slowing down,” the agency said Friday. “Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations.”


Independent shale-oil producers have slashed their planned 2015 spending on drilling by $50 billion, compared with last year’s, but have promised to increase production by focusing on their best oil fields. Total U.S. crude oil production hit a high of 9.4 million barrels a day in the week ended March 6, according to federal data.
Now many are adopting a new strategy that will allow them to pump even more crude as soon as oil prices begin to rise. They are drilling wells but holding off on hydraulic fracturing, or forcing in water and chemicals to free oil from shale formations. The delay in the start of fracking lets companies store oil in the ground in a way that enables them to tap it unusually quickly if they wish—and flood the market again.


This strategy could put a cap on how high oil prices can rise once they are recovering, said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc.


“We’re in slightly unexplored territory,” Mr. Morse said. “It’s an experiment—a big, big experiment.”
EOG Resources Inc., an oil producer based in Texas, is drilling about 285 wells that it won’t start finishing off until crude oil’s price rebounds to between $60 and $65 a barrel.


“When oil prices recover, EOG will be prepared to resume strong double-digit oil growth,” Chief Executive Bill Thomas said recently.


Some other big names in U.S. energy also are delaying well completions, among them Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Apache Corp., Chesapeake Energy Corp. and Continental Resources Inc. These four plus EOG pumped 312 million barrels of oil in the U.S. in 2014, or almost 10% of American crude production.


The number of wells in Texas and North Dakota that have been drilled but aren’t yet pumping is at least 3,000, RBC Capital Markets estimates. That oil still in the ground “provides a war chest that could temper fundamental price spikes in the coming year,” RBC analyst Scott Hanold wrote in a Friday note.


This essentially is more U.S. crude in storage, akin to that in the tanks now brimming. The U.S. has 449 million barrels of oil sloshing around in tanks, the highest level on record and almost 70% of capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.


Even so, Jim Krane, an energy fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, questioned whether U.S. producers would be able to adjust oil production as quickly as, for instance, Saudi Arabia has proved able to do in the past. “We’ll probably have more price volatility because even as nimble as shale is, it’s not as nimble as OPEC,” he said. The shale producers “can’t just go out and turn a valve.”


It isn’t as though the price plunge hasn’t affected production.


The number of oil rigs drilling in the U.S. declined by 56 this week to 866, a 46% drop since early October when oil was traded for about $90 a barrel, according to oilfield-service company Baker Hughes Inc. Some production cutbacks are starting to materialize.


North Dakota regulators said Thursday the state’s oil output declined 3% in January from the record level reached in December.

Market observers have been waiting for U.S. shale production to cool down since November, when Saudi Arabia said it would keep pumping oil at high levels to preserve its own customer base. Some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said at the time that the move would force American producers to cut pumping because their oil is relatively expensive to produce.


U.S. companies aren’t necessarily looking to fill OPEC’s shoes as the so-called swing producer that can adjust production to help set price levels.


For many, delaying oil production from drilled wells is a financial decision; finishing off a well and putting it into service accounts for 60% of the well’s total price.


By pushing off that expense, companies hope they can earn more from higher oil prices once they finally do pump and sell their crude. They also are expecting their costs will fall as oilfield-service providers vie for their business.


Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources Inc., a producer in North Dakota, has urged peers to hold off on completing as many wells as possible.


Continental is waiting to hook up 127 already-drilled wells, postponing up to $1 million in spending apiece.
“Save that money,” Mr. Hamm said recently.


“Avoid selling that production in this poor market and wait for service costs to fall before completing those wells. Most people are doing that,” he said.

gaming,"Forbidden techniques in Hearthstone that requires inhuman amount of APM, how many have you mastered?","Disclaimer: These are the forbidden techniques I discovered in various Hearthstone forums. I haven't seen most of them discussed here so I would like to share.

**No. 10: Turn 10 double Venture Co.**

This is a very practical technique that requires a medium amount of APM (action per minute). Just drag two Venture Co.s one after the other immediately. A very good introduction to those who want to master higher level APM techniques.

APM required: &gt;200.

**No. 9: Double BGH opponent's double Stormwind Champions.** 

This one is a little harder in the sense that it requires some mouse precision. And since very few constructed decks have two Stormwind Champions, this technique might see more practical use in Arena.

APM required: &gt;220.

**NO.8 (Mage only) Ping Nobel Sacrifice**

The exact moment ""GET DOWN"" is triggered, ping him with your hero power BEFORE your minion hit him. A very useful technique to get a one card advantage against Paladins.

APM Required：&gt;240

**NO.7 Double Arguses Double Shields**

If you think this one is as ez as No.10, you are just a noob and need to get gud. The catch is that you need to drop the second Argus the moment the first's battlecry triggers. (Protip, the first Argus will blink.) Timing is very essential in this technique and can get you two 3/4 Arguses with taunts from an empty board.

APM required：&gt;260

**NO.6 Double Shattered Sun Clerics buff each other**

This is one whole new level compared to NO. 7. If you drag the first Cleric on your board but cancel the buff process by right clicking, the Cleric will bounce back to your hand after a very short delay. Now before she bounces back immediately drag the second Cleric to buff the first one, then immediately drag the first one to buff the second one. All these have to be down before the first Cleric bounces to your hand. Same technique can be applied to double argent protectors.

APM Required：&gt;300

**NO.5 (Paladin Only) Pick two out of four or more your opponent's minion using MTC, brewmaster and consecrate**

If you have mastered the first 5 and are ready for this one or above, then congratulations, your APM is well above average pros. These are also mandatory trainings every pros have to undertake everyday. You still haven't seen these in tournaments because very few are confident to show it off.

Now on to this classic paladin alley oop maneuver. Consecrate to throw your opponent's minions in the air. Drop your MTC and drag one of his minions to your side. Combo with brewmaster and drag the second minion. All these have to be done before the minions fall back to the board. Legend says that if you have enough strength you can even drag enemy hero for OTK.

APM required：&gt;340

**NO.4 Mad Bomber suicide**

This one has absolutely no practical use and is only developed for maximum BM.

Drop Bomber and trigger three bombs. Brewmaster bomber and identify the drop locations of the bombs while they are still in air. Place the same bomber onto those locations to suicide. Sometimes you also need to utilize the minion swapping bug. (I believe every player before Naxx must have seen this bug. It turns out this is not a bug but a feature that encourages high APM. ) APM Required：&gt;360

**NO.3 (Warlock Only) Doomguard + double Soulfires**

This one requires one to feel the discard locations of the Soulfires. With enough belief in the heart of cards, one can catch those Soulfires like butterflies before they vanish and fling them to your opponent's face.
APM Required: &gt;400

**NO.2 (Warlock Only) Turn 4 double Mountain Giants**

I believe every handlock player now knows this already. Simply put, when you go 2nd, tap on turn 2 and turn 3. Right before you draw the 11th card on turn 4, drop two mountain giants.

However there is an advanced version of this technique. Tap right before you overdraw on turn 4. The client will think you have 12 cards and you can drop 1-cost mountain giants with the remaining mana.   

APM Required：&gt;450

**NO.1 (Hunter Only) Wild Pyromancer + UTD**

The basics of this technique is such a common knowledge that I don't want to overstate. The higher your APM is, the more value you can get from this combo. It can also bypass most taunts in the game with Hunter's Mark.

However, the pinnacle of this technique, and of all these forbidden APM techniques, is sealed forever by Blizzard because it was way too overpowered. Yes, you have guessed right.

personalfinance,"One year until we apply for a mortgage, how can we bolster our application when my s/o is self-employed?","As I mentioned, my fiance and I are looking to buy a house when our lease ends this time next year. We live in a very competitive market and want to bolster our application with anything we can. We will be married for 6 months when we apply.

Myself: Mid 20's female with a steady job in tech at the same company for 3 years, track record of promotions and raises, currently making 65k and expect to see an annual raise in October. I have a master's from a top 10 school if that matters for anything (I like to lie to myself and pretend that matters). 

Him: Early 30's male. He's an artist and makes about 65k a year (15k is on a 1099 from his shop owner, the rest we claim in cash), but has many deductions for our home office/supplies/etc. His net usually comes out around 35-40k and we pay our taxes on time. Tax returns show year over year growth of around 15% for the last three years, with this year already on track for that growth as well.

We have 15k now saved for a downpayment and expect to be in the low 20s by next year. Houses that we are looking at are from 180-270k.

We both have 740+ credit scores and &lt;25% credit utilization. We have 10k in credit cards left but expect that to be paid off in the next 2-3 months. I have 19k on a federal student loan being paid ahead and he has 10k on a car note (2011 model). My car (2011 model)  is paid off and we have no other debt. Our monthly minimums are 800 between both of us but will be 500 once the credit cards are gone.

S/O is a veteran but we know how hard VA loans are to get and his service record, while qualifying, wasn't highly exemplary (dumb 18-year old things). We plan on applying for pre-qualification but are not counting on it to be safe. We also live in a very competitive market and know VA loans sometimes are not attractive to sellers. Some houses never even make it to the MLS here. 

In addition to tax forms, what else can we collect to help make sure being self-employed is not a problem? We have paid 1600 a month for rent for the last 3 years and never missed a payment (verified with bank payments), would that be something that lenders take into account? Anything other than tax forms, letters from his owner verifying his income, etc? Anything else we can be doing in the next year other than squirreling away money and protecting our credit scores? Should we try to find a real estate agent with experience working with 1099-misc clients?

personalfinance,94K student loan payoff plan,"I am a longtime lurker in r/personalfinance, and I thought I'd finally work up the courage to post about my situation to see if my plan of attack is solid :). 

**My education background**

I graduated with a Master's degree in May of 2014. In addition to my second lovely piece of paper, I held 105k of student debt (97k Federal, 10.5k private through Chase). I don't feel that my degree was a waste of money, what I do is actually weirdly specific and relatively high in demand (my two degrees together actually made me a perfect candidate for my job, but I wouldn't have landed it w/o the graduate degree boosting my credentials).

**Current Job/Financial State**

I started at my job in July (was hired in April before graduating). I make $57,500 with great benefits (and I love, love, love it!). I have no credit card debt, just student loans. 

Luckily my job is in Atlanta, so I have the benefit of living with my family. It's great in every way except for the 1hr commute each way, but that is something I have to live with in order to be debt free in a reasonable amount of time :). My monthly take home pay (after 10% 401K contribution and insurance) is $3,060. My budgeted expenses each month are: 

* Cell phone plan $65
* Car insurance $98
* Netflix $8
* Groceries $140
* Misc spending (eating out/oil change/any unexpected things) $150
* Savings account $250
* Gas $150
* Student Loans: $2,200

**My plan of attack**

I'm currently on the extended graduated plan, so my monthly payments are $699 on my federal loans. I pay $100 per month on my Chase private loan, and I put the remaining $1400 on the highest interest (Graduate Plus loan). When I graduated that one was about 21K, and I've already drilled it down to 8k! I should be getting a 5% raise in July w/a promotion which should give me another $200 per month to pay on my loans, and in my career path I should jump 20K in 2.5 years if I switch companies (this is on the advice of my supervisor/mentor). 


My questions about my plan is

* a) At what point do you think I can financially manage to leave my family's house and still be able to work towards being debt free. I love living here, but Atlanta traffic 20hrs a week is a nightmare. I'm debating trying to move on my own when I reach 45k (01/2017) or waiting until it's down to 30K (estimated 09/2017). I'm 27, and I don't want to be living here when I'm 30. I also feel I'm not going to meet anyone living out in the boonies.

* b) I contribute 10% to my 401K (I already have about $4,900 in there). I've debated cutting my contribution down and applying that to the student loans, but I'm not sure if that's wise :/.

* c) Should I be putting my $250 in savings towards attacking my loan? I hate feeling like I'm not saving anything. 

* d) Any other advice?",finance,1426352737
personalfinance,"Starting to think about buying a home, help me make good decisions.","Hi, and thanks for reading, throwaway b/c of the personal info.
I am 24(f) my husband is 27.  We are starting to discuss buying a home for the first time.  I am going to try to include as much relevant info as possible, any advice welcome. 

First relevant information: we moved to the Denver area June 2014.  In Denver right now, rents are skyrocketing in general, costs of homes are also increasing.  The city and surrounding suburbs are growing. In many situations, rents are higher than mortgage payments.  Since we want to stay in the area, this is a factor in our decision.

Our current financials: Income
Me: $32,350 + bonuses (range $200/month- 700/month &amp; profit sharing)

Husband: $37,000 + regular overtime (additional $200/month minimum)
[I'm expecting a small raise next week due to annual reviews, but any additional income like bonuses and overtime we are careful not to be reliant upon- since they are not guaranteed]

Debt/ Expenses:
Student Loans:

Me- Total Balance: $14,508.66

$4548.37 – 6.5% interest (fixed)

$9960.29 – 3.15% interest (fixed)

[original monthly payments were $150 spread equally across, I changed payment plans so monthly amount due is $88, and put at least $65 additional toward the loan with higher interest monthly.]

Husband- Total Balance: 17,353.20

$2024.34 – 5.6 interest (fixed)

$4333.55 – 3.86 interest ( fixed)

$8325.69 – 3.4 interest (fixed)

[current monthly payment is $200.00 – looking to change to payment plan similar to mine, and make higher payment on higher interest loans)

Vehicle Debt:

$16,000 at 4.5%

monthly payment $324.00

(pay half of monthly payment every other week, instead of monthly)

OTHER: 
$450 – in collections [long story short – I was on a lease with a friend- sublet my room summer 2011- they did not leave the apartment in good condition- friend said he would pay the debt, saved up to do so for a year – spent the money on an engagement ring instead for his gf – starting saving to pay debt again – he committed suicide.  I contacted collections and offered a pay to remove- they said they would look into it and that the person who could make that decision was not there- never got back to me] I did not initiate contact again out of fear of dealing with them – any advice welcome.



Current Set Monthly Expenses:
Rent $850 (extremely low compared to current market – hoping we don't see an increase on new lease in June)

Utilities: Winter ($130)  Summer ($70-80)

Car Insurance: $100

Credit:

Husband is 670

Mine is 650 (just paid off CC that was which had a high balance on it- was negatively affecting score- should increase score slightly soon)

So, we are starting to consider and set a time-line for our first home purchase.  We are confident that we'd like a townhome.  In our area, townhomes in the areas we want range from $140k to 250k – more specifically – we are looking at homes in the 180k range.  


I feel pretty lost looking at all the information.  Doing a mortgage estimator with our income and debt says we can “afford” a $250k mortgage.  (obviously not interested in spending near that much)


As far as a down payment – we are fortunate that my parents are contributing 10k towards a down payment.  Ideally we will be matching that (at least).  However, if the stars align- we would be moving forward on a home by June (lease ending, landlord will only do month-to-month if we have a specific reason/plan) or else holding off til next June, 2016 – which would affect our down payment.


My specific questions:
1) Are we able to consolidate our debt using the mortgage? For instance- taking out a higher loan amount and paying off the loans we have currently with higher interest rates?

2) As mentioned – we moved here in June.  We both have consistent employment records, but have only been in our current positions since August – is this going to compromise our eligibility for a loan? If I find a better position (better paying) that is not in my current industry – will it be worse for eligibility?

3) Are we being realistic, in general? Our credit scores aren't ideal – the down payment is on the low end

If there's any information that I should have included that I missed – please let me know.

personalfinance,Does my mother have any idea what she is doing?,"First time poster here, and I'm in a bit of a dilemma. 

Background: 
So my mom is the type of person who is always coming up with grand schemes, some of them very well thought out, others not so much. On top of that, she's fairly fed up with her career (nursing) and is in a bit of an introspective phase, thinking about what she really wants, as far as a career, and retirement with my dad, and so on. Today she pitched a pretty in depth idea to my sister (26) and I (17) and I honestly have to admit I have so little knowledge about this kind of finance I was fairly intimidated by the whole proposition. I'm here on reddit because I want to be able to understand what parents are doing and maybe even council them in some capacity. 

The Scenario: 
Alright, so a lot of the plan centers around my grandmother, who is finally starting to slow down due to age and is looking to move closer to where my family and I live. She's been looking for a house for a while now, and just recently we learned that the house next to ours (we have a good relationship with the current owners) will be for sale for roughly $400k. The house meets all of my grandmother's criteria, with the exception of price. She's not at a place in her life (she's 75) that she wants to take on another mortgage, and she only has about half the price of this house to spend. This is where my mother's idea comes in. She's proposing that my father and her take on the additional cost of the new property, mortgage the new house, and essentially double the property they own. The mortgage on the current house is almost paid off, so paying for two mortgages wouldn't be a problem, so I'm told. In addition to that, my mother was proposing that we move into the new house and rent out the old, at least at first. Now here's where I'm confused/worried/uneducated. I'm planning on going to 4-year university soon, and even with some scholarship money I expect to receive, I'm fairly certain we as a family need to leave ourselves some wiggle room for the time being, because the cost connected to college is still a huge question mark. I'll list whatever helpful numbers I can below, but basically what I'm asking is if there is any sense to what my mother is proposing and if we can really get what we want from this situation. Sorry for the wall o' text.

Fun Facts: 
- Mortgage on current house is almost paid for 
- Adjacent house for sale - $400k 
- Grandma has ~$200k to drop on new house
- Parents make, as far as I can figure, about $130k a year as a unit
- Impending 4 year college tuition (most likely instate)
- Brother (13) most likely going to college as well
- Mom is hoping to rent old house for $1,000ish per/mo
- Grandma will have no income, I'm assuming",finance,1426355799

My boyfriend just got accepted to vet school (yay!). We were planning on getting married after he graduates and we have settled somewhere. But I was wondering if it would be financially prudent to be married before he starts. Stats:

He will make very little while in school - maybe 10-20k during summers. I currently make ~70k and am expecting it to increase to near 100k within a year or so. Originally I thought not being married would allow him access to more grants, etc., but I then learned that for grad school the only federal assistance you can get is unsubsidized (aka 6.8%) loans. Thus due to our very different incomes the marriage bonus could easily net us $5k+ in tax savings per year. Furthermore, I was thinking that I could also reduce my tax liability by putting money into a 529 with him as the beneficiary (this does not necessarily require us to be married, but that would probably make it easier to not worry about gift tax limits, etc). 

Am I missing anything? Does that make financial sense? FYI I am already maxing out all retirement accounts (401K + IRA + HSA) and contribute 500-1000$ after tax, so 529 seems like the next best tax liability reducer I could use. 

Thanks!

personalfinance,Is this debt going to be worth it?,"Hey everyone, I've been lurking around here for a while now and I feel as if this is the right place to ask this. This does concern future student loan debt, so if I'm posting this in the wrong place please let me know.

Background: I'm a high school senior who is set on going for an engineering degree. I'm currently stuck between two colleges and it's a huge financial struggle to pick one. My parents are willing to contribute about 10k per year. If we do get a loan, we would most likely take a Home Equity Line of Credit (not sure if that's the right  name for it) which would be at around 3% rather than federal loans which would be around 7.41%. While my parents would take everything on them (technically), I would in the end pay them back for everything, interest and all.

Option 1 is an in-state college which would cost around 35k per year and is offering a total of 40k in scholarships. Total student loan debt for that school would be around 60k after factoring in scholarships and parent contribution. However the school did mention that if I remained in the program I applied for, they would be willing to give more scholarships in the future which would decrease this amount as well.

Option 2 is an out of state college costing 45k per year. It is also my dream school and one which I know I would flourish at. While it is out of state, it is also the 2nd best in the country for the program which I want to go for meaning it will have better job opportunities. They will most likely offer 5k a year (not sure yet, but that is the most probable) so after everything the student debt would be around 120k. I can also, like the other college, apply for more scholarships after my freshmen year.

I understand that these are already HUGE amounts of debt. However I also know that a college education is a good investment, especially for engineering. As long as I maintain good grades (which I believe I am able to) I should graduate with a job of around 60k-75k. The industry is very stable. I am also hoping on landing a co-op or internship which are paid for engineers, helping my student debt. I have also applied to a couple small scholarships. Thanks to the advice that I've read on this subreddit, I think as long as I follow a strict budget this debt will be easily handled.

I was wondering what your opinions on whether or not taking on a debt twice as large as another one is a good idea or not. Obviously, financially it doesn't seem like it. However, I really think that it would be okay if it is properly managed and kept a close eye on. Please let me know your advice! If you have any other questions let me know!

personalfinance,Data based retirement planning (AUS) - spreadsheet inside!,"One of the biggest problems I've had planning for my retirement is that:

1. its not easy to figure out how much wealth I will have needed to accumulate at the point of retirement, and

2. even if I had this figure, its not easy to figure out how much I need to put aside each year or even week to achieve that.

Because this is difficult, a lot of people revert to an 'as much as possible' mindset, but that doesn't make for much of a life, nor a sense of freedom to be generous to others with my money. I know of the rule of thumb, that is to save 15% of your income, but this seems to be a bit of a blunt instrument that doesn't account for career changes, dropping from 2 incomes to 1 for a period of having children, difficulties for self employed for whom money comes in bursts, etc. 

I decided I wanted to know the answers to the 2 questions above, so I embarked on an exercise, involving this spreadsheet, which you can access here:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/2xa0kp4egm8ir4t/Saving%20Amount%20Comparison%20plus%20Retirement%20Spending%20Phase.xlsx?dl=0

All figures are based on Australian dollars, and an Australian economy. I am 34, nearly 35, and I am  planning on a retirement anywhere between 60 and 70 (by the time I'm 70, 70 will be the legislated retirement age when I can access Super). I own my home outright, and have no debts. I have $25K in savings, and I expect to have $800K - $1M in Super by retirement age.

Firstly, I wanted to know what dollar figure I needed to reach by retirement. This is sheet 1 of the spreadsheet. The 3 figures to play with are the cost of living, inflation rate and interest rate. Because I put all of my living expenses on a single credit card (and pay it off in full each month!) I have an easy means of quantifying this. My annual cost of living at the moment is approx $55,000, but I rounded up to $60,000 to be conservative. The inflation rate of the Australian economy over the last 20 years has been 2.9%. And I felt that by the time I hit retirement I'd want my investments to be in a relatively conservative holding, and that 6% would be achievable without excessive risk.

Sheet 1 of the spreadsheet works by doing 2 things - indexing a 2015-equivalent cost of living out to the rest of my life (left side) and then presenting 3 scenarios in the coloured columns - retiring at 60, 65 and 70. The columns show what happens if I were to hit retirement with different figures - $1M, $1.5M etc., basically showing how long before I run out of money. The idea is to choose a capital amount that means you don't run out for your given cost of living.

Once I had this figure, I then went to sheet 2 of the spreadsheet, which evaluates 2 different things: a different amount of annual saving (which is then inflation-indexed year on year), and different investment growth rates. The left hand columns are all working columns, and when a different annual amount is plugged into the top left (yellow), it shows the outcome of different investment growth rates. This outcome is summarised in the green box on the right - essentially if a given amount was invested until 60, 65 or 70 what the outcome would be at the different interest rates. Below the green box are the results of particular tests I have already run - i.e. saving $5k, $10k, $15k and $20k per year.

So essentially the user can look at the 4 pastel coloured boxes and, after deciding what growth rate they feel comfortable to expect, and when they would like to retire, can choose an annual saving amount required to meet their financial goal. If this annual amount is too high, the growth rate needs to be increased or the retirement age needs to be extended, and vice versa if the saving amount is very easily managed.

What becomes evident from sheet 1 is that with my cost of living, combined with that inflation rate and that investment growth rate, I need to amass $2.5M to not run out of money before death, which will hopefully be 90-odd. This means on top of my Super, I need an additional $1.5 - $2M.

Transferring this over to sheet 2, it becomes evident that if I feel confident to expect an investment growth rate between 6-8% (which I am), if I save $15k per year (and then this amount indexed to follow inflation) I could possibly retire at 60, and almost certainly by 65.

So the long and the short of it? I need to start transferring $288/week (let's all it $300) into an interest savings account (4%) which I can then start putting towards investments once the amount is big enough to do so (i.e. deposit on an investment apartment, index fund investing etc.)

One obvious, glaring oversight is the complete lack of incorporation of tax, but because I have no idea of how tax in these kind of scenarios works yet, I decided that simply overestimating the amount I need to reach would at least help, at least until I get a better understanding. One option suggested to me is to do all of this through a self managed super fund, but I dunno ...

Would love to get your thoughts/feedback, but otherwise I hope this exercise might be able to help others to really pin down how much to put aside each week to achieve a decent standard of retirement.",finance,1426404203

personalfinance,Recent grad with low income needs advice,"Hi, r/personalfinance! I recently got my first full-time paid job out of college, and I could really use your help.

I’m a reporter at a small daily newspaper. I've wanted to be a journalist for as long as I can remember, and I absolutely love my job. However, entry-level pay in this field isn't terribly high, and I'm not sure how best to manage my finances with my limited income. Here's what I'm working with:

**Monthly income after taxes: $1600/month**

Monthly expenses:  
**Rent and utilities: $350.** This is very cheap for the area, and I live with three roommates to cut down on costs.  
**Student loans: $212.** This is the minimum monthly payment on a 10-year plan (more on the loans later).  
**Auto insurance: $120.** Used to be lower, but I got into a pretty bad car accident a year ago and it doubled. I’ve been a ridiculously careful driver ever since, so I’m hoping the rates will go back down in two years.   
**Food: $100.** Basically consists of bread, lunch meat, cheese, fruit, vegetables, eggs, tofu, soy milk and vitamins.  
**Gas: $60.** There isn't much in the way of public transportation out here, and I have to be able to travel anywhere in the county at a moment's notice. Gas prices are extremely cheap, fortunately, and I try to walk whenever I can.  
**Phone bill: $45.** My field requires me to have a cellphone.  
**Miscellaneous: $50.** Netflix, oil changes, occasional meal out, etc.  
**Total monthly expenses: $937**

Current debts:  
**Credit card debt: $300.** I have two credit cards, one with an $8000 limit and one with a $1000 limit. The $300 is on the second card, and the first one has no balance. I've never missed a payment, and if MyFico is to be believed, I have an acceptable credit score (748).  
**Student loan debt: $20,500** All federal Stafford loans, thank goodness. I've been making minimum monthly payments for three months, since I didn't have a full-time job when the grace period ended, but I'm planning on paying much more than the minimum now.  
**Total debts: $20,800**

Current savings:  
**Emergency fund: $2000.** I keep it in a savings account.  
**CD: $3000.** This is scheduled to mature in June or July.  
**Total savings: $5000 (but only $2000 currently accessible)**

Other information: The car was paid for in full, so I have no regular payments other than auto insurance. I also plan to stay on my father's health insurance for a few years (I'm currently 22). I have a younger sibling who's also on the plan, and the cost of insuring two children is the same as insuring one child. So staying on the plan doesn't affect my parents' finances at all. I do have the option of getting insurance through the paper, but it's a bit pricey for my income and doesn't leave much money left over for savings. 

Here's my tentative plan. I'll have an extra $660/month after expenses. $250/month will be earmarked for my 401K (I become eligible for the plan after a year on the job). $340/month will go toward student loan payments (in addition to the minimum $212/month payments). At that rate, I should be able to pay off the loans in a little over three years. That's when I'll turn 26 and get dropped from my father's coverage, so I'd be in a much better position to afford health insurance. The remaining $70/month or so will initially go toward paying off my credit card; once that's done, I'll start adding the money to my emergency savings. And, of course, if I find places to cut costs in my budget, I'll contribute that money as well. 

Is this feasible? I'd love any advice I can get...I'm starting to think I'll need some sort of side income, but my hours are so unpredictable that I can't do anything with a set schedule.

investing,Thoughts on the markets for next week? What say you reddit?,"good morning all! hope you all are enjoying your weekend. :)

so, i just wanted to put this chart up real quick in here this morning while i had a few minutes, as i wanted to get some market insights from you good folks here at this subreddit.

* chart --&gt; http://i.imgur.com/MARfwif.png

just to give y'all a quick recap of last week's market action-

it was yet another volatile week in the markets, as my ""indices"" chart would illustrate, but it wasn't all negative out there as the risky small caps russell 2000 actually ended the week higher by +1.20%, while the other majors were all lower by -0.50% or greater.

you had 2 defensive sectors in the s&amp;p 500 higher this past week (*health care and utilities*) while the financials (*an offensive sector*) were a bright spot.

currencies were pretty much inline with the prior week's action in the sense that they were all more or less trading down against the greenback across the board ... with the euro really accelerating its losses in a biiiiiig way this past week ... wowzers has that thing been in free fall mode!

in the commodities we had metals not really getting much of any lift at all this past week, just going sideways if anything following the prior week's thrashing (*which i guess is not too bad given the surge we've seen in the greenback*), while we saw a significant decline in the crude oil, which is now approaching new 6-year lows in fact! boy has that thing just fallen out of bed this past week after breaching the $48 handle on the downside! that looks to me like it wants much lower prices (*sub-$40 anyone???*) from here ... what do you all think?

treasuries were all higher across the board (*meaning lower yields*) last week, but not by too much.

what is interesting to me in all of this volatility, is the vix (*get it, volatility? erm...nvm bad joke there lol*) the vix has barely budged during much of this market sell off ... we haven't really seen the big spike in the volatility index as one would usually assume to be the case accompanying market sell offs ... that being said though, i don't know that one can actually make too much from just this one indicator alone, but that was certainly something that had caught my eye when viewing some of the charts this weekend and thought to bring it up for discussion in here as well...

so, putting that all aside now, we can look forward onto next week -- and boy is next week going to be a doozy of a week!

we have a number of important econ. numbers coming out, but more importantly we have the all important fomc meeting announcement (*w/ a yellen press conference*) on wednesday!

why is this fed meeting so important than previous meetings? whelp, unless you have been living under a rock the past couple of weeks, you will know that this meeting could be the meeting where the fed signals that it is ready to move on interest rate hikes sooner rather than later (*preferably in june*) ... and the one thing traders will be watching in this particular statement will be the wording ""**patient**"" and if that is still present in the statement or not ...

most investors believe that if there is no ""**patient**"" in the language of next week's fed statement, then that could be the signal to the markets that the fed may in fact be ""thinking"" about moving in june ... now this is all just assuming of course, but it is interesting to see the market reaction in front of this very important fed meeting.

i mean if you just take a look at what the u.s. dollar has done and how that has been moving the past weeks, it would seem to me anyway that it is pricing something of a rate hike in a few months, no?

same could be said with the equity markets to an extent, where the markets have been trading down on positive news, and vice versa (*up on bad news*).

you guys tell me, but when you look at that u.s. dollar index chart, is that not overdone on the upside or what? while the euro on the other hand overdone on the downside?

anyway, enough of me writing! this thread was meant to get some opinions from all of you for next week ... but i just wanted to give y'all the quick rundown on the prior week's action, and what to expect for the week ahead next week.

what do you guys think? will we see any change in the fed's language come wednesday? or will the statement still be dovish as all hell as it's been for months and years on end ...

let's hear what some of you have to say on this...

thx, and i hope you all enjoy the rest of your weekend.

looking forward to hearing some of your insights in here!

**edit:** also, and not to get too technical in here, but i thought this spx daily chart was interesting to share here as well.

so, if you connect a trend line from the oct. 2014 lows to the lows in february, we're finding support at that area now and have been bouncing off of that the past couple of sessions ... as well as some resistance from the two january tops ... and price is also battling that 50sma ... so a pretty important area here i would think ... we're essentially right back in that choppy range that we've been in for much of 2015 right now ... should be interesting to see what happens with this, for this upcoming week ahead.",finance,1426416049
Banking,A question about Interest Rates risks,"Hi, I'm starting studying Risk Management in Banking and I'm struggling with a basic example. Hope you can help:

&gt; Let’s take a 10-year fixed rate mortgage of 100,000 euros at 6 %.
&gt; 
&gt; To finance this investment the bank issues a 1-year certificate of deposit of the same amount with a 2 % fixed rate. The net interest income (NII) of this operation is 4 % of the total amount: 4,000 euros.
&gt; 
&gt; Assume that during the year market interest rates rise by 1%. When the certificate of deposit matures, the bank will be obliged to refinance the mortgage by issuing a new CD at a higher rate (3 %), though it’s still getting a 6 % return on its investment. So, the NII would shrink from 4 % to 3 % of the investment).

I assumed that the initial CD was at 100,000e, and it got repaid at 2% after a year, why did the rising interest rate during the first year affect the bank's ROI since the mortgage and CDs where at fxed-rate? What I'm I missing?

The decline of the Canadian dollar is beneficial to the company, and while this could work against them at some point in the future, it does not look like it will be a concern any time soon with the U.S. fed gearing up to raise rates.

I'll try to avoid a wall of text. Context up top, questions at the bottom:

I am 27 and I make **$72,500** a year in a high cost-of-living city. I fully expect to receive a small bump in pay sometime in May, bringing me anywhere from $76k - $82k.

1) One FEDERAL: Remaining balance of **$19,652.57**. Fixed rate of **5.875%**. Monthly payment of **$154.64**

2) One PRIVATE: Remaining balance of **$28,070.54**. I feel stupid for not knowing but I believe the rate is variable (assuming this because it is private) and it is currently at **5%**. Monthly payment of **$217.87**. Don't worry, I've just sent an email to them to figure out the deal with the interest rate!

3) Another PRIVATE: Remaining balance of **$35,921.03. **Variable rate of **2.86%**, tied to LIBOR. Monthly payment of **$253.81**.

First time posting on reddit! Hope this is the right subreddit to discuss this. 

My wife and I just purchased a condo loan with 20% down in November with loan amount of 440k. 
Loan terms were fixed 30year with rate of 4.7%

He wants to refinance to start at 6 months (the earliest you can refinance a new mortgage) at a rate of 4.6%

On the initial loan, we took a higher interest rate for the ""kickback"". The bank paid us to take a higher interest rate at the end of the loan. That covered loan costs and gave us some money at the end of the mortgage (I believe $4,000). 

If we take this new refinance, it will net us ~$7000 after everything is paid out.
He recommends taking the new loan and using the pay back towards the principal or using it for renovations (kitchen needs remodel). It would drop our monthly payment $30. 

Initially we were ok with taking higher interest rate because we needed the money up front, and didn't expect keeping the place over 10 years which is how long it would have taken for the lower interest rate to exceed the payout. 

He wants to refinance right away, saying he thinks interest rates will start to rise soon.

2) Will it be harder to get a loan consolidation when times are good (ie. when interest rates are higher)?

personalfinance,"About to get a re-enlistment bonus, should I pay off my car, or stash the money away?","Hello there, I had tried to use the search button to find a similar issue as mine but the one I did find was much better off than me (he had no debt, had a house, etc.) 

I have roughly 6,000 in credit card debt, and about 20,000 on my car loan. I'd say after taxes my bonus would be close to 20,000 dollars, possibly less. My car payments are about $360 a month. 

Would it be wise to pay off my credit cards and whatever I have left, have it go to my car? then pay off my car as soon as I can? I have a motorcycle I've been meaning to sell, I'll probably get about 6,000 dollars for that, which will probably go to paying off the car as well. 

I guess my question is, should I pay all of this off, be debt free, then start saving? I'm single with two dogs and a possibly a fiancee down the road but that's still a little iffy. 

I was thinking after I pay this off I can still pretend to have a car payment and stash those 360 dollars a month into something. 


Update: 

Sorry, my interest rate on my car is 3.4%, as with my credit cards, 

I owe 3,800 on one credit card but I believe it's interest free for 11 more months.

personalfinance,Is debt consolidation a good thing?,"I have two personal loans that I am currently paying $173 and $161 a month on.

I'm paying $90+ a month to interest on both loans and have barely scratched the surface of the original principle balance. I considered consolidation for a while just so I can get a better interest rate and one payment a month, but I'm worried that the combined amount I would have to pay off would come with a larger monthly payment and maybe a higher interest rate. Is consolidation a smart avenue to take, or should I save and do a lump-sum payoff? The loan amounts are $2999 and $4100 approximately, you probably need to know that information.

personalfinance,Take out graduate student loans to cover high rate undergrad loans?,"My girlfriend finished undergrad with about $25k in student loans - unfortunately, she received poor advice from her mother and ended up taking out private loans through Sallie Mae even though she would've qualified for federal loans.  Therefore, she ended up with rates that ranged from 8.75-9.35%.  

She has been out of school for 2 years, working and gaining experience in the field she will be going back to school for.   She's been able to knock out a good chuck of her loans (paying the highest rate loans first), but when she starts school, she'll still have roughly $5-7k left (most, if not all, will be at the 8.75% rate), which will accrue interest while she's in grad school.  

She's going to need student loans to finance her graduate studies, and we're currently trying to decide how much she should take out.  She is going to need the max federal unsubsidized Stafford loan allowed per year ($20.5k), plus additional loans.  The option that makes the most sense is an unsubsidized ""institutional loan"" that is offered by the school she will be attending - it will have a 6.0% interest rate, no loan origination fee, as well as some benefits federal loans have (extended/graduated repayment plans, deferment due to loss of job/economic hardship, no prepayment penalty).  This is better than the Graduate PLUS loans (7.21% rate with a 4.292% origination fee).

Given circumstances, should she take out an extra $5-7k in institutional loans to pay for her undergraduate loans?  The rate will effectively drop by 2.75%, which over the course of the three years she's in school will save her $500-600.  Any reason not to do it?",finance,1426457416

personalfinance,I'm 17 and am applying for my first job. What should I expect?,"EDIT: All my listed questions have been answered, thanks everyone! I will continue to check this, so feel free to contribute anything extra.

I'm applying to a local grocer to push carts and/or stock shelves. 

Do I need a bank account? Will I be taxed even though I'm a dependent? If so, how? How should I save/spend? I'm still in high school (Class of 2015), so I'll be working part time. I want this job for spending money. How will being a minor affect me? I turn 18 after I graduate.

EDIT: I'm double majoring next year, so I'll quit this job in August, probably. Once I start college, I would rather focus on my studies and graduation in a reasonable amount of time than having extra spending money. My parents worked in college and hated it (in fact, they met working together at Red Lobster), so they'll expect this and be okay with it. 

Description of my situation and why I want a job: I have not told my parents, they're opposed to the idea of me getting a job. They think I should just do more around the house and have them pay me. But this does not work because 1. There is only so much housework and cleaning to be done. 2. I hate cleaning, would much rather push carts. 3. I already clean (well, sometimes) for free. And 4. I want more money than they have to give me. I know this sounds greedy, but I have good reasons.

My dad is going to lose his job in the near future (the business is shutting down, it was small and his boss is ready to retire) so we don't know where we'll be financially in a year. It's possible my parents will be paying to have 3 kids in college at once on one income. (They're doing their best to keep us away from student loans, bless them.) They're trying to save up and prepare for the worst, and it's noticeable.

It isn't uncommon for my mom to run out of cash and need to borrow from my savings (which is just birthday and christmas money, a couple hundred dollars). I can tell she struggles to pay me back sometimes. EDIT: This isn't an actual savings account. It's a pouch with glitter and sequins on it stuffed with cash, and is in a secret hiding place.

I feel guilty asking for money as it is, I would feel even worse if I took my mom's last $40 because I did housework. 

We aren't poor by any means, we're just a middle class family with a lot of necessary spending (college, mortgage, etc.) I want to buy myself stuff (I need a new purse, new socks, etc) but I can't get more then $20 from my mom at a time.

So that's my justification for getting a job against my parents' wishes.",finance,1426460325
personalfinance,Is there any advantage to consolidation loans for CC debt?,"I tried searching for similar topics on here but couldn't find much.  My situation is that I have about 7-$8K of CC debt from a few years ago.  I'm currently a graduate student and barely able to make minimum payments; budgeting has been stretched fairly far as it is.  However, I will occasionally get offers for consolidation loans and my instinct is to throw these in the trash.

I've been thinking about it and it actually makes sense if I'm understanding it correctly.  Since most of these CC have a 20+% APR on them, if I'm able to get a loan which generates smaller interest that would be the correct move, right?

I have the option of consolidating my loans and applying for public service loan forgiveness, since I'm a teacher.

He has almost $250k in student loans, which we are currently paying about $700/month towards and will soon be paying an additional $300/month towards, as soon as his graduate loans kick in. He will DEFINITELY be consolidating his and is obligated to be a teacher for 10 more years, as we have no other choice. I do not wish to combine our loans, just in case anything were to ever go wrong (I trust him - but you never know!) Our finances are very tight as is (we live and work in a very expensive metro area), but we make it work. We don't really eat out or shop - we're just paying off our upcoming honeymoon and some of the wedding stuff right now and it's a bit draining. I also have a lot of medical expenses. We have a very small savings, but it's definitely there.


I like my job as it stands, but the field of teaching is politically volatile, and I've thought of leaving more than once. Not quite sure what I'd do if I left and don't want to right now, but I'm not quite sure? Also, not sure what happens to this if I were to take childcare leave?

I am debt free, excellent credit - 30 years old, if it matters. Only bills I have are my monthly expenses(relatively low). About to take a 5 month class, where I will not be able to work. The tuition is roughly $11,500.00. This does not include monthly expenses for the 5 months. I have enough in my bank account to pay for school and the 5 months of expenses, but it won't leave more than a month or 2 of monthly expenses in my account.
I should add I probably will have some income coming back in at the end of the 5 months(enough to pay bills).


I was thinking of getting a credit card, something with 0% for 12+ months, and put the tuition cost on the card. This would leave $11.5K in my account - cash in hand. 



Other Details:

I have one other credit card(limit of $8k) but I only use it for emergencies usually. I usually knock it back to 0 if there is more than $1k balance on there. The interest rate is high, I've tried negotiating with them, but I'm really thinking of canceling this card. Credit hit or not.



The questions:


1. Should I do this? Is this a smart move? Should I just pay the cash?

2. Any credit card company suggestions? I'd also like this card to replace my current credit card after the balance is restored(One that I've had since my credit was non-existent)

To my question.  I just recently had an up in income and started aggressively paying off my debt(s).  The only thing I have left now is student loan debt to one company.  It totals about 11K at the moment.  It is actually 4 separate loans totaling different amounts, but because it is paid to one lender, they bundle it all as one monthly payment.  Since it is my last debt I am paying off, I started to look closely at my payment history and interest charged.  

For the past 4 years, I have paid the minimum balance of $177 per month (paid every month and always on time).  The $177 is the single total amount I pay to this lender and that amount is split between 4 different loans. [Here is my last payments on each loan from the end of February.](http://imgur.com/a/z4tbJ)

3 of these loans are Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans with a 6.8% fixed interest rate.  The other is a Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan with a 6.8% fixed interest rate.  I have never missed a payment on any these and to my knowledge (and looking at my account), there is no compounded interest.  When I glance at the math, it looks like around half of what I pay to each loan goes toward interest.  I checked recent payment history (about a year's worth of payments) and they all look the same, some with even more going to interest.

Am I missing something here?  Thanks for your time and expertise.

$41,914.97	3.25%
$43,734.03	2.75%
I then have Department of Education and Federal Loans (not sure what the actual difference is, but they are grouped differently):
Stafford (Dept. of ed)
$4,491.63	6%	 
$1,424.72	6.8%
Stafford (Federal)
$1,493.22	2.33%
$2,833.45	6.8%	
$4,331.90	5.8%


I saw on the wiki that I can target the highest interest loans first. Does the massive difference in principal of my loans change this strategy at all, or should I still focus on making minimum (interest only) payments on the private loans and target the 6.8% loans first?

Also, if I've missed a great post or article on a better plan of attack for paying off this much debt than ""make minimum payments on all loans except the highest interest rate ones"" PLEASE PLEASE let me know (e.g. refinancing, an argument against interest-only payments, etc).

I receive a small stipend from my university, about enough to live off, however from this I owe ~$700 in federal taxes for the 2014 year. My parents both work in finance and they were explaining to me that if I invest $1.1k in a traditional IRA then I won't end up owing any federal taxes. They figured it would be good for me to invest some money in retirement at a young age, and learn a bit about investments. I'm a financially frugal person, and have always wanted to own some stocks, so this is really exciting for me in kind of a nerdy way.

&amp;nbsp;

My dad told me to open a traditional IRA through Vanguard (not a roth IRA). He said I can pick from any infinite number of investments, and that I should do my research and find one I like.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
 
I have three questions:
 
1) Can I open my IRA by investing in an ETF? Based on a little research i did, i like the Vanguard Health Care ETF as a high risk option, and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF as a less risky option. 
2) What are my options for investing only 1.1k. I see a lot of vanguard options require a 3k minimum.
2) Also, what kind of investments would you suggest? I am only investing a small amount, and i'm young, so would it be better to pick a high risk and highly volatile option? Or would a safe option, like an S&amp;P 500 still give me good returns in the future?

**Withdraw Cash Without a Card? There’s an App for That**
*BMO Harris Bank initiative gives new meaning to ‘smartphone withdrawal’ in bid to cut fraud*

By 
RITA TRICHUR
March 15, 2015 6:38 p.m. ET

The latest gambit by banks to reduce card fraud? Get rid of the card.
Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, a unit of Canada’s Bank of Montreal, on Monday will launch the U.S.’s biggest cardless ATM network, allowing customers to withdraw cash by using their smartphones. The bank says the technology will speed up transactions and reduce fraud.
The move will give Bank of Montreal an early lead in one segment of the growing mobile-payments business in the U.S. The Canadian bank’s push comes as lenders seek to cut costs and bolster security as customers increasingly use smartphones to manage their finances. In the U.S., banks face heightened pressures to wring savings by pruning their branch networks while cutting down on card fraud.
BMO Harris Bank says that to access cash without using a debit card, customers can prep a transaction before arriving at an ATM. To do this, they log onto a mobile-banking app on their smartphones, enter the amount to be withdrawn, walk up to an enabled ATM and press the mobile cash button. After the customer holds up the QR code on their smartphone to a reader, the ATM dispenses the requested cash.
The bank says a mobile cash transaction takes 15 seconds, compared with 45 seconds for a debit-card withdrawal, and is safer because the customer doesn’t need to insert his or her card. That eliminates the possibility of “skimming” devices that allow fraudsters to pull information from a card’s magnetic strip in a compromised ATM. Also, no card information is stored on the phone, and the bank can remotely delete the app if a device is lost or stolen.
Information passed between the phone and the ATM is encrypted. Once a withdrawal is complete, the transaction’s metadata vanishes and can’t be reused, the bank says. Customers who also use passwords or biometric fingerprint identification to access their smartphones benefit from an extra layer of security.
BMO is rolling out the service first in the U.S. rather than in its Canadian home market because card security south of the border lags behind that of Canada.
“We know that there have been instances in the past in the financial sector where there has been skimming,” said Connie Stefankiewicz, head of North American Channel Strategy and Solutions at Bank of Montreal. “Cards get lost. Cards get stolen. PINs get skimmed. All of those things are actually mitigated by the use of the smartphone.”
General-purpose debit, prepaid and ATM fraud totaled $1.7 billion in 2012 in the U.S., according to a 2013 Federal Reserve Payments Study. The average fraudulent ATM cash withdrawal was $217.
The so-called mobile cash service initially will be available on 750 ATMs, increasing to 900 ATMs by June, the bank says. BMO Harris Bank, which is ranked No. 2 in both Illinois and Wisconsin by deposit market share—behind J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and U.S. Bank National Association, respectively, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data—has more than 2 million personal and commercial customers, 600 branches and more than 1,300 ATMs.
Payments security has been a growing issue following data breaches at retailers such as Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that fraudsters were putting stolen credit-card data into Apple Inc. iPhones enabled with Apple Pay service.
Although that could make some people leery about using mobile-based cash withdrawals, BMO says the service has added security features because a customer would need the login information for the app in addition to the password or fingerprint data for their own phone.
If a debit card is reported lost or stolen, BMO would deactivate the card.
The app won’t accept stolen-card information. To thwart so-called phishing scams, the bank uses technology that is based on security questions and the “digital fingerprint” of a customer’s smartphone.
In many other countries, including BMO’s home market of Canada, many people do their banking online or via smartphone apps. Checks, and increasingly cash, are falling out of favor with consumers due to the convenience and security of digital payments. The U.S., however, is a bit of an outlier, said Ms. Stefankiewicz.
“There is still quite a high usage of cash in the U.S. relative to Canada,” she said. “In the U.S., people always have cash, I find. It is just a different approach.”
Cash may be king in the U.S., but the growing popularity of app-based payments could eventually pose a competitive threat to BMO’s mobile cash service.
Other U.S. banks are also offering cardless ATMs. Rosemont, Ill.-based Wintrust Financial Corp., which operates in the Chicago area and southern Wisconsin, offers the service on its entire fleet of 195 ATMs. It began rolling out the service last August.
“There’s no way to skim the card,” said Tom Ormseth, head of digital channels for Wintrust. “They don’t just have to do it at the walk-up ATMs, you can also use it at the drive-through.”
Los Angeles-based City National Corp., which is being acquired by Royal Bank of Canada, completed a test of cardless ATMs in July 2014. The company doesn’t have immediate plans to expand the program, said Cary Walker, senior vice president of corporate communications, in an email.
BMO Harris Bank will also open its first “smart branch”—effectively a teller-less location—in Chicago on Monday. The branch will house ATMs that allow customers to communicate with remote tellers via video conference—a move that it says will eventually facilitate round-the-clock branch banking. Another four smart branches are in the works for this year, mostly in the Chicago area.
The model will allow customers to use video tellers to conduct basic transactions, including deposits, withdrawals and bill payments.",cryptocurrency,1426508885

My wife's total student loan debt is $130,566.89 -- her payments are $1,859.74 per month. She is a physician assistant working in pediatrics (she won't be eligible for loan forgiveness).  
Our combined income is about $135,000. We have excellent credit and no other debt other than this student loan debt and our mortgage, which is $1,625 per month for a small townhouse in Northern Virginia (this was about what we were paying in rent for a one-bedroom apartment). We don't have kids but will likely start trying soon.  
We have approximately $12,000 in savings.  
Here is a breakdown on her student loans (the first three are from undergrad). She is just over two years into a 10-year repayment plan.  

 * 1) Federal Unsub Stafford Loan - 6.55% fixed rate (pays $85.40 monthly on $5,553.11 balance)  
 * 2) Federal Unsub Stafford Loan - 6.55% fixed rate (pays $57.43 monthly on $3,754.11 balance)  
 * 3) Federal Unsub Stafford Loan - 2.08% in repayment (whatever the hell that means) (pays $30.29 monthly on $2,296.53 balance)  
 * 4) Direct Loan Unsub - 6.55% fixed rate (pays $210.02 monthly on $15,937.11 balance)  
 * 5) Direct Grad PLUS - 7.65% fixed rate (pays $456.67 monthly on $28,435.88 balance)  
 * 6) Direct Loan Sub - 6.55% fixed rate (pays $97.90 monthly on $7,428.99 balance)  
 * 7) Direct Loan Sub - 6.55% fixed rate (pays $97.90 monthly on $7,428.99 balance) 
 * 8) Direct Loan Unsub - 6.55% fixed rate (pays $163.10 monthly on $12,377.22 balance)  
 * 9) Direct Loan Unsub - 6.55% fixed rate (pays $151.92 monthly on $11,528.83 balance)  
 * 10) Direct Grad PLUS - 7.65% fixed rate (pays $393.76 monthly on $28,473.81 balance)  
 * 11) Direct Loan Unsub - 6.55% fixed rate (pays $106.35 monthly on $7,352.31 balance)  

I have looked into consolidating/refinancing these loans with DRB (they are offering 5% fixed rate but on a minimum 10-year repayment term). Do any banks offer 5-year repayment on lower interest rate (aka pay about same balance as she does now but pay off loans faster with less interest) or can she only extend?

personalfinance,Can someone help me with a more detailed explanation as to why I should not roll my TSP into a new account upon leaving the Fed?,"I understand the TSP is arguably the best retirement account you can get in the US, but all of the advice on here is telling people to keep their money in it and not to move it into an IRA or 401k under pretty much any circumstance.

I'm 22 and have got about 15k saved up in my TSP and will be done with my federal contract at the age of 24 (1.5 years from now, plan to have around 25k at that point) I do not plan to stay in gov't work.

At the age of 24, wouldn't I be doing myself a disservice not to transition that capital into another account to take advantage of the ability to add to the account to allow interest to be gained at a more rapid rate due to a higher account balance through my contributions? I read a financial book and it had a lengthy chapter on the retirement accounts and compounding interest, and to me it seems like even with the fees moving that into an account that I can actually add funds to would do me a service by allowing me to continue to increase my interest gained rather than starting over again from a low balance account resulting in a lower gain over the first 4-5 years of the account's existence. Punching some numbers into a compound interest calculator makes me think that keeping it in the TSP may not actually result in me having more at my point of retirement.

Additionally my own age and balance aside, are there any situations where rolling over the funds would make sense based on the balance and time you will have to let the account grow?

Thanks for all of the help everyone on this sub provides. I'm so fortunate to have found this sub at a young age so I can ensure I'm planning ahead early on to ensure financial comfort for my family early on and later in life.

personalfinance,Trying to get ahead with a bunch of student loans.,"Okay so first off I've got about $106k in student loans, most of it being ""Private"" loans, and about $35k of it being federal loans being serviced through Navient.  

Most of my ""Private Loans"" are close to 7% as they were taken out in 2008-2009 during the economy crash  I was in my junior year and dropping out of college didn't seem like a good idea at the time.

This all said, I've been out of college for about 5 years now and the balances haven't budged an inch, and in addition, killed my credit to what I'd consider to be ""Beyond Repair"" (watched my score go from a 740 to a 502 in just 1 year along with all of my cards being canceled as a result).

My first year out of college, I started repayment... didn't miss any of the payments, things were going well... and then i got laid off without any ""emergency fund"" (as it was 8 months after graduating and I was only making $12.50/hr at the time).

I was unemployed for approx 10 months, I was able to defer my federal loans, but my private loans took a big hit as they just didn't care I had no job.  mind you, the private loans are at roughly 6.8%

I did finally get a job, but at this point, my credit report showed 10 accounts (private loans) all 120+ days delinquent month after month after month for about 6-7 months.  I started to pay a little more than the minimum to the best I could on my new job making $32k/yr at the time.  I did this for 2 years, but could never get caught up... you can see where this is going... ""120 days, 120 days, 120 days, 120 days"" for close to 2 years.

because of the stress I've endured, and harassment from loan collectors etc, my health has been impacted (I suffer from anxiety) and I can't get a full night's sleep, which makes my day-to-day life miserable...  I now get anxious / feel chest pains whenever they call and have had a few full-blown panic attacks where  I feel like i'm going to drop dead from stress.

After much advice from people on /r/sysadmin I left my old job (but not until I had a new one lined up!) and got a new job making $55k/yr + awesome benefits.  I also continue to do side-work and firework shows during the summer, which brings in another 2-3k /yr on top of that.  This has afforded me to slowly bring things back to ""current status"" over the past 2 years.

This month, is the first month in 4 years that everything is under 30 days past-due... I feel proud of what I've done but I realize I have a long way to go.

My credit score at the time of writing this is a 540  I have one medical bill in collections for $300 that I was thinking of just paying off with one of my only two credit cards ($500 and $750 lines of credit... the 2nd one was raised because of good payment history on it's own).  I try to only use up to $400 of the credit just to show that I'm ""using"" credit but I don't impulse buy.. only things like car repairs, or groceries.

I want to get back up to 740 again, I realize it won't be easy... I also want to focus on paying off those loans, but most of them are 10-15 year loans.

I take home about $650/week (I get paid weekly)

My rent (for renting a room in a house) is $980/mo. Utilities Incl.  This is cheaper than a economy apt which around here is anywhere between $1200-1500/mo + Utilities.

My car (which I own, no payments) has issues (who's doesn't!) because of this I try not to live more than 20 minutes from where I work.

I pay $120 to AES, $230 to Chase, $230 to NJ HESAA, $190 to NAVIENT.  This makes my monthly loan payments $770/mo which just covers the minimum for now.

I do contribute $40 pre-tax to my employer's ""Profit-sharing 401k"" which has performed pretty damn well actually the past 2 years.  it only costs me roughly $30 out of my actual paycheck each week, and my employer matches it with $40  (any more wouldn't be matched).  So far I've got about $10k in my 401k in just 1 and a half years.  401k was vested a year ago.  I get ESOP as well (so far it's about 5k) but that won't be fully vested for another 2 1/2 years.  on average ESOP is about 3-4k per year + dividends (which are around 15%)

my car insurance is $75/mo  Pretty good coverage too (300/300k liability and full PIP)  This said, I try to stay out of trouble :P

Now, for the past couple years, every time I get back ""caught up"" I tend to slip back into the negative due to overdrafts.  This is because without a large line of credit, when things like medical bills and/or car repairs pop up, it's the decision of ""Losing my job"" or ""fix the car"".  Usually keeping job and falling behind for a few more months has been the better option.

The problem i'm facing:  Eating cup-o-noodles every day for weeks on end hasn't helped my health any.  nor has the $1 menu at mcdonalds.  I went from weighing 220lbs to almost 290 lbs in about 1 year because of the stress + crappy food + high sodium.  I'm finally back down to 260 but i've got a ways to go.  the gain hurt my knees which cost me $$$ which i'm using my (new) FSA account to pay for rather than my paycheck.

How can I / what should I do to get ahead and STAY ahead for once?  I've thrown together a spreadsheet, called my ""War-sheet"" which is a month-by-month breakdown of all my bills, income, and what is left on a weekly basis.  so far it's helped me to get caught up on everything but I still find myself in tight positions sometimes.  Also, not being able to afford more than a single meal a day / cup-of-noodles in order to avoid having to pay OD fees, is just making my health worse which will just contribute to more $$$ in bills.

how can I break this cycle? how can I get ahead and STAY ahead?  I've already sold most of my belongings that I don't need / use.  I've stopped spending ""on a whim"".  I only carry $600 in CC debt combined, but the $110k in student loans are what are killing me.

EDIT: Thought I should mention... I have no social life (at all) so there is not really much of any money being spent on ""Entertainment""  it's been work, eat, sleep for the past 4 years.  no vacations, no breaks, etc.",finance,1426522214

personalfinance,To buy or not to buy (a home) (CAN),"I have been lurking and reading here a lot and appreciate reading advice from a neutral party. My bank offers advice, but I feel their advice is biased since I am their customer - so I greatly appreciate the advice of those here.

I'm trying to time the purchase of a new home and decide whether to go for it in the short term (next 0-2 years) or keep renting while I take care of other financial priorities.

I am in the GTA of Ontario, Canada in an area that is growing and real estate is increasing in price.  

Financially speaking, I:

- make $70K annually (gross) at a stable job, with steady salary increases yearly. Take home is currently about $3500/month (after taxes, pension, health insurance, life insurance, etc, is deducted).
- I have a solid pension and contribute 11% to it (mandatory)
- I have no car payment
- I have $16K in student debt remaining, with an interest rate of 6% and a monthly payment of $227
- I have $6K in credit card debt (I know!) which is certainly a priority to remedy
- I have approx $25K towards a down payment
- I currently pay $1200/month to rent 

To purchase a condo/townhome that I could see myself staying in for 5+ years, I'm looking at $275-$300K. There are some places available for $200K range, but they are very tiny (1 bedroom or bachelor) and I cannot picture myself staying in them long term - though it would certainly be more financially manageable in the short term. 

I am open to having a roommate to help pay for the mortgage.

I recognize that the credit card debt is a huge priority. I do have a plan to have it on track in short order and then start increasing savings.

I feel like $1200 a month on rent is not the best use of my money and that real estate prices are only increasing the longer I wait. I'm not sure if my impatience to get into the housing market is justified, though, or just setting me up to be house poor.",finance,1426525389

personalfinance,High-interest debt versus Emergency Fund,"After years of getting my head above water, I'm finally at the point of trying to get out of debt.  I know the usual standard is to work on an emergency fund (which I have none currently) before working on paying off debt, but given my particular circumstances I feel this may be different.

I have around $22k in credit card debt, and all at astronomic interest rates--mostly around 27%-29%.  I can contribute around $1k a month (beyond minimums) to pay these down.  I'll also have the occasional influx from an ESPP and yearly bonus, though only partly--a good chunk of those usually takes care of the larger yearly expenses that come up.

The alternative may be to put a portion (say $500) into savings each month and the rest into debt.

I'm not too terribly concerned about an emergency fund, to be honest.  My employer has a well-documented set of minimum severance packages and I have ten years of seniority to factor into that.  They also have a great set of benefits in terms of short and long term disability plus 2x salary life insurance. 

So what is PFs advice?  Thanks


Edit:  Thanks for the responses and advice, everyone.  Talking it out more has made me realize that I really do need to work on the emergency fund with a higher priority than I originally thought.

personalfinance,"This is my financial snapshot. Need help going forward, plus questions of large purchases (car?)","Howdy. This might be a little long but no one taught me this growing up and I'm really tired of bumbling along. 

I'm 20 years old, a sophomore in college and I'll be graduating December 2017. My family has always been poor; my mom used and sucked dry men for their money, and my dad bounced the heck outta that when I was 2. He sent me (my mom) child support of 400 a year since then, but they agreed he'd send that to me once I turned 18 until I graduated college as to help me since he didn't want to cosign any loans unless I went into the military (He doesn't understand how mental illnesses work). Mom is obviously too poor + has horrible credit to cosign, and my family that's still alive either hates that I went to college and didn't get married to a wealthy man, or hates that I went to art school to paint stupid paintings all day (I've tried to explain that I'm majoring in advertising and graphic design with a minor in business and copywriting, graphic design is used everywhere, I'm doing corporate design + web design to work for IT companies in silicone valley, etc) but hey, by default I'm a stupid art kid going to private school. Leaving school and learning a trade is non negotiable so I'm ready to lie in whatever bed I end up with. People have survived worse. 

I'm not really in a position to get a car at this second, but I'm wondering if its something I need to plan to get. Does that make sense? I also am in a position of flux in where my current position is grossly underpaying me (I do literally everything web and print related, but 10.50/hr instead of 16/hr that I was agreed to) and I'm looking at/interviewing at positions between 13-18/hr. 

I currently get only about 100 a week from my current job. I get 60 from my mom a month and 400 from my dad a month. So My total income (not counting freelance stuff, though it averages ~300 a month during the summer months) is 900ish before taxes. 

I go to school full time at 15 hours a week, work 12 hours a week at one job and do odd jobs to give me some cash. My bills are 

* Rent 451.00
* Gas 17.00
* Electricity 57.00
* Spotify 5.00
* Internet 3.50

Total expenses: 533.50

Everything else I just kind of use for food, eating out (can't take lunch with me as I'm mobile for 12 hour days) and whatever supplies I need as a freelance artist that I use as writeoffs when tax season comes about. 

Scholarships, grants, and loans are paying for school and I don't take anything extra for anything other than tuition (~27K/year out of state). I'm looking at ~40K-~55K when I graduate, but less as this august I'm going to start throwing 400.00 to my loans at the school this august totalling about 10K less than what I would graduate with. 

The average for what I'm getting into with entry level is roughly 40-50K starting, but I can hopefully negotiate more as I've been doing corporate design work for a year (currently) and 3 years freelance.. but its at that point numbers I'm not working with.

In order to minimize my expenses I'm moving in with the boyfriend who makes 2000 before taxes. 

When we move in, this is what the budget looks like:

Him

* Rent 685.00 
* His truck payment ~300
* Insurance for him ~30
* Netflix ~ 8

Me

* Utilities 100.00
* Cable + Internet ~70.00 (He is adamant about cable. He grew up middle class so I guess TV is a staple for him, so I haven't won that argument yet. Good internet is non negotiable for me since during the summer months half of my income is just from web work.)
* Spotify 5.00
* Food 150-200 month

My public transportation is free with student id (yass) and I carpool with my bf whenever I need to and fill up gas on weeks he generally takes me 'round a lot as its winter time. I only just recently got to where I am financially, as in the past I've had to live on ~600 a month so my savings is well, nothing. I have no 'assets', and things like ROTH and 401K mystify me. 

So What else should you know? I have a Navy Federal account (dad is military, its checking/savings but I don't use it as there's no branch here other tan to pay with what dad sends me) a chase account (its military so no fees.. ever.) and a paypal debit card so I don't have to wait for money to appear in my account when I get paid via paypal. 

I also had identity theft happen when I was 8. I strongly suspect my mom, but there's no way to tell since she was getting beat so often her memory was off. I was too, so I hardly remember anything that happened between 6-10. Whatever. I turn 18 and I find out my credit score is 318 and I have 3K in debt in credit cards. I couldn't fight it at the time I found out, so here I am two years later (credit score at ~700).

I built credit with a horrible credit card from paypal at 30% since no one let me know how credit cards work and I had no job/was homeless for a month last year. I got approved for a better credit card from chase at 22% interest (its the slate card) and I use that rarely. A recent emergency now has its balance at -140.85 and my paypal card has a balance of -350.58. My mom is giving me 1000 of her tax return in a couple weeks so I'm using that to put both of those balances at 0.00, plus paying a bill I had in collections for 86.57 when I was sick freshman year in 2013 (I was never really in a position to pay it) 

So, thats where I'm at. A possible job that puts me at a two hour bus ride but a 20 minute car ride is my current concern. Is it cheaper to buy a beater and the minimal state insurance or just use uber until I can afford a better car? Uber is ~20 a ride for at that length, so ~40 a day for 2-3 times a week.

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans: fixed or variable?,"Thanks to PF I recently came across SoFi, which I previously did not know existed. I am interested in refinancing both my and my wife's student loans with the goal of reducing interest paid and to make it easier to pay them off sooner. My state's minimum amount to refinance is $25k so I am not able to refinance my loans, but my wife is eligible.  

What is PF's opinion on fixed vs variable loans, especially for refinancing student loans? SoFi has this [relevant link](https://www.sofi.com/blog/how-to-choose-between-variable-and-fixed-rate-student-loans/) but it doesn't really discuss the negatives of a variable rate, aside from the fact that your rate can go up. I don't really understand how loan rates are determined. If I plan on doing a 10 year payment plan, do I run the risk of 2.5% interest loan getting jacked up to 10%+? Is the fixed rate the safe bet?  

To preempt any questions, my wife and I are both working IT professionals. Our fields and income do not qualify us for any kind of federal loan forgiveness, so that doesn't really factor into deciding to refinance or not. Some of our loans are sub 5% but we also have some north of 6% that would make refinancing very beneficial.",finance,1426529718

personalfinance,"Fiancee winds up owing $1,400 after entering 1098-T scholarships. Is this correct?","Hello, thanks for looking. 

My fiancee and I graduated in May of 2014. I got my taxes done on TurboTax without an issue and got my refund. We're working on doing hers now too but there seems to be an issue.

We entered in her 3 W-2s and everything looked good. She earned around $14,000 and paid around $1,100 in federal taxes. At this point TurboTax estimated that she would be getting back ~$800 for her federal refund.

Now we came to the section where we filled out her 1098-T forms for college. Her 2014 1098-T had around ~$17,000 in box 5 (Scholarships or grants) and box 8 was checked to indicate that she was at least a half-time student. Nothing else was checked on the 2014 1098-T.

TurboTax also asked if box 7 was checked on her 2013 1098-T (Checked if the amount in box 1 or 2 includes amounts for an academic period beginning January-March 2014). Because of this TurboTax also asked what her box 2 (amounts billed for qualified tuition expenses) was (approx $40,000) and again what she received in scholarships or grants (approximately $30,000). Again the box 8 was checked to indicate she was at least a full time student. No other box was filled in or checked on the 2013 1098-T.

After entering this information her tax refund went away and was replaced with a ~$1,400 deficit owed. Is this correct and to be expected? 100% of her scholarship income went to tuition and room/board expenses, I'm surprised it's taxable like this.

Should we go see a CPA instead of using TurboTax or just pay the $1,400 because it is correct?",finance,1426530820

personalfinance,Used car shopping has my head spinning. Advice needed!,"My husband and I work together and have for several years. We carpool, so we share the cost of gas &amp; repairs evenly.

We make almost identical salaries. We handle all of our finances separately because we don't own a house yet, and we both do best managing our own money.

We've found a 2011 Prius IV for $15k asking price. It's in excellent shape, only 30k miles, but it has one documented rear accident.

It's far and away the best deal we've found so far based on mileage/features/discount vs buying new, but we're unsure about the decision to buy for several reasons:

1) We currently have two running cars, one we use daily and one we use rarely. They are 15 and 11 years old, so we know that there's not very long before they start to become unreliable. We absolutely need to have at least one reliable car between us. That being said, it's not absolutely urgent that we buy this car.

2) We've never bought a car that's been in a known accident. That's why it's selling for $15k vs more like $20k, but is that enough of a price break to make it worthwhile? We probably wouldn't resell it for at least 7 years, so I'm not very concerned about the resale, but I'd like to know if I'm getting a good deal.

3) We're not sure how to divide the expenses. We've agreed to basically 50/50 on insurance, and of course 50/50 for gas and maintenance too.
The only problem is that we probably won't work together forever. Eventually one or both of us will move on to a new job, but then who owns the car? Should whoever owns it pay more than half the car payment? Who is then tasked with buying another car, which we'll inevitably need by then?

4) We would be paying a $4k down payment, so financing roughly $11k. The dealer won't give us an interest rate by phone, so we have to travel two hours just to find out. We're thinking that anything under 3% would be okay. Any insights as to whether or not 3% is too high/low? Should we seek financing elsewhere? I have very good credit and my husband has excellent credit.

Any insight into any of these issues (or others I don't know about) would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",finance,1426542285

We have been working with his most recent employer to sort out 401k and life insurance situations, and they have been most accommodating. 

One of the issues we are trying to work through is tracking down unknown accounts. For example we know he had an additional life insurance policy, but we haven't a clue what company it is through.  Is there a national database we can ping to get some of this information?

Similarly, we don't know if he had 401ks floating around from past employers. His had been at his last employer for the past 5yrs or so, but went through a few year period prior of having many short stays at different companies. 

My father was an accountant, and kept everything pretty well under wraps and out of the minds of the rest of the family. We are digging through his archives and discovering things we hadn't a clue about. So we are looking for a few nudges in the right direction in regards to consolidating any unknown accounts.


Side question that is related to the situation: My parents had borrowed $10k from his most recent 401k to pay off some debt, and have $5k to partially pay that back. It was on their list to take care of this spring, but those funds haven't been put back into the account to pay back the loan. My mother doesn't know the details on this loan against the 401k, and we are unsure how the death affects this money owed back.

We are also unsure how the 401k will be dispersed as a result of his death. We assume it will be taxed income if paid out to our mother. Is there options to roll over into an IRA or similar type account for her sake, without taking tax hit just yet? She does not work (not to say raising seven kids it's work), and has very little income (&lt;$5k a year) with one minor dependent living at home (he's 15).

So I spoke to Fidelity and they enlightened me that I could ""borrow"" from my 401k and pay myself back at an interest rate of 4.2%. Is this a wise move so I can put a larger chunk down on the home?

Back story- Found a home we loved for 140k, with closing cost and money down I'd need about $12,500. I thought I could borrow most of that 12,500,  if not all from 401k and pay myself back in interest, there for, making more money in my 401. Good idea, or bad?

2nd thought- If I'm paying myself back, why not borrow 45k and drop that on the home as a down payment, and pay 45k back to myself in interest at 4.2% rather than paying the bank that 4.0% rate (there for losing 4.0% to the bank over the life of the mortgage)? Wise move or not? I know there's no tax or penalties, and I could pay it back in 5 years at $106 per pay ($212 a month over 5 yrs to pay it back).

I am hearing that it is double taxed when I cash out at retirement age. Also hearing, if laid off/cut from the job, you'd have to pay that back within 90 days, that's rough if that's true... What to do PF, what to do?

personalfinance,I owe slightly more on my car than it's worth. Should I focus on getting ahead?,"I'm not sure how to calculate the value of my car, but based on KBB  I'm about $1,000 behind dealer trade in value (I'm ~$500 ahead of private party rate). However, part of the reason for this is that I have a warranty on it for 3.5 years (5 at the start) or 100,000 miles (at 42k). This is transferrable (and already saved me $1,500 on engine work). Should this factor into my cars current value?

My question is this: Should I take the extra I'm putting towards my student loans ($220 a month) towards my car to get ahead of the trade in value? Interest rates are 5.1% (car) vs (avg) 4.8% (but the $220 extra per month goes towards my 5.5% loans).",finance,1426551548

financialindependence,Just starting the long FI road. 31 making roughly 90k/year.,"Hi guys!

I'm trying to get on track with FI and have taken some steps I have found through /r/PersonalFinance and reading MMM.  So far I have paid all debt and am currently debt free (minus a car payment).  I'd really love to be FI by the age of 50 but earlier if possible.  I have some questions for you guys and I hope you can answer them.

1. What's your stance on insurance while FI? Due to some health conditions in my family we would need health coverage that includes cardiac followups annually.  How do you budget for this while being FI?  While on the topic of insurance do you guys carry Life Insurance or Disability insurance?  I currently have Life/Dental/and Health thru my employer but that will end when I am able to live FI.

2. I'd like to save for my kids (3 of em) college fund and am currently saving $1000 a month for them.  Is a 529 the best place to put this money?  I haven't opened one of those and am just using a savings account for now.  What's the preferred method to do this?

3. I've seen [this](https://i.imgur.com/fb7Dtmh.png) image posted in /r/PersonalFinance.  Is this sound advice that I should follow?  I am currently saving for retirement thru my TSP and do not have any other retirement accounts setup.  Should I have opened a IRA and saved there instead before I continue with my TSP?

4. I know I've posted and asked this before but I want to double check on my TSP allocations since I'm here.  New deposits are allocated as follows.  G fund 50%, F fund 0%, C fund 23%, S fund 13%, I fund 12%.  There were some decimals so that may not add up to 100 but thats the gist of it.

5. I have extremely little experience with stocks and have no idea how bonds work so I am very apprehensive of them.  Are they recommended or should I stick with the TSP and possibly IRA for now?

Financial Details:

* Salary:  ~$90,000.00/year

* Military Disability: ~$9,600.00/year (Still waiting on my rating but told to expect at least that)

Debt:

* Car Loan: $18,000.00 @ 2.75% (Just bought the car in December)

Savings:

* Emergency Fund: $10,000.00 (Plan to save a total of $18,000.00)

* Savings for Car/Home maintenance: $2,000.00

* TSP: $11,503.56 @ 15% Roth (Just started my Civilian job in September - didn't save much in my Uniformed Services TSP unfortunately)

I look forward to all your replies!

personalfinance,"25 yr Male, 51k salary, 61,000 student + auto loan. how do I get started?","Hello reddit, I figured now would be a good time to join the community as I am attempting to get serious about my finances and build for my future. Ive already found great advice on here but I figured id give it a try. My situation is not the greatest, but I don't believe its the worst.

To start, I'm a 25 yr recently single male that makes 51k salary. I have a 23k auto loan that I purchased last year when I started my job. My car at the time was an absolute junker and I wanted instant gratification for starting my career by buying a new(ish) car. I bought a 2011 Camaro, which I love, which after fees and such came up to be 21k. My credit was low at the time , mid 500, so I was set up through a loan through a shady broker.  My auto loan was financed for 72 months at 19.45% interest.  Then I was not (and can argue that I still am not completely) financially savy. Ive never had a credit card and assumed 19% interest wasn't as bad as it really is. I currently pay about $560 a month towards this loan. Essentially after reading subreddits here I found out I was upside down on this loan the day I drove off the lot. I believe its currently worth around $15k which is 6k less than what I owe on it.

I also have about 46k in federal student loans which im currently paying $326 a month.

I live in a semi-expensive area and currently have high expense I intend to reduce when I can exit my lease. I currently pay $1030 in rent, $204 in car insurance, along with another $375 for furniture that I bought ""90 days "" same as cash where things came up and I decided to just pay it out during the duration of the tenure. (Also dumb I know). I currently have options to contribute to 401k etc but ive been quite bad with finances lately that I rarely have extra money saved and have not started any of these. I also have about 3k in collections from old medical bills etc.

I know I haven't made the best of decisions but I honesty believe that im ready to start striving to improve my financial situation.

My first goal is to attempt to refinance my auto loan. Ive tried this a couple of times, first 6 months into it, and again yesterday as im awaiting a response from it. Ive recently learned its hard to refinance an upside down loan however. I may be stuck with the 19% interest, which sucks because I paid over $3000 in interest alone last year. 

Whether I can refinance the loan or not, my plan is to create a set budget where I delegate money to the requirements, and then dump everything else I have into my auto loan. I will have to be disciplined to not eat out and stick to my budget at all times, but I hope this will make a difference in my finances and I can work to start pushing down my debt. Im thinking my car will be mostly paid off in 4 years, where I can then spend all of the money going towards my auto payment to my student loans. My issue is that, considering I develop the discipline to stick to this, I wont be able to reasonably start saving any money until im close to 30. Is this a good plan, or should I take a different approach? 


*edit - Yes I know my finance suck. that's why im here today to start working on them. Several people have suggested I sell my car. Any suggestions on how to do that since I owe more than the car is worth, and Its unlikely I will be able to get a loan for the difference? 

Also, I made a mistake with the initial loan amount. The initial loan amount was 22.6 k. After I paid about $4400 into it, the current balance is 21k. That's how I came up with the $3000 interest statement. Also, for those wondering why/how I thought it was a good idea, I didn't necessarily. I grew up in poverty struggled extensively through college, finally got a decent (imo) job and thought that allowed me to purchase a better car. I don't think anyone is saying the price is much for the car, the interest it what was ridiculous. anyway thanks for all the advice hopefully I can get some more and develop a concrete plan on improving.


*edit. got denied on the auto refinance since i was upside down. to be expected. I dont think i would be able to sell the car right now due to the difference in value of being upside down.  I currently use mint, ill look into the other app suggested and get started saving and paying down. ive found that i have room to save $100 a month and have about $140 left over that i can add on too the highest interest items. in a couple of months i should be able to knock off atleast $260 per month in spending bringing me up to $400 extra i can put toward the car. in august ill look to move to cheaper place hopefully around 600 a month if i cant find a roomate and that should push me to around $800 a month extra i can put toward loans. ill just basically throw all of my money at it for a while but pying $1300 a month should help to reduce the principal to something reasonable.  after a few months i will return and ask for advice again.

thanks everyone for contributing yeah i fucked up but im serious about trying to reverse this so well see how it goes. one thing i know is that its going to suck..

Im basically allowing myself $120 a month in misc money until i get this fixed. that includes eating out entertainment etc... so my life will likely not be great for a while but im confident by refocusing my priorities i can start to recover from this mountain of debt.

i feel like this is the best plans with the hand i dealt myself. any last input?",finance,1426556869
personalfinance,Advice for a student with a decent amount of credit card debt ($5500)?,"Hey /r/personalfinance,

I've read some really inspirational stories on here, and I've come looking for advice with my own situation.

A little background - I'm a full time student, 21 years old, studying in the sciences. I'm almost finished my first B.Sc (biology major) and am currently in the applicant pool for my second degree (bachelor of health sciences). I work 25-30 hours a week, but had a really awful summer (summer 2014) where I struggled to make ends meet. Because of this summer, I have $5500 in credit card debt that I'm struggling to pay down. I haven't used these cards since basically maxing them out by the end of September. Part of this is also due to having my laptop stolen and having to unexpectedly purchase a new one. Both the cards have a 19.99% interest rate.

I currently make ~$900 a month, have rent that's $500/mo (utilities included), I spend ~150/mo on groceries (I'm a small, single girl - I really don't eat much and do it on a budget), and the rest goes towards debt repayment. Every time I make a payment, it seems like interest brings it back up to near its limit (I have ~$30 available on each card right now).

Now, I have 2800 in credit debt. 4000 limit

Right now, I am broke until the 8th of april. Like completely. The 8th I should get at least 2.5 or 3, but next paycheck I should get 2 or 3 grand more. living expenses around 1.5k. 

So, I have no real insentive to pay this off, because I believe there is nothing the bank can do to me, but I would like to pay it off in case I come back to the states and planning to move to Hong Kong soon where visa is accepted.

Now, I talked with BOA. They said I have three options : apply for an new interest rate which will take 45 days, credit transfer, or some name I forget. 

1. option: I'm doing but I can't let this money keep beginning compounded at 33 percent or it will become a monster.

2. Credit transfer( I think) The lady at Bank of America totally confused me how this work. So I use all of my remaining credit 1200 usd to transfer into my bank account( she told me this. money will have no interest.) so then I would use that credit to immediately pay off the credit with interest. 

How much would I owe them ? 

She told me, I would owe them. 1600 credit with interest and 1200 with no interest. 

but I did not take it. beause I think I would owe them. 2400 with no interest. and 1600 with with 33 percent interest. 

3. Then I would transfer 1200 to a credit card have currently here that interest is added like two days after my day check and pay it off immediately when I got my paycheck. Thus I would have no balance on that card and would only have to pay 1200.

thus would leave me with she said 1200 with no interest for a year. I think It would leave me 2400 with no interest for a year in my Boa credit card account

plus 400 with a rather high interest rate but managable because it is only 400. 

now, can you explain if she was right or wrong? What is this credit transfer thing and how does it work? 

And how would you go about paying it off? 

bc I may not if I cannot lower this interest rate on this credit, It is ridiculously high I think. I literally have nothing in america in my name and the country I currently live in VISA has like no standing.

My statement comes out on the 20th, and my due date is the 17th. So if I have roughly 200 on the card right now, I should wait until after the 20th to pay it, right? The charges show up, but I just want to be sure that they are not due until the following month. I'm very new to credit, and I am purposefully using the card as a tool for things I had to buy anyways. I have also been told that 10% of my limit is the magic number to have on my statement. Am I doing this right? Any advice would be greatly appreciated",finance,1426594965

personalfinance,Graduate student in the sciences (making stipend) with student loans: stash money in savings account or invest?,"Hello r/personalfinance, looking for some advice. I'm a 25 year old graduate student in the sciences with a lot of student loan debt (~60k). I am married and my wife and I have combined income of ~$65k and live in a moderately expensive city. My wife also has student loan debt, but significantly less and her interest rates are very low (2ish%). My loans are deferred because I am in graduate school full time. I can pay off accrued interest but if I try to pay off the capital the loans must come out of deferment and I will need to make at least the minimum payment every month (I probably would not be able to do this on our current income). We have an adequate emergency fund and we have no other debts. Once I finish graduate school I will likely be making 105k-130k starting salary. My question is about what I should do with the money that I am able to save now. Should I begin investing the money that we save in, for instance, a Roth IRA or should I simply stash this money in our savings account (1% interest) and then throw it all at the student loans once I graduate? It seems like most people suggest saving for retirement as early as possible, but paying off debts generally takes precedent over retirement savings. However, it just feels like a waste to have a chunk of money that just sits in a savings account rather than growing through investments. It is also my assumption that I will be able to pay off my loans in a reasonable time frame when making &gt;100k. This is kind of an odd situation, or at least doesn’t fall under the standard “I have X amount of debt, how should I deal with it?” scenario. Does anyone have experience with a similar situation or have any advice for how I should handle this?

I have been a lurker for quite a while and read many articles learning as I go. During the last year I have learned quite a bit, as I was trying to adjust to a salary increase of 1000+ income a month. (Not that this number doesn't include the mileage I am paid and can only partially account for overtime which some months adds another 500-1k)

**My goal is to not only build my credit score faster, but to wisely invest/payoff instead of letting cash sit in a savings account. This may mean I should be paying more of my current loans down, but that is why i come here to ask.**

My current leaning is to stick every dime extra in savings, but I can't imagine this being the wisest situation. 

**Breakdown : Credit Score - 631 Transunion, 624 Equifax.**
Outstanding item - GE Money Bank $522 Current Balance opened 6 years ago. Do I benefit most from paying this off? Waiting for it to drop off my credit? On equifax it shows the status of Collection/Charge-Off.

I had a secured credit card with Wells Fargo opened April 2014 that I have missed no payments on and Wells Fargo automatically upgraded my card to a 600$ Limit in Feb 2015.

**I have a Student Loan with the following numbers.**
1. Stafford 2 unsubsidized with 6.55% (totals of 1,653. total of 3,642.54) 
2. Stafford 1 subsidized with 6.55% (total of 347.04)

Yearly interest is around      $142.

**1500$ line of credit** that has 541 of it utilized (paid a large medical bill before it hit credit) which gets paid every month

 
**My monthly bills are currently only 600$, but expect that to jump to 1100 in July of 2015. I receive approximately 1400 every two weeks after taxes from Wages and make approximately 350 a month from expenses after paying for Gas and putting aside money for maintenance.

personalfinance,Transfer student about to pay $18K/year tuition | Am I overpaying?,"As of right now I am a 4.0 community college student about to graduate in May with my AA. My current student loan debt is the federal max for two years at $7,500 (all paid for through these loans besides two summer courses last year). 

My question for you is regarding the transfer process. I've spent my entire time while at community college doing a ton of research on possible schools to transfer to, and I've had extensive communications with many of these schools (admissions directors at private universities are amazing by the way). After a year of dreaming about moving away to Chicago to pursue my BA, I settled on staying put in my hometown to attend a fairly prestigious private school. 

The school offered me $15,500 in scholarships as a transfer student, the absolute maximum they offer. So, before financial aid (I've yet to find out my award, and they do have school grants available), I'm looking at a price tag of just over $18K/year in tuition. I would be living at home for free with food and gas paid for by my parent. 

Am I wrong in still feeling like I'm way overpaying though? The degree this school offers is extremely unique, as it sets students up for working in the government or to pursue law school with a leg-up on the competition. (I understand law school gets a lot of well-deserved heat on Reddit.) My goal is to someday work on education reform at a state or national level, and I have the backing (letter of recommendation when/if I decide to apply to law school, etc.) from a former Chief Justice of the state Supreme Court. But there really isn't a lot of solid info for me on the job market in terms of earning potential. 

State universities have also offered me modest scholarships between $1,500-$3,000/year, but adding up all of the costs of living on campus basically evens out to what I'd be paying while going to the more prestigious school and living at home. Plus these other schools don't necessarily offer majors relevant to what I'm passionate about. (All schools in my state have articulation agreements stating that they *must* accept all credits from my community college-- as long as I graduate with an Associate's degree; so there's no worry there with losing out on credits between the schools.) 


Have any of you been through this transfer process? Do you have tips on overcoming tuition anxiety? I'm also wondering if it's worth sinking a couple hundred bucks a month into my debt while still in school with a part-time job. It would also be helpful in getting some realistic tips on how to handle debt right out of school, including savings plans and any sort of debt-free programs. I had this exorbitant hope of graduating with no more than $30K of student loan debt, but that doesn't seem doable anymore (looking more realistically at $43-$44K).

personalfinance,"Federal loans in default, attending professional school in the fall. How does this impact my scholarships and aid?","I attempted to post this in /r/studentloans but couldn't get past the spam filter. Regarding the following: I recognize I am an idiot, but I appreciate any advice you are able to give.

I graduated from college in 2013 with ~27k in debt. There's a long story behind this, but I'm going to fast-forward to last May, when I finally placed all of the account information/logins/addresses/phone numbers/e-mails, etc., on my student loans in my own name. They had been completely neglected prior to May. I took over payments and have been consistent since.

Turns out I missed my federal loans in all this. I do recall calling my undergrad about all my loans (it was listed as a step on a checklist), but I don't remember what they said other than ""your tuition is paid in full, and call Sallie Mae."" I have two Perkins loans, one for $1,500, one for $2,000. They have been in default since November, but probably because I move so often and because the addresses and phone numbers listed on my loans prior to May were expired, I never heard a peep about it. I honestly had no idea they existed. 

I'm going to professional school in the fall and have been receiving scholarship and financial aid responses lately. I've recently had two schools e-mail me to alert me to the fact that I had federal loans in default (which was news to me). They said I'm ineligible for federal aid and that I'm unlikely to be able to get private aid with a federal default on my credit history.

The loans themselves are not a huge problem. I make decent money and have limited expenses. I am easily able to afford my private loan payment and the rehab on my federal loans, no matter how exorbitant the monthly payment: they're so darn small, I'd almost rather pay them off outright, if that would solve anything (which it won't).

I called my servicer and initiated rehab yesterday, but nine months puts me at November before my loan recovers and I'm eligible again. School starts in August. 

Questions:

1.) **Should I rehabilitate my loan or consolidate it?** Consolidation gets it out of default but leaves the default on my credit, I know; whereas rehabilitation gets it off my credit. The problem is the time difference: rehabilitation takes nine months (putting me at November, after school starts), whereas consolidating only requires three months (so in time for school). I'm having problems finding out whether consolidation will actually make me eligible for federal loans again or not, though.

2.) **Will this actually make it impossible/incredibly difficult for me to get private funding?** I'm counting on attending with a sizeable scholarship, but I'll still need loans. (An aside regarding whether I'm even going to *get* federal aid: maybe, but probably not. For the schools who require NeedAccess (showing what your parents make), almost definitely not; for the ones that only require a FAFSA, maybe, but I doubt it. Plus, some of these schools say that merit scholarships make you ineligible for federal aid. So it's not the actual *need* for the federal aid that's driving me; just the consequences on other borrowing.)

3.) **Will I be retroactively eligible for federal aid once my rehab is complete in November?** If I find a way to swing the first semester, once my rehab is complete in November, will I be able to apply the aid to that semester at that point? If not, I *will* be ""back on track,"" so to speak, the next semester, right? Basically-- **this is only a problem til November, right? Then it is off my credit and borrowing should be an option again?**

personalfinance,Fine-tuning my long-term plan,"To keep things simple I'm going to list assets and debt:

Assets:

1. $100,000 (and change), to be invested in a Vanguard account over the next 40 years (functionally my retirement account) with a slowly decreasing risk profile. This is a piece of inheritance that I don't technically have access to until 2018, but my FA/Lawyer and I thought it would be good to invest it in the mean time and agreed that supplementing my retirement in a way that I can keep relatively liquid in the event that I want to use it for other things down the road (grad school tuition), as there are no penalties for taking cash out of this.

2. A few thousand dollars in old persian rugs I intend to sell. This is a very conservative estimate. They are large and nice rugs and I've got a half dozen of them.

Debts:

1. ~$30k for my student loan at a pretty low rate, I intend to keep the payments on the low end until 2018 and then weigh pulling money out of my Vanguard account to cover that against leaving it in to grow.

2. $9k in credit card debt (I know, I know), that I will be paying down after I sell the rugs. Whatever is left I'll cover out of a small bit of inheritance I have access to at the moment.

3. A strange bit of money owed directly to my university because they screwed up my financial aid. They don't care how fast I pay it down as long as I make monthly payments and there's no interest. Something like $4k.

4. My late father's monthly contribution towards the parent loan under my mother's name. About $240 a month but I believe it increases. I think it continues for another 10 or 15 years. I'd like to see about splitting this and getting the interest rate lowered, or just splitting it and paying my half down as fast as possible because the interest rate is a bit higher.

I have no 401k employer contribution that I am aware of (will look into this but it looks like they don't have one) and have a pretty healthy retirement thing going, so I feel like my situation is a bit different.

Income-wise I'm a recent college grad and will be teaching English in Asia for the next year making ~30k.

My idea is to pay down the CC debt because that was a huge fuckup, then get the parent loan split somehow and aggressively pay that off, then pay off that odd bit of direct university debt (I guess you could call it a bill of sorts), then pay off my regular uni loan.

Questions:

1. How's my plan?

2. Should I do a Roth IRA in addition to what seems like a pretty strong retirement account? Keep in mind I'm paying down a fair bit of debt without much income.

3. Should I start a 401k or wait until I have a job that matches my contributions? (401k may or may not be part of my Vanguard account, I really don't know yet).

personalfinance,How do I know if I have no Minnesota income tax liability/ if I can claim exempt from withholding?,"Hi, I'm in another tax pickle because my knowledge is quite minimal, so I would love any help you can give me with your knowledge on this so I can learn more and get this done right!!!

So I make ""royalties"" income from mining from Minnesota lands, it's not a lot, it's between 200$ and 300$ every quarter/4 months. And I do not live in Minnesota,  I live in another state.

I have a W4 form I'm supposed to send back if I want to fill it out.

I can fill out either section 1, or section 2.

Section 1 is if I claim fewer Minnesota allowances than federal, or if I want more withheld --I don't know how many federal allowances I have claimed on W4. So I don't know what to do with this section.

However, I talked to the accountant from the company that I receive the payments from, and she was somewhat helpful but didn't answer all my questions. She said that I most likely only need to fill out Section 2, which is exemption from Minnesota withholding, and that (because I have jobs which make me not exempt from federal withholding) I probably should check the box that says:

""Even though I did not claim exempt from federal withholding, I claim exempt from Minnesota withholding because I had no Minnesota income tax liability last year, I received a refund of all Minnesota income tax withheld, AND I expect to have no Minnesota income tax liability this year.""

The question is, I have no idea if I can claim no Minnesota income tax liability, or if I am exempt from it.

I looked on the back of the form, and it says for Section 2 that I can claim exemption if I meet one of the following requirements it lists, and the only one that might apply to me (the others are too specific to apply to me) says this:

""You meet the federal requirements; you claim exempt from federal withholding on Form W-4 and you also want to claim exempt from Minnesota withholding; you had no Minnesota income tax liability in the prior year; you received a full refund of Minnesota tax withheld; and you expect to have no Minnesota income tax liability for the current year.""  

I don't know if I meet the federal requirements (as opposed to Minnesota?).

I tried looking these up but I can't figure it out, and it's definitely not very clear unless I'm totally missing something.

All I know is -- it's between 200 and 300$ every 4 months, so it's about 1000$ total for the year, and I don't live there, and it's the only income I receive from that state.

If I am exempt from the withholding from Minnesota, does that mean when I do my taxes by April 15, that I will get back anything they withheld from this last year? And they won't withhold any more? So I won't be liable for those taxes?

I guess that's why this form is important, because it might mean I get more money back now, and in the future?

Sorry if I am misunderstanding something but this is what I know to the best of my ability and would LOVE any help I can get here.

What are my options to pay the taxes as i literally have no money left. Also have to pay for mortgage and the wifes pregnancy expenses. Any help is appreciated. Thanks reddit!",finance,1426610884

personalfinance,"After a rough couple of years with Payday loan debts, overdrafts and credit cards, I am nearly there! (UK)","I've seen a lot of guys on here sharing their success stories so i thought i would too.
It all started when i left university and started an apprenticeship nearly 4 years ago. I left uni £1000 overdrawn to a job that started on 15k/year. It was low and i moved away from home but was lucky enough to have parents that would help me out with rent and what not. Anyway, i met a girl who was working at the same place, on the same wage but lived with her parents. This is where things went seriously downhill for me. She was controlling and demanding and i ended up paying for things and doing things that i really could not afford. I ignored my overdraft with my old bank and started with a new one (i cannot stress this enough, **NEVER** do this!!!) That problem took a back seat until last august, and i forgot all about it. 

Anyway, i was dating this girl and we were going away on trips, eating out... pretty much anything that would take my mind off what an awful person she really was! I was pretty depressed at the time, so in my spare time took up substance abuse, which also doesn't come cheap!

So how did i pay for all this i hear you ask?? With several Payday loan companies willing to lend money to low-lifes like me, complete with ridiculous interest rates (e.g. wonga.com at 1,509% APR), i started using them. I would get the loan of say £200, then pay it back the next month, with an additional £100. Obviously this snowballed so i started using different companies to pay off each one and so forth. I don't know what i was thinking, well i wasn't thinking at all. This went on for a long time until i racked up a £3,000 debt, including 800 on a credit card i had applied for. Enough was enough!

My money worries and drug problems really got to me, and my emotionally abusive girlfriend tipped me over the edge. I snapped! She was the first to go, i couldn't sort myself out with someone so unsupportive in my life. I saw a counsellor for a while but found that now the girlfriend was gone, my substance abuse problem pretty much kicked itself! Finally, i contacted my Brother and told him everything! He's 3 years older than me and has always been the sensible one of the family. I thought this news would get to him, shock him and make him angry. But he knew what was going on. Hell, he asked me if anything was up on several occasions, so i should've known of his suspicions. 

Anyway, here comes the great news! His friend who studies finance told me that these payday loan companies have no real authority! They can't send bailiffs round, or repossess anything from you as long as you keep in contact with them and sort an arrangement to pay. This can be as little or as much as you can afford. 
So i set this up nearly 2 years ago, and things just got better, up until my old bank contacted me wondering why i wasn't paying them back. They then cancelled my overdraft and contacted me via a money recovery service. I was panicking but this all turned out to be fine. By this time i had cleared my payday loan debts, my wage had gone up and was now at £24k/year, so i arranged to pay them £100 back each month. This isn't fully paid off yet, but i only have 2 months left! I also just sold my car and have paid off my credit card, so come May i will be 100% debt free!

So the main reason i am writing this is to let anyone know that any debt, big or small, can be sorted! You just have to face up to it and realise that the help is out there to assist you in clearing it. And i also want to warn people of the **dangers of payday loans!!** I look at my Equifax page today and see a remaining debt of £200 and my score up to 470, rather than the £3000 and sub-100 score i had 2 years ago! My new, amazing and supportive girlfriend of the last year and a half is moving in with me in July, i will be debt free and finally have someone to half the bills with. Things are getting better and i can't help but smile!

19,758.27 @ 6.8%

4506.55 @ 4.5%

12,938.36 @ 3.86%

9058.49 @ 3.4%


These loans are all lumped into one total of 46,358.39 at Great Lakes Borrowing, and I currently pay 330.64/month on them.


In addition, I have a cosigned loan with my mother through Navient for 3520.83 @ 9.25% (YOUCH! Would not have taken this loan out if I had know better back then).


Lastly, my mother has taken 2 parent plus loans out for me totalling 24,560.37 @ 7.9% interest (Also ouch), that she expects me to repay, which I'm okay with.

So my total comes out to $74439.59.



I really want to get rid of that cosigned loan because it is so small and such a high interest rate, I think the minimum payment is around $70, and almost half of it is going to interest.



I will be renegotiating my salary in 2 months, and will be asking for a significant raise. I started as an intern at my company and have been there for a year and a half. Was started off about 10k lower than my ask because I was in a panic to secure income as my preferred job offer fell through.

Currently I am just making minimum payments on everything, which totals up to almost 600/month. I'd like to be smart about paying these off, and I'm just not sure how best to go about it.

personalfinance,What are my options for getting rid of PMI insurance?,"I purchased a home in 2012 with an FHA loan and refinanced in 2013 with an FHA loan at 3.5%. Refinanced loan currently has a balance of about $197,000. The house appraised for $225,000 in 2012 but I have since completed substantial renovations that I believe has given me at least 20% equity in the home (I plan to confirm with an appraisal in the near future).

If I do in fact have 20% equity, what are my options to remove PMI insurance from my premium at this point, which is $200 a month? Can I do it with my current lender without loosing my current interest rate? Or would I have to refinance, and if so, would it make sense to do so if I loose the 3.5% rate?",finance,1426617765
personalfinance,Am I mathing this right? Calculating the best scenario for buying and renovating a house.,"Currently looking to buy our first home. Location and safety are #1 to me, and more and more it's looking like that in order to get a house we can afford in the area we want, we'll have to buy a fixer upper and renovate. 

Ultimately, we only plan to live in this home for 10 years. Thus, the lower our mortgage balance can be at the 10 year mark, the better shape we'll be in to buy our second home. 

Researching, I'm seeing three major options: 1. 203k loan   2. Fannie Mae Homestyle Loan and 3. my state's reno loan, which is an additional loan (separate from your mortgage) instead of all-one loan like the first two options. The state loan is 10 years instead of 30 years and has a higher interest rate: 8% (as opposed to roughly 4% for a 203k or homestyle loan). 

Some rough numbers: We'd probably purchase a home for around $250,000 and put in $35,000 of work. We have $20,000 to put down (and an additional $15,000 saved for closing costs). 

For options 1 and 2, the mortgage and reno costs would be combined into one mortgage, $265,000 borrowed at 4% over 30 years.

For option 3, the mortgage and reno loan are separate. The mortgage would be $230,000 borrowed at 4% over 30 years. The reno loan would be $35,000 borrowed at 8% over 10 years. 

After running calculations for each scenario, I was surprised to see that even though the interest rate is double, the state additional loan (option 3) seems to be the best way to go, financially. At the end of ten years, we'll have paid off the renovation loan AND owe significantly less on our mortgage than if we go with option 1 or 2, in which the cost of the renovations might also be borrowed at 4%, but it's spread out over 30 years. 

Did I do this right? Am I missing any caveats here, or am I on the right track in thinking that the state loan is the best bet because, even though it's a higher interest rate, the 10 year term makes this scenario favorable?",finance,1426618159
personalfinance,Should I pay for an appraisal to remove PMI?,"I just contributed enough to get my LTV to 80%.  I called my lender, they said I will need to pay for an appraisal to remove PMI.

I'm paying about $76 for PMI each month and my interest rate is 3.25%.


Does it make more sense to:

- Pay an additional $4600 principal to remove PMI now (I have the funds)

- Pay $360 for an appraisal and remove PMI now

- Leave it alone, and just make regular payments, and in about a year I can remove PMI when my LTV drops to 78%",finance,1426618608

personalfinance,"Paying off some debts, but I'm not sure what should be paid off and what can just wait until later.","Hi all, 

Forewarning – this will be long as I like to write a lot…  My husband and I decided that to minimize some of our monthly payments, we were going to sell some of our stocks. Not all of them, but enough that we now have $8300 to move around (with about $2500 left in the account, mostly in Apple and S&amp;P stock). Part of that is set to go towards paying off our car – it only has $1850 left on it, and that will free up $200 a month to put somewhere else. That will leave us with about $6400 that I had thought about throwing into our credit card debt, but now I’m unsure if we should use all of it for that, or allocate some of it elsewhere. Currently, our credit cards looks like this (and there are a lot): 

Card 1: Balance of $1164, APR 27.29% - minimum payment $39 (paying $50)
Card 2: Balance of $1820, APR 18.99% - minimum payment $51 (paying $60)
Card 3: Balance of $1774, APR 16.99% - minimum payment $51 (paying $60)
Card 4: Balance of $1841, APR 16.99% - minimum payment $45 (paying $50)
Card 5: Balance of $694, APR 16.99% - minimum payment $22 (paying $30)
Card 6: Balance of $451, APR 22.90% - minimum payment $25 (paying $30)
Card 7: Balance of $333, APR 15.24% - minimum payment $25 (paying $30)
Card 8: Balance of $237, APR 22.90% - minimum payment $25 (paying $50)

So yeah… there’s that. That’s $8340 on its own, and I knew we weren’t going to pay them all down/off (and I didn’t want to empty the stocks completely as our Apple stock has been a great gain for us). There are three more cards but they are at a $0 balance. The balances have been on there for so long, and we haven’t used them in about a year now - they are out of sight, out of mind. We both use our debit cards for everything, and don’t carry them with us, so I know we won’t be in the “Ooooh money to spend now!!”. There is always the option of putting them in a safe deposit box at our credit union – the smallest box is a $35 annual fee so nothing ridiculous, but that’s just an option. But anyways, I’m starting to ramble…

I know someone will ask, so I’ll just list it now - our other debts/monthly payments breakdown like this: 

Car - $206
Car &amp; Renters Insurance - $130 
All those CC’s - $360
Phones - $160 
Comcast TV (local channels only)/Internet/Netflix - $78
Gym - $37 
My student loans – Private Loans are at a set fee of $153 ($23,600 left). My Federal Loans ($13,330 left) right now are $99, but we just filed our taxes and it looks like I can get them down to $50 a month based on last years income (I was unemployed for half the year)
His student loans (these are just coming out of deferment so the payments haven’t started back yet) - $400, but will go down to $120 with the income used from our taxes (Federal only, $24,400 left)
IRS taxes - $150 (this hasn’t started yet… we just filed last week. One of his PT jobs is for a real estate investor and he never thought to do the quarterly tax payments. The total is only $690 though, so it’s nothing unmanageable)
Realtor fees - $300 (though I believe – and I hope - that he is dropping this because it’s been such a waste of money. He only does it PT, but he is looking to go work with someone in the commercial side and he can wipe out all but $89 of this)
Rent - $1814 (we’ll be moving in June as our rent increase is going to skyrocket, and it’s not worth it to live out in the suburbs for that much a month)
Parking - $70
Pet Rent - $50 (for one dog… it is the stupidest thing I have ever heard of)
W/S/G and Electric usually end up being around $150 (it will go down significantly when we move back into the city as Seattle City Light used to average us $15 every two months)

And then for ones that change or are not regular – 
Groceries we average anywhere between $600-700. And that’s way down ever since I started planning our meals out for the week. It used to easily be over $1000. 
Gas is around $125-140 depending on how much he has to drive for the investor job
Work food/coffee for both of us is between $40-50
Dog/Cat food and cat litter – About $50-60 a month depending on the size of the dog food I buy. 
Going out with friends/eating out/etc has been about $150 a month. We try to eat before going out with friends to keep the cost down, but every once in a while I get tired of cooking and need a break (His main job is 1-9:30pm M-F so we can’t really take turns)
I bus to work, which is $132 a quarter for my pass. We also have a ZipCar membership, but I really only use it once or twice a month for a couple hours at a time. Usually $25 a month total as I don’t really ever need it (a benefit of living across the street from two grocery stores)

We take home $5300 a month after taxes. I know he contributes to a retirement and a 401K with his main job, though I don’t know the amounts. I contribute 5% to my retirement plan and my employer contributes 9%. I was working in two different offices at the same place (50% each), but one of them had a lack of work so now I’m only doing 70% at one office, so our income decreased by about $350 a month. My position here is up for renewal and possibly a bump to 100% depending on the budget passing, which would also mean a salary increase and will bring our income back up. There's also a Traditional IRA for him, and I have a Roth IRA, but I just set that up the other day and it has a whopping $75 in it. 

So that’s all of that. And if you add up all those numbers, you’ll see that there’s basically nothing left per month. Freeing up even just the car payment would be a big help, but then I really don’t know what the best option is for the rest of it. I thought to just pay off the cards with the highest balances, which we could then snowball those payments into the smaller ones and get those paid off sooner as well. But there’s the IRS fee that we could just pay off completely. But, like I said earlier, we are planning to move in June, which will have fees associated with it. It will just be security/pet deposits (and the cost of moving all our stuff), so we won’t have to worry about first/last/security – those are usually done by single family rentals and not from a complex. Do we use some of that stock money and put it into savings for moving? Or since we’ll have that extra money every month if we pay off the car and some credit cards, we can throw that into it? And if/when he drops those ridiculous realtor payments that will free up another $200. So I’m not really sure what to do with any of it… I have a lot of ideas for it, but I don’t know if any of them are actually GOOD ideas or if they all suck. Any thoughts on this novel that I've just wrote would be appreciated.",finance,1426621011

I'm looking for some solid advice and insight with out a biased opinion on my life choices on how I can be successful in my future.

So I recently graduated college with a BFA (that's a fine arts degree) with no job prospect. Mistake... I know... but the deed is done and I have to deal with the damage. I have no idea how much in debt I am with student loans but my guess is around 50k. I think two of the loans are personal loans, and the rest are all federal. And I would like to know where I can find this information at, as it seems a lot of my loans have been bought off by different companies etc...

I decided to go back to school and get an associates degree in Administrative Assistance, so I can actually have a skill that will last the rest of my life. Right now, I am going to school on full grants so I'm not accumulating anymore debt.

I'm extremely worried though about when I graduate, and finding work and if I'll be making enough to pay off my debt and live comfortably. 

Based on looking at jobs in this field, the starting pay is between 10-16/17 an hour. 

I want to know from others who have been in a similar situation, what it is like to pay off the debt. I want to know, how much, minimum, I'd have to pay monthly.

My current living situation is as follows; I live with my boyfriend who pays rent completely while I am in school. For that I am forever grateful. As soon as I get a full time job, I plan on splitting rent and bills with him, but at the moment that isn't possible. I only work part time and make barely enough to cover my own personal bills such as phone, gas, insurance, and we split grocery bills. 

The only entertainment things I pay for are xbox live, netflix, and just now I started playing WoW with my boyfriend. Other than that, I don't really buy much for myself. But sometimes I do like to have a little getaway because I am extremely depressed and I like to give myself something to look forward to.

As far as my future plans, I would eventually like to buy a house, but nothing big. In the mean time I am ok with living in an apartment, but if possible I would like to upgrade to something nicer. We currently live in a  1 bedroom, and about a 20 minute drive from the biggest city... which is another huge expense for me because no buses come out here and any jobs that I can get are going to be a commute. 

We are not planning on having any children either, if that makes a difference.

I should also mention that starting this September, I will no longer have health insurance under my parents because I am turning 26. I don't know what my options are entirely but I am part native american, and my tribe is Bad River and I am still a student so if there is something out there for me that would be great.",finance,1426622832

investing,Effects of rising rates and the anticipation of rising rates on floating rate corporate bonds.,"I've been thinking about starting a position in a floating rate bond fund in anticipation of rising interest rates. I am trying to find a relatively safe place to park some money while I wait for the knee jerk reaction in the market when rates rise (assuming they do). I would then assess the situation and move accordingly.  
  

My thinking is that the fund which keeps 80% of it's investment in floating rate corporate bonds and 20% in varying parts of the corporate debt structure would not be hit by a short term rate rise. However in doing my due diligence I learned that floating rate bonds usually correspond with the LIBOR as opposed to the treasury yield. Even so I feel like they would still be either unaffected or positively affected by a rise in short term rates.  
  
Is this logic sound? Can someone help me think through correlations with the LIBOR and the treasury rate? I don't know very much about the LIBOR. I'm doing my own research but I thought I'd check here as well to see if anyone had any insights.",finance,1426628527

personalfinance,21 Year old University Student need financial advice,"When I was first starting University, I had to take out a line of credit with a bank in order to pay for my tuition which meant that I would also have to pay a monthly interest. I did not get any funding from OSAP because my father's income was too high. That being said I am completely financially independent. My parents are not paying for my education. 

Three years later, I am now 30, 000$ in debt with the bank. I have a monthly interest rate to pay which is about 130$ a month. I also have a credit card that has an owing balance of 500$. 

I am a full time student and I work as a teaching assistant part time so the paycheck I get bi-weekly is not enough to pay for my bills. Therefore, I end up missing the payments, and have to pay the late fee. I am aware that this is very bad for my credit but  right now I do not have any other options. 

I have contacted the OSAP office and told them about my situation and I was told that I would not be given any funding. They suggested that I go to multiple banks and take out another line of credit. That is not an option that I would like to take because once you get into that cycle of borrowing and paying interest, it adds up,and it is very hard to get out of.

The refinance amount was set to be ~$152,000 with the closing costs rolled in.  My concern is that with the lower appraisal, I will not be able to refi, since 80% LTV only gets $148,000.  I could bring the cash to closing, but at 3.0% financing would rather leave it where it is.

First, are my concerns valid?  If so, is there any course of action to take, other than simply bringing the cash to closing?  Is it normal for an appraiser to use an ""opinion of site"" value instead of simply going off recent comparable sales?  Any advice is appreciated.",finance,1426631354

personalfinance,(Late 20s - 55k salary - 102k debt) - Does this budget &amp; debt repayment plan make sense?,"I've resolved that this is the year I begin paying down my debt. I signed up on Mint.com in February to budget &amp;amp; track my income and expenses and to help me figure out where I can afford to cut back and pay towards my debts.  
  
**Income: About $3500/mo net pay**  
  
**Loan breakdown:**  
Federal student loan: $52k @ 6.8% DEFERRED. 
Federal parent loan: $16k @ 6.8% (parents took this out for me with the intent that I pay it back, not them)  DEFERRED. 
Private student loan: $5.8k @ 7% - $55/mo min. 
Auto loan: $22k @ 5.7% - $376/mo min. 
Credit card: $5k @ 16% - $100/mo min
  
**Expenses (all per month):**  
Rent + water: $900  
Electricity: $110  
TV/Internet - $115 (currently trying to reduce this)  
Cell: $75  
Gas: $80  
Car + renters insurance: $130  
Car payment: $375  
Groceries: $400  
Gym: $35 (fully reimbursable by my employer)  
Dry cleaning: $45  
  
Here's my philosophy towards repaying my debt as of right now. I welcome any and all critique to my thinking here. FYI both of my federal loans are in deferment and I should be able to defer them another couple of years...you'll see why I want to do this below.  
  
**Pre**: I'm currently saving $250/mo in automatic transfers into my savings account and I contribute 5% (max employer match) to my 401(k). Starting January 2016 my income should increase significantly and expenses should decline significantly - my girlfriend will be removed from my health insurance plan to get her own ($150/mo currently out of my income) and we will be splitting all rent/utility/TV-Internet, etc. expenses. Rent drops to $550, electricity to $55, TV/Internet to $50 or less, etc. Plus I'll get a raise around this time.  
  
**First**: Credit card &amp;amp; private student loan. I can't defer either of these payments and they're also the highest interest rates of all my debt, so I figure paying these off first is best. I'm trying to get them both 100% paid off by March 1, 2016 (credit card first obvy). I've already paid $2200 since Feb 1. I can't sustain that pace but I'm throwing every spare dollar I have at it.  
  
**Second**: Start: March 1, 2016. Auto loan. By March 1, 2016, my auto loan debt should be somewhere between 16k-18k. Considering the freed up cash and additional income I will start receiving in Jan 2016, I'd like to pay off the auto loan in full by March 1, 2017. During this time my federal student loans are still on deferment.  
  
**Third**: Start: March 1, 2017. Federal student loans. Assuming I can still continue to throw ~$15k-17k per year at these they'll be paid off in 4-5 years.  
  
Do my savings &amp;amp; repayment plans make sense? Would you forgo the $250/mo cash savings in favor of more debt repayment? I have almost $1000 saved up so far this year, plus I keep a buffer in my checking account between $2000-$3000 that I never drop under for any reason. I don't know why I do this...I guess it's a mental thing. If I drop below those numbers I get anxious. Side effect of living in poverty for years while in college I suppose. So I guess you could say I always have at least $3k cash on hand - $1k in savings and at least $2k if not $3k in checking AFTER all bills and expenses are paid.

My goal is to get out of debt obviously but at some point I'd like to start savings towards a house, too.  
  
Anyway, any and all comments are welcome. Interested in hearing if my plan has me headed in the right direction or if it needs tweaking.  
  
Thanks.",finance,1426648959

2) Is there a keyword to find people who have done so or haven't done so (basically, is there precedent)? 
3) What are the pros/cons/practical concerns of doing so? Note: I would still like to contribute to the economy and improving the world, so becoming a hobo in the woods is not the solution I'm looking for.

This is more of an exploratory post than something I think I will actually try to do. I treat my credit card as an easy transaction method for my checking account, so I do not have credit card debt (as far as I know) and presumably my credit card score is in decent shape. My primary bank is a credit union (and I think they're great), but I still have a Visa credit card. Lately I've been feeling pretty fed up with the whole credit system, after reflecting on how weird it is that Bank of America reps receive more training in empathy and conflict resolution than any of my friends do in the public school system, and I've been wondering, if I have enough cash-flow in my pool of friends and family to buffer removing myself from the credit system, can I do so?

It seems like I can buy plane tickets with paypal and buying groceries with google wallet may soon be at thing. It seems like it might suck if I find myself in a foreign country and run out of money, so I'll have to be a little careful. I guess I can't spend lots of money on a fancy house, but if I don't make enough money or am not able to borrow enough from friends, I can settle for building my own tiny house (and it'd be adorable!). I'm not super sure what else credit is used for. Maybe it'd be nice if I wanted to open my own business or startup -- do VCs look at your credit score? 

There's no way to contribute into a better health insurance system or a better tax system, but at least it seems plausible with credit systems that I can ""vote with my feet"" so to speak. Please let me know if I'm missing something obvious.",finance,1426650663
personalfinance,Help! Does our situation seem feasible?,"Hi Everyone,

I've been a longtime lurker in PF but this is my first time posting. I'd like any insight, suggestions, or general thoughts about my wife (26) and my (26) current financial situation. We have quite a bit of Student Debt that feels very suffocating at times. 

My Loans:
$2,796 (Private) at 3.91%
$6,582 (Private) at 3.41% 
$11,760 (Private) at 4.41%
$25,792 (Direct Sub Consolidated) at 6.125%
$20,774 (Direct Unsub Consolidated) at 6.125%

Wife's Loans:
$5,108 (Parent Plus) at 8.5%
$21,843 (Parent Plus Consolidated) at 8.25%
$44,218 (Direct Sub Consolidated) at 6.5%
$42,570 (Direct Unsub Consolidated) at 6.5%

Both my wife and I have already applied and qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness. We are both making the adjusted payments on our federal loans, and are set to have our loans forgiven in March of 2024. I'm fairly nervous about this part of our finances. Neither of us are likely to leave our respective fields anytime soon, but something about the program not being guaranteed to stick around worries me since our balances continue to go up by making the adjusted payments. 

Our loans come to the monthly payments of:
$363- Wife's private loans
$314- Wife's federal loans
$42- My federal loans
$148- My private loans

We just paid off one of my wife's private loan of $6,100 at 8.75%. Within this month we will be paying off her private loan of $5,108 completely. My parents have graciously agreed to loan us $22,000 on their home equity line at a locked in rate of 3.74% fixed (much better than the 8.25% that's been killing us)

Our other bills include:
$150/month- Cell Phone
$700 (per year)- car insurance for both cars
?- Our monthly groceries and eating out. This is admittedly where we can tighten up. 
$100- our dog (food and medical)

It is also worth noting that last year we had some expenses that were not typical. We got married and ended up paying around $18,000 total for everything (please don't criticize the past, we agreed about what we wanted for that day and are happy with the choices we made). Our dog also required surgery last year totaling around $7,000 (again, our personal choice to do this. She was only 7 months old and was a part of the family by then. Her surgery guaranteed her many more years with us). My wife's car also required repairs totaling around $2,000. While we handled these random costs well enough, they did hinder our ability to throw more money at the loans. 

Our income includes:
$1,700/month after taxes and deductions- me
$2,300/month after taxes and deductions- my wife's full time job
$250-350/month- my wife's part time job; just started this month
My job also includes our apartment and all utilities, as well as a small meal plan that subsidizes all of my lunches and 1-2 dinners a week for me and my wife. I can expect to have these perks for the next 2-3 years, after which the next career step should pay around $15,000 more per year. However, my job also hinders me from having much flexibility for any part time work. Though, I am considering applying to get paid hourly to ""tutor/proof"" papers for online high-schoolers. 

We currently have around $23,000 in our bank account, soon to go down after paying off the $5,108 private loan. We try to stay around $20,000 in case of emergency. My wife and I both contribute %5 of our incomes to retirement (meeting both of our employer's matches; not included in the above income numbers). I also have an HSA account that gets $50/month from my paycheck (not included in the income I listed) and $30/month from my employer. 

I basically want to know if we are ""alright""? My wife's car is going to need replaced within the next 6-12 months, and we desperately want to begin saving for a house/condo (we are happy if we can afford something in the $100k-150k range) and a baby within the next 4-5 years. 

Our plan is to pay off the $5,108 private loan this month, pay off the $21,843 private loan with my parent's home equity this month, and focus on that loan first (I realize it's a lower interest rate but don't want to put my parents out longer than we need to). We then plan to focus on my private loans. Is it smart to ignore the Federal Loans and continue making the adjusted payments to qualify for PSLF? It makes me sick when I see our balances going up each month on those loans. 

I welcome thoughts, suggestions, and constructive criticism. Thank you!!",finance,1426650755

* Student (another 1.5 years to go) with a government loan in AUS ($45K by the time I graduate?). This means there's no interest on the loan, its just indexed to inflation. Otherwise it'll start coming out of my paycheck when i get a job after graduation (two years away). 
* I have my own excel spreadsheet that tracks all my expenses and helps me save/keep on top of my finances. So far in the last two years I have saved over $15K while only making $50K in those two years
* I work as a tutor so all my income is variable. I earn anywhere from $500 - $3000 a month
* I don't have a budget per se. My spreadsheet tells me where I've traditionally spent money and I use the info to estimate how much I'll need but I don't control it with a budget. I'm trying to convert to YNAB or similar program to control it better.
* I live out of home and pay rent at $200pw (oh Sydney...)
* I have one credit card which I use to kind of build a credit rating or whatever its called

So my major problems are that I'm not sure what to do with the $15K of savings. Interest rates are currently so low (3.4%) that I'm basically making about $40 a month. Seems like I can do better but I have no clue how to trade in shares and I don't really want to pay fees. I'm kind of risk averse. 

On the other hand, I've never properly travelled and would love to go for a few months around South America/Europe. At least before I start working full time. BUT I really want to be on my way to owning a home so I want to be able to save so I can put a deposit down (I'm thinking within 5 years of being in the workforce but obviously this is variable depending on my income then). 

Other considerations are that while I don't need a car at the moment, I can definitely see it as something I would want in the future. Again, dependant on where I will work but as an engineer I could easily end up with some travel needs. 

Lastly, I don't like the debt situation but I realise that I'm a) damn good at avoiding it in general (never had debt aside from the current student loan, even though I've had some major surprise expenses in the past) and b) damn lucky to have the opportunity to go to uni on a non-interest bearing loan that will eventually just come out of my pay-check (and as Whittucker taught me- money you don't see is money you never had). But still, why not start chipping away at the debt?

So the question is- how should I play my cards. It's interesting that I don't come from an affluent family and generally we never had the money to pay for the things I wanted so I grew up wanting very little. Now that I have worked and have the money I don't know what to do with it, even just for general spending). Any advice? I have goals but I don't know which should take priority and I can't see me being able to achieve all of them at the same time! 

Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,Need some simple advice for how to handle this small windfall I've had (23M),"I should first point out that I do live in Canada, but I don't think that should affect anyone's advice. Anyways here goes,

Long story short, I got $4,100 in backpay for child survivor benefits.

I currently live with my dad and pay him $500/month in rent. I know it seems high but we like the house we have so I don't mind helping pay the mortgage. I don't know my actual credit score but I know it's horrible because I had some money sitting in collections last year, I was super late on credit card payments, and I went 6 months with no student loan payments. As of today, I paid off the collections about 8 months ago and I called the student loans office during the same time and paid 6 months worth of interest so my account was in good standing and now that I'm back in school, that loan is frozen for now so I haven't been worrying about it. 

My current debt:

~$2,150 credit card at @ 24.95%.

Other than my student loan accruing, that's the only debt I have. I know that interest rate is insane but I'm in school but I made double the minimum most months and just the minimum on months where I'm broker. I also have ZERO savings. 

What I was thinking about doing is using the $3,993 to completely pay off my credit card debt and tuck the remaining $1,800ish away for if I ever want to move out then I'll have first and last ready, but then the thought of paying down half my credit card and using the remaining $3,000 to buy a cheap little car to get me around. I have a free transit pass from the college that I use every day now, but the thought of having a car again is a nice thought. 

What's really the best way I can use this money to help out my future self and get a good credit score back?",finance,1426677287

Should I max my state income tax withholding this year for a guaranteed 15% return?","My wife isn't 100% comfortable with me completely stopping work.  Understandable, since so far none of my side project produce income, and we have 3 kids.  We have a target dollar figure where she'd be comfortable testing what it's like having me home more, by going down to three days a week of work, with the corresponding paycut.

In my endless effort to squeeze as much out of the IRS as possible, I'm wondering if it makes sense to put my state income tax withholding high (file a W-4 that has my employer withhold far more than is necessary).  My thinking is that next year I'll be in a 0% marginal rate:

* My gross salary will drop to ~$60k
* I can easily contribute more to my HSA and 401k than I receive in dividends, interest, and capital gains
* Therefore, I'll qualify for a 10% saver's credit
* 10% of $18k+$11k (401k+IRAs) more than covers my tax owed

If I *am* in a 0% rate, then paying taxes on state income tax refunds will be easy (no tax).  Since I itemize, any state income tax withheld this year a) can't be invested, but b) saves me 15% in federal taxes.

So, does increasing my state income tax withholding give me a guaranteed 15% return (actually, 17.6% now that I think of it, 1/0.85)?  Is this a well-known trick?  Is there a limitation on how much I can have withheld?  If I knowingly set my W-4 too high, is that illegal/unethical?

I'm not very close to my mother or her children (step siblings).My mother has been on welfare and other federal/state benefits for as long as I know.    To be blunt, the three of them aren't exactly a net positive for society in their current state.  My mother would even agree that I'm the one positive thing she's done (or tries to take credit for, anyways).  So, there's that.


My step-siblings are both 20+ years of age and are still not doing the greatest with their lives... brother just moved to florida and sister still lives with mom.  The only bright light is my brother, who has had his run ins with johnny law and has even spent some time in jail (pot...nothing serious), recently moved to florida to be with a girl he had (at the time) recently met whom was already pregnant.  For whatever reason this made him 'see the light' and he appears to have gone gung-ho responsible in preparation for fatherhood.  So, there's a chance that he may turn his life around.  I'm optimistic for this but would also prepare for the worst - which is likely.   
I say this to show that I will most likely be the person who ends up with any bills, and 100% of them, associated with my mother.

personalfinance,Just paid of my credit card debt. Advice on how to proceed.,"As the title suggests, I just paid off my $4K credit card balance. Aside from my mortgage, I currently have $11K debt in car one (6.99% Int), $10K in car 2 (7.74%), $11K in wife's student loans (~6%), and $6K in my student loans (~6.5%). With that in mind, here is my plan:

I was paying $400/month to the credit card. I am going to roll that $400 payment in car 2 because it has the highest interest rate. That would bring the payment up to around $700/month, most of which will be applied to principle. The idea is to get that paid off quickly. When car 2 is paid off, I will take that $700/month and roll that into car 1 until it is paid off. I will continue to roll payments into the next debt to get them taken care of quickly. 

While this does limit my financial flexibility in the short term, I feel it is going to give me a HUGE advantage long term. If I maintain my current debt payment and do not incur any additional debts, I am still able to squirrel away $1K/month and add 5% of my income (w/ 5% employer match) to my 401K. Anyways, I would like to get some input to see if there is a better way to handle my debt short term while still keeping an eye on the future. Thanks!",finance,1426688148
investing,Bond funds: how is pricing affected by rate changes and speculation?,"I know the basics: when rates go up, bond prices go down, generally equivalent to a percent equal to the duration multiplied by every 100 basis points.  So if the fed raises rates 1%, and my bond has a 5 year duration, I could reasonably expect my bond to decrease in trading value by 5%.  However, I'm not interested in holding actual bonds, but rather bond funds (considering AGG ETF)

My question pertains to how much of this translates to index ETFs that track a huge index of thousands of bonds, how long this takes to happen, and also how the price can be affected by other factors.  For instance, in my example above, if the Fed introduces that 1% hike on a certain day, does my AGG fund lose 5% that same day?  I suspect not...  Does it usually happen over a period of time before the date, after the date?  How long of a period of time does the change typically occur over?

Also, to what degree are bond ETFs affected by supply/demand in addition to the actual rate hike?  Can an ETF even be affected by additional supply/demand issues, if it tracks an index?

Bonds are a bit of a mystery to me, but I'm eager to learn.  I know people hate bonds right now, but I'm asking for my parents, who are holding almost all cash in their 401k.  We want to put the money to work, but it's a tumultuous time for bonds, so I'd like to understand the risks of buying into bonds right now.  Of course, they'll be buying into some stocks as well.

My GF and I moved in together almost a year ago and since then I've been trying to help her with her finances and budgeting, as it's not one of her strengths. One the things I want to help her with is reducing the amount she has to pay on her student loans. 

To be honest I'm not very knowledgeable in this area, as I was fortunate enough to graduate without any student loan debt. But based on what she still owes vs. what she's paid it seems like she is being raked over the coals - but that just be my naivety.

She graduated in 2012, but deferred payment for a year. Her original Loan amount was $14k (disbursed) at 6.8% interest rate and she currently owes $11.2k - which seems crazy to me given that she has made $6.9k in total payments to date. Unfortunately I think some of this is due to the deferment, as it looks like the total owed ballooned to $15,350 before she ever paid anything. I think she believed the deferment was an interest free deferment (wouldn't that be nice!), but it doesn't appear that way.

I recently got a sizable bonus at work, that combined with mine and her savings is enough for us to pay off the $11.2k in full (and still have an emergency pool). I'm wondering if that would be a smart move and also if there was any way we could negotiate with Great Lakes on lowering the total amount owed if we should pay in one lump sum.

gaming,Why Limited Edition Consoles Aren't Just A Cash-Grab,"To begin this editorial, I want to first clarify that I’m speaking specifically to the value of limited edition consoles that do not offer added benefit with regard to storage, speed, or hardware size.  Similarly, I am not considering limited edition consoles that are priced above present market value for standard consoles.  It’s obvious that there is added benefit to a console that is cheaper or performs better.  I am making a case for the value of a limited edition console as compared to a mass-produced console of equal spec and price.

I have a friend who just purchased a Monster Hunter limited edition 3DS to replace his old 3DS.  The consoles are different cosmetically, but in every other aspect they are identical.  In my friend’s case, he can justify the expense because he is a big Monster Hunter fan and therefore gets more enjoyment from the console now that it is themed.  For that reason, his console already holds greater value and doesn’t need more justification to purchase.  That said, my friend’s situation got me thinking about whether or not I would receive any added benefit for owning a limited edition console myself.

I am not a fanatic for any game.  I enjoy many different titles, but none of them are really enough to justify – on their own – the purchasing of a new/replacement console which matches the game thematically.  So is there any incentive for me to buy a limited edition console?  I did some research and was very surprised to learn that limited edition consoles actually do hold greater value on both the primary and secondary market.  This debunked my theory that “collectibles no longer retain value on the secondary market.”

I’ve long believed the reason comic books, toys, and other collectibles have large secondary market value is because collecting – as a hobby – was not widely practiced by older generations.  This made mass-produced products of old a rare commodity today and therefore increased the value of those products considerably.  Now that collecting is more popular, the rarity of collectible items is considerably less and therefore the value of collectibles, overall, is declining with time.  For some industries, my theory holds true (comic books, in particular, will not retain value now that there are 3 printings and 12 variants for each first edition – any individual book will serve as 1/20th of the “collection”), limited edition video game consoles are actually quite different.

Credit needs to be assigned to the video game console manufacturers for truly limiting the quantities for several consoles.  1 in every 15 or 20 consoles off the assembly line will print to the LE design and the manufacturers cap the quantities at a fixed total.  The LE consoles are numbered both on the box and on the console itself to ensure authenticity and the distribution of those consoles is randomized and non-sequential (meaning you could theoretically find number 1-of-10,000 and 8,000 – of – 10,000 sitting next to each other on the shelf of your local GameStop).  This practice of manufacturing and distribution has been common practice for the toy industry for decades and was rightfully copied by the console industries in recent years to help increase the collectability and distributed value of their products.

Ok, so you get an early print of a limited edition console… does that mean you have to keep it in the box to retain its value?  Short answer here is, yes… yes you do.  That said, if you’re buying the console to actually play it (mind-boggling, I know), the LE console retains value better than mass-produced units even when taken out of the box.  This is because LE consoles almost always thematically correspond with a popular gaming title.  So while the value of an older video game console decreases with age, the fanbase for any  popular gaming title will eventually level out to a consistent percentage of the gaming community.  With this consistency comes added value and that value will grow as the community slowly fades.  In marketing, we call this value trend the “oxygen value.”  I’m not positive how the name became popular, but someone explained it to me as: “The less oxygen there is in the world, the fewer people will be around.  As the oxygen continue to diminish, the relative value of that oxygen grows despite the consumer audience shrinking at – perhaps – a more rapid rate than the oxygen’s depreciation.”  I don’t know if that’s completely true, but it sound somewhat correct.

On the other hand, LE consoles released in conjunction with a bad game will project to be MORE valuable than consoles coinciding with popular titles.  Marketing agencies coined this market trend the “ugly boy value.”  Again, I don’t know the origins of the marketing term’s name, but the theory suggest that unpopular collectibles are instantly more valuable than popular ones because they are purchased in lower quantities initially, will have shorter production runs, and therefore rarer on the secondary market.  This theory helps explain why the most valuable NES game of all time is Family Fitness Stadium Events.  I don’t know of any present examples of LE consoles that are based on unpopular games, but if you happen to see a limited edition Xbox One featuring Fighter Within – I’d recommend picking that bad boy up.

Anyway – in short, when you buy a LE console, you can find considerable secondary value for that console provided you do your homework and find the correct market to shop it.

Great – so now you know you can get more for your LE console when you eventually resell it.  But what if you aren’t concerned with resale value?  Is there any added benefit to owning the LE console in terms of present value?  Again, the short answer here is “yes.”  Much like a car, a video game console is subject to instant and rapid depreciation.  The second you turn on your console for the first time it will have depreciated between 28% and 52% depending on  when – in the relative lifecycle – you purchased it.  Depreciation not only reduces the value of a console on the secondary market, but it also makes the present value decrease as well.  LE consoles help protect the present value by allowing manufacturers to sell the console at a fixed MSRP for longer.  While you may THINK you want to buy the console for the lowest possible price, regardless of what the price will be the next day, I assure you this is misguided thought.

Consider the automobile market for a minute.  There is an air of trepidation and second-guessing when it comes to buying a car.  This is because the car market is constantly in flux with a lot of buying factors to consider such as list price, interest rates, trade-in values, and features/trim levels.  Unless you know exactly what car you want and are willing to buy it at top-of-market trim level, then your price could fluctuate as much as 15% from one day to the next.  This is a volatile market that is catering to the ebbs and flows of consumer demand and has been operating this way for decades.  The console industry helps avoid the rapid depreciation by releasing limited edition consoles which keep interest high and maintain market value without changing the performance level.  While it’s more common for consoles to come bundled with a game, the LE console achieves the same value retention effect (LE consoles are typically priced $50 above MSRP and include a game, so I guess technically it’s a $10 value, but for all intents and purposes the value is identical).  Therefore, your support of LE consoles help you and the rest of the gaming community avoid being ripped off by fluctuating and varied pricing patterns.  This is a present value-add.

At the end of the day, if you’re debating whether or not to get a limited edition console, logic would indicate it is a sound investment provided you – at some point – intend to buy the game featured in the LE bundle.  A LE console holds a better present and future value to the consumer and has the potential to return profit if left unopened.  While there is data to implicate that many limited edition collectibles are an underhanded way of milking more money out of the consumer for a variant product costing little or nothing additional to develop (looking at  you Madden Football), LE consoles are often sold at the same MSRP / MAP which means they are certainly more collectible and more valuable than their mass-produced counterparts.",technology,1426703320

What questions should I ask?
Currently he says he can save me $140,000 against my mortgage total interest.

This software is sold by some company called United First Financial.

Says the software does the following:

* Applies payments to specific days because interest is calculated daily.
* Also have to calculate optimized time to take money out of savings to make payments.
* Uses algorithm to work against banks’ financing algorithm.
* Program helps you put money into savings and then apply lump sums at strategic times.
* It adjusts based on income fluctuations. If you get paid less one month it changes your projections.
* It budgets above whatever set savings reserve you determine and then allocates money above your reserve for pre-payments.
* Suggests delaying payments to accrue interest before making payments, but not so much that I incur penalties.
* If I don't make payments exactly as optimized it looks like the impact is minimal.


I've asked for a comparison of just $500 applied monthly to principal vs $500 used via their optimization. Getting to that now. On a $200,000, 30 year mortgage with 6% interest rate and an extra $500/month paid, I would cut the length of the loan in half. Waiting to see how their optimization compares.

The example got too complicated. We compared using my actual mortgage, his software claims to save me $32,000 vs just making a $500/month payment into my principal.",finance,1426717268

What I was thinking about doing was paying everything 100% except for the credit card I pay for everything with and pay off at the end of the month. Then if I wanted to buy anything big I'd ""borrow"" it from myself, from an extra savings account and then pay myself back in the savings account by keeping track of how much I ""owe"" myself.

personalfinance,Help Me Get out Debt,"Hey Guys,
So my goal is to be out of debt in one year. I'm an Engineer with a good paying job. Right now I am and have been making all of my minimum loan payments. I know it's stupid not to put more down on interest if you can, but I had taken out a car loan fresh out of college desperate for a car for my job, and was paying that off in three years instead of ten, so all of my extra money was going towards paying that off.

As of my current new job/raise I can make all of my minimum payments plus an extra $1,150 a month towards student loans.   


The issue is the student loans companies are tricky and while some have higher interest rates, they seem to randomly compound some loans that are bundled into my nelnet payments. No matter what I do, they always seem to find a way to cancel out or minimize the amount of money I put down on principal to suck me dry.   

I've looked at how these loan companies have designed my minimum payments to keep me in debt for as long as possible and minimize the amount of principal I'm paying down. I feel hopeless and in over my head.   

So I'm asking, based on the information below, how can maximize this extra $1,150 to give these terrible evil misleading loan companies a kick in the butt and let them know I do not plan to spend the rest of my 20s in debt, and pay off my loans as quickly as possible.

So I want to put a Monochrome 70s TV in the lounge room of our house and have it functional. I was just wondering in General if this block diagram is fairly standard for a monochrome analogue television :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TV-block-diagram.svg

The idea was to bypass the Tuner, IF Filter and Demodulator and hook directly into the composite video line from a Digital set top box. Audio would be fed separately bypassing the FM audio demodulator and straight to the Audio amplifier. Alternatively if this is all too hard I could find a Digital HDTV tuner that has analogue RF out. It just seems that all the monochrome TV sets from this era do not have composite and audio inputs.

I was also going to refresh all capacitors and any broken parts I find. I have a mate that thinks he can tune the receiver to be on frequency if I go the RF route. It must have drifted knowing it's age.

Looking here

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_television_systems#List_of_analog_television_systems

I should be right as long as the set is Pal or Ntsc if I was to go the Digital tuner with RF output route.

Given all of this (and my financial background below), should I exercise my claim and receive the cash? Or given the tax status, should I roll it directly into a traditional IRA? I don't have one established yet fwiw. This distribution would bump me up a tax bracket, but I'll probably be in that bracket next year anyway. 

Further - there is a mandatory 20% federal tax withholding on any distribution I receive, but no requirement for state. Should I withhold nothing for state, and then work on setting that money aside on my own throughout the year? If I could get that money now, generate some return on it, and then pay my state tax from it next year, that'd be a no-brainer wouldn't it? Or would I be subject to some sort of penalty for this?

Overall - net distribution would be about 7000 - 7500 depending on state tax. My plan was to fill my emergency fund up to 4500 - 5000, and then throw the rest at my 6.55% loan. Would this be the smartest use of this money?

(**Financial background:** Age 23, Full time stable job at $45k, about $1400 monthly expenses (incl. $500 in loan pmts), $1k so far in emergency fund, contribute 6% to roth 401k for maximum match of 4.5%, current debt = Car $10k at 5.69%; Student Loans $4k @ 6.55%; $3k @ 5.35%; $3.5k @ 4.25%; $10k @ 3.15%; No CC debt/pay it off every month) 

(While I have you - Would it make sense to let that 3.15% loan go for the full term instead of paying it down early when I reach that stage? Wouldn't I be better off investing any extra money at that point? 3.15% seems very low. Possibly same for 4.25)",finance,1426731695

personalfinance,"24 yr/o with free rent, no major bills or consumer debt and $2,875 monthly after tax pay, how to proceed?","Hi PF!


I know you guys love these kinds of posts since you are so good at providing advice. 

Before I begin I will say this is a throwaway account and I have also already seen this [graphic chart](https://i.imgur.com/fb7Dtmh.png). I still do not know how to proceed with my money. Part of the problem is I don't know what real goal I want to set. I am only barley going to start budgeting. I don't know if I should either invest more, save more for retirement, buy a new car, or save for a down payment on a cheap 100k home to use as a rental home.


I had not been watching my spending or setting any hard goals the past first year of my new job. I had been casually saving a bit. I just bought YNAB and want to get serious about my budget but do not know how to proceed.

I have a 7% deduction for my 401k which is roughly $280 a month. My employer only matches 6% so I hadn't added more. I am also living as onsite manager at an apartment complex aside from my full time job so I pay no rent! My current accounts and bills look like this:


-Savings:   $8,000

-Checking: $2,000

-401k:      $2,460

-Student loans: $16,000

-Internet: $30

-Electricity  $35

-Cell Phone $90

-Gas:   $120

-Food: $200

Those are my rough monthly expenses. My student loans only have 3.5% interest rate with a minimum payment of $85 a month. I had been pumping out $400 a month but I am going to scale back to minimum payment so I can pump the money into an IRA instead. 


I have no major bills but have not been maximizing savings due to lack of budgeting. I have to really take the opportunity right now that I am paying *No rent expenses* and maximize my money. 


My current plans are to open a roth IRA with $2,000, contribute $300 to it monthly and keep adding $1,000 monthly to my savings account. I am scaling down my loan payments to minimum. I am trying to decide on either buying a new ~$25k car as I have an old 1995 toyota T100 truck, it is nearly as old as I am. 

I live fairly close to work so I can bike in 5 minutes. Even though I don't need a car, I would love one and my truck can be a bit embarrassing at times. I almost have $10k in savings so I can try to save $20k for a down payment on a $100k home. I need some advice as I create my new monthly budget. I also see that pumping money into your IRA is recommended before opening a Brokerage account, but is there any benefit to pumping more money into a taxable investment account instead of an IRA? Even though it is taxed, I feel like it is MY money, and not some money socked away in an account I can't touch.



Long post but thanks to all for reading and a sincere thanks for your advice!

I have been a lurker here for a while and have gotten a lot of good info but could use some advice on what to do with my finances as I am about to incur a large amount of debt. (It's an investment of course!)

Background info:
I'll be starting med school this fall. I'll be taking out approximately 65K a year for 4 years. That ~65K will be for tuition and living expenses.

My question has nothing to do with loans but with what to do with my money now.

I currently have:
~10k between my savings and my checking
~14k in 3 high risk mutual funds.

Only debt I have is my car payment which is $320 a month. Remaining balance of about 14K at an interest rate of 1.7%.

I plan to be working till the second week of June and continuing to save religiously.

My plan was to save enough to pay my monthly car payments via my savings. To me, 1.7% does not warrant me paying it off in one lump sum. (Am I wrong?) I definitely will not be using my loan money to pay for my car.

So what now?

worldpolitics,"Low Hanging Fruits, the misconception of Sudan by the ICC.","What does the term, low hanging fruit refer to?

The   things that are easy to get, achieve, or deal with through little effort. It is my opinion that this is indeed initially how the ICC viewed it's battle with Sudan when it's prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo chose it to build his career on, the gold star, the seal of his wonderful legal power and  career acumen, which actually became his achilles heel and in two words, his, 'epic fail'.

There is a strong misconception of Africa in general by the ICC, clearly to continually go after leaders from this region for prosecution and ignore the plights of the rest of the world, there is clearly a bias issue.  Yes, it has served as tool for colonial masters to subdjugate Africa. It's improved lives for how many people? There is no denying, something is needed to uphold the rights and address the issues of the people.  It simply isn't the ICC in it's current format, seemingly more bent on agenda's and vendetta's than acting in the interests of the people it claims to be serving and protecting.

The fact that there have been many reports emerging with each month, week, day of the underhand dealings in trials at the ICC, fake evidence,  the issue of witnesses at trials themselves is an interesting area.  Being in the 'Witness' business can net some tidy sums of money to some parties.  In fact if one did the maths  in some instances, there are more victims suggested in some regions than an area contained in the first place prior to any political issues or uprising, the fact people are driven around, moved on from one tribal home to another, and sometimes, indeed co-erced to be in a particular place much to their detriment  at the end result, to serve an ulterior motive...this is all often overlooked, though known and evidenced.

It is well know in certain circles that Luis Moreno-Ocampo is not as hands-off as the public might believe having served his time at the ICC and no longer being the Chief Prosecutor.

It is well know the pressure he is still able to apply to ensure that even though it may be the logical thing, the obvious thing and in-fact, the right thing to do to invoke article 16 article of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) with regards to the Omar Al Bashir Case, he is adamant that that is not going to happen (like the lover that got away he has yet to get over), his protege Fatou Bensouda has been groomed by him and left in no uncertain terms of which way he expects her to go with this case.

 Enter stage left, his right hand protege Judge Silvia Alejandra Fernández de Gurmendi, charged with keeping Fatou Bensouda on her toes, and after a major fall out recently with Ocampo, has been reminded of the true aims and objectives of their posts.  These guys go way back, if you follow the intrigue of Argentiian politics at the moment you'll know it's ...deep.  Forget for the moment about the sham 'that envelope' -  Kofi Annan, it will all come out over time.

The reason invoking article 16 is a positive way forward? 

Article 16: Deferral of investigation or prosecution

            No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12 months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions. 

Al Bashir states he wants to bring about peace, has been visiting envoys to try to forge this, handing out pardons and building economic stability wherever the West has not been able to hamper him, though they really have tried by every means possible, causing further hardship to the people of Sudan, but that's Western Politics (helping people).

Why not, for the sake of a 12 month period try to bring things forward and work with him as opposed to against him, he's reaching out here, stating he has no intention to remain in power, and trying to rebuild before he goes.  It's not so much an admission of defeat, as a progressing things forward to go for article 16, rather than this game of chase that is getting no where, solving nothing, and meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people suffer.


For people who work with the people of Sudan closely it is sometimes quite infuriating how the rest of the world is fed by a propaganda machine, and as it seems these days, if you say something loud enough, fast enough or get the right celebrity endorsement...well then it must be so.

People claim that the press in the region of Sudan is not free, that it is restrictive and used to convey only the information the leader of the country wants the public to have.

Yet in the USA, UK, Europe and pretty much rest of the world there are continual examples that the press i truly not as free as the inhabitants of those lands believe.  Stories and evidence are buried everyday by editors if they do not support the common propaganda being touted by western politicians.  Between the Western Media and ICC it's a tough battle ground, and yet, Sudan has prevailed. 

 The President, Omar Al Bashir has continued to go about his daily business in the best manner he can, trying to unite his country, lead his country and drive it forwards to better times.  He has come out publicly stating he will step down if he wins the next election at the end of his term, thus giving him maybe enough time to try to reverse some of the damage caused by all the infighting and uncertainty of years gone by.

Mr Bashir has worked hard to continue to cultivate diplomatic ties with other nations, his country benefits signicantly from investment from China amongst other nations. It is a country rich in oil, rich in gold and rich in the resilliance of it's people, embodied by the strength Omar has shown in fighting on to unite his people despite continual threats and calls of arrest from the ICC.

The same ICC which indicted Mr Bashir for crimes against Humanity, has no intention at this stage of actually investigating him.  The Chief Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda in fact came out publicly stating that she was not investigating his case at present and had no immediate intentions of doing so due to lack of funding, support, ok, maybe she could add the word, evidence in there and be more honest.

There have been many things leaked of late and probably are being drip fed to the press at this moment of gross misconduct within the ICC.  The way so called evidence is gathered, prepared, paid for, even falsified.  The racket that protecting / prosecuting Africa has become.

Africa, is not the low lying fruit of the world, but a strong nation, resilient and long-suffering.  Sudan, is most certainly not a low lying fruit in any shape or form. Not the one to make your career on, put your stamp on the world whilst enabling other more sinister global political motivations to be achieved. That in itself is for another post, let's lighten this a little.

investing,Buying a house cash: being truly at home,"Last year I visited a friend in the US, and he had just bought a house for his family. ”Congratulations on buying a house!” I said. He pointed out to a small closet and replied “oh, that closet is ours, the rest belongs to the bank”. Like the majority of households those days, they would spend the next 25 years buying back their house from the bank.

 

At this time, I owned two rental properties but was traveling around so I was really homeless, living out of two motorcycle panniers for 6 months. I was starting to feel the need to settle down, and even better, in a paid for home.

 

Could it be that difficult? Well, yes. First, because prices are higher. Two generations ago, buying a house cash after five years or savings was not unusual. A mortgage would be paid of in ten or twelve years at most. Now we are talking about 25 to 30 years to afford a normal house on a normal salary.

I had to sacrifice a few things in order to acquire a house cash. I chose a country with a low cost of living. I could have afforded a house in France but it would be a ruin in the middle of nowhere and I would have spent the next 5 years fixing it up myself. Here, for as annoyed as I am for having an anthill of workers around my house all day, I don’t have to do the work myself, and they should take three months at most.

 

 

Buying a house cash it not always wise.
 

My mortgage in the UK is at 2.29%. Here in Guatemala, I would have obtained a rate around 8 or 9%, even for a mortgage in US dollars. At 2.29%, I am not repaying my mortgage faster. Like I explained in this post, the average weighted interest rate on my debt load is pretty low, and I would rather have debt and invest my cash than live debt free and have nothing to invest. Of course, down the road, I hope to have no debt and a cash surplus to invest, but for now I need the passive income those investments produce.

IMG_2526

I chose to leverage that cash and channel it into several investments instead of using it to pay off debt. As I mentioned, I own some cattle, a coconut farm, a 90 acres piece of land for development, and am considering other unusual investments, but that is for another post. All those things bring me money already, or should start generating an income tomorrow, that is more than the monthly repayment on my debt. If I paid my 2.29% mortgage in full, I would have to borrow the money again to invest, and it would be considered a consumer loan, for which I expect a rate of 7%.

 

If you have some debt other than your mortgage, killing your mortgage first is probably not financially smart. Your mortgage rate should be your lowest interest debt, and if it isn’t you should look into refinancing because rates have never been so low. You could even borrow more against your mortgage to pay off your higher interest debt. Not to buy more stuff.

 

 

 

But the feeling is truly awesome.
 

I could have chosen to keep borrowing when I bought my little house in Guatemala. Although as a self employed, semi-retired foreign girl, I had virtually no chance to get an approval on a loan. It already took me four trips to the bank to open a savings account, with no overdraft, no checkbook, no credit line. Just for the privilege of lending them my cash for a 0% or 0.1% interest rate, I didn’t bother reading the fine print. Imagine a mortgage.

 

But deep down, I wanted to own the roof I live under. That is the first time in my life that I live in a paid for house. I bought my first property at 23 but it was a rental, and I was renting elsewhere for myself. In the UK, I did live in the property I bought, and enjoyed the fact that I had no landlord to tell me how to decorate or abusively keep my deposit at the end of the tenancy, but most of the property belonged to the bank.

 

As I renovate this house, and build an additional bedroom, I know everything is mine. I never have to pay rent or a mortgage again. I can build more at the pace I can afford to. For now, it is just an extra room, and I hope to have a couple more to run a 4-5 rooms guest house.

IMG_2512

That peace of mind is costing me, since I could have invested elsewhere. This is a luxury I deliberately chose to afford. And it is worth every penny.

Decent financial aid, but did the rest in loans. Got an okay job but half of my monthly take home is going to loans. Then with rent and bills I have very little left over to do anything. And I don't mean just being able to go to my favourite dive bar and grab a drink, I really want some decent financial security in that I have savings and money that I can choose to utilize. In general I just have no idea how anyone in a worse situation than I would be able to handle it, so there has to be a way for things to not seem so overwhelming, but I have no resources to figure this all out for my specific situation.

Financial Information. After taxes I bring home $2072/mo.

I have student loans in 3 institutions.

- $145/mo for a $18,200 total of all my Direct Stafford loans in one institution with interests rates from 3.15%-6.55%

- $166/mo for a $16,500 total for a student loan at a second institution at 7.49%

- $682/mo for a $33,600 total of several loans at a third institution with interest rates from 5.75%-9%


Total for loans is $993/mo.

Rent and bills comes to about $600/mo

Current commute comes to about $244/mo


That gives me $235/mo that I can actually use for any other purpose (food, saving, investing, extra loan payment).

For the security of having more money I can actually utilize, I would really like to lower my loan payments, but have no idea how to do that. I've seen talk of loan consolidation and while I shouldn't touch my Stafford loans with that, would consolidating the others have a chance at a lower monthly payment? I know that kind of thing would make the loan last longer, but as I get my financial house in order I can pump more money into my loans. Right now I need a way to achieve that security. If that is a thing I should consider, who would I even talk to about that? Just any old bank? Specific institution? For the record, I don't know my FICO score, but my Equifax is 750 so I imagine my credit is decent. 

Also, my current commute is a total of 3 hrs/day on public transit. If I drive, that is cut in half even with heavy traffic. That time is pretty valuable to me so I'd really like to buy a car. However, I have no experience in buying and owning a car. Can that $244/mo I'm currently paying be in the same range as what I could pay for a durable used car?

The dealer recommended in a few months of paying on time I re-finance the loan to get a lower interest rate.  I went to my bank (PNC) the other day and filled out the forms to re-finance but got denied because I don't have a large enough credit history (or something along those lines).  They suggested that I could get a co-signer.  My questions to you guys are:  
&amp;nbsp;     
*Note:  I understand that the co-signer takes on risk because if I don't pay it is on them, the co-signer would be one of my parents who have already agreed to co-sign if I want*
   
1)  If I have a co-signer, will it hurt my credit to have them run the application again?     

2) Does it ""look bad"" to have a co-signer, will it affect me in a negative way?     

3) Does it help my credit at all to have a co-signer, or does the co-signer get all of the glory?",finance,1426770724
personalfinance,"Living abroad, owe taxes in the US and haven't paid up in a few years.","I'm living in the UK now, for the last 3 1/2 years, and while here I've not filed any US taxes.

When I tried to on TurboTax I felt very lost with what info I needed to provide and the paperwork I receive here doesn't translate very well with the forms I could find on the site.

Also, when I was last fully employed in the states I had a friend do our taxes that worked for an HRBLock type firm (can't remember the name but big in Kentucky) and she screwed things up horribly.

Left out lots of tax claim stuff related to employee stock purchase/matching and related stuff. Only found out a few years later that it was done wrong and we had a bit more to owe fed/state.

So I need to file on behalf of myself for the last few years and need to figure out how much I owe and need to pay for the previous mess up.

What's the easiest solution to get this sorted and starting the process of paying what is owed?

personalfinance,Somehow got a W-2 from another state! What can we do?,"So my gf got her W-2s from her mom this week (she lives with me, mailing address still with Mom).  She switched jobs, so we expected two... but got three!

She's working for CVS Pharmacy, we live in MN, and somehow there's another W-2 here with the state listed as MI!

She called into CVS Corporate, and after some waiting, she got someone who said -- ""I see a transfer here to Michigan.""  But she's never been transferred, she says, she started at CVS in August and has been in Minnesota ever since.  ""Well, I can see a transfer here, it was approved by &lt;Her old manager&gt;.""  She says, well he's left the company now, what can I do about this.  ""You'll have to talk to your supervisor.""

So she talks to her current manager and New Manager says, ""Just don't pay taxes on it.""  I believe that's terrible advice, I feel like that could have serious ramifications.

So I told her to get back on the phone with CVS Corporate, keyword ""escalate.""  I told her to be calm and polite, but repeat this phrase -- ""This issue needs to be resolved, and if you can't help me, please escalate my call to your supervisor.""

So I come to you, /r/personalfinance.  Has anyone heard of an issue like this before?  Any advice, any precedent?  I think CVS Corporate will be the only company who can fix this issue.  In the case that it takes some time, can she get an extension on submitting her taxes to the IRS this year?  Or should she get in contact with the state/federal IRS or someone else to resolve the issue itself?",finance,1426773153

personalfinance,Advice to get back into college?,"I am currently a college drop out (not by choice), and need some advice for possible options I have for returning to school. Here's some background information:

* I graduated high school in 2013, after being accepted to Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). During part of my high school years I was considered homeless from around 2011-2014. My mother got laid off which forced us to live in a motel for those years. Fortunately enough for me, I was lucky enough to stay with a friend to finish out my remaining high school years and graduate with a 3.4 (which I think is pretty good considering the circumstances)
* I filed for a FASFA because there was 0 chance in getting any financial help from my parents. I wasn't awarded any scholarships and had no savings. Through the FASFA I was awarded roughly ~$10,000 for the year. My classes were roughly ~$7,000 per semester. I lived on campus in their freshman dorm for the first semester.
* Turns out my FASFA was selected for verification. (still not 100% sure what that even means) So I went to Student Accounting to find out what I had to do in order for the FASFA money to be processed and go through. I filed as a dependent because at the time I had no source of income. The Financial Aid office required a few documents that I needed to get filled out / turn in, such as Parents W-2's / 2012-2013 Federal Tax Transcript. 
* I called my parents and asked them to get me these documents, but apparently they've had problems with their taxes in the past few years which made getting their 2012-2013 Federal Tax Transcript an issue. 
* Without the FASFA money processed to my account, I had a hold placed onto my account until that document was returned. I couldn't apply for a loan because I was required to have a cosigner and everyone that I asked either could not help or didn't have strong enough credit.
* I reached out to the President of Student Affairs, the president of my department, my student academic adviser, and many others and they've all told me there is nothing they can do without the form turned in. I had a ""1 time student accreditation"" for roughly ~$5,000 applied to my account, but that still didn't cover the Fall 2013 balance, thus still having my account on hold and being unable to apply for Spring 2014 classes until the amount was fully paid.
* I have an older sister who also attends Norfolk State University, and her FASFA was also selected for verification, we have the same information, and her university asked for the same documents. But when she explained to them about being unable to get a Federal Tax Transcript they offered her some type of waiver form that could be accepted in it's place. Hearing about her recent success I also attempted to do the same at my university but did not get those same results.

**TLDR;** 20 yr old college drop out at VCU cannot register for classes until 1st semester is fully paid off. FASFA did not get credited to his student account due to being selected for Verification. Has applied for many scholarships with no success. Cannot receive a student loan without a cosigner (has no willing / able person). Only attended 1 full semester Fall 2013.

Currently my situations have changed a bit. Since July of 2014 my mother and I are no longer homeless, we are both currently working, living in a 2bd apartment, but there is still hardly any leftover money that I can spare to put towards my bill. Last year I filed another FASFA for Fall 2014 - Spring 2015 and was yet again selected for verification. According to Financial Aid office the FASFA I filed for Fall 2013 - Spring 2014 is no longer available to be accessed, so even if they received the Federal Tax Transcript form for that year the money could not be put towards my account, meaning it would take money from my most recent FASFA filing (Fall 2015 - Spring 2016) to cover the remaining bill.

What options do I have? All help is appreciated.",finance,1426776238
gaming,Early impressions of 5-Star Wrestling,"I have followed 5-Star Wrestling as best I can, reading the scant information available from year to year, and quite frankly I was shocked when it materialised on the PSN at a hugely inflated price and with near to zero warning. Both were red flags, as was the developer's facebook status for the release of it being ""not perfect"", but I've been starved of a great wrestling game for so long that despite the pricey ($38au) entry point, I bit the bullet and got the game. The developer had spoken with great reverence for games I considered the pinnacle of wrestling games to date, and had expressed a desire to avoid the pitfalls of the current games to return wrestling games to their previous levels of greatness, and based almost entirely on this I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume the price wasn't a cashgrab, but a necessary evil to cover development costs. With these factors, and some optimism, I hoped the long wait for a great wrestling game to follow No Mercy had finally been bridged, or in a worse case scenario, a decent alternative to the WWE games had come along. 

I've played pretty much every wrestling game released in Australia since WCW Vs NWO on the N64 and a few before that on the SNES and in arcades. The only recent WWE game I didn't play was 2K15 since I finally decided that I'd had enough and I wasn't going to support this meandering series until a true, positive overhaul of the gameplay was evident. My favourite wrestling game is No Mercy by a long way, but all the other AKI wrestling games are solid to great. Not much of a fan of the smackdown games, although HCtP and a couple of others were fun multiplayer fests. Since that series primarily bent towards the ""arcadey"" route, and despite constant revamping and additional features, they never got down and truly fixed the gameplay, even to WWE 2k14 (the last one I've played), I think I've given them a fair chance. When a wrestling game appeared on Gamecube, I played it and they were solidly good. When TNA released a game, I played it and felt horribly misled. Basically, I've got about as good a base of wrestling game knowledge as someone can whose not a developer or who hasn't sampled the japanese variety of games (which I hear are very good). 

I say all that so you can appreciate where I'm coming from when I give the following impression. 

- 5-Star Wrestling is horribly overpriced, terrible in so many ways, and disappointing to the level of being insulting. Others may have a problem with the limited roster, limited match types, and dated graphics, but I knew about these going in from the developer's own interviews, so I was reconciled to them and determined to look past these to the promised gameplay gem underneath, and as such I believe my early assessment is not coloured by these shortcomings.  

- Concerning the wrestling mechanics, the grappling is really loose, with opponents reaching past their opponents when attempting to grapple approximately half the time. 

- The controls are ok, but sporadically responsive for seconds at a time. 

- The physics in the ring are absurd, with wrestlers teleporting about and floating above the canvas near constantly. 

- The ring announcing before the matches is either terrible on purpose (I suspect, since it got a chuckle the first time, but it subsequently became grating), or just bad outright. 

- The music is a highpoint if you like parody entrance music, and I fall in that category, but I suspect others will find it abysmal. 

- The ""hand-modeled animations"" (one of No Mercy's greatest strengths) we'd been promised were there, but only half of them are decent, and the other half are jerky and unnatural in the extreme. I will say that a fair amount look modeled after WWE games from the past and present which is nice, but the bad sadly outweighs the good and few seem truly unique efforts despite the variety.  

- Since this is the main feature promised by 5SW, let's address the gameplay. There is definitely something to the gameplay under the surface. As stated this is a very early impression of the game, and I feel that once I allow for the myriad of bugs and annoyances to wash over me I'll be able to delve deep into the meat of it and find that kernel of decent gameplay that the developer constantly touted in interviews. 

- The stamina system in place seems to be working well, and the reversals I've seen flow pretty nicely, when they work. It's a strange combination of WWE games ""press a button **now** to counter"" philosophy, and button mashing but it's not explained well. You have a steep learning curve evidently, and without much in the way of a tutorial evident it's down to the player to self-educate. 

If I said there's the bones of some good gameplay here, I feel I'd be being extremely optimistic, but it's not entirely untrue. Even so, I would not recommend the game at anything near it's current price which is laughably high considering the lack of polish in nearly every facet. 

TL;DR I had hopes for this game, and I'll be playing it a lot more to truly discern if there's any value to squeeze from it through sheer force of will, but unless you are a completely tragic wrestling game fan who needs to absolutely try every alternative in hopes of finding a great experience, this very sadly should be avoided, or until it drops to a price resembling it's quality which I'd say is about $5.",technology,1426776379

personalfinance,I want to take a loan from my 401k,"Hear me out, but if this idea is crazy feel free to tell me so. 

Here's where I'm at. Nearly 24 years old, been at my full time job just shy of 2 years. I bring home after tax $4,000 a month. I bought a house over a year ago, and after moving in it came to my attention that some serious work needed to be done. I ended up wracking up some credit card debt during this time, and I now have $4,500 in cc debt. I had some budgeting issues, but got it straightened out and am living under my means now. I'm on a 5 year repayment plan for my student loans, so I pay an outrageous amount of money on them each month. Because of this it would take me a year to pay off this $4.5k in debt. The interest rate on my credit card is... 19%. So I'm losing a lot of money on this SOB. 

Good news is, my 401k is doing quite well. I have $12,000 in my 401k. I have been considering taking a loan from that to pay off my debt. If I get a loan from my 401k for $4,500 I can pay it off in a year at $381 a month and only $79 in interest total (I'm rounding, by the way). This is substantially cheaper than making monthly payments on the card, and while I know it is not ideal to take a 401k loan, in this situation it seems like a best case scenario. I'm struggling to find a real down side to this.

My concern is that, if I buy at the end of next year, I'll only want to stay in the place for a few years, which wouldn't be worth buying.  On the other hand, I've also heard it's better to pay down a mortgage than a rent (and interest rates will only go up ...).

I got so fed up with using them that I decided to create my own.

The app is completely free, no advertisements and requires no account (and hence no personally identifiable information).  Some neat things we do:

* Calculate your portfolio’s performance every minute so when you open the app you can at a glance see how your portfolio has done throughout the day relative to the markets.
* Push Notifications for intraday price movements (customizable!)
* Send you a push notification after market close telling you how your portfolio did relative to the DOW, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq.
* Send you push notifications about earnings dates (one week reminders) as well as the reports themselves.
* We have after hours charts -- something I haven't found in many apps.

The problem is I have another interview I will be going to about three weeks from now, and it will take some additional time for them to make the decision. I will need to front the original deposit, and if I get into this second school I will need to submit another $1,500 deposit while losing the initial $2,000 deposit. If I do not get in, the original $2,000 deposit will be applied against my tuition, and I will go about my day.

Young and Dumb, though shouldn't have been as my mom taught me better than this, however I knew just enough to be dumber than others and take on risks I shouldn't have.  
I was in college, age 21, working FT, and my boyfriend of many years just broke up with me (very ugly).  College was going south too, having issues with a professor who targeted me to take out their crap on and fail me in all their classes (was an on-going case with the board for 6mo), in the end I was so depressed I dropped the case, and moved in with who I thought was a childhood friend (rushed into rebound relationship to boot with him).  Bought a car that was like 30K, put the down payment on my CC of 5k @20%, financed the rest of the car at 12.5%, then quit my job. 

 Got an apartment in another city with new boyfriend.  I have no idea how we got approved for it.  It was 1250/mo in rent(we live in a cheap area, so this was considered the best of the best I could have found something so much cheaper).  I had no job and a $400 something car payment to make with no income.  We then took a trip to Vegas, using my cc’s, said he’d pay me back and didn't ever.  He pretended to go to work, day in day out, but when rent came due, no money was available.  I had to cover the whole thing.  At this point, my savings was gone, my cc’s were maxed, and I’m behind on rent.  I get a job, making about $1100/mo after taxes.  My expenses were $2200/mo the way I was living.  I eventually got a second job, making now $1900/mo after taxes.  But I was now working 80 hours a week (2pm-10pm, 30min drive, and 30min for a small break then 12am - 8:30am sometimes 9am with a 1 hour commute home in traffic.  I'd get home at 10am and have to be awake by 12:30 so I could be at my other job again by 2 (1 hour drive in traffic).  I did this 6 days a week for 3 months.  I started falling asleep at work, while driving (had to call people on the phone to keep myself awake driving).  I slept through a shift and they wanted to let me go.  I told them it wouldn't happen again.  It happened again and I just never showed up again.  I slept all the time after this, no matter how much sleep I got, it was never enough, for months.  

 Falling further behind, not making payments, boyfriend comes up with no money for next month either.  I find out he didn’t have a job, he was pretending.  I found this out by going through his mail.  The company he claimed to be working for, I found their rejection letter.  I was so depressed about everything in life at this point, that is part of what drove all my reckless financial decisions.  I wanted to believe someone would come and fix it all, fix me.  I made it so much worse.  My credit was 750, now 500ish.  I had charge offs and my car was in an accident that wasn't my fault and yet I was not even motivated to make the claim and have it repaired, my brand new car.  It was later repossessed.  This was rock bottom at its best, at it's worst was when I had to ask my ex for $20 for food. He had his dad leave it under a rock for me to find.  I was too tired and too depressed to care about the humiliation I felt.  

Today:

How did I get here?
First, I confessed all my financial woes to my family (my mom), which was so hard to do b/c she is super frugal and I just had lost my mind at that time I had nothing left.  The most depressing though was, even if I had been given 10K from a generous person, it barely put a dent in the damage I had caused.  I got caught up in the $100 doesn’t even matter anymore savings or spending cycle.  I had applied to a debt consolidating place and they offered me a great rate of 5% for all my debts.  But first, my mom had me call EVERY collector and EVERY cc I had and ask for a reduced payment for one time payment (to charge off the account/reach a settlement over the phone).  This was a huge reduction in debt.  I reduced I’d say at least 30% of it this way.  I could NOT file for bankruptcy b/c I have a joint trust with some money to my and my sister’s name, which I am not entitled to until I am 45.  If I had it would have taken a big hit and she would have suffered for my mistakes.

Once I finshed that awful process, my mom bought up all my debt and offered me the same rate as the debt company did – she did this to help me improve my credit faster – and to teach me a lesson that no one will bail you out for your mistakes for free – it always costs someone.  She figured she might as well make a good interest rate and help me at the same time.  I am grateful.  Though it was the hardest thing I ever ever had to do.
I now owed her $650/mo for the next 4 years.  Ouch.  I didn’t have a job, didn’t have a degree (though luckily I worked A LOT in college and never had to carry over a loan, but still pretty much wasted the money and time b/c I didn’t even know what I wanted to do anymore – I was studying music.  

I lived at home, but still paid my mom rent at a reduced rate (nothing’s free is the lesson still, even if the other party could afford it), $375/mo which was about the going rate for a place if I shared it with someone.  The area we lived in has super cheap cost of living.  My old high school job heard I had returned to town (we live in a big city so sorta crazy), and wanted me to return to my job as night auditor for the hotel.  The pay was 9.50/hr, FT, no benefits. I was able to start immediately, I also did pet sitting on the side for extra income.  My mom introduced me to envelopes.  I started putting money away into an envelope so I could see how much I was saving in a tangible manner.  I would also save for my purchases and monthly expenses this way.  Make a new envelop each time I had a new desire to do something.  If I didn’t have enough money to go around, something had to be sacrificed.  This was the most important thing I learned using this method.  How MUCH even $5/mo added up, hell that would have funded my haircut envelope.  After 3 mo with my mom, I found 4 dudes sharing a home, I moved in there for $200/mo.  It was a small room, but it worked.  I had my own bathroom down the hall, that is all that mattered.  I have a hard time living with my mom.  I appreciate her, but don’t like living with her.
I continued living in this way for the next 3 years (2005-2008).  

This is when I decided to go back to school.  Though I still had to pay my mom $650/mo and really couldn't afford school and rent/expenses etc. I asked her for help, she said no.  If I couldn't afford to go, I guess I couldn't go.  This was so hard to hear, that my mom wouldn't help me get an education, which she thought was so important in life.  But, her lesson was learned.  I found another super cheap basement to rent from a family with 5! Children. It also had mice (eww).  But it was $200/mo so I took it.  I started with summer school.  I decided on accounting as I liked my job as hotel night audit.  I immediately picked up two jobs in the city my school was in.  Tutoring and a part time assistant job.  I also worked at the event center and did “security” for the football and volley ball games.  They needed female patters lol.  So I suppose I had three jobs all PT. 

 I had medical through school and paid my tuition (cheap cheap state school).  I did my best at school and lived with as many roommates as I could stuff into our places we rented – don’t think my rent was ever more than $400/mo at any given time b/c of this.  I graduated with a 3.0 in finance in the end - took my first finance class and loved it and immediately switched.  Funny b/c now I’m an accountant.

I am now contemplating going back to school to complete the req for my CPA and get a master’s in professional accountancy (MPA) with a focus in fraud management.  I just applied to a part time position as an office manager for real estate agents, for 10/hours per week for extra cash to help defer the cost of my grad school.  Grad school is 19K , plus 2K for 2 additional classes I need outside of it for CPA.  

That is my story.  I hope it inspires, gives hope and proves so many valuable lessons given in this sub each and every day.

personalfinance,Can someone explain to me why a bank account that compounds interest daily doesn't grow daily?,"I moved most of my money over to Ally that I had sitting in Wells Fargo to take advantage of the ~1% APY. On their site, they say that their interest rate is .99%, compounded daily, and that their APY is also .99%. Two questions on that:

1) If the interest rate is .99% and compounded daily, wouldn't that make the APY slightly higher than .99%? I just read a few articles on this and they pointed out how interest compounded daily results in a slightly higher APY, yet that isn't the case here

2) If the interest is compounded daily, shouldn't my bank account grow each day? I suppose I figured since it was compounded daily, they were looking at my balance each day and giving me interest for it, to average out to a yearly .99% return. Can someone explain to me why that thought process is stupid and wrong?

gaming,DLCs and season passes are ruining my gaming experience. And what's up with the 9% tax here in IL!??,"So today I went to Gamestop to pick up Battlefield: Hardline. I have been watching the twitch streams and am really excited to spend the weekend playing it. I wasn't too thrilled about the $60 price tag but I know these days that's starting price for a new game. Then the cashier asked if I wanted to add the season pass for another $50. I declined, but I did take a $3 warranty on the disc after my COD:AW started acting up months into playing. So I'm at about a $65 total. NOPE 9% state (IL) tax jacked that price tag up to $68 and some change! I wasn't thrilled with $60 and now I'm paying nearly $70!
As far as DLCs and season passes go,  I'm fed up with all these games squeezing so much extra $$$ out of our pockets. It seems now every game that comes out you have to fork over an extra $50 just to enjoy the full game. And why do all these games now require hard disk space? So you can fill up your hard drive and go buy a bigger one! I could see maybe $20 extra to enjoy more content but not the price of an entire game! The business practices of the gaming industry is starting to turn me off of being a supportive gamer in the community.

Me and the wife have recently received a letter about debt consolidation.They are (potentially) offering a rate of about 3.25% Here is a list of what we have out in debt right now.

* ~ 3K in credit card debt
* ~ 16k in car loan
* ~ 2k in student loans (wife)
* ~ 28k in student loans (me)

I have very little to no experience with debt consolidation and the details. My very noobish understanding is that you get a loan to pay off all these other parties for a lower interest rate that lowers your monthly payments, but extends the loan.

personalfinance,"Recieved some overdue backpay, not sure how to proceed forward.","Financial situation:
I just recieved back pay that was owed to me in the amount of $6500 (after taxes). I'm currently working overseas and get a financial bonus of approx $1400 (tax free) every month, and I'm managing to save about $2000 a month. My work overseas finishes up in the next 3-4 months, at which point the bonus will obviously cease.

I currently owe $17,500 ($750/mo pymnts) towards a personal loan from the bank (11.75%) and $4000 ($200/mo pymnts)  towards a store credit (no interest). I currently have no credit cards, and managed to save up approx $5500 since January.

My issue is this: I'm currently renting an apartment with my significant other ($1200 a month), and ideally I would like to purchase a home for us in the near future. My father (who is fairly good with finances) suggested that I used the money I save up while overseas to pay off all the debt, or at least all that I can, when I get back. On one hand, I like this thought as it would free up $950 a month and have me debt free, but then I would have to begin the process of saving up fo a downpayment for a mortgage if I still want the house.

The other option that I can see is to use the money I save while overseas to put a sizable downpayment on a house and hopefully attain a lower interest rate in doing so. Of course, the downside is still having the loans hanging over my head for another couple of years.

I guess what I'm asking is which would put me in a better financial state/better for my credit (I had horrible credit a few years ago due to irresponsible credit card use, hence why I have none now) and last I checked (a couple months ago) my credit was about 659, or just on the border between Fair and Good (according to Equifax)

Cell Phone: $115
Cable TV/Internet: $50
Electricity: $45
Food/Month: $300
Pet supplies/month: $70
Car Insurance: $170
**TOTAL: **$1884


**TOTAL MONTHLY INCOME** minus **TOTAL DEBT**: $2,116


I separated the areas that I wanted to talk about below.


---------------
**Investing money into my 403b**



I have a 403(b) account through my job and contribute 7% each pay period.


I recently received a raise and just barely jumped into a new tax bracket, which brings me to my first point of discussion:


Should I contribute more into my 403(b) so that I can lower my tax bracket again?


I am pretty confused by the way income tax is calculated at the federal and state level, which is part of the reason I decided to start a topic on this sub reddit.


I was thinking by contributing as much as i can, that i would reach the $18000 limit and fall into my previous tax bracket. My thoughts are that I should contribute as much to my 403b as I can possibly handle without hindering my day to day life too much. 


If my calculations are right, and they probably aren't, I would be saving a lot of money pre tax in my 403(b) to have that money working for me and also wouldn't take too much of a hit to my biweekly paycheck.


I currently make $95000 a year before tax (before my raise I was making $75k), which puts me into the $77k-~$250k bracket (can't remember the actual bracket limits).


If I contribute $18000 as soon as I could each year, I'd only take a $100 per week hit to my after tax income. As I mentioned, this is probably wrong, but that is why I'm asking people who might know.


After tax and 403b contributions, I currently make about $1000 per week. In the &lt;$77k tax bracket, I calculated that I would make $900 clean after contributions and tax. Again, I know this might not be right.


---------------
**Whether or not to invest in a Roth IRA**



Also, I was thinking of maxing out a Roth IRA through my bank each year. Ive read and been told it's good to diversify and I'm hoping that contributing to a pretax 403b and a post tax Roth is a good idea.  

Is it wise to max out a roth and 403b at the same time with my current income?  

---------------
**Investing in the stock market**


Ive been reading ""One Up on Wall street"" by Peter Lynch in an effort to educate myself on the basics of investing in stocks. I'm afraid to jump right in without at least knowing the lingo and the do's and donts of stocks.

Do you think I should be looking into stocks as well as a roth and 403b?
---------------


I understand that doing all of this is an aggressive approach to saving and investing, but I'm already 31 and have just started thinking about the big picture.

personalfinance,Updating Personal Finance Plan - Need a Gut Check,"Okay, I have been spending the last few weeks researching &amp; planning my personal finance goals.  I am in my early 30's and in a single-income household.  I am really getting a late start to being consistent in my savings but better late than never!

After going through the resources on this subreddit and other areas, here is the battle plan that I came up with.  Can you all please take a few moments to poke holes into it?  :)  

**Financial Savings Goals:**

1.  Setting up an emergency fund.  The initial goal is to get my emergency fund to 10K (already there) but I plan to grow it a little bit more over time. 

2.  My work has a fully funded pension plan, but does not do 401K matching.  My plan is to max out the RothIRA contributions.  Next, I will seek to maxing out my 401K.  I have rebalanced my budget to set aside 16.7% of my income.  I plan to start ""shaving"" bills until I get both of those buckets full.

3.  Regarding my mortgage, I do not plan to try to play it off early.  Right now, I am on a 5.49% fixed interest rate across a 25 year mortgage.  I am somewhere in year 7 of the loan.  I plan to try to refinance to see if I can snag a lower rate, but I want to get the budget thing wrapped up first.  As I understand it, my cash will probably be more wisely placed into mutual funds versus paying off a mortgage.  

4.  I have 2 children and I am making investments for them as well.  I fully realize that I should probably max retirement first, but these investments are small  (20/week).  My children are under 5, so that should add up to a nice sum by the time they are 18.  I do not plan to invest in a college specific fund like the 529 as I want this money to be usable for any reason (college, wedding, house downpayment, etc).  I am thinking to invest this $$ in a mutual fund of some sort. 

5.  Finally, if I meet all of those goals, I will plan to invest more.  I am a ways from this step, so I have not fully decided on my next course of action.  Probably, it will simply go into a mutual fund or I may try to do some other, riskier investment options.  

That's the plan.   Am I setting myself up to have a good foundation?  Thinking of each step, are there facts that I should consider or flaws in my logic?

On a side note, I am looking at setting up my RothIRA via Vanguard rather than hiring someone to manage it for me.  However, I get a little intimidated by the Mutual Fund choices.  I am still researching my options here, but I'd appreciate advice on this choice as well.

Thanks!",finance,1426814406
personalfinance,Massive Student Loans - Please Help,"I have $218k in law school loans. Before you tell me how dumb of an idea it was to take out so many loans, etc. etc., I never meant it to get THIS bad.  All in all I borrowed around $170k.  Upon graduation in 2009, a perfect storm of (1) the death of a parent, (2) a shit economy that led to a year of unemployment and two years of underemployment, and (3) loan consolidation which added the compound interest to the loan balance left me in way over my head.  When I signed up for law school in 2006, everyone I knew was getting $160k job right after graduation and I figured I could pay my loans down in 5-10 years.  Then the recession happened and everything went to shit.

For awhile I've been paying the minimum amount required for IBR every month (around $1000). My old plan was to wait it out for the 25 years and hope that some legislation would get passed that would help me out, but now I'm switching focus and want to actively pay it down. My boyfriend is worried that when we get married, this will affect our financial future for years to come.

So, /r/personalfinance, how do I do it?

Like I said, I'm on Income-Based Repayment and pay around $1,000/month. My salary, pre-tax, is around $110k.  The loan has a 7.25% interest rate, which is insane because the INTEREST ALONE is $1,500/mo.  For awhile, I was trying to pay upwards of $2,000/mo, but that's not feasible since I live in a very high COL area.

One idea I had was to refinance a chunk of the loan ($30k-ish) with SoFi and use Dave Ramsey's snowball method to aggressively pay that smaller amount down.  SoFi quoted me a 3.4% interest rate for this.

Another factor to consider is that I may be relocating to a low-COL area where the salaries are much, much lower, so I'm hesitant to lose the flexibility of the IBR.

Lastly - for some background - I have a 6+ month emergency fund in savings, roughly $22k in a 401(k), and no credit card debt or anything else. My expenses are as follows:

Rent: $1200
Utilities: $200
Phone/Cable/Internet: $200 (giving up cable is not an option)
Transportation: $200
Groceries: $200
Gym: $45

Total: $2045 in monthly expenses.  I get two paychecks a month and bring home around $5000 after taxes.

Any thoughts/suggestions are welcome. Please spare your opinions on how dumb my situation is because I already beat myself up enough over it.",finance,1426815099

personalfinance,What mortgage options do you like best?,"I am starting the house hunt for my first home with my soon to be wife (or fiancee). I read this article on zillow:
http://www.zillow.com/blog/cut-your-mortgage-payment-169021/

Of course the 80-10-10 option is shown as the lowest option, but I am sure this depends on a number of variables. From what I have read, I like the idea of the lender paying the insurance (granted the interest rate does not raise too significantly) and then the 80-10-10 option looks good too. My thinking on the insurance is; if it is $100/month, that is $36,000 extra I am paying. But I also wonder how that compares to the added cost of a seperate mortgage for the second half of my down payment.
I have excellent credit (775, thank you mom and dad for teaching me good practices!), am a first time home buyer, so I would like to think that I would be able to get the best interest rate available.

Not sure if this site is really conductive to this kind of thing, but here goes.  Seems I can't put images into the post, which hurts.  But I'm gonna try with the links and see how it goes over.

BRK.B looks pretty nice and healthy. Always good to see something consolidating calmly in the context of a steady uptrend, particularly if the rising 200 MA is coming to possibly act as support and give it a further nudge higher.

[$BRK.B daily chart analysis](http://i.imgur.com/DqnbHPv.png)

[$BRK.B Weekly chart analysis](http://i.imgur.com/cg5wusS.png)

BRK is basically a big fund.  Lots of different companies under one roof.  A decent proxy for the economy or broad market.  I’m a bit surprised to see it seemingly underperforming the SPX (S&amp;P500).  At least on this view.  

[$BRK.B/$SPX price comparison](http://i.imgur.com/3Yvw81E.png)

The following is a percentage comparison chart starting in the beginning of 2012 shortly after the market and BRK found a bottom and started a new rally.  I would say this points toward a possible consolidation period as it has outpaced the market pretty significantly over the last year.  
[$BRK.B/$SPX price comparison](http://i.imgur.com/3Yvw81E.png)

As always, and particularly with a big conglomerate like Berkshire, we have to look at everything in the context of what the market on whole is doing.  Taking just a big picture look using weekly candles and a 5 year chart, it’s clear the market has been in a pretty nice bull market for a long time now.  But the steady climb seems to be waning a bit.  It’s still in an uptrend with higher highs and higher lows, but just barely making those defining moments.  (Uptrend = higher highs and higher lows, downtrend = lower highs and lower lows.  This is an objective way to analyze trend on any time frame.)  Notice how over the last 4-5 months, it has been bouncing around in a fairly tight range, trying and sort squeezing higher, but mostly peeking it’s head higher and then barely following through if it all.  Not the biggest weekly volume spike from mid December when there was a big range and it tried to burst higher.  Peeked above, but didn’t make it.  Since then it’s been mostly grinding sideways.  Got a touch above that resistance level and then didn’t quite keep it.  Now testing that same resistance level.  
[$SPY weekly chart](http://i.imgur.com/vT1bg38.png)

Also noteworthy on that SPY chart is the “bearish divergence” seen between the equal or higher highs and lows in price, while the momentum indicators below are showing lower peaks.  That shows waning momentum under the hood.  

Nasdaq looks stronger on whole, but I would argue the momentum in the big picture is also waning.  
[$QQQ weekly chart](http://i.imgur.com/Qtt58Pp.png)

I always like to see the Russell 2000 trying to lead the big boys.  But it’s been such a wild card.  The last year was a big wide sideways range while the big indexes were marching higher.  And then it broke down below that range before rallying though it.  This latest surge since November or so just seems a bit imbalanced.  And we can see a bearish divergence between the surge in price and trickle off in volume on the IWM.  Of course, it’s not the true volume of the actual index, but this heavily traded ETF is a pretty good proxy, I’d say.

My take away, big picture?  If the crowd is buying, go with the flow.  But be nimble and proceed with caution.  Someday soon, I think, something will come to frighten the crowd.  Once they get truly spooked, it will then happen easier and perhaps more often.  If that happens, the resulting sideways range will then eventually break down.  That’s how tops are formed and broken.
Yesterday the market rallied big on the news of the FOMC shifting to perhaps a later date and less aggressive plan for raising rates.  (Or something like that.)  Big movement higher and big volume.  Today there was no follow through.  We’ll see if the coming days shine a better light on that reaction.",finance,1426828122

Bitcoin,We are starting to see an implosion of the world's financial system. And here's why.,"The doomsayers have been lamenting about financial doom for a long time, ever since the Financial Crisis in 2008. 

And now, the signs that the cracks are emerging are getting obvious. Let's examine the economies one by one.

The US is the world's biggest economy. Since 2008, its interest rates have been kept at a historical low level. On top of that, the Fed had completed 3 rounds of QE, resulting in a bloated balance sheet. The level of debt incurred by the government is unprecedented. The Fed knew that this cannot go on, and the first step to reverse this is to raise interest rate. But look at how the market react - the USD had rallied against major currencies for the last 3 months at between 5 - 10%. This is a net negative for the US economy because it makes export more expensive and import cheaper (thus encouraging deflation). The rate at which this rally takes place is staggering as well. I think the Fed does want to increase rate to ""normalise"" the economy but looking at how the USD rallies, it has no choice but to back off. This effectively means the Fed has little options right now at their disposal.

As a bloc, the EU is the second largest economy. Greece has been grabbing headlines lately. But I am not worried about news that appear everyday because the danger is known. We know that the EU economy is not doing well, we know that prices are nearing deflation, we know that the ECB had introduced massive QE and we know that the Euro, as the second largest currency had taken a hit against the USD. It is in even worse shape than the US now.

China is the third largest economy. Its economy is slowing and again, inflation is getting slower. The scary thing is that it is a big economy and yet, statistics and information is opaque. What we do know is that its real estates is in trouble right now, after the massive bubble. And along with it, the banks have been incurring increasing bad debt. On top of that, debts are huge at the local government level.

And then, looking at Japan, it has experienced stagnant growth for the last couple of decades. Recently, it introduced its own QE in an attempt to prop up the economy. The effect is yet to be seen but from the experience of past foreign QEs, the effect cannot be sustained (other than an artificial pumping of asset prices).

Despite all these, we see a dramatic rise in the price of real estates and stock market. How do we understand this? I attribute this to the pumping of QE money. But it is scary because QEs cannot be sustained. The US is no longer doing it, though the ECB and Japan had just started. I fear that the drop will be more than falling knife. And when that happens, guess what, QEs cannot happen anymore, and with interest rates already near 0, what else can central banks do?

The future is bleak and the easiest and safest asset to hold onto *was* gold. But since Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 and implemented in 2009, the better asset to hold onto is bitcoins. Why it is better than gold had been discussed several times and I shall not repeat. The downside is that its popularity cannot match against gold at this point. When this will change is anyone's guess.

tl;dr: Looking through the fog, anyone can see that our global financial system is cracking. Protect yourself financially while you can.

personalfinance,Advice on Student Debt,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I am in need of some advice about my debt. I was a part of a program that gave money for college in exchange for teaching in the state after graduation for four years. Unfortunately, student teaching led to disillusion about the education system for me, and I didn't have the heart to go through with it. This left me with $26,000 in debt at 10% interest, compounding annually.

I have been paying it off by a little more than the minimum repayment each month. The minimum is $448, and I usually pay $500. After almost two years, I have gotten the number down to about $20,000.

I am employed full time, and after taxes take home about $2,000/month. My boyfriend is employed part time and after taxes takes home about $900/month. The living expenses I pay are $400 for rent (includes water, internet), $100ish for electricity, $300 for groceries, $75 for gas, $10 for netflix, plus the $500 for my student debt repayment. Additionally, I put about $400 into savings each month. I have an emergency fund of $15,000. If my math is correct, my total monthly living expenses are $1,780, leaving me about $220 that I either leave in my checking account till the next month or spend on various unnecessary expenditures. 

As far as I have been able to research, my debt cannot be repackaged by another lendor with lower interest rates, so unfortunately that is not an option. I would like to pay this down more quickly, but I'm not sure how much more I need to put in it, as I like having that cushion of $220 in my budget. Should I put money into paying down my debt that I am currently putting into savings?",finance,1426844647

worldpolitics,The Spin Doctors on Sudan! Introducing Mr Reeves.,"Imagine, if what your were being told about the region of Sudan were really a smoke screen to achieve pre-set political goals devised by The US, The UK and Europe?

You already think that sounds far fetched?  Another conspiracy theory, because you already know that Sudan is a country where the leader is persecuting his people, and where the outside world keeps just trying to help, for no reason other than good conscience and the desire to see humanity, harmony and peace.

You know this, because that's what you've been told.  That's what you've been shown.  If you're on of the masses around the globe who simply choose not to look any further than what is presented to you, well then your governments are doing their job, achieving their goal and those chief doctors of spin will no doubt earn their reward.  

No I mean literally earn their rewards, as in payments, 'expenses' or as you and I might call it, a big fat 'bung' of cash to tell you the general masses how you should be perceiving the nations around the world, in this instance we are focusing on Sudan, but please, do not for a minute believe it stops or starts there. 

I know, this is deep and too much information is an overload, so let's keep it simple, let's give you just one of your chief spin doctors for now.  I give you Mr Eric Reeves. Who?  You know, the famed 'American Researcher,' high profile activist, purveyor of fine hotels (he particularly enjoyed compiling his report on Sudan in one).  Why...because he is an activist and cares about the plight of these poor people, so you think.

Imagine if some one told you actually it's not the case. It is the case Mr Eric Reeves is told what to tell you and is paid very handsomely to do just that, and oh he does such a very good job.  

Perhaps you ought to think to yourself is that truly possible?  Could Eric Reeves, champion of the people be receiving significant sums of money  via American and non-American companies to put a particular slant on the information he provides to the masses, which is given at just the right time to push through any particular political agenda's?

I mean it's not as if this has been done before right?  That's not how the world works, what is, is. I know the general population is not really that stupid.  Yes we're all busy and choose to accept things to enable us to focus on our own daily lives, but at least admit to yourselves, that we are all being led down the garden path here. What is, is, or what is,  actually isn't?

Or maybe, you're bright enough and wise enough to know deep within that it isn't, it's just that we all allow ourselves to be insulted every day with the false versions of reality we are spoon fed.  

Am I expecting you to believe people are not really suffering, in need of help and assistance.  Actually, no.  I'm just saying do not believe the version of events being presented to you.  Those of you with the means and ability, might be inclined to look further, to research and ask questions.  It has been very well concealed with a phenomenal propaganda machine and stealth financial management, but you know there are those that can and will get to the truth eventually.  Imagine if that were now, perhaps the people of Sudan would get the real help they need, the support and ability to build and develop their country under one leadership which already exists to unite them, to re-build their lives and stop being used as pawns in foreign political games.

For reference the after cost for TSP right now is .29 where most of the bigger mutual funds this sub and other's discuss have .17 - .20 and lowering significantly with investor's like Vanguard once you exceed 10k.

I might very well be missing something, and if so please explain what it is I'm not comprehending.

Obviously I get that any matching you get from a TSP is amazing and you should take advantage, but I'm talking from more of a view where you have a TSP because you were prior federal and you need to decide whether to keep that, or roll it into an IRA. Or even resign from a job with a 401k and decide whether to roll that into your TSP or a low cost index-fund based IRA.

personalfinance,Borrowing from your 401(k) for an investment,"My 401(k) plan offers me the option to take a loan against it. The way it works, if you take out a loan, they give you the cash, and deduct it from the balance in your 401(k) account. Then, each paycheck, they withhold money from your paycheck to pay off the loan. The amount they withhold includes an interest component, but you pay the interest to yourself - it goes into your 401(k) account. They charge a flat $50 fee to do this. However, if you get fired or quit before the loan has run its course, you have to pay the whole balance in 60 days - that's the only scary part. You also can't partially accelerate repayment - you either make the monthly payment they prescribe, or you repay the whole loan in full early, no partial repayments. The ""interest"" rate is the prime rate plus 1% (so, currently, 4.25%).

So here's what I'm thinking: what if I took out, say, a $10k loan, with a 5 year term, and invested it? Now I could invest that money in anything (not just the limited options in my 401(k)). The payments that would be deducted from my paycheck going forward are less than I save from my paychecks now, anyway - it's about $250 per paycheck ($500/month). It would just be like increasing my 401(k) contribution slightly.

I only see two downsides: first, I would now be investing in a taxable account, instead of a tax free account. That sucks, but the much better investment options open to me more than compensate I think. In my PA, I've beaten the market by quite a bit over the last 5 years. Downside 2 is that if I quit or left my job I'd have to come up with the money to pay the loan, but I have plenty of other savings to cover that - that wouldn't really be that much of a disaster. I guess also worth of mention is that I'd have to pay the $50 fee.

What should I watch out for?","I finished college in 2012 with roughly $120,000 in student loan debt. I'll be the first to admit it's pretty chaotic; I didn't have much guidance when taking them out and was stuck in the ""follow your passion"" mentality. I finally got a decent job related to my field this past January and am finally making *just* enough to break even after the minimum payments and my other expenses.

Although I'm absolutely pumped to finally be closing the gap between myself and financial independence, my current situation isn't leaving me any room to put anything into my 401K or an emergency fund. I've looked into consolidation but I know I shouldn't trust everything my bank tells me. I know they'd LOVE to have me on the hook for another 20 years paying higher interest. On the other hand, I can't sustain a lifestyle of just squeaking by.

Are there other options I should look into? Is consolidating even worth it?

personalfinance,How does the community feel about loaning money to yourself?,"The background on this is that, over the past five years or so, I've adhered to the personal finance credo and now sit very contently: 3 month safety fund, $0 debt, maxed tax-free retirement account, credit cards paid in full every month, budget-constrained, holiday fund established+healthy, and last year I nearly doubled my intended contribution to a taxed investment account. So things are going well, which is why I would even consider doing what I'm about to explain. 

A new expense has come up. It's one-time and it's fairly substantial but it's *not* an emergency. I've landed a new job that is very different from my old one. I'll be moving interstate, first of all, and will need to buy myself a set of suits, second. The full amount has been budgeted into the coming year, but the cost is all at the front end rather than accruing gradually over the year. In total,  we're talking about $2k here. 

So I propose to give myself a loan from the discretionary investment account. I usually let this account build up for about 4 or 5 months before investing it so that transaction costs are low. The idea would be to pay myself back at a rate somewhat lower than credit card interest rates - say 15%. 

I realise this is essentially the spending we all try and avoid, and the reasoning we all argue against in most circumstances. I guess I'm asking whether there is a point of discipline where you can rely on yourself to be your own bank.

I'm a 22 year old, single gal, living in California. I got my MS degree last year, which also involved taking out a $20K student loan. I was in the grace period until now. 

I'm currently working FT, but split (40/60) between two employers. In the 6-months grace period, I worked at the 40% employer for a couple months as well. As I recently just got hired to FT, I calculated my monthly gross income to be about $3400. 

I just watched a bunch of Khan Academy videos regarding taxes (minimal prior knowledge on this stuff), and frankly, I'm quite confused and also concerned for my personal finances. 

I have a buttload of questions and general topics that I would love some advice/resources on! 

* Firstly, is there a site that provides basic yet comprehensive information on everything related to personal finance (taxes, loans, retirement, etc)? 

* I understand that I'll be paying a large sum to for federal and state taxes, as well as the FICA stuff. Are there any tips I should know in order to minimize the amount I pay? Would it be a wise decision for me to withhold an amount from my paycheck? If so, how do I decide on this amount?

* How does my having 2 employers affect everything (allowances, deductions, taxes, etc)? Are there any specific things I should be aware of (ie. W-4 form)?

* Regarding my student loans, my plan is to repay as much as I comfortably can each month. But I also understand that the interest accrued can be deducted from my income taxes. Is there anything else in the loan department that I should be aware of? 

* Any advice on avoiding beginner/commonly made mistakes when it comes to income taxes?

personalfinance,Help figuring out Wife's Social Security problem,"Hello PF, long time lurker, first time poster. 

I am having a lot of trouble in regaurds to my wife's social security number. I am 20 and she is 19 (Yes, married young and we are fine). These are the problems that we have made the issue obvious.

1. When trying to get her health insurance online she was rejected as they could not verify her identity through her social security number. 
2. We are unable to file our state taxes through turbotax (federal went through as married filing jointly) because of a mismatch of her last name and social security number (tried it both with her last name and mine).
3. When she tried to start amazon turking, they rejected her as they could not verify her identity through her social security number.

We also have not recieved our marriage license after 5 months of being married. We do live in Chicago but they said we should recieve one in 4-6 weeks. I am not sure if this has to do with her Social or maybe just a mailing or filing error.

Today we went to the social security office to try and figure this out and they told us that everything was fine with her number. The woman said she will send out a new card which may help (but I doubt it).

After getting back from the social security office I tried to run a credit report to see if it had anything to do with that. I ran the Experian one and it said it was ""Unable to honor your request"".
She should not really have any credit history as she has only recently started working for cash but we have been renting a condo in both of our names so I feel like that should count for soemthing. The only thing we weren't really sure about was her previous address as she bounced around a lot between many members of her family because none of them really have their lives together. I feel like that info should not matter as much though.

Sorry for the long post but I really could use some guidance on what to do here. This is only turning into more of a headache. 

TL;DR : Wife's social security number gets rejected every time we try to use it, social security office said it was fine, can not pull credit report.",finance,1426888354

personalfinance,I was homeless for 2 1/2 years and now I'm filing taxes for the first time since 2012. I have also been attending college since January 2014. I could use some help trying to figure out what to do.,"January 2012 - I arrived in Los Angeles, homeless, with no money. With the aid of my mother, I filed my 2011 taxes and received ~$600 in return, which helped out for the first few months. I had received Food Stamps within a week, and General Relief (~$420/month combined) a month or so later. From that point on, until January of 2014, my sole income was the aforementioned government assistance **[FS/GR]**, with added Plasma donation funds between December 2012 and November 2013 (amounting to, I think, ~$100-140/month average).

January 2014 - I began receiving Federal Pell Grants in addition to my FS/GR. I was full time, initially but ended up finishing part time, and didn't receive the full semester's worth of aid (shy about $800, I believe). It's tough living in a tent and doing the school thing.

July 1, 2014 - I took a job in Alaska for ~7 weeks, earning ~$4,500. The company I worked for provided all transportation to/from Alaska. While I was there, I was able to avail myself (at no additional cost) of lodgings and the occasional prepared meal (the main reasons I decided to go, with the added income as a major bonus). I was receiving FS/GR as this time, but those were both canceled at the end of September 2014.

August 17, 2014 - I left Alaska and took a few days off in Seattle to just enjoy myself a little. I followed that up with a train ride from Seattle back to LA (not doing that again unless I get a sleeper) at my own expense.

August 21, 2014 - I arrived back in LA and took up residence in a an apartment with $300/month rent 2 days later, and have been here ever since. I've received Pell Grants for the Fall of 2014, and have received half of my Spring 2015 Pell Grant (totalling ~$6,700, including Spring 2014), but I know that money will be running out in roughly a year from now (that's less the point of this post, I guess). I have attended college full time since the beginning of the Fall semester.

My questions/concerns:

* Should I have prepared a tax return for 2012, despite my 2012 income only consisting of government assistance and 1 month of plasma donation payments? Similarly, for 2013, with ~11 months of plasma donation payments?  
* Should I go ahead and file for those years? Will it be worth the time/effort? Will I be penalized for not doing so?
* Is the plasma donation income required, and is there any way to get the total amounts received from the donation centers?  
* Do the Pell Grants need to be incorporated into filing my taxes? The same with FS/GR?  
* Should I just go somewhere and have all this taken care of for me, for a nominal fee?  
* I've paid ~$30 in Alaska Unemployment Insurance, is this an issue?

I'm sure there are other questions rattling around in my head, but I'm unable to fish them out. If you need me to clarify anything, or have further questions, please feel free to ask.

personalfinance,How can I use my home to pay down 102K of student loans?,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

I have 102K of student loans (specifics posted below) that have just come due. I have applied for PAYE/IBR but it hasn't come through yet, so while I'm waiting I'm thinking about alternatives. Student loan payment without PAYE/IBR is $1,190 a month, all loans are federal. 

I own a home that I purchased for $79,000 at 4.375% interest and no PMI and currently owe $59,868. I don't have much equity, but I'm wondering what my options are in regards to refinancing, HELOC, 2nd mortgage, etc. that might give me a large enough lump sum to pay off some or all of my student loan debt. The last property value statement said the home was valued at $125,000, but that isn't taking into account a full home remodel (I have not had it re-appraised). I would prefer not to sell as my mortgage payment is $450 including tax and insurance and it would be tough to find something in that range in Phoenix. I'm two years into a 30 year mortgage. Other homes on my block are currently listed and selling for between $200-250k after a full remodel, if that matters. 

My spouse and I bring in about $70,000 - 80,000. He has about $12,000 of student loan debt, but he's considering going back to school whereas I am done with school. I am employed in the STEM field, and just currently working on certifications/experience to increase my earnings. We have no credit card debt and owe about $5,000 on one vehicle. Public Service Loan Forgiveness is not really an option for me, at least in the foreseeable future. We are currently putting money away for retirement, working on increasing our currently meager emergency fund, and we have one completely paid off vehicle. 

Can anyone shed some light on some options that I might have to use my home to pay off my student loans? I am very new to this whole mortgage/real estate thing and I'm not familiar with things like equity, refinancing, etc. I am hesitant to contact my mortgage broker without having some knowledge on my side as I don't want to sign up for anything that isn't a good option.

personalfinance,Paid off a major credit card debt and now I need to know where to go with the money I have left over.,"Hi everyone!

I've been reading all the information in the side bar and lots of posts over the past few weeks.

I have about $45,000+ in debt. Several student loans and one car loan. Most of the student loans are currently in deferment and are not collecting interest at this time. I will be paying for my final year of grad school out-of-pocket thanks to the credit card debt being wiped out a couple of weeks ago and my income going up.

I have $20,000 in a mutual funds account, a cash value life insurance plan, some other retirement savings account that I started and then quit contributing to (but I'm going to start, again!), and $2,000 in my emergency savings (1 month cost of necessities).

That state is going to give me a final $3,000 installment toward one of my student loans this summer - I don't know which one but probably the only one that isn't currently in deferment.

This is where I need help!

How much should I take out of the mutual funds account to pay off debt?

Do I pay off the highest-interest debt (ranging from 6.21% to 7.9% student loans) that *is not* collecting interest at this time because it is deferred until December 2016 (6 months after I graduate my masters program)?

Do I pay off the debt that is currently collecting interest first (a car loan, balance of $8,000 and interest rate of 4.5% OR a student loan that isn't deferred, balance of around $5,000 interest rate of 2.5%)?

Do I move the $20,000 out of a mutual funds account (where it was being saved by my parents since I was a child - this was the original amount I had for the downpayment of my home and it's all I have left now)?

I currently earn $4,100 a month conservatively. My monthly expenses come out around $2,000 including ""regular luxuries"" (beauty appointments or beauty products - things that are part of my routine and I wouldn't choose to give up if I didn't have to). I'm not contributing to my 457 plan, yet, but I'm getting set up to do that next week thanks to all the advice I read on here. I don't know how much I will end up contributing to the plan, yet. I'm guessing around $400 based on 6% of my approximate gross salary. Is that a good guess??

A final detail - I want to move out of my apartment soon and for the places I am looking at my rent will go up from $760 to $1,100 (I won't go into detail but it involves a stalker, so I consider it a worthy expense) and I'm willing to wait a little while if it's more financially responsible to do so (I'm kind of safe here for now, but I really don't want to test it past October when my restraining order expires).

Thanks. If no one even responds to this I've learned SO MUCH useful information in this sub. I just really want to say THANKS!

EDIT: I'm seeing that some student loans are collecting interest (just checking it now. I'm not the smartest with my money...) so I'm guessing I should pay those off before the car loan even though I wouldn't be delinquent if I didn't pay them back all the way until Dec. 2016?",finance,1426900887

Little background:
Dad - went back to college at 45 yr. Now works part time (20 hrs and not 40 like he wants) because his company are assholes to him cause he's new to the profession and much older than all the new hires. 
Mom - elementary school teacher.

$19,000 - student loans
$12,000 - CC#1
$1,000 - CC#2
$1,000 - CC#3
$1,000 - CC#4

Expenses:
No information given. They have no idea. Both cars paid off at least, I know that. 

So basically with all this unknown information, obviously I'm going to ask for it. They don't even know the interest rates on their debts. Totally in the dark. I want to help them, but I need to look after myself first with my new job out of college (hope I'm not being selfish). 

I do know that my mom has a teachers pension with the state of Texas. I assume everyone gets social security when theyre older?? Also my dad has a 401k, no match so he doesn't contribute. Mom has 403b option but doesn't contribute. They're so tried in debt that they've never given retirement a chance.

My monthly expenses:

* $1350 fixed bills (mortgage, cable/utilities, phone, etc)
* $450 student loan payment
* $1000 everyday expenses (groceries, gas, household items)

My expenses are a little high, but I am supporting my girlfriend who is a full time student.  We've been together 7 years, and plan to be together for the foreseeable future.

This leaves me with about $900 extra per month.  I've been putting about half into savings and paying half towards my highest interest student loan.  (I had been paying the minimums on SL's for 2 years, then I looked up the payoff date, and I would be almost 50!  I've set a goal to pay them all off within 5 years, or sooner.)

My girlfriend currently makes about $600/mo which covers her day to day expenses, plus she gives me money when she has extra.  I used to just blow it on stuff, now I just put it straight to my student loans.  She will graduate in about a year, with roughly $10k in subsidized student loans.  Assuming she finds a job after graduating, I'm guessing she'll start at roughly $40k-50k per year.

--

My current plan:

My #1 priority is to pay off my student loans, starting with the highest interest rate first.

My #2 priority is to build a 6 months emergency fund.  I have pretty stable employment, so I'm content building this over time so I can pay student loans more aggressively.

My #3 priority is to encourage my girlfriend to graduate and find a good job.  We are content with our current house/cars/lifestyle so her income will help to pay down student loans VERY aggressively.  Once the student loans are paid off, we want to start paying down the mortgage, or putting money aside in investments.

My #4 priority is to continue to educate ourselves about money/PF/FIRE.  About a year ago, we were living paycheck to paycheck.  We have made significant strides in the past year, but know we have a lot of room to go.

I'm not setting any goals at this point for when I (we) would like to not have to work.  I enjoy my job, but would like the freedom to say, ""Eh, I'm gonna take a month off to go travel.""  I come from a loving family who was terrible with money.  As a kid, when the internet crapped out, I was never sure whether it was the router or if dad couldn't pay the bill again. (I know, first world problems)  My parents have no retirement, but are determined they will always ""find a way.""  I love them, but I don't want the stress of that lifestyle.  I am very happy and proud to have graduated college, got a job, bought a house I love, found a girl I love, and to be able to give her the opportunity to pursue an education.

When I think of the future, I see myself grinding it out at work for the next 5-10-ish years.  I like my job, and I get great experience, and I don't ever dread having to go to work.  But, I'd eventually like to switch to part-time, take time off to travel, or start my own thing.  But at the same time, I know that won't come without more planning, effort, and education.

I guess I'm just looking for any tips, advice, critique, words of wisdom, or words of encouragement as I start this journey.  Thanks and good luck to everyone!",finance,1426905138

I'm not sure how I'll get the loans over the federal max because I'll be 17 for the first month or so. I *might* be able to graduate in 3 years, but I'm estimating 4 to be on the safe side.

The estimated starting salary for the career I want to get into is $50,000. My top choice will give me much better chances of this, though I believe that I still have pretty good chances with my second choice too. I like my top choice more, obviously that's why it's my top choice. But I believe at my second choice the fact that I'll be ""higher up"" will put me in more leadership positions and such which will sorta balance things out. The thing is nobody can predict if the economy will be in the crapper again when I graduate or if I'll be forced to take a part time/way lower paying job.

I like to believe that I'm pretty good with money. I actually made a budget for my parents. When we were filling out the FAFSA my parents were like ""well if the government thinks we're so rich why are we always so broke"" and I pointed out some ways where they might be spending more than they realize (eating out 3x/week at about $150/week) so I made a spreadsheet of their debts, bills, etc and made a budget. Anyways, IDK what to do! Please give me a bit of input to help make my decision easier :)

**TL;DR:** My top choice will put me $26,000 in debt, my second choice $4,000. Est. starting salary $50,000. In my first year, I'd need to take out over the federal limit for loans so would need an outside source, but I'm 17 and don't know where I could get that or if it's possible.",finance,1426917268

personalfinance,"32,000$ in debt, dropping degree before I can complete it, and only qualified for min. wage job...","Some background: Got my general A.A. at state college. Got a scholarship (9000$/semester) to go to a private artschool (art center college of design) that cost about 18k a semester before scholarship. I attended for 3 semesters, and have accrued 32k in debt (interest wracking up). I calculated that to graduate I'll be about 80k+ in debt and I've realized it's just not worth it for an art degree when the kind of material can be self-taught and art schools are ridiculously overpriced. The art degree is absolutely worthless and all that matters is portfolio in the art world.

I have three types of loans but can consolidate one (the federal loans) if needed.

 My parent plus loan is at 19,000$ of that 32k chunk, with 1.7k interest added ontop of that already over two years.  It has an interest rate of 6.41%.

My other set of loans are unsub/subd federal loans. Altogether these are about 10,750$ with about 190$ in interest accrued. They have very small interest rates compared to the parent plus loan.

The good thing is my mom is letting me live with her indefinitely, at no cost to rent and she's willing to cover insurance on my car/health insurance because she's an angel. She will let me share her groceries. 0$ for living expenses!!!!!!!!!!!

The bad news is I only qualify for minimum wage jobs since I've only ever worked minimum wage, and don't have anything but a general A.A. I talked to professionals working in the entertainment industry and art directors and I've been told I'm about a year or two off from being able to be good enough to get a full-time professional position doing visual development or concept art but only if I put in a stupid amount of hours, they told me a minimum of 8-16 hours a day of training and that I'm more intermediate advanced right now.

My question is, should I move back in with my mom and get a part-time min. wage job while studying or stay in school/do something else (I REALLY don't want to do anything else though)? I figured it wouldn't be a good idea to get a full time job, because I need to put that education I got to use and put in those ridiculous hours self-studying for a better payout in the end since those entertainment design jobs do pay well. 

Would minimum wage in FL (where my mom lives) be enough to sustain the loan payments when I don't have to worry about other costs? It's 8.05$/hr there. Parent Plus Loans aren't eligable for IBR so I can't smack those down like I can with the smaller federal loans. Would I be able to put enough of a dent in it to survive month to month on minimum wage? Is my course of action (my plan) worth going through with -- move back with mom, minimum wage to fend off loan payments, and self-study in all the down time?

Thank you for any input, I value all of it!

edit: I'd also like to add because I got in a car accident last year and it wasn't my fault, I got a settlement of 2000$. I have about 800$~~when I move out to my moms THEN the check for the settlement will come a little after so I'll be sitting on about ~2800$ to start with. Should I just dump most of that toward the parent plus loan immediately?",finance,1426938181
personalfinance,Use excess cash to pay off student loans or put cash in low cost index funds?,"Hey guys,

Looking for some feedback from people who may have a different viewpoint/expertise than me.  I have $32k in student loans.  The loan term is 19 years and interest rate is 5.875%.

personalfinance,Receiving a small inheritance. Need some tax help,"Hello /r/personalfinance, 

My grandmother recently passed away, and I am one of the beneficiaries of her 403(b) account. 

Inheritance may have been the wrong word to use, but I'm not exactly sure what this would be. In order to receive the funds, I have to fill out a form and claim them, at which point they are withdrawn from the account at their current market value and distributed to me. ~~(My only other option is to roll directly into an inherited IRA, which doesn't sound appealing).~~ **EDIT: I was incorrect in my assumption here. I actually have a new question now.** 

Given my financial situation, should I roll this $10k into an inherited IRA account to continue it's tax-deferred status? OR, should I withdraw the cash now, and put it towards my emergency fund/etc.? Here is my current financial situation and plan:

* Age 23, full time job, $45k income, stable
* Contributing 6% of my pay to a Roth 401k, which is the maximum match from my employer (100% on 3%, 50% on next 3%)
* Still working on my emergency fund. Currently have $2k, goal is $5k, which is a little over 3 months of expenses including my minimum debt payments. By continuing normal contributions, I'd be able to reach the goal balance in early/mid-July. 
* After the emergency fund is set, I plan to throw any excess at my debt, in this order (I may just make minimum pmts on the last one or two, since the rates are so low):

Loan | Rate | Current bal
---|---|----
Student | 6.55% | $4k
Car | 5.69% | $10k
Student | 5.35% | $3k
Student | 4.25% | $3.5k
Student | 3.15% | $10k

* After those are set, possibly except for the last one or two, I plan on opening a traditional IRA. 

**What is the smartest plan of action, given my situation?**

**Below is the rest of my original post:**

Any distribution I receive would be considered income, and I would be liable for federal and state taxes. They are required to withhold 20% towards federal taxes, but they do not have any requirement to withhold state taxes (New York). 

Should I elect to have no NY state taxes withheld? My thinking is that if I receive the money now, and generate some return on it while planning for my tax liability next year, I'll be better off than just paying the tax up front. The distribution would be about $10k.

I've already got my taxes planned pretty thoroughly, so I'm not worried about not having enough set aside next year. My only concern is if there's any kind of penalty for doing this. Is this a good idea?",finance,1426941335

personalfinance,How to best attack my loan situation [student],"Hello all,

I have followed a lot of advice I have seen here and have been relatively smart about attacking the loans I have acquired over time. I am in a situation now where I can work overtime to get ahead and I am wondering what the best repayment method would be.

First, some background information. I make approximately $3k/mo and now have about $1.5k/mo in loans. I contribute to a Roth 401k a percentage of my pay, have an HSA to contribute to, just paid off my car and I have an ""emergency"" fund for 3-6 months in the case that something happens. I currently live with my wife and her mother in a great, supportive household, pay no rent and I have a budget in place that I've been sticking to.

This is a far cry from the dismal situation I was in when repayment came two years ago, but through some work I was able to pay off most to all of my high interest credit accumulated during college and just recently my car. So now I have some loose money and want to start aggressively tackling my student loans. They are as follows:

* ~$82,000 @ 7.66%
* ~$39,000 @ 7.75%
* ~$23,000 @ 5.88%
* ~$22,000 @ 3.00%
* ~$10,000 @ 5.88%

I know the typical advice is to ""attack the higher interest rate"" which I have done prior to this with consolidation to where I am currently.

Long winded explanation aside, the question is which should I start attacking? Should I go after the higher value, higher percentage loans or knock out the smaller ones to reduce my monthly minimum payments? Right now I think the target is the $40k loan because that seems surmountable in a year and also would relieve more per month than the other, smaller ones.

The reason I am afraid to attack the higher value ones is if I don't make significant enough progress, I am still left with a higher minimum monthly on the other loans.

Can anyone provide some insight into which approach would be best?

Thanks,

personalfinance,[housing] What would you buy? Tiny house in cash or dream house with a 10 year mortgage. (MEX),"I am a non-native english speaker and this is my first real post, please be kind :)

I'm in the market of a new home for me and my dog. Job security is good and pay is great. I'm 34 and single but with wedding plans in 1-2 years and kids in 3-4 years from now. I have been saving for most of my life and have a few options but need your expert advise. Girlfriend is also a dog lover so having space for a dog is a must. Mortgage interest rates are low and market is great with many house offerings.

1. **Tiny house in cash**. No garden for a dog, 2 bedrooms, 1500sqft/140m2. I will spend everything in one place, even my emergency fund. I can live with that as long as I save aggressively for one year to have some money in the bank for future plans. Once we get married and family starts to grow I can always sell/rent this one and move to a bigger house. Girlfirend agrees to cover most of wedding expenses. I love her :)

2. **Small house mostly in cash**. Tiny garden for a dog, 3 bedrooms, 2000sqft/185m2. Again, spend everything I have plus a small mortgage that can easily go away in 5 years or 2 if I save aggressively. It would require 10-20% of my salary just for mortgage. Just like the previous house, we would have to move to a bigger house once family grows.

3. **Dream house with a 10 year mortgage**. Big garden, 4 bedroom, nice neighbourhood, 4000sqft/370m2. Spend everything and tie myself to a 10 year mortgage. I will spend 30-40% of my salary just to cover it. No extra money for improvements or repairs or anything for years. If I play it smart I can pay it off in 7 years or 4 if we both chip in. Again, wedding expenses can be covered by her. We can live there for decades.

2) employer 403(b) w Fidelity: already contribute to the max for match (75% up to 6%).

3) she is enrolled in a masters program while working full time so loans are currently in deferment.  She makes the interest payments every year avoid capitalization.

4) roth IRA: contribute max already

5) employer 403(b) w Fidelity: already contribute another $5220. USE $9,300 to max out to $18000 for this year (obv will be earned income offset)

6) house downpayment: it seems crazy but since i'm going to need the money in about 2.5 years, i'm planning on stashing about 50K this year and another 50K next year in preparation purchasing a house and being able to make a 20% down payment on an up-to $500K house. So immediately, USE 50K into short term savings (1 yr CD).

7) taxable brokerage: USE rest here.  Because I need another 50K in 1 year to ready a down payment, I'll be putting that into a low cost bond ETF (BND).

I’m graduating soon but I intend to work in Hong Kong, which means my future income would be in HKD. Since HKD is pegged to USD at 1 USD = 7.8 HKD, **consider as if I am working in the United States and earning USD**. 


I might be able to get a loan in HKD or USD to repay the CAD loan in full **by November**, but I am worried that crude oil may rebound in the coming months, causing USD/CAD to go below 1.2422 (CAD/USD go above 0.8050), and CAD appreciating means my liability denominated in USD is increasing. 


Ideally, I want to long CAD/USD Call Option, but that’s not possible because the contract size is CAD 100,000. I only want to hedge CAD 30,000. On the other hand, the contract size for E-micro CAD/USD *Futures* is CAD 10,000.   
&amp;nbsp;  

What trades can I make to mimic the payoff of longing CAD/USD Call Option?


If that is impossible, what can I do to *partially* hedge against rising Canadian Dollars?


What about ETFs like TSE:HOU, or Options on ETFs like TSE:XEG? What about Canada Bond Futures?

personalfinance,Using Principal Contributions from Roth IRA for First Time Home Purchhase,"26 years old, looking towards making my first home purchase, and trying to decide if I should utilize up to 10k of my Roth IRA contributions towards my down payment. I also have a 401k and pension with my company that I will be vested in at the time of purchase, so I would not be cleaning out my retirement contributions with the route of using Roth IRA funds. Appreciate the feedback. Here is my info:

-70k income

-0 debt outside of monthly credit card purchases that get paid in full each month

-House Value ~250k

-HOA dues ~250/month

-Property Tax Assumption- 2%

-Money available for down payment outside of 5k emergency fund: ~20k

-Would qualify for 5k down payment assistance, if I stay 10 years, then I wouldn't have to pay back, otherwise a proportionate amount of the 5k would be due at the time of future sale. This down payment assistance is applicable to FHA and Conventional mortgages

I ran some mortgage calculations with some different down payment variables, a 4% interest rate, taxes, PMI, and the 250/month HOA:

With 25k down payment (20 + 5 assistance): $1918
With 35k down payment (20 + 5 assistance + 10 Roth IRA contributions): $1865

Both these payments will keep my DTI below 36%, which I am comfortable with, but at a $50/month price difference, I am wondering whether I am better off using my 10k in Roth IRA contributions to do the leg work for me by staying in the account.",finance,1426980985
personalfinance,Student Loan Advice,"Hi all,

I finished grad school about a year and half ago, got a job a six months later, and have been working on paying back student loans from undergraduate (there were none from grad school).  The total roughly around $55k, and have varying interest rates from 2% to 6.8%. However, during the six months inbetween, I was short on cash and had trouble making payments, and received a severe delinquency on my credit score. I've recently looked at refinancing my loans, but was rejected because of this. 

My question is this: what is the best option to handle my current financial situation? Should I continue trying to refinance or consolidate? Or should I focus on paying off the highest interest loans?",finance,1426982614
personalfinance,Looking for advice on financial plan for the next year,"I'm currently trying to decide the best plan of action for my current situation as well as two possible scenarios next year. I'm engaged to be married next year and looking to put myself in the best financial situation possible. Here's my current situation:

* $15,000 in savings
* putting away an additional $850-$1,000 a month
* Student loan payment at $275 a month towards a total of $20,000. Here's the breakdown on each individual loan:
     $1,444.91 @ 5.75% interest
     $1,036.83 @ 6.55% 
     $950.83 @  4.25% 
     $5,060.10 @ 6.55%
     $2,004.31 @ 6.55%
     $2,877.15 @ 5.35%
     $6,695.58 @ 6.55%
* My mom also has a parent plus loan that she is taking care of for now. At some point in the future I will take over payments, but for now it's a non-issue (side question: do these loans have any bearing on my credit when it comes to applying for a mortgage?)

Ideally I'd like to pay everything I can minus a $5k emergency fund and aggressively pay them off from here on out. Next year after marriage I'll be returning to school, either med school or a graduate program, which makes figuring out what to do now a little trickier. My fiancée will be graduating from school next month and will start a job making about $40k a year, with about $30k in student loans at what I assume are similar interest rates to mine. Here are our two scenarios:

* I attend a graduate program that will cost $75k over two years while I continue to work full time. In this scenario, we would like to purchase a home to move into next spring. Is it responsible to continue to line our savings accounts to have at least $30k for a downpayment on a home while paying the minimum, or are we better off eliminating our student loans and having a smaller downpayment/going for an apartment for a year or so?

* The other scenario involves med school, which at that point we would not go for a house next year at all. Instead we would settle for an apartment since there are no schools near us. Are we better off just saving everything we can here too with minimum payments to have a nest egg for 4 years and then fighting our way out of another $150,000 in student loans?

personalfinance,Mid 20s. Student loans. Little income. Owe lots of money for 2014 taxes. Deets inside.,"Hey, [r/personalfinance] (http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance),

I've seen similar posts, checked the sidebar and have done other research, but I wanted to reach out to regardless to get advice, hear similar stories, words of wisdom, etc...  

My TL;DR for this is: didn't understand a 1099, am poor mid-20s, owe much $$$ for taxes, WTF to do?  

**Backstory:**  

Graduate college December, 2012. Get a job the following August, 2013. Technically work full time 9-5 M-F, but am a contract employee for 20 hours a week between two companies in one space as a shared employee. Work this job from September 2013 to November 2014.

**Present day:**  

A family member is doing my taxes for me and just broke the news that I unfortunately owe about $6K+ to the feds. Needless to say, my jaw hit the floor. Not gonna lie, I started to tear up because, well, that's a pretty overwhelming thing to learn (especially when you are sick). I asked her to explain to me how this could be, and she said that I received 1099s instead of W2s because I was technically a contract employee and that because this indicates self employment, owing taxes is on that person's shoulders instead of on the business.  

In all the jobs I've ever had (and they've all been part time because I was in school for 5 years and the aforementioned job was my first ""big kid"" job out of school), I have always gotten a W2 and subsequently, a return of some sort. I can sit here and bemoan the fact that I didn't do my homework this time around, yada yada, and yes I didn't really think I'd be affected any differently come tax time by being a contract employee because I didn't think to think it, but this reality is shoving its ugly butt in my face and I feel paralyzed. As a side note, I also feel really angry towards my employers, as the job itself always felt as if it were more an advantageous setup for them and not for me (my income always fluxed, I didn't have any insurance or PTO, etc...) and stressed me out in several ways during my time there. I guess I wished that someone -- my employers, my own sense of logic, a parent, a wizard -- had forewarned me that I'd have to scrimp throughout the year in order to account for tax season given my employment situation. To expect a relatively similar tax season as others in the past and then be faced with this situation is unsettling. Lesson learned, amirite?   

As it stands now, I make decent money serving and I also hold a couple odd jobs to keep money coming in. I can support myself, pay bills/rent, and live somewhat comfortably but I don't have extra money just falling out of my ass to swiftly sweep a 6K debt out of my way by 4/15. I have a hefty sum of student loans as well, and I just don't know what to do in this situation. I guess I'm just looking for advice, support, perhaps comfort, etc... I know there are payment plans and options, and I plan on calling the IRS once I get my forms back from the family member.  

Anyway, thanks for listening.

**Edit:** not sure if this is relevant, but the figures for 2014 are as follows (rounded):  

Total income: $32.5K  
Adjusted gross income: $27.8K  
Taxable income: $17.6K

personalfinance,"29yo - I make 140k, fiance makes 50k. Seeking advice on balancing debt/savings/assets.","Hello,

I'm looking for some advice on how to manage the next few years financially. 


A little about me:


I'm a 29 year old software engineer.  I make 140k, and my fiance makes 50k. I'm probably close to capping out on day-job salary, and her too. I may strike it lucky with one of my side-ideas, or stock options, but, chances are, income isn't going to rise too quickly any time soon.


I bought a condo in DC in 2007 (worst time ever) for 280k. The house is finally out from being underwater (I owe 205k, it's worth 240k). It's been rented for a few years, and it's definitely a net negative cash flow (around $-300, but I am building about $200/mo in equity). I also live on the other side of the country now. This year, I discovered that there are limits, based on your AGI, to how much you can write off as a loss. I could only deduct 6k for 2014, despite having much greater depreciation+losses. In previous years, I've deducted 15k+.


I own another home that I live in, in Seattle. I bought in 2013, 340k, probably worth the same or a little more now. I could rent it and break even, cash-flow wise.


My fiance has 100k in student loan debt, under her parent's names. We have to pay those loans. The interest rate is pretty high on them. We have no other meaningful debt.


Here is my (current) plan:

Pay off the student loans ASAP. I don't want 100k in loans whilst trying to start a family. We are planning on pinching pennies and devoting 4k/mo to paying off those loans. They are relatively high interest, and the only option is for us to pay them. It should take less than 2 years. After that, I'd like to investigate buying another property and converting my current one into rental income. This plan would mean that, until we pay off those loans, my only additional savings would be IRA savings, and I'd have 10k in savings in case of emergencies. This is wildly different from my current savings, which is max IRA contributions + 2k/mo.

Here are a few questions:

1) Does my plan make sense? I think it's safe to slow my normal savings plan down and penny pinch to get through those loans, especially since we don't *have* to pay 4k/mo in an emergency situation. Would you do something differently?

2) Should I sell my home that's giving me a negative cash flow? With realtor fees, and capital gains due to all that depreciation, I'm assuming I will walk away with $0 from selling it. The market is still recovering, but it is very slow. If I did manage to make some money, it could go towards another property in Seattle, or towards those loans.

3) Any special tax advice for lowering my AGI? The tax advantages of a rental home are very slim for me right now. In previous years, I've been able to write off 15k+. With my current AGI, I can't write off that much.

4) I have an appetite for doing more real estate investing (rental properties), but seeing my limits on tax deductions is making me reconsider that. I am in this in-between situation, where I can't make a down payment large enough to get a positive cashflow, and I can't write off that much tax-wise from a smaller-down-payment negative cashflow property. Is there any way around this problem?

I really appreciate any advice!! Thanks redditors!

edits: I should mention that I pay PMI on the DC/cash-flow-negative property. Once I'm through that, I should be cash flow positive, or close to cash flow positive. I also have a management company managing it. It is a huge load off my mind, and, so far, seemingly very worth it, given I live across the country. They take 1 month for a finder's fee, and 8%/mo for management.",finance,1426990479
personalfinance,Financial Advice,"Hello Reddit, We've been very fortunate and found ourselves in a unique (to us) financial situation. I've been doing some heavy internet research but quite honestly don't have much understanding of financial service products to strategically compare them. 

Basically we’re looking for the best way to store some money. We have in the neighborhood of 250K coming to us this summer, which is currently in escrow. We've casually discussed it with a CPA, plugged this figure into Turbotax to figure out what we'd be paying in taxes. The money is considered short term capital gains, and with our current income tax bracket it puts it about 24% (Federal, State and city) we’re being safe and assuming it as high as 30%.  We plan to use the bulk of this money as a down payment for a purchase of a coop apartment here in the city, our first home purchase for the both of us.  The typical sale of coop is 60-90 days, so according to our loan officer we’d need the money accessible in 4-5 weeks. We’ve given ourselves up to a year in our current rental apartment, but are doing our best to make the move as soon as possible. So basically less than one year we’d need to store the money. My initial plan was to deposit the money between 3 savings accounts; take the money for the down payment as needed w/in the next year and pay the taxes next April 15th.  Thoughts?  Are there any significant fees when electrically transferring this amount of money? Am I missing something huge? Thanks! 

Some background: My wife and I are in our late 30's, we live in NYC, have two young children in public school. We are both solidly employed, Masters in our respective fields. We live in an area where it is cost prohibitive to drive, both have low interest student load debt, but other than that have no other debt. It took a struggle to wipe out our high interest debt, but with that gone we will increase our “safety” savings. Short term, also we’d increase the 529 contributions. Longer term we hope to ramp up our IRA contributions (neither of us have employer matching) as soon as the home buying costs settle. I expect it to be w/in the first 6-12 months. Our goal would be live w/in our means and still invest 10-12% of our current net income. 

We currently have a small saving that would cover our living expenses for about 2/3 months. Significantly longer if one of us remained employed. We’re also anticipating this saving covering our moving expenses. We are both in good health; locked in a good life insurance policy (for 12 more years) for each of us.  We also have disability coverage thru our work, but w/out thorough investigation it seems pretty unreliable. Thanks!

I just graduated college and got a fantastic job but I have no experience so they pay me very little.

Im 26 and have never been in debt. I have never needed to buy anything on credit. I was in the Navy from 18 - 23. I didnt want to try and build credit then because I didnt always have a way to pay the bills.

So I saved my money and when I got out I paid for a used truck with cash.

I want to buy a house in the 125000 dollar range.

Ive got a 30 - 35 % down payment saved up. I want to have at least $10000 left after a down payment. Otherwise I'd have a larger down payment.

My problem is I have no credit. Which means I won't be able to get a mortgage. I make enough money where I could easily afford mortgage and Im working on getting more and more saved for a down payment.

How can I quickly get good credit? To me it all seems like a scam. Buying things on credit when you have the money just to get some score associated with you.. why cant they just look at what you make and decide if you can afford a mortgage.. im sure it helps to see youre reliable though if you have good credit. 

But my concern is that it will take a long time to build good credit.. I assume they make it take a while because thats more interest lending companies make..

What are good ways to accumulate good credit quickly? Whay is a good credit card for someone my age?

What should I know about credit cards? Do cards with annual fees tend to have lower interest rates? What cards have the lowest rates?

How do you manage your $. I've recently started using quicken which take some dedication but so far I've found out to be the most helpful. I've used everything imaginable in the past and have either fallen behind, not worked with the way I budget, etc. I've been updating quicken every weekend and so far I like it. 

Currently we're doing a lot of furnishing and upgrades to the house that we've been holding off until I got my salary increase, so thats where a lot of our outside expenses have been going. These will probably continue for the next 3-5 months until we've finished the rooms we have been wanting to. 

I've always been into my cars so that expense wont change.

personalfinance,Would it be unwise to open a credit card specifically for a plane ticket (but also for other expenditures)?,"Apologies in advance for the length-

In July, I will be moving to California with my SO. His parents are taking him out there for a week in May after graduation (and Vegas because the place we're moving to is incredibly boring so they'll only be apartment hunting for a day or so). They have invited me to come along. Pretty much the only big thing I am being asked to pay for is the plane ticket (plus any shopping, gambling, or miscellaneous...they are paying for hotel, food, etc.).

Unfortunately, I'm a relatively poor college kid. I have about $700 saved up so far for the move out there (yes I know I need more, but his company is paying for all of the move except for my gas/hotels on the way out there and a majority of our start-up living expenses will be covered in other ways). So what I have saved now should easily cover what I need, but I plan on having about 1500 by the time I leave just to be safe).


The plane ticket for the trip in May will be about $360ish. **My big question is, should I use the money I already have saved, or would it be worth it to open a credit card to pay it off over the next few months?**

Some info:

- My only current expenses are groceries (80ish/month), entertainment/going out (30ish/month), gas (40ish/month) and utility bills (70ish/month)
- I have already paid all my other bills (rent, car payment, phone bill, car insurance, etc.) through August
- I have an auto loan through a credit union that is $148/month (as previously mentioned, it is currently paid for through August). After the payments through August have officially been made (they're currently in a separate account that does automatic withdrawal every month), I'll have 20 months and about $3100 left, although I would like to have it paid off in closer to 12 months or less just to get it out of the way. No late payments have been made on it.
- I have 7 federal student loans right now dating back to June 2013 , totaling approximately $22,000. My hope is to haul ass and pay it off within 2 years (unless that's a stupid idea, but I'll probably come back here later and seek more advice on that)
- I have one credit card open through Best Buy. It was opened in January 2014 and has a $1000 credit limit. I made a purchase for $650 in July 2014 with 18 months no interest financing and paid it off within 6 months. It has carried a $0 balance since and I have never made a late payment.
- I have a job that pays approximately $300-$500/month. I haven't been able to save much of it lately because I have had some medical expenses this semester that weren't covered by insurance, but going forward I should be good. 
- I just pulled my Experian credit report today, and everything looks good (all green ""OK"" boxes and no accounts I didn't recognize)
- I also did my Credit Sesame score (I know it's not the most accurate, but it's free) and it said it was 668, but it also said I didn't have any credit cards despite having the Best Buy card...
- I've been considering opening a credit card for a while so I can build up my credit just by putting gas and groceries on and it paying it off every month. But, my mom always tells me it's a horrible idea. I love her, but I find it difficult to fully trust her financial advice.
- I currently don't have a job for when I move (the decision to go was in the past couple months, and I've had school and some issues with an internship required for graduation that have kept me extremely busy). But the jobs I am starting to apply for will put me in the $30-$40k range and I am relatively confident I won't have any issued securing one of these jobs (I have a guaranteed job out there as a backup, but it would only put me at around $20k a year, so I'm trying to find something better)
- I realize there will be other expenses on this trip besides just the ticket. I will definitely have the money for those expenses, the ticket is just the only big thing.
- I also realize that given my financial standing, this trip doesn't look like the best idea. But I'd very much like to go apartment hunting and I also pretty much never get to go on vacation except to the Gulf once every other year with my giant family.


I have no doubt that I would be able to pay for the flight by saving my money, but I'd prefer to purchase the ticket within the next 3ish weeks. If I save my money, I would be cutting it too close for my comfort. Using the money I have saved for the move makes me kind of uncomfortable, but if a credit card is just a really bad option, then I'll do it. My other option would be a loan from my mom, but I'd like to avoid that.

**So again**:
Would it be worth it to open up a credit card to purchase the ticket now, or should I use my savings? If a credit card isn't a bad idea, what are the best options for low interest rate cards (maybe even student cards if I can keep the card after I stop being a student in a few months)?",finance,1427052079

personalfinance,"About to spend $4000 on student loans, just wanted to run this by /r/personalfinance to make sure this is a decent idea.","Hello, /r/personalfinance! I have recently freed up around $4000 from a low-yield CD (0.3% interest rate) and I'm looking to put that cash toward paying down my remaining student loans. The loans that I have left are as follows:

* Loan A: ~$9000 with a minimum payment of $114/month, 6.8% interest rate
* Loan B: ~$4000 with a minimum payment of $44/month, 4.5% interest rate

All-told, I have close to $8500 in the bank between checking and savings. I make around $2300 per month and have monthly expenses totaling near $1600.

What I plan on doing, though it isn't the financially-optimal avalanche method, is to use the freed-up cash to pay off loan B. That cuts out $44 in monthly expenses and, after my upcoming paycheck minus expenses, leaves me with close to $5000 as my 3-month emergency fund spread across checking (one month's worth of expenses) and a high-yield savings account (two month's expenses at 0.99%). Since I won't have to continue saving for my emergency fund and will have paid off three loans totaling $160/month, I will begin funneling any available extra cash toward the remaining loan and hopefully pay it off within a year.

So, /r/personalfinance, is there anything that I've missed in my plan? This will be the most money I've ever spent at one time, so I want to make sure that I've considered all potential aspects of this decision before I pull the trigger. Any and all advice is appreciated.",finance,1427055123

Bitcoin,Tax implications of loss/theft/insolvency of Bitcoin investments,"I was reading through the instructions for [IRS Form 4684 for 2014](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i4684.pdf) and it seems like there are a couple scenarios where Bitcoin losses might be tax deductible. Full disclosure I'm not a tax professional or expert and you should consult your own tax adviser before filing anything or making decisions.

**CAPITAL LOSS**
Selling trading, or purchasing goods with Bitcoin can be reported as a capital loss on Schedule D, if the fair market value on the date of sale was less than the adjusted basis.  This is the standard way that most US Bitcoiners will have to report Bitcoin losses or gains to the IRS.  This is also covered in depth by others who know more than me so I won't go into more detail.

**THEFT**
Bitcoins that were stolen from you qualify for Form 4684, providing you can prove, in accordance with [IRS Pub 547,](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p547.pdf) that the coins were yours and that they were stolen.  For example the [Coinapult theft earlier this month](http://dcmagnates.com/coinapult-doing-forensics-on-150-btc-theft-rest-of-funds-safe/) would seem to meet the IRS requirements for this type of loss of an individual's Bitcoins. Proving the stolen coins were yours if the IRS questions your return is a tough but solvable issue, but I'm not really sure how anyone could prove the coins were stolen in the first place.  This seems like a huge trust/credibility gap that any exchange or service has to overcome when reporting that funds were stolen.  How does the IRS, or a customer for that matter, know that the wallets where the funds now reside are not also controlled by the party claiming loss?  This complication makes claiming a loss due to theft a bit risky in my mind, but others may disagree.

Pub 547 also provides special rules which apply specifically to Ponzi scheme losses; however, the guidance specifically excludes mislaid or lost property from meeting the definition of a theft.  This would indicate if you simply lost/erased your private keys or accidentally sent your Bitcoin to a wrong address that wouldn't count as theft, but it could qualify as a casualty.

**CASUALTY**
A casualty is defined as the loss of property by an identifiable event that is sudden, unexpected, or unusual. In addition to meeting the sudden, unexpected, and unusual tests, Pub 547 also addresses what factors must be proven to support the deduction of a casualty loss. 

The guidance lists a bunch of deductible losses and some exceptions which are non-deductible, but few of them seem to be relevant to the kinds of situations most Bitcoiners are likely to face.  If access to your private keys is cut off because a computer was destroyed due to fire, flood, earthquake, etc, that would seem to qualify as a casualty loss, as would the computer storing the keys.  Also of note is that progressive deterioration and your own negligence would probably disallow you from claiming a casualty loss, so make sure to make backups, especially if the computer/phone running your wallet software is getting old or prone to data loss.  This probably also means simply misplacing your private keys, or writing down a brain wallet incorrectly wouldn't qualify for a casualty loss, though I'm not very confident of this interpretation and would love if someone with more expertise would clarify this point.

**LOSS ON DEPOSITS**
Finally, according to the guidance, a loss on deposits occurs when a bank, credit union, or other financial institution becomes insolvent or bankrupt.  One question is what would officially constitute a 'financial institution'.  I'm not sure about non-financial services or apps like [ChangeTip](https://www.changetip.com/) or [Purse.IO,](https://purse.io/) but it would make sense that Bitcoin exchanges would qualify.

If you lose deposited funds, you can elect to treat the loss in one of three ways: as an ordinary loss, a casualty loss, or a nonbusiness bad debt. The rules get a bit complicated here, but my reading is that a nonbusiness bad debt may only be claimed if and when the amount lost is actually known and officially determined; whereas, a casualty or ordinary loss may be elected based on estimates and before an official determination is made.  Because of this distinction I think a nonbusiness bad debt cannot be claimed until a customer knows what, if any, amount of a bankrupt institution's funds will be liquidated to cover the customer's deposit losses.  Sorry [Mt. Gox creditors,](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2892892/one-year-later-were-no-closer-to-finding-mtgoxs-missing-millions.html) you may have to wait a while if you want to elect this option.

The guidance also specifies where to report the loss of deposit based on what type of loss is elected.  Ordinary losses go on Schedule A, line 23 and are subject to floor and ceiling limits.  Also of note is an ordinary loss cannot be elected if the deposit is federally insured (e.g. FDIC).  Casualty losses, also subject to limitations, are reported on Form 4684 and Schedule A, and nonbusiness bad debts go on Form 8949 and Schedule D.

So that's basically my reading of IRS guidance as it relates to the deductibility of Bitcoin losses.  Again, I'm not an expert or a tax professional, but I'm interested to hear your comments, corrections, and input.

personalfinance,"PF, How would you allocate these funds?","Hey everyone, 
Curious to hear your thoughts around how to best structure our funds. 

Current Situation:

* Combined income: 190k 

Currently we have a few bills that we need to knock out. SO has about 82k in student loans that are at an extremely low .5% interest rate. Aside from that we have our typical Mortgage, Bills, and everything else. We budget well, so I figured I'd omit the totals there as it's not really relevant. What I'm curious about is how we should invest our leftover income. 

My Opinion:

With how low the student loan interest rate is, I don't view that as bad debt. I'm happy to pay that down over time, assuming the money is saved more efficiently elsewhere. 

That being said, I'd like focus our growth by:

* Emergency fund is already at 30k, so maintain that.  

* 401k Match to employer 6% (both me and SO)

* ESPP 10% (max program allows) 

* 529 for education (want to pay for private HS education and college, 3 kids is plan)

* IRA Match to limit


That's my idea for how to structure in order. Another thing worth noting is the house we live in is valued around $475,000 with about $230,000 left.. Interest rate is low, refinanced last year to 3.2%. The student loan is through a program my work is partnered in, so if I were to leave we'd have to pay that back. I have no intentions on leaving, and the likelihood of me losing my current position is, while not impossible, highly unlikely. 

So that's where I'm currently at. Any opinions on a better way to structure it out? Should we focus on mortgage of student loan even though the rates are low? I'd also love to hear thoughts on how to invest inside the IRA.

financialindependence,Which is better: paid off home or inventment property?,"I left my country of origin a decade ago but did not sell my home there. I rented it out using a property management company and since then the rental income along with a bit of cash gifted by my parents I have effectively paid off the mortgage - excellent. Just for clarity; when I say paid off, I have sufficient money in a current account to pay off the mortgage account but have not done so yet. The accounts are linked such that any money in the current account saves me interest on the debt held in the mortgage account. Following so far? 

So this gets interesting in that I am close to paying off the mortgage on my current home in my new country of residence. Maybe only another 18 months of making the additional payments and I will be there. I am torn as the income from my old home is now accumulating into savings that I will do something with in the coming years, invest, buy more property, something. Or.... I could withdraw enough from the current account over there to pay off my home mortgage. I cant decide what to do. 

On the face of it the cost of borrowing where I live now is considerably higher than where my investment property is. I got a base rate tracking mortgage so I would be paying circa 0.5% interest.

personalfinance,Funding a 2014 Traditional IRA,"Hi PF! Long time follower, first time poster.

Following through with  my 2014 taxes (1040A). Single, not head of household, AGI of $44,800, California resident.

I will be getting a few hundred back in Federal and State taxes. I can double my this amount by contributing the full $5500 to a 2014 Traditional IRA. 
If I do this, how can I fund the account? 
Do I do this pre-tax through payroll? 
I definitely won't make $5500 by April 15th. Do I go out of pocket for the remaining?

While I'm here, I can ask:
After I take the tax refund for 2014, I can (in the future) convert this traditional IRA into a Roth IRA?",finance,1427092327

personalfinance,The logic/wisdom of replacing expensive student loan debt with a much cheaper car loan interest rate (explanation to the madness inside).,"A bit on my current situation. I'm a recent graduate coming out of school with ~$40k in debt, at a rate of 6.8% (from unsubsidsed stafford loans), of which I have ~10k sitting in my bank account unused (I overestimated my living expenses). My current car is over 15 years old and dying, so as a graduation gift, my parents are offering to contribute $20k towards a $30k dollar car. The kicker is, as we were researching purchasing the car, we found that my bank is willing to give a loan of up to 120% of the cars value at **1.47%**. The terms from their own explanation are that I can pay with the car in cash, and then take the loan money as reimburssment, ie the loan money does not need to go directly to the dealer

This of course raised an interesting idea, in that I could take out a $30k (instead of just the $10k that I actually NEED) car loan at 1.47%, and since my parents are paying $20k to the car, I can use the $20k extra car loan dollars (@1.47%) to pay off the more expensive student loan debt (@6.8%). 

In summary: (before ----&gt; after)

Student loan debt: $40,000 ---&gt; $40,000 @6.8% over 10 years

Car loan debt: $0 ---&gt; $10,000 @1.47% over 5 years



**OR**

Student loan debt: $40,000 ---&gt; $20,000 @ 6.8% over 10 years

Car loan debt: $0 ---&gt; $30,000 @1.47% over 5 years

---------

Im not a fan of debt, nor am I a fan of car loans as they are usually a terrible deal. I am fairly frugal and have no other debts besides my student loans. Am I crazy for thinking that in this situation, the car loan deal my bank is offering is too good to pass up?

personalfinance,I'm a soon to be graduate student who needs advice on managing student loan and credit card debt,"As the title says, I'm going to be starting graduate school this fall working toward a PhD. The school is offering to fully cover my tuition, fees, health insurance, and is guaranteeing a salary of $18,500 per academic year in the form of TAships with the opportunity to TA during the summer session for another roughly $5000. I'm discussing other funding opportunities with my advisor (for presumably more than I would make as a TA), but for now this is the salary I know for sure I can make. The school is located in an area with a fairly high cost of living (average 1bd apartment price is $1200/month, average studio is $900-1000).


I will be making the move to school with my fiancee, who is planning to go part time to a nearby community college while working part time. So there will be additional income from her end, but it's up in the air at the moment as to how much she'll be bringing in. Our tentative plan is to move down in mid-July, since my advisor has funding available to get me started doing research over the summer (we haven't discussed how much yet). Luckily we will not need to have a car in the area we're living in, so that's one expense I don't have to worry about.


That's essentially what the situation will be. I'm coming out of my undergraduate with $40,367.00 in student loan debt, and another $4494.39 in credit card debt. Of the student loan debt, $19,000 is in unsubsidized Stafford loans, and it has accrued $1367 of interest during the time I've been in school.  My credit card has an interest rate of 7.9%. Unfortunately, it is pretty close to being maxed out, I haven't used it in several months but I'm struggling to chip away at the balance while in school. Despite that, my credit score is currently somewhere are 690, so at least it isn't terrible.


I'm looking for advice on how to tackle this debt going forward. I will be living on limited income as a grad student, and I'm still working on how to budget out living expenses. My instinct is that I need to first tackle the credit card debt since it carries the highest interest rate, but I don't know what a reasonable payment toward it should look like. I also feel that I should try to start tackling the interest that is accruing on my unsubed student loans before it capitalizes after grad school. I've worked out that it's growing by $80.48/month.

Here's the slightly longer story. 3 years ago my wife and I took severance packages from our jobs at Best Buy (at the same time, right before the birth of my first son) and started in real estate. The plan was for me to work full time and make money hand over fist and for her to stay at home with the kids. Well apparently it's harder than it looks....we did okay eventually but the hole has been dug. 

I took a job with a new home builder that has a base salary and commission on top of that. The base is enough to scrape by on but the average sales person pay is significantly higher so between that and my wife continuing the real estate business we can ""see the light at the end of the tunnel."" However, we need some short term help and I have been looking into debt consolidation programs. Honestly it seems like a good deal for us at the moment, the fees are ""equivalent to about 7% interest rates over the term"" but are actually about 20% of the debt itself.

In addition, if any wealthy patron is willing to purchase my loans and have my repayments go to you, I am all ears.

Graduated medical school in 2012, about to graduate residency this summer (6/2015) to start a three year Cardiology fellowship (7/2015-6/2018), will likely pursue an additional 1-2 year Interventional/Peripheral fellowship (7/2018-6/2020).  All US-ACGME accredited, legit programs; worked my pants off to get here.

Currently, my loan total is approximately $250,000, consolidated with an approximate interest rate of 7% (through Navient).  I'm making minimal income base repayments each month, but its not making a dent; I'd have to be paying approximately $18000 a year to keep up with interest.  By the time I'm fully done with my training and making a normal Cardiologist's salary, and assuming I defer payments til then, my loans will have ballooned to approximately $375,000 by the end of 2020.

Granted, I'll be making income based repayments until then (currently paying back approximately $500 per month), but just wanted to illustrate how big that number could potentially grow with capitalized interest.

SO:
1. Any advice or recommendations regarding refinancing this beast?

That's not to say that I won't do well outside the profession but it is certainly an unknown.

&amp;nbsp;

  


  Thus, I come to the PF community for advice and strategy. I need to make an action-plan on how to tackle these loans. Finance is not my specialty and the information out there is all over the place. I also feel like my loan servicer (great lakes) has no incentive to help me.  

&amp;nbsp;


  **Some more background:**  
Initially, I enrolled in Income-Based Repayment to build savings. I never had more than a few-thousand dollars to my name so it's nice to see $36,000 in the bank for rainy day, potential investment opportunity, or down-payment for home. I know I threw good money away at interest in order to accomplish this, but I personally feel much more comfortable now that I have some savings if I need it.  Was this a good/bad idea?  

&amp;nbsp;


  
  **The Loans:**  
Stafford Loans - $23K @ 6.550%  
Grad Plus FFEL - $21K @ 8.250%  
Direct Grad Plus - $37K @ 7.650%  
Stafford Loans - $47K @ 6.550%  

&amp;nbsp;



  **The questions:**  
I could really use some guidance on whether to stick with income-based repayment (barely covering interest) because of my uncertain future? Or whether I should focus on killing this debt? If the answer is kill the debt, how should I accomplish this? Slow and steady...it is a student loan after all? 10-year vs. 25-year? Consolidate?* I have no problem living frugally so please, throw the book at me.  

&amp;nbsp;



  *What is the catch with consolidation? I suspect it has to do with the variable interest rates.  Is it safe to assume that the variable interest rates will go up during repayment? Any suggestions on who to use?  

&amp;nbsp;


  
  **My resources:**  
Each month I should have roughly $2,000 after rent, utilities, car, food, insurance, etc. This does not include travel expenses (weddings, etc.) nor any savings beyond my Roth 401K to which I already contribute the max available.

Long time lurker, follower, and knowledge absorber. Since becoming an avid lurker of this sub a little over a year ago, I’ve attended to my personal finance situation as best I can and would like your opinion on how I am doing and where I can improve. I’d also appreciate if you refrained from negative feedback regarding my decision to take on this much debt through undergrad and grad school. Trust me, I give myself enough negative feedback for all of you. Also, please forgive any formatting issues, this is my first post!

**Relevant information:**  
29/single, US    
I do not have a car payment and I do not pay for rent. I also do not contribute to a retirement plan, at this time. In November, I will be required to start contributing to my employer’s 401(a) retirement plan. My goal is to create a decent emergency fund first.  
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 
**Edit:** I will now cap this EF out at $6000 and use the $300 towards eliminated the Navient student loan. I'll also look into moving this to an account that with a higher interest rate.       
Current emergency fund: $4,600 (I put $300/month towards building an emergency fund. Eventual goal is to have an emergency fund of about 6 months of expenses, which is ~$10,700). I do not include the $300 as part of my monthly income. I consider this part of my paycheck as ‘untouchable’ money. It’s kept in a savings account with a local credit union at 0.01% APY and automatically deducted out of my paycheck. 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 
 
I work in a career field that is growing and will be working towards a higher position with a higher salary throughout my career. Meaning, my salary is anticipated to increase, albeit slowly. 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 
 **Monthly Budget**  
&amp;nbsp;  
 
**Income:** Monthly income after deductions: **$2,275** (Deductions include: Social security, fed/state taxes, health insurance, and employee parking) 
 
&amp;nbsp; 

  
**Expenses**  
 * Groceries: $250  
 * Electric: $55  
 * Gas (apartment): $30  
 * Internet: $30  
 * Cell phone: $78 **EDIT:** I will be looking into Ting or Republic wireless--thank you!  
 * Gas (car): $200  
 * Car insurance: $89  
 * Gym: $40 **EDIT:** This will drop to $25 next month. And will be dropped completely in September.  
 * Entertainment: $150  
 * Furniture: $20 (0% interest for 20 months)  
 * Credit card: I try not to accrue much credit card debt. If I accrue cc debt, it is a small amount and is paid off in full each month. I also utilize some of my emergency funds to pay off, if necessary. Example, this month I needed to update my eyeglass prescription—the $100 cost to do so was put on my cc and I will use my emergency fund to pay that off.  
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 

**Total Expenses: $942**  
  
&amp;nbsp; 
  
**Student Loans**  
**Federal Loans**: $84,330.87. Monthly payment **$235** interest varies between all loans.  I am currently utilizing the Income Based Repayment Plan. I’m also employed by a non-profit organization and given my career choice, will likely stay in the government/non-profit sector. Thus, I will hopefully be taking advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and will be federal student loan debt free by 2023.  
&amp;nbsp;  

The below are private student loans and do not qualify for Income Based Repayment or Public Service Loan Forgiveness.    
**Navient:** $8,973.57 at 8.25%. Monthly payment $105, but I pay **$150** since this is a high interest rate    
**Aspire Student Loan A):** $17,619 at 2.4%. Monthly payment **$115**  
**Aspire Student Loan B):** $3,284 at 4.43%. Monthly payment **$24**  
**Aspire Student Loan C):** $8,414.79 at 4.43%. Monthly payment **$61**  
**Chase Student Loan A):** $10,598.59 at 5.1%. Monthly payment **$80**  
**Chase Student Loan B):** $36,577.92 at 8.25%. Monthly payment $345, but I pay **$400** since this is a high interest rate **EDIT** I will stop overpaying on this one and move my payment towards Navient to knock out Navient first since they're the same interest rate.    
 
 **Total Student Loans: $1,063**  
 
&amp;nbsp; 
  
 
Each month there is about ~$270 left over between total expenses and total income. Most of the time, part of the left over money is eaten up by an oil change (once every three months), credit card debt, unexpected cost, or simply (and stupidly) over spending. If there’s anything additional left over it gets added to the following month’s overpayment on the 8.5% loans.

**What I do to save money:**  
 * Pack lunch, daily  
 * Carpool to work (I live 55 miles from my work). Saves money on parking and gas.  
 * Cook dinners at home during the week  
 * If I’m running errands, I’ll often pack snacks to avoid buying a snack out  
 * RSVP ‘no’ to as many trips with friends, weddings, bachelorette parties, and birthday and dinner outings as possible without losing friends/family over it  
 * Bring a flask to the bar so I don’t pay for drinks. I generally limit myself to $15-20/night. Or host friends at my place, go to there house and simply hang out.    
 * Suppress my desire to travel (sigh)  
 * Go to yearly doctor check-ups as a preventative measure both for health and cost reasons.  

&amp;nbsp; 
  
**Future goals (~10 years):**  
 * Have the ability to travel without breaking the bank  
 * Support a family (housing, kids, dogs) and not have my loans be a burden on my family’s finances or living  
 * Have a decent retirement fund given the short period I will have been contributing by then

gaming,Does anyone else think that gaming causes more problems than it's worth?,"Think about it, it costs a shit load of money, it's one of the most money grabbing industries around, if we die we get stressed and angry, my most recent purchase was Battlefield: Hardline. Now I've been gaming for 20 years and I've always been one of those gamers who are sometimes fucking amazing and sometimes shit, right now I can't even be bothered to try, nothing draws me into these games anymore it just feels like the same recycled shit boxed up and fed to us every year. 

I much prefer a chilled game like Oblivion/Fallout where I can play at a nice pace, discover interesting things and just take in the scenery whilst creating a story within a world, where are those games? (I haven't got a PC so don't even dangle that carrot)

That escapism is what we need after 8 hours of working for the man, or whoever you work for. I'm ranting a bit, I guess what I'm trying to say is I had a moment tonight where I thought ""fuck it"" I'm done playing games that stress me out, shit I'm done playing games right now, maybe I'm just getting too old for this shit. This isn't a bash at gamers or this community I'm just looking for some opinions or maybe some help on how I can breathe some life into my gaming, I'm really struggling here. 

Edit: just to clarify, people are allowed to get angry and stressed at games, it's a natural reaction, for me it's becuase I'm competitive. Secondly I never said spent a ton of money on games either, whether I have or not is besides the point, I haven't got ""personality flaws"" because I don't like getting killed over and over or spammed/hacked, for someone to say that is just dickish it really is.",technology,1427139453
personalfinance,"A few questions with regard to savings account, compounded interest, and 401k.","Ok. A little background on me - I don't know jack about most of this stuff. So if you could ELi5, that'd be helpful.  

I just graduated college and will soon be making a considerable amount of money.  I have no debt/credit cards, no children, I rent cheap, my (current) car is paid for. So, the fact that I'll have a nice paycheck and not much to be spending on, means that I can save up. 

I came across this post somewhere about starting a compounded interest savings for you children (which again - to be clear, I do not have children) when they're born... putting in $1000 the day of their birth and $300/month every month thereafter. At an 8.38% compounded interest rate - in 21 years - this would mean you could be getting $2435 deposited into your regular bank account. I had no reason to question this or assume it was inaccurate - so, if it is, you can let me know!

So the question is - I want to save money... and if I can compound interest in a savings account, it sounds like an awesome plan from my understanding (which is of course limited) - so 1) is this possible? 2) How does compounded interest work, and how do you get the best interest rates? The post I read was referring to starting that for a child - which would be peer-to-peer (e.g. Lending Club) .. so is this even a possibility? 3) Is this the best route to go for investment planning?

The second part to the question is - with having a 401K, can you always just keep putting money in it like a savings account? For example... you make a little extra money this month and you're like ""Nice, I'll add that to the 401K."" (so your company will match it) And if you can't do that - would the best way to ""invest"" your money be the compounded interest savings account? Or is there a better way to save/invest/plan?

personalfinance,Financially Ignorant - Trying to stop being afraid and grab hold of this trainwreck...,"I've been neglecting myself for too long due to my own fear of success and money.  And I'm trying to set my family baggage aside and stop being afraid of improving my life.  It's been small steps the last few years, I've graduated college with a degree in IT and I'm independent and somewhat steady.  However, I've been in a serious relationship for some time and I've only been able to stay afloat thanks to room-mates.  The two of us are about to get our own place, but I'm horrified of what steps to take...

&amp;nbsp;

Monthly I bring in no less than $2250.  Overtime is readily available and this can climb as high as $3000 but I don't ever plan for such.

&amp;nbsp;

My expenses are as follows:  
**Phone:** $40  
**Car:**: $134 (Insurance Only)  
**Gas:** $150  
**Utilities:** $90  
**Rent:** $200  (Currently 5 room mates.)  
**Food:** $400  

&amp;nbsp;

Rent is likely to spike as we move out, but utilities should go down as we'll be in a smaller place, likely an apartment instead of a house.  At some point I'll have to start paying on my student loans again.  I was recently unemployed and deferred them, but I was paying based on my income and the payments were around $80.  **Currently I owe $55,000 in federal student loans.**

&amp;nbsp;

The current scenario is that my partner is an artist and has been living rather bohemian for well over a decade.  We're talking circus, martial arts training, and odd-job performances.  They are able to 'get by' but have never been able to save enough for taxes and they are getting wrecked by them every year and it's become a severe struggle.

On the other hand, I've also introduced them to programming in the last two years and they've become very good at it.  Yet, with both of us kinda lost and lacking confidence in how to get jobs/careers started - they want to pursue college before plunging into the field.  (That and they have zero work history thanks to 12 years of odd jobs.)  The only problem is, they have no car to get them to school and/or whatever fast-food job they can pick up on the side.

&amp;nbsp;

I've managed to save up **$2500** and should be able to save up a little more between now and our move.  I'm considering buying my partner a crummy, cheap car to help them go to college.  And I'm trying to improve my current job situation by studying for my CCNA (Cisco) which can greatly improve my ability to find a better job in IT.  Is there something better I can do with my money?  Or a better way to plan?  Honestly, I don't even know what questions to ask...  my strategy the last few years has been to just be overly cautious and pessimistic and 'pretend' I make less money than I do and never spend too much.

The pay is not great, but I love what I do and I always come out ahead. I don't have any problems with short-term budgeting and tend to be pretty frugal. My family has helped a lot and are covering my undergrad student loans and let me stay with them when I can't find work (sometimes for a few months at a time). I've managed to saved up a decent amount and I'm trying to figure out the best way to go forward.

I have about 56k combined between savings and checking accounts plus an additional 13k in an equity fund that a relative set up for me. I want to consolidate my banking assets so that it's all with one bank, so I'm thinking about moving some of that money at the same time to be more useful.

I have a rough idea of what to do with the 56k, but I'd like your input, since I would not consider myself especially financially savvy. I honestly have no concept of whether my plan or its parts are overly cautious or too risky.

11k for savings (to get a slightly higher interest rate),

2k in checking,

14k for buying and maintaining a used car/truck in the next few years (probably put in savings account for now),

an additional 8k emergency fund (probably put in savings account),

11k in a Roth IRA (for 2014 and 2015),

and 10k in the equity fund.

My wife and I are currently on a company-sponsored house-hunting trip for the new job I'm transferring into. We have already been pre-qualified by several lenders, and pre-approved by one. I would like to get the best possible mortgage in terms of interest rates and closing costs.

We will (hopefully) be putting in an offer on a place this week, or within 2 months if this trip is unsuccessful (they will put us in temporary housing if we don't have anything lined up).

**My plan:**

1. Put in and get accepted on offer.

2. Determine the exact total amount we will be putting down to cover both closing costs and down payment.

3. Email/contact all of the lenders that I have been in touch with: ""As you know from our prior conversations, we are in the process of buying our first home. We have found and agreed to buy a house for $X. We have $Y to spend total on a down payment and all closing costs. What is the best offer that you could give us for a 30 year fixed mortgage? As you know, we have been in contact with many lenders. We will be comparing your offer to theirs, and will be basing our decision on the total monthly payments based on a fixed value of $Y for total closing and down payment costs.""

4. Lenders send me all of their offers. Choose the one with the lowest monthly payment.

Is this a good plan? Can I reasonably expect this many lenders to play ball? I'm assuming that I will have to apply for a loan from each lender, which may incur some application fees. Has anyone else done this before?

Thanks for reading!

personalfinance,I'm about to take on a lot of debt- does this make sense to you? Advice appreciated!,"Here are the basics:

I have just under $14,000 in student loan debt from my first undergraduate degree (all subsidized: $3,079 at 6%, $5,000 at 5.6%, and $5,383 at 4.5%). I have paid this down from $23,000 in three years while on a salary of around $20,000/year by being extremely frugal and putting all extra income towards the high-interest unsubsidized loans. 

I was just accepted into an amazing Nurse Midwifery program that is a BSN and masters degree in 3 years. Starting salary for midwives is ~$80,000 and the field maxes out at around $125,000 annual salary. 

This is what I anticipate/estimate for the full three years:

I will be taking out $61,500 in unsubsidized loans (6.21% interest rate). I will have to take out this money in order to get the scholarships offered. I then will need to take out an additional $90,000 in either GradPlus loans (7.21% interest rate) or private loans (unknown but potentially cheaper interest rate). In preliminary and conservative options (overestimating everything), I will graduate with close to $200,000 in student loan debt. I fully intend to budget closely and try to reduce how much I take out. I also will be working the last two years of the program and applying for outside scholarships and grants. I expect this total to be lower but I prefer planning for the worse.

I would really appreciate some feedback on my options for this additional $90,000. My first option is getting GradPlus loans and then working through the Public Service Forgiveness Program. As I am in the nursing field, I am pretty positive that I will be eligible for this program (please let me know if I am mistaken). I estimate I will pay $700-$1,000/month in an income-based repayment plan. If I fulfill the ten years, I estimate that ~$75,000 would be forgiven.

I've done separate federal and state filings in the past to do free files, so that was the plan. Now I'm having trouble. One of the sites I visited said that filers need to e-file the federal and state taxes together (I don't remember what it was). Is that accurate? Then I went to 1040now and entered all of my forms, and it was just confusing. I don't even know if it would have let me file state alone. I gave up when it kept telling me that I need to meet an income and residency requirement to qualify for free file (both of which I meet), and since I didn't qualify (lies), I would have to pay (no thanks). Then I went to Average1040 and entered everything again. It looked like it was going to let me do my state alone (maybe?), but the amount owed was way more than what TaxAct calculated. I quadruple checked my data entry, and of course, each edit changed the amount. It finally ended up being $143, vs TaxAct's $1. So then I thought, ""Well, the prompts are more confusing on Average1040, so maybe I'm still making a mistake. I'll go back to TaxAct."" It looks like I can't add a state to my federal e-file. Why the hell didn't I just pay the damn $17.99?

Maybe my brain just isn't working anymore after several hours of this. I have always used TurboTax, but because I had so many extra forms this year, it would've cost me $40 just to file (I switched jobs in Feb after only 6 months, and the job I switched from had an HSA and a retirement account that had too little balance to roll over, so I got a distribution. I also had student loan interest payments. So many forms.). Even with the preparation software, I still don't really know if I'm entering data correctly. I've never struggled with taxes before, but then again, I've never had retirement and HSA distributions before. At this point, I don't even trust that my federal filing was correct. Any ideas about what I should do next?

Edit: Forgot to mention that Average1040 calculated my federal tax owed to be $45 less than TaxAct, but all other info was the same. I also found an additional retirement tax owed amount (form 1040, line 59) of $46 on TaxAct when I understood there to be no additional tax owed, so that's frustrating.

personalfinance,Need help with Federal Debt Collection,"I am looking for some advice on how to proceed. 

2008 - I separated from the military under a university scholarship. As part of the separation, I agreed to pay back some of the funds that had been awarded as part of the scholarship. There were no definite numbers at the time, but I was under the impression it was ~$15,000.00. This agreement was done informally, but the oringal terms of the contract I had signed back in 2004 gave them the ability to do this. I was told at the time that they would forward the information to DFAS, the military's accounting branch, who would follow up with me at a later date. I never heard from them.

2008- I graduated school in the midst of the Great Recession with a generally useless degree. I lived with my parents, worked two crappy full time jobs, and put every penny into paying off my student loans (which I did, yay me). Upon completion of the payments after about 12 months, I contacted DFAS to follow up on where things were at. I was surprised I hadn't received the paperwork for the payment yet, but since the military is slow moving, I wasn't exactly shocked. I wanted to start making payments on the money I owed them. At this time, they refused to acknowledge I even existed in the system. I frantically called around to various agencies, including my old station, which all refused to acknowledge anything. It seems like my personnel file went missing at this time. DFAS refused to take payments from me when I asked. I should note, that at this time I was not entirely sure what the result was going to be.  I assumed I owed money, but I never received a bill of any kind, and technically it was up to their discretion if they collected based on the 2004 agreement. In other words, they didn't HAVE to collect the money.

2008-2010 - I occasionally phoned DFAS and my personnel unit to question the status, and was always told they had nothing. I didn't push the issue too hard, as it appeared they had lost my file. No point pushing it, I thought. If they didn't make the request, I was under no obligation to pay them.

2010 - After leaving one of the jobs to restore my sanity and struggling to latch onto an actual career, I decided to return to school. I applied to and was accepted to graduate school with an estimated price tag of $105,000. Prior to attending, I phoned DFAS one last time, which assured me I did not owe them any money, and would not unless they received something from personnel.  Personnel confirmed to me that they had no file on me, and that they were not sending anything to DFAS.  With those assurances, I took on the debt.

2012 - Everything is going well. I'm on track to graduate, when I get blindsided by a letter from DFAS demanding payment of over $18,000 within 30 days. I called and requested some documentation. They sent me documentation with a 4 year gap in the paperwork. It is rather clear (to me) that the paperwork was lost and then found. This paperwork appeared to be in order. I was livid given the fact they promised me they would not seek to collect this money. I did not have a way to pay any money, I had stretched all sources of credit I could obtain to my schooling. 

Here is where I made my mistake: I ignored it, thinking they had to go to court to collect. I just intended to present my side at court. I told them this. 

2013 - Graduated school (again) and found a decent paying job where I can finally keep my head above water. Barely. I feel like an adult for the first time in my life.

2013 - They sent it to collections. This is the first and only time I've actually had to deal with collections. I requested probably a dozen times that I disputed the debt given the assurances that were made to me and the reliance I made on those assurances. Every time, it was some internal person who reviewed the paperwork and rubber-stamped a denial. It was never in front of an independent judge, and I was never allowed to present my side. I was harassed. I invoked my rights and ignored them. I told them I wanted my day in court, and if they wanted the money, to file the paperwork. Collections was demanding the original amount plus $6000 for collection fees. I started to consider settling the matter despite my principles, given that I DID agree to this (albeit 5 years prior). I started to discuss with them how to do this.

End of 2014 - They started garnishing my wages without notice. ~15% of my non-taxed income. I was basically living paycheck to paycheck at this point, and it hit me hard. My student loans were about 50% of my non-taxed income. With this added in, I lost 30% of my effective living money. I got some help from family until I was able to stabilize my money flow, but it hurt. I asked my HR about it. They sent me paperwork that appears to be in order. Apparently the Treasury Department (because it was originally with the military) doesn't require a judgment to garnish wages... something I never thought possible. It appeared they had used the information I had given them during discussions to set up a garnishment against me. To consider relief, they wanted more information. I do not trust them at all.

Now - I need help with dealing with the crediting agency. I've spent the last few months attempting to contact the collection agency, but they refuse to discuss the matter with me now unless I fill out a financial disclosure form that appears to just be something they wish to use against me. I've refused to fill it out so far, but they are refusing the settle the matter (I presume because I have a garnishment). I'd like to just settle the debt for the original amount, take out a personal loan, and pay it back at a rate I can stomach (all in all, it seems to be a fair resolution as far as I can see). But I have been hitting a brick wall with that approach. Again, I think it's because of the garnishment. They just refuse to talk to me about settling it with a lump payment short of full payment.

I recently took a new job with a higher salary but very few benefits... something I don't wish to disclose to the collection agency. If they garnish my new wages, the $ they will recover due to the % rules will nearly double (because of fewer pre-tax deductions), and it will hurt badly... I will be paying almost $2,000/mo between my student loans and the garnishment. I can't realistically afford that and maintain anywhere near the quality of living I had for the past year (which is not lavish by any means). My last paycheck from my old job will arrive in a few weeks, at which point they will realize the well has dried up. I'm not really sure what will happen at that point.

I realize I handled this poorly in the past.  I'm not very good with finances, and I like to stick my head in the sand when I can. But I need to address it now, and I'm not sure what the best route is. I've contemplated hiring an attorney, but I'm not sure what that can even accomplish at this point. It is wrecking my credit, and I feel like I'm lost. But out of principal, I don't feel I should have to pay a collection fee for this.

Please help! I feel lost. I really have no idea how to handle this. I do not trust the collection agency one bit.",finance,1427153177

personalfinance,Need opinions on paying off this student loan or keeping it for as long as possible (~1.8% interest rate),"Hello there!

I'd like to get opinions on my situation: I have student loans with total of about $40k left due on them. The current interest rate is about 1.6%. Since I've made some extra payments now and then, the next due date is only some time in 2018. The payments are about $300 a month. The term is in 20 years or so.

Because of these pre-payments, the lender confirmed that I can stop payments altogether until the actual due date in 2018 and still be in good standing. The interests would accrue during that period and the interest rate would then go up by .25% (because there's a discount if auto-pay is set up and auto-pay has to be at least the monthly payment).

Option A is to keep paying if off (I was even adding another $50 every month) to get rid of it earlier, which always feels good.

Option B: until I *have* to make a payment, because of the low interest rate, it seems more advantageous to not make the payments and instead invest the money. (or put the money towards the mortgage)

I should also note that that amount doesn't really make a difference in our monthly budget (i.e. we don't have CC debt or anything like that where the money would give a breath of fresh air).

It seems to me that option A (continue payments) would take us towards being debt-free, while option B (redirect money to something else until the next due date) is more likely to increase our net worth overall. Two slightly different goals. I'm leaning towards option B.

Am I thinking of this correctly? I'm a little weary because of how often paying one's student loans is a big goal, whereas that would be aiming for making it last as long as possible. What do you think?
Thanks!

personalfinance,How do I choose the best option for a mortgage? (CA),"I'm about to buy a condo (first purchase). I'm looking at a total final mortgage of about 105,000. 

I've been with my bank since... birth (Scotia). I've never dealt with anyone else except for my ""emergency"" credit card which is with TD. For reference, I'm located in Ontario.

My bank has given me some options - namely a 2 year fixed @ 2.34 or 5 year fixed at 2.79 (which comes out to a difference of $12 bi-weekly). I've checked some other banks and they seem to be all the same. My real estate agent thinks I might be able to do better if I go with a mortgage broker instead of a bank. I've looked around but... I don't know any of these places. She didn't have anywhere to recommend but she thinks 2.64 might be obtainable for 5 years.

How do I decide? Is there a better option? I looked around online at whatever ""ontario mortgage brokers"" came up with in google but their rates don't look any better than the bank is giving me. All my friends just went with their bank. Right now I'm leaning towards 5 years just for the security of where interest rates will be (who knows), and the fact that my student loans will be paid off in less than that, giving me some extra money for when I renegotiate (currently 54 months left $244 a month but I'm putting way more money into it than that on a regular basis so I'm hoping to have it paid off much sooner - I'm already 18 months ahead on payments out of a 10 year loan). 

Just not sure if I have other options since all I have to ask is my bank, and they're of course not going to recommend anyone but themselves.

personalfinance,Student being forced to pay over $700 in taxes.,"California Student attending a UC school.

At my last summer internship, I earned **$7920 in total gross pay**, and paid a total of **$1721** in taxes according to my W-2. This includes Social securty tax withheld($490), medicare tax withheld($115), fed income tax withheld($970), and CA state income tax($142).

This year I paid about **13k in tuition** and **12k in housing costs** for university. I also received a **10k grant** in financial aid, and I took out **$5500 in total Federal/Perkins loans**. Family makes about 85k on FAFSA, and I am a dependent.


Now according to TurboTax, I have to pay an **additional $700** in taxes. This is freaking me out because I already spent the bulk of my earnings to pay off my university fees.

Does this number sound right? I never imagined I would have to pay additional taxes on top of what was already withheld, especially since I've been taking $5500 in federal loans for two years straight.


**EDIT:** I looked at the tax return and it's **counting my grant as income.** TurboTax is telling me that my total income is the grant(10K) + internship earnings(8k) for a total of 18k.
Is this how it's supposed to be?

**EDIT 2:**  My problem has been solved! The mistake was that the grant was entered to be used for Room and Board instead of tuition. Fixed it in TurboTax! I'm now getting a $800 refund.",finance,1427157983

personalfinance,What to do with old Saving Bonds?,"So my grandmother used to give me savings bonds every year and I have 21 of them just sitting around. They are $50 Series EE bonds. The oldest is from 1985 and the newest is 2003. The oldest one is now worth 115.32 and just this year reached final maturity. The newest one is worth 33.62 and won't reach final maturity until 2033. So I have a couple of questions. 

1. Most of the bonds have followed a similar value pattern of around $3-$5 difference in value between years, and then '93 and '94 happen. The '93 bond is worth $75.52 and the '94 bond is worth $57.64. Anyone know why there is a sudden almost $20 drop in value? After that, the difference in value is around $2 between years. '93 and '94 both have the same interest rate of 4%  just '93 has some how made $20 more in interest in it's one extra year of life. Ideas?

2. Should I keep these? The newest bond has an interest rate of 1.49% which is better than a CD so I sort of feel like I should just keep them under the mattress and cash them in when they reach final maturity (30 years) each year. However I do have $2,700 in student loans left with 5+% interest rates so I feel like letting a few bonds sit at 1.49% is just robbing me of money when my student loans are costing me more. The total value of the bonds are $1339.94, so obviously cashing them all in right now wouldn't pay off my loans. My other thought is finding all the bonds that are at 4% and keep those and sell off the ones in the 1.x% range.

Any suggestions would be a great help.",finance,1427164271
personalfinance,Investing a sizable portfolio (whether lottery win or just years long accumulation) to live off the income,"I'm hoping to get some ideas from the hive mind here.

I have been curious about what type of portfolio would allow for easy living off dividend income/capital gains. I'm going off of a $5,000,000 portfolio with a 7.5% annualized return, 5% ($250,000 to start) to be spent every year as income and the other 2.5% kept as principle to roughly keep up with inflation. This would allow, in the first year, $163,514* after all taxes, or $13,626 a month. Thats a huge amount to play with. Even after going all out each month at the bars and paying a high rental/mortgage + car payment, there would still likely be several thousand left over that you could kick back into the portfolio or throw into a vacation fund.

As far as investments are concerned, I'm a huge fan of REIT's, Dividend Stocks, Preferred's, and Bond Funds. One of the first investments I made was in NYMT, a REIT that yields an almost ridiculous 14% (and has been in that vicinity for several years). In addition, Loomis Sayles Floating Rate Fund is at a distribution yield north of 6%, and that firm is second to none as far as fundamental insights into the fixed income markets. Lloyds Banking Group (LYG/PA) is a preferred security yielding 7.61% with a respectable rating. REM is a mortgage ETF yielding 14.12% with a market weight S&amp;P Capital IQ rating.

These are just some of the investments I would make (ideally with a total of 8-10 different positions in the portfolio). I am well aware of the risks a rising rate environment would pose to things like REITs, preferred's, and bonds. That being said, fundamentally strong equity-REITs have actually outperformed in 3 of the last 5 rising rate environments, and floating rate preferred's/bond's also fare pretty well in these environments.

I'm really looking to pick people's brains and find out if this is a realistic return, and if so what sorts of securities would best suit that return goal while faring well in all types of interest rate environments. In addition, please feel free to argue for SMA's or any other types of investment vehicles that would be accessible with that portfolio size. This portfolio would pretty much always give the individual a purchasing power of a quarter million dollars (as the 2.5% growth adds to the principal value over time, so in 2035 it would be 5% of 5000000(1.025)^20 = $409,654) indefinitely, and I think that's all you need to live a pretty great life.

Any input to realize this goal would be much appreciated. I'm in the financial industry and this is the sort of thing I want to make happen over the next 15-25 years (even though I know that range might be a bit optimistic).

finance,Bond experts. Help explaining this bond yield graphic?,"""http://i.imgur.com/TBuvFOg.png

&gt;Property 1: Although the prices of all option-free bonds move in the opposite
direction from the change in yield required, the percentage price change is not the
same for all bonds.
Property 2: For very small changes in the yield required, the percentage price change
for a given bond is roughly the same, whether the yield required increases or
decreases.
Property 3: For large changes in the required yield, the percentage price change is not
the same for an increase in the required yield as it is for a decrease in the required
yield.
Property 4: For a given large change in basis points, the percentage price increase is
greater than the percentage price decrease.
The implication of property 4 is that if an investor owns a bond (i.e., is “long” a bond),
the price appreciation that will be realized if the required yield decreases is greater than the
capital loss that will be realized if the required yield rises by the same number of basis points.
For an investor who is “short” a bond, the reverse is true: The potential capital loss is greater
than the potential capital gain if the required yield changes by a given number of basis points.
An explanation for these four properties of bond price volatility lies in the convex shape
of the price–yield relationship. We will investigate this in more detail later in the chapter""

So I'm looking at this in my book and I'm very confused.

For example, yield goes down from 9% (This is YTM right?) to 6%.

Meaning that the bond got discounted 3% less now. So price goes up. 

But aren't bonds that offer yields lower than the market yield/interest rates(9%) discount bounds and should be sold at a discount? I just didn't understand 4-3 at all. Or am I assuming that the market yield is 9% here?

I think this graphic shows the relationship incorrectly, I'm assuming what they mean is..the price goes up, thus the yield goes down, not the other way around? They don't give you the market interest rates.

Exhibit 4-4 is confusing to me and I don't get it.

For example for the 9% yield the intial price is the fair value, but then it says ""new price"" and puts it at 90.87, why? Why did the price decline?",finance,1427172366

personalfinance,So I'm thinking about never using a credit card.,"It's a bit ironic that I'm posting this here now, because a few months ago I was asking how to get a credit card without any existing credit history.

Since then, I applied for one of the cards that was recommended to me on that thread, and have had an awful experience with it. I'm not in debt or anything, but I was given a completely insane interest rate, and, more importantly, the card has proved to be incredibly unreliable and frustrating. It's currently got a hold on it due to an administrative error, which I can't remove without going through a huge amount of hassle. Since I barely use it, I'm thinking of just cutting my losses and swearing off credit cards.

I've heard all the arguments about how important it is to build a credit rating, but I'm not sure how much they apply to me. I hate driving and have no intention of ever owning a car, and it will probably make more sense in the long run for me to rent, rather than buy, my house. And I have no intention of racking up credit card debt to finance vacations or Christmas presents. The only reason I got the card in the first place was for emergencies, but it seems now that it will be close to useless for that, because of the poor service and unreliability.

So in summary, it seems to me like a credit card is a lot of hassle, combined with a risk of getting myself into serious debt, without any real benefit to go with it. Is my logic sound here, or am I just being impulsive and short-sighted?",finance,1427182487

  Chase - $25 min  
  Capital one - Current is $85 min.

Since we both graduated college (2009 and 2010) we've worked consistently but generally lived paycheck to paycheck, or close to. We probably could have done better saving during these past few years but I'd say in the past year we've gotten our shit together a bit better.

personalfinance,"Screw Miss Havisham, I needed to learn about interest rates","How does the education system miss something that most of us will need to deal with almost every day of our lives? How does it skip completely, or just touch on a subject that can cause great hardship and has driven people to suicide? It's not an easy subject to talk about, but not that complicated to learn, yet in school we rarely do. Most of you probably think I'm talking about sex. Sorry to disappoint, but I'm actually talking about money. 

Sex and money are both topics that a lot of people argue should be taught by parents. But are they? 

I did my own research, and asked 15 people of my own generation and 15 millennials if they learned about money from their parents. Only 3 of my generation did, and shockingly only 2 of the millennials answered that they had gained a working knowledge of money from their parents. Parents fell short on the sex subject too, but luckily most of us took sex education in school. My mother handed me a book about the biological side of sex when I was in grade 8, and while it was an eye-opener, I had already learned a lot from the school curriculum. Any gaps in my knowledge were filled by the time I got to high school by my best friend Sophie Boudreaux and Judy Bloom books. Since sex was pretty well covered, my parents should have handed me a book about interest rates. I especially needed it, because my friends and I were not naturally curious about personal finance. We were never huddled together at a sleepover, giggling over a copy of MoneySense magazine.

So since my parents didn’t do it, and the school system didn’t teach it, I graduated high school with next to no knowledge about money; how it works, why I need it or how I could get myself into a lot of trouble with it.

What did I learn in high school? I learned about Miss Havisham, the old woman in Great Expectations who was left at the alter and lived the rest of her life in her wedding dress, setting out to break men’s hearts using her adopted daughter Estella as a pawn. And that knowledge came in handy when I could only afford to eat rice for five years after university, because I had to pay off credit cards. Don’t judge, twenty two per cent interest didn’t sound so bad at the time.

I also remember that The Valley of Ashes in The Great Gatsby was supposed to resemble something dark and lifeless. Ashes stood for destruction, and the death of Myrtle Wilson symbolized the pain present in the valley. You want something dark? Try affording your first car to get to your minimum wage job, and then still owing on that car long after it’s gone. Now that’s pain. And speaking of pain, do you remember the old joke about the two things you cannot escape from in life? Death and taxes. Does anybody remember learning about taxes in school? Anything at all? Deductables, expenses, net income, anything? Nothing? Me neither.

I can remember though, in vivid detail, the passage I had to memorize and recite from Macbeth.

Come to my woman’s breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substance
You wait on nature’s mischief!

Thanks Mr. Gray for making me say woman’s breasts in front of a class of 14 year-old boys. Thanks very much for creating a fear of public speaking. And thanks Lady Macbeth, you helped me when I wanted to buy my first apartment, knowing nothing about the language of loans or mortgages. The guy at the bank looked very confused when I asked him why I needed to amortize an Asian for 25 years.

Now my ultimate point is not to criticize the literature aspect of English class or deem it obsolete. I remember it so vividly, because I loved it. I’m not referencing trigonometry, because I couldn’t even define what it is with a gun to my head. My point is not to cut out important parts of the curriculum, but to add some practical teaching about money into our school system.

A study by PNC Financial Services Group found that Millennials are in debt an average of $12,000 in their early 20s and $78,000 by their late 20s. It’s definitely time to start teaching about money management in high schools. And since studies have shown that large amounts of debt are an independent risk factor for depression and suicide, it’s critical that we do. And while a lot of this debt is from student loans, it’s definitely compounded by the fact that young people want what they want when they want it, yet know very little about how to pay for it.

When I turned 18 and went off to University, I, like many others, became a prime target for credit card companies. I had the fresh-faced, peachy glow of youth, desperately yearning to break away from my parents. And what luck, the campus had banks and credit card vendors readily available to help me on this road to becoming an adult, and what luck I got a free microwave for signing up! Five years after graduation, struggling to pay off those cards, and living in my parent’s basement, blush and a smack in the face wouldn’t bring that peachy glow back. I couldn’t continue on the path that I had planned, the path that I so desperately wanted. That debt put a stranglehold on my future and changed the course of my life, and I’ll regret it until the day I die.

So here is my simple advice for people who didn’t learn about money in school, and whose parents, like mine, didn’t teach them about personal finance. 

LEARN IT YOURSELF. 

It is never too late to take control.

There is a lot of information out there to help, and a lot of books and websites with valuable and necessary information. I’ve listed a few at the bottom. Stay in the driver’s seat of your future, and don’t let any lender or credit card company be in charge of your life. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, is worth giving up your financial freedom.

Learn terms like;

Compound interest 
Credit
Unsecured loan
Fixed rate
Adjustable rate
Assets

Because you don’t want to be forced to look up these later;

Credit bureau
Credit counseling agency
Debt negotiation

But since the rate of 20 and 30-somethings living with their parents has skyrocketed, the ball is ultimately thrown back into the parental court. Now it’s becoming later and later that young people learn how to manage their own household and their own personal finances. True, there are some who pay rent, insurance and their own cell phone bills, and are learning to manage their money. But then there are those who are not, and will be their parent’s financial responsibility until the bank of mom and dad head to the retirement home.

But what’s the problem, according to the school system, it was the parent’s responsibility to teach them about money in the first place right?

Karma's a bitch.

personalfinance,Should I buy or rent? Am I on the right track?,"Hello all,

I come to you for advice on what to do. I am currently living with family and I want to move closer to my job.  I live in SWFL where the real estate has been very rocky the past few years so I’m just so confused on whether to rent or buy.
Some background and work history:

* I am 24 years old and work in the I.T field. 
* I held an I.T position from 2010 to 2014 making $24,000 a year.
* In 2014 I was hired with a very stable position (government I.T) with a hourly rate of $15.25         ($31,720  yearly before taxes) ($1860 monthly after taxes, insurance, and pension deductions)
* As of 3/20/15 I just have just received a title change and will be earning $17.53 ( $36,472 ) (I am unsure what it will be monthly after taxes and pension &amp; insurance deductions.. I presume around ~1,100 biweekly)


Now that I have had my employment history out of the way, here is my financial situation:

* $6,200 in savings
* Car loan originally $14,000, now at $10,900 with 2.25% interest.
* Credit card with $5000 limit and 8.9% Interest rate. I have $440 charged on the card, which will be paid off this coming paycheck. 
* Zales charge card with $500 limit. No balance.
* 3 Years credit history, no late payments ever, no black marks ever.
* 757 credit score
* I claim 0 dependents on my taxes 
* Car payment of $254 a month 
* Car Insurance of $100 a month
* Cell phone of $77 a month
* Gas costs of $200 a month (56 mile round trip daily to commute)
* Rent $150 a month
* Health + Dental insurance - $20 a month 
* 3% monthly of gross salary towards Florida Retirement System Pension plan. ( ~90 a month)

There are condos near my workplace that are for sale and also for rent. The rentals go for $800 for 1b/1b and the 2b/2b go for $900 to $950.  Ideally I would like the 2 bed just so I can have a separate office for my on-call work. A co-worker who lives there claims his water bill is $50 a month and his electric is $80 to $100. 
To purchase one of these condos would cost approximately $105,000 to $120,000 for a 2/2. A 1/1 would be $80,000 to $100,000. Unfortunately this has a drawback, The hoa/condo fees are $220 to $275 a month and don’t include any utilities. The plus side is, these condos are literally within one mile of my workplace which would bring my fuel costs down significantly. 

An alternative is purchasing a home approx 5 to 10 miles from my workplace. These homes range approximately $120 to $150k. The part that intimidates me is that anything with a home can go wrong and I recognize I don’t have enough income to pad any emergency expenses such as needing a new roof or an AC unit going out.
To those who may question why I haven’t found cheaper apartments: the cheaper apartments run around $740 for a 2/2 but are further away from my workplace, causing higher fuel costs negating any savings.

As you can see I definitely need some guidance on what to do in my situation. I cannot (nor do I desire) to live with family more than through the end of this year. 

Please help!

- Purchased late September of 2013
- Purchase price: $225,000
- Original loan amount: $220,924
- Current balance: $215,093
- Interest Rate: 4.6960%

About 3 months ago, I started to receive a LOT of mail regarding my FHA mortgage. The jist is they can lower my payments by reducing my MIP, etc. I didn't know any of the companies and could tell someone of them were trying to look more official than they were, so I have been trashing them...almost 2-3 per day it seems.

Today, I get a call from my actual loan officer I worked with on my mortgage. He basically says he can get my monthly payment down and there will be zero out of pocket costs, as the closing costs would be rolled into the loan, points to cover, etc. He says it's really a no-brainer and isn't a refi, but a ""streamline"" that Obama initiated in January. He says due to a reduced MPI and my credit score jumping 100 points (715 score) since the mortgage, I can save $400 per month.

*Can someone without vested interest in me explain what is going on here and if there is anything I should be concerned about?* I asked if refinancing into a conventional loan would benefit me more and he said ""if I had equity of 20%, another $200 savings...but since you don't, this is same as going conventional.""

personalfinance,[Taxes] Filed Federal Taxes with incorrect routing number for direct deposit refund,"IMy wife and I filed our federal taxes jointly for the first time this year and are receiving a substantial refund.  However, the routing and account number I gave for the direct deposit of the return was for a bank account that was closed recently.  

I've tried calling the IRS help line at 800-829-1040 and that is just a maze of automation.  I finally spoke to a person after learning my way through the menus and they directed me to their Individual Accounts department where I was greeted with a recording to the effect of ""we're too busy to take any more calls"" and the line was then hung up.

Kind of worried all of that money will be lost in limbo.  Does anyone know how to remedy this or what the IRS will do with the refund now? Thanks. 

EDIT: I was finally able to get into the phone hold queue and speak with a representative.  She put in a request to have the direct deposit stopped and issue a check in the mail instead.  She seemed confident this would work since I filed very recently and the refund hadn't been issued yet.  I assume the actual refund machine is a large automated system separate from anything the help desk can control so when it goes to post my refund it will see this request and hopefully mail a check instead.  

EDIT2: Using the where's my refund page I was able to see that the fund transfer was returned by my bank and the IRS had mailed a check. We received the check in the mail this weekend, total time 18 days. Fast!",finance,1427214846
personalfinance,"Need advice: ""0% APR on Balance Transfers"" and Intelligently Managing CC Debt","First time posting on PF and using a throwaway since some of the info is personal. Really appreciate any advice on my situation.

I have two credit cards--a Capital One Visa at ~9% APR and another AMEX at ~12%. My credit line is $30k with Capital One and $21k with AMEX, and I have about $16k in debt on each card. However, I'm a homeowner with a good credit score and I'm not particularly worried about being able to pay these off once I sell my house in the next year or two. Just refi'd as well so not planning on having credit score pulled any time soon.

On to the question: Capital One offered a 0% APR for 12 months on Balance Transfers (with a 3% balance transfer fee). I'm tempted to take advantage of this, but not sure what the smartest thing to do is RE: total credit used on each account and the effect it will have on my credit score (and card rates). Ultimately, I'm trying to reduce the amount of interest I'm paying each month without opening myself up to other issues. Would it be smartest to:

1) continue as-is, two cards with two balances and weight paying down the higher interest rate first
2) move a small portion of my AMEX balance ($4k?) to Capital one, so they're both at a similar debt:credit ratio (~60%)
3) move near the max from my AMEX to Capital One ($10k? more?) and work on paying off the AMEX entirely
4) something else

Thanks for any advice and happy to try to answer questions below.

TL;DR - what are some good rules for taking advantage of ""0% APR for 12 months on balance transfers"" (with 3% fee) that give you maximum savings while not impinging on debt:credit ratio and my credit score?",finance,1427216761
personalfinance,Snowball vs. Avalanche---and why sometimes Avalanche is NOT the answer,"I wanted to start a separate thread on this because I feel like avalanche becomes the knee jerk recommendation of so many people on here.  And I believe this to be incredibly misguided.  

Let's just imagine a hypothetical scenario where you have one loan balance of $7,500 paying $125/month at 5% interest, and another loan balance of $60,000 paying $400/month at 7.5% interest.  And let's just imagine you have an extra $500/month to pay down your debt.  

Most people here would recommend using that extra money to pay off the higher interest loan.  I strongly disagree.  

For every $1,000 you pay towards a debt at 1% lower interest as compared to another loan, you are going to pay $10 annually in interest.  

Let me say that again.  A measly $10.  Over the course of twelve months.  As opposed to putting that $1,000 into a higher interest loan with a much larger balance.  

For every percentage point this is the difference between paying at a higher interest rate vs. a lower interest rate.  

So in the example I provided, if you put all that extra money into the smaller loan balance and lower interest rate, you would have paid off that debt in 13 months.  

So 13 months, and your fixed monthly expenses have dropped by $125/month.  And you have the reward of seeing a loan vanish.  Never underestimate what that does to motivate someone, and what it does for their psyche.  

Now let's just imagine you had put that money into the larger loan balance instead.  $6,250 is how much extra you would have paid toward the larger balance.  Which would have saved you $62.50 over the course of the year in interest.    *****EDIT---I am leaving the above text as is from the original post but I wanted to make one small correction.  $62.50 would be per percentage point, the difference between the two loans is 2.5%, so this would actually be $156.25 annually, or $13/month.  Which doesn't really change my argument or stance in any way, I just wanted to correct the math.  Surprisingly no one corrected it for me.******

But this savings is not really something you see except for on paper.  It's not really palpable.  It's just something you see on your loan statements, while you continue to pay on both loans.  And that is not too terribly rewarding IMO.  Seeing a loan vanish is incredibly rewarding.  

So in the given example, would you pay an extra $13 (edited) a month in interest in order to see your fixed monthly expenses drop by $125/month?  I would in a heartbeat.  

And yet many people on here would look at the numbers above, and give a knee jerk ""pay on the highest interest rate"" response.  

In many instances this advice is marginally helpful, and in fact will make the person making those payments miserable with no reward in sight.  You could have saved that extra $5 by skipping out on Starbucks once every thirty days. 

The bottom line is being a glutton for punishment sometimes leads to a lot of misery with a negligible reward to show for it.",finance,1427217172
personalfinance,How Does Paying Off Simple Interest Debt Defeat Investments Compounding at 7% Interest?,"I'm not really looking for an argument here, just curious as to the logic and math behind popular advice given on this subreddit. 

Posters frequently counsel OPs to pay off debt before investing. In the context of student loans, for example, people often say that paying a 7.8% loan is just like getting a 7.8% return. But these student loans accrue with simple interest.

Conversely, investments compound over time. You can earn 7% returns one year, then 7% returns on that amount next year, then 7% again, on and on, compounding on itself.

My simple brain is telling me that 7% compounding is better than paying off something at 7% simple interest. My simple brain is also telling me that this is exactly why we mortgage properties instead of buying cash: you are better off leveraging that money elsewhere because you can get a better return than the interest rate on your loan. 

I think my simple brain is likely wrong because investments don't have guaranteed returns, but I still can't wrap my head around how paying off simple interest debt is better than investing in a traditional brokerage account that enjoys compound interest, even when the loan interest rate and expected rate of return are the same.

So, can anybody on /r/personalfinance show me the math why I'm wrong? Why is it better to pay off simple interest debt rather than invest and enjoy compound interest?",finance,1427217596

personalfinance,Advice for managing/eliminating a large amount ($65k) of debt,"In the past 3 years I've gotten divorced from my first wife, re-married and became a father to two boys (twins), in addition to my daughter from my first marriage.  The divorce was an 18 month process in which I had to essentially support two households.  The majority of my expenses (rent, food, etc.) went on credit cards and piled up quickly.  One of my sons had some medical problems early on, which tacked medical bills on top of the credit card debt.

Last year I managed to pay off my wife's existing debt ($30k and we settled for $17k), my auto loan ($5k) and the majority of the outstanding medical bills ($4k).  This was great progress, but I have a ways to go.  I'm looking for some advice on how to tackle the rest of the debt which is mainly credit cards.

I'm currently looking at around $65k in credit card debt. I also owe around $7k in state and federal taxes from my side income last year.  I currently have around $30k in checking and savings accounts.

**Income**  

* I net around $6,800/month from my full time salary  
* Side income is unpredictable - last year I averaged around $3,500/month, so far this year it's around $1,500/month.  The year before it was about the same.

**Bills**  

* My house payment is $1,570/month (principal + interest + taxes + insurance + PMI + HOA).  I just refinanced it last week knocking $100 off of the payment   
* Child support is $1,100/month  
* Alimony is $800/month  
* Credit card minimums are currently coming in around $1,500/month  
* Car + life insurance is $190/month  
* Student loan is $135/month  
* Electric is around $200/month  
* Miscellaneous items like trash, water, sewer, internet are around $100/month

So the monthly minimum amount going out in bills is $5,600, leaving me with around $1,200/month for food, gas, diapers and anything else.  I'm consistently going over that amount every month by at least $800, dipping into my savings to cover it.  My last alimony payment is this October, so that will add $800/month back.  However my sons will be hitting pre-school age at that time so it will most likely just be re-allocated there.

I've been considering going through Prosper or similar P2P lending for a loan to consolidate some of the credit card debt and hopefully save a couple hundred dollars a month.

personalfinance,Is it ever preferable to keep a voluntary expense for the write-off it provides on your taxes?,"Certain things you spend money on throughout the year can be written off from your taxes. That is, the amount of the expense can deducted from your income as if you never earned it, thus paying less in taxes. Common ones include mortgage interest, business mileage, or charitable donations. That's fantastic for things that you need or want to spend money on.

However, I've had a few friends brag to me lately about how they did XYZ just because it's a huge write off. For instance, one friend installed a new floor in his rental when it was completely unnecessary. This question is coming up now because today my tax accountant told me to not pay down the mortgage to get rid of PMI because it's a write off. This makes me think there's some other benefit I'm not seeing? 

Lets do the math. Lets assume you pay 30% in overall taxes (state and federal). That means writing off a $1,000 expense will reduce your income by $1,000. At 30%, you will save $300 by doing that. If you never paid the $1,000 expense, then that increases your income by $1,000. You have to pay $300 in taxes, but keep the other $700 in your pocket. So to me, the $300 you save in taxes in the first instance is never worth it if you can keep the $700 from the second instance. Right? Right guys? Am I crazy?",finance,1427222205

**VIEWPOINT:**

* South Australia's nuclear vision

Quickly following the state government's announcement of a Royal Commission to look at nuclear energy prospects for South Australia, an opposition senator has launched his feisty vision for the future. If implemented, it would see the state make a technological leap to put it in front of the rest of the world in sustainability, write Ian Hore-Lacy and Ben Heard.

Senator Sean Edwards proposes ""that SA stakes its claim in the global nuclear fuel recycling industry."" It would mean utilising some of the world's used fuel from present reactors to fuel fast reactors, via an electrometallurgical reprocessing plant. The whole venture would be supported by relieving overseas governments of their used fuel. South Australia would be paid to take this, and would use it to fuel next-generation reactors for power production. Apart from such recycling, that used fuel is effectively high-level waste and its latent value is squandered.

Depending on the scope of South Australia's involvement, said Edwards, there is a real possibility for ""the generation of revenues that could supplant the $4.4 billion in state taxes"" paid to the state government every year. ""Polling proves South Australians want this and they want it yesterday. By virtue of Labor's Royal Commission there is now for the first time a bipartisan sentiment attached to the nuclear issue, opening an unprecedented opportunity.""

So my Stepfathers accountant said that this is the last year that they can claim me on their tax return for the $3900 tax credit. I made a deal with them that they will give me the return I would have received. 

here are some details
I worked two jobs last year and made just under 10k
I'm a fulltime student in washington state. I would have been able to claim the american opportunity tax credit for an additional 1000 on the return.

personalfinance,Need to return Signing Bonus. Former employer wants more back than they gave me.,"So here's the situation. 

I started working for a company in August of 2014 and I received a $5,000 signing bonus. After taxes I received ~$3,300. The stipulation was that I needed to stay 12 months or I had to return it.

I left this company in February of 2015. 

I had fully planned to pay back the ~$3,300 that I was given, but I received an email asking for all $5,000 back. 

After going back and forth over several weeks (They take forever to email back) I was sent this:

&gt;Please be informed that as per IRS guidelines once a calendar year has passed you must settle overpayments as a gross payment.  You may be able to claim the repayment on your current year tax returns, you should consult your accountant for further details.
 
&gt;Please arrange to send a check for $ 5000 to repay this bonus. The check should be made out to ""__________"" and please send it to the following address and confirm upon dispatch.

I have attempted to ask if I would receive an updated W2 for 2014 or if this $5,000 dollars would be taken out of my gross income for 2015, but have been ignored. Also, my definition of a calendar year is 12 months, not just a new year. So it's a tad confusing. 

I was given my last paycheck and paid for my unused vacation days. I have googled this and can't find a situation that seems to match. Others that have posted have had their last paychecks taken out of or withheld and have many other issues associated with it. I've gotten a lot of ""I think"" and ""maybe"". I'm just looking for something solid to go off of.

Any help is appreciated!

Thanks

Edit: It occurred to me I never asked a direct question.
Do I owe them all $5,000 dollars? 
If I do, a point in the right direction would be helpful on how to get the money that would be owed back to me by the federal government. I would assume that I would get a break on my taxes in 2015.

Edit 2: I wanted to point out that I'm aware I was *given* $5,000, not ~$3,300. I was trying to figure out if I should be the one to settle up with the IRS or them. And it appears it's me! I doubt anyone else will comment on this thread so I would like to thank the two people who commented with helpful answers. I appreciate it. 

Edit 3: I got the problem solved. Just wanted to make an edit so if anyone else with the same situation comes across this post they'll know what to expect. I was told by an accountant that my former company will lower my earned income for 2015 by the $5,000 but will leave the federal withholding the same, and the IRS will adjust what I owe/get refunded based on that. 

Thanks again to all who posted suggestions.",finance,1427244034

 $1500 Looking for the AUTHENTIC Wall Street Summer Experience (Financial District)
Looking for an apartment within a 4.5 mile radius of Wall Street. My summer internship at an elite bank and starts in late May. Don't worry about rent because you know I'm getting PAID. Must be close to Wall Street. Must be close to nightlife. I fucking tear shit up, and expect those living with me to do the same. I create systems of ALPHA-LIVING, a term I coined myself. Here is what that means: 


Preferred Lifestyle: Let me just dive right into it: I work harder than everyone else, and play even harder than I work. And when I say I work hard, I mean I fucking crunch numbers until my NOSE BLEEDS. The harder I work though, the more turned up I get. My endeavors include but are not limited to: lifting weights (home gym is non-negotiable), being woken up by natural sunlight ( this means I need the bedroom facing east), watching anything on Bravo (cable or I'm out), and an in-apartment sauna and/or steam shower (Sauna MUST have some type of audio capabilities). My Russian friend taught me that business gets done there over a good steam. Release the toxins and get ready to rock this city, that's what we're going to do. Speaking of toxins, I rage. I rage hard. Have you ever heard of something called ""the dragon fucking the goat""? Don't even bother looking it up--I'll show you. Those living with me have to expect two things and two things only: 1. If you bring over hot pussy, I'M GOING TO FUCK IT. I don't care if it's your girlfriend or your grandma. Bottom line: we live in a FREE COUNTRY and I use my dick when and how I want (non-negotiable) 2. I only do bottle service. If you're throwing a party, I don't even care if its a Tuesday night, there has to be bottles and models. Swedish Vaska is welcomed and non-negotiable. 

Preferred Roommates: Male preferred but open to females if they understand that things will likely get sexual EXTREMELY QUICKLY and that is entirely out of my control. Roommates must come from a top-tiered Ivy, and be able to pull 2-3 females on a given night (without prior warning) . If you can recite the Dow Jones 30 in order of market cap, we're cool. If you know what LIBOR was today, we're cool. If you don't know what I'm talking about, I suggest you GET A LIFE because that level of knowledge is non-negotiable from my end. I fucking breed greatness and expect something a bit under that from those in my living vicinity ( non-negotiable). This may come as something of a surprise, but I also enjoy doing puzzles. I hope you're into that too cuz I've got some great ones I can bring. Another thing, I DON'T FUCKING SHARE MY WSJ WITH PEOPLE. In college some douche stole it from my steps every morning and I better not see you anywhere near it. And don't ask me for my subscription passwords. I won't share them because I pay for that shit so I can be better than you, not so we can hold hands and skip through a fucking meadow while we read it together. You should know The Game already so don't bother asking me. If you believe anything other than Capitalism, GTFO. Seriously. (Only exceptions is playing Drake's ""Started from the Bottom.""...but sparingly. If you didn't laugh at that, GTFO) On that note, rap to chill and DUBSTEP FOR PARTYING. If you play anything else I'm going to smash whatever stereo or pussy IPOD DOCK you have ( I don't give two fucks whether its got warranty or not.)


Preferred recreational activities: It should be obvious by now that I work out and that I get huge while I do it. If you are upset by any noises I make while I throw weight up, then buy earplugs. By the way, If I need a spotter, I don't give a fuck who's sleeping...someone is GOING TO SPOT. The last rep is what separates the pussies from the alphas. I also read a lot, but never fiction (if it's not real, then why would you ever read it? It's just something that someone made up in their mind? Holy fuck that's useless). If I see some hipster bullshit like Kurt Vonnegut sitting around I will literally shit in your PILLOW CASE. Don't even tell me you fucking visited the Upper West Side. I go through 2 cases of Montecristo No 2. (straight from the fucking island--UPS requires a fucking signature, so if you're home just do it. ) every week. If you smoke my Cubans, then you'll either pay me cash ( with minimum 10% interest + risk premium which is non-negotiable) on the spot or we're going to have a big problem. I don't lift weights to look pretty, I do it to protect my fucking shit so expect that I will smash your face if you touch my stuff including CUBANs. My alcohol policy is simple: Johnny Walker Red Label. You bring that black label shit and you're GTFO. 

As you can see, for the most part I'm a pretty laid back guy. I will be chill if you are chill but that means following my rules which I've laid out here and AREN'T COMPLICATED. If you got rules of your own feel free to send them to me, although that shit will probably go directly to my SPAM folder ( it's not that I don't have respect for your rules, but they're not as good as mine because these are tried and true and my system works and is therefore non-negotiable).

Those interests should include: LinkedIn profiles, a minimum of one story about your wildest fucking night in college ( USE REAL NAMES), and a picture of the hottest chick you've gotten with (NON-NEGOTIABLE and tits are a major PLUS). I will provide the same but only if I approve of yours so they had better be good and photoshopping WILL BE SNIFFED OUT (this is not some weird pervy thing but just to make sure you're as serious about this as I am).

By the end of the summer, everyone will fucking know who we are (non-negotiable).

    do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers

personalfinance,"At the risk of sounding incredibly ignorant, why should I care about credit scores?","It's my understanding that the whole point is to convince some agency that we will pay back loans to make a big purchase.  Ok, so how do we do it?  

Credit card interest rates are relatively high (relative to the depreciation of our currency), and it's prudent to always pay them off 100% each month to avoid this pointless fee.  Why not pay with cash in the first place?  They tell you it's the perks like ""Cash back"" and improving credit ratings.  Why do we get cash back?  Because credit card companies can afford to by charging merchants a percent of all sales through their credit card.  Merchants raise the price of their product to compensate for that, so the ""cash back"" perk is often what you would have paid from the start without the credit card. You will see this directly stated with smaller businesses who tack on a surcharge for credit card purchases.  The cash price is the real price.  So I'm ""encouraged"" to ""earn"" money on a purchase by using a method of payment that increases the cost of the product to fund the very perk I'm seeking?  I see how it's self perpetuating and successful from a business standpoint, but I think it's fundamentally flawed.

What are the 2 loans that people use for their credit ratings?  Houses and cars.  Car value depreciates laughably fast, whether it's a used vehicle or new.  A huge portion of people build zero equity on their car and a portion even owe on their car if they decide to sell it at any point before the loan is paid back.

Same goes for housing.  Home values are highly speculative and variable, yet we have banking institutions offering *thirty year* mortgages to buy them.  If anyone seriously considered this loan to be fulfilled, it implies the lender thinks the home owner will have their job/career for 30 years.  The other reason I hear is tax incentive, which isn't a real *market* reason.  It's just a collective of people petitioning their government for relief from this perpetuated system of extended loans for houses.

In the end, I don't really care about my credit score.  I don't want to ""owe"" a 30 year lifetime promise to a house that could swing in value the a point that says I should just *walk away* from the shitty loan a few years down the road and just rent instead.  I don't get it.",finance,1427271124

I graduated from University last May, and got a job in a nearby city making okay money. The industry I am in has semi-volatile hours, so I can bring home anywhere from 2000$ - 3000$ a month, depending on the work load. So for planning purposes, let's assume the low end. Anything I make over that will be added to what you all suggest.

 So here is where I'm not sure what to do. I have about 30k$ in student loan debt (5% Interest), 5k$ left on my car loan, and between everything on my budget after every month, I have about 500$ (from the minimum) left over. Also, might help to mention that I live in a very low cost of living area of the US. I would like to buy a house in the next couple of years as opposed to renting, but I'm not sure I want to take on more debt just yet, but still would like to take advantage of how low interest rates are in this buyer's market. I will be able to rent out a room or two to some acquaintances of mine to add some extra income as well, which is making it even more enticing. I would like to buy an older house, put some sweat equity into it, live in it for a few years, and hopefully the market will be back up in the next ten years so I can sell it, but if not, I will just rent it out if/when I move into a different house.

So my question is: do I crank all of my money in to paying down my debt and wait to invest in a house? Or do I keep paying the minimums on my loans and save up for a down payment on a house. Or, is there a third and better option I might not be thinking of?",finance,1427279060

Quit my previous dead-end government job for a brighter future, but also substantial study debt owed to state. So I financed a cheap but reliable car because I needed it and recently found out my state pension is paying out into my bank account, which is a great deal more than I was expecting. Here's a breakdown. Take note I live outside the US and our prime interest rate currently is 9.5%, 1 USD equals 11.9 ZAR.

* Car debt = R99,550 with a linked-to-prime interest rate of 17%
* My pension payout will be R153,000

The question is: do I pay off the car and sink the rest into the study debt because the car's interest rate is that much higher, or do I push everything into the study debt because the total is higher?

I think I'm doing pretty well, but he sets a pretty high bar to meet.  Also, I generally like my career, so I don't mind too much if I end up working for money until about age 50 (after that, all bets are off).  I just kind of wanted to give you guys some insights into my current situation and see if you had any advice, or think that I'm wildly off-track.  This is my wife and mine's shared strategy:

Current ages:  29 &amp; 28.  We also currently have 1 young child, plan to have more (but not for a couple years).  We pay my MIL to watch our kid while we work, and use an FSA to save on taxes from that.  It costs about the same as a daycare, but it's family and means less time getting ready in the morning and hopefully fewer random illnesses.

Combined pre-tax income:  ~$145k.  It's grown from about $90k when we were first married a few years ago, and we expect it to grow to roughly $200k by 2020.  It's harder to predict what happens after that, but I generally expect salary growth will slow down over time.  Not included is that my sister-in-law lives with us and pays us rent, totaling about $5k/year.

**Assets:**

Cash/emergency fund:  $35k.  Considering growing this to $45k within the next year or so since we have a growing family.

401ks/IRAs/etc:  ~$165k.  Split between my wife and mine's 401ks/Roth 401k's, Roth IRA's, and an old HSA.

Vehicles:  $42k KBB of three cars.  I know, I know, it's wasteful, and we should sell one of them.  It's just a matter of choosing to get rid of my beloved 8 year old Miata (now that we have a kid), but it's hard to part with.

Home:  Purchased 3 years ago for ~$370k.  Current Zestimate is $520k, which may or may not be accurate.  We likely got lucky and chanced into a historically good time to buy a house.

**Debts:**

Car Loan:  $16k at 1.75% on one of the vehicles.  Car loans are generally stupid, but prior to having the kid, both of our vehicles either didn't have backseats or never had A/C.  But we are paying about double towards this and the interest rate is extremely low, so I don't feel too bad about it.

Mortgage:  $312k at 3.125%.  It's a long-term loan at approximately the rate of inflation on an appreciating asset.  No plans to accelerate payments on this.

**Net worth:**  

~$434k if you believe Zillow, or ~$282k at the extreme conservative end if you assume no appreciation in home values since 2012.  Truth is somewhere between those two values, I think.

**Current plans going forward:**

Continue maxing out my wife and mine's Roth IRAs.  My work's 401k has extremely low cost options (0.03%), so we're currently contributing $12k/year towards that and plan to max it out within the next few years.  My wife's 401k options aren't great with the lowest ER's around 0.6%; we currently contribute 10% of her pay, but will work on increasing that once mine is maxed out.  We plan to contribute about $3k per year per kid in 529s for eventual college expenses, since we know financial aid will likely be very limited for them because of our income.

Eventually, I know we need to look into taxable investments outside of the tax sheltered accounts if we want to retire by 50.  I know there are methods, like 72t distributions, to get money out prior to normal retirement ages, although I'd like insights from people using that method on how much of a hassle it is.

economy,Can someone explain how/why a country with control over their currency printing press could ever be stuck in a deflationary spiral (such as Japan over the last 20 years),"My only theory is that negative interest rates would somehow be less desirable than deflation... but as Japan as shown, deflation is a major problem too. Another way to ask this question - why doesn't the U.S. start physically printing many more bills to get inflation to the Fed's target rate of 2% to 3%, instead of being below that range for the past 5 years? It seems like any country with 100% national debt to GDP should have inventive to error on the high side of a target inflation range, especially the U.S. who arguably has lower stability risk than any other currency.

personalfinance,Question about cashing EE UST Bonds without a physical bank.,"Hi guys, first I'd like to say that I love this sub. I've learned so much over the last few years here. Truly a great community.

Down to it- I've got a batch of EE Bonds from when I was a baby. Many earn 4% but a handful earn around 1% and represent an overage to the projected bond allocation in my personal portfolio. All of these ~1% bonds total about $1500 and are fully matured. I want to cash them out and reallocate these funds, but I do not have a place to do it at. I bank through two credit unions (mar fed and usaa) and with CSB for my travel fund. None of these instituions have physical locations and the shared branches say they cannot redeem my bonds. The UST says my bonds need to be notorized by a representative from my bank IOT redeem by mail through their PO Box, but since I have no bank to *go to* I have no clerk to *sign*.

Any suggestions on what I can do? Will a commercial bank that I am not a customer of redeem these bonds for me? Will they charge a fee?",finance,1427292009
personalfinance,"Planning Advice: 22 Years Old, 80k+ Salary, 29k Loans, ~17k Checking.","Hey! So over the past several weeks I’ve been compiling my own spreadsheet and attempting to budget for the future and I wanted PFs advice/opinions. At the start of June I’ll be moving to another state for a new job. My base salary is **$80,000**, followed by a 6.5K signing bonus, and with my quarterly bonuses I’ll probably be closer to ~90+ as my base. But to be as safe and responsible as possible all my planning and calculations are based solely off $80k.

So first off for moving, rent deposits, car down payments, and all of that I suppose I’ll just be paying it straight out of my checking account so I am not terribly concerned.

I’ll be paid Bi-monthly at what I approximate is **$2,275** take home (**$4,550** monthly). I took my Gross and subtracted Federal Income Tax, Social Security Tax, Medicare Tax, and Insurance costs. (I have not taken out 401k contributions which I probably should, my employer does 50% matching up to 6%, but I wasn’t sure how best to calculate this monthly)

I broke down costs next. I am hoping to find an apartment with a rent of **~1100**. I thought this was reasonable because **30%** of my take home is **1365** and I am below that (leaves room for utilities). Assuming Cable + Cell Phone is **~110**. My employer feeds me breakfast and lunch, but to be safe I said **$400** for food. I currently have 29k in loans with varying rates but I calculated my monthly payment as **~310** (I plan to pay more but this is the minimum). 

Lastly would be my car payment. I plan to buy something when I get down there, most likely new because I don’t have nearly any time before I move down and start my job and I need a car. I don’t have time to shop used and wait around for the perfect find. At **15%** of my take home I could afford **$682** for a car (I assume this number is for car + insurance). I figured if I had a 200-300 car payment, the rest covers gas and insurance? I have literally no idea what insurance will cost me…

I am moving to a state with no income tax, I’ve got a good credit score, I just want peoples opinions if I am budgeting properly / on the right track. I am trying to put my best foot forward and be financially responsible when I move to begin my life. I do plan to contribute to my 401k as well, and I’d love to invest my excess monthly into paying off my student loans faster and investing into something else that will make money. I also plan to build my emergency fund ASAP.

**One side thing I don’t understand though, is my contract puts my gross at 3,333.33/Bi-monthly, but when I use online calculators it says my gross is 3,076. Is this because it takes out SS/Medicare but not federal income?

Thanks a lot, I sincerely appreciate any and all advice.


Edit: Assuming my monthly bills (on the high end) are 2520 per month. That leaves me with an extra 2030. How much of that do I put towards student loans, how much towards emergency fund, how much towards paying the car off faster. This is another hard question, I know I should pay off the loans first and start building the emergency fund, but how much do I leave to just exist.",finance,1427294377

I'm 26 with a good job making close to 100k. I have 4% going into my 401k which is matched with 3.5% from my employer. I then have 5k a year put into a dependent flex spending account as I have to pay 242 every 2 weeks for day care for 1 child. That and insurance is most of my pre tax items. And about 13k owed on a car. 

I live with my fiancé who has a good job as well but not as good as mine. She though has no student debt or credit cards only owes on her car to what I do. 

While I know this isn't as specific as you might need I wanted to see if there are any recommendations people here have to start dealing with the debt. 

To put it simply I can't afford the 3k a month for 10 years to pay it off with in that time. Interest rates are 6.4% or higher and interest alone is able 1.6k a month. Currently my plan was to just pay the minimum on the pay as you earn and try maxing out pre tax items like my 401k to reduce my monthly student loan bill them have it forgiven after 25 years and be hit with a huge tax bill. To pay the tax bill my plan was to buy a house in the next few years and just throw as much money into it as I can to then take an equity loan out on it to pay the tax bill.

I have a lender offering me a Conventional 20 year fixed loan at 3.875%.  Based on the newly appraised value, we would easily be past 80% LTV and would have no PMI, saving us $177 a month on the spot.  The difference in payment from a cash flow perspective is minimal (+$60 or so).

* Current interest rate 4.250%
* We're currently paying Mortgage Insurance

We're thinking that taking some action to eliminate PMI is a good use of additional funds - is that a good assumption?

* Pay down loan by $22K to get below 78% of the original loan amount
* Take advantage of lower interest rates (3.125%) and the fact that the house has gone up in value to refinance.

We're leaning towards the refinancing options, as it would allow us to have a shorter loan (15-year fixed conventional) with similar payments due to the lower interest rate and eliminating PMI. Is that a good idea?

If we decide to refinance, the issue is that I'll receive a stock vest from work in September that would allow us to put an additional $10-20K down towards the house. Is that a good use of the money?

So I'm currently trying to figure out what my next steps are. If I should request a buyout offer and put my car up for sale privately? Request carmax to give me an offer on the car? Wait and try to refinance the car? I'm currently okay paying the monthly payment. Monthly payment is $425 and I have few other bills and make about 30K yearly. I still need to fix this foolish decision. 

The loan is with carmax auto financing.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I need all the help I can get.

Thanks.",finance,1427315940
personalfinance,I owe roughly $2500 in credit card debt from my tuition from my college. I would like to pay these off asap because the apr is awful.,"I was forced by my grandparents (who are stuck in the 1800s and believe that credit cards are the cheapest way for my school bills) to put my $2500 tuition fee on my credit cards. It is about %25apr and I am already drowning in other school fees.

I am asking for financial pros or anyone with advice, should I apply for a student loan through the government, through a federal credit union, or a bank, or just leave the money there and suffer the apr?

The student one from the government has a %5 interest rate I believe, but would they allow me to use this money to pay the credit cards off?

And yes, I am being completely controlled by my ignorant grandparents. I am 20(f) and don't want to ruin my credit this young. Please, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1427316194

personalfinance,"HELP - 25m with 35k+ salary, $4,000 debt + SO and Newborn","So here’s my situation.. 25/m/cali with a SO, newborn, and some debt. Looking for suggestions on how I should approach resolving my issues.


**Monthly Net Income**

Mine: $2000+ (Take home rounded down to leave us some cushion, also not including 
commission)

SO: $1750 (rounded down)

Combined: $3750


My Savings: $1250

Her “Savings”: $6k from tax refund


**My CC Debt:**

Capital One - 22.9% APR - $1200 balance

Wells Fargo - 18.15% APR - $500 balance

My Tax Debt: ~2.5k from 2012 (rounding up after calculated interest)


Sigh.. I worked “exempt” for a year in 2012 due to a financial crisis, and owed roughly $2000 in taxes for the year. I haven’t file taxes since, due to financial instability (I know, I’m a horrible person) but plan on filing this weekend. I have worked full time since 2012 claiming “0”, so more taxes have been deducted from my checks and I have not filed or received a refund since 2011. I’m assuming once I file for years 2012 – present, I will have paid more into taxes than what I owed from 2012 including the 5% annual interest rate increase per year (to my knowledge cannot exceed 5 years of 25% interest). I’ve been at my current position for nearly 2 years, and I make 35k salary + commission (which is taxed 40%). So I’ve paid a shit ton in taxes.. I made roughly 6-7k in commission in a 3 month period last year, probably close to 10k in commission for the entire year, so hopefully that highly taxed commission will help me in the long run.


**Expenses**

* Rent: $1400/mo (2br in Orange County, CA. Lease up in August)

* Daycare: $500/mo

* CC Debt: $100/mo ($65 with min payment)

* Utilities: $100/mo

* Cable/Internet: $100/mo

* My Car Payment: $100/mo

* My Insurance: $145/mo (full coverage with a DUI)

* Her Car: $350/mo (Will be paid off at the end of April)

* Her Insurance: $150/mo (full coverage with a DUI)

* Gas: ~$400/mo

* Food: ~$400/mo 

* Formula/Diapers: ~$150/mo

* Phone Bill: $100/mo

**Total Monthly Expenses:** $4,000/mo..


Yes, I’m aware I’ve indicated that we’re bringing home less than what we’re spending. Her car will be paid off in about a month, leaving us $350/mo breathing room. That will put our monthly expenses around $3,650 with an absolute minimum take home of $3750 (closer to $4000+, but better to underestimate than overestimate in my opinion)


We recently had a baby (5 months old now), and had to start paying for daycare in January (ouch). Previously, I had around 8k saved but had to get an apartment ($3k first/last as deposit), and had to cover the bills while my SO was on maternity leave. After last month, I’m down to $1250 savings (again.. ouch), but she just received her tax return which was $6500 (She claimed head of household and our daughter, see above tax issue for reasoning).


*I’ve been periodically conducting research via these forums, as I was born into poverty and was never taught a damn thing about financial responsibility. So here’s what I know or have learned through these forums so far:*


1.) Don’t f*** with the taxman.. Once I get my issue resolved this year, I will NEVER let this happen again. Ever.

2.) Maximize contribution to 401k with employer matching

3.) Save an “emergency fund” of 3-6 months expenses

4.) Pay off debt via the avalanche method (highest interest rate first)

5.) Do NOT finance a car that costs half your salary

6.) Don’t eat out (work in progress)



If anyone has any suggestions for me, I welcome them with open arms. Obviously the “don’t drink and drive, wrap your tool, etc” kind of comments are common since (which since I’ve learned), but I’m looking for more constructive advise. I know I should be saving for an emergency fund again first, but I almost feel I would be better off just paying this debt and then saving.. I’m not in substantial student loan debt, so I think it’s reasonable to pay the debt first then save - but I could be completely wrong. Thanks in advance for any positive feedback, I will provide an update on my taxes once I file this weekend.

personalfinance,Using mortgage from USA to invest in AUS,"Hi All,

I'm a dual citizen between US and AUS, and basically my question is this.

As the exchange rate from USD to AUD is quite favourable, is it possible to obtain a mortgage from a US bank with a super low interest rate to purchase a property in AUS where I currently live where property is generally expensive and interest rates aren't that great? 

Some things about the situation. I grew up in the US, but now I live in Australia. I currently have active bank accounts in the US with a credit union. My credit score is also 810. Rents are outrageously expensive where I live (Sydney) as I pay $2600AUD/month for a one bedroom.

I've been googling a bit, but I'm more after first hand experience, or inside advice rather then generic articles about it. Or maybe even a guide that has requirements and steps in the process.",finance,1427318491

personalfinance,Should I put money into a 401(k) or towards my student loan debts?,"I know rule of thumb is to get rid of debts first, but I'm on the 10 year plan for my student loans. At 31 I can't put off planning for my retirement much longer. So how do I balance the two?

My student loan has a 6.8% interest rate, so if I could pay it off sooner I would rather do that. If I increased what I pay towards that by what I would contribute to my retirement, I could pay off my student loan in 5 or 6 years. Should I do that and not start saving until then? Or make it pay off in 7 years and contribute a very small amount to retirement? Or just stick with paying it off in 10 years and contribute more to retirement, though it will still be less than I know I should be.

personalfinance,Save Money Fast - 15 Proven Ways How To Save Money Fast,"We have all asked the question and wanted to now how to save money fast. Because most of the time all we hear is it takes years to save money, or I don’t have enough extra money to save right now. Most of the “how to save money” questions I get are about how to start an emergency fund, or how to save money to pay off debt quickly.

Below I have put together 15 PROVEN ways on how to save money fast. I say proven because they are not hype or fake scams like most. Some can even help you make money in 24 hrs and others will help reduce your spending. Either way they will help you free up extra money and allow you to save money fast.

Before we get started. Remember. The ways I show you are how to save money fast. This means you will have extra money. This money is for saving...not spending. So you will have to allocate this money to go into a savings account or investment fund of some type depending on your financial goals.

15 Ways How To Save Money Fast Starting NOW!
1. Work More
Now I never said all these ideas were ideal. But they get the job done. The first would be to work more hours or to work overtime. I realize this option is not available to all of you. But if it is, this is one quick and easy way to make extra money as soon as your next paycheck. Remember. Continue to live your life compared to your normal paycheck and put the additional money in the bank to start saving!

2. Get A Second Job
If you can’t get overtime like we mentioned above or you have maxed out your total hours. You can look for a second income. Now as you can probably imagine this can get very stressful and if you have a family will limit your time at home. But if the goals are discovering how to save money fast then this is a great option for the short term.

Places like temp agency’s can get you up and running part time fairly quickly. Also, check out the part time section on Craigslist. New jobs are posted on there every day. It’s also a great place to find labor jobs such as construction and lawn care on the side.

3. Eat At Home
If you typically eat out 2-3 times a week, try cutting it down to just once or try to eliminate it for a full month. This is a very effective way on how to save money fast. But I’m not just talking about restaurants. Consider this to be effective for gas stations, coffee shops, vending machines and convenience stores. Yes, this can take some planning to make sure you always have food prepped with you. But in the long run buying in bulk and from the grocery will put extra money back in your pocket every week!


Buying in bulk and from the grocery will put extra money back in your pocket every week!

4. Take Your Lunch To Work
If you eat out for lunch each day at work just try adding up all the receipts if you don’t already. Those $5 – $15 bills add up fast. And that’s not factoring in gas to drive there and back for most. A quick and easy way to help take your lunch to work is to make extra the night before and take leftovers. You can make this healthy and save money fast at the same time.

 5. Find Yourself A Roommate
Agreed this can be considered a more permanent way to save money fast but it is quick and very rewarding. Not only can you split the rent but you can split utilities and other renting expenses. Yes, you have to give up some privacy but what you loose in space and privacy you make up for in savings $$!

Of course, make sure you do all the right background checks and do your due diligence in finding the right roommate who is in this for the long run.

For the real adventurous you should check out Air BNB. With Air BNB you can rent out a room or even your couch in your house for people traveling through town or working the area. It’s a fun experience and you can meet some really cool people and make fast money doing it!

6. Reduce Or Cancel Your Cable Bill
Desperate times can call for desperate measures. Chances are your cable bill can range from $50 -$150. So a fast way to save money may be to cancel your cable bill… Just think, all that extra time you have can be used to work the extra job!

Nowadays there are many ways to still get your entertaining pleasure for a great price. You can just use Redbox or Netflix, get yourself an HD antenna or make a one-time small purchase of an Apple TV and get it all in one package.

In most cases you won’t want to eliminate all luxuries or if you have kids, you will be creating more headaches than it’s worth ( I know, I have 3!) So look at your package and see if you can remove any channels, or in some cases simply call your provider and ask. You will be surprised what they will/can do.

7. Shop around for Insurance and Lowering Prices
Be it life, car or house. Insurance can zap a lot of your hard earned cash each month. If you want to find how to save money fast shop around for different insurance quotes. You need to make sure you are getting the best rates you can otherwise you are spending unnecessary money for the same coverage

It can take some time but can result in saving up to hundreds per month. Never believe you are getting the best insurance price. So get a list of all the companies you have insurance through and call. Maybe see if you can bundle them together to get a one-time price and deal. Don’t take the first price that sounds good. Call around and prove you are getting the best insurance deal.

8. Review and Cancel All Recurring Payments
They can be small and sneaky and happen without you knowing…Or you know about them and procrastinating each month about canceling them and never do! Check your checking and credit card accounts and look out for all your recurring payments for memberships and subscriptions. This can be for the gym, Netflix, magazines, online software, and other online services. If you don’t use them, or could live without. Cancel them now! Again this method can have you save money fast!

9. Reduce Banking Interest Rates
Areas you can do this would be credit cards, cars loans,  and your home mortgage. Yes, your car and home mortgage may take refinancing and that brings along another list of considerations. But if we look at credit cards this can be one way to save money fast!

First off, keep it simple and just call the credit card company and ask them to lower your interest rate. If they say no, ask why, say thank you and hang up.

In this case, persistence pays off. So right away call back and speak to a different customer service rep and ask again.

If for whatever reason they really can’t and they won’t tell you why. It may be best to consider and 0% transfer balance. This will be a great move if you are trying to get rid of debt as you will remove the interest aspect of it.

But be warned! You are not to keep spending on these cards as now you will have two cards and a higher credit limit. So DON’T go racking up more credit!

Also, if you’re credit isn’t that strong, do some research first on the best card to help reducing the risk of an unnecessary hard inquiry on your credit. but thing 650 and above and you should be fine.

10. Sell Stuff Online
One mans junk is another mans treasure and we all have junk around our houses that is getting in the way or filling up a closet when someone out there will happily exchange it for cash with you!

Take half the day to go thourgh your house and set aside all the stuff you’d like to sell. Never think nobody will want it…You will be VERY surprised what you can sell on sites like Craigslist.

Next work out how you want to sell it:

- Craiglist
- Ebay
- Garage Sale

Craiglist can take some time taking all the pictures and uploading online, but you can reach a much wider audience and generally get better prices to help you get and save money fast.

Also, when people do come to visit, upsell them to your other stuff, Show them what else you have for sale and try and bundle together some group purchases.

Before you list anything make sure you know the true value of what you have for sale. Mark it up just a bit and always now what you are willing to take on the low end if people start to negotiate with you. Have fun, just don’t get taken advantage of!

11. Cut Back On Bad Habits
No matter what it is, cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs. They can all rack up huge bills each month. Now I’m no counselor but if you want to now how to save money fast,  kick a bad habit and get more healthy all at the same time. This will do it and help you save hundreds a month!

12. Buy Generic Labels Instead of Brands
This works for everything from clothes to food. But especially when you are trying to save money fast. Shopping store brands can save you $20-$40 bucks each week at the grocery. I wrote a whole post on how to save money at the grocery store that will help you. I realize in some cases taste may prevent you from shifting from your favorite brand of cereal, but give it a try and you will be surprised the money you can keep in your pocket to help save money fast.

13. Implement The 10 Second Rule!
It’s simple and effective and cures all impulse and conditioned purchases no matter where you are. Whenever you pick up an item in the store that wasn’t on your planned list. Stop and think about it for 10 seconds as to why you really need it, and could you really do without it this month since you are trying to save money fast

If you can’t think of a good reason, then put it back and keep the money! It really is that simple. Try it, you’ll be surprised!

14. Track Your Spending
The best way to do this is use a budget. I realize we are not all wired to be able to do this effectively where some of us obsess over it. The goal is to get you 100% aware of what all your money is doing.

Such as where it’s coming from and where’s it’s being spent. Monitoring for as short as one week can highlight a number of holes you can start to plug with conscious spending.

Online tools such as Mint.com and YNAB.com are 2 of my favorites. Mint.com allows you to link your accounts and easily make budgets so it really is a no-brainer once it is set up.

YNAB.com requires a little bit more work weekly, but educates you in a whole new level and helps you get ahead of your finances and really get in control. Try each one and see which you prefer.

15. Always Search For Coupons Online
Either before you head out or even when you are in the shopping line with your smart phone. Search for store name coupons. This can get you a quick 20% on your purchases or whatever the daily special is. You won’t hit the jackpot every time, but you never know if you don’t try.

Large department stores are the best for this like Target, Macys, and large chain grocery stores. PLEASE don’t do this just for the deal. But if you have a purchase that passed the 10 second rule, then this is a great way to how to save money fast!

 

Well, I hope we were able to cover a few methods that allow you to discover how to save money fast when you’re in need of some quick cash. I know not all of them can apply to everyone and that we haven’t even scratched he surface of the hundreds of ways there are.

But I really feel these are some of the quickest and largest payback methods to save money fast. Yes, some need extra labor to achieve, but will also offer long term savings.

personalfinance,Issues with student loan servicer,"Here's one way in which my student loan servicer is milking extra money off of me through the interest I pay. A certain portion of my monthly payment (more specifically, the difference between the **accrued interest** and my **minimum monthly payment**) is applied *pro rata* to all of my loans. In other words, they do not allow me to pay according to the avalanche method. I've crunched the numbers, and over the lifetime of my loans this is going to cost me an extra $1000 in interest, as compared to the hypothetical case in which my payments targeted the loan with the highest interest rate.

I've pleaded with them via email and phone calls, and they will not allow me to dictate how this portion of my monthly payment is applied. They automatically pro rate it among all of my loans, in proportion to the balance of each loan.

The question is: is this practice allowed? Or do the guarantees that come with federal student loans include something along the lines of ""the student has the right to direct payments toward whatever loan they would like""?

Do I have any recourse here?

Edit: I just realized that their intentionally inefficient method of directing payments is worse than I originally thought. It precludes the borrower from paying according to the snowball method, too.",finance,1427328537

My situation is this. I was in a job for 10 years where I made $50k a year. Fortunately, I was Ae to secure a job where I now make considerably more. This past year i netted just over $100k. However, in this last year my wife had to stop working, 2 kids at home. Plus I now am responsible to pay 60% of my healthcare cost. 

It was a killer when the wifey had to stop working but we really wouldn't want it any other way so that she is home with the kids. During the time when I was employed at my last job we like a lot of people racked up a lot of cc debt. We now carry over $25k in cc debt. In addition to mort, car and utilities etc. 

Where my frustration comes in now is that based on my current income, should average about $100k. (I am partly on commission.) Without the cc debt our family would be able to get by very comfortably. But due to the amount of cc debt we can't get past those payments. Frankly we are barely able to make all our bills each month. 

Hopefully, no ones thinks that I am a jerk complaining about a situation like this. I know millions would kill to be in a position to make the money I did last year. However, I feel trapped. 

I have tried to snowball the debt but any free money we get has to go other things instantly. 

I have hesitated contacting cc consolidations companies. I feel like if all the cc debt could get paid off in a loan cutting out the interest rate I could manage the payments and get them paid off a lot better.

personalfinance,"I'm Freaking Out Taxes Owed (USA, CA)","Good Afternoon,

I am 23 years old, and have to owe on taxes for the first time in my life. I earned $25k last year and owe $700 in taxes, I was just at HR block to file my W2's. I switched employers in August, which is why I had 2. 

Covered California (Obamacare) is the reason I owe so much, as it apparently pulls from the withholding you elect when hired. I am incredibly aggravated, as this was not how the program was explained to me when I signed up. I was under the impression that it was a federal grant, much like a student grant, the employee that set me up with the plan explained it as such. Had I known it was related to my own taxes, I would've never touched the beast. I chose to go with Covered CA because the insurance terms seemed to be better than what my employer at the time was offering.

In practice, the insurance coverage was terrible, I have a bone injury that is 3 years old, and is causing more complications, I had lots of appointments last year to diagnose and attempt to treat the issue without surgery. I had to stop going to Kaiser, as my bills were/are too high. Even though I was paying a copay of $60 per visit, and had an MRI that cost $800, my current balance owed at Kaiser is about $1500. It seems to me that the insurance offered by Covered CA didn't do jack squat.

Because I withheld a somewhat low amount, and all my withholding went to my insurance plan, I still owe $700 based on the difference of what I withheld and what the federal govt ""subsidized"" my insurance premium with. Had I known this ""assistance"" was funded through my own money, I would've never signed up for it. 

Furthermore, I switched employers in august, does this mean I owe Covered CA for those four months that I wasn't with that employer? My 1095 seems to show it all paid from Jan to Dec. 

I am sorry if I am rambling, I am really quite livid right now and am pretty much venting in the hopes that someone can guide me. 

Oh and I have 0 savings, I rent a little house on my own (roommates drive me crazy, I need space), and have a car loan and credit card debt totaling about $800.

I was planning on using my return to pay off the above mentioned items, but I have been slammed with the opposite of what I was expecting. 

BTW my current employer has fantastic insurance (I think) so next year should be a different story, I just really dug myself in a hole last year by not understanding the Covered CA system, perhaps it wasn't explained to me properly. My bad for thinking the gov't wanted to help out it's poor citizens for once.

personalfinance,Heading to pharmacy school this fall. Looking for any suggestions or advice regarding my financial options for the next few years.,"Just looking for advice and 2nd opinions on the next couple year of my life regarding my finances. 

Background Info

Age 23

Credit Score 722

Checking Account $1400

Savings $6200

Credit Card Debt $200

So I will be headed to pharmacy school this fall. In short a PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy) is a 4 year degree. I managed to make it through all my undergrad studies without having to take out any loans, (I had a baseball scholarship during my first couple years of undergrad, along with a full-time job while I was finishing up my pre-reqs.) so I will be starting pharmacy school without any debt. I was an accounting major for 3 years before switching to pharmacy, so I am very familiar with finance terms. I am hoping to have roughly $10k in savings by the time I start school this fall. Tuition prices have not yet been released for the upcoming year, but I researched costs from the last 7 years and used Excel to forecast what the next 4 years will cost. Tuition will cost me roughly $102,000 over the next 4 combined years. Books and lab fees will add up to roughly $1500 per year. I already have a very nice laptop which should last me 4 years. 

Employment – I have a steady full time (sometimes more) job in a pharmacy. My job pays a reasonably fair salary for my age/experience. I expect to be given a raise in a couple weeks because I will become a “Student Pharmacist” so my monthly income will go from $1900/month to about $2200/month. Although I will be paid more, I will not be able to continue working full time when I start school, so my monthly income will be roughly $1500-$1700/month for 8 months out of the year. I am hoping to contribute $25k out of pocket towards tuition over the next 4 years so my loan total will hopefully be in the 80-90k range.

Paying for School – Depending on my living situation, I have the option for all of my education and living costs to be covered by loans. Basically, if I live on my own, all expenses will be covered by loans, and if I live at home, roughly 1/3 to 1/2 of my expenses will be covered by loans. If I live on my own, I am hoping to contribute $25k out of pocket towards tuition over the next 4 years so my loan total will hopefully be in the 80-90k range, but if I live on my own, I will have to pay much more upfront. 

Apartment/House – My parents have offered to let me live with them during school, which, initially will save on living costs, but I will lose a majority of my financial “aid” packages (loans). Tuition would then dissolve the 10k I will have saved up pretty quick, but I wouldn’t be worried about rent, laundry, etc. However, their house is 7 miles from campus and 13 miles from my job. I am currently living with them so I can keep saving before I start school, but the drive to work (5-7 days a week) is all city driving so I go through gas fairly quick, and the round trip is 60+ minutes on some days. 

I have found an apartment that is a 5 minute walk from campus and about 4 miles from my work. Very well kept, clean, and they’re in a very cool part of the city. Rent, depending on the floorplan I want, is $480-$560 a month. Electric bill is the only other bill I have to cover. This would save on gas money, transit time, and stress of driving all over the place. 

Food – Even though I’m living with my folks at this moment, I still pay for a majority of my food. I expect about $400/month, but that still seems higher than what it actually would be.

Other Expenses – I don’t have many. I live a pretty simple life. Right now I have a gym membership which is $50/month, and then Spotify and Netflix fees which are $15/month total.  Obviously getting an apartment will add to this list. I would have to add in laundry, cable, parking, etc.

Car – Currently getting 15-16 mpg in a 15 year old hand-me-down with 175k miles. It gets me from point A to B, and the A/C and radio work, but the alignment needs to be fixed, oil pressure light occasionally comes on, needs new tires, doesn’t handle very well, but is decent in the snow, and at this point I’m not sure if the engine is okay, or if the engine light is burnt out. Oh and I need to replace the headlights for fourth time in the past 18 months. It serves the purpose of getting me to work and back, and I don’t have to make any payments, but gas, oil changes, and other parts are slowly starting to add up. If I get a new car I would look at getting something smaller in the $10k range with around 90k miles. Looking for 23-25mpg. Right now, a 2007-8 Subaru Impreza is looking like my best option. I would probably put 5-6k down and pay it off over 2 years. This would put me at roughly $200/month depending on my interest rate. Insurance will be roughly $100/month. Gas right now is $150/month, but will only go up during the summer and autumn, so a new car along with an apartment closer to work will bring this down to hopefully $100/month.

Plans after graduation – I hope on getting a hospital residency (2 years long) which pay on average $50k per year. A residency doesn’t pay well compared to other pharmacy jobs, but it will open doors for me in the future. But this isn’t a guarantee, because pharmacy is starting to become super saturated with horribly under-qualified applicants. Worst case scenario - I will have a job lined up as a pharmacist at the pharmacy I currently work at. Although jobs are diminishing, I have made sure that I am very well connected in the pharmacy field in my area. I want to pay my loans back as soon as possible after I am done with school. I hope to have everything paid off with 3 years if I do a residency, or 2 years if I jump straight into a job as a pharmacist.

I guess I’m just looking for a few thoughts or some advice about what would be a manageable situation.
Should I live at home and save on living expenses and loans, but lose most of my savings to tuition?
Should I get an apartment to cut down on travel time and stress, and take out a larger loan?
Should I get a new car to save on gas and fix-ups?
Should I take my savings and start working on an IRA?

Any thoughts, advice, ideas, or suggestions are all appreciated!",finance,1427347989

personalfinance,Investing in the Euro Currency,"So I'm an American living on a military installation in Italy. Lately the Euro has had some trouble and the exchange rate from Euros to dollars went from around .72 to .91 where it is hovering. This is obviously a major hit to the Euro Zone and they're doing everything in their power to lower it again. I'm only 17 years old so I don't have too much money and I can't really do any investing yet but I had an idea. I know for a fact that the exchange rate will lower again, there is no way that the Euro will stay that weak, and if it does, we have other things to worry about. What if I took out all the money in my savings account (which is in dollars) which is around $1700, converted them to Euro, stored them somewhere safe (Let's assume I won't spend it, and there is not danger for me losing it), and when the Euro gained more power and the exchange rate dropped I would exchange them all for dollars. Would I make money? I'm not looking to make hundreds here, I just want to see this whole thing in action. I'm not even really looking for a profit, just enough that I would have more money than what my interest rate would have been. Thanks!",finance,1427358656

I'm currently working as a software developer. I used to love my job but a number of factors (mostly switching technologies and low confidence) I'm pretty fed up. I also play poker on the side and make a reasonable (and steady) income from that. We're currently using YNAB to get a firm idea of our spending but we fall somewhere between 3% and 4% on the SWR.

A job has recently come up in another section of IT (it's on the service/support desk) which I'm considering applying for despite a 33% pay cut, plus it's part time, so actually it's closer to a 66% pay cut in total. As far as I can see I have three options:

1) Quit my job, it'd allow me to pursue other things (I'd love to write a book, make a video game etc) but also comes with lots of potential risk, both of financial and social. A career break (of up to 5 years) is also a possible option.

2) Continue with my current job and hope that it gets better, somehow. Decent income plus job security plus good social oppurtunities.

3) Go for the other job with a reduced amount of hours and vastly reduced salary. Hope I enjoy it better than this one.

Any thoughts please? I'm not happy at the moment but honestly I think there's a chance that the other job (or being at home all day) won't necessarily help.

SEC Adopts Rules to Facilitate Smaller Companies’ Access to Capital

Washington D.C., March 25, 2015 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted final rules to facilitate smaller companies’ access to capital. The new rules provide investors with more investment choices. The new rules update and expand Regulation A, an existing exemption from registration for smaller issuers of securities. The rules are mandated by Title IV of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.
The updated exemption will enable smaller companies to offer and sell up to $50 million of securities in a 12-month period, subject to eligibility, disclosure and reporting requirements.

“These new rules provide an effective, workable path to raising capital that also provides strong investor protections,” said SEC Chair Mary Jo White. “It is important for the Commission to continue to look for ways that our rules can facilitate capital-raising by smaller companies.”

The final rules, often referred to as Regulation A+, provide for two tiers of offerings: Tier 1, for offerings of securities of up to $20 million in a 12-month period, with not more than $6 million in offers by selling security-holders that are affiliates of the issuer; and Tier 2, for offerings of securities of up to $50 million in a 12-month period, with not more than $15 million in offers by selling security-holders that are affiliates of the issuer. Both Tiers are subject to certain basic requirements while Tier 2 offerings are also subject to additional disclosure and ongoing reporting requirements.

The final rules also provide for the preemption of state securities law registration and qualification requirements for securities offered or sold to “qualified purchasers” in Tier 2 offerings. Tier 1 offerings will be subject to federal and state registration and qualification requirements, and issuers may take advantage of the coordinated review program developed by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA).
The rules will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.",cryptocurrency,1427369315

personalfinance,The relationship between International Exchange Rates and Domestic Interest Rates,"My wife has about $45,000 (Canadian) in student loan debt remaining.  We live and work in the U.S. and have been making aggressive monthly payments by transferring U.S. Dollars (USD) to a special cross-boarder bank account, exchanging for Canadian Dollars (CAD), and then making the monthly payment.

For the last year or so, the exchange rate had hovered at about 1.10 CAD per 1.00 USD.  However, earlier this year, due to concerns about its economy, the Canadian government lowered its interest rate.  The exchange rate jumped, and has remained around 1.25 CAD per 1.00 USD.  This really helps us pay down the debt, as you can imagine.

I was hoping that someone could explain or verify my assumptions about the relationship between international exchange rates and domestic interest rates.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but my guess is that with a lower interest rate in Canada, it was less desirable to save or loan CAD, so demand for the CAD dropped, resulting in a lower exchange vs the USD.

I'm asking because we will be coming into enough money to pay off the debt over the next few months, but I hear rumors of the U.S. Federal Reserve possibly raising rates this summer.  If my stated assumption holds true, won't demand for the USD rise again?  I'm looking to time the debt payoff to save the most money.

investing,What Fundamentals Affect Commodity Prices,"Good morning! Today Troy continues with the investing for beginners series. You can check the previous posts about What are stocks and how to value them, How does Currency Trading Work, How are Currencies Traded, Investing in Commodities

In the previous post I explained the basics of commodity investing. In this post, I’m going to explain exactly what fundamental factors affect commodity prices.

A Precursor
Commodity prices tend to rise and fall together, much like how stock prices rise and fall together. As the saying goes, “a rising tide lifts all boats”. If the entire U.S. economy is doing well, generally all stocks will go up. The fundamentals below impact all commodity prices.

Inflation
Inflation is a huge factor that can impact commodity prices. Thanks to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, all commodities are officially listed in U.S. dollars. Here are two important terms that you need to know

Nominal value
Real value
The nominal value of a commodity is the “official price”. If gold per ounce is at $1300 right now, then the nominal value is $1300. If inflation is 100% (a hypothetical scenario), then the nominal value of gold will also increase by 100%, doubling to $2600 per ounce.

The real value of a commodity takes into account for inflation. Let’s assume that gold is at $1300 an ounce. If inflation increases by 100%, the nominal value will increase, but the real value is exactly the same. There’s just more U.S. dollars chasing after the same amount of gold in this world!

As investors, we only care about the nominal value. Thus, when inflation picks up, commodity prices soar across the board! This is what happened in Germany with hyperinflation in the 1930’s – a loaf of bread cost a bajillion Marks (Germany’s currency at the time) to buy. The real value didn’t change (a loaf of bread is still a loaf of bread), but the nominal value exploded.

This is what happened in the U.S. during the 1970s (although it wasn’t as severe as it was in Germany). U.S. inflation skyrocked (14% per year), and commodity price spiked in the 1970s. Gold went from $30 an ounce to $600 an ounce.

Right now, we are seeing the early phases of inflation where inflation will pick up but has not started yet. Ben Bernake (Chairman of the Federal Reserve) has a genius solution to America’s economic woes – print money! That’s essentially the name of the game for his consecutive rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE). Sooner or later, this money printing is going to catch up to him (or us American taxpayers, actually) with huge inflation. And what happens when inflation hits? Commodity prices skyrocket.

Increased Demand, Decreased Supply
There is a fixed amount of supply in this world – it’s not like we can manufacture gold (alchemy!) or copper. On the other hand, demand is increasing exponentially. Can you imagine if every person in the world lived the way us Americans did! Considering the amount of stuff we waste each year (that’s how my relatives from Europe put it), the world’s resources would be depleted in a heart beat.

With developing nations increasing their standards of living, the world’s demand for raw materials such as oil and copper is outstripping supply. The Chinese are a huge buying force in the world – they are rebuilding their country after:

1800s: Britain literally robs China of all its gold and silver by drugging the entire nation with Opium (prior to the 1800s, drugs didn’t exist in China). It’s called The Century of Humiliation. China went from #1 in the world (literally, the “Middle Kingdom”) to dead last.
Early 1900s: Chinese Civil War
1950 – 1978: the Communist fiasco (Chairman Mao ruined China).
So really, China’s literally been rebuilding its entire country over the past 30 years. And because China is so big (both geographically and population wise), China consumes a ton of resources.

This trend in increasing demand and shrinking supply is only going to continue, thereby pushing up commodity prices. Factor in some more inflation thanks to King Bernake from the Federal Reserve, and you have the perfect set up for a long term bull market in commodities.

I looked at my loans and it looks like I'll be paying about $340/month if I don't consolidate or use an extended payback plan. Is consolidating worthwhile, or should I pay the minimum on each loan per month, and if I have extra funds make an additional payment on the loan with the highest interest rate?


I am also looking for housing in the town I'm moving to and after searching all the newspapers and housing sites it looks like my best options in-town are rental houses renting from $550-750/month (not including utilities), and I can get down to $480/month (not including utilities) apartments if I am willing to commute 30 minutes to work. With my income and considering student loan payments, is living in town affordable? Ideally I want to avoid a long commute. I should mention this job is at a school and I'll have free access to the dining halls for every meal which will drastically reduce cost of groceries.

personalfinance,Update on 6 years of Lending Club,"Around 2009 I put a little money in lending club just to see what would happen.

At the time I thought investing $25 per loan and staggering the loan ratings (1 part F rated loans, 2 parts E, 3 D and so on) was a good idea. I just followed this pattern thoughtlessly for years - I had a few defaults, but it seemed to work.

Finally I downloaded the full database to try to pick out a pattern for avoiding defaults. Here's the conclusion I arrived at ([data set here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ps7ZdhHd8K9tbwkHgZyn5OablKa7Nh2uvw8dQiB91A/edit?usp=sharing))

* Only $25 per loan
* A-C is just not worth it, return is tiny or negative when defaults are accounted for
* Home owners never default, grab those with the highest interest rates first
* Non Home owners with dti under 20% never default, grab this after home owners run out
* If you can time travel avoid 2010

It's still too soon to tell but so far I have no new defaults and a growing average Weighted Average Rate of 14.54%... whatever that means.

personalfinance,I started a company six months ago as a side-project/hobby. Things have grown tremendously and I'm looking at a potentially HUGE windfall. What do I need to know to prepare for it?,"Apologies in advance if this all sounds like a lot of rambling but I'm still starting to get comfortable with the reality that this is really on the brink of happening for me.

Some background on the business:

I started a small, specialty products company about 6 months ago with a couple of friends of mine. Per our initial investments, my share of the business is 70%. We incorporated as an LLC before we started any business activities; we all went to school for business and wanted to make sure all our t's were crossed i's were dotted before we started advertising products for sale.

The business brought in $1000 in its first three months, $1000 in the fourth month, $2000 in the fifth, and we did about $3500 last month. Our net has been pretty slim to this point because we started out with a meager $10k in cash and any profits we've made have just been re-invested back into the business. The business also owes about $10k worth of debt to family members and friends that loaned us money to help us finance orders along the way.

I was contacted last week by a gentleman from an Asian country that is extremely interested in our products. We have sent him some samples and we have a soft commitment for a very, very large (for us) order. If his company likes what we've sent him, they will make a contract with us to order a very large monthly recurring order for at least a year. After our costs to produce everything, we're looking at, conservatively, a monthly profit of $50,000.

Now, some background on me:

I'm 28 years old and live in the US. I grew up with not very much money at all. My parents brought me here from our third world country when I was still in diapers, they worked near-minimum-wage jobs nearly all their lives to raise me and my three younger siblings. The older three of us are now all college-educated with good, stable careers and the youngest is doing well in high school. We all went to public school but education was always a very high priority and we all did very well; I went to an expensive private university.

My parents bought their first home in the year 2000 and then, as it's been told to me, took a second mortgage out in 2005 to start a restaurant business. The first few years the restaurant did very well, then it started doing very, very poorly, to the point where my parents are now nearly bankrupt. My mom still works almost full time as a contractor in the medical field; my dad is pretty much retired due to disability -- he's dealt with heart conditions since he was in his mid-30's.

I work as an engineer currently and make a pretty comfortable 70k a year. I live with my girlfriend who also has a stable job making about 50k. That being said, even though we have a relatively high household income, we have almost no free money because I've been taking care of the majority of my parents' bills for the past couple of years. My savings is nil at this point, but I've always had a risk-taking entrepreneurial mindset which is why I went in on this business to begin with.

Anyway, now I'm looking at potentially getting $35,000 a month from the profits off of this order, for at least a year. Hopefully more but I'm being realistic about it. I also won't start acting like I have it until it's actually real and the money has actually been wired and I see my share of it land in my own personal account.

The first few months of this, I don't plan on taking any dividends of the money, as we want to continue to grow the business and we need to invest in better facilities, more employees and equipment, and pay off our debts first and foremost. I want to build a nest egg in the business account to about $50k so just in case we need to make a large purchase or satisfy an even larger PO, we don't have to worry.

Once that's been settled, then I'll start attacking my debts. I have $90k in student loans, but the interest rates are all around 2.5% so I'm not sure if I should just pay that off since I'll have the money or continue making my minimum payments because the interest is lower than historical inflation rates. I have credit card debt of about $3k, two car loans on which I owe about $20k each (one of them is for my parents' car which I pay most of the payments on). My credit is not great, either, so I'd like to do everything I can to improve that score as quickly as possible so I can look at purchasing a home sometime in the next couple of years.

So, those are my priorities, but I don't know what to do about taxes -- whether to tax the LLC's profits directly or continue to treat this as a pass-through like we did for last year's losses. I also don't know the first thing about looking for a qualified financial advisor or if that's even necessary making this kind of money (420k a year less taxes and expenses, est.). I'll also probably want to hire an accountant to handle my business's financial situation and an attorney to ensure everything is kosher with the legal aspects of the business and the partnership. I'd like to of course invest heavily and responsibly to make sure this money lasts a good long time if it does dry up after the first year, I might also want to look into investing in other small business ventures in other sectors just to hedge my bets.

So I guess what I need is some general advice. Of course I'm going to pay all of my debts first with the possible exception of the student loans, I'll also want to put some money into my parents' accounts, take on paying all of their bills (~$2000/month) and make sure that they are comfortable and happy because of the things that they've done for me; but beyond that, how do I handle having this much money? The most money I've probably ever had at one time is $15,000 and even then it was a student loan disbursement for an entire year of expenses.

personalfinance,Should I make my quarterly tax payments?,"I started a new job in January classified as an independent contractor. I did the 2015 1040es worksheet to determine if I need to make quarterly payments. I've determined that my estimated payment should be $800-ish. But this is based off of income from last year that is significantly less than this year. My husband and I joint-filed (he receives w2's) and we got $8600 for a Federal refund. The only differences for this year will be my newly self-employed status and much higher income, so we expect the return we file to be the same next year for 2015. 

Last year's total federal taxes were $9900 and this year's estimated federal taxes are $13,200. My income is a fixed number for the year. the only thing I don't know is how much we will be itemizing combined. We itemize more than the standard deduction. My thought is that when we file our 2015 return, the taxes I would owe on my income would come out of whatever refund we would get.

When we asked our tax guy (CPA) how much I should be setting aside for taxes, he said I don't really need to based on how much we've been getting in refunds the last couple of years, but 10%-15% if I felt I needed to. I asked him how much my quarterly taxes should be based on 2014 and 2015 and he said to not worry about it for the same reason.

I've been searching the IRS website for exactly how much the penalty is for underpayment quarterly or if I only make my tax payment come next season but I can't find anything. So my question to you guys is should I make the quarterly payment and if not will I be subject to a penalty?

Edit: I have the money to pay these quarterly taxes. My concern is that the estimate is based off of last year's income and this years will almost double. So either way I feel like I'll be paying a penalty. I've done the 1040es and those are the numbers I came up with. I'd rather leave the money in my savings earning interest if the penalty is negligible.

personalfinance,Should I buy a house in cash or leave the money in a mutual fund?,"I am in my late 30s and I live in Philadelphia.  I would like to buy a house in the near future at around $200K.  To get the down payment of 20%, I would need to take money out of a mutual fund and pay long term capital gains on it (maybe $2K in taxes).  I recently got to thinking that I have enough in the mutual funds to take the whole $200K so that I could pay for the house in cash - there would be obvious benefits like no mortgage payments and the ability to save tons every month, but it would seriously dig into my savings and I'd take that capital gains hit (probably a little over $10K).  

I'd just like to know from a pure financial point of view whether buying in cash would make sense or whether I should just put 20% down.  I assume the value of the home would rise well as I plan to buy in a desirable area but still with room to get better.   

Other facts: My salary is $80K and I have approx $420K in mutual funds and IRAs (2/3 of that is in mutual funds, 1/3 in IRA).  I have about $15K in a savings account that could cover closing costs and about $15K in my current retirement account (pension account that I will likely never vest in).

This is my first post so please bare with me.

I'm 21 and currently work as an assistant manager at a telecommunication retail store here in Canada. My salary is 31500 gross, plus commission on every last pay of the month which is roughly 500-600. I have looked and there are better paying jobs but here I have 90% coverage on everything with* no yearly cap (I've been advised that this is probably one of the best benefits plans anyone has heard of)

The TLDR of the situation is that I purchased a car at an auction for 3000. This is my fault as common sense on a purchase that large the interest is not easily managed, but alas before purchase when I spoke to my bank they said that it would be fine.

Now I'm sitting at over 9000 owing after consolidating that credit card and another I have into one credit card with a credit limit of 10K.
I make payments of atleast 200-300 every month but the balance doesn't seem to be changing I check my statement every month online and think ""Hey I've been doing good with these payments"" only to find out that I owe more and more, keeping in mind I haven't used this credit card for anything in the passed 5 months.
Is it better to save up one huge lump sum of money to throw on there so that the interest rate drops?

My absolute expenses that don't change are my rent, phone bill and car insurance. This equals to about $800 per month which is maybe one pay check and then I have about $1200 average on the second check with commission.

If anyone can help maybe with how I should pay, how I should budget or what are the proper approaches I can do with my salary and pay throughout the year. 

This causes me alto of grief and I'm very depressed as it is (not just about this) and with this much debt hanging over me I don't think I can do this.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

personalfinance,"I have like zero long-term financial plans, help.","I'm 26 and kinda late to the whole employment game. Currently working part time making $10 an hour and grossing between $640 and $850 a month, usually towards the lower end. This is the best job I have ever had, hours are reliable, position is long term and I could potentially work here for as long as I want, and at the end of the summer I will likely be taking over the other person's shift and working 32 hours a week, which is the maximum amount of hours I could ever get here. I need a consistent work record, so I am going to continue working here until at least next January.

My monthly expenses are:

* $300 rent (my portion)
* Anywhere between $25-90 total for both utilities &amp; internet. Bf would like $90 when I have enough money that month to contribute that much.
* $50 phone bill
* $25 payment towards a hospital debt.
* I get food stamps, but it doesn't cover all of my food, and I have to buy cat food/supplies and basic living things like toiletries, obviously.

I have two debts:

One, which I'm paying off, is a ~$250 hospital debt. It went to collections because I ignored it (was told it would be paid by a low income health charity, it wasn't, long story) and has an 18% interest rate. I have been paying it off for 10 months now and half my monthly payment is just paying interest. It's terrible.

The other is about $5000 in student loans. I have, apparently, been missing monthly payments for the past year despite submitting unemployment and then financial hardship deferments THREE TIMES. Legally I shouldn't have to pay it, I make too little and even the people I've spoken to at the loan company agree I definitely qualify for deferments, but they refuse to accept my deferment requests. Last one was rejected because my proof of receiving food stamps was handwritten.... by the food stamp worker. That is just how those letters work, it's a form letter that they hand-fill and stamp. I have no idea what to do about this.

No credit card debt. I stay far away from those, especially as I have no idea what to do with them.

Oh, and I guess I should mention that I have $0 in savings.

How do I pay off all my debt with this income, and how long should it take me? Preferably without living like I'm starving to death, I like to have *some* spending money... I know I need a better plan and budget, I don't really have a budget outside of making sure said list of expenses are paid for each month.

Also, should I be doing something to save for the future? I mean, I have debt, so I feel like that's kind of pointless and any ""savings"" money should go straight to debtors...

My family growing up was very poor (mom and I lived off $7k one year) and I have literally no concept of savings, retirement (hah, who can afford to retire?), buying a house etc. It sort of feels like, who even does that?

But I really want to be middle class. Okay, scratch that, I'd really like to be upper middle class, eventually. I want to live a comfortable life, travel, and just not worry so much. I do not want to have children, so that's one less expense to worry about.

personalfinance,Applied for equity line of credit- bank suggested that my remaining mortgage could be rolled into it.,"I applied for an equity line of credit through my credit union to do some home improvements. The loan officer that called back today offered that the remaining ~$73K of my mortgage, held by Wells Fargo, could be paid off with the loan. This wasn't something I was prepared to expect. Is this a good idea?

My current (15yr) mortgage is ~73K, maturity date 3/26 at 4.25% (current monthly payment $1,283.41 including $436.27 principle/$261.91 interest  and $585.23 escrow)

The line of credit would be officially a 15 year interest only lien with a balloon payment due at the end, at 4% (he said they could do a fixed 4% rate when I balked at converting to a variable rate ""mortgage"".).
There would be no loan origination fees.

He said this would mean I officially own the home, with them listed as 1st lien holder.

I understand this means I would be responsible for tax and insurance payments, which are currently done via the bank through escrow.
I also realize that I don't feel comfortable with the interest only aspect, but principle could be paid off early.

I believe that the line of credit's interest would also be tax deductible? This would be a presumed major deciding factor.

Are there other concerns I should think about. It seems like this would be a good idea- it's effectively a refinance without fees, though my local credit union (vs a big faceless bank), at a %0.25 lower interest rate, that allows me to draw from it for home improvements.

personalfinance,Interest vs Credit Gain?,"Hi PF, I spoke to a financial adviser a few months ago about building credit after a bankruptcy (canada). They suggested acquiring 1 credit card at first and a second down the road but not pay off my car loan.

My problem is I just found out I am getting a bonus at work that could end my car payments but my adviser said to keep paying them for the credit reports instead of saving.

The logic of Roth makes sense as I expect my last job to be much higher paying. However, if my wife stops working to have kids and never goes back, am I correct that Roth only makes sense if my retiring salary is more than our two combined now?

We both know that her $10/hr will not work in the big picture, but it is fine for now as she plots out her career plan.

------------------------------

Hey all.  I've been lurking this subreddit for a while and I love seeing so many other frugal people to help teach me to continue being financially responsible.  I thought maybe all of you might be a good place to go to get some advice on how to plan out the next few years(/decades) as we face this new chapter and financial change.

Here's some background:  I'm 23 (live in the US), just graduated from school with a BFA in Filmmaking.  I am now working for $20/hr as a full time video editor (with an extra $200-$500/mo earned from freelance), and my gf/fiancee of 7 years (24) is working for $10/hr almost full time as a teacher at a daycare (making some extra money during Summer/Fall doing freelance photography for weddings and family photos, her degree is a BFA in fine art photography).  She loves teaching (infants and toddlers), and I support her as long as she is happy and we are not financially struggling.  I was raised in a family that struggled often financially, so I was taught how to save money and budget well.  She admits she isn't as good with money, and typically trusts my input/decisions when it comes to financial planning (EDIT: I included this bit not to say she has put me in charge, or she is incompetent with money, just that she trusts me with financial things and she is putting forth a great effort to learn and improve her own financial habits/skills so this doesn't all just fall onto me).  She's doing a great job improving her financial habits, and I'm very proud of how far she's come.  We will be getting married in September, a wedding of 300 guests, with a frugal budget of around $5k-$6k (it was important to me that our wedding allow us to still have a $1k-$2k safety net so we have a foundation to begin saving again afterwards, so many friends offered favors for the wedding and our budget ended up being realistic enough).  The money for this has been saved and now rests in my savings account, so I'm at the point now where I need to start thinking further ahead for our plan after the wedding.

So here's the big changes I'll be facing.  We do not share money yet, so that will begin after getting married.  In the same month of the wedding, I will begin repayment of my $47k in student loans.  She has been graduated for over a year already, so she is already making payments on her $60k+ student loans.  My loans are all federal unsub/sub loans, but her's are a mixture of federal and private.  My plan for dealing with these is to basically choose the smallest required payment plan, but pay more than that per month in order to use the additional money specifically for paying off the loans with high interest rates first.  Neither of us have any credit card debt or any car payments to worry about.  We're both driving beater cars though so I will be planning to save up for at least one nice, used car, to be paid for in cash if I can make it that far before one of ours breaks down.

I guess my question is this:  Am I planning the right way so far?  What can I do moving forward to ensure that we get our debts paid as smartly and efficiently as possible?  I know next to nothing about investment options, so if you think that investing in my future is something I should consider, please help me understand what I need to do in a ELI5 manner.

When moving away from a barter based, gift based, 'you owe me one' economy, and forming money for the first time, every single form of money that came into existance in every tribe on earth had an important quality, inherent scarcity.

Humans were smart enough to know that it is a stupid idea to make money out of something that someone else can just create out of nothing! So they evolved money from using rare stones to rare shells etc and eventually we ended up globally with gold..

Today our human civilization have somehow decided that we should make money out of pieces of paper and digital entry credits that can be made without restriction, out of nothing.. and not only that but we have decided to put that power in a central group of unelected bankers, who's sole purpose at this point in time is to manipulate the price of money (interest rate), and print massive amounts of money (QE) to stop their subsidiary banks going out of business!!

personalfinance,Feds - New House Budget plan could seriously affect TSP investments (US),"[This](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2015/03/24/g-funds-return-would-drop-to-nearly-zero-under-house-plan/) was an interesting article on the Washington Post about the potential* impact of the Republican plan on federal employee's Thrift Savings Plan investments. For those who don't know, the TSP is the equivalent of a 401(k) for government workers (i.e. tax-deferred retirement account with matching contributions in most cases).

Basically, the new plan would convert the existing G fund from a protected investment with guaranteed (albeit small) returns into not much more than sitting cash. The reduction in returns would save the government $32 billion dollars over ten years. 

I also thought it was fascinating (and disheartening) that 43% of all participants keep 100% of their contributions in the G fund. That suggests an unfortunate combination of non-contribution (the government usually makes a 1% automatic contribution, and by default contributions go to the G fund) and poor financial education.

personalfinance,"Likelihood collections agency will go for garnished wages, an account levy, or my car in my situation?","**TL;DR** I read the FAQ and guides and didn't quite find an answer. I didn't know until today that a student loan was owed to a university and not the Department of Education (because it was for a while included in my DoE student loan account). I got a collections letter today threatening to seek a judgment if I don't take action within 30 days. I don't know if the loan even counts as a student loan (see below) at this point, and I don't know if I'm going to be hit with garnishment, a levy on my bank account, or having my car taken from me.

Okay, last year I had planned to move to New York to attend a graduate program. For medical (and related financial) reasons, I withdrew right away and ended up in a cheaper state instead. A loan refund had already been disbursed, and I thought I'd have to pay it back, so I didn't touch it. However, time went by and I never heard from the Department of Education. The loan was included in my federal student loan account, and I knew I was already on the hook for origination fees and interest. As I said, I was in a bad spot financially without any preparation (as I had expected to move to study with financial aid), and it appeared that the DoE was treating this refund like any student loan. I decided to do the same, and I chose to get by financially after waiting a couple of months to touch it.

I received a collections letter today saying I owe *the university* the amount of the refund (let's say about $8,000). It turns out that sometime around the time I decided to use some of what I thought was being treated as a regular student loan, the DoE decided I didn't owe them for that loan and I suddenly owed the university instead. Their only attempt to communicate with me (despite having my phone number and a permanent email address) was to send an email to my student email account, which I stopped checking after withdrawing from classes because, hey, I wasn't a student.

Given that the university and the collections agency are in New York, I'm assuming this issue is subject to New York's rules even though I'm in another state. Does this still count as a student loan, since apparently it was a ""refund"" for a loan that retroactively shouldn't have happened?

I make very little money and have very little in the bank. Garnished wages might not be a big issue, but I still worry about having my bank account frozen. I paid about $4,000 for my car a couple of years ago, so it's got to be worth less by now, and I keep seeing that $4,000 or below means a car is exempt. If I can't work out something with the university or the collections agency, and the CA seeks a judgment (as they've threatened to do soon), is there still a chance I could have my car taken from me? Would a different state's rules apply since I don't live in New York? Can I obtain something definitive that will prove my car is worth less than $4,000, despite price being subjective?

I'm going to *actually* begin graduate school in a few months at another university, and I'll have full funding with no need for loans. I guess my wages could be garnished then. Would there be any other fallout from this, besides a massive hit to my credit score? Would it be even minutely better to use a student loan this fall to pay this debt? That sounds like a terrible plan, but I don't know what else I can do.

I know this is a stupid situation, and I know this is my fault. I know there's always something more I could have done to get by without using that money. I know I could have continued checking after a couple of months had passed to make sure something like this didn't happen. I'm looking for advice for what I can do now.

Edit: to clarify, I thought when I was making student loan payments the past several months that I was also paying down this loan. The last time I checked, it was included. Before I made the call to use some of the refunded money, I checked to see if the total for my student loans included this amount. It did.

I have owned my home for a year. I bought an awesome house that I really like and can afford.

The house was $182k. I earn more than that annually. I still have an urge to pay this sucker off as quickly as humanly possible. It feels like a crushing 160k student loan (4.375% interest rate). I know a mortgage is an ""acceptable form of debt"", but I'm still giving a bank a lot of money every month. 

I realize I can invest elsewhere to earn a higher rate (which I do), and that leverage is good. But I still am going against what I know is logical (investing in a brokerage account and writing off mortgage interest) to erase this debt.

This is the ONLY substantial review I could find of the game:

http://tradingcardgames.com/review/summoners-legion/

It's a free game released 2014. The game offers a LOT of rewarding missions/achievements, some refreshing daily, and others weekly. I've put 50+ hours in, and the first 10 hours I didn't think I would like the game tbh because the combat seemed shallow :p

But PvP is where it's at, and there is actually a wealth of nuanced combat here once you hit level 20+. Also, lots of the game is stamina locked (which is a mechanic I hate), but PvP is always free, and seems where the game is meant to shine. The ladder resets weekly.

The card leveling system is also a LOT of fun. Cards that look weak become powerhouses when they unlock new skills, and cards that are already powerhouses just get better. Although, it pays to spend some time collecting cards and coming up with strategies before committing to leveling cards up. Leveling requires resources, and the game seems to feed you enough resources to keep one deck maxxed as you level up, but building alternate decks becomes expensive.

Raiding is fun, especially in a guild, and probably with friends, if I had any fucking friends who would play it with me, everyone in my local gaming community has ALREADY moved on to Bloodbourne. Fuckers. You know who you are.

Last thing: The art direction and UI is shitthai as fhkc. Banner ads abound. Every scantily-clad character model looks like she is one poor life-decision away to becoming a character in Evony, beckoning you my lord. Also, actually chatting in-game with other people is such a miraculous fuckup, it's like the devs want people to bot it. Speaking of which, you can set your deck to afk and let it grind for you, and that makes me go wut?

tl,dr; Game seems amazing for 2v2. Raiding is fun but probably grindy. Expansive, fun game mechanics. No pay gate up to mid game, dunno about late game. Visual direction and UI resembles a webpage from 1999, and not in a fun ""retro"" way, you nostalgic fucking hipster.",technology,1427490393

We would like to keep $15k minimum after down payment for an emergency fund.  After taxes, benefits and 401k contributions, we take home around $80k/year.  The most popular rule of thumb is 2.5-3x take home monthly pay for all housing expenses (PITI/PMI).  This would put us somewhere around $2000 per month in housing costs which with today's rates comes out to around $350k max purchase price with 10% down.

Zillow, Bankrate and the like obviously have us affording a $500k mansion but let me just say that is absolutely ridiculous.  I want vacations and food for my family.

Our only monthly debts are my wife's $175 0% car loan and about $300 in student loans between us all with about a 5% interest rate.

So /r/pf, would we be okay with a $350k home? Anyone else have similar stats and pulled the trigger on a home? Just looking for as much advice as possible.

Bitcoin,[shower thoughts] Could Bitcoin be an evolutionary adaption of Monetary value seeking to embrace and reinforce the concept of Globalization?,"Certainly, it could just be tin-foil hattery (if you think so, then call me out on that and give me the holes in reasoning please).  

I'm remembering how back in 2005 the issue of 'racing to the bottom' was a continued subject of interest in the news media.  Many of us remember NAFTA and the backlash it caused amongst blue collar which then transitioned to grey collar workers stateside.  

Looking at Bitcoin from a purely critical standpoint, would it not also be in the better interest for any government actors (NA or  EU or BRICS or even just individual nations) to PRETEND to dismiss bitcoin as a 'non-backed, valueless currency substitute', like a sleight of hand, while also conversely building up infrastructure? 

The flood of VC funded Exchanges and remittance services comes to mind - [the interesting read about Changetip](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/30cke3/inside_changetip_a_special_buttcoin_investigative/) yesterday and how companies DO have information as a commodity that can be for sale also seems warranted when we're talking about the potential repercussions of a government entity attempting to strong-arm its way into ownership of the previously private infrastructure.  (Yes, I feel that article could be considered overtly biased against Changetip but the writer raised logically valid points and I appreciated the read.) 

While it may be true that these are private ventures, would it not also make sense for the governments hosting these businesses to turn around (once market conditions seem prime to do so) and to simply take over and regulate these Bitcoin exchanges under the guise that its a global currency and thus is required to be under the purview of the Federal Reserve?

Hypothetically speaking, if I were the USA (an entire nation and government) - wouldn't it be in my best interests to lie about Bitcoin and allow it to placate all traditional sovereign fiat currencies, knowing that my ultimate plan is to hold controlling interest over a majority of the nodes, mining power, and exchanges?

personalfinance,Roth versus Traditional 401K - Resident physician using income-based loan repayment,"So here's my situation. I'm graduating medical school and am about to start my first year of residency with 176k in student loans that will have interest rate of 6.42% after consolidation. Since my planned career path will put me in training for 6 years in public universities, I plan to try and take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF) which in its current form will forgive all of my debt after 10 years working in non-profit or public hospitals. This means I can take income based repayment (IBR) during residency making paltry loan payments and will only have to make minimum standard payments for 4 years at a full physicians salary.

I've worked out what my loans would be after the full 10 years (6 in IBR ~$250/mo, 4 at standard payments of $1990/mo as a full physician) and if I don't take a break in the next ten years can plan to have to pay only $117k total back and will have just about 200k forgiven. I understand the political risk that comes with this program but hope I will be grandfathered in to the PSLF without changes if a new law is passed.

Now to question, sorry for the length. Given that I'm pursuing the PSLF, it makes no sense to pay anymore than bare minimums on my loans for 10 years. This frees up some money to make 401K contributions during residency. Typically residents are advised to make contributions to Roth 401k/IRAs during residency because our incomes will be considerably lower during this period than when we retire (50k vs. 200K+). However, because I'm using income-based repayment for the next 6 years, traditional 401k/IRA comes out as pre-tax money, reducing my taxable income, and essentially freeing up an extra 10% of decreased payments through residency.

**tl;dr** Anyone have any thoughts about whether the possible 10% saved on traditional IRA by decreased loan payments will overcome the benefits of having money in a Roth when I eventually retire as a physician?

I was searching online and on Reddit for an answer to this question and I didn't see one.   Hopefully someone will know the best way to proceed.

I just completely paid off a VISA that I have which is connected with a retail store I visit often and which comes with great perks.   The problem is that now that I've had it for a few years, the interest rate is ridiculously high and I'm not really interested in continuing to use this particular account and paying that interest.   Is it possible to open a second VISA associated with this store and either close/let the inactive card stay inactive or can I somehow use my situation as a bargaining chip to get a reduced interest rate now that I paid off a large sum and want to continue using this retail VISA?

Secondary question:  This retail store is offering a special deal for people wanting to open an account with this card.   Am I ineligible for this particular perk if I already have an account?   Just wondering if it's worth mentioning when I phone them.

personalfinance,"23 years old, fresh out of college with ~60k in loans. Just landed a job with 105k salary. Help me not screw this up!","Hey everyone -  

Just looking for a little guidance / validation.  I start my job in a couple months, and have a lot of things I need to consider. 

- First and foremost, I have to move to a different state.  I'm moving from the Bay Area, one of the most expensive areas in the country.  What should my maximum housing budget be for renting?  I've heard something like 1/3 of your income is an acceptable amount to sacrifice.  Is that accurate?

- Budgeting: I have very few financial obligations at the moment.  I own my car outright, and it's in decent working condition so I don't expect to need to get any major repairs for a while.  Right now I'm concerned about getting my student loans paid down ASAP, and not buying a bunch of stupid shit.  Loans are my priority.  I'm sitting around 60k total.  Half that is private at like 12% average interest rate.  I want those gone before the 6 month deferment is over.  I'm prepared to drop at least an entire paycheck every month into it if I can.  The other half is federal, so maximum of 6%.  How quickly should I get that paid off?  I've heard as soon as possible from some sources, while other sources have told me to stretch it over a few years and don't be in a hurry.  As for buying stupid shit, I've lived comfortably on school loan checks for the last 3 years or so.  I've had to make the same amount I'll be getting every two weeks last three to four months at a time.  It's easy to say I can keep up that lifestyle and save while paying off loans, but I know most people in my situation end up wanting to live a little better.  I think that that's OK as long as I'm reasonable about it.  How can I keep that in check?

- Building credit: I got in a scuffle with comcast and they hurt my credit.  I'm sub 600 right now, but I figure I still have time to build it back to being pretty good.  I'm thinking the best plan is to open a bank/credit union card and pay everything with that, then set up an autopay from my checking every month so I don't get into trouble.  What are some automated ways I can do this responsibly?  

- Investing:  As part of my starting package, I'm given $3,000 of company stock over the next 3 years.  Additionally, I'll have an opportunity to buy more stock every quarter at a significant discount.  Keep in mind that this is company is in the top 50 of the Fortune 500.  Their stock is very well known and considered a safe stock.  How much should I squirrel away into this?  I'd like to invest well enough that I can do day trading and support myself that way eventually.  When should I diversify?

- Retirement:  My company offers 401k matching up to 6% a year.  It seems obvious to take advantage of this, but I know that Roth IRAs are a thing.  I'm not sure the relationship between the two.  Is there a way I can get the matching AND the good interest rates AND tax benefits?

- Taxes:  I looked at my shiny new tax bracket and oh my sweet baby Jesus my federal rate is 28%.  How can I mitigate this?  My company offers donation matching to charities up to 24k a year, and I'd rather the money go to a specific charity that has helped my family in the past rather than the IRS.  That being said, I'd also like to keep as much as possible.  What can I do to keep my money in my pocket?  It should be noted that there is no state income tax in my new state.

personalfinance,Going to Europe for the summer and exploring emergency fund options,"So, my girlfriend and I are two college students who will be backpacking all over Europe this summer for 2 and a half months. 
What is booked so far: 
All our accommodations and transportation from city to city. We have a very good travel credit card with no foreign transaction fees and no interest for first 24 months. We plan to use this card in Europe and just have a few hundred euros on hand just in case certain places don't accept credit cards. So, we have about $6,000 saved up for food/fun(museums, boat trips etc). I have done months of research and believe that that amount will suffice for the period of 2 and a half months in Europe especially considering how close the euro is to the dollar, at the moment. My main question is, I would like to set myself up with an emergency fund where I don't have to pay any interest if I don't use the money and it just sits in my account. This rules out a personal loan because I'll start accruing interest immediately even if it's just sitting in my account not being used. Whole it would only be about $200 max, I think that possibly getting a personal or student line of credit would be the more viable option. My question is when you get a line of credit, do they just deposit the funds into a new checking account or is it like a credit card where the only option to withdraw money is through cash advance and suffer interest rate/foreign transaction fees for every emergency withdraw I make? 

Again, I don't plan on using this money unless my estimations were hilariously wrong or I get my credit card stolen and there's no funds in my account. Just trying to prepare for every situation and be financially smart.

personalfinance,"I have a fair amount of student loans, could consolidation help pay things off faster? Do I even have a chance to consolidate?","Hey /r/personalfinance, ~~I feel like this is going to be a pretty fast question.~~ (Edit: Just realized after typing all this out that I said ""fast question""....nope. :( ) Note for future reference, at the bottom of this post I've included a link to unbury.us that includes all of the relevant loans here.

Basically, between the loans in my name, and the parent plus loans in my mom's name, I have 125k student loan debt.  Now this isn't a post whining about how to pay this off with an art degree... I'm making enough in my first job that between my mother and myself we're capable of paying the minimum payments plus an extra ~$500.  (This is also going to go up soon, got a one year retention bonus raise early, but I haven't seen how much extra the bonus is going to be in normal paychecks yet.  Expect another $400-$500)

My question, is if loan consolidation might be an option to consider to get the loans paid faster - I've tried reading up on interest rates and consolidation, but just ended up somewhat confused.  My understanding is that if we consolidated the federal loans together through the government's consolidation option, the interest rate would be a straight weighted average of the loans' rates.  Doing the calculations myself, I think the interest rate would be 6.625%.  Could this be better than paying the loans seperately? The majority of the debt (like 70% of it) is at a higher interest rate, but the some of the other loans are at half that, ~3%.  I can't figure out what outweighs what here.

Okay, and besides that, there are of course consolidation options via banks, etc;  I'm starting out here by talking to someone at a Wells Fargo branch tomorrow, but if anyone has better options or comments I'd love to hear them.  Also, this may be the most important questions, would I even be able to consolidate this amount of loans? Or would I have to just stick with consolidating the smaller chunk that is in my name? Getting a single bulk loan from a servicer for 125k seems like a steep task to me.  As far as my credit scores, I just paid for an Equifax subscription today to verify it: Equifax = 693 (Good) | TransUnion = 696 (Good) | Experian = 693 (Good).  The worst thing on my report right now as far as I can see is that my account age / credit history isn't the longest, being somewhat fresh out of college - I graduated May 2014.

Anyway, assuming the loans could be consolidated, the main reason I was thinking it might be worthwhile would be if more $$$ could go to the principle of the loan.  Am I correct in assuming that if the interest on the consolidated loan is low enough, and given that we'll be paying as much as we can even if the minimum payments are lower, less of the payment will end up going to accruing interest?

Sorry if my info / questions seem somewhat convoluted, I'm not even sure how much questions I just asked....I've been trying to figure this stuff out for hours now and its getting late...

personalfinance,Start investing in an index fund or use that money to pay into our mortgage?,"Hi personalfinance,

This is the first time I've ever posted a discussion topic - so please go easy. 

The short version is that I want to start investing in an index fund through Vanguard (Australia) just putting little bits in each pay (probably $100/fortnight) now to give myself as much time as possible for the interest to compound etc., however my wife and I are also starting to build a house. Should I start investing in an index fund now, or should I put that money towards my mortgage? 

My reasoning is that an index fund should give higher ROI on average (9-10%) than the mortgage interest rate (~5%), but because the index fund amount will be small, I don't know if that will be outweighed by the much larger mortgage amount. It's a tradeoff between getting the mortgage paid off earlier/paying less interest over the term and starting the process of compounding interest rolling.

The more detailed stats are:

* Had 20% deposit on the land value, but ~10% of the total borrowing amount.

* Mortgage amount will be about $435k @ 4.8% interest (variable rate). We have the option to fix an amount and keep part of it variable, but we can only pay additional amounts off the variable part - this might be another question later. The mortgage package gives us an interest rate discount, has offset accounts and we can pay additional amounts off it whenever we choose.

* As we are building, we currently only have the mortgage for the land itself. Construction is due to start in a couple of weeks, after which time the bank will incrementally increase our mortgage amount as the builders complete each stage as set out in the contract. As a result, our payments now are reasonably low (so we've been trying to put more towards it, though there are a couple of unforeseen expenses that have come up and expenses we are planning to meet when we move in i.e. landscaping, window coverings that were not part of the building contract).

* My wife and I only really have our HECS debts, which (currently) is essentially an interest free loan which is paid off through PAYG income taxes. So no need to pay those back any sooner than necessary.

* My current income is about $70k AUD and my wife's is about $55k (though hers should increase once she completes her development year). We are both reasonably good at budgeting, saving and avoiding unnecessary spending.

Any other details you need, please ask me. Appreciate any advice anyone offers.

personalfinance,Questions about being garnished,"Here's the long version detailing all my bad decisions that led to my current position:

Back in 2010 I was working for a company that offered the ability to move to different locations once a year.  I was working in New Mexico and some things came up and I wanted to be closer to some family in California so I could help them out.  There was a location in Southern California, so after talking to my supervisor and HR I worked out a plan to go to California for a year and help out family and then eventually transfer back.  After that year is over I started to work on the transfer process to go back to New Mexico and was eventually told it was denied.  I couldn't get any answers out of them as to why, they just said it was denied and I could try again in 6 months.  I didn't really make enough money to continue living in California  as I was already chewing through my savings. After discussing it with my then girlfriend, now wife, we decided that I would quit my job, move back to New Mexico and go to school for Engineering.  The biggest concern was my debt at the time.  I had a car I was still making payments on and a credit card with about $4000 on it.  Things would be pretty tight, but we figured with any left over financial aid we could swing it. 
            
Now, before I had left to go to California I was trying to go to school at UNM.  I tried going to UNM at two different semesters. Once in 2007 and again 2009.  In the middle of the first attempt I had a great opportunity at work to move to nights and make a 20% differential, but that would conflict with my morning classes at school.  I was only taking 2 at the time, but I decided it was worth and it decided I would just go back to school next semester.  I was most of the way through the semester and I didn't know any better at the time and I just stopped going, thinking it wouldn't make a difference anyway.  I didn't realize there was a thing called dropping and this was obviously a very bad choice.  In 2009 I was ready to try and go to school again and a friend had told me about correspondence courses that the university offered.  I thought it was a great idea because at my job I didn't really do a whole lot at night and would have plenty of time to do school work, so I signed up for some correspondence courses.  Fast Forward 8 months and I had ultimately done none of the work and the classes were almost over.  I dropped the classes and realized I made yet another bad decision, but I wasn't too worried because I had a good job that I liked.

After I came back from California we had decided that I would focus my efforts full time on school since I had a record of making bad decisions and doing poorly when trying to do both.  As my first year progressed I was doing good in school, but it was becoming increasingly more difficult to keep up with my finances.  I called the credit card company and we worked out a 6 month payment plan that would lower the interest rate and my payments and hopefully get me back on track.  The payment plan required me to setup autopay which I was fine with me.  After a few months I everything seemed to be going better, I saw on the statements that the payment plan was applied as discussed and it was coming out of my account on time and I stopped worrying about it.  Fast Forward about a year and I started receiving collection notices from a company I was unfamiliar with.  After doing some research it turned out that 6 months after setting up my payment plan and that payment plan was done, the credit card company stopped the autopay.  In my stupidity and thinking everything was going fine I was no longer checking my credit card statements because I assumed it was being taken out every month and the account had been closed so I wasn't expecting any new charges, so I didn't realize the account was falling behind.  I had also recently changed my phone number from a California area code back to a New Mexico area code so my phone number with them wasn't up to date.  6 months after the autopay stopped I got written off and sent to collections.  

At this point I had to make a choice to either drop out of school and get a job to get my finances current or just accept that my credit was now gone and move forward with school and get it taken care of when I eventually graduate.  I was attending the local community college at the time and their high level math/science classes weren't very flexible.  There was only ever one offered and they were typically in the middle of the day, so it was really an option to hope to do both.  Ultimately it was decided that I was doing good in school and would continue with that and take care of my credit when I graduated and got a job. 

Like most people who are getting constant calls and mail from collectors I just started ignoring it and went on with my life.  I figured I didn't have a job and couldn't pay them any money and telling them that isn't going to change anything.  Through financial aid and my Wife's income we had managed to pay my car off and things were got a little more comfortable for the time being.  Then last night I was checking the balance on my checking account and noticed it was at exactly $0, which was odd because she had just got paid that day.  After contacting the bank it turns out it was due to a garnishment.  I got a number from the bank to contact, but since it's the weekend I haven't really been able to do that yet, though I don't expect to hear any exciting news.  This obviously puts me in a pretty bad spot only 3 days from the end of the month and while I have some family I can turn to for help, I'm wondering about what to do for the immediate future.  

***TLDR: made bad choices with finances and got my checking account garnished down to $0

My current plan is to get a job after this semester and just put off school for a year and get my finances current, but I can't really start at any new job until the middle of may.  Unfortunately I can't really put it off by only a semester because the Electrical Engineering program at UNM offers certain classes in fall/spring, so if I miss a semester those classes won't be offered again until the following fall.  My wife wants to see if we can get that money back since it was technically her earnings and I had that debt before I married her.  I don't suspect there is anything that can be done about the money they've already taken since it was taken from a joint account and I assume the state has no problem with them taking the entirety of our checking account or it wouldn't have happened, but I have some questions on what to expect in the near future.


Are they going to 0 out the balance every time we put any sort of money in the account?

If my wife opens up a new checking account by herself at a different bank will they garnish that account too since we're married? (even though her name was never on the credit card)

When I get a job should I expect my first check to start getting garnished as well?",finance,1427552694

Interest Rate: 4.66% Fixed

I have about $2000 left from the loan that was unused. I want to use these $2000 in the smartest way possible. Of course I can just put it all into one payment immediately but is there any way I can do this so it will help my credit too? For example, paying a fixed amount of money every month from the $2000.

politics,A brief history of RFRA and how we got to where we are,"For background, by ""how we got to where we are,"" I'm talking about Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act. ([Here's a recent /r/politics discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/30jnvw/apple_boss_disappointed_by_new_indiana_religious/).) That law is loosely based on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA. Whether RFRA is bad law or not, that's up to you. But either way, you should know its weird history. It starts with the War on Drugs.

In the late 1980s, a pair of Native American guys in Oregon tried to do two seemingly incompatible things. First, they were working as drug counselors. Second, they took peyote. Both guys were fired from their jobs, which is understandable and, if it ended there, so likely would the story. But when they applied for unemployment benefits, the state rejected their claim, finding that they were fired for on-the-job misconduct. The pair appealed, arguing that their should be an exception, as peyote use was part of a religious ceremony. The Oregon courts agreed, but the Supreme Court didn't. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority ([Wikipedia link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_Division_v._Smith#Majority_opinion)), concluded -- likely correctly, for what it's worth -- that the First Amendment didn't protect their actions.

Well, everyone went nuts after that. And I mean everyone. Civil libertarians saw this as both an overreach in the drug war *and* an assault on the 1st Amendment, and if you think about it, just about all major politicians, left or right, are going to agree with at least half of that. Enter RFRA. Under RFRA, a law isn't valid (as applied to the believer) unless it (a) furthers a compelling governmental interest *and* (b) is the least-restrictive way to to further that interest. (As an aside: if you want to know why Hobby Lobby won their Supreme Court a few months back, part (b) was a major part. The Affordable Care Act has a less-restrictive solution for religious non-profits, and there's little reason why that provision couldn't apply to companies like Hobby Lobby.) That's a much wider standard than the 1st Amendment, and almost certainly would have meant that the two men in Oregon kept their unemployment benefits (but, note, they'd likely still have lost their jobs).

Anyway, RFRA became law pretty easily. The House passed it acclamation, and its main sponsor was a Democrat, Chuck Schumer (who is now a Senator). The Senate passed it by a 97-3 vote, and the most notable no-vote was Republican Jesse Helms, who feared that the protections would apply to inmates. Bill Clinton signed it into law. 

Nearly immediately, legal scholars predicted that it would spin out of control. Marci Hamilton, the leading scholar on the issue, has a site at http://rfraperils.com/ which explains all of it, but the basic idea is that the federal RFRA law caused a weird cultural shift. Instead of fixing bad laws like the one which ensnared the peyote users, legislative branches started instituting state-level RFRAs as catch-all. Over time, those have expanded to exclude all sorts of things which have nothing to do with the original problem of two guys who didn't get their unemployment benefits.

It's a really bad result regardless if whether you agree with Indiana's law, because it's a result that creeps up on you. If the original law at the time of the peyote users' case was simply less Draconian, we'd likely never have got here.",cryptocurrency,1427554409

personalfinance,A bit of success,"In January of this year, I first came to this sub. I had no understanding of my finances or debt. I had a credit card with 16% interest carrying a balance of 8.4K that would kick in money to my IRA and another credit card with 11% interest carrying 2K. I have a car payment and a house payment.

This morning, I checked the  highest interest rate credit card and it showed a zero balance for the first time in years! That is going to be hundreds of dollars of saved interest over this year. I can now move on to paying off the lower interest rate card and then the car. 

The two big steps I took included first figuring out my financial situation. I made a spreadsheet to track my expenses and figure out where all the needless spending was going. I also examined my debt for size and interest. The second thing I did was make a budget and a plan for paying off the debt. Seeing it and understanding it gave me power over it. The budget is still being fine tuned as there were some surprise expenses (the risk of setting up auto payments for non-necessary services).

The biggest areas in which I saved money included eating out (minimized), food (no shopping when hungry or on impulse), phone, miscellaneous (lots of impulse buying here), and credit card interest. Again, measuring it allowed me to manage it. I am able to make a list of new areas to save money each month by examining the previous month expenses -because I understand them. 

One of my best moves was to switch phone service to Ting. My family's monthly phone bill dropped from $145/month to $25!

personalfinance,401k with higher expense ratios vs a taxable account with lower expense ratios,"I made a post a while back asking some general questions, but I now have more specific ones.

Basically, I am going to receive about $150k, possibly a little more, possibly less, but almost certainly more than the combined maximum limit of my 401k and Roth IRA combined. This leaves me with two choices:

1. Max out my IRA and 401k just for this year, then invest the rest in the market in a taxable account right now, and pay taxes as it grows, but get low expense ratios (Using Vanguard). Taking out money every year for my IRA would pretty heavily cut into returns, so I can't do that.

2. Store the money somewhere that will provide the best interest rate (which will still be low) and invest the money gradually into my 401k (Target retirement 2055 with 1% expense ratio) and Roth IRA

I make $52k/yr before taxes and get an employer match up to 50% of 10%, meaning option 2 would involve investing $18,300/yr, freeing up an additional $5500/yr that would otherwise have gone into my IRA, for spending or short term savings

I plan to use total market index funds, so returns before taxes and expense ratios should be the same. Do the low expense ratios make up for the taxes? Are the taxes less than I'd be losing from missed returns and inflation? Are there other issues I haven't thought of?

Need: My friend owes a lot of money (at least $100,000) between a mix of credit cards and personal loans (friends) that he racked up while starting a business. He wants to pay these all off and just have one payment to make each month.

Income: He has now abandoned the business and is working at a salary of $150,000 (programmer) and his wife could be joint on any loan with her salary of about $75,000 (government). So $225,000 combined annual income.

Credit: He has limited credit history in America, he left behind terrible credit in Canada. His wife has average to good credit, she has never been missing payments but does still have some student loans. Her parents have a lot of equity in their home, and great credit but they DO NOT want to put anything against the parents home, and would really prefer to not drag the parents into this.

Assets: Very little. A car, maybe a small retirement account for the wife.

Important note: He is making scheduled payments to the IRS after not paying taxes for several years. He spoke with a tax specialist and I believe has a deal worked out making a fixed payment until it's paid off.
They are recently married and the wife is trying to clean up his huge mess of debt.

Which banks are easier to qualify for unsecured debt? What is required? What would the interest rates be like? Can the debt be amortized over 5 years? 10 years? Do loans allow additional payments without penalty (if he wants to apply his Christmas bonus to pay down some principal).

I currently max my 401k at work and then put money I have left over after that into a vanguard S&amp;P index. No debt currently, which seems overly conservative and inefficient.   
  
  
Situation:  
Lately I have been thinking about buying a 1 bedroom condo in Williamsburg or Battery Park City (I doubt I could afford other desirable downtown Manhattan neighborhoods) for $500-800k to take advantage of low interest rates, tax deduction and reduce some exposure to stock market. The mortgage would be about $1500-3000 (pretax) per month plus common charges which can be $1k or so at the high end.  But I am worried about being locked into high fixed costs every month.    
  
  
What do you think?   
  
  
Concerns:   
- There is a lot of new building going on so I am slightly worried about prices falling  
- If interest rates go up, expensive condos would probably fall in price hard  
- If I lost my job and couldn't find another one I would be in trouble  
- If I get transferred to London or HK or something I would have to rent it out which could be a huge headache  
- If I get married or my needs change I could have a problem

personalfinance,Is an interest only mortgage a good idea for my situation?,"I am thinking about an interest only mortgage, because I have student loan debt that has higher interest rates than the mortgage. If for example my current student loan payment is $300 a month and will go away in 10 years when the loan is paid off(sooner if I pay more than $300 a month), and my mortgage will go up $300 a month after 10 years too, it seems to make sense to me. Questions though:

1. Is an ARM a good idea? I don't want the adjustable rate to shoot up in a few years.
2. Can I refinance as soon as the interest only 10 year period is up to a low fixed rate?
3. Is this stupid?

personalfinance,"Could pay cash for a car, but leveraging 1.49% financing on some of it would allow me to pay off higher interest rate student loans. Is this a good idea?","I recently sold a car I was making payments on. The $400 monthly payment was well within my budget, but with $10,000 cash budgeted to be on hand (after paying off the lien) I should be able to buy something basic yet reliable to fit my needs... instead of my wants with the previous car. I'd like to build up my emergency savings further, and begin investing for the future.

The only debts I have are student loans. I graduated in December of 2008, and began paying these back the following June. Using minimum payments (Yes I know, but my income used to be hit or miss) I'm on track to pay everything off in June of 2019. These are the remaining loan balances with their interest rates.


6.80% - $552.27

6.00% - $1364.93

5.25% - $1300.83

4.80% - $2465.39

4.80% - $1703.25

4.80% - $794.37

3.75% - $1286.10

Total - $9467.14

My monthly payment on these are $218.90 with 50 months left.

My questions is, are there any reasons not to borrow say $5,000 for the car at 1.49% interest, and only put $5,000 down cash? The remaining $5,000 could knock out my 6.8%, 6%. 5.25%, and a chunk of my 4.8% loans.

For the 1.49% interest rate I'd need to have a maximum loan payment time of 36 months, but increasing my monthly payment (regardless of using the auto loan to help) isn't a problem for my budget.

I'd love the thoughts and opinions of others on doing this. Since I plan on paying the loans down faster regardless are there any downsides here? Would the interest saved be worthwhile?

Also, with the lien I realize I have to carry full coverage insurance, but I would already be doing this.

TL;DR - Should I use a 1.49% auto loan rate to use less cash on a vehicle to in turn pay off higher interest student loans?",finance,1427573406

- Just lost my job (end of Feb), been issued a severance ($12-13k). 
- I've decided to go back to school in september ($5700/year tuition and books)
- I own my home (valued by proximity to similar sales to be around $320k-329k)
- Sale price 2010 was $309k ($316k after tax)
- My mortgage remaining is $~190k (I had sizable equity to put down at point of sale)
- If I sell my home, my estimated remaining equity would be $129k without subtracting realtor fees and land transfer tax etc.
- Current mortgage payments ($468 A. Bi-Weekly)
- Interest rate 4.29% slated for renewal in July of this year
- Strata fees $210/month
- Property Tax $1700/year (after primary residence rebate)
- Location: Nanaimo, BC (Canada)
- For all intents and purposes, it is considered a ""Nice"" house.
- I am single and have a roommate who contributes $550/month
- I have no other income streams.

I've got three situations i'm looking for input on:

(1) If I should sell my house and use the equity accrued to purchase a much cheaper house to live in ($145k) while going back to school and perhaps find roommates to rent rooms and live there basically for free while earning an income of $~500 a month to live on? 

I have found a property that would cost $134k leaving me with a mortgage of $12k-20k ($89.20/month over a 25 year amortization with a 5 year fixed rate of 2.49%) It is three bedrooms with 1080 sq.ft so I'd earn ~450/month per room on average ($900/month income). Over a 9 month school year that nets $8100 in rental income. Covering my cost of living (rent-free) as well as taking care of property taxes ($~450/year after primary res. deduct) and strata fees $230/month. This would also contribute heavily to paying for the cost of school every year. It is 3 blocks from the university next to a shopping center and on a major bus route. 

The challenge I need to come to terms with is that the building is 40 years old (built 1975). There was a recent assessment levied on the owners of $18k each to repair structural damage in the crawlspace. The unit in question apparently was not one of the problem units and will have no work done on it. 


(2) If I should take the $110-120k in equity and invest it with the purpose of earning more than a standard rental unit in Nanaimo would cost ($500-750)/month. This would be a short term investment as the duration of the investment would be matched with my time spent at school (4 years). At the high end of the spectrum ($750/month or $9000/year), that would be ~8-9% return annually. 

(3) Rent out my current property for $~1400-1550/month to cover mortgage, property tax and strata fees. 
The property would cost me $1261/month at current strata rate and a new interest rate of 2.46% over 5 years fixed (25 year amortization period).

Renting it out at the low end ($1400/month) would earn me $139/month. If I went this route, how much should I put aside in an emergency fund for financing repairs to a property such as this. Strata covers everything exterior.

personalfinance,Budget advice please,"Hi PF, I'm a long time lurker, first time poster and am looking for some financial advice. I just paid of my credit card for the first time in a couple years (though I haven't paid interest in over a year).  I've been recovering from some expensive health issues, being in several good friends wedding parties, a family emergency, several months of unemployment before this job, and some poor choices. I've worked really hard on my budget and plan, but I'm still going to be in debt until 2020 and want to contribute to a wedding / kids etc before then. I have a relatively stable federal government job that I've now been in for three years and I've increased my salary 50% over that time. But feel like I need a much larger e-fund because I won't even be able to cover one month on my current cash savings. I spend hours obsessing over this stuff each week (at least 30 min a day) but I'd like to automate it all and put it aside mentally because I recognize that's not super healthy. I'm hoping you can help me optimize my plan.

**Overall**

*Debts:*

* Medical debt $2,750 (min $127/m, interest free if paid each month)
* TSP (retirement) loan $3,500 (min $80/month 2% interest to self)
* Student loans just under $125,000:

* lender a $52,100 (1.5-2% interest, 315 min payment)
* lender b $36,800 (1.5-2% interest, 225 min payment)
* lender c $32,000 (gov, 4.5-6.5% interest, 686 min payment -- could reduce too $400 in case of emergency)
* lender d $3,000 (private, 5% interest, $82 min) 


*Assets:*

* E-fund $2,150 - growing through $500 a month savings starting in April, with a third paycheck in July, planning to get to $9k by December
* TSP Roth $7,500 (principal) I could cash the principal out if I lost my job with no tax hit, but if I took money out now I'd lose my match
* Traditional TSP and Roth earnings $10,500

**Monthly**

*Paycheck:*

* Pre-tax HSA $98 (this takes forever to reimburse but I'm planning to use to pay extra towards the medical debt)
* Retirement loan $150 (could be less,  I chose $150 because then I have $1000 going to retirement per month with my match)
* Retirement contribution (before 100% match - maxing out match) $425
* Cash to me $4715

*Expenses:*

* Charity $100 (this is important to me ethically)
* Rent $1200 (major metro area, paying part of partner's mortgage but less than I paid for a studio before, I don't expect to be a non-equity partner forever :)
* Utilities/phone $200 (usually runs less, but with winter heat can be this high)
* Student loans $2015 (min. is $1250, I'm paying all the extra to knock out lender d by July, then will apply to lender c)
* Savings $500
* Everything else (food, transport, clothes, toiletries, cat, etc) $500 (partner covers fun stuff, like travel and fancy meals)
* Medical debt $127 (more than the min)

So I have $73 left, and could free up $70 by reducing my TSP loan payments. I also have some extra utility money sometimes. This is the first time I've had extra cash in my budget in years! Where do I put this? Medical debt, TSP loan, student loan, or savings?  Is there anything else I should be doing differently?

Bitcoin,We need a standard for Bitcoin blockchain timestamps! Proposal Inside! Feedback please!,"Dear Bitcoiners and Bitcoinerettes

I have recently found great interest in using the Bitcoin blockchain for secure and trustless timestamping. This interest was mainly raised as I would have loved to have proof of certain data I and others produced in the past. I am not in the situation to need the proof now, but It could have come in handy one day. I previously asked on reddit about advice regarding creation of an email plugin which would keep timestamps for all my emails. I imagined this plugin to timestamp based on certain filter criteria.

The reactions on reddit were quite negative: Too expensive, too much bloat, blockchain spam. At the time I was discouraged and let it slip away as it seemed unfeasible.

  

I started to study the current implementations and services and created this overview:

[Bitcoin Blockchain Timestamping Overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rTxK5sVsktBYkwFZH6TLWKN7FTBXDuN2G1ePED6Rscg/edit?usp=sharing)

I have no affiliation with any of these and I have also not tried all of these services!

  

After studying these concepts which I found, I came to several conclusions:

* There is no Bitcoin blockchain timestamping standard so far. Every implementation is somewhat different.
* There are some methods which are susceptible to pruning. These might have a problem in the future.
* There are some methods which use more space in the blockchain than others. Bloat is of course not desired.

  

I think we are in need of a standard which will be used more often. Only if we have a standard which lots of users follow, Bitcoin timestamps can be widely used and accepted. Just imagine a court case where someone claims to have such a timestamp. Technical experts will have to be called in to state that this is in fact as close to proof as it gets that the timestamp was in fact made prior to date X. Now if everyone does it differently, everyone will have to pay for their own experts and it will take much longer until these timestamps are accepted plus it will overall be more expensive to get them accepted, if there are several predominant types. If we follow a standard these timestamps could get a certain credibility amongst non-technical people and would be accepted much faster.

  

So what would be ideal requirements for such a standard?

* No blockchain bloat
* Minimal data which has to be stored along with the document or document’s hash.
* Make use of standard crypto operations
* No need to run a full node or be mining in order to make a timestamp
* Client side hashing of the data to make the level of privacy configurable by the user.
* Not susceptibility to pruning
* Timestamp validity can be checked immediately by participant. Immediate client side verification.

  

From these requirements I figured the following concept would be best:

* Document’s SHA-256 hash is created.
* Other Document’s SHA- 256 hashes are collected (3^rd party, self or both)
* A Merkle tree is created out of all the collected hashes.
* The top hash is RIPE160ed and made directly into an address (add prepend version, checksum, Base58 encode)
* A single Satoshi is sent to the address
* TX hash is fed back (or kept in case of self) to user.
* Together with the TX hash the Merkle tree branch is fed back (and/or kept in case of self) to the user.

  

To verify A timestamp one needs the following:

* Original data (SHA-245 hash can be derived)
* Bitcoin transaction hash (block number can be derived)
* Merkle tree branch

  

Actually it was /u/sipa who pointed me to ChronoBit (in the list linked above) and making use of of Merkle trees to reduce bloat. My proposal as pointed out above derives from the concept of CronoBit in that it still creates a transaction. However, it borrows the concept of the hash tree from CronoBit and I guess from Bitcoin itself too ;-)

While ChronoBit is fully p2p and decentralized it bears the problem that you either need to be mining on p2p-pool yourself, or rely on others to be mining for you. The timestamps are somewhat limited to blocks found by p2p-pool. It is elegant as you have a direct connection to the block hash and no additional transactions are needed.

  

I am look at using a one Satoshi transaction for x timestamps is like forging a little unspendable colored coin which serves as anchor point for many timestamp participants.

A single stamper (private or service) can literally create thousands of timestamps in a daily transaction. The client must store a little bit more data compared to single timestamp models. That is not an awful lot of data even for thousands of documents; e.g. 1500 digits proof per document (including some identifiers) would suffice to join forces and have 250’000 timestamps in one transaction.

  

I guess the standard needs to be as flexible as possible. The format must be similar to PGP signatures or so. Something like: {document’s hash; transaction hash, Merkle tree branch depth, Merkle tree branch hashes, claimed blocktime of verified block}

  

I like the concept because it would enable a fully dynamic level of self crated Merkle tree and service created Merkle tree. Can either be done on top of own full Bitcoin node, or with a service. If a service is used the hash tree can still be continued. The service can do nothing but fool you for some minutes. There are no privacy issues as only hashes are sent in the first place. After the service created and sent the proof, it can vanish without the timestamp being lost for the user; 3^rd party trust will not be a critical thing for most users.

  

I also want to discuss the way the address is created in my proposal above. Some current implementations create a private key first and then derive the address from it. This makes the transacted Satoshi potentially prunable. Someone could spend it with the private key which is commonly known. I want that Satoshi stuck forever.

  

With this scheme I think it would be feasible to timestamp as many emails and documents as I want without having huge costs and the bloat is somewhat justifiable...

  

After your valued feedback I would like to try to put together a paper and some kind of demo implementation.

Best regards and thanks for reading.

Things which are not entirely clear to me:

* Transaction hashes, malleability and if it matters in this context.
* More methods/services for timestamping if you know of any.
* I did read that some miners do not include OP_RETURN transactions any more. How likely is it that this will become a problem in the future?

**My Debt:**

* $15,700 in student loans - I just got my student loans out of default, yay! I'm currently making on time payments. Interest rates range from 5 - 6.8% on 5 loans.
* $2,900 left to pay on my car, but it needs about $1k in repairs/maintenance (tires, brakes, etc). My payments are currently on time and it's the only good credit that I have. The interest rate is awful (17%) but at least I only have 9 months left to pay on it.
* $1,500 in broken leases/apts that charged me a bunch of money for cleaning the place when I moved out. 
* $1,000 in medical debt.
* $1,250 in other debts (utilities, cable companies, etc).

**His Debt:**

* $4,600 for one broken lease from about a year ago. I called the collection agency today and they said they can't do a settlement but they may be able to set up payment arrangements. 
* $1,400 in credit card debt.
* $1,100 in other debts (utlities, cable companies, etc.)
* $2,200 in medical debt.

Collectively, we owe around $31,500. Almost all of it, except his apartment debt and my car, is from about 5-6 years ago. 

**What We Have**

We're bringing in about $2100/month. We have about $1650 in expenses each month. My school loan and car payments are finally on track. We opened up a checking and savings account with a credit union 2 months ago and I've been using Mint to track our spending. We switched from cigarettes to eCigs (quitting cold turkey didn't go well). We finally have health insurance again (thanks, Obama). We have $300 in savings. We have no credit cards. 

**What We Want**

We currently live in a tiny town and they don't pay worth a damn out here. We want to move back to the city. I'm estimating that our expenses (after moving) would go up to about $2500/month, but our income would almost double ($3800-$4500/month). The move would allow us to pay our debts off much, much faster. It seems like a smart move, I just don't know how to get us there, or where the fuck to start.

Basically, I filed exemptions of 1 for federal and 2 for state. My federal return shows I get a refund of about $200, but owe $1400 state.


When I first got my job in NYC, I was living in NJ, and I filed my W-4 with that home address in mind. My best guess is that I should have updated my W-4 when I moved to the city.
So, 2 questions: 

1. Is there a specific place to fill in on my W-4 (or any form) which would specify some money to set aside for the NYC taxed? I had assumed this was lumped into my state withholding but this doesn't seem to be the case.


2. If I owe ~$1400 in state taxes, is it possible for me to apply for a payment plan? I could pay this back in about 6 weeks, but I do not have the lump payment right now. Is there a large fee associate with a payment plan (if it exists)?


Thanks for any help. I am somewhat bummed since my recent raise is being negated by my failure to properly file my taxes last yet. I just want to be re-pay this.",finance,1427593901
personalfinance,I need unbiased guidance regarding student loans,"I (a senior in high school) recently had a meeting with a counselor at my college of interest. After scholarships and grants, there is still $5,530.00 of tuition (per year) left to pay. I was approved for a federal unsubsidized loan of $5,500.00, which would be taken out in my name and, by my understanding, would accrue interest all through my schooling. The counselor and my mom seemed all too eager to have me take out the full loan amount because it would ""help my credit."" 

My main fear is that I'll graduate college with a crazy amount of debt and not have a job to pay it off with. I'm more afraid of that than I am excited to go to college. 

My question is, is it logical to take out that amount of money at 18? I currently have no job, though I plan to work through college and have begun filling out applications. If I should take out the loan, what should I know about federal unsubsidized loans? Do I need to pay the interest monthly throughout the school year? If you were 18 and knew what you know now, what would you do? 

Any advice is appreciated.",finance,1427597211
personalfinance,"Moved in 2013, 2014 two W-2's for different states???","I got put on temporary assignment from VA to NY in 2013. July to December of 2013 I was in NY. 

In January of 2014 I officially became permanent in NY. 

I received 2 W-2's this year, which makes no sense to me. 

What makes less sense is, that the NY one lists the federal wages and state wages, but the VA one only lists state info. All the top boxes are blank. But the weird thing is the wages on my VA state one is much less, as in about 7% less. But the state income tax paid is almost all on the VA side. I paid a total of about 5% state income tax, but according to my NY W-2, only about only about 8% of that was paid in NY. 

That makes NO sense to me because I was a resident in NY the ENTIRE year of 2014, and became a permanent employee in NY in mid January of 2014. 

My employer is based in VA, but I didn't think that would make any difference.

personalfinance,Thoughts on how to deal with what will be a significant student debt while in a Ph.D. program.,"Just for some back ground. I am in a pharmacy program currently, meaning when I graduate I could begin work and make avg 100k/yr ($90,000, conservatively). However, I plan on progressing into a Ph.D. program in three years, which will be fully paid for, cover my insurance, provide an option for subsidized housing, and give me a $30,000 stipend. Figure with my clinical degree I could pick up floating shifts at $60-70/hr, but probably won't have the time to work *that* much. By the end of my clinical program I will have accrued ~100k in loans. I currently have approximately $10,000 invested in precious metals, and $5,000 in cash (though that is largely from my student loans to pay for food, housing, and incidentals). What would be my best way to progress into my Ph.D. program while dealing with my loans and providing myself with a modest (yet comfortable) standard of living? If I have read the literature correctly, I don't technically have to pay back my federal loans until 6 months after I finish; would this mean I am technically liberated from being forced to make payments while in my Ph.D. program? (I Know this isn't a good idea, but if I'm in a financial position where I can't afford that month's payment, I'd rather it have not been obligatory)

TL;DR: currently 21; in 3 years expenses will be: 100k loan, housing; income: 30,000k stipend for Ph.D., possible $60-70/hr per diem work as pharmacist. looking for advice on setting myself up so when I have to cope with this I won't have to eat beans out of a can for 4 years straight.",finance,1427599278
personalfinance,It looks like I'm going to have to take out a title loan on my car. Can anyone help fill me in on the process and how to minimize the chances of me getting completely screwed? (If possible),"I'm currently settling in my new city (Denver) after the most hectic year of my life. I've had to move states three times and my savings are gone. Like, gone-gone, grand total of about $14 to my name right now. I'd moved out here to Colorado about 14 months ago, had trouble getting work and personal issues came up so I moved back to Illinois, where I was able to find a job in my field, but before too long things were going horrible there so I ended up coming back to (a different town in) Colorado. 

Luckily, I found work the week I got here! Yay! I don't start until the 6th, though, and in the meantime I need money to eat, get some work essentials, pay for my fingerprints to be taken, &amp; my occupational badge (I work in an industry that requires everyone be badged by the state.) so I'm going to have to take out some kind of loan to get by until then, about $500-650 would do it and my car is all I have of value, really. 

My car is worth about $5k, I believe, and most the title loan sites are saying they can estimate max loan amounts at ~$2,500. I need far less Han that, though, but they aren't giving me much info on if I can do that, how long I can take the loan out for, interest rates, etc. I'm assuming because they want to get me in the door and pressure me to sign a high interest loan with shady terms. Can anyone help me not get hosed? I've never done anything like this before. 

What's normal interest? Should I go to a place in town or look online? Anyone have a company they'd recomrnd for this? Is there anyone but normal title loan places that will do this or would a bank or something? 


Any help or advice is appreciated. Thanks!!",finance,1427601696
personalfinance,Unsure what to do about a very old student loan.,"Some years ago, say... 9 years ago, I made the extremely foolish decision to attend ITT technical institute. I had to take out a ton of loans to afford it, as they wanted ~$40,000 for the whole degree plan.

I went there for one (maybe two, it has been a while) quarter and came to the realization that the recruiter who had convinced me to sign on had outright lied to me about what degree I'd be getting, even though I had noticed a discrepancy between the listed classes and the ones I wanted, right down to the name of the degree plan... And was assured that I was in fact signing on for X degree. In reality, that branch of the school didn't even offer that degree, so I noped out. Immediately.

The majority of the loan money (to which I never had access - the entirety of it was paid directly to ITT; I never personally saw a dime) was returned whence it came. At the time, Sallie Mae was handling my student loans, of which I had taken two different types - Federal and private.

These loans are now handled by Navient. Two of these loans are Federal Stafford Loans, and I know I am not getting out of them. At any rate, these loans are not negatively affecting me (apart from the eventual financial commitment of paying them back), because I am a full-time student and the loans are therefore in deferment. Beyond that, the sum of these loans is relatively small, only a couple of thousand dollars.


The OTHER loan is a private loan, described as ""College Advantage -####"" in the loan summary. The last time I made a payment on this loan was 03/06/2012, so 3 years ago. I have attempted to speak with Navient about the fact that I am a full time student, and unemployed, and not in a position to make payments on this loan currently and at any rate, I had always been under the impression that being enrolled part time or more meant automatic deferment. I was informed that this no longer applied to the private loan.



I have been told by some that in the case of these private lenders, they can report against my credit (which is already in the toilet), but cannot do much more than that. They have threatened to do various nasty things to me in the past, I ignored them, and as yet nothing has happened except that they  keep calling me and every number I've ever had and every person I've ever known. I've heard of people in my situation who have tried to do the ""right"" thing and pay back the loans and have gotten screwed for it, and advised that the best thing to do is ignore them and 7 years from the last time I made a payment, there's nothing they can do anymore.


I really don't know what to do in this situation; I have more than enough debt to worry about with the loans I currently have applied to my actually useful and real degree from a real school. 



So that's all the details, I guess the TLDR is ""Can the people holding the private loans actually do anything to me?""",finance,1427608889

personalfinance,"Filed Business Taxes, Received Refund, but Then Received Two 1099s in the Mail. What to do?","Hi /r/personalfinance.  You've come to my rescue in the past and I'm hoping you can again!  Here's the situation: 

I ran a solo practice law firm in 2014.  The firm is a single-member LLC that I operated under my SSN--I had no employees.  Because I moved around a lot in 2014, I had to file state taxes in NY, CT, and NC (NC is where I reside now).  Using my monthly and annual profit &amp; loss statements, I filed my taxes using TurboTax.  My returns included an accurate reporting of all my income and expenses.  Here's the wrinkle: 

After filing my state and federal returns, I received two 1099s in the mail that I didn't expect.  The first 1099 is from a client of mine and it's for $650.  I didn't claim or mention this 1099 anywhere on my taxes specifically, but the $650 in income was previously included in my tax returns (i.e., the $650 was included in my profit &amp; loss statement, which I used to prepare my tax returns).  

Then, I received a second 1099 for $34,973.82.  This one is a bit weird, because it's from a class action settlement administrator.  I typically charge a 25% contingency fee on these class action cases, so I only really received 25% of $34,973.82 (or $8,743).  Just like the previous 1099, I included the $8,743 in my P&amp;Ls, which I used to prepare my returns.  However, I didn't specifically address, claim, or mention this 1099 anywhere on my taxes.  

So, my questions: 

Do I need to file a set of amended returns to specifically address or mention these two 1099s somewhere?  Or am I okay with not filing amended returns because I claimed and paid tax on all the income already (the income from the two 1099s was already included in my gross revenues on my tax returns)?  If I don't file a set of amended returns, do I run an increased risk of audit?

personalfinance,Having trouble refinancing two rental properties.,"I have two houses I bought as rental properties when I was 21, about 12 years ago. I was the stereotypical sub-prime buyer. Despite the fact that I was only working part time on the weekends while attending college, the mortgages got greased through. For most of the time I have owned them they have been a money waste, but I got better over the years and now they at least rent for more than the mortgage + escrow, which is nice, but repairs usually put them in the red for years end.

The interest rates are 7.4% and 7.6%, the balances owed are $50k and $60k, and they are with America's Servicing Company (now a division of Wells Fargo) and Ocwen. I would like to refinance but none of the places that I have contacted are willing to do a refi on a property with less than $65k owed. I have enough money saved to pay off one, but not both and I would prefer to keep some of my money liquid anyways.

**Additional relevant info:**
* I am a PhD student now and survive on grant money, in Europe.  For clarity, I am a US citizen.
* My only income in the US comes from the rental income of these two properties.
* 791 transunion, 786 experian credit scores.
* I have searched the Freddie and Fannie sites to see if either is backed by them, and they are not.

Husband and I are late 20s, no kids, make $110,000 gross together. We started with about 70K in student loan debt (all federal), obviously this has shrunk as we have paid it off (he's been paying 5 years, I have been for one). Other debts include car (we owe just under 15k, we share a car) and credit cards from when we had less money and made some bad decisions (just over 8K). I made a budget, but I am afraid that because our housing cost will more than double and we are not used to the cost of being homeowners I am missing something.

We are currently renting a townhouse for $575, closing on a $135K townhouse in May. The P+I should not be much more with 10% down (3.875% fixed rate, 30 years) but with taxes and insurance the payment will be about $1200. Annual cost of those: $3600 taxes, $875 homeowner's and $1575 flood. We have about $27K saved so we obviously can't swing the 20% and pay closing costs, especially with all that upfront insurance cost so we will have PMI (about $45 per month).

personalfinance,21 Year Old Seeking Personal Finance Advice,"Hi guys, first post here on Reddit! Read the rules for the /r/personalfinance subreddit already - so hopefully I don't break any rules!

Anyway, as you can see from the title, I'm a young adult seeking to get my finances in order. I hope to get out of this post relevant and up-to-date info as much of what I find online seems dated.

Here's a little about me. 21 years young, junior studying mechanical engineering, extremely disciplined (regarding spending money and sticking with goals), tentatively have job waiting for me after graduation with a starting salary around $60 to $65k (spent last summer with the company and I'll be returning this summer). Also, I receive no financial support from anyone except myself and the government via grants and (unsubsidized) loans. 

Currently I owe 14k in loans (all with interest rates below 4%). I have an emergency fund of $2000 which I saved from last summer - in the event of an emergency I'm sure my family would help me out, but I don't want to be dependent on them. Anyway, this summer I expect to bring in ~$10000 after taxes (haven't done the math for total living expenses for the summer). Through scholarships that I have received and my internship, I am hoping to avoid taking out additional loans and graduate with at MOST 14k in loans. 

I am seeking advice as much relevant advice as possible. Here are some questions I have currently:

* should I focus of expeditiously paying my loans back (reminder: low interest rates) or start investing in stocks, mutual funds, etc, or ""enjoy"" freedom of being young and travel/go to concerts/all around enjoy my youth (sister and friends say I should enjoy myself more but honestly the only things I splurge on are healthy foods and gym clothes haha)

* buy new (not literally new, but more reliable) car - not sure if I want to purchase outright or make payments/installments (to build credit score more)

* uhm yeah that's all I can think of

If there are questions you think I should be asking, please do me a huge favor and answer them anyway. I know just enough about personal finance to know that I don't know nearly enough!

personalfinance,Pay off car @2% Interest ?,"I am 24M living in Bay Area, CA. I max my 401K (17.5k), IRA (5.5k), HSA (3.5k), have 10k emergency fund (Ally 1% Savings Account), and put around 10k a year in taxable investment accounts.

I have $9k left on my car. Does it make sense to pay it off?
I was under the understanding that since the interest on the car loan is only 2% it might make sense only pay the minimum.

I know some people think that you should always eliminate debt ASAP. Others say that you should only pay off debt with interest rate &gt;4% (otherwise make the minimum payment).  I was part of the latter group but now I'm not sure anymore. 

I was going to use the emergency fund to pay it off and then slowly build it back up again. Being 100% debt free just feels good to me, but does it make sense in my situation?

I'd like advice as to what I should do in this situation. Thank you!",finance,1427670507
personalfinance,Drowning in debt and can't afford to work,"My family is struggling to make ends meet. My husband works full time, I'm a full time student, we have 2 kids and another on the way. My son was a surprise, born in December. I had a lot of complications and restrictions with my pregnancy which made it nearly impossible to do anything for the last few months of my pregnancy, so my husband had to miss a lot of work to take care of me and our older daughter. This caused us to get behind on just about all of our bills, including mortgage and both car payments. On top of that, the medical bills just piled up from me being in the hospital nearly every other week. We were thankfully able to use our tax refund to catch up on almost everything, and things started to look better. Then my husband got sick and had to miss more work, and now we are behind on our mortgage (among other things) again. 

Also, barely 4 months after my son's birth, I found out that I am pregnant again (despite being on birth control pills and my husband getting a vasectomy), and trying to fund day care for 3 kids just will not work for us - we would probably even lose money if I went back to work. I should also say that my husband does make good money, above average for the area, so we don't qualify for any kind of assistance. We're just so far in debt that his paychecks don't cover it.

Even before all this craziness happened, I had racked up a good $10,000+ in credit card debt (some frivolous purchases but mostly groceries and things for my family). All of that debt is now in a consolidation agreement, which has helped lower interest rates and monthly bills, but we're still barely making it. 

I feel like I can't see any good way to go about helping ourselves. Our mortgage is lower than the average rent in the area, so the only way I could see getting a lower payment is to buy a cheaper house, which we really can't because our credit is completely screwed. We are upside-down on both vehicles and will need to trade one in for something bigger to haul the kids in, however I'm scared to see what interest rates we could possibly get with our credit. Then, today it occurred to me how much student loan debt I will have come next year. I know that I will be able to get a better-paying job once I've earned my degree, but being pregnant and having a newborn has put quite a hinderance on my academic abilities and I'm worried I will have to take a year off school, especially if this pregnancy is anything like my last. 

Basically, what I want to do is decrease our monthly bills. I want to be able to move to a more affordable house, maybe trade our vehicles for older models to decrease our monthly payments on those...but with our credit, I'm not sure if that's even possible. 

I coupon, bargain shop, and pick up occasional freelance work when it's available, but it's just not enough. I've started thinking that maybe there is no way out except bankruptcy. I don't feel like we will ever be able to catch up on our monthly bills, medical bills, student loan debt, and credit card debt. 

**TL;DR: we have tons of debt with more and more piling up, I can't afford to work and put my kids in day care, and I just don't see a good way out**

Any information or advice would be appreciated! I will be looking into professional financial advice a well.

**EDIT: thank you so much to those of you who gave actual, useful advice! (for future reference, ""get rid of/don't have kids"" is not useful advice unless you're heartless) I now have a good idea of where to start and will be meeting with a professional financial counselor who specializes in rebuilding credit and budgeting. I'll be cutting the phone bill down and getting rid of cable to start, and then focus on getting rid of one or two vehicle payments. I also found a much better rate for auto insurance, so that will help as well. Again, thank you for your input!**",finance,1427671081

financialindependence,FI/RE Check for a 42yo military retiree currently working,"Hello FI. I'm posting with a new account because my other account is too dox-able and I don't like having all these numbers out there. Call me paranoid ... I hope that is OK.

Some Background for context: 42M, single (but attached), no kids, and I retired from the military late 2014 and am now working as a standard issue consultant. I had planned to follow the standard issue path of a year or two as a contractor followed by a GS position and a second retirement. But lately I'm rethinking that. I'm renting my current housing, living in a VERY high cost area and almost surely going to move to a lower cost no-income-tax state ... or at least a cheaper part of ""this area""!!!

&amp;nbsp;

So without further ado here are some facts about me:  


&amp;nbsp;

**RETIREMENT ASSETS**

Description | Current Value | 2015 contrib left | 2016 -2020 contrib| Notes 
---|---|---|---|---
Cash Savings | $16k| $7.5k | $10k | 
Vanguard Taxable | $41k | $8k | $8k | Bonus + 25/26th paychecks
Vanguard Roth IRA | $59k | $5.5k | $5.5k | Backdoor ROTH 
Vanguard Roth 401k | $8k | $13.25k | $21.75k | With match
Federal TSP pre-tax | $183k |
Total | $307k | $34.25k | $45.25k |90%/5%/5% Stocks/Bonds/Reserves
So if the market gains 0% in the next five years I'm still looking at ~$511k in savings
  
&amp;nbsp;

**OTHER ASSETS / LIABILITIES**

Description | Value | Notes 
---|---|---
Rental Condo | +$1 |-$75k loan / $80k equity; rent is just shy of costs after taxes |
2001 Car  | +$5k | Paid off
2010 Car  | +$15k |Paid off Dec 2015
That's it | No other outstanding debts | Credit card is paid off every month

&amp;nbsp;

**INCOME**  

Description | Value | Notes
---|---|---
Pension | $43 k/y today| Taxable, NO FICA/SS, CPI Adj
Disability | $16 k/y today | Non-taxable, CPI Adj
Total | $59k | After Fed/State tax: $51k

&amp;nbsp;

**EXPENSES**:  
Housing here is killer. If I didn't have to commute, I could stay in the area but move a little further out and still enjoy all the area has to offer and the friends I've made.  But I also hate the weather so I'm tempted to pickup and move to a warmer cheaper area with no state income tax. I'm planning to live primarily on my pension alone for a while especially the first 5 years while I build a ROTH ladder.  I am also assuming / planning / dreaming that I'd officiate some sports and walk dogs to keep me busy and make some petty cash but that isn't figured into my FIRE determination.

*Healthcare:* I have Tricare Prime now and access Tricare Life later on. It is inexpensive (for now) and figured into my expenses.

I've been using YNAB for about 6 months and believe I have a pretty good handle on my current expenses. I also think I have a good idea how they will change when I retire. Here are a few scenarios:

Expense Level | Amount | Notes
---|---|---
Current | $78k /y | Savings and work expenses stopped; car paid off
Drop the Dead Weight | $69k /y | Rental Property Sold
Find a cheaper place to live | $53k /y | Housing costs cut in half; local move or new state
Start cutting life style | $47k /y| 25% Reduced ""fun"" categories and luxuries


I've run a whole slew of cFIRE simulations but I don't need it to tell me if I get my expenses below my pension I don't even need savings. That said, it also tells me is that with my current retirement accounts right now I can spend ~$70k/y, ignoring the $19.5k SS will give me at 62yo, with no failure scenarios.  

So as I type this it seems like even more of a no brainer. But please tell me FI, what am I missing???",finance,1427677113

personalfinance,(EU) Grad Student in the US. No debt and accumulating savings. Is there more to do with my money?,"Alright I'm going to try to be giving as much details as possible. It might be long...


**TL-DR: 26M Non-US Citizen, Grad Student with no loans, 30k$ salary. 15+k$ and 14k€ in savings. No 401k/IRA. What to do?**


I've been lurking PF for a while now, and as much as it gave me plenty of insight about personal finances, especially in a US-centric context, I wish to post my situation and ask for advice. 

I am in my 2nd year of Grad School. I am going for PhD, so I have at least 2/3 more years before graduation. My post-graduation plan is to find a job here, so I see my future in the US for now. I do not exclude to go back to Europe eventually later down the road. Typical salary out of my PhD program are in the 100/115k$ range, maybe more.


Now my personal finances:

* **Rent**: I have a pretty unique situation. i live in a ""Living Group"" form my University. Kind of like a frat but without the frat aspect of the community. It's basically a student run house. It is pretty cheap (rent + all utilities + food for breakfast/dinner = 600$/month). This awesome deal is balanced by other aspects that are beyond this post. I can expand in comments if questions arise :)

* **Transport**: I commute by bus or walking. 50% off thanks to the university. 35$/month. I do not own a car

* **Cellphone** : T-Mobile, 32$/month. Google Play 10$/month (I listen to a lot of music + it integrates well between my computer and my nexus5).

* **Other expenses** are mainly getting food on campus, dinner out, and other common expenses. Because of the first 2 points above I am not really worrying about my day-to-day expenses. I have been living like this for 1.5 year. I value the feeling of not having to worry about my spending. I basically could be even cheaper on my expenses but it would be at the cost of this peace of mind. This would of course change if my housing situation were to change. Overall I would ballpark my monthly expenses of all kind (minus rent) at 500-600$/month.

* **yearly expenses / One time big expenses** : with my money I've been able to buy tickets back home twice a year, and also I just went to Viet-Nam for vacation with my girlfriend. I've also purchased a Nexus 5 (400$) and a nice computer (1500$) over the past year. I am much more careful with those expenses and usually consider all the implications of such spendings. I have nothing big in sight for now. My next big expense is probably going to be my plane tickets for next Christmas/NYE, usually it is &lt;1000$.




Now my income and assets:

* **Graduate Stipend** : All my tuition is paid by my funding, so is my health insurance. I don't really see that money, but that means I don't have to take any loan... which is good. I receive 2450$/months as stipend. 13% of which is withheld for federal taxes + a bit for state. In the end I see 2050$/months on my bank account. I will receive a small raise later this year (+3000$/yr) as I will become officially ""PhD Candidate"".

* **Taxes**: I just posted my tax return and because of the source of my income (8 months of 2014 were on a fellowship) + my citizenship (French) I am able to make most of my income exempted from taxes. I will receive a 4600$ refund this year. I worked 4 months in 2013 and got 1300$ back.

* **USD Savings**: I currently have a little bit more than 11k$ on my checking account + saving. Tax return has yet to arrive + stipend for the month of march. My rent is also paid at once for a semester, so I do not have to spend anything on that side until the end of May. All that money is basically my emergency fund, but it's just sitting there for now.

* **EUR Savings**: In my home country I have saved a bunch before going to Graduate School. I have a little bit more than 14k€ in savings. They are in tax-free saving accounts that are earning between 1 and 1.7%/yr. Not much, but the money is readily available and it can also be used as emergency fund (my French credit card let me retrieve up to 3000$/week in ATM. if I use BoA I don't have any fee other than the USD/EUR rate from the bank).




Now I have been through the [common topics]( http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics ) and I have some questions related to my specific situation and the fact that I don't know much about how the US system works (I've been reading a lot but when it comes to make an educated decision...). 


For instance, in the common topics wikipage; 

* **Step 0**: I could reduce my expenses even more but I am already saving  more than 15k$ in 1.5 year while living normally. I can always go cheaper, but I am willing to pay a bit more for convenience.

* **Step 1a**: Emergence Fund is already there I think. The only real emergency I could see is loosing my housing option. But even then, my salary is pretty secure for the foreseeable future, and I have more than a year worth of typical rent in the area.

* **Step 1b**: Tuition is covered by my program. I don't have pre-existing loans, and I don't anticipate any after PhD!

* **Step 2**: This is where my situation gets a bit more tricky: in graduate school you don't really get 401k matching or anything like that. 

* **Step 3**: I don't have any debts.

* **Step 4**: Opening an IRA? Now I am clueless here: I will be in the US for a few years and I will probably start my career here. But let's say that 5/10/15yrs from now I decide to move back to France (where retirement funding is automatically deduced from your salary) what will happen? Is worthwhile if you're not sure you'll retire in the US?

* **Step 5a**: Since I don't have a 401k, same question as for the IRA. Is it worth it if you're not US citizen and not sure to be in the US 5/10/15yrs down the road?

* **Step 5b**: This might be more fitting to my situation but it is very confusing for me where to start and what to shoot for?

* **Step 6**: Same as 5b.



I think I'll stop here as it's quite long already. **Any advice or question is welcome as I have probably missed some things along the way!** Thank you for reading so far down the post. Also I realize my situation is more akin to a ""1st world problem"" compared to some of the success stories on this subreddit. I really do admire the dedication and the willpower people have demonstrated when trying to come back from situations infinitely more difficult than mine. I hope I did not offend anyone with this post and hope it did not come out as bragging on my side. I did not know any other place to ask my dumb questions about savings/retirement/investment.",finance,1427684117

I don't know how it happened but I accumulated over $18,000 in debt over the years. Some of it was inherited from when I was making my way up the food chain and the rest kind of happened. It doesn't seem to go away. 

$6,000 credit card (7.1%)    
$3,600 credit card (17%)    
$6,800 debt consolidation loan (6.9%)    
$2,300 debt consolidation loan (6.9%)

I have roughly $12,000 in an emergency fund. My monthly bills are $1,600/month (Rent, Utilities, Student Loans) with no car payment. Add extra $500 for minimum payments on CC's and Debt Loans. About $2,100/month total. I'm tempted to just drop my savings on the debt to minimize it but I obviously need some cash on hand. 

I'm assuming I would pay off the highest interest rate first then work my way down. Maybe get another debt consolidation loan to control the larger credit card.

While I may be in a better financial position than most I feel embarrassed because I worked hard and now I can't even enjoy it. I still feel broke. Personal finance has been difficult for me since I was pretty poor growing up and never had a role model to show me how to handle finances responsibly. 

If you have any advice for how to approach this it would be appreciated.",finance,1427697524

It does exactly what I want, but it's very simplistic. I am looking for a calculator that takes into account:

1. current debt and interest rate
2. current savings into tax deferred, tax free, taxable accounts
3. projected investment returns, and inflation
4. current annual expenses
5. desired retirement expenses
6. models US taxation based on income
7. current income, expected raises, expected spending increases, and raise/spending ""caps"" (I'll get ~3-4% bumps up to 200k income and after that my salary wont rise much)
8. what am i forgetting?

[this](http://www.flexibleretirementplanner.com/wp/download/) is a pretty sweet calculator but not what I'm looking for at the moment. very useful for evaluating a portfolio though.

Of course there's [firecalc](http://www.firecalc.com/) and [cfiresim](http://www.cfiresim.com/input.php) but those assume you know when you will retire and are more for analyzing your portfolio robustness.

investing,Passive Income Series – Forex Trading – A New Investment Option,"Diversify your portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. How many times have you heard these statements? While these statements can apply to more to just finances, the chances are that you understand that it is a bad idea to invest all your cash in one stock, or put all your money into the same property - but have you really thought about a long term strategy?
Current bank interest rates can only be described as shocking. I read an article at work today that discussed how an Aberdeen Assets fund manager has stated that the safest place for savers to put their money is in shares. While this might seem like an outrageous statement to most, he makes a good point; investing money in a savings account is a pretty bad idea. Given the current rates of inflation versus the interest rates… you are guaranteed to lose money.

What is Forex Trading?
Forex Trading is something we have all probably heard about at some point – perhaps through an advert in the Financial Times or a money magazine of some sort; but do you actually know what it means? Forex trading is the trading of foreign currency (hence the name foreign exchange). Essentially, you buy one currency with another – the idea being using the fluctuating currency conversion rates to your advantage.
 Screen Shot 2013-03-26 at 22.06.01
Success Story – The Accidental Pay Day
I have a great personal example of how you can make some serious money on the Forex markets. My uncle and his family live in the US after he emigrated over 20 years ago. After leaving the UK, he sold his property and left a large sum of money in a UK bank account. He owns a project management type business and a few years back had to transfer a large sum of money as collateral for an insurance bond – essentially he had to use the nest egg as a guarantee against the insurance policy for a job. He transferred the money from GBP (British Pounds Sterling) to USD (US Dollar) at a rate of approximately $2 for every £1. £80,000 of savings became equivalent to $160,000.
Now he kept this money in the bond to guarantee the insurance for about nine months and transferred the cash back to his UK account shortly after. He thought nothing of this for about a year, until he received his annual interest statement for the UK bank account. Can you imagine the shock (and delight) upon finding out that £80,000 was now over £100,000!? Now I can assure you that the bank didn’t decide to pay him 25% interest, but instead the foreign exchange markets had changed significantly: £1 to $2 had become £1 to $1.50. A case of trading the money at the right time – Had it been the other way around, he would have made a significant loss!
 
Who is Forex Trading For?
The simple answer is everyone! Anyone is able to trade in foreign exchange, but those who have interests and investments in multiple countries had a slight advantage as they can trade between bank accounts. For example, if I have investments in the US (or at least in dollars) and in the UK, I could benefit from having assets in both currencies and move funds when the markets are advantageous to your positions, but there can be significant fees associated with this technique. Others will use Forex trading platforms to convert money between different currencies with the intent purely to make money – i.e. there is no practical reason (like to invest in a property) for converting from one currency to the other.
 
Like anything else, Forex Trading has a level of risk associated with it. There are many resources online where you can learn about the principles of Forex and trading within the market. I highly recommend that you do some reading and research before jumping in – You can lose money as well as gain through trading currencies. That said, if you are totally risk adverse, maybe the low-interest savings accounts are a better option. You have to be prepared to lose some (if not all) of your investment or play. Similar to the stocks and shares, some currencies are more stable than others – politically unstable currencies are far more likely to fluctuate than the US dollar.

I'm new to getting a mortgage and there's a couple things I need to understand. I will be getting a fixed rate mortgage (VA), and would like to start with lower payments so even though its not necessary, I will put a 10% deposit. I expect my income in the future will increase, at which point I would like to pay down the mortgage. Is there much difference between getting a 30 year mortgage and paying it down to where it becomes, lets say, a 15 year mortgage, or getting a 15 year mortgage off the bat. I understand the interest rate will be slightly lower for 15, but i will get easier early payments in return so I am willing to make that compromise. Are there any other factors I should be considering?

Husband and I currently have 2 ""in debt"" credit cards &amp; just got approved for 2 ""new"" credit cards which we think we should be transferring some of this older debt onto.

After going through a crazy month of crazy medical crisis last month (with no health insurance mind you), I'm trying to get ahead our finances a bit straighter. Both of us have found some part time work, but it's hard to fit it in with us both working full time jobs that leave us exhausted during the week. We're trying to make it work to get all this debt paid down hopefully over the course of the next 6mo. to a year.


Current Credit Cards
Capital One- Maxed out at $2 grand, interest rate is around 22% ( I see about 40$ in charges since we've carried this high of a balance). Moving forward I am trying to pay at least $200 or more on this card, but finances are sticky as shit right now.

Quicksilver Card-Maxed out at $500, no interest on this until the end of the year, and this is a ""rewards"" card were we get a small amount back, so far we have only earned $14 or so.


husband was recently approved for a citi bank no interest card, the mailer stuff mentioned specifically transferring balances.

I was approved for a wells fargo visa card, same deal, mentioned transferring balances so we applied.


Both of these cards were approved with $1000 limit each.

How do we move forward from here ""correctly"".

Should we transfer 1K onto each card from the capital one card, and close that one?  &amp; how ""smooth"" is the process typically to do so?",finance,1427729829

personalfinance,"Where can I refinance an auto loan that has only $5,700 left on it?","I have an auto loan that has $5,700 left on it, and is scheduled to be paid off in about 2.5 years. I am not sure what my interest is, but it is pretty high, around 18-21%. 

I had poor credit due to student loan problems hence the high interest, so this loan was taken by a local dealership's in house financing. I am halfway through my loan now, and since I made all my payments on time they sold my loan to a more official lending service, however all the terms stayed the same. 

I am assuming after making these payments on time for awhile I must be able to qualify for some type of better deal than this. I am not looking to make the loan longer. My end game is to keep my monthly payments the same, but just get a lower interest rate.

I am not sure if I would save a lot of money, but I am trying to be more proactive in saving money and bettering my financial responsibility and I felt refinancing my car loan would be good for my money saving momentum and it would be a good learning experience. and save me at lease some money.

The issues I am running into with this is everywhere I check, no one wants to refinance a loan that is less than $7,500. I checked lending tree and capital one with those results. And I started searching google and couldn't find anyone. But I am sure there is some small reputable bank that is willing to make a deal with me. I just don't know where to look.

personalfinance,Trying to figure out the pros and cons of buying a house - help please?,"Hey folks!  So, here's the long and short of it: I'm a guy with tons of student debt and a very good income who is trying to take advantage of his 15 minutes of high income to make the rest of his life more comfortable.

In detail: I'm in my late 20s in the DC area working for a law firm - I have oodles of student loan debt (about 180k - I'm refinancing a portion to take advantage of lower interest rates, but leaving the majority of it federal to take advantage of federal safety net programs) but also a pretty solid income (I'm making 160 this year, will make 170 next year, and will make 185 the following year - lockstep salary progression).

I have no deductions because student loan interest has been completely phased out at my income level.  I have about 12K in a savings account for emergencies (I'm building it up to 20K - my theoretical rainy day fund for up to 6 months of unemployment).  It's pretty hard to stick around doing what I'm doing (attrition rate due to burnout and layoffs is insane), so I'm trying to make the most out of this period of ridiculously good income.  One of the things I've been thinking about is buying a house - I figure I save on rent, and I get to get some mortgage deductions.  I am also considering getting a two bedroom and renting out the spare bedroom.  I don't love living with people, but this is probably the only way I'd have time to manage a rental situation.

I guess what I'm looking for is someone who has experience with mortgage interest deductions, the pros and cons of buying a home, what the one-off costs are, and just general thoughts on whether or not home ownership makes sense for someone like me.

I started a new account because we don't want to tip off his current employers before everything is finalized.

We are moving from the midwest to greater NYC.  He will be making just over $60k a year in Manhattan and has discussed July as a start date.  

I have not begun applying for jobs, but a conservative guess is $35k a year based on craigslist ads for my field.  This will be a $20k increase over our current combined income.

We bought our home in 2012 for $120,000 with an $8k downpayment.  Interest rate at the time was 3% and taxes in our area are low, so our mortgage is only $825 a month.

The plan is to sell this house and use the profits to buy a duplex in the nicest, closest suburb to NYC that we can afford.  We hope to find tennants and keep our total out of pocket mortgage close to what we pay currently.  

To be clear, there is no downpayment saved for this new property.  We are depending entirely on money from the sale of this house for any downpayment on the next property.

We live in our first house and have never sold a property or been landlords, so here are our questions:

* How can we get as much as possible out of the sale of our current house?

* How do we immediately turn around the funds from the sale of our house to buy a new house?

* What is a reasonable timeline for our moving?

* In addtional to the property and upkeep, what are the costs of being a landlord?

* What are we forgetting to worry about?

2) Should I plan to use the money to pay of loans upon graduation, or wait until its value is higher? Federal Grad PLUS loans are locked at 7.21% interest, so if the 401k/IRA is still growing at 8.5%, it would be better to let it grow?

For a bit of background, my husband (34) and I (28) are trying to sort out our finances and finally stick to a budget.  We both have decent-paying jobs (me 90k, him 75k), live in a major metro area (Boston), and have a lot of student debt (around 200k together; I went to law school, he has 2 graduate degrees).  We have no credit card debt, we own a condo with a mortgage of 1200 in the city, have house bills totaling around 500 a month + 2 car payments (see below), &amp; both max out 401k contributions... our only other expenses are going out to eat/entertainment, which we're trying to pull back on a bit as well.

After  both working jobs in the suburbs for the last 4 years, I have a new job that allows me to rely on public transportation (husband still drives 100 miles a day, round trip to work).  At this point, we are thinking of selling one of our two cars; I'm hoping we can save a decent chunk of change every month in car payments/insurance/gas, and I'm wondering if this is the right move long-term.

My husband owes about 12k on his car, which is a 2012 Honda Accord EX-L.  The car currently has about 60K miles on it.  I recently purchased a car (almost a year ago now), a Subaru Impreza Sport limited 2.0 (2015), and I owe 22.5K (only has about 7K miles total on it).  Interest rates are 0% and 1.9%, respectively.  We live in Boston, so while both cars are decent in snow, the Subaru is obviously better.

I'm definitely leaning toward getting rid of one of the cars, but I question which one is the best one to let go.  I worry (perhaps irrationally) about needing a car again in a year or two if I happen to switch jobs (I have no plans to), so that's holding me back a bit.  We don't want to stay in our current condo forever, and we want to have children in a few years - though both of these things are flexible in terms of timing.  

Should I go with my gut and attempt to sell one of our cars, as it would save us significantly in the present time?  Which one makes the most sense to hang onto?

How does the 1098 form work? Do I have to keep track of expenses? Do I have to start filing taxes?




If scholarships and loans are considered income, it will effect my health insurance. This is why I am concerned - because my health insurance is income based.

We like passive index investing and have 25% of our savings in a Vanguard ETF, with the rest in a savings account earning negligible interest.

personalfinance,What would you do?,"I purchased a town home in 2012 (built in 2012) for $256,900. Comps are now selling around $300,000. My neighbors are listing for $309,990 and $314,900. (Granted, they have end units, so I assume I'd probably be priced at about $300,000). 

Two years ago, our units were selling in the $280's. The area has shown an increase in value, so I believe my neighbors will get at or near their asking price.


There are town homes being built a block from us (about ~100 units) that according to a town hall meeting, are slated to have a price point beginning in the 300's. We don't know where in the 300's. We do know the various square footage, and the base model will be smaller than my home. 


Construction on the new town homes is slated to begin in the fall of this year.

I'm thinking about packing up my family (husband and soon to be two children) and moving in my mom's tiny bungalow in the far suburbs. I'm doing this to try to pay off my student loans and have the ability to handle my husbands (which will come due January of 2017).

Here's a wrinkle- we're due with a baby in early September. 

Would you: a) Move now and try to get $300K? b) Move in a year from now after the baby is born and you're settled, and cross your fingers that you can get even more? c) Stick it out and continue to live in our home.

Note about a) Now would be the safest. Interest rates haven't risen yet and our immediate market wouldn't be flooded by potential buyers for the new construction. 

Note about b) It's a long story about why a year from now would be easiest. I'll explain more if requested. I know we'd take a risk in our value not increasing.

Note about c) We lived at my mom's after I graduated and our plan to stay a year was derailed when she kicked us out. We lived there for 6 months and saved as much as we could for this house. She has some mental instability, which generally makes everyone miserable. However, she is a good grandparent, and we would get built-in free child care. If we stay, it'll be tight, but I think we can do it. We'll defer some of his loans and cross our fingers the patchwork of babysitters we have continues to pan out.",finance,1427740030

I have a bunch of monthly bills but my current salary covers all of them with no problem. I'm about to get a small raise, which after all the math and deductions will come out to about an extra $120 a month. I already have a 401k going and I'm not too worried about adding more than I already am to that. I have a great credit score. So here's my current predicament:

I still have $34k in student loans. Making monthly payments of $182 that spread out across them all, but I've barely put a dent in them. Interest rates vary from 3.4-6.8%

About $11k left on car note. Making monthly payments. Will be paid off by 2019. 

I only have about $1,100 in my savings/emergency fund. I try to put money away each month but I struggle with this. I also don't touch this money once it's there. 

Should I put the extra $120 I make all directly towards my student loans, paying more than the monthly bill? Or should I put it all in savings? Or split it up? The student loans are what stress me out. I want to be out of that debt, but I also want to build up my savings account. Just confused on what the better choice is for the long run.

Bitcoin,Today's revelations about corruption and money laundering on the part of investigators of the Silk Road has given us a beautiful gift.,"If you are up to speed with the revelations today regarding Federal Agents attempting to launder bitcoins that they illegally obtained, then please also consider this wonderful gift they have given us.
  
**Current regulations are enough.**  We do not need more regulation, if anything, any effort put towards regulation should go towards enforcing and facilitating the enforcement of current regulations regarding AML\KYC.  And evaluating where current regulations fall short or overreach. 
  
It was because of current regulations that the federal agent working for the IRS was able to bring forth this case and completely trace stolen bitcoins to their exit points in fiat.  It was because of current regulations that the federal agents were so exposed and had to put so much effort into covering their tracks, which only led to more red flags.
   
I hope this is used as an example for states like New York to show that no new regulation is needed and that any additional regulation will not result in less money laundering but will serve to stifle innovation and drive it overseas.

This is fine for me as I'm doing alright aside from some rather large debt this is going to really help me with.

My question is - I just got the payout, which will be for tax year 2015 as far as I know.

The paperwork I have indicates the total eligible payout was $23,356.67.

The lump sum payout is less 20% mandatory federal income tax withholding.

The sum I received is therefore $18,845.75.

My question is: should I set aside more for potential taxes I may owe on it for tax year 2015? If so, how much? I was thinking to set aside a further 20% of the original amount ""just in case,"" but thought I'd ask other people.

I can also increase my withholding with my current and future employers for the year, would that make more sense, just send the money I have now to my interest-bearing cards and have my paychecks slowly send extra to the government?",finance,1427743901

electronics,"Making a simple audio trigger from transistors, diodes, and a condenser capsule?","I'm (vaguely) familiar with the operating principle of a condenser microphone element - a change in capacitance prompts a tiny onboard FET to make a tiny change in voltage. This is then fed to highly sensitive analog electronics so you get a useful audio output. 

I happen to have a rather more crude application - a device that registers an ouput when the microphone is tapped against a hard surface. I was hoping to do this with the following:

1. Send the output of the capsule to a transistor of known gain. 
2. Use a voltage divider pot to set a fraction of the output. 
3. Use a zener diode to set a cut-off minimum voltage to trigger
4. Connect the output of the zener diode to another transistor to trigger the output. 

Using a capacitor to filter the output of the zener diode might also help. Am I on the right track, or barking up the wrong tree?",technology,1427747551
personalfinance,"Considering taking out a student loan for summer school. I am able to pay for it out of pocket, however.","Hi /r/personalfinance. I have a dilemma. The financial aid from my school this year has run out and I have received the maximum allotted amount of $400 for my summer school; however, I am taking 11 credits at $400/credit hour. Because of my financial aid, I have never taken out a loan for school, so I have no credit as a result. 

The financial aid advisor at my school told me because I have not taken my FED Direct Subsidized Loans for the 2014-2015 school year, they can be used for the summer. These loans can apparently pay for the full summer. My family cannot take out the parent loan (really bad credit) but they still offered to help, but I am not comfortable taking my mom's money (she makes very little, hence financial aid) or my grandparents' money (retirement: I want them to be comfortable/they already help me too much).

Here's the dilemma: I have the money for the summer in a savings account. I have accrued ~$10,000 from working for 6 years and from refunds due to financial aid (I could cover rent with my work money, so the refunds were deposited or only partly used). I would like to save this money for my eventual travels to conferences and to graduate schools as I am coming up on my senior year of university. I have received full financial aid again for the 2016 year so if I am frugal once more, my savings account should grow by a few thousand by May of 2016 (when I graduate).

So my question is should I take this loan to build my credit and save my accrued money, or should I pay for my schooling through my own funds and keep myself out of debt? I'm leaning toward the loan in case I need my money later.

I'm pretty lost and need a good push either way.",finance,1427748276

personalfinance,Need some input on paying off a few loans.,"So I just got married. The only debt I have is our house. However, my wife has a couple loans. It's a somewhat unique situation, so I just wanted input, as I do already have a plan set up. Here's the breakdown. 

Home Loan - $91,287 - Interest 4.375 - Minimum monthly payment $853. I'm paying $1,153 right now, and was planning to up that by another $100 a month this year.

Wife's Federal Student Loan - $35,134 - Interest 6.25 - Minimum payment (what she's paying now) 201. Now, this loan actually gets forgiven after 10 years of consecutive payments because my wife works in social work. She's made 27 consecutive payments so far, which leaves us 7.75 years on that. 

Wife's private loan - $12,834 - interest 4.56 - Minimum payment (what she's paying) 110. 

I'm maxing my 401k and IRAs. I know she's putting in a decent amount for her retirement, just not sure what. But I'm honestly not worried about that. I already have my stuff in place to be able to support the both of us when we would retire, w/o counting on anything from her or the government. 

I know general logic would say pay off her 6.25 loan first, but it gets forgiven in 7 years, so we should just keep to the minimum on that correct? Next, logic would say we should go with the 4.56 one, but I'd like to keep putting any extra cash we have towards our house. Right now I'd have it paid off in 7 years, likely less if I keep bumping my payments every year with raises. The reason I want to do that is because we will want a bigger house then, and I'm going to turn this one into a rental, so that will be additional income at that point, which I'd probably throw at the other loan, provided she couldn't spare more cash to pay it off sooner. 

Honestly, I could have not gave a crap about her loans and she'd of continued on paying the minimums until they went away. But I feel like that's just stupid. We've considered money ours (not mine and hers) for a long time as is. 

Thoughts? 

**tldr** have 3 loans, the 35k gets forgiven in 7 years, my house loan is less than the other one, but I want to pay it off sooner to turn it into a rental. Good idea?

I've been employed for about a year now and have settled into a position to really start paying off my loans. My AGI is roughly 32k. I live/work in the DC area to give you a sense of my expenses. My best estimate is that I have 1400-1600/mo to pay on all of my loans.

I've lurked this sub as well as /r/studentloans and have gotten some good info such as different payment options, finding all the loans I have. I just want to know what how to organize necessary info for when I talk to Navient/ECMC to start payments. My biggest concern is not having any loans fall through the cracks as I have 9 different ones. I want to bundle them into 1 or 2 payments so there isn't much juggling. Also I am confused as my ECMC account has 3 loans that they are overseeing (?) even though they aren't delinquent.

I know that what I can afford barely makes a dent but it will be better than nothing and at least I will be able to better breathe knowing I'm working toward some kind of resolution.

personalfinance,Should I pay off some of my student loans now or save my money for next years tuition?,"Pardon my incompetence.  I have student loans from my first two years of engineering school.  I went to college out of state and racked up 49k of debt.

34k of it is private with Wells Fargo, 15k is federal. The private loan is at 9% interest.  I make monthly payments between $20-$50 to keep the interest down.  I'm not sure if that's super smart or not, but anyway.

I transferred to a cheaper, in-state school when I realized how quickly I was accruing debt.  I got a decent job and payed off my 3rd year of college in full (no extra loans) and I still have one year to go.

In the past few months I did a lot of freelance jobs during school and now I have around $7,500 in savings.  I live at home and commute to school so my monthly expenses are not high (~$250-$300 a month for car, food, etc.)

Here's my question:  Should I apply some of that $7,500 savings to my private loans, or should I save it all for next years tuition?  I am still working and still adding to the savings but I don't want money to sit there if it would be smarter to apply it to my current loans.  If I pay down some of the private loan I already have, I'll have to take out more loans for next year, but I'm thinking I'll be able to get federal loans instead of private.

I know I've made a lot of dumb mistakes but any advice for my situation is really appreciated.

personalfinance,Student Credit Card?(UK),"Hi finance people of Reddit! (If this is best posted somewhere else please refer me).

Considering accepting this contract for a student credit card (I know it sounds like an awful idea off the bat!). Can someone (ELI5) summarise/explain a bit about the APR/monthly rate/annual rate? Does it just refer to the monthly and annual interest in percentages? If so- is this a ""good"" card?

My situation (and what I consider ""good""):
University student in final year. My main use for this card would be to get by those tricky times where I have to wait for my bursary/student loan to drop, where sometimes I am down to my last pennies! So relatively low expenses now and then as necessary.
I am a student so obviously low interest etc. is ideal (i.e. not placing myself in a situation where I am worsening my finances). 
I am responsible with money/budgets, no chance of me using it on a random, impulse shopping trip etc.

It is a credit card with a limit of £500 BTW.

Here are the few points of the contract I don't understand 100%:

- ""The total amount you will have to pay.
This means the amount you have borrowed plus interest and other costs:
£547.32. This is what you will repay over one year based on the assumption that you start with a zero balance and all of the credit limit (less any annual fee amount) is used to make a purchase. The annual fee (if there is one) is treated as debited to the account on the same day as the purchase is debited. The purchase balance and any annual fee balance are reduced to zero by 12 equal instalments which together with interest are paid monthly. It is assumed that no other transactions take place and the purchase interest rate remains unchanged.""

- ""Costs of the credit.
The rates of interest which apply to the credit agreement:
	
Transaction Type:	

- Purchases- Monthly Rate: 1.456%  Annual Rate: 17.472% p.a.

- Balance Transfers- Monthly Rate: 1.456%  Annual Rate: 17.472% p.a.

- Money Transfers-  Monthly Rate: 1.456% Annual Rate: 17.472% p.a.

- Advances	-  Monthly Rate:2.075%  Annual Rate: 24.9% p.a.""

[[[What are advances??]]

- ""Annual Percentage Rate of Charge (APR).
This is the total cost expressed as an annual percentage of the total amount of credit.
The APR is there to help you compare different offers:	
18.9% APR (variable). This is calculated using the same assumptions applied to calculate the total amount you will have to pay (as also set out in Section 2). You start with a zero balance and all of the credit limit (less any annual fee amount) is used to make a purchase. The annual fee (if there is one) is treated as debited to the account on the same day as the purchase is debited. The purchase balance and any annual fee balance are reduced to zero by 12 equal instalments which together with interest are paid monthly. It is assumed that no other transactions take place and the purchase interest rate remains unchanged.""

personalfinance,"New student loans, two apartments applications, and a credit card -- should I worry about my credit score?","Next month I'll be moving back to the US after almost five years abroad. Honestly, I'm realizing now that I know embarrassingly little about how credit scores work and need a little guidance for the smartest way to proceed. 

In short, this year I'm going back to school full time starting in May and will need to take out between $30-40k in federal student loan debt. I'm also in the process of subletting an apartment for the summer, and I'll then be applying for a full-time apartment once the school year starts in August. On top of that, I'd like to get a credit card that will give me some sort of cash back or reward benefits as well. 

I have pulled my credit report recently and everything seems squeaky clean with on time payments and good credit history (this is largely thanks to my mom who added me to some of her cards so I could build credit as a college student). Estimates say my credit score should be somewhere around the 710-760 range (I hope they're right; if that sounds too generous, I honestly have no idea). 

I read that ""hard pulls"" of my credit score will have a negative effect, but the sublet credit check and need for a credit card are pretty inevitable, as are the student loans. I'm worried that with so many things happening in such a short time, my score could take a big hit and I wouldn't qualify to rent my full time apartment once the school year starts. My parents are relatively poor despite being responsible with their money, and they flat out told me they probably don't make enough to cosign on any of this stuff if it comes to that. 

Could new student loans + two apartment credit checks + a new credit card be enough to bomb my score so much that I wouldn't be able to rent an apartment? I realize that the answer depends on whatever score you're starting with and how strict the complex is, but I want to be as proactive as I can about this in the meantime.",finance,1427770574

He went to a private medical school and had to sign a waiver not to work. We were in a different country so I was legally not allowed to work. We have a son and I stayed at home with him and worked a job from home that I didn't have to get a visa for. The income I got from that job was used to help with expenses, and the rest of our living expenses came from loans. 

Because it was a private school, tuition was painfully high. When all is said and done, we will be near 450k when he is done with med school. Our plan is for him to find a place with a loan pay bonus, but those are normally capped at around 90k paid over a couple of years. Along with that, we will do the IBR payment plan and after 10 years, the rest should be forgiven. So, we will be paying the bare minimum loans for 10 years based on his income. If it wasn't going to be forgiven after 10 years, we would throw everything we had at it to get rid of it as quickly as possible. 

I am working 3 jobs from home trying to help make ends meet. We are back in the US so legally I am allowed to work, but we can't afford daycare for our 2 sons so I stay with them and do what I can to help. With the 3 jobs, I make about 700-1000 dollars a month. Right now we are using that money to pay our car loan down (12,000). Once that is gone, I'm not sure what to do with that money or the money my husband will get during residency. 

Should we be contributing that money and my husbands future paycheck to an IRA if we have so so so so much money owed in loans? Should we completely forget college funds and retirement when we have so much money to pay in loans? What if the loan forgiveness plan is done away with after 9 years of us paying expecting it to be erased? I am just not sure what direction to go in here. We have always lived like we are impoverished so we plan on keeping the same lifestyle and figuring out where to put the money we have left over.

&gt;This post should be read by many economists who misunderstand the difference between nominal and real interest rates and who think that central banks can control any single monetary variable. I would like to highlight some valid points and make some comments/criticisms:

&gt;- Central banks can only try to fix short-term nominal interest rates; they are not generally able to fix neither long-term interest rates nor the real return on capital. This is true. However, this does not mean that central banks do not influence both. 1º Long-term interest rates should just depend on the long-term supply and demand of capital, but the banking system can modify that equilibrium with maturity mismatching: the practise of borrowing short and lending long sets long-term rates at “artificially low levels” (savers' and investors' time frames are not coordinated from a macroeconomic point of view). Central banks help the banking system to amplify maturity mismatching by providing them with a liquidity safety net. 2º Real return on capital is not an independent variable of malinvestments and overindebtedness: therefore, if maturity mismatching can explain (as I think it can) most of cyclical malinvestment and overindebtedness, then central banks do influence real return on capital.

&gt;- Central banks are not responsible of current ultra-low return on capital (ultra-low interest rates), economic crisis and deleveraging are. Another valid point. Ultra-low rates are not mainly an issue of excessive supply of credit but of lack of new demand for credit. However, it is difficult to think that central banks’ quantitative easings do not have any responsibility in negative interest rates. If you multiply cash availability when no good investment opportunities exist, one will have to store that extra-cash somewhere. Money storage is expensive and Treasury liabilities may be a good deal even at negative interest rates.

&gt;- It is true that central banks must fix some interest rate under a fiat money system. They cannot avoid it as they are the ones in charge of regulating dynamically the monetary base. Therefore it is also true that central bankers need to wonder whether they are fixing a too high or too low rate. However, I have two deep disagreements with the rest of the reasoning. First, central banks interest rates should not depend on the macroeconomic performance of the economy: that is the role of the real return on capital (of real interest rates), not of short-term nominal interest rates. Preferential short-term interest rates (i.e., central bank intervention rates) are a way of advancing money to accrued real earnings (i.e., of providing liquidity where real liquidity pre-exists and is needed, as Bagehot clearly understood): therefore, preferential short-term rates should only depend on lender and borrower liquidity, not on the CPI, the rate of growth and the level of unemployment. The purpose of stimulating the economy by lowering short-term interest rates is tantamount to create a lending boom by stimulating banks to arbitrage short-term and long-term interest rates. This is, I am afraid, a very dangerous path of future malinvestments, bubbles and overindebtedness. Second disagreement: central banks only need to actively fix interest rates under a fiat money system: under a gold standard, interest rates are passively fixed by the evolution of central bank reserves. As I see it, nowadays central bankers do not have any good yardstick for fixing short-term interest rates: they can only try to guess what proper rates should be without actually knowing it and, therefore, without actually knowing whether they are coordinating or discoordinating the real economy (something that was already debated in the Bullionist Controversy). Feedback information comes too late and its meaning is not always clear for central bankers (Are we in an asset bubble? Is the current path of lending sustainable? Has that sector grown too much due to slack credit conditions, etc.). In a sense, they suffer from an inability to apply economic calculation to their business: to be the banker of bankers. And the deep reason for this inability is the one I stated before: central banks should set short-term interest rates according to their liquidity situation, but unfortunately they are the ones in charge of creating the measure of liquidity (monetary base). In other words, what does it mean for a central bank to be “illiquid” under a fiat money system? No answer, no sensible monetary policy.",finance,1427815886

I am switching jobs in the middle of the calendar year. Both companies have 401k match policies. Can I get the maximum match from both employers this year? Here are the policies to the best of my knowledge.

Employer #1 - the Company matches your contributions by paying your account one dollar for every dollar that you save (up to 6% of your earnings). The funding of the Company match is deposited in cash at each payroll period. 

Employer #2 - Each time you make a contribution to your 401(k), the company will match that contribution dollar for dollar up to 3% of eligible compensation earned in a pay period, up to the 2015 Federal limit of $7,950 (which is 3% of $265,000, the maximum eligible compensation as defined by the IRS). The employer match is calculated and funded each pay period based on your earnings
and contributions that period.

On the other hand, if I go public I can immediately make 70k with potential for much higher salary, but I have to pay for health insurance, student loans, etc. From a financial standpoint, should I take the leap?",finance,1427818578

personalfinance,[taxes] switched from W2 to 1099. question about income tax,"Like the title states, I switched from W2 to 1099, about halfway through the year, although I stayed with the same employer.  
On my W2 I earned about $18k and about $1500 was withheld for federal income tax.  
On my 1099 I earned about $16k and nothing was withheld.  
I am single with no dependents and have the max ($2500) student loan interest deduction.  
When I entered all this into Turbotax it told me I owe about $4k in federal income tax, about 2X what I was expecting. Is this right? Am I getting hit with penalties because I didn't pay quarterly estimates? Any help/advice/wisdom is appreciated.",finance,1427820136
personalfinance,Credit Card Advice,"Hey PF,  
So right now I am in a bit of a waiting game and am debating what my next move should be and when.  

* 23 year old with a limited monthly income (serving with AmeriCorps and I love it, but it puts my approx. $20,000 loans on hold and I will receive an Education Reward when I finish my term)  
* I have one credit card through my bank I opened while at my old job for $500 limit. It has been about six months now, so it may be time to start looking. However, I once asked a request early and was denied (I know, I goofed), and the reason being that my loans on hold will keep me stuck at this limit until I start paying them (but that may not be til November at the earliest when my service ends).  
* I have a new account at a local credit union and they assured me I would receive a credit card then denied it because my account was too young, but I am now curious if I ever apply for one again if the debt to income ratio thing will be a factor.   
* Current FICO estimates are 710 from my bank in February to currently 723-729 from CK and Credit.  

So, in sum, I have had three hard pulls within the last year (but one is from the approval of the first card) so I do not want to make any pulls anytime soon unless I am pretty confident of my odds. I do know though that my first bank will probably not increase my limit anytime soon, the credit union may (I mentioned my concern about the debt-income ratio and they assured me later that it was not an issue for them, just the account age), and there is a solid offer from Discover It which seems tempting, but am unsure of my odds. If you guys have any input on what may be the best option from here I would greatly appreciate it. Ideally, I may wait another two or three months until I make any final decision but at that point the hard pulls are still there so should I wait for a total of a year? Are three pulls too many (my online snooping around says it is still not bad but getting close to the questionable zone).  

I have no immediate urgent expense to get a new card right now other than just young and want to build a good credit history over the next couple years.",finance,1427820615

personalfinance,Trying to figure out my passive investment strategy,"Hi!  So I made a post yesterday about the wiseness of buying a house (not necessarily today, but sometime in the future), and I got a pretty disappointing but useful dose of reality, so I thought I would make a followup post to to see if anyone had any advice on what I should be doing with my cash.

So, about my finances: I'm 175K in the student debt hole, making 160K (lockstep progression means I'll make 170K next year and 185K the year after - the job has a very high attrition rate though, so the salary is not guaranteed.  There's a pretty decent bonus possibility too).  I live in DC and my apartment costs 1850, which sucks, but I also walk to work and live alone, so it's actually a pretty decent deal.  I've been making the minimum 2K payment on my loans while I build up a 20K safety net, and after that I was planning to repay my student loans in the avalanche method.  I've refinanced 65K of my loans at 4.4% fixed.  I could refinance more (or get a lower rate if I went variable rate), but I'm a little worried about my job stability due to the aforementioned attrition rate, so I was unwilling to refinance the whole package and forego all of my federal protections.

I haven't put anything into my 401(k) and I think that's a relatively easy way to make some cash, since my topmost marginal tax rate is like 35% or something.  On the other hand, if I could build up some savings, I could consider a downpayment on a house in a few years.  If I stay at this job for 5 or 6 years, due to lockstep salary progression I could conceivably put down more than 50% on a house downpayment.  Maybe buy a house outright if it were cheap enough.  Maybe I should forego the 401(k) in favor of saving for home ownership?

I dunno, what would you do in my situation?",finance,1427821286

personalfinance,[Credit] Would it hurt my credit to close my 6 month old AMEX Platinum Card?,"About 6 months ago I got an AMEX Platinum card, knowing the $450 annual fee would be waived due to the fact that I’m in the Military. It was a tough choice, as I have a Discover card with similar benefits &amp; no annual fees, however knowing the fee would be waived, and the 30,000 bonus points being offered for spending $3k in the first 3 months, I decided to make the switch and get the AMEX Platinum.

&amp;nbsp;

I used the card to pay for a Vacation that I'd already saved for, and for Holiday gifts this past winter, and received the bonus points as planned. The rewards program was comparable to my Discover card, and due to the fact that the Platinum must be paid off in full each month made using somewhat nicer because it forces me to use it sparingly, or on things that I already had saved for so I could pay it off instantly. 

&amp;nbsp;

That being said, I've attempted 3 times to have the annual fee waived. The first time I called, spoke to a helpful rep who started the process for me. I checked back a few months later (as she said it could take up to 60 days) and I find out the waiver request was closed without them contacting me (the second rep I spoke to said they should have). I tried a second time, and this time was contacted requesting proof of military service, it was provided, and yet again the claim was closed with no waiver, no reason left as to why. I tried again third time and the claim was closed within days, again the fee's had not been waived. I’ve spoken to a rep a 4th time, this time via online chat, and he said they’d re-open my case... I’m not hopeful.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm getting fed up with AMEX and their poor customer service. I do not feel entitled to the benefit for being a military member, I know plenty of others who are well more deserving, however that perk was the single reason I signed up for the card, and they're beating around the bush, and basically preventing me from receiving a key benefit.  

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR: Would closing my 6ish month old Platinum card harm my credit score? I also have a AMEX Blue that I've had since 2010, I will be keeping that open. The account would be paid in full, all the points used, and I’m told the annual fee would be prorated for the 6 months I had it opened.",finance,1427822740
personalfinance,Taxes &amp; IRA Rollover,"I could have sworn up and down that I set up my old job's IRA as a ROTH IRA. So when I rolled it into another ROTH account last year, I thought I was golden. But I got a 1099R in the mail a couple months ago, telling me that 100% of the balance I transferred last year was taxable, and I was told over the phone by my previous retirement account company that their records indicated that I had transferred from a traditional to a ROTH, so the balance would be taxable. (Here's the fun part - the rollover is marked as ""code G"" on the 1099R. Which I'm told conflicts with the ""taxable balance"" box - in that there should be ""$0"" in there if it's ""code G."") I'm not really in a place right now to pay taxes on my entire retirement account balance - I will bite the bullet if that needs to happen, but I don't think they are showing the correct information on their end, and I think I might have some paperwork that I could put together to fax to them to see if I can get that corrected on their end. I left a voicemail with my previous employer to verify what kind of account I set up, but of course they haven't called me back. (Classy.)

I went in to a free federal tax preparation center yesterday to speak to someone about this, and the lady that I spoke to said that the *real* proof would be to send the previous retirement account company a pay stub, to show them that the retirement money was taxed on the way in, and therefore I had a ROTH IRA set up. But I'm having trouble finding where I can prove that on my pay stub (the following is a slightly abbreviated version, taking out per-hour rate columns and a couple of empty rows):

Is there anything on this pay stub that I'm missing, that clearly points out that I had a ROTH IRA set up with this company? 

The documents I think I can send them are:

* The rollover paperwork, which shows ""ROTH to ROTH transfer"" on it - which they processed without comment (which, if anything, I think I could use as leverage).

personalfinance,"College student - need tips for apartments, loans, and financial independence","Hey guys.  I'm a freshman college student in San Jose and as title says, I need help with apartments.

A little context: for my first year of college, living on campus was mandatory unless you lived very close by (which I did not).  They have enough units for me to stay in a dorm again next semester, but I figure I can save some money by moving to an apartment and splitting rent with a friend (or two).

For my freshman year, I took out a $15000 loan cosigned with my dad (through a credit union) that was distributed to the school at $7500 a semester.  This was in addition to a small (6-10k) college fund provided by my late great grandmother.  This loan does not need any payments until I have finished school.  However, a divorce between my parents means it's unlikely that my dad will be able to cosign again - leaving me unable to obtain another loan.  My mother is receiving a significant settlement, and she wants to pay for an entire year of my college education for me (including rent, tuition, and food).  

My questions are: 

What is the best way to go forward with my education and housing?  Should I look to rent an apartment with a year long lease or try to find something that is month to month? Maybe even rent out a house with more people? 

What kind of loan should I look for, federal/state or private (yes, I filled out my FAFSA)?  

Many of the apartments I have looked at require good credit history - I have close to 0, with a credit card I rarely used (no late payments or anything).  Should I even expect to be accepted if I apply at any of these places?


I'm really confused about where to go from here - if there's any information I've omitted, please ask.  Thanks in advance for any help or replies.

personalfinance,G Fund’s return would drop to nearly zero under House plan,"It is frequently recommended that funds be left in the TSP (government employee version of a 401K) rather than be transferred to a TIRA upon leaving federal service.  The rationale is commonly that the TSP fund components have extraordinarily low expense ratios, and some commenters laud the G fund TSP option as a riskless and valuable investment vehicle for the bond portion of a portfolio.  This makes sense to me, but I now see a risk associated with the TSP in the news, the risk of political manipulation. Since it is strictly under government control, politicians of any stripe can use it as a political tool.
For example, today I see news that brings the political risk into focus.

Then /u/thissmyboomshakalaka posted a [wish list](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/30sb9a/is_this_really_the_best_fi_countdown_calculator/) for a retirement calculator and things just kinda got out of hand.



#RETIREMENT AGE CALCULATOR

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxlbtDe746XAOfuk9bnVgMW_x0HurKguLqNceTqU2b0/edit?usp=sharing


#Overview

Spread FIRE is a spreadsheet I made to demonstrate to my daughter the power of saving early. It quickly grew.

# What Is It?

It’s a calculator to determine the age at which you can comfortably retire. It’s a spreadsheet, which means you can easily customize it for YOU.

It’s NOT a Monte Carlo simulation for expected returns. 

#How to Use

* Sign into a gmail account;
* Make a copy of the sheet;
* Alternatively, download it and open it in your favorite spreadsheet program;
* In general, any green cell can be changed;
* Change the parameters at the top of the ‘FIRE’ tab. Make them appropriate for you
* Change the salary parameters on the ‘Salary’ tab. The idea is that your salary may experience stair step increases over your working life. This tab allows you to create those step increments;
* Add any debt you have on the ‘Debt’ tab. Enter one loan/credit line per spreadsheet line. Make sure to include the annual interest rate.
Warning
* Do not rely on this spreadsheet. It hasn’t been extensively tested or reviewed. However, feel free to test it, check it, and let me know where there are any problems. If you are really a retirement / numbers geek, PM me and I’ll add you as an editor on the spreadsheet.

If you think, I’m completely off base. Fork it! Make a copy tweak it, release it.
 
#Waterfall Approach

The spreadsheet uses a waterfall approach to achieve financial independence. Imagine different buckets (Emergency Fund, 401K, IRA, etc.). Spread FIRE will completely fill the first bucket (Emergency Fund) before it starts to fill the 401K bucket.

The buckets (in order) are:

* Emergency Fund
* 401K contributions to employer match limit
* Debt paydown
* 401K contributions to IRS limit
* IRA Contributions
* Large Purchase Savings
* Taxable Investment Account

If this approach doesn’t work for you, you can tweak the “Participation” tab. This tab controls what percentage of the previous bucket will be used. By default this number is 100%, but you could make “Emergency Fund” 50% - thus only 50% of the available cash would go into the emergency fund, leaving the remaining 50% to waterfall to the next bucket.

#Limitations / Simplifications

* To avoid a circular reference, the IRA deduction for tax calculation is from the previous year;
* There is no ability to change the tax filing status or exemptions in future years;
* The tax rate projected into the future is based on the current year’s tax rate;
* State tax is calculated on Gross Income;
* There is no IRA contribution phase out - have you seen the rules?
* Interest for debt is calculated on an annual basis;
* Debt is calculated using a weighted average; 
* Your salary in increased based on the ‘Salary’ tab. However, it increased based on the difference from the previous line. That is, your salary increases annual based on your “Annual Salary Increase” number. When there is an increase from the “Salary” tab, the increase in salary is added. This is actually a conservative approach. A more aggressive approach would be to calculate the future value of your anticipated salary;
* There is no allowance made for asset purchase or appreciation;
* There is no provision for IRA catch up contributions;
* Large purchase savings does not apply any interest rate;
* Taxes are calculated with 2015 tables taking just the standard deduction and exemptions;

#Notes

* You can plan for a large purchase using the ‘Large Purchase’ tab. Enter the name, amount, and when you want to start saving for the item. Since we’re using a waterfall approach, you’ll only save for the item if all of the previous buckets have been filled.

* Enter any debt you have on the ‘Debt’ tab. The tab will then calculate and use a weighted average interest rate.
Improvements

#Improvements
* Create an IRA to Roth Conversion formula. Based on the anticipated retirement age, starting N years before, begin converting pre-tax retirement funds to post tax.
* Create a savings rate and apply it to the large purchase savings (The assumption is savings should be in cash);

Please kindly remember I just did this for fun. No intentional mistakes were made (although there are probably plenty of mistakes to find). I realize there are may ways to save for retirement. This is just one. I've tried to make it flexible. No doubt there are other, equally valid, approaches. ~~If~~ When you find errors please constructively contribute to fixing and/or discussing them.",finance,1427829302

Bitcoin,Summary of the criminal complaint (of the undercover agents),"The government had multiple investigations into the Silk Road marketplace, an underground
black market that allowed vendors and buyers to conduct illegal transactions over the intemet. One of
these investigations was conducted in the Southern District of New York, and the other was conducted
out of Baltimore in the District of Maryland. Both FORCE and BRIDGES were assigned to the
Baltimore investigation and not the New York investigation. The two investigations were conducted
independently of each other.

Throughout 2012 and 2013, both FORCE and BRIDGES had significant responsibilities related
to Baltimore’s investigation. In this capacity, FORCE was the lead undercover agent in communication
with DPR. the owner, administrator and operator of the Silk Road website.l BRIDGES was the
computer forensics expert on the Baltimore investigation. In their capacity as members of the Baltimore
Silk Road Task Force, both FORCE and BRIDGES had significant exposure to and developed expertise
in the digital currency known as Bitcoin.

As will be described further herein, FORCE and BRIDGES abused their positions as federal
agents and engaged in a scheme to defraud a variety of third-parties, the public, and the government, all
for their own financial enrichment. With respect to former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
Special Agent FORCE, the investigation has revealed among other things that:

a. FORCE created certain fictitious personas - that were not officially sanctioned - to
communicate with DPR, the target of FORCE’s investigation. Using one of these
personas, FORCE sought to extort DPR by seeking monetary payment, offering in
exchange not to provide the government with certain information if DPR paid $250,000;

b. FORCE acted outside the scope of his official role on the Baltimore Silk Road Task
Force and created a fictitious persona named “French Maid.” Operating as “French
Maid,” FORCE fraudulently represented to DPR certain information concerning “French
Maid’s"" true identity and offered to sell DPR information about the government’s
investigation into Silk Road in exchange for approximately $100,000 worth of bitcoin,
which DPR paid and FORCE deposited into his own personal accounts;

Until October 1, 2013, DPR was known to FORCE and the rest of the Baltimore Silk Road
Task Force only by his online moniker “Dread Pirate Roberts” or “DPR.” Ulbricht was known on the
Silk Road site by the moniker “Dread Pirate Roberts” (DPR) and is referred to hereafter interchangeably
as “DPR” and “Ulbricht.”

c. FORCE stole and converted to his own personal use a sizeable amount of bitcoins that
DPR sent to FORCE in FORCE’s official undercover capacity and rather than turning
those bitcoin over to the government, FORCE deposited them into his own personal
accounts;

d. FORCE engaged in a series of complex transactions between various Bitcoin accounts
(known as Bitcoin addresses), his personal digital currency accounts, and his personal
bank accounts, including a $235,000 wire to an overseas account in Panama, all in an
effort to launder and conceal the true source of the ill-gotten proceeds;

e. FORCE used his official position as a DEA agent to illegally run criminal history checks
on individuals for the benefit of a third-party digital currency exchange company,
CoinMKT, in which FORCE had personally invested approximately $110,000 worth of
bitcoin;

f. FORCE functioned as the de facto Chief Compliance Officer for CoinMKT all the while
employed as a DEA agent, even allowing himself to be featured in CoinMKT’s “pitch
decks” to venture capital investors and allowing himself to be listed as CoinMKT’s anti-
money laundering and/or compliance officer in order to benefit CoinMKT (a company in
which FORCE had invested);

g. FORCE improperly directed CoinMKT to freeze one of its individual customer’s
accounts containing a large amount of digital currency, worth approximately $297,000,
even though he lacked a sufficient legal basis on which to do so, and FORCE then
illegally seized those funds and transferred them into his own personal account; and

h. FORCE used his supervisor’s signature stamp, without authorization, on an official US.
Department of Justice subpoena and sent the subpoena to a payments company, Venmo,
directing the company to unfreeze his own personal account, which had been previously
frozen due to certain suspicious activity. FORCE then sought to conceal evidence of his
improper use of an official subpoena by directing the company not to contact the DEA
and attempting to destroy copies of the subpoena. When the company did not comply,
FORCE asked another agent on the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force. an IRS agent, to
collaborate with him on seizing that company’s bank accounts.

With respect to former US. Secret Service (USSS) Special Agent BRIDGES, the investigation
has revealed among other things that:

a. In late January 2013, members of the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force, to include
BRIDGES and FORCE, gained access to a Silk Road website administrator account as a
result of the arrest of a former Silk Road employee. On January 25, 2013, the Silk Road
website suffered a sizeable theft of bitcoins, bitcoins which were moved into Mt. Gox, a
digital currency exchange based in Japan;

b. On February 12, 2013, BRIDGES formed and registered a personal limited liability
company called “Quantum International Investments, LLC,” (Quantum), and on February
22, 2013, BRIDGES opened an account at Fidelity Investments (Fidelity) in the name of
Quantum;

c. According to records obtained from Fidelity, BRIDGES funded his Quantum Fidelity
account exclusively with wire deposits from Mt. Gox in Japan. Specifically, between
March 6, 2013 through May 7, 2013, BRIDGES’ Quantum Fidelity account in the United
States received nine wire transfers from Mt. Gox totaling approximately $820,000;

d. Despite having personally benefitted in the amount of $820,000 from a Mt. Gox account
and receiving a large wire on May 7, 2013 from Mt. Gox, just two days later on May 9,
2013, BRIDGES served as the affiant on a multi-million dollar seizure warrant for Mt.
Gox and its owner’s bank accounts; and

e. Upon learning of the government’s criminal investigation into the Baltimore Silk Road

personalfinance,Have a somewhat different question about paying off some loans early.,"Hi personalfinance, long time lurker here, you guys are awesome! Ive never personally seen anything here that answers my question, but if there is please feel free to publically shame me.

Anyway, current I have some student loans and a car payment and a few credit cards which get paid off monthly. I have a great credit score, and Id like to keep it that way as Im hoping to buy a house in the next year or two. But I also hate having this debt, I can pay off one of the loans this month, and plan to do just that ($4500 owed, highest interest rate of my loans at 4.6%). My question may seem odd, but has anyone ever nearly paid off an installment loan, but kept a very tiny balance in order to keep the loan active? Would this benefit me, or hurt me? In otherwords, if instead of paying the full 4500, I paid 4475 and kept 25, not really having a payment on it for the next 3 years except the interest on 25 dollars. Im waffling about what this would or wouldnt do come time to apply for a mortgage, and whether (if there is any benefit at all) it is worth the effort. Thought maybe somebody with more knowledge than I could weigh in, or point me somewhere.

personalfinance,Almost got screwed by my Student Loan Servicer (My Great Lakes). Anyone have an Excel Document to Track Student Loans?,"First off, I have $25,000 in student loan debt. I loved every second of college and would gladly pay 10 times that amount and go back in time and do it all over again.

Until recently, I didn’t keep track of my student loans. I have 7 loans with varying fixed interest rates. I had auto-pay set up to automatically withdraw about twice my monthly payment amount from my bank account. I figured I was good to go and I'd pay off my loans twice as fast with my extra payments. Plus, directly on my loan servicer’s website, it says this: 

&gt; However, when it comes to extra payment amounts (see examples below), after all interest and late fees due have been satisfied, we automatically apply the extra amount to the unpaid balance on the loan with the highest interest rate (if there are multiple loans in your account).

A few days ago I decided to log in and see how things were going. What I saw was almost no movement in my loans. My 3 “low” interest rate loans (4-5%) had all decreased in value ever so slightly. My 4 high interest rate loans (7%) stayed exactly the same – wait what? 

I called.

After working through various reps and making my way up the totem pole, I finally found someone who knew what they were talking about. He had no idea why it says on their website that the highest paid loans are paid first. In fact, he said that’s the not the case at all. What’s more, my account was “paid ahead” almost $2000. They have been saving all of my extra payments and not actually applying them to any balance.

Needless to say I was furious. After talking some more, they finally agreed to re distribute ALL of my payments to the highest interest rate loans first, and re distribute all of my “Paid ahead” balance to the principal the month it was received. Catching this is going to save me nearly $1000. 

Obviously I can't blame this all on My Great Lakes as I'm the one who didn't keep track of my payments and where they were going... I just don’t want anyone else to be caught off guard by this like I was. Look over your student loans and make sure your payments are being applied in your best interest. 

Also, does anyone have an excel document, or some way of tracking loans to ensure in the future my money is going where I expect it to be?",finance,1427837967

personalfinance,Family financial situation not good - looking for advice.,"I know this forum gets a ton of these thread requests so I'll try and keep things brief and stick to the basics.

Debt-  
* AmEx: 22K  @ 15.24%  
* Visa:   12K  @ 24.24%  
* Visa2:   4K  @ 27.24%  
* Mort: 255K  @ 3.62%  

Asssets-  
* Home: ~550K (325K w/ mort.)  
* Trust: 350K (equity educational trust for kids)  
* 401K: 110K  
* Stocks: 30K (0 cost basis)  

The short version is that my wife and I had a combined income of around 120K 10 years ago. She was a lawyer and was the primary earner, for crappy reasons I've been stuck between 50-65K. We decided to have kids 8 years ago and due a to a medical condition she wasn't able to go back to work until we were finished. Now we have two happy and healthy kids and I've been trying to get her to go back to work which has been tough as she no longer wants to be a lawyer, which I had been banking on from a financial standpoint these last 8 years.
  

Over the span of these last 8 years I tapped into a trust/gift from my grandparents of around 400K in stock (0 cost basis so it was more like 320K). I stretched that as far as I could and it has allowed us to live comfortably and has let her tend to the kids like we wanted, but it's now run out.
  

We are fairly frugal but could tighten the belt some more, though it feels like it would barely make a dent in our current monthly budget.
  

A few questions I know I'll be asked:  

1. Yes it was unwise to sell the stock. I was young and naive about finances and it was a slippery slope. However it was important to both of us for her to be with the kids as long as possible instead of daycare/nanny.  

2. I should be earning more. For someone in my field with my experience I should be in the 100-120K realm. Know this and actively working on it.  

3. Wife needs a job. Easier said then done. Source of most fights.  

4. Stop living beyond my means. Agreed, but we are both smart people and should be able to get back into the combined 150K income realm to balance things out - getting back to that level has taken more time then anticipated.  

  

In the interest of full disclosure I do come from a relatively  wealthy family and will likely inherit a 7 figure estate when my father passes. As a result I'm not as much concerned about my retirement and schooling for my children (I know this is unwise - nothing is set in stone, but I need to prioritize for the immediate situation unfortunately). This is also how I mistakenly justified the selling off of my personal stock. 
  

I have a good relationship with my father but I think he is more  worse with finances then I am. Thankfully nearly all assets are tied up in real-estate managed by other family members and he just rolls along.
  

Options I'm considering:  
1. Selling the house and leasing. The market in my area is extremely high right now. If I had the money I'd be selling and purchasing a new home at this juncture. This would give us around 300K to invest and pay down existing debt as well as some breathing room.  

2. 2nd mortgage. Yuck. Just a band-aid to solve the higher interest credit card debt. Not even sure I'd qualify for a good rate with so much debt anyways.  

3. Tapping into the kids educational trust. This would just make me fell even more irresponsible then I already have been, but it's an option and that's why I'm here asking for advice.  

4. Moving. Pulling the plug and settling in a location with a much  lower cost of living. Probably more expensive then I'm imaging, still doesn't solve current debt.  

5. Family loans. Probably not with my father for reasons too deep to go into here. Uncle may be willing.  

6. 'Personal' loans. I know very little about these but the seem like an option of last resort.   
  

I know the immediate solution is the obvious: increase our income, decrease expenses and start paying down the c.card debt. As cliche as it sounds I really think I could benefit from some sort of consolidation loan where I can just budget for a single payment with a reasonable interest rate. Then cut up the AmEx and Visas and force ourselves to live off checking. I've looked into cards like Chase Slate and only qualify for 4K line of credit. Also worried about paying taxes this year as I sold the last chuck of stock early in the year and will have to pay for that. 
  

So that's the meat of it. I'm not the most financially savvy person obviously, but I've tried to do the right thing on one side of the situation, and painted myself into a corner on the other side. I know this is really a spoiled 'silver spoon' type of issue and there are many others who are way off then myself, but I'm still hoping for some advice on how to tackle my current situation regardless of my (potential) financial situation down the road.

**VIEWPOINT:**

* A path towards innovating nuclear energy

At the heart of the modern energy debate is a struggle between the need for more energy globally, while simultaneously achieving lower emissions. Nuclear energy is uniquely positioned to help respond to these duelling necessities, but innovative advancements must overcome considerable barriers, writes Todd Allen.

The topic of nuclear energy can be a polarizing one, but all sides agree that the nuclear energy sector could benefit from significant innovation. The industry can and should work together to address six key areas - improving communication; increasing private investment; designating test beds; modernizing regulation; stabilizing federal funding; embracing advanced technology.

From 3-5 March, more than 120 global energy experts met in six cities across the USA to discuss innovation in nuclear energy. Unlike typical conferences organized around a series of prepared presentations, these workshops were driven by small-group brainstorming about some of nuclear energy's most pressing challenges. The goal of these workshops was twofold: to gather input from energy experts that could help improve strategy and collaboration for innovating nuclear technologies in the USA and globally; and to start an ongoing dialogue among experts and laypersons alike about nuclear energy's role in the nation's energy mix.
