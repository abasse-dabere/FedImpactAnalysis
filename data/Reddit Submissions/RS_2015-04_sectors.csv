personalfinance,Student needs advice on if more loans is a good or bad idea!,"I'm 34, male, single, no kids. Live in an apartment with a roommate @ ~$570/month. Bills are maybe $100 a month.  Car debt: $13,000 @3.29% interest w/ 47 remaining payments. Payments are around $300 a month, and about 10% goes to interest. Health insurance is $70 a month. Car insurance is like $1,400 a year or so. I have about 10k in the bank. I'm in a full time graduate school program on 100% loans, I don't have any income. I take about $17,000 twice a year in federal student loans. I use this to pay for everything: rent, food, gas, school stuff, clothes, etc. This will put me at $136,000 in loans when I graduate in 2017.   None of my loans are subsidized - I think it's the HSC Fed Direct Unsub Loan. I think the interest is 6.8%. I already have about $4,000 in interest that's built up on it. I would like to pay off my car with my money in the bank and still have money to live on. I have the option of taking an additional $10,000 in loans per year with the Grad PLUS loan.  If I took that out, I think the interest is even higher, but I could pay off my car and then my only debt would be the student loans. Why do I want to do this? I would like to have the title to my car just in case anything happens with school or my health and I don't have the car taken away. Also, there's are a number of job opportunities that either have the government forgive your loan over a few years, or as part of signing an employment contract, they pay off a percentage of your loans for each year you work. BOTH of these options work the same if you have $100,000 or $200,000 in loans. It's all based on percentage of total loans. So, I should just max out my loans, right? We had a presentation at school where we were told that this actually does happen if you accept the right job. Even if I don't get in the program, I'm already gunna have $136,000 in debt, why not $146,000. or ever $166,000 and take out the extra loan each year for the next three years? Good idea? Bad idea? Am I missing a key variable here? Thank you!",finance,1427847328
personalfinance,Living Abroad with Home with PMI.. Refinance?,"Our only property in the US was purchased as a FHA loan with a 3.75% interest rate.

personalfinance,What to do with returned 401k balance,"Hey guys..  Long time lurker, but first time poster, and I could use some advice.  Had some 401k contributions from a previous job managed by Fidelity.  Before I was eligible for 401k enrollment at my new employer (initial plan was to roll into current employer's 401k),  Fidelity apparently decided that they were going to clear my account and issue me a check for the balance, since it was &amp;lt; $5000 and I had separated from that employer more than a quarter ago.  First..  I had no idea this was even a thing.  They claimed to have attempted to contact me on multiple occasions to inform me of this action,  but the last contact I received from them was more than 6 months ago with an updated prospectus or two.  

As annoying as this is, I now have to decide what to do with the (now post-tax) balance check. It's not a lot -  around $1,200. My thoughts so far and some background:

26 year old college graduate with about $35,000 in student loan debt spread out among 4 loans.  Three of them (totaling around $33,000), are on IBR and I currently owe nothing monthly.  The fourth (about $2,000) I pay a minimum payment of $50 monthly, and more when I can swing it, at the standard rate of 6.8%. I also have a credit card with a balance of about $1,500 with an APR of 22.24%. 
Lastly,  I have a couple thousand in a Betterment account that has typically been earning around 18-20% over the last two years. I typically add between $10 and $100 a month to this account. 

My options:

1. Pay the sum towards my credit card balance since it has the highest interest rate. 

2. Deposit the sum into my Betterment account to increase the compounding of earnings over the life of the investment.

3. Pay the sum towards my smaller student loan to decrease the outstanding principle. 

4. Use the money to open an IRA, CD, or some other long term ""way down the road"" account.

5. Some mix of the above? 

What do you guys and girls think?

Bitcoin,ANX distances itself from CoinMKT,"ANX, the Hong Kong-based parent company of US-based bitcoin exchange CoinMKT, is planning to distance itself from the exchange after the arrest of federal law enforcement agents on criminal behavior with bitcoins.

Two officers have been arrested for alleged bitcoin theft in the Silk Road case. Out of the two accused, Carl Force, a former Drug Enforcement Agent (DEA), was an investor with the exchange reportedly. He has been accused not only with theft of bitcoin, but also freezing client funds under the pretext of suspicious activity, then channelling them to his personal accounts.

In order to expand into the US market, ANX purchased the domain name and brand rights to CoinMKT earlier this year. The exchange said that the purchase of the CoinMKT.com domain was done in January, but it ""did not receive in the transaction any historical data, such as customer records, transaction histories, identification materials, or email correspondence."" Moreover, the alleged illegal activities took place ""well before ANX purchased the domain.""

personalfinance,Having trouble determining withholdings and take home pay for 2015 after receiving a large 2014 tax refund,"Hi good folks,

I'm reaching out to you all to hopefully help me shed some light on a subject that confuses the heck out of me no matter how many google searches I've made. I'm having trouble predicting what my 2015 tax burden is going to be - specifically, I know I got it way wrong in 2014 because I just received about $2k in federal and state refunds. This means that my gross take home pay has been out of whack for 2014 and I could have been using my money more efficiently.

I started my job in the summer of 2014 and was unemployed before that so it was difficult to estimate what my tax burden would be for the year. I'm trying to fix that now.

The following are some statistics about my situation going forward. Could someone please walk me through what I will owe, what I should withhold, and what all the terminology means (I mean, seriously, above-the line, below-the-line, deduction vs. exemption, etc. all makes my head spin):

- 24, Single, live in California

- $46,000 income

- Contribute 25% to 401(k) and 5% to Roth IRA

- No one can claim me as dependent

- Current take home pay: $814 bi-weekly

As you can see, my take-home pay is pretty low which makes budgeting for life difficult at times. My goal is to grow my emergency fund higher with a larger leftover balance.

Please let me know if you need more information and thank you for your help!",finance,1427858120
personalfinance,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I am looking for some insight on how to set up a budget while paying off student debt.","Hello Reddit. I am looking for some help or any advice on how to set up a budget and slaughter my student debt. I graduated with a Master's in Organizational Development 2014. Yes, just like ""the Bob's"" in Office Space. I am 25 years old, single, and have no children. I am starting my first job out of graduate school as an Admissions Rep. for a university in Arizona next week. My salary is $50,000/year. 

I have an interesting housing situation. After graduating I moved back in with my mom in Arizona. Since graduation, she has recently taken a job in Irvine, CA, so I am living in the house (free rent) for now. However, she is considering to rent or sell this year. I am not sure when this will happen. 

I have federal loans from undergrad and graduate school. They are disbursed into three different accounts. The first account is $45,000. The second is $7,000 and third is $7,000. I have rounded down for the sake of looking it up right now (I'm at work).  They are all fixed rates. My total loans equal $60,000 (plus or minus $200, I just made a payment). Here is a list of my monthly expenses:

Car Insurance $100
Cell Phone $80

Food $300
2 Credit Cards: $750 total

Amazon storecard $2300 with $2800 limit and $75 min
Cap One CC $1700 with $1750 limit and $45min
Bofa CC $500 with $600 $25 min

I pay a little bit more than minimum on each, usually $100 for Amazon, $60 for cap on, and $50 for bofa. The Amazon storecard has highest interest rate. It sat at 2300 for a couple months cause of interest charges but its starting to go down now. Now my question is, should I keep saving the $200 extra a month and pay off all the cc at once when I have enough or just apply the $200 to the credit cards each month?

I only have $300 in savings because I recently bought a car and put a down payment for $1000, I am excluding my car loan because it is not credit card debt. I can provide more info if needed.

UPDATE
I only work part time right now, I will be full time in 2-3 months, which will greatly increase my income to pay down this debt. I would make about $950 if I work full time. I also just became a lyft driver, I made about $300 last week working 3 days and $100 this week, but that went towards paying taxes, after that I should also have maybe an extra $200 a week from driving with lyft if I keep it consistent. Luckily I pay no rent and live with parents, but I would love move out and get an apartment with my girlfriend when I pay off this debt and become full time. I am 21 years old, if that matters.

Here is my Budget.
Average income is $700 bi-weekly at minimum after taxes, sometimes more. Expenses = $1150 not including gas or food

personalfinance,"Need to file tax returns for 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014; self-employed (owe taxes) - what is the best course of action?","I've been working as an independent contractor (freelance writer) since 2011 and have never filed a tax return. After reading some wildly inaccurate online sources from years ago, I've been under the impression I didn't have to file because I didn't meet the $10,000 threshold. This year, I have to file a 2014 return for an unrelated reason and discovered last week that not only was this not the case, but I'll actually owe taxes and various penalties because I'm self-employed. 

Unfortunately, there's no way I can afford a professional, so I'll be handling this myself and had a couple of questions. 

1) From what I understand, my 2011, 2012, and 2013 federal tax returns can't be electronically submitted. Are there online services that help you prepare them, then print them out? Also should I file 2014 first then worry about the others, or send all the returns in at the same time? 

2) I've had a lot of small one-time clients over the years. Some payments were sent to bank accounts that no longer exist, a lot of these clients have closed shop, and I did an awful job at keeping track of my finances in those earlier years. I plan on visiting the local IRS office for my wage and income transcripts. Is it okay that I don't know the exact amount as long as the income reported on my tax return matches what's on the transcripts? 

3) I probably won't owe more than $2,500 for all four years combined, but I can't manage to pay even a small percentage all at once. Is the IRS likely to offer a payment arrangement for a period of 36 months or more?
 
4) Will the IRS or state department of revenue do anything worse than assess me a boatload of financial penalties?

5) I've been trying to find out info on filing past-year state tax returns in Georgia. Is there anything wildly different about filing past state returns vs federal?

personalfinance,What is a reasonable interest rate for financing a used car?,"Basically, I'm trying to get an idea of **what a ""good"" interest rate is for a used car in the current market**, so I can get a good frame of reference when I get an offer. Or could someone tell me a reliable place to get such information?

I'm looking into buying a specific used car with low milage I test drove yesterday. I'm in my early twenties, my credit score is in the mid to low 600's, and my credit history is about 4 years old. I can put up to 4.5k down on this 10k car and financing the rest, though I was told many banks require you finance at least 7k so I may need to put 2k less down (though I would immediately pay that 2k into the loan).

personalfinance,Refinancing my home,"I received a letter yesterday from BOA wanting me to refinance my home.  Here is the run down.  I bought my house in Dec. 2010 on a 30 year fixed 4.375% Interest Rate.  Paid around 127k I believe... Currently owe 114k.  Home is valued at 170k on Zillow and 193 on Trulia.  Also, we have gotten flyers from Realtors in the area that other similar homes in our neighborhood is selling close to what Zillow said (I believe 168k was the last one I saw).

Current payment: Principal and Interest of $618.  PMI $85 Escrow $210.  Total payment of $912 a month.

They want me to refi at 3.875% Interest with $2855 in fees added onto the loan.  According to the nice paper they sent, Principal and Interest would be $552, I would no longer pay PMI (which I could probably get out of now anyway if I had an appraisal done) and Escrow stays at 210.  My monthly payment would go to $762.

According to my calculations, this would mean I would end up paying $7338.31 more in the end as there would be an additional 4 and a half years of payments.  However, the extra $150 a month on my budget does sound nice, and 25~30 years is a long time and a lot could(and probably would) change anyway.

Assuming the fees stay the same, 3.56858% would be the break even point (and bring my payment down another $20 a month).  I'd assume they would accept an interest rate between 3.875% and 3.56858% since they make more money.

Would they waive the fees?  I calculate they'd still make ~$2500more on the life of the loan based upon the payments extending out if they only did that.

What is PF's thoughts on this?  

*Should I refi?  

*Should I try to talk the bank into playing the numbers game with me to find an even better deal?  

*What is the most likely scenario to get this done?

I've been reading this sub for a while and have been interested in FI in general for over a year. I'm now at a point where I'm starting to take actions. I wanted opinion on a matter. 

I have a mortgage of about $43865 @ 10.25% interest rate, I pay about $623.54 monthly and have 108 payments due, that makes it about $67295 in the end if I continue with my 10 year loan.

The questions is, with these rates, does it make sense to pay off the mortgage in full as soon as I can? or do I invest in the market and continue to pay the interest on the mortgage?

personalfinance,Advice on Paying Down Debt / Retirement,"So I'm almost 2 years out of college at this point and I was just looking for some financial advising about the best way to eliminate my debt while still properly planning for my future. I am currently $123,000 in debt with student loans (I'll explain later) and have a full time job in the finance field geared mainly towards Financial Planning and Analysis / Budget and forecast. I graduated with a 3.2 GPA as well as studying abroad in Australia (I paid the same amount I would have paid for the semester at my U.S. School). I currently make $50,000 at my entry level position with 1.5 years experience at this point and I am 26 years old. I bought a gas efficient car a few months into being hired at my job for $13,500, my other car was going to shit the bed literally any day. I also sleep on my mothers couch to throw as much as I can towards my bills while trying to climb the salary ladder and ease my pain, but I have a girlfriend of 6 years who is as ready as I am to start taking our relationship to the next level so this will not be possible forever (nor would I want it to be).

Current financial situation:

Net Income: Approximately $2500 after taxes, benefits, and a 4% contribution to my 403b (minimum required to get an employer match).

Rent / regular living expenses: $0 - My mother's couch

Student Loans: Approximately $1,050.00 per month

Car Payment: $246.00 per month

Entertainment, Gas, Necessities: $826 per month

Extra income to disperse: $388 per month

Student loan breakdown

Privately funded loans: 1 refinanced loan for $79,000 @ 6.7% 15 year term
Federally funded loans: $44,000 multiple loans varying from 3% to 7% 20 year term

As things are right now I have been putting that extra $388 towards my car payment and have paid it down from $13,500 to $4,000. I know the loans are a much bigger priority with interest rates but I need the positive monthly cash flow as soon as possible if I am going to move out and begin my life soon. That being said is this a good strategy? Does anyone have any suggestions on where I should start and how I should attack this?

As far as retirement is concerned is this something I should put off saving for besides things like a 401k until my debt is paid off and / or paid down to a manageable level? When it is time to start saving for retirement what are the best options out there? Annuities? Stock Market? CDs? Etc. 

For those wondering a little background on what kind of idiot would put themselves in what seems to be insurmountable debt I started attending and taking college seriously when I was 20 years old. I had previously gone and dropped out 3-6 weeks into the semester two different times from 18-20 years old. I was a terrible high school student with no motivation, ambition, or guidance. 

Beforehand I was making minimum wage in a nursing home washing dishes with no future prospects in sight.  I had tried numerous attempts to get involved in trades but was not given the chance or was let go after summer jobs. No one in my family had ever attended college, and none of them could really give me any good advice on it or the true cost of it. I have a very supportive loving family and wouldn't trade them for them for the world, but I sure as hell wouldn't make any financial decisions based upon their advice. We were all ignorant and naive at the time I transferred from community college into a private school (Bryant University) thinking I would be making a higher starting salary with a great degree and not realizing the true cost of signing the dotted line. We all also know the loan companies are more than eager to get you to sign the paper work without truly explaining to you what you are getting yourself into. I am currently interviewing at new companies for potential $5,000 - $15,000 salary increases depending on proximity to the city. Should I be looking to take the money over the consistent experience?

We were alone and completely new and ignorant of the process and trusted our loan officer to help us along. We had $10k for a down payment that he told us not to bother with and that we should save. Well now we are stuck paying PMI. He told us once the loan hit 80% loan to value we could have it removed so it wasn't a huge deal, we knew We would hit the value really quickly and I liked the idea of having some savings to start out. We come to find out this is not true and it is for the life of the loan!!

Now I'm stuck, I don't want PMI anymore but I have an awesome interest rate (3.8% fixed 30 year). Does it make sense to stay with this loan and pay the $104 a month extra for PMI or refinance (rates are over 4% in my area now).

* 401k: I get a 50% match on up to 6% of my annual income, which would be $4,800. (They cap their match at a total of $4,000 per calendar year, but I'm happy putting in a little extra.)

* Bonuses: likely to get semi-annual bonuses, but I haven't factored these into my budget (based on company performance and my performance; company has paid out bonuses for the last 5 years)

* Debt: ~$26,000 in student loans, split into 3 pretty equal chunks and 1 smaller loan, with different interest rates that vary from 3.86% to 6.8%

* Monthly net income: ~$4,350

* Rent: $1400-1800/month -- My goal is to keep this around $1,600, but I won't know this for sure until I rent a place.

* Utilities: ~$300/month -- I think this might be less than I'm expecting; I'm in a duplex right now and the estimates I've been seeing for electricity in SF are much lower than what I pay now.

* Loans: $440 a month, making minimum payments on all 4 and tossing the rest at the loan with the highest interest

* Savings: $300/month to build up a little savings, then possibly slowing this down to focus on the loans

* Entertainment: $250/month -- Bowling, going to see movies, concerts, etc.

* Food: $600/month -- This is probably a gross over-estimate, but I'd rather budget too much than too little

* Insurance: $111/mo ($35 health, $5 dental, $8 vision, $63 to HSA)

* Spending money: $150/month -- clothes, books, movies, music, etc.

* Fitness: ~$100/month -- This will be reimbursed by my employer, but I need to be able to pay up-front.

* Sum: $3,851 out of $4,350 budgeted for, ~$500 breathing room (assuming $1600/mo rent)

Finally, I get a starting bonus of $10,000 after I've been there for a month, although [this calculator](http://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/salary/result) says I will probably only see about half of that after taxes. I will likely save half to start my emergency fund, spend a little on something practical (paying down a loan) and spend a little on something fun. 

The other ?-mark is transportation. I have no intention of trying to have a car in the city, and I imagine I will be commuting either on foot or by bus or BART, and a card for unlimited rides on both types of transportation (including street cars!) is $80/month. I will also be able to contribute a small amount of income pre-tax to a ""commuter account"" that I can use on transportation costs.

The problem with this program is that it is a 2-3 year program. It is NOT a post-baccalaureate master's program, but rather an undergraduate program with a fifth-year professional year tagged on that rewards a Master's of Occupational Therapy. The problem with this is that, having a degree already, I'm ineligible for many scholarships and federal grants. I am already $25,000 dollars in debt.

personalfinance,RSU and ESPP shares: Questions about sell-to-cover capital gains and wash sales,"Hi guys,

I've been having some trouble figuring out how to report some of my employee stock sales in 2014. 

A. **Sell-to-cover &amp; capital gains** My employer sells shares automatically to cover taxes when RSUs vest. Do these get reported on Schedule D just like a normal sale? Example:

* 200 shares vested @ $100/share

* 80 shares sold-to-cover...$8800 ""gross proceeds less commissions"" on 1099B

* entire $8800 went to federal and state withholdings, medicare, etc. on W2

* $20000 included as income on W2

I'm thinking my schedule D for this sale (*just* the sale-to-cover) should be:

* proceeds = $8800

* cost basis = $8000 = 80 * $100

* capital gain = $800

Is that right? This is based on my interpretation of [this post on the issue](http://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html).

B. **Wash sales, ESPP purchases, and RSU vesting** Based on [IRS Publication 550](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p550.pdf) (page 59), I think wash sales apply to ESPP and RSU incentives. However, how do I report this for the following situation?

12/1 ESPP purchase...107 shares

* cost basis (acquisition FMV, not discounted share price) = 87.05/share

12/9 ESPP sale...42 shares sold @ 83.555/share

* gain (loss) = (166.87) = (3.97)/share

12/15 RSU vest...37 shares @ 81.58/share

* 16 shares sold-to-cover @ 81.91/share


This is what I'm thinking, but it seems somewhat circular:

* 3.97 * (42 - 37) = (19.85) recognized as loss on 12/9 sale
* 3.97 loss/share included in basis for 37 12/15 shares
* --&gt; adj basis = 81.58 (acquired price) + 3.97 = 85.55/share
* sell-to-cover 16 shares @ 81.91
* --&gt; total gain (loss) = (58.24) = (81.91 - 85.55) * 16
* --&gt; (3.64) loss/share — not yet recognized due to wash
* increase basis of 16 12/1 shares by 3.64 going into 2015

personalfinance,How do I cover deductions in my changing paychecks while contributing the max to my 401(k)?,"I looked around this subreddit and didn't see my question answered anywhere. I apologize if it's been asked before.

According to current IRS rules, you can contribute 90% of your gross income up to $18,000 to your 401(k). My job pays me hourly, and the number of hours I work week to week varies greatly. My biweekly gross paycheck is anywhere from $250-$1250. Deducted from that are federal, state, Medicare, and Social Security taxes, as well as health insurance ($77), dental insurance ($5), life insurance ($6), long and short term disability insurance ($9). So basically every pay period I'm paying ~$100 in fixed deductions, along with the taxes that vary based on how many hours I worked that period. I want to maximize my 401(k) contributions, but if I selected the 90% contribution option then some weeks there wouldn't be enough left to cover the fixed deductions. I'm guessing there's some way to do this. Does anyone know how I maximize my contributions while making sure I can cover my fixed and varying deductions?",finance,1427910407

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt. Want to Maximize the effect of the avalanche method without changing monthly payments,"So assume i have 4 loans which vary in interest rate between 6.5 and 8% with total monthly payments equaling 600 dollars under a standard ten year repayment plan. A few months ago i had to dip into my emergency fund and wanted to give myself some breathing room with cash so i changed my repayment plan from 10 years to 25. My Emergency fund is recovering and I want to begin repaying under the 10 year plan again however, I am wondering if mathematically it is better in the long run to use the avalanche method while staying on the 25 year plan which lowered my monthly payment to 250. What i am thinking is that instead of switching back to the 10 year plan with their allocated repayments i keep paying under the 25 year plan and allocate the difference myself. So in total i will be paying the $600 but the majority of the extra payment would go to the loan with the highest interest rate until that is paid off and so on and then reallocate keeping my payment at $600 but tacking on even more to the remaining loan with the highest interest rate. The math seemed to work out making my interest about $1,000 lower over the life of the loans and life of loans shortened by about 8 months.

personalfinance,Low-interest loan: to pay off early or not to pay off early,"I have a low interest loan and am able to pay it off right now if I wanted to. I know the two competing arguments:

**Argument 1)** Hold onto the low interest loan if you think you can make more money investing in the market instead. All things being equal, you'll increase your net worth faster by growing your money at a rate that's higher than the loan interest.

**Argument 2)** Would you borrow money at interest in order to invest it in the market? Of course not, but that's what that amounts to. Pay off the loans first and then invest. 

I have a student loan of around $10k at a rate of around 2.8% (close to the historical rate of inflation!). Interest is not tax deductible. I have money sitting around I could use to pay it off without digging into my emergency fund. 

I've been abiding by #1. When I was keeping a very tight budget, I funneled all of my extra money into savings for a medium term goal I had, but I've since decided to abandon that goal, and the money I used to put away has just been sloshing around my budget without a real job. Occasionally I take extra money and put it into investments, but it's not a disciplined habit. This is making me think that I'm not ""taking the money I'd otherwise use to pay down the loan and investing instead""... I'm just holding onto the loan with no real plan.

My grandpa passed away a few months ago, and I was included in his will, and he left me $400,000 AUD. I realise I am very very fortunate to be in this scenario, and that is why I want to ensure I will be FI in the near future. Before this happened I had $45k in my bank account, with no student, credit card, or car debt, so I have a total of $445k, debt free. 

Recently I decided to buy a 2 bedroom apartment in Sydney for $625k. I paid a 20% deposit ($125k), and keep the rest of my money ($320k) in the offset account, which offsets the mortgage interest. The mortgage interest rate is 4.79%, which means I pay ~$720 every month on interest (on the $180k still owed to the bank). It also means the $320k I have in my offset account is saving me ~$1275 every month.  I currently live in the master bedroom, with my good friend living in the other bedroom. I am receiving $290 a week from my friend, and I estimate I can rent out the master bedroom for $360 a week if I move out.

The numbers:

- $625k two bedroom apartment in Sydney

- $445k/$625k paid off ($320k in offset account)

- $720 in mortgage interest every month @ 4.79%/annum

- Master bedroom rents for $360/wk, other room $290/wk

- I live in the master bedroom, and pay myself ""rent"" every wk

- I make $65k a year before tax

- I estimate expenses are $25k a year, excluding property costs

- I have a crappy paid off car. It gets me from A to B, which is good enough. I don't plan on upgrading anytime soon

- I have absolutely no debt at all, apart from the mortgage: $180k

- If I continued living in the master bedroom, I would make $440 a month from renting to my friend. Minus strata and other expenses, I probably break even. I am therefore living in the master bedroom for ""free""



So my questions for you guys:

1. What is my best course of action to take if I want to retire at age 30? How much will I need to retire?

2. If I were to take out some or all of this $320k, where can I invest this money for a better return? My current return on this $320k would be 4.79%, because it is offsetting interest which I would otherwise have to pay.

3. Would $50k AUD of passive income from investments every year be enough to retire overseas in Asia? Eg Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, etc

Wife wants to buy a home, parents want us to buy a home, I'm just sitting here confused.","Sorry for posting this in a throwaway account, I'm a little embarrassed that I've made it this far in the educational system and still don't understand an ounce of finance.

I'm about to graduate and have a job lined up. My wife is very, very excited and adamant about the prospect of purchasing a home. I can't fully blame her as we've been living in a small apartment for the past 8 years and she's antsy to have a real home. My parents are also pushing for us to buy a home, but in all truthfulness, they've never been very financially savvy and insist that owning a home is the ultimate in financial security. I'm not entirely sure that's true given the volatility that home ownership can bring, though.

My wife is looking at homes in the 4-600k range. In our area, this is a mid-upper priced home. We could easily find a nice home for 200k, though. I think we can financially swing it, but my instinct is that we should keep living as if we're poor for a few more years since we really are in the hole quite deep, and in a view starkly contrasting my wife's opinion, that we really are poor. I'd like to continue living in our apartment ($700/mo) and put every spare dollar I can towards my student loans until they're at least significantly smaller, if not fully paid off. The brief synopsis of our situation:

* wife earns 38k/year with a steady government position
* Job offer is at 220k/year with a 15k sign-on bonus (emergency medicine position in a nearby ED)
* no appreciable savings other than 8k between an IRA and a 401k and 6k in our savings account
* just shy of 400k in student loans ranging from 4-7% interest rate

My wife keeps insisting that we're soon going to be pulling in 20k/mo before taxes and that we can start affording more luxuries in life. I have a very different viewpoint in that we're still significantly poorer than the average person and we really can't afford this. Who is right? Can we afford a home? Is it at all the responsible thing to do? Is my inclination that we should continue living in our apartment, despite our soon-to-be large income, so that I can pay down my debts?

Edit - I lied. Approximately 45k of the 400k student loans is at 11% interest, deferred from my undergraduate loans. I would like to pay that off immediately, of course.

Edit 2 - Thanks to those of you with helpful comments. Those who keep replying that my wife is a gold digger/wants to spend 'my' money/etc., you're reading way too much into her wanting a new home. She wants to live in a certain area. I don't blame her, it's a nice area and we've lived like dog shit for the past 8 years. Luckily, we went through this thread and she agrees after seeing the countless comments that this is something that should wait. Compromise initiated, we're going to look at some nicer apartments. I certainly can't deny that as we live in a borderline-dump of an area right now. Thanks much for the help, glad to hear I wasn't crazy.",finance,1427916136

My husband already has an additional $160/month extra taken out because my disability wasn't taxed each payment, so we did that to help off-set what I would owe.  Here is a run down of this tax year and what 2015 calculator is telling me:

2014

His income: 80K

My income: 8K

Disability: 12K

Prior to putting the 12K in TaxAct, we were getting just under 3K back.  After putting in Disability, we are getting $1,200 back from Federal. 

We paid 9,900 in Federal taxes.


For 2015:

His income: 82K (he received a raise)

My income: 40K
 
We've always filed Married and 0 as we have no dependents.

According to the calculator, we can expect to pay $17,600 in Federal taxes and in order to not owe, we need to take out $400 total more a month out of our paychecks.  This also accounts for the amount we are going to put in the non-employer retirement account.  Even if I opened a Vanguard account and we maxed both, we'd still owe.

Is this correct?  I am discouraged because after reading this sub for a long time, I was so excited about saving for retirement and getting an emergency fund and it seems that we are paying a lot in taxes.  YNAB has already helped so much and I learned about it here. If it makes a difference, we are in California.

personalfinance,"I'm 23 years old, about to start a $75k job, and I am considering buying a house. How can I make the most of my $75k and what do I need to do if I want to purchase a house?","I am a 23 year old single guy, graduating college in May with a master's degree in Computer Science, and will be working in Boulder, CO with a $75k/year software engineering job. I currently have no debt, but no real savings either.
According to http://www.taxformcalculator.com/tax/75000.html, I will take home just over $53,000/year after taxes, which is about $4,417 per month.

I am about to be making more money than I've ever had in my life, and I am wondering what to do with it. I would appreciate any advice on the matter, and if you think my thought process is flawed, or that my estimations are off at all, please say something! Here are my expenses:

I will most likely rent an apartment for somewhere between $700 and $1000/month, which will be my largest expense. With utilities, groceries, gas, car insurance, entertainment, clothing, etc. I will probably spend about another $1000 per month. I'll be liberal and add another $200 per month for miscellaneous expenses. All told, I believe I could live in Boulder very comfortably for around $2200 per month. So with a take-home pay of 4,417 per month, I'll have roughly **$2200 per month to save.**

Now on to the important part: what should I do with the $2200 per month I have to save? My ideas are as follows, but I would really appreciate suggestions, since I'm very new to this.

The first $209 per month will definitely go to my company-provided 401(k), since they will match up to $2500/year. I may contribute more if people here suggest it. So that leaves me with $2000 per month to save.

I have definitely heard that creating an emergency fund is important, and that it should contain about 3-5 months worth of expenses, so my first 3 months of savings will most likely go into building that up. So at the end of my first 3 months of work, I should have $6000 saved in my emergency fund.

At the end of the first 3 months, I will start saving for other purchases, and my thought right now is that I would like to buy a house as early as possible, so I can turn my monthly rent into equity. Why pay rent that you never get back when you can put that money towards a house?

In general, I would like to know if buying a house is a good idea for someone as young as me, and if there are other things I should be saving for as well. If I put all my extra savings toward a down payment on a house, I could buy one within a couple of years, but I also have to consider the possibility that I may need a new car in the next year or two. Since I'm currently 23 and debt-free, I'd like to avoid going into debt just to buy a car. I also may want to travel, and I can set aside any extra money I have left in my budget, and my bonuses, for that purpose, but should I make this a higher priority?

I know I will have to go into debt to buy a house, but the question is when? Should I save until I can make a 20% down payment to get the best possible loan interest, or should I buy one as quickly as possible by taking a loan with a smaller down payment but high interest rate?

/r/personalfinance, I ask you these questions in the hopes that you can help me start off right, and so that I won't make any big errors with my money. I'm young and inexperienced, but I really want to learn. Let me know what you can come up with!

investing,Bond ETF reactions to interest rates,"So, I understand the mechanics of buying an individual bond, and its relation to interest rates. However, its unclear to me how it works in an ETF, which has many bonds with many different maturity dates. 

In an environment where I expect interest rates to rise, then I would probably want an etf holding a higher percentage of short term bonds, right? But then again, long term bonds must have higher yields to account for uncertainy/risk...

If higher interest rates are a proxy for economic growth (or at least inflation), then are bond etfs counter cyclical, sort of like gold? In other words, if I expect sustained interest rate increases for the next few years (as an example), should I bother to buy bond ETFs? (timing the market etc, aside)

I hope i'm not trying to oversimplify something that's more complex. Clearly i'm clueless, so any clarification is appreciated.

It's a straightforward calculator that will spit out how long it will take to pay off all your loans, total interest paid, and recommended payments each month. The recommended payments is really the only complex part, aside from all the If statements, but those were mostly done out of vanity to keep it looking clean. If you look at the formulas, it is recommending monthly payments by taking into account both the size of the loan amount and the severity of the interest rate.

personalfinance,"CA teacher with over $150,000 in student loan debt considering bankruptcy","I owe over $150,000 in student loans. I make $47,000 annually as a public school teacher in California (yes title 1 school that would potentially qualify for government relief on the back end of my loan)

Intro
Basically, I paid for all of my schooling with student loans and didn't think twice about it. Then I graduated and went on unemployment, started 3 jobs and was laid off 3 times in a row, and I'm finally stable (about to finish my 2nd year in a row for the same employer). Throughout the tumultuous start to my career, I went through various spouts of unemployment and subbing, causing me to apply for deferment through my loan servicer, etc. I never made a dent in any of my student loans, but I did take the time to consolidate the federal ones. I honestly don't really remember the details of doing this, other than which job I had when I made the effort to get my loans figured out. Too bad that only helped my federal loans. I didn't do a very good job of communicating with the private lenders.

Anyway, now that I am stable, I find myself being hindered by my poor credit score. It finally affected me when I was denied the house I was looking to rent because my student loans had gone to collections, and it was dinging my credit every 30 days.

I pulled my credit score and worked chronologically from the first loan, calling lenders along the way to verify. This is what I found out I owe....

What I Owe:
Federal - $67,200
6.8% interest rate
have been consolidated already with some of the original private loans
currently on deferment (2 year max)

Private - $25, 947 + $58,650
The first amount was traced from my credit score, and it came from the same servicer as the other private loans, but when I called the original servicer, they could not tell me which collections agency took the loan over...they suggested I wait for the agency to contact me.
The second amount is being held by a collections agency. They split the amount into different accounts, with one amount getting a 6.23%, and another getting 7.33%
The company requires 25% of the sum as a down payment ($14k in my case), with a 5-year payoff ($1141/month)

The Dilemma
I bring home around 3,000 per month. I don't have 14,000 dollars for a down payment. I have pleaded with the collections agency. They told me bottom line, the lowest I could pay monthly is about $420/ month but I would only be paying toward the ever-growing interest.

The federal loans, which do not have anything to do with private loans, want (income-based) $350/month.

There is a third loan that is still unaccounted for, but just with these two loans, I'd be paying 1/3 of my paycheck toward student loans. How can I be expected to pay for rent, car, groceries, phone, living expenses, and then have a family, a future, a wedding, or any major emergency with 3k per month?

Options
My first option is to just rearrange my budget, rent a small shack behind a crack house, etc. etc. all the advice people always give. I'd do all I could to pay the collections people every month, but they would never go away because I'm only paying interest.

Option 2: Chapter 7 bankruptcy. I've been researching this a lot and think I have a shot because I'm a teacher, and teachers are notorious for making no money. This is where I think I could possibly argue the undue hardship clause under chapter 7 bankruptcy. I simply don't make enough, and my job isn't going to suddenly pay me way more, and I'm not planning on changing jobs. I just don't know if a judge would say, ""Hmm you're only 28. You could go become principal."" But how would I get approved (or why would I ever want to go through the torture again) for a loan to go back to school for an administrative credential? What if I philosophically or spiritually feel like I belong in the classroom? Is there an argument there for my unchanging financial state? I suppose these questions are more geared toward the #legaladvice subreddit.

Option 3: Lose all hope, do nothing, and wait for the lawsuits to pile up.

Does anyone know anyone who has successfully discharged (fully or partially) a student loan in bankruptcy? I'm looking for some guidance, personal experience, anything.

I have no money skills or concept of the mess I have gotten myself into. Please help!",finance,1427951675

For example, if you have a 100k mortgage at 4% and can earn 7% I come up with this...

You will pay about $8,995 annually for 15 years to pay off the mortgage.
As a result you can invest $100,000 and earn 7% on that while taking out $8,995 annually to leave you $49,890 at the end of 15 years.

OR

You could invest $0 and add $8,995 annually at 7% giving you $226,013 at the end of 15 years.

gaming,"Poseidon: Master of Atlantis (PC, 2001) has the best story of any game I’ve played (long post)","I first played Zeus: Master of Olympus when it was new in 2000 and really liked it. It’s a city builder with a mythical-classical setting. The gameplay was great and went really well with the style, story and setting.

I recently discovered an expansion had been released in 2001 - Poseidon: Master of Atlantis, so I bought that and have been playing it for the last few weeks. The gameplay is still really fun, and I like the graphics – I think they’ve aged well. But the story is where it shines most, a mythical alternative history of Atlantis’ rise to power. It’s the most exciting, engaging story I have ever seen in a game – even though most of it is delivered simply as narrated text in between missions. I summarised it because I loved it so much and thought I’d share here. It's not a short summary. Sorry, I got carried away.

**Spoilers ahead**

-

In Poseidon: Master of Atlantis you challenge the power of the gods and oversee the triumphant rise of a doomed empire. In six campaigns you build Atlantis’ cities and colonies on the principles of military might, trade and science. Atlantis will come to dominate the known world from the Eastern Mediterranean to Central America, but eventually the full tragic story arc will bring their world crashing down around them. 

-

In the first campaign the first settlers arrive in Atlantis, a continent in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. This is also home to other, more powerful races – the Centaurs on the land and the Oceanids (mermen) off the coast. However, your people feel favoured, as they are led by the demigod son of Poseidon – Atlas, who strives for recognition from his Godly father.

Terrorised by Centaur raiders but blessed with rich and fertile plains and exotic minerals, a small city blossoms despite adversity and begins to fight back for the oppressed humans of the continent.

This city is named Atlantis, the eponymous first city of the nascent Atlantean empire – it is not a coincidence that the Atlanteans name their first city after the continent; it is a clear claim of ownership on the land.

This city then sets the irresistible course that no Atlantean city will ever be able to break away from - giddy booms of conquest and exploitation followed by the inevitable busts when the impossible becomes unmanageable. 

But for now Atlantis is in the ascendant and defeats the Centaurs. But here the Atlanteans go too far, and annihilate all Centaurs on the continent. After the slaughter, and much too late, the Atlanteans make a terrible realisation. The ruined Centaur cities are full of culture and riches - the Centaurs were not the crude beasts the Atlanteans had taken them for. The Centaurs of Atlantis were a race favoured by the gods, an equal race to humans, and not a warlike race of mere beasts.

Atlantis was built by the human will to attempt the impossible regardless of the consequences. The hubris of Atlantis was a cornerstone of their civilisation. Literally. This stone is called the Symphonia Ithikos - a stern censure, etched onto rock, issued by the Gods after the genocide of the Centaurs. 

The warning was clear - The power to destroy a race is the preserve of the gods alone. Do not overstep your limits again.

The Oceanids assaulted Atlantis mercilessly in fury at the destruction of the Centaurs and secure in the knowledge that the Atlanteans couldn’t fight back, as doing so would risk the Gods’ wrath.

Atlantis made countless appeals to the Gods, partly to undo the damage and partly in a daring bid to elevate their demigod founding father, Atlas, to join the pantheon. Eventually they did so much, and built such lavish monuments and increasingly vast pyramids in flattery of the Gods, that they achieved their unbelievable goal. The founding father of Atlantis, Atlas, became a God.

Atlantis and its colonies were battered throughout this time but grew stronger and richer regardless, and after many years the Oceanids’ attacks relented. Soon after, trade and friendship began. 

The resolution of the Oceanid problem was the first example of another trend - time and time again the Atlanteans would face animosity from those who feared their growing power, but this could be overcome by Atlantean trade and knowledge. They sought to subjugate their competitors using economics and science rather than military power. This was true right up until the Atlanteans met their nemesis - a much weaker group of humans they couldn’t buy off or conquer. But that wouldn’t happen for many thousands of years. For now, Atlantis grew.

-

With Atlantis booming but in need of more resources, the second campaign sees the Atlanteans establish a Western base, Autoch, and found colonies in the lush jungles of South America. They do so despite resistance from a number of lesser Gods. Hephaestus and Ares have tricked the native people into believing that they are the chief Gods and don’t want the Atlanteans to prove otherwise. 

The two Gods launch attacks against Atlantis’ colonies but are rebuffed by appeals to more powerful Gods, including Atlas. He also helps build great pyramids to awe and pacify the natives.

A great maritime empire blossoms, centred around Autoch. Atlantis is so rich that it has resources to spare – and as in all times of plenty, infighting inevitably follows, with Autoch straightening out its competitors within the empire and emerging as the unchallenged first city of the western Atlantean Empire. 

-

The third campaign begins with a realisation. The entrance to the Mediterranean Sea is impassable by ship but could - maybe - be opened up by a demigod of great strength. Beyond the straits of Gibraltar lie the riches of Phoenicia, Egypt and Greece, tantalisingly out of reach.

The Atlanteans establish a new city, Lixus, on the tough land around the Mediterranean entrance, and petition Hercules to open up the strait. Hercules does so in return for a great variety of rich Atlantean goods. 

Like opening Pandora’s box, the Atlanteans have no idea what they have set in motion when they enlarge the strait and connected Atlantis to the world beyond. 

Immediately, tensions flair as the Atlanteans make their mark on the existing power structures.

The Greeks seek to limit Atlantean trade, and start sinking Atlantean ships. Atlantis calls this piracy; the Greeks say they are protecting their own trade rights.

War follows - the first of many between mighty Atlantis and tiny Greece, an epic conflict that will rage for decades. Atlantis quickly subjugates Egypt and Phoenicia and their powerful ships clear the Mediterranean, but Greece resists. Atlantis continues to push, asserting that the Greeks just need to be made to see reason – since life is better under Atlantean rule.

The Greeks ally with the Centaur cities of the north, and retake much of the Atlanteans’ recent gains.

Lixus founds colonies, a fortress at Syracuse near Greece and a breadbasket town at Saqqara in Egypt, where they again use their trick of impressing and subduing the natives by building pyramids. 

The war continues, and the Centaurs are giving Greece an edge. Phoenicia and Egypt suffer as the battleground between Greece and Atlantis, but all Greek gains are suddenly forfeit as a terrible plague spreads through their ranks. Lixus is barely affected due to their excellent knowledge of medicine. 

Around the same time, the Oceanids cease trading, their settlements slowly decline and eventually fade away. 

The scene is set. The Mediterranean is open for conquest, but Lixus and its colonies can’t do it on their own. A shadow is growing, the stage is set for a vast new city to lead Atlantis to total victory over Greece.

In the fourth campaign, the Atlantean empire takes on the entire Mediterranean. A new city, Clietos, projects the military might of Atlantis to Egypt, Phoenicia, Greece and beyond. No city can resist, and the list of Atlantean vassals grows inexorably. 

By now the standard life cycle of the great Atlantean cities is clear – like great flowers they grow from the land and blossom magnificently. But what do flowers do after blossoming? They spread seeds, then wither and die. 

But the huge boom of the Atlantean empire, and their unchecked military expansion - including the development of a superweapon with Ares’ assistance, angers the Gods. Zeus sides with the Greeks to protect them from the Atlantean armies. He rebuffs their forces and causes tidal waves to wreck Clietos’ coast.

In their most stunning feat of hubris so far, the Atlanteans continue with their invasion plan. They oppose the chief God by appealling to Zeus’ wife, Hera, to distract him long enough for them to mount their attack on Greece. 

By this point the Atlanteans have realised that the Greeks will not submit to be conquered and they may not get another opportunity like this. So they take no chances and destroy the Greek cities with Atlantean fire instead. Greece is ruined. The Atlanteans have won, as they always knew they would.

When the dust settles, the Atlantean empire controls the known world. Clietos is a vast parasite, bloated and overpopulated, unable to feed itself and leaning heavily on its vassals to provide for it. 

The city of Atlantis was badly damaged in the war but even before then was a shadow of its former self. It has not aged well, starved and stuffed and sagging from the booms and busts of its Empire’s turbulent history.  

In the west, Autoch has declined as its South American colonies overtook it and distanced themselves from the old Empire. 

Lixus was never as big as the other great cities, and its small size has made it more able to survive as the guardian of the mouth of the Mediterranean where it still stands. 

Now with no one left to conquer, the Atlantean Empire stagnates.

-

Now we see things from the perspective of the Greeks. In the fifth campaign they repopulate their ravaged homeland. Atlantis abandoned the land after destroying it, and so the new Greek cities spring up unchallenged. 

This is a time of naïve regeneration - distinct from the weight of history that precedes it. There is a sense of opportunity, enthusiasm and youth.

However, monsters have moved in. One by one, the new cities are snuffed out by the dreaded Chimera. Leaders in Greece become accustomed to receiving urgent messages for help from their neighbours, but they can do nothing. When the Chimera arrives no city can resist annihilation. 

But it seems like for every city that is destroyed, another one or two spring up elsewhere, and so the growth of Greece continues albeit under a permanent curse. One city, Lycia, on the eastern side of the Aegean sea, expands dramatically and unites Greece in a trade network. 

This growth is different from the Atlantean type. The land can support all the needs of the people, so Lycia doesn’t need to continually expand and import until it bursts. There is no need for a mad rush of conquest. It becomes a great city in its own right.

But then, disaster! The inevitable happens and the Chimera strikes. But Lycia breaks the grip of the beast when it finds a great hero to finally defeat it - Bellerophon. He goes on to defeat the rest of the monsters in Greece. He believes himself unbeatable, and attempts to ascend to Olympus to claim his rightful place amongst the Gods… and is unceremoniously stripped of his power as punishment for his own personal hubris. 

But his work in Greece is done. Finally, almost nothing can hold the Greeks back from achieving their full potential and regaining their historic power.

Nothing but the Atlantean empire.

-

The sixth campaign jumps forward in time to the desperate last stand of Greece. A small mountain city, Mycenae, is the sole bastion holding out against the Atlantean Empire. The Atlanteans have established a new base on Knossos off the coast, and from this fortified city they have reconquered Greece. Sparta and Athens fell with shocking speed, and Mycenae clings to freedom by a thread. 

Isolated, battered and outmanned, the Mycenaeans build walls and slowly grow their strength in the mountains. Time and again the Atlanteans fling huge armies from Knossos to smash the city but cannot ever quite take the Palace, and time and again they are repulsed, though the cost to Mycenae is massive.

Then, slowly, slowly, the Mycenaeans begin to fight back. They retake Athens. Not for long - they immediately lose it again to Knossos. But the trend is clear – Mycenae now has the strength to attack, not just defend. The Greek cities flip possession several times, but eventually Mycenae liberates both Sparta and Athens and has enough men to spare to defend them against further Atlantean incursions. 

A few years ago, the idea of attacking Knossos would have been ludicrous, but now it seems possible. Smelling Atlantean blood, the Centaurs emerge from the north to join forces with Mycenae. 

However, Knossos remains impregnable, its defences are comprehensive, and all attacks are swatted by their fire towers. So Mycenae enlists a hero – Achilles - to cripple their defences before launching a massive joint attack with Sparta’s help. To the Atlanteans disbelief, Knossos falls. 

Here, the Greeks make a mistake. Rather than conquer Knossos, they destroy it. With this act, they bring the wrath of the Atlantean Gods crashing down about them. 

Poseidon smashes their ships, causes earthquakes and tidal waves and sends the Cyclops to kill them. Although the city survives, as it always has, the lands around Mycenae are now so badly damaged the city can never again be as strong as it was when it reunited Greece. 

So they colonise the empty land at Knossos. From here, a new Greek city grows with a vast new army to launch against the Atlantean lands in Egypt. Atlantis fights back from their own new city called Thera, and they launch relentless attacks on the fortified walls of Knossos, trying to break through and turn back the Greek gains…

personalfinance,Student loan question,"So I graduated about six months ago, which of course means that it’s time for me to start paying off my student loans. I have two loans: one of 2,820.66 with a daily interest of 3.86% and the other of 2,770.35 with an interest rate of 4.66%, bringing my debt to a total of 5,591.01. I am currently working full-time as a copywriter and earning enough to pay off 150 every paycheck, maybe even more if necessary. I have about 6,000 saved up and about $450 worth of credit card debt. My credit card is interest free at the moment. 

My real question is, **how should I approach paying my loans off?** I have a couple of ideas: 1) Using my savings to pay off both loans immediately and then replenishing my savings 2) Using my savings to pay off one loan or just 3) Paying off the loans month by month.

personalfinance,Buy a New House in Good School District or Stay Put and Pay Down Student Loans?,"I'm not sure how much information is helpful, but I really don't know what to do and would like some perspectives.

* Spouse and I now make around $135k/year.
* We have a kid about to start school (will start Fall 2016).
* could buy a home in a great school district  - $245k at 3.75% (or better?), and we would have the %20 downpayment with the sale of our current home
* great credit
* spouse has $95k in student loan debt
* current neighborhood schools have low scores at elementary level, low scores plus gang/other violence at middle/high school level
* **Edit:** our monthly mortgage payment would increase from $716 to around $1400 (30 years) or $1600(20 years); we also have a couple low car payments amounting to about $300, preschool costs (although this expense goes away when kid enters public school), regular monthly bills (water, power, cable, etc).

So that's where we are. Stay put and try to pay off the student debt ASAP, but we'd likely have to send our kid to shitty schools, or move and get him in a better environment.

Also, the move would bring us closer to family who are helping with childcare, cut down on spouse's commute, more space, etc. Interest rates on mortgages are low now, and I expect them to be higher when we'd be done paying off the student loans.

I am very uncomfortable taking on the larger mortgage, with those student loans (part of it at over 8%) over our heads. But I also feel we have a responsibility to get our son into a safe and productive environment for school if we can.

personalfinance,Consolidating debt with high income/credit ratio. Anyway to fix this?,"Okay, so I am a recent college grad and I just landed my first big girl job. I make 37k annually (entry level job), but I have great health insurance, a matched 401k, disability, PTO, etc. I'll get yearly raises, tuition reimbursement for masters programs, etc. so for someone in their early 20's, it's not too bad. 

Well, 18 year old me was a bit stupid and applied for a credit card and got a super high limit ($3000). Catch was a 26% interest rate. Now, I knew nothing about interest so I just said ""okay!"" and went for it. Of course my parents weren't there and I never really told them. Well, it's maxed out now (~6 years later), as well as another $900 card, and my minimum payments don't even make a dent. I pay $200 a month on both cards and over 50% of what I pay goes towards interest only. I'm sure that $4000 isn't a super high amount of credit card debt, but for someone with no other credit, it has ruined my ""ratios"". Tack on my car and student loans and my credit to debt ratio is ridiculous. I can manage my payments fine and I absolutely don't touch those bad boys now that I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, but I really can't pay anymore on the cards due to me now owing student loan payments. 

I went to check on loan consolidation because interest rates are in the low teens to single digits sometimes, but I was denied at Wells Fargo due to those maxed out cards. I completely understand why I was denied, but I feel like I will never get those debts off my back at this current interest rate and without them lessening substantially, I am not eligible for any credit line increases which would help my score substantially. 

Based on this information, should I really try to refinance or consolidate (maybe with a co-signer), or should I just keep making the payments I'm making and increase my payment amount as my student loan payment amount decreases over the next couple of years?

personalfinance,Graduating next month and put together my first budget. Can I get feedback on it?,"Hi everybody! First time posting here but I have been lurking a lot and it seems like a great place (super helpful sidebar and FAQ). 

I will be graduating in May with a BS in Chemical Engineering, and have accepted a job across the country (moving from the northeast to the pacific northwest) which will pay $65,000 annually. This will include a signing bonus and relocation package. The bad news is that I am also ~$95,000 in debt from student loans (if only I knew better 5 years ago when looking at colleges...). In addition to this, I will be replacing my car as it's a 2001 Cavalier that is falling apart and not worth the repairs it needs at this point.

I calculated my adjusted gross income as being $54,950 after accounting for a standard deduction and personal exemption, resulting in a bi-weekly take home pay of approximately $3,860 after Federal taxes, social security, medicare, and my healthcare costs. No state taxes where I'm moving to. Based on this I have put together a monthly budget which is listed below:

* Rent: **$900**

* Utilities: **$150** (all utilities including internet, no cable).

* Groceries: **$200**

* Student Loans: **$1,400**

* Car Payment: **$350**

* Car Insurance: **$150**

* Gas: **$100**

* Misc. (Netflix / Spotify / Gym Membership): **$27**

* Emergency Fund: **$250**

* Christmas/Vacation Fund: **$50 each**

* Free Spending Money: **$100**

**TOTAL:** $3,750 including a couple of minor things I haven't listed above.

**NOTES:** 

Right now my rent budget is assuming I will live by myself in an area that gives me a ~15 mile commute. I'm perfectly fine with that because it's an area I want to live in. However, I am looking more into Craigslist and having a roommate to bring that cost down. So far I've been Padmapper, Zillow, and Apartmentsearch to find one bedroom apartments in the area I will be living in. The utilities are also a rough estimate at this point.

As for the car situation I would like to purchase a new car because I would like to drive out across the country and purchasing a used car isn't as enticing to me because I like the idea of having a car that hasn't ever gone through winter, and won't experience one anytime soon. The insurance is a guess at this point, I need to figure out exactly what I'm going to buy (Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla are at the top of the list) and get quotes from there. I hope to pay that off in 5 years, and my student loans in around 7 years, if not sooner if possible.

What do you all think? Are there categories that are too high / too low? Areas that I can change to be in a better position to be debt free sooner?

Presently, I am a Ph.D. student in mathematics at a major university, but I have recently decided to leave the program and pursue a career in data science.  I don't have the necessary skills yet, so I applied and was accepted to a 12-week immersive program in a large city.  Like all of these types of programs, they provide comprehensive training, working with real data supplied by sponsoring companies, and the program culminates with interview preparation and a job fair.  From my understanding, my employment chances upon completion of the program are very good.  

However, the program costs $16,000 with $5,000 due to reserve a spot in the program. The cost of relocation would make this amount higher.  They have scholarships available and payment plans, but I'm not certain of the exact nature of these.  I have been a graduate teaching assistant for the last five years, making a meager $18,000 annually.  Thus, I have not been able to build a savings, and so I need to finance this in some other fashion.  

I have explored a number of options for this.  First, I applied for a loan at meetearnest.com.  Unfortunately, they do not lend to people in the state where I live.  I have applied for loans at so-fi.com, prosper.com, and lendingclub.com, but despite having excellent credit (a 798 score) my applications were declined because of my low income.  I have called each of these companies and attempted to explain that my income will increase significantly in the near future.  Only so-fi.com was willing to amend my application, and I'm awaiting their response.  

I have also looked at banks (Bank of America, Navy Federal, Wells Fargo) as potential lenders.  Unfortunately, these banks do not have a partnership with the program, so I am ineligible for student loans.  Additionally, they report that they are not able to lend any amount in the form of a personal loan for the purposes of education.  

I desperately want to make this happen, but I'm out of ideas.  So, r/PF, are there any other avenues that I am not considering?

For part of last year I made money doing various odd jobs (babysitting, cleaning, driving, sewing, errands, etc.)  Of course, with Tax Day less than two weeks away, I finally decided to start looking into how I can report the income I made without W-2s and 1099s.  As I understand it, I will need to report all of this income using Schedule C (and Schedule SE, in order to calculate the amount I need to pay for SS and Medicare, etc.) because apparently I'm self-employed?  I didn't keep the best records and will need to go back and look at receipts, etc., but I did a quick run-through using rough estimates and it looks like I'll owe a fair bit of money on the money earned from these jobs ($1K or so.)

I did have some other W-2 jobs and so I do have some withholding there (around $1K.)  My main concern is that I JUST discovered that I was supposed to be making estimated quarterly payments, and so obviously I didn't do that for 2014, which means that I'm probably going to end up paying a penalty (unless I can get that waived.)  Does anybody have any advice on the penalty for underpayment of estimated quarterly payments?  I know ignorance of the law is not an excuse, but will the IRS consider a waiver because my failure to make the estimated payments was not willful?

Beyond all this, depending on what I owe, I probably won't be able to pay in full by April 15, so I anticipate setting up a payment plan.  That's fine and dandy...I'm happy to pay the IRS what I owe.  My only concern is that I have been accepted into grad school in the fall and am in the process of applying for federal financial aid (student loans, etc.)  Will owing money to the IRS (even if I have a payment plan established) affect my ability to qualify for/receive financial aid?

So now I'm making $500 payments on a luxary car that I don't need. I have no idea what the interest rate is, but I do know that it's ungodly. To date I've paid about $20,000 on this car and it was originally  $28,000. Due to some missed payments what is currently owed is about $25,000. I have no idea what to do. 
My family had a falling out so I can't get any information of my grandfather's to talk to the financing company. I need my grandpas social to even begin speaking about it but I can't even get that. I'd be more than happy to turn the vehicle in, and pay the difference of what is owed vs what the car is worth but I have no idea how to do that without my grandpas information. I've even thought about defaulting on the loan but my grandpa worked so hard to build his credit I couldn't stand to do that to him.
Any and all advice would be appreciated. Sorry if this turned more into a venting rant than anything else.

TL,DR: Got a loan in my grandpas name for $28,000. Interest rate and late penalties are so high, even though I've paid $20,000 I still owe about $25,000. Please help.",finance,1428030439

finance,Thoughts on whole loan trading market/funds?,"Hey... Throwaway account obviously.  Curious about any educated thoughts on distressed whole loan trading funds?  

I actually have an interview coming up with a well established fund (several billion AUM, &gt;20 year track record) in their whole loan trading group but I've never had that much exposure to RE let alone whole loans.  

For background, I'm an associate in trading at bulge bracket.  Been here for 4 years and focus on cross-product portfolio trading (generally speaking I work with a lot of your vanilla products: equity, both listed and otc eq options, corp and conv debt though only limited amounts in the distressed or structured facility space, and a bit with cds and var swaps generally with respect to risk/hedging).

Questions I had were:

- I see most white papers out there are usually by funds talking about the huge amount of distressed whole loans still on balance sheets, does this indicate despite where we are in the credit cycle there is still ample room for these funds to find value?

- The fund high level model focuses on picking up distressed whole loans, service to performing, and securitization for offloading.  Is this the standard approach these PE funds take?

- From what I understand, lending banks generally package bundles of whole loans for clusters of sales in which there's a multi-day bidding process.  Can anyone shed further light on the details of this process?

- What kind of implications can a sustained rising interest rate environment have on these funds?  The fund has a quant desk focused on managing IR risk through what I assume are OTC IRS's, but on the loan market as a whole do periods of higher default rates (usually associated with rising interest rates) negatively impact performance of these funds?

I know this is a lot of questions for a very niche market, but just hoping someone might deal in the space.

personalfinance,"I'm someone who didn't have an emergency fund, and could really use one right now","I left my software engineering job last year without any savings, to start a startup. I had to leave the US within 10 days, so I moved to my wife's home country, and managed to find a part-time + remote consulting job that pays pretty well ($120 USD/hr). So I thought everything was going to be totally fine. We were living rent-free with my wife's family, but we were helping them out quite a bit with groceries and gas bills, etc.

So my visa is just about to expire. We've bought flights to Thailand and paid a deposit on an English teaching course for my wife. She'll hopefully be able to get a job teaching English in the next few months. I still don't have any savings. But I thought, no worries, I'll just do a little extra work in March, and we'll be fine. So I do about 40 hours, and I'm looking forward to $5000 that we can use to pay the rest of the tuition, as well as a deposit for an apartment.

Welcome to the world of consulting, where clients sometimes don't have enough money to pay you. Even though we initially agreed to around 40 hours per month, apparently he wasn't expecting me to do that much work this month.

I got a $500 loan from [LendUp](http://lendup.com) to cover some urgent travel costs, which has a very ridiculous interest rate. My credit card limit is only $600, and the balance is over $500 now. My client has said that he'll try to pay me ""partially"" in the next few days, so not sure how much that will be. But I've just applied for a bunch of other part-time jobs. I have a tax refund of around $5000 coming in the next few months, so I only wish that I had filed sooner.

Also, how did I manage to spend over a year working in San Francisco for $120,000 per year, and end up with no savings... Goddammit. I had a lot of fun, though. And apparently I own around 0.1% of a company that's now worth over $500 million, but I can't touch any of that until they IPO or get acquired, which is many years away.

I think that's one of the main reasons why my attitude towards savings was so fucked up. I didn't understand why I should be putting away seemingly small amounts of money instead of going out all the time and enjoying life, when I had the promise of this big payout coming in the future.

I've noticed a pattern where I keep saying ""I should really start saving"" whenever my back is against the wall, and then nothing changes. Lots of excuses. Last time, it was the $4000 medical bills I had to pay (after insurance! God bless the USA).

So I'm also worried about what will happen whenever this company has an IPO. Should I get a financial advisor then? I worked with a guy in San Francisco who sold a company when he was in his early 20s. He had millions, and blew it all on super expensive apartments and failed business ideas, and now he's back to square one. So I don't want that to happen to me.

Anyway, that was a bit of a tangent. If I can't chase up this client in the next few days, I'm probably going to have to cancel this trip, postpone this English teaching course, and move back to my parent's place in my home country until we can get back on our feet.

personalfinance,Questions regarding taxes for US citizens living abroad,"I had a few questions I was hoping I could get help with. I've searched the internet and found conflicting information.

&amp;nbsp;

First, a little background. I'm living abroad right now. From January 2014 to December 2014 (tax year, right?), I spent at least 2 months within the US. I understand that this means I will not be exempt from Federal Taxes.

&amp;nbsp;

My first question concerns state taxes. My residential address is in the state of Oregon. I also have a PO box in the same state. I use it for essential mail and things like this. However, I have not been living in Oregon for over 12 months now. Do I have to pay state taxes in Oregon? I've heard that if you can prove you've lived outside of the state for more than 60 days you are exempt from state taxes in Oregon. How do I prove this? Do I attach revenant information to my taxes?

&amp;nbsp;

I've also heard that US citizens who are living abroad receive a 2 months extension on their taxes. Is this automatic? Will it even apply to me considering I was in the US for 2 months last year? If it is not automatic, how may I file for an extension?

&amp;nbsp;

My last questions concerns deductions. I have also read that travel expenses such as flights, hotels and living accommodations can be written off. How true is this? I would appreciate it if someone could provide information regarding specific deduction costs for US citizens living abroad. Some of the information I found was sketchy. Thank you very much!",finance,1428042858

Credit Card - 6k (0% Intro, until around the beginning of 2016)
""Personal"" Loan - 19k (2.99%)

The minute details are underway (and easily researched), but I'm looking for feedback on my broad strategy.

I'm hoping to pay off the credit cards before the end of the summer, using essentially all of my pay increase and some cash on hand, as well as cutting back. A lot of the credit card bill is due to a cross country move and a newborn two months earlier than expected.

After that, I can't decide if I should move on to paying down the student loans or personal loan. My intuition says the personal loan, since the minimum monthly is higher, so if I can pay it down by (optimistically) the end of next year it frees up more income to put towards the student loans.

The vehicles weren't the best decisions I've ever made, but right now we don't have enough equity in them to get rid of them. I'm more than willing to after a few years.

Going forward, I want to start investing, with sort ""FIRE-lite"" goals. My loans have relatively small interest rates, so my intuition says I should sort of balance paying them off and investing. 

I'm a military member, so my employment is about as secure as you can get. So, I don't think a 6 month emergency fund is as much as a necessity, but I do want 2-3k so that the credit card issue doesn't arise again.

Column A (federal) = $74375, Column D (total amounts) = $76975.

However, on form 540NR, line 17, instructions say it must match schedule 540NR, column D. But line 17's calculation is federal AGI ($74375) plus additions ($1300) = $75675, which does not match my column D answer. It is off by $1300. I'm not sure what line 17's value is supposed to be.

&gt;The risk-adjusted returns of intermediate bonds (that is, returns relative to volatility) have historically been stronger than those of both long-term bonds and short-term bonds.

We went to the NEX because that's where are the junior enlisted and retirees buy all their crap. (At least it wasn't USA Discounters...) The short of it is, we were told that I should apply for the card instead of him because he's only allowed so much credit under the UCMJ, so that's what happened.

Well fast forward a year and a half, he got booted for being a jackass. The credit card was getting paid on-time above the minimum until he got busted and half-pay. Our household went from $2200/mo to $900/mo with no warning. (He /really/ pissed his command off.) Welp, it stopped getting paid at the time that total was $4400. I paid what I could and they have been taking my taxes teh last few years. (About $800 since I've been under/unemployed the vast majority of that time. Most of that was EIC.)  Well here it is a few years later and I've been shipped off to Transworld who is pretty much fucking evil. Now through some glorious bullshit AAFES can garnish my taxes, apparently this store-card is somehow ""federal debt"". Things never explained when you sign up. 

My question is, does anyone have any experience dealing with these people? Transworld has tacked and extra $3k onto my bill saying it's ""interest and fees"" and I feel like that is total bullshit. But I have no idea where to even start. If bankruptcy was an option, I would try it. But they want me to pay them several hundred dollars a month, that I simply do not have.

personalfinance,"How would you calculate a personal loan with a fixed interest rate, but that had a variable payment amount and loan life?","Hi All, 

I am thinking about making a personal loan  to a friend, and we agreed upon a fixed interest rate, but we wanted to make the payments flexible to what they could afford each month, and the life of the loan would then be variable based on their payment amounts, would this be a decent way to calculate it?

I was thinking that I would follow basic loan formula, and divide the interest rate by 12 months.  (4.5% / 12 months would be .00375 monthly rate) Then multiply that monthly rate by the balance of the principal each month.  As long as the payments are more than the interest alone, this should be a safe way to calculate it, right?

personalfinance,Tax Question: Am I screwed as far as non-resident tax for sale of a property?,"First of all, I realize that this is a very dumb question, and I'm sorry to subject you to my dumbness.

* In November of 2013 I was forced to move out of state.
* My property had been owned and resided in by me since 2010.
* It took me until August of 2014 to get my property on the market, for a variety of reasons.
* Escrow opened and failed once, ending November of 2014.
* I'm currently in escrow.

I was just made aware that I need to pay an additional $14,000 in taxes on the sale of the property because I am no longer a resident of that state, since it took so long to sell.

My sense is that there is no way around this, but since it's such a large sum I felt I might as well check. 

(I do not have to pay federal taxes because it was my primary residence and then it was vacant. I also am not in the position to do a 1031 exchange.)


EDIT: OK! I did some research and my real estate agent is wrong. I am being given a *withholding tax of 5% the gross sales amount.* The actual income will be taxed upon my filing of a state tax return, and it should be less than that. This is far more sensible.

As for avoiding the state income tax, it does not look like it's possible in Hawaii. Hawaii does not seem to follow the 2 out of 5 year rule but instead a one year prior rule. I would LOVE it if this was wrong though, please someone correct me... :)",finance,1428078634

personalfinance,Should I cancel my card before I buy a home?,"Hey everyone, I have a general understanding of how credit works and everything but am just looking for advice from some credit gurus/experts. 

A little background: My credit score 652. My wife's is at 690 something. I'm in my late 20's and I have two student loans (one with interest and one without) that amount to $20,000. The plan is to just make the payments on those as they come because the interest rate is low and should be good for building my credit. I only have one credit card that is a joint card with my wife and I just got it below 30% of my limit, after having it above 90% due to unemployment after law school, which I believe is why my credit score is lower than I would like. It had been much higher. Now working with a firm so no problems with that anymore.  I have been preapproved for a new card which I am accepting and also will probably get a store card (Target) as well. The one card I have has me at a credit history of 2 years and 7 months. My wife and I are considering buying a home in the next year as well. Also, my wife has three cards and one of them is a Shell credit card that is a joint account with her parents. It is her oldest card and has her history at over 4 years. 

With all that said I have a few questions: 

1. I want to keep our credit limit down because we do not really use credit cards too often and I want to be able to keep my usage at below but around 30% of my limit. So I want to get these two new cards and get rid of my joint card with my wife. This would effectively erase my short credit history. What is your advice on doing this with the thought of buying a home in the next 6 months to a year? If you think I should not get rid of it and just not use it, then do I keep the extremely low balance on it now and just pay the amount due as the bill runs in? Or should I wait until after we buy a home, then pay off the card and cancel then?

2. I do not like the idea of my wife being on a credit card account that she no longer even has a card to but also does not control payment. Her parents have never missed a payment on anything but it still feels wrong to me. Should I get her to cancel this account with her parents even though it will knock her credit history to around 2 years when she got a CapitalOne Venture Card?

3. Any experience with CapitalOne Quicksilver and/or Target RedCard Credit Card?

I just really need some advice guys. If you have any general advice on the student loans or potential first mortgage I will gladly accept that as well. Thanks...

TLDR: Worried about how canceling cards that I want to replace and/or don't feel comfortable having, will erase my entire credit history and 2 years of my wife's 4 year history right before we buy a home in the next 6 months to a year... (See credit score above)",finance,1428080484

solar,Quick question - how do I tie in a pure sine wave inverter to the main house supply? Also some clarification questions.,"Hi there all,

So currently I have a house fed by a 100-150A (back in the days when electric heaters were a thing) with a decently slopped roof that I want to throw some solar panels on. The rough idea is to have the panels on the roof (about 1.5kw worth), and then run 1/0 or 2/0 down two stories to the garage, where the inverter and the batteries (looking into a good 10 or so, depending on price when I buy). This is also where the main panel is. I am wondering, how would I go feeding the solar power into the existing wiring? I understand there are some options for a transfer switch, to switch between mains and solar, but ideally I would like a system that didn't require a small power outage whenever we switched. Would I need to run the mains into a charge controller, that into the battery bank, and then that into a inverter that was powering the existing mains electrical? If so, how could I get 100A out of a inverter? Or am I missing something here? Just a note, theres about 100A worth of circuits in one box, then a bunch of not in use (as in terminated with wires cut) 30A lines for heaters in a subpannel.

Bitcoin,...And The Good News: Banks Will Be Obsolete Within 10 Years,"Every few centuries or so, an amazing new technology comes along that fundamentally changes human civilization.

There are so many other examples throughout history. The Agricultural Revolution. The Industrial Revolution. The invention of the printing press.

The printing press was a particularly interesting parallel for what’s happening today.

Before the printing press, people were living in the dark. Their information was heavily controlled, and they were forced to rely on the ‘authorities’ for personal, financial, educational, and spiritual guidance.

The printing press changed everything. It was an extraordinarily powerful social technology that spawned entire political revolutions and the rapid advance of human education.

In Europe, the number of printed books went from millions to literally billions.

Suddenly information became extremely difficult for governments to control. Ideas became unconstrained. Antiquated political regimes were brought down. And intellectual achievement flourished.

We are now in the early stages of a brand new transformation brought about by yet another technological advancement—the Digital Revolution.

And it’s changing everything, from how we do business to how we meet and engage with one another.

Most importantly, the Digital Revolution has created the ability to bring together literally millions of people and spread ideas quickly and efficiently. Information cannot be controlled.

This has the power to make entire industries obsolete. And banking is one shining example.

‘Modern’ banking is still based on the same system that has been in existence for at least a century.

Yeah, sure, they all have websites now. But this doesn’t make them high-tech.

At their cores, banks are still 19th-century fractional reserve institutions that take in money from depositors, make irresponsible loans and investments, keep razor thin margins of safety, and beg for bailouts when the system breaks down.

And along the way they find every opportunity to screw consumers.

Moreover, commercial banks have de facto control over entire economies.

They nominate representatives to serve on the boards of central banks, who in turn establish interest rate policies and give free loans right back to the commercial banks with money that they’ve conjured out of thin air.

The system is incestuous and obscene. But now things have changed.

Today, every possible function of a bank, from savings to loans to money transfers, can now be done faster, cheaper, and more efficiently by new technology, courtesy of the Digital Revolution.

Websites like Transferwise or Azimo make it possible to send money across the world at negligible cost.

Social media sites provide the opportunity for people to exchange currency with one another without the need of an absurdly-priced money broker.

You can also obtain a loan or investment capital online from crowdfunding sites now, whether its for your startup company or mortgage for your home.

And you can even move your savings out of the banking system altogether—whether to new digital currency platforms, or something ancient and traditional like precious metals.

All of this technology already exists—it’s just a question of how quickly it will be adopted.

Unsurprisingly, millennials are leading the charge.

According to a report by (ironically) Goldman Sachs, 33% of millennials surveyed said they don’t expect to need a bank in five years, and 50% are counting on tech startups to entirely overhaul banks.

And I expect that in 10 years’ time, the technology and adoption will have progressed to the point that today’s banks will be entirely obsolete.

Thomas Jefferson once wrote that “. . . power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.”

It took two centuries. But now it’s actually starting to happen.

investing,In Depth look at the last major US deleverging (1934-1956) - Or why interest rates will remain low for the next 20 years and its effect on stock prices,"TD;DR at the bottom

Below imgur link is a table showing various metrics for the economy and stock market for the period 1934-1956).  There's a lot here so I recommend reading the guide as you look at the table:

http://i.imgur.com/vTJ7zU3.png

Guide:

*First thing to look at is (IMO) the most important metric in the economy:  ****Total Credit to GDP ratio****.  You can see it goes from 235% in 1934 to 127% in the mid 1950's.  This metric drives interest rates, which in turn drives stock market valuations.

As long as the economy as a whole is deleverging, interest rates remain low because no one is willing to borrow..  You can see that once we were done delevering, and started to lever up in the late 1950s, that interest rates started to rise as well.

*The next metric i use is the 10 year E/Y, which is just the inverse of the shiller PE.  This basically says ""what is the coupon for the stock market as a whole""...next we compare this to the current 10 year yield.  Basically showing:  how does the expected yield of the stock market compare to the yield of treasuries.  If the stock market yield is lower than the treasury yield, the stock market is overvalued, and visa versa.   Simple, but imo more valuable than just looking at Shiller P/e etc.   You need shiller P/E that also accounts for interest rates

*Now this metric can't predict FUTURE interest rate changes.a stock market may look cheap now at 3% treasury yields, but if treasuries go to 20% tomorrow that changes the entire equation..  Risk free returns are 20% so the 3-5% stock market E/Y looks horrible...stock prices drop.  

*combining all this, we can use total credit to GDP to predict the future approx treasury yields, and then use to to arrive at what stock market E/Y should be at in the future.  We can say that as we continue to delever from 360% total credit to GDP (2009) to say something around 200% or lower in the late 2020's or 2030's, that 10 year yields will still be below 3% in 2030, and that in turn means the shiller P/E will likely be quite high around then (above 25)

*The final step in predicting stock market values is looking at what rate Earnings have grown at and what they are likely to grow at in the future.  over the past 50 years, earnings have grown about 6% a year.   Assuming shiller P/E remains unchanged over the next 20 years, the stock market should grow around 6% over the next 20 years...Stock market doesn't appear overvalued to me

**Tl;DR: US economy will continue to delever into the 2030s, which will keep treasury yields below 3% or so, which will keep Shiller P/E relatively high (above 25), which means stock market will likely grow 6%/year from these levels for the next 15-25 years...perfectly in line with 6% per year earnings growth.  Stock market not overvalued.**",finance,1428089216
personalfinance,Should I take a loan from my 401k to pay off credit card debt?,"I currently have a little over $5,000 of credit card debt between two cards.  $4,000 of it is on one card with an interest rate slightly over 20%, the other currently has no interest but in less than 3 months it will no longer be interest free and I will have to pay the back interest from a year ago when I started it.  

I have been contributing to a 401k plan for a few years and have roughly $45,000 in it.  I am thinking about pulling out $5,500 and paying it back over the next year to eliminate the credit cards altogether.  I have done some research on it, and am getting mixed opinions on 401k loans.

personalfinance,Getting a private student loan for the summer - planning to repay within a few months (X-post from r/studentloans),"Hi pf!

I've planned to get a private student loan this summer - it's the first and only one I'll get, and I'm getting it only because all other financial aid has been exhausted . I planned for this; summer school is generally not affordable (since we don't get aid in the summer), and in the past I've barely made it work. 

This year is my last summer in school; I'll graduate next spring. This summer semester is a study abroad that I've wanted to do for years (and so have planned it for years). It's directly related to my major and graduation requirements, and it's essentially a once in a life time opportunity. I'm 27 years old, will be starting a business later this year, and just won't get this chance again. I'm not thrilled about getting the loan, but the end with justify the means. I've thought it through, so please refrain giving advice that I just shouldn't do it or shouldn't get the loan, or should wait until next year, etc. Lets just assume I absolutely need this in order to graduate. 

I will be coming into a fair amount of money within 6 months (insurance payout). I was hoping it would come in sooner, so I could pay for the summer and not get the loan, but that's not how it's worked out. 

The plan is to pay off the loan entirely within 10 mos - as early as July 2015, and as late as January 2016. 

I need $6000, and I'll assume the worse at getting 9% interest. I need a cosigner for this loan and interest rates vary. 

So $6000 @ 9% comes out to ~$50/ mo in interest. (Rounding up). If I pay it off in July, thats less than $200 in interest. In January, it'll be closer to $600. 

I haven't found a bank to get the loan through yet - my cosigner refuses to use Sallie Mae, so I'm looking at Wells Fargo.  I do not like WF, but I'll do what I have to to get this done. (Any recommendations would be AWESOME. All private loan lenders seem equally awful.)

I'm uncertain what fees and penalties I'll incur paying it off that early. From what I've found, there isn't much info about it - it seems unusual to pay it off entirely before they even expect payments. I plan to just go into a WF and discuss it, but in the mean time, I'd love some feedback and insight. 

Also, should I go for a variable rate over a fixed one, knowing I'll pay it off so soon? (I was planning on fixed, because it can easily get out of hand going the variable route...)

Lastly, it's worth mentioning - I have poor credit. I don't make a lot of money (FT student with a PT job) and have no savings. If I could use the Lendingclub or something, I WOULD. This seems like my only option, unless someone here wants to loan me $6k @ 10% interest... ;)

My financial state is this way in part because I was in a car accident last year. I was working 2 jobs at the time, and lost 1 job over the injuries and healing time. I have a claim with the insurance, I've got an attorney, and things should be settled no later than 6 mos from now. (There will be a decent pay out.)

All in all, timing just hasn't been on my side since this accident. I've barely made it by financially, and I really don't want to miss out on this summer because I'm waiting for the settlement check. 

**TL;DR: Will be getting a $6000 private student loan to cover my last summer semester in college (undergrad). I'll be able to pay it off in full within 10 months - how should I go about this?**

personalfinance,Halp. Low paying job I love in NYC. Need help planning and budgeting. Law school debt up the wazoo. How do people live in this damn city?,"Hi PF,

I am 26 years old and went straight through from an elite liberal arts college to a T-14 law school. College was paid for all by my parents, law school was paid for all by my loans. I got my dream job in a public interest position. I live and work in downtown Brooklyn making 58k before taxes. I can't seem to save money to save my life.

On the one hand, I feel far too old and too educated to be living paycheck to paycheck. On the other, I've only really been in the work force for six months. My parents helped me out with living expenses while I was studying for the bar, so I'm only in debt to the extent of my credit card (about $1800) and my law school (a metric fuckton...AKA $250,000 in federal loans.)

HOWEVER, my law school loan repayment is fantastic. They cut me a check for my payments every six months. Provided the law doesn't change, after 10 years in my field my student debt will be forgiven (I graduated in time to be grandfathered in under the new law, so I have a decent chance of this happening.) So, in a sense, I don't really have to pay back a dime of law school.

Right now I am putting $100/ paycheck into my 403-b. After this and healthcare my paycheck is about $1690 twice per month.

I rent a two bedroom in Brooklyn. I'm the only one on the lease. I write the $2600 check once per month and my roommate pays me $1200. (Before you yell at me for this, please have a basic understanding of NYC housing market....although I concede I could work harder to lessen this burden.)

I am not saving anything. I try to keep a grand in my savings at all times and it is a struggle to do even that. There are some areas I know I could budget better: food (I get takeout too often when I'm busy), social life (one night out per week in NYC can run you upwards of $100 in drinks and a cab ride), etc. My monthly expenses include the gym ($75), internet ($60) and renter's insurance ($10.) My biggest random expense is Amtrak- up to my family in BOS or down to my bf in DC. I only support myself and a cat. So why can't I seem to save anything?!?!

I hope this doesn't come off to whiny and privileged. At this point I don't feel like I'm spending on any extravagance.

If anyone else has dealt with a low paying NYC job, what were your ways to handle it? I want to avoid credit card debt (I'm not so bad right now because my limit is $2k so at the very least I won't rack up too much) but I also want to have a social life and stay in my current field. 

I don't think taking a second job is realistic. I work about 60 hours per week plus night and weekend arraignment shifts (so from 5pm to 1am or from 9-5 on saturday or sunday) about three times per month.

My husband and I are looking at buying a single family house in Seattle. We each have three years job history and combined make $143k gross. We have an emergency fund of around $25k, fill our Roth IRAs fully every year and both use our company’s 401ks past the matching. 

Our only debt is two car payments, around $800 per month total, both with low interest rates (0.99 and 1.99). We track our spending with Mint, and save between $2000 and $4000 per month depending on discretionary spending (2014 averaged $3500). We currently have $75k available for a house down payment and other associated costs. 

Houses in our area cost between $350k and $450k for what we are looking for. There are not options of going smaller or cheaper, that is the lowest end in our area. Our current townhouse rent is $1750 per month. Between 2010 and 2013 rent in the Seattle area increase 11%, and home prices in our area increased 7.2%.

With the Seattle job market booming, it’s not likely there will be a drop in the home prices any time soon.

I start my new job post-graduation on June 1st. I will be making 67k annually and I owe 47k in federal student loans (5.8% interest). I am going to consolidate my loans in May to qualify for IBR using my last year’s income. I only earned 6.7k last summer, so I expect that IBR will lower my payments to next to nothing for 12 months. Using my 2014 tax return and the IBR calculator estimator, I determined that I will need to make $0 payments for 12 months. 
After deducting taxes, health and dental insurance, and 401k contributions of 6% of my income, my take home pay will be approximately $3968 a month. Here is a breakdown of my budget:

Rent:  $843
Electric: $108
Water: $35
Internet: $55
Renter’s and Car Insurance: $58
Gasoline: $75
Food: $175
Entertainment: $35

Beauty: $25
Misc.: $35
Misc. Savings: $250
Car Maintenance: $150 (This is just another line of savings in the event I need a car repair)
Emer. Fund: $2000

I plan to build my emergency fund up from June until December to save 7 months of expenses. Starting in January 2016, I plan to keep the same budget except I will be directing $1600/mo towards my student loans, and the remaining $200 split between $150 for Misc.

Up until now, that included an $11,000 loan at 7.25%. I recently worked to refinance that, and since my parents were willing to co-sign for me, I was able to lock in the lowest rate the lender offered (3.5%). So now, I would guess my average interest rate on my loans is about 4.0%

Up until now, I had been throwing any extra money towards that large loan. But my parents keep nagging me to save for retirement. I do have a Roth IRA invested in a Vanguard target retirement date fund, but I had been largely holding out on contributing to that in order to pay down the large interest rate loan.

I earn $43K per year and have $184K in federal student loans at 7.431% interest.  My job is private sector and therefore I don't qualify for PSLF or LRAP.  Unless I make a significant career change, my income will probably barely keep pace with inflation because my current job is dead-end.  At the current rate of things, it looks like I will have $360K of student loans forgiven in 2033.  So basically I need to save $100K to pay the income tax on that, as well as making my monthly payments (currently $215).

I do not get any benefits through work at all.

Anyway, a guy from my hometown, the brother of a guy I went to high school with, is a financial adviser at a company known for pushing whole life policies and he convinced me to take one out recently at $100/month so I can save for this tax bomb and not have to pay additional taxes on the disbursement.  In addition, my dad owns another whole life policy in my name that he has had for around 20 years.  Since my dad pays for the older policy, I suppose that's not really a concern of mine but it is relevant info.  Here are the details of the two policies:

The one I pay:  $100/month.  Issued about two months ago, but I only had the in-person policy delivery this week.  There might be a provision where I can get out of it in the first 30 days after delivery but I will have to check.  Dividends are used to purchase paid-up additional insurance.  The illustration I have shows that in around 18 years the insurance value will be about $125K, while the cash surrender value will be $25K, and the ""paid-up"" (whatever that means) will be $80K.

The one my dad pays:  $35/month.  Issued 1996.  Net insurance amount as of 2033 will be $85000.  Cash surrender value in 2033 of $27500.

Also, I plan to retire at age 67 in 2054 and have nothing saved up for that.

So was it stupid to buy the whole life?  If it isn't too late, should I pull out of it and do something else?  And if so, is there any way to do this without alienating the financial adviser?

* TFSA (I put about $500 a month into this, interest rate is only 1% though, pretty shitty)

* Visa ($500 limit, 20% interest rate, I barely use this card outside of an online purchase) - No outstanding balance

* Student Line of Credit ($5,000 limit, 3% interest rate, and again this account is seldom used) - No outstanding balance

personalfinance,Does it make sense for us to purchase a new house?,"First, some background on us.

My wife and I are in our late thirties and we have two young children (6 yrs old and 3 yrs old).  We have a combined and stable income of approximately $240,000 per year.  We live in a town home in a good neighborhood with a good school district.  Our mortgage payment/month is $2,881; property tax/month is $559; and HOA/month is $400.  Given our tax bracket, I calculated that we save approximately $647/month in income taxes by virtue of our mortgage interest and property tax deductions.  

The value of our home is approximately $600,000.  If we sell it, we can expect to have net proceeds of $91,000.    

We're in the market for a $800,000 house.  For the down payment, we plan to use the $91,000 from the sale of our current house.  Since we only have enough cash for roughly a 10% downpayment, our lender has offered a ""80-10-10"" plan with the following terms:

1st loan (30 year fixed):  $625,000 at 3.99%;
2nd loan (30 year variable rate home equity line of credit):  $95,000 at 5.240%

The second loan's interest rate is tied to the prime rate (currently at 3.25%).  The new rate is calculated monthly by adding 1.99% to the prime.  For the first 10 years, the payments are interest only.  For the remaining 20 years, the payments are for principal and interest.   

So, if we purchase the $800,000 house, these are the numbers I calculated:  Mortgage payment/month would be $3395; property tax would be $833/month; HOA would be $0/month (yay!); and we would save approximately $1072/month in income taxes by virtue of the mortgage interest and property tax deductions.  

If my calculations are correct, we would actually be paying less per month with the new house then what we currently pay.  My biggest concern is with the second variable interest loan.  In 1980, the prime rate reached 21.5%, and the possibility that I could be paying 23.5% on a $95,000 loan would keep me up at night.   

Are my concerns about the second loan misplaced?  Do my numbers sound about right?  Also, any other insight would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1428136525

* Retirement Account: none (will be able to open in June/July 2015)
* Investments: none, and never before
* Debts: federal student loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized), which I will need to start paying by November 2015

My salary will be high enough that I am not concerned about saving as much as I can to make payments on my student loans before.

This year, my tax software has given me the option to use up to $5,000 of my federal tax return to purchase U.S. Series I Savings Bonds. I am considering using the at least part (if not all) of my return. Even though I-Bonds have a 0% fixed rate and a 1.48% composite rate, it's better than my savings account, which earns me a whopping six cents a month. However, if the money *were* just in my bank account, I'd have it immediately available to put a sizeable dent in the principal of my ~4-5% interest rate student loans.

My research is telling me that I should *not* do this since I have no stock investments (although I do have the capital to try my luck with that) and the wiki warns against being 100% invested in bonds. Moreover, I've read that it's not necessarily the best idea to immediately pay off all your low interest debt since the return on a long term investment could exceed the amount saved from not paying interest.

I’m going to briefly talk about SB101 that existed until Thursday evening, just so you can appreciate the subtlety and the way things apparently actually went down. Here goes! I have bolded specific things that I want to stick out to you as we go through things.

Definitions – these are **extremely important**, and I will get to why at the end. 

A **Governmental entity** is defined in this Act as any of the following (Section 6 – sorry to bounce around, but this is the way it makes sense to me)

As used in this chapter, **governmental entity** includes the whole or any part of a branch, department, agency, instrumentality, official, or other individual or entity **acting under the color of the law** of any of the following:

1.	State government
2.	A political subdivision
3.	An instrumentality of a governmental entity described in this subdivision (1) or (2), including a state educational institution
4.	A body politic
5.	A body corporate and politic
6.	Or any other similar entity established by law


Similarly, the term **person** includes (Section 7):
1.	An individual, 
2.	**An organization, religious society, a church, a body of communicants, or a group organized and operated primarily for religious purposes** 

*[this is important – will get to it why in a moment]*

3.	A partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association, or any other entity that may be:
a.	Sued and be sued
b.	Exercises practices that are compelled or limited by a system of religious belief held by an individual or the individuals
Who have control and substantial ownership of the entity, regardless of whether the entity is organized and operated for profit or nonprofit purposes.

Sec 8
(a)	Except as provided by subsection (b), a governmental entity **may not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion**, even if it burden results from a general applicability
(b)	A governmental entity **may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only** if the governmental entity demonstrates that the application of this burden  to the person produces:

(1)	Is in furtherance of a **compelling governmental interest**
(2)	**Is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest**

*[note – I still don’t know what Indiana or DC defines as a compelling governmental interest – maybe someone else does]*

Sec. 9

A person whose **exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened**, by a violation of this chapter **may assert the violation or impeding violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding**, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is party to the proceeding, the government entity has an unconditional right to intervene in order to respond to the person’s invocation of this chapter.

Sec 10
(a)	If a court or other tribunal in which a violation of this chapter is asserted in conformity with Section 9 of this chapter determines that
(1)	The person’s exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be burdened; and,
(2)	The **governmental entity imposing the burden has not demonstrated** that application of the burden to the person:

a.	**Is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest**; and
b.	**Is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest**;

The court or other tribunal **shall allow a defense against any party and shall grant appropriate relief against the governmental entity**

(b)	Relief against the governmental entity may include any of the following:

(1)	Declaratory relief or an injunction or mandate that prevents, restrains, corrects, or abates the violation of this chapter
(2)	Compensatory damages


(c)	In the appropriate case, the court or other tribunal also may award all or part of the costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees, to a person that prevails against the governmental entity under this chapter.

So, what SB101 really did was allow for a religious defense in court for someone who claims their rights of practicing their religion have been **substantially burdened** would have the backing of the State to intervene and investigate, effectively establishing a legal defense of such. 


Now, of course, this **person** would have to prove in court that their religious practices were being burdened, and I think we can agree that not selling a gay man ice cream because he’s gay and because the ice cream man is a God fearin’ Christian would be impossible to prove in court, so all of the media backlash was typical distraction scaremongering (IMHO).


There was a PR campaign (#boycottindiana) and naturally, Indiana “acquiesced” Thursday night and passed a conference committee report (the second link above) as a *delete everything after the enacting clause amendment*, eliminating SB101 in it's entirety and inserting new paragraphs in their place.

So, the new SB101 will read as follows:

Sec. 0.7 This chapter **does not**:
(1)	**Authorize a provider to refuse** to offer or provide services, facilities, use of public accommodations, goods, employment, or housing to any member or members of the general public on the basis of race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or United States military service

(2)	**Establish a defense to a civil action or criminal prosecution for refusal by a provider** to offer or provide services, facilities, use of public accommodations, goods, employment, or housing to any member or members of the general public on the basis of race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or United States military service

(3)	**Negate any rights available under the Constitution of the State of Indiana**

Sounds great right? Exactly what everyone was clamoring for. Except notice that instead of persons and governmental entities and all that (remember – this new legislation deleted **everything after the enacting clause**, they now are using the term *provider*. So, what does *provider* mean? The next section lets us know what they mean:

Section 7.5

As used in this chapter, *provider* means one (1) or more individuals, partnerships, associations, organizations, limited liability companies, corporations, and other organized groups of persons. **The term does not include**:

(1)	**A church or other nonprofit religious organization or society, including an affiliated school, that is exempt from federal income taxation under 26 U.S.C 501(a), as amended (excluding any activity that generates unrelated business taxable income (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 512, as amended**

(2)	**A rabbi, priest, preacher, minister, pastor, or designee of a church or other nonprofit religious organization or society when the individual is engaged in a religious or affiliated education function of the church or other nonprofit religious organization or society**

Do you see what this does? Before SB101, it was broad, and really didn’t say much about any particular discrimination, but kind-of allowed religious institutions (which was covered under that broad **person** definition) a legal defense if they could prove that their religious practices were being **substantially burdened** by something or someone (defined broadly as a **governmental entity**, I suppose).

But now, we have this new great championing bill that strikes down the bigoted legislation (which it really wasn’t, as far as I can tell), and then right in the bill states that all of Section 0.7 **doesn’t apply to religious institutions, because the term *provider* does not include religious institutions (see 7.5 (1) and (2).**

So, does this new law actually state that you a *provider* cannot discriminate against all of that stuff said above (which they couldn’t anyway, due to federal law), but it apparently exempts religious institutions from this type of discrimination. 

…right?

Any insight or discussion is welcome - and I hope you all who made it to the end learned something, and the importance of reading primary source documents once in awhile. It seems in this case that what was reported wasn't really the case - and it seems like the replacement legislation is actually far worse (from a discrimination standpoint), potentially.",cryptocurrency,1428156274

So, what SB101 really did was allow for a religious defense in court for someone who claims their rights of practicing their religion have been **substantially burdened** would have the backing of the State to intervene and investigate, effectively establishing a legal defense of such. 


Now, of course, this **person** would have to prove in court that their religious practices were being burdened, and I think we can agree that not selling a gay man ice cream because he’s gay and because the ice cream man is a God fearin’ Christian would be impossible to prove in court, so all of the media backlash was typical distraction scaremongering (IMHO).


There was a PR campaign (#boycottindiana) and naturally, Indiana “acquiesced” Thursday night and passed a conference committee report (the second link above) as a *delete everything after the enacting clause amendment*, eliminating SB101 in it's entirety and inserting new paragraphs in their place.

So, the new SB101 will read as follows:

Sec. 0.7 This chapter **does not**:
(1)	**Authorize a provider to refuse** to offer or provide services, facilities, use of public accommodations, goods, employment, or housing to any member or members of the general public on the basis of race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or United States military service

(2)	**Establish a defense to a civil action or criminal prosecution for refusal by a provider** to offer or provide services, facilities, use of public accommodations, goods, employment, or housing to any member or members of the general public on the basis of race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or United States military service

(3)	**Negate any rights available under the Constitution of the State of Indiana**

Sounds great right? Exactly what everyone was clamoring for. Except notice that instead of persons and governmental entities and all that (remember – this new legislation deleted **everything after the enacting clause**, they now are using the term *provider*. So, what does *provider* mean? The next section lets us know what they mean:

Section 7.5

As used in this chapter, *provider* means one (1) or more individuals, partnerships, associations, organizations, limited liability companies, corporations, and other organized groups of persons. **The term does not include**:

(1)	**A church or other nonprofit religious organization or society, including an affiliated school, that is exempt from federal income taxation under 26 U.S.C 501(a), as amended (excluding any activity that generates unrelated business taxable income (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 512, as amended**

(2)	**A rabbi, priest, preacher, minister, pastor, or designee of a church or other nonprofit religious organization or society when the individual is engaged in a religious or affiliated education function of the church or other nonprofit religious organization or society**

Do you see what this does? Before SB101, it was broad, and really didn’t say much about any particular discrimination, but kind-of allowed religious institutions (which was covered under that broad **person** definition) a legal defense if they could prove that their religious practices were being **substantially burdened** by something or someone (defined broadly as a **governmental entity**, I suppose).

But now, we have this new great championing bill that strikes down the bigoted legislation (which it really wasn’t, as far as I can tell), and then right in the bill states that all of Section 0.7 **doesn’t apply to religious institutions, because the term *provider* does not include religious institutions (see 7.5 (1) and (2).**

So, does this new law actually state that you a *provider* cannot discriminate against all of that stuff said above (which they couldn’t anyway, due to federal law), but it apparently exempts religious institutions from this type of discrimination. 

…right?

Any insight or discussion is welcome - and I hope you all who made it to the end learned something, and the importance of reading primary source documents once in awhile. It seems in this case that what was reported wasn't really the case - and it seems like the replacement legislation is actually far worse (from a discrimination standpoint), potentially.",cryptocurrency,1428156711
personalfinance,NY State recapture tax for unqualified 529 distribution by non-resident—how much?,"First time poster here, excited to join this informative section of reddit. 

After finishing college and paying off college loans, I recently found out I inherited a 529 education savings account, such that I am now both the owner and beneficiary of the account. It is a significant chunk of change, and I'd like to take this money out as an unqualified distribution (that is, not for education), but first I'd like to check what the tax consequences will be—especially the tax recapture (explained below). I don't know why the original owner did not let me know about this account while I was actually in college....wacky relatives, I guess?
&amp;nbsp;

The account has $30K principle investment and $0 earnings (it lost ~$1000 of the principle!)
&amp;nbsp;

Big question: Since is it a NY state 529 and the original owner was a NY resident, he got state tax deductions on the contributions (but not federal). I am NOT a NY resident and am planning an unqualified distribution, meaning I could be subject to NY state “tax recapture”. Does anyone know how I could figure out how much NY will tax if I take all $30K out in one tax year (or $15K split over two years to make sure I am under the amount needed to declare in NY at all)?
&amp;nbsp;

Extra background info:
As far as I understand it, taxes are as follows for unqualified distributions of 529's:
&amp;nbsp;

Federal taxes won't apply since they only tax earnings ($0), and for the original owner, federal income taxes were paid before being added to the account.
NY state might want some amount for tax recapture, though it is unclear how much; a tax adviser I spoke with thought recapture might only apply to the earnings, the internet says otherwise for ny residents:  http://www.justanswer.com/tax/3mb6o-want-unqualified-distribution-ny-529-plan.html . Will my home state (which taxes income) also want a chunk? If so, will it be on the principle, or just the earnings?


If you are interested, here are the reasons I chose to take it out as an unqualified distribution instead of trying to keep it in the 529 or make a qualified distribution (an education expense)  
1) I will not be going through more school (and if I do, it won't likely qualify since it will be wilderness survival or random classes for fun)  
2) I don't have anyone I could give it to –the beneficiary change rules stipulate only certain types of relatives (brother, sister, father, mother, husband, wife, brother in law, 1st cousins, etc).  
3) I want to invest it in a different way that won't incur a 10% fed tax penalty.  
4) This will be a low income year for me before several (likely) higher income years.  
5) No college loans I could cover, and as far as I understand 529 distributions cannot be used to pay college loans anyway.   
&amp;nbsp;


TL;DR : How much money will NY “recapture” from an unqualified 529 distribution? Will my non-NY home state take taxes out too? How much?

Yay for taxes!

personalfinance,Any advice on what to do with (so for not too significant) savings? (UK),"I finished university about a year ago and I've been in work for about that long. I normally manage to put around £500 into savings each month (although for the next month or two I think I'll put that into savings for a holiday in the summer). 

I don't have much in the way of expenses, I've paid off any overdraft and credit card debt I had from uni, and I have pretty small student loans that I put a bit into each month (yay for state-funded education). Since I finished uni my parents were nice enough to let me stay at home for a bit, so I can save up some money and hopefully won't be stuck in the rent cycle forever.

I've managed to save around £4000 so far, and I just noticed that the interest for the year was put into the account. A grand total of ... £20. 

I know there's not a whole lot you can do with the amount I have, but it will increase as time goes on. Is there anything I should be doing to increase my savings beyond just the monthly amount I put in from my salary? I'm also a complete beginner at this, so while I imagine there are much better interest rates than my crappy 0.5%, is there an easy way to compare and find these? Is an ISA the best way to go? (that's actually what I'm using now) How do I actually go about changing to a new account in a new bank?

personalfinance,Options Paying Tuition,"I just signed up for the upcoming summer semester. Tuition comes out to almost $2700. The university offers a payment plan option, which breaks up the total cost to 3-4 installments. I receive financial aid in grants and loans. I usually accept the grants and deny the loans. The grants along with income from work have allowed me to take advantage of the payment plan option, and so far, I have $0 debt from tuition.

My question is, would there be any benefit to taking out a loan (subsidized or unsubsidized), and then paying it off? I'm not sure what the interest rates look like for the loans. The payment plan has a $30 charge.

personalfinance,160k total in Navient student loans (Both federal and private). I need someone to convince me not to default on my private loans.,"Hello. I'm 29, in a domestic relationship (currently supporting my SO) and renting a small house in an Atlanta suburb.

* - Rent is 795/mo
* - Utilities end up averaging about 250/mo, including internet
* - Other expenses (gas and food) are budgeted at 300/mo
* - My private student loan payments are 365/mo
* - Currently am not paying my federal loans (forbearance/deferment) 

[Here is a list of my private loans](http://i.imgur.com/Ud1KfXP.png)

The loans with the 1% interest rate are under an automatic debit program for 365/mo. The Signature Loans are the loans which my parents cosigned, and are paying currently. The Smart Option loan, with its high interest rate, is of some concern. 

My federal loans include Stafford Loans, shown here:

* [Department of Education](http://i.imgur.com/95sRXqv.png)
* [Subsidized Federal Loans](http://i.imgur.com/mnZ8KQk.png)

The grand total currently is 160,171.70

With an income (hourly not salary) of about 2000/mo, I can sometimes come away with 290 in disposable income. This doesn't account for emergencies and unexpected expenses.

Eventually, I need to start paying my federal loans. With recent changes in forgiveness laws, I know that it's possible to get by just paying my 365/mo private loans for 20 years. If I pay off that smart option loan asap, interest doesn't get any better for me. I say all of this to acknowledge that my situation is *managable*.

Here's the rub: I want to save for retirement, for travel, for anything else. I want something closer to what I naively thought college expenses would grant me. That 365 could be put toward these things, along with some more affordable payments to my federal loans.

In Georgia, the statute of limitations for collections by private lenders is 6 years. I'm starting to wonder if I could manage having bad credit (I've had poor credit for a long time now) for part of my life while saving the money. I know that not paying federal loans would result in wage garnishment, but with private loans, I keep hearing the idea that they'd have a much harder time doing so. This is eroding my desire to continue paying them.

Any experience or advice is welcome. Please be constructive; I don't need to hear that I shouldn't have taken the loans out in the first place. It was ten years ago, and I accept responsibility for my ignorant actions and for allowing myself to be preyed upon by a for-profit college. 

Thank you for taking the time.

EDIT: I appreciate everyone who gave advice, provided a realistic perspective, or just told me some of the hard truth that I have to swallow. Thank you for not personally attacking me for my ignorance. There are no delusions that my thought of defaulting was completely selfish, but if you were in my situation you might understand why it would come to mind.

UPDATE: Thanks for the comments!  Happy to share, but sorry in advance if it's a humble brag :/

I actually began my career in a ""prestigious"" wealth management role - during the go go days of finance, where the sky was the limit and I had a sense of entitlement to match.  Fast forward 3 years to late 2008, when I was finally fed up with the practices I observed and just the questionable tactics (read: greed, corruption, overall horribleness) on Wall Street.  I launched a financial education consultancy for young professionals and low-income people.  However, I still did not understand the value of a dollar; ironic, I know!  I earned $1, I spent $1.10.

I had purchased a condo with almost no money down, literally at the peak of the real estate market in 2006.  If you think it sounds crazy: everyone was doing it, I swear!

So I clearly had my own personal (spending) failings, plus people were holding onto their wallets during the great recession; financial education is delayed gratification, and my prospective clients had more pressing fiscal responsibilities.  Over 1.5 years, my runway ran out and I was eventually living on food stamps, foreclosed on my condo, and had to declare bankruptcy.  Most horrible year of my life, by far.  But I still refused to get a job in finance, the only applicable profession given my resume, and held out a little longer for a new career.  

On Craigslist, I found a job as a commission-only technology recruiter.  It was love at first site.  (I'll actually be blogging on the Recruiting industry publications, going into depth on how I succeeded - in short, I employed different sales tactics and was just blunt, ethical, and honest).  But most of all, and relevant to this sub, is that I set a new financial goal for myself: decided I only needed $X income per year and $Y to retire.  At the time, I had the same retirement goal as most people - technically, it was Age 70 because I was already 5 years behind!

So that's where this Elon story resonated with me.  The fact that I DIDN'T need much money to sustain myself made me so much more effective in my career.  I lacked the desperation so common to salespeople, I truly did not care one I hit my bare minimum sales numbers.  Then momentum kicked in - I would start having these surreal conversations with my girlfriend every month ""This is awkward, but you know I have this income goal?  Well, I hit it again in the first week and don't know what to do with the rest of my time.""  So I suddenly had this excess money to put towards retirement, and the Age slowly moved from 70 to 50 in the first year.  

After year 1 as a recruiter, I launched my own agency and went through the stratosphere.  I had so many areas for improvement - still do! - and every new efficiency led to amazing results.  By my second year as a recruiter, I was netting $250 - $500 an hour.  And it went up and up (I'm curious where it'll max out).

So that's my story.  I know this FI sub is really honed in on their financial goals, and hopefully this offers up something useful!  Thanks for reading, if you're still awake!",finance,1428165143

The car that we are looking to purchase is $33k. We make about $185k, and have about $120k in savings/liquidity. According to credit.com, my credit score is 812.

With our current car, we had taken a loan both to beef up our credit payment/history, and since we got a low interest rate, and have been able to instead put that money into funds that have returned more than the interest has cost us.

So that brings us to the current upcoming purchase. We could get a loan again, which would leave us with more cash for a down payment on a house, but I worry about the amount that the loan could increase the interest rate on a mortgage.

I filed my tax return in February, I try to be on top of things and I had what I thought were all the required documents in order early on, so I filed early. About 2 weeks ago my wife got a call from an employer that she worked for briefly in the spring of 2014, it was a part time job that she had for only a month or two.

The employer calls saying they received her W2 back as undeliverable and they want to know where to send it. Turns out they sent it to an incorrect address. I had completely forgotten she even worked for this employer and like I said, I had already filed.

I used TurboTax to e-file both federal and state and I've already received my refund for both. I'm also using TurboTax to amend the return. Her employer took no federal taxes out, so I owe a small amount, not a problem at all. They took an appropriate amount of state tax out, so I owe nothing to the state and I'm entitled to no additional refund.

This is where I get confused. Do I need to amend my state return if only my federal return was impacted by the additional W2?

personalfinance,Capital gains taxes as a dependent?,"So I'm a full time student and have been investing my own money for 10ish years.

I'm also only 20 years and claimed as a dependent by my parents.

My capital gains this year were +$10,300, and under the state I owe $388. Okay.

I thought those were all of the forms I had to fill out. Turns out, because I made over $10,000 the IRS needs an 8615 form filled out. The 8615 is to protect against parents using their children as shields from capital gains taxes.

After the 8615 I owe $388 in Michigan and $1,310 to the fed.

Is this just a hard lesson learned? Where I should have sold only $9,900 worth of stock and I wouldn't be slammed by the fed? Is there a work around?

If I claim to be an independent I pay way less, and my parent's pay more, but they don't pay $1,310 more, it's around $1,100 more, but I'm under their insurance, and I can't claim to be an independent for some of those other qualifying reasons, correct?

I've never created a hydroponic or aeroponic system before, but I'd like to try growing some cherry tomatoes aeroponically.

I'm a little uncertain about some parts of this design though and I'd appreciate your input.

1. What size should my net pot be? 2"" vs 3""? Does it really matter?

2. What's a good medium to fill the net pot with?

3. Is a single dewey mister enough or do I need something circulating the nutrient solution? I read 2 dewey mister reviews on Amazon that said a dewey mister alone isn't enough and mentioned nutrient solution settling to the bottom if you don't have some kind of circulation or an airstone. Is there any truth to that?

politics,Why I don't think we should have bank deposit insurance,"Interesting paper from an IMF economist ""Far from being a theoretical concern, moral hazard in explicit deposit insurance is significant and quite real. Worldwide, explicit deposit insurance has been shown to increase the likelihood of bank crises significantly. Combining deposit insurance with interest rate liberalization makes moral hazard even worse because it permits banks to chase high-yield investments carrying heightened risk."" https://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2006/mfl/pam.pdf

Is the downside of deposit insurance worth it?

I would say no but I'd like to hear what you have to say.

During the great depression when there was no deposit insurance, 1/5th of people lost money in banks, and of those people, they lost an average of 20% of their deposits http://www.voxeu.org/article/lessons-banking-profits-great-depression.

75% of the population has a savings deposit that's equal to less than 6 months of their salary
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/24/americans-savings_n_3478932.html

If they lost 20% of that, that would be the equivalent of losing a little over months worth of salary. Sure that would suck, but I would say that the benefit of not having deposit insurance is worth that risk. They would actually lose probably much less than 1 months salary because that 6 month figure is total savings including stocks and bonds and stuff, not just deposits.

My idea is that the Fed would grade banks A-F, similar to how the FDIC has a ""problem list"" now. If the bank you had your money in had a good grade, there wouldn't be a run on that bank because people would know that their money is safe, since you would know that the Fed would act as a lender of last resort for that bank during a run. This is the problem with runs during the great depression, the Fed did not act as a lender of last resort for ""good"" banks.

In my scenario, bad banks, which would be rated as ""F"" would not have access to the fed as a lender of last resort, meaning their depositors money is unsecured. The bank would have to offer a financial incentive for depositors to keep their money in the bank while getting out of the ""F"" zone as soon as possible.

This would mitigate the effect of runs, since the Fed would act as a lender of last resort for ""good"" banks so peoples money would be secured, unlike the depression.",finance,1428203102
personalfinance,Buying a home: now or later,"Hi PF,


My wife and I are in our later 20s. We plan to start trying for kids (2) in a few years. We are lucky buggers. Due to some investing by her grandparents/parents, lack of student loan debt, and our own saving we have a healthy chunk of change for a downpayment. We also have a stable rented apt that we live in now. We've done the math and we could afford a modest 3br condo in our favorite neighborhood (25% debt to income ratio). We are thinking about going for it. But there are reasons not to as well. I would appreciate your thoughts on these Pros and Cons.

**Pros:**

* Mortgage Interest rates are low now and will likely rise in the next couple years. 

* Our real estate market has been rising like gangbusters the past 2 years. It's a wealthy city-suburb with a stable real estate market that weathered the recession with only a 3% dip.

* We worry if we wait until kids arrive (2 - 4 yrs) the combination of rising interest rates + rising home prices will price us out of our ""dream"" neighborhood, even with added savings going toward a future downpayment. Would be a shame because we could afford it now.


* Also, we like the idea of buying a home without the stress of having a baby on the way. We worry that added stress might make us settle for a less-than-ideal home.

**Cons:**

* We are happy living where we are now (stable rent apt.) and don't have anything pushing us to leave (except 3 - 5 year plans). We don't WANT to move we just feel like it would be a pragmatically good idea.

* We may not be good at expecting what kind of home we would want as parents. As an example, a friend with kids told me when he was looking for houses he didn't like one because it was on a larger road and he worried about the kids playing in the street. That's a consideration I might have not thought of being childless in my late twenties. Like maybe we will want to move out to the real suburbs even thought right now we want to stay in our hip city-suburb.


* We missed the bottom out in prices by two years and are getting in late. Since the market is stable it's unlikely to be a bubble here but it could very well plateau soon.

Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin is the Future of Finance,"This was my reply to someone asking about Bitcoin adoption in the financial community; I thought r/Bitcoin might find it interesting, so here it is:

""...By adoption I mean this: right now, if you wanna say, send $100 million somewhere, you have to use an RTGS system such as FedWire in the US or TARGET2 in the EU. These systems are designed to be highly secure and redundant, but they don't come close to Bitcoin's payment clearing protocol, in terms of speed, security, and/or redundancy. These systems exist on a country-wide basis, so they can be fucked with by local governments.

But forget illicit uses for now, which Bitcoin is great for - I'm just speaking about legitimate business applications. Bitcoin is universal and decentralized. Unlike, say FedWire, it isn't and can not ever be controlled by any one entity. Being a peer to peer system allows it to remain decentralized, so it currently exists as the world's most perfect money-transfer system. For a financial institution sending huge amount of money from one part of the world to the next, would you trust First your bank, then FedWire, then the country's RTGS, then the recipient's bank, or would you just trust Bitcoin? If Bitcoin were a viable option (which right now it is not,) this would be a no-brainer. We aren't there yet, but I can envision a roadmap as to how we'll get there soon (so can the venture capitalists currently throwing hundreds of millions of dollars into Bitcoin startups and financial services companies.)

Finally, this might be a weird example, but I think it's a good way of illustrating bitcoin's future. Back in the day, if you wanted to download a song, movie, or program, you had to use a oft-forgotten realm the early Internet called Newsgroups. Similar to Reddit for news/text, or Imgur for images, these were essentially massive forums where you could post almost anything you wanted. Users eventually created groups for posting dvdrips, cd-rips, and cracked software, and thus early online pirating was born (back in the day these files were called Warez). Eventually, technology gave rise to a wonderful thing called P2P, which ushered in the days of Napster, Kazaa, Morpheus, eDonkey, Limewire, etc. Filesharing became decentralized, as the ISP's which controlled the newsgroups were now out of the picture, but the files were still stored on single machines. Finally, the BitTorrent protocol was invented, and now the real fun begins, as the files are instead stored in the cloud. When you download a torrent file, you download it from a hundred people at once, maximizing speed, security, reliability.

This is essentially how I view Bitcoin, except instead of Filesharing, we're talking about money. Bitcoin is to the flow of money across the globe as what BitTorrent was to Newsgroups. And what ended up happening to BitTorrent after all these years? Well, it now accounts for 10% of all worldwide Internet traffic downloads, and 35% of all uploads. Hmm...""",cryptocurrency,1428210500

personalfinance,Need advice on whether to save for a down payment on a house or pay off my student loans.,"Hello!  Due to some unforeseen circumstances I've found myself in a position where I now have free housing for the next 3 years.  I'm 23 and I'd like to use this situation to help me get a jump start on my financial goals for the future, but I have a few questions.

1. I currently have $16,000 of student loan debt.  Other than that I'm debt free.  The average interest rate on my loans is 4%, and I still have 2 months of grace period before I have to start paying on them, although I've already paid off around $2,000.  Should I pay my loans off immediately or make the minimum payment and save for  a down payment on a house? My thinking is that if I wait on the loans I end up paying more in interest, however if I wait on the house down payment I may not have enough once the 3 years are up and I would have to live in an apartment for a year, which in my opinion is a huge waste of money because the rent I'm paying isn't helping me build equity.

2. The company I work for has a great 401k program, and will match 8% of my salary provided I put in the minimum of 3%.  The match doesn't increase as I put in more though.  Should I put in the minimum to get the match, or should I just go ahead and put in the maximum?  I believe the max I can put in is 9%.  The alternative to putting the money in my 401k would be paying  off my student loans faster or saving for a down payment on a house.

Edit:  I also thought I should add that I think I can pay my loans off in about 18 months if I forego saving for a house, and I already have what I'd estimate to be about 3 months of living expenses in savings already.

I'm a chef, and I still owe about 20k on a ""private signature"" student loan.  I have been paying on it since 2004.  The interest rate is fair, and when I was working steadily I was over paying to get my monthly payment to a manageable position.  Started at almost 600 a month, currently down to 270 a month.  Still a long way to go.  Unfortunately, I have had a pretty shitty last few years.  Don't get me wrong many many people have had it a lot worse, but this sucks, for real. 

I ended up getting the arthritis of a 70 year old in my hips at the ripe old age of 23. The hip socket had managed to scrape away all cushion and cartilage from 23-30. My profession of choice requires heavy lifting, bending, twisting, turning, standing for 16 hours, etc. I literally cooked my ass off last year, and could no longer put weight on one of my legs. Had to move states (So I could live with my parents for help) and had to deal with the insurance market place for sooooo long (OBAMAAA! =p) I ended up waiting over a year for surgery. I also ended up on medicaid, which makes things a little trickier to navigate apparently. The surgery for those interested, is called a Birmingham Hip Resurfacing. The idea is you let the bone heal for a year, and you can return to an absolutely normal active life again. It is NOT recommended that someone under 50 get a hip replacement as we know them.  This is a relatively new procedure in the US, and I was lucky my home state had one of the best options. The state I live in assessed me (on 3 attempts) as fully functional even though my doctor references each stated the obvious truth with X-ray and MRI to back it up, so I was denied access to any sort of financial assistance to keep my bills at bay. (I offered to turn in at least 3 people who are scamming government assistance in return for some, but was never given a response..) Their argument was that I could learn a new job where I didn't need to move around, and I can understand that.  My argument is that I'm going to be paying on this loan for a good chunk of the rest of my life, then I should probably be using it, which I can understand is stubborn and probably more in the wrong than anything, but none of that mattered because there were days I couldn't get out of bed to use the restroom, let alone get to work, no matter what job it was.

Today I have sizeable credit card debt, my credit score has dropped significantly, and I've used up all of my forbearance/differment options through the loan company over various medical procedures. Over the years of off and on missing chunks of work I was also playing the 0% balance transfer credit card game to avoid some interest.  It is my thought that the student loan is not federally backed, which means I cannot ask for a pardon on it/bankrupt. But what are my options here?  I'm 2 months post operation, I just re-learned how to walk up and down the street like, two days ago.  I'm still a ways out from full time work, and I'm for sure a year away from doing any manual labor type of work.  PLUS my right hip has the same problem, but fortunately has a chance of never getting to this point.  I'm running out of credit card options, and those loan offers I get in the mail have ridiculous interest rates, it'd be better off paying the individual credit card interests.  Should I go ch. 7 and just keep the student loan, but alleviate myself of the credit card anchor?  Cause sometimes (most of the time) I feel like I'm just circling the toilet bowl throwing money in the air.  I don't feel like it can do much more damage than is going to be done in the next year or two anyway.

If you made it through this, thank you for your time.  I have nothing but time these days, and am willing to answer questions you may have regarding the procedure, as it is starting to turn up that a lot of people age 21-40 are having increased hip issues.

I had health insurance and gave them my info during the visit. In June, I received two bills in the mail for this visit: ~$2000 and ~$400. I realized these claims hadn't been processed through insurance, so I called the hospital and gave them my insurance info over the phone.

The next month, I got the same bills again! I called the hospital again. The rep asked me for my insurance info and told me to ignore those bills, that I'll get new bills if I owe anything.

In late-August, I got the bills for the third time. This time, I was quite frustrated. I provided the info over the phone again and asked them for an email address where I can send a copy of my insurance info. There was a typo in the email addressed I entered, so I re-sent my insurance info in October. 

Also, around this time, I left for a long-term trip to Southeast Asia for a few months. I was in areas where internet was limited. I gave my father access to correspond with my insurance company and the hospital.

In December, the hospital finally got in contact with my insurance company, who said they could not process the claims because it was too old! My father tried to correspond with both places for a bit, but they gave a ""tough luck"" attitude and kind of stopped responding. My dad is also very busy. I was worried about what happened with the bills, and my dad suggested that I deal with them when I return home.

I just returned to the states (from being abroad for 6 months with no US cell phone service), and I had three voice mails from a debt collection agency. Now I feel quite scared. 

I am in medical school, and I am scared this will affect my credit score and eligibility for federal loans. I am also applying to the National Health Services Corps, a federal government program that checks credit scores as a part of the selection process, and something like this would be a big no no. I do NOT want to pay $2400, and I feel upset that I might have to since I had insurance and gave them information 3 times within the time limit.

**Update:** I ended up calling the insurance company and hospital twice each to find out exactly where things went wrong and what their relevant policies are. Then I held a conference call with a representative from each, which went smoothly.

- Student loans are paid at a square rate of $500 monthly. This is overpayment on a minimum of $350. $26,248 remains on the balance with four groups at interest rates of 3.4, 4.5, 5.6, and 6.8%. They are paid proportionately by highest interest rate (6.8% recieves $200 monthly, while the others each get $100, and the lowest groups get $50 when the minimum payment is below $50). Group 5.6% is $144 from completion and the remaining difference will be applied to the 6.8% loan (following this pattern until they are all paid up).
- Monthly expenses vary wildly, so I am looking at my bank statement's ""spending"" section to see what goes out per month. In general, I profit on average about $1k a month after all expenses. More details can be provided about my monthly expenses, but I'll need to put my CC statements under a microscope.
- Zero credit card debt (paid in full monthly). Bank gives 1.5% every purchase. 3% on gas paid once annually.
- No retirement account as I plan to leave this company this year

The question would be where can I improve the profit per month to $1500 and eventually $2000 per month in the smartest manner.

- A friend of mine suggests putting the $20k savings into some sort of fund or investment account, at least enough to beat the rate I am losing to inflation in the bank. This is my emergency fund so I would prefer something stable and readily accessible. Where is the best place to put maybe 75% of this?
- The remaining 25% (or a different proportion if you suggest) should try to mitigate what I didn't do for retirement all last year. I am unsure whether or not I should be more aggressive with student loans, or I should contribute more aggressively to a tax-free retirement account.
- I have learned my lesson with the auto lease and the next vehicle I *buy* will be a couple years old station wagon.
- Rent is a priority expense as I am a frequently targeted minority and require a tolerant, progressive neighbourhood.
- I do not plan on marriage and can't have children, so no plans for family expenses.

personalfinance,"Hi RPF. I graduate from grad school 2 years ago. Things have been going well but I got a call from the University's Bursars Office saying they owe me a $8,600 check, which I gave back in 2012.","I'll start off by saying that I have an awesome family who, after I took a ~$85k loan, offered to pay it off for me to avoid the crazy %6.9 interest rate.  My current interest rate is 0% that I'm paying back monthly.  I know -  I'm very, very lucky and appreciative.  

The point of the story is that in 2012, I received the remaining balance after my tuition was paid - this was so I had money to pay rent/bills - in the sum of about $8,600.  At the time I didn't need the money and 'gave it back' to avoid paying unnecessary interest on it.  I went to the bursar's office and filled out a few forms and simply gave the check back.  Well, a few weeks ago I got a call from the university saying that they had a check to issue to me for $8,600 - they claim they tried to mail it to me but had written my address down incorrectly so they were just now getting around to tracking me down.  This is great, right?  I'm not sure.  I am 100% going to give this money to my folks to pay off a big chunk of the amount I owe them, but here's my question:  How do I know how much (if any) interest was accumulated on this money?  If I did pay interest on this money, can I get this back from the loan issuer?  How could the bursar's office not have have taken care of this originally?  

This is by far the most financially irresponsible thing I've ever done.  I'm frugal and typically responsible.

The loan company was Nelnet.  Any idea if they'll still talk to me?  

The check that they issued me does not contain any information that helps with tracking back to the loan.  

I'm going to call Netnet on Monday as I just received the funds, is there anything else I should do?  Has anyone ever heard of anything like this?

personalfinance,"Personal Finance, I need some help budgeting between a bunch of decisions!","Hi PF...I have lurked here for a long time, now I am ready to post. 

I want to try to make this as simple as possible to layout! 

**Quick facts about me:**   

• I am 24 1/2 Years old.  

• I have a BS in IT and Operations. 
 
• I am approaching almost a year at my current job (contractor for first 4 months, then hired on in September).

• I work usually 45-50 hours a week.  

• I live at home with my parents and drive a combined 80 miles to and from work, daily.  

• I drive a 1999 model car that is becoming unreliable and has 155k miles. I feel lucky she is still lasting me though :)    


**Quick facts about my financials:**  
• I make $45k/yr. before taxes, as the only analyst working for our company (last year I got a $5k bonus on top).  

• $22.5k in student loan debt with interest rates ranging from 3.5%-6.8%.  

• $17k in bank account doing nothing (I'll explain this later).  

• $2k in stock market learning to invest (so far I have made a better return than my highest loan of 6.8%).   

• Current monthly spending includes $75 phone bill, $255 student loans (if I pay minimum), gas, probably $150 to go out with my girlfriend
 
• I have no benefits at my job as of now. It is a start up and we have a big contract with a major company. I am the 6th person hired and we now have 14 (I mention this for people to chime in if I should expect any benefits or any good fortune to come my way in the future, for helping to grow the company).  



**My original plan:**  



I have never been the person who has wanted to work under others (haven't we all). Growing up I have always been the entrepreneurial type, from running the behind-the-scenes candy deals in middle school to coming up with idiotic slogans for college t-shirts and selling them (which helped pay off some student debt). Fast forward to the real world, where I am helping someone else achieve their dream, while getting only a little bit of the revenue (no need to feel like a downer here, after all, it is their company &amp; idea).

   

**This is where I am split on what to do with the money I have saved up, as well as what to do going forward. I have run into a bunch of problems**



**I want to start my own business**  



This can only be achieved with a strong mindset and a financial investment right? I have no idea what I want to do yet, but when the time comes, I want the money so I can pursue my dreams.  At my current job, I continue to learn what it takes to start and maintain a business.  



**I need a car**  



The car I drive now is becoming a money pit and will not last me too much longer. I fillup twice a week and the need to replace parts has started to increase. Up until a few weeks ago I had my mindset on buying a new 2015 Ford Fusion. Putting $10k down and having it paid off in 4 years seemed very feasible, after all, I need a reliable car since I drive so far right?  Then it hit me, what a stupid decision. $28k on a new car? Don't be a dumbass, it will depreciate the second I drive it off the lot. That is not an investment, it is a depreciating asset. Now I am stuck on what to do for a car, especially when I want to save up for starting my own business. I would love to take public transport, however, neither the train or bus are options.



**Pay off student loans (the option I don't want to do)**  
I figured these will always be there and sure, in the end they will make money off the interest. However, a few thousand at the end versus getting rid of $10-15k of my current net worth doesn't seem like the best idea.            


This is all off the top of my head, so I am really sorry if it doesn't make the best sense. I have put off posting this in PF for the longest time, but now I believe it makes sense to. I really appreciate anyones help, and I am very open to any suggestions outside of my above (I always try to think outside the box).

Both his parents were excited and told him to do it, but I told him it wouldn't be a good idea to throw away an emergency fund like that especially because he has kidney stones and a really old truck that needs repairs. 

Is there anything I could say that might convince him otherwise? Or is it possible that he won't be able to get a loan?

Update: I told him about closing costs, insurance, property tax and higher interest rates.

Current SREC (Solar Renewable Energy Credit) prices in NJ trade around $185. So electric savings and my 10 SRECs yield about $3,600 a year, which is about a 5-6 year break even. The PPA would immediately save about $600 a year with no investment.

Bitcoin,"why bitcoin will fail, explain me otherwise why not","So here's my explanation why in my Theory bitcoin will fail.

**1. The algorithm get's harder to crack**

They say the algorithm get's harder with each user mining bitcoins. I heard that this is a good thing because the coin will be more stable if there's a difficulty level with each miner involved. 

But to be honest, The system that is used is a bit spouse. 

For example : 5 years ago (more or less), as I can remember, I was mining for like 2 hours with my CPU and GPU and created like 0,001xxxx bitcoins (i know due to the fact it's still there when I opened bitminter last night after so many years)

As i can remember I could have gotten about 2? 3? bitcoins a month back than, and I was actually calculating if it was profitable because the energy bills might be higher.

**Here is why bitcoins in my opinion will fail**

- The algorithm is not a good rewarding system

The algorithm - so let's say for example : 
1 bitcoin = 20 dollars (calculating like back in those days)
My energy bill to run 24 hours 30 days = 58 dollars
And i get 3 bitcoin of 60 dollars each per month.
My net income = 2 dollars 
**all fictional above**

so now let's refer to our 2 dollar profit ""net income"" as 0%

---------------------------------------------

Now example 2 : 
Someone else got better rig.
Bitcoin mining get's harder in difficulty, Person 1 quits bitcoin mining due to a minus in income and profit to pay even the energy bill.

--------------------------------------------

Person 2 mines faster and better. Therefore the bitcoins algorithm will become more and more difficult at a faster rate. 

(conclusion for person 1 from example 1) 
0% (goes to minus) 
energy bill becomes higher than it's net income
conclusion would be Quit mining, or buying better rigs

person from example 2 has let's say a 10% efficiency compared to what Person 1 had when started @ ( 0 % )...

But when person continues at his rate, the algorithm get's more difficult. 
And even with no further more participating miners, his 10% will slowly decay to a 0%

conclusion for this : 
even if person 2 was the last bitcoin miner on earth to participate his 10% will eventually reach 0%, and go to the negative. (and consider stopping, or buying better Rigs) 

Sadly, for this person. He will most probably not be the last one who participates in bitcoin mining, so my example above will be reached faster as person 3, 4, 5 joins and with faster rigs, better equipment etc.


--------------------------------------------

**Why i came to the conclusion, that this is a digital ""new kind of"" ponzi scheme**

For those of you who don't know what a Ponzi scheme is : 
 [reddit!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW5aDmQLqVY)

If you watched the video, or know what a ponzi scheme is, you'll probably noticed or know, that it's not quite there yet. 

But note, that in the end. 

Many will take the fall, unless you get rid of them for Gold / Silver (Or a good rated currency, but to be sure.. Gold / Silver is the way to go) 

Because, the algorithm is bound to fail.

The ponzi scheme can go on, and on.. untill there is no money to split for each new and old comers.
The algorithm is getting harder and harder, untill you will need a nuclear plant as energy source and the quantum cpu google just made with nasa. (sort of?) And still, how far off would you be of my initial 0%. 

what im trying to explain is. The level, of where this algorithm will bring you, (Nasa / Nuclear Quantum, whatever.. you got the point..) it will never be successful for long, it was not build to last. it was build to grab as many bitcoins, when it was easy, and make money out of the guys who actually consider doing Nasa / Nuclear Quantum computing / mining. 

It has never been, profitable.. for just mining. And it will never be, because the algorithm is not with you, it will always be against you. Do understand that some person, will take a big fall. investing in huge rigs, server parks, but will fail to make a profit. and his investment (virtually, although not real or physically, wen't into any number under him in their pockets) 

I consider this not as a ponzi scheme, but it has too many factors and resemblances of it, In Fact, let me 
explain why everyone who participated has actually damaged the global economy with it.  


--------------------------------------------


**Why this is a saver ponzi scheme for the miners, and the most damaging for real, honest existing companies before
the bitcoin**

Before the bitcoin *(or let me refer to crypto currencies)*  there are regular currencies, backed up by gold.
there are companies, like trading companies, real Gold owners, Banking systems, even real estate agencies, restaurants.
Actually picture the whole industry globally who accepts bitcoins and place them in an imaginary list here.

Are you ready? did you got it? You all litterly fucked them up. (not now, but in the end, you all will...)

*I heard some one mine 8 million dollars worth of bitcoins a MONTH!*

So now let's say, he trades/sells these bitcoins into gold, dollars.. buys a house.. 
And sooner or later, bitcoins collapses.. (As i explained when the algorithm get's too hard, it will collapse..)

Now we may all congratulate this guy, on that video, for buying everything he can imagine with nothing but a 
currency ""virtually""... made out of ""figurly of speaking"" thin air. 

As we can already see from the chart. Bitcoin already dropped from 1.100 dollars to 200? 300? 

So lets add some zero's.. 
1.100 (let's make it 1.1 million) 
and he bought a big house / villa / mansion of 1.1 million. 
this 1.1 million in transfer is now somewhere re-traded again most probably. but 
in fact you could tell that his house was actually bought (in today's cash) 
for 200.000 dollars. (as is the currency today, more or less) 

But when the bit coin collapses to 0.. 
He actually bought it ""as i referred above"" with nothing but air.

But the cycle (his 1.1mil in bitcoins) did not stop there. The owner of accepted it, buy's something else, re-trades it, etc.. etc.. so in the end (as the ponzi scheme) someone will take a big fall.. 

to be specific in facts, every bitcoin, that is currently circulating, is in fact thin air. 
And the amount in anything physical, that has been bought with it, will be the amount in real cash for someone to take fall.

for example, there has been traded with bitcoins for so many years. And in total if you would re-calculate this in like.. 50billion dollars.. 

this means, that some people, corpses, companies.. will take eventually a 50 billion fall. 

--------------------------------------------


**the federal reserves, compared to bitcoins**

We all heard about the federal reserves, there are plenty of youtube videos out there. and when you watch it, you think.. how is this possible. How can a company like this exist...? Am i right? 

well, any one who participates in bitcoins.. Is a small federal reserve at home..replace printing money with mining, and you can't deny it. You are doing the same thing...

First the dollar rises, and than it collapses. People spend more than what they have, and in the end, They all file bankruptcy.
You ""Bitcoin miners"" don't need to return it, you wasted only energy... but all the companies you have traded with and who still possesses  them when the bitcoin collapses will take the fall. (your fall, if it was a physical currency like the dollar).

again, another resemblance, only this time not with the ponzi scheme, but with the federal reserves. 

--------------------------------------------

*Be honest with yourself*

take the history of bitcoin. 

Mysteriously entered the world, nobody truly knows who made it... It's against our government, and it's a mony making machine anyone can access at home. 

Sounds too good to be true? Yes, it is.. Only fact is, you aren't taking the fall for it. 
Big corporations do. 


I do believe, anyone with a mind, who can imagine, and build this idea, Did not had as a motive to get rich.. You do not build something like this to get rich, You build this for a bigger purpose, something that has been unseen for many years by everyone. 

Could it be the government itself? 
Please, understand.. that I hate those stupid conspiracy bullshit videos. But in the end, why didn't the government take it down? 
Why didn't they blocked all the sites? Why did they added the currency and made it trade-able ? They could have prevented it long ago if it was ""that much damaging to the government""... Why didn't they boycott it? 

And why did every idiot thought he was participating in something good, cool and had the feeling like you have won from the government. 

You do realize that us compared to the goverment is like comparing us as 5 year olds playing soccer with Ronaldo...",cryptocurrency,1428280735

* Hobbies, fun, eating out, social activities. We make enough that we don’t really have to choose.

* Zero chance of kids. Biologically infeasible. We’re just going to enjoy our lives.


**Financial tools, saving methods**

*401k*: He gets a 50% match up to 6%. Putting 10% into the 401k because our income bracket prevents Roth IRAs, normal IRAs. The 10% is split funny – I do 5% traditional and 5% Roth 401k. As far as I can tell, we’re far beyond any additional tax shelters given our income so we can’t invest in an independent IRA.

She gets 50% match up to 3%. She’s only putting the minimum 3% into her 401k as 100% Roth. Her expenses are higher than his, so we’re over-funding the better account. 

*ESPP*: he contributes the max (15%) to ESPP which buys stock at 90% of the closing fair market value. This is immediately vested. This means he can get a 10% return on 15% of his money immediately.

Question: I’m currently selling *all* of my ESPP shares as soon as they’re vested. A large portion of my bonus is in company stock so I see no reason to hold even more company stock than necessary. I could try to hold the stock for one year to reduce some taxes but I agree with [this guy]( http://financialgeekery.com/2012/05/29/the-ins-and-outs-of-espps-part-3-so-now-what/) and it’s not worth the risk.

I’m currently dumping the ESPP immediately into shared checking and spending them on things like vacations. I’m going to start saving the ESPP in a savings account or a Vanguard mutual fund that isn’t in any tax umbrella. 


**Saving for a condo**

We’re currently renting in Seattle. The home prices here are increasing like crazy and we would like to get the benefits of owning a home including remodeling, choosing our own appliances and just the permanence of our own place. We’ve had to move often due to various factors outside our control and it’s getting frustrating. There is also a part of me that loves the flexibility of renting and doesn’t need to own a place permanently. The traffic here is terrible and we’ve moved a few times based on where our job location currently resided. Buying isn’t such a sure thing. There’s no timeline. There are no kids on the way so we get to be super flexible. I’m struggling with two options

*Option 1*: put it all in savings. Pros: no risk. Cons: no growth, and silly if we don’t end up buying.

*Option 2*: put it all in low-cost Vanguard mutual funds and watch it grow. Pros: potentially more money! Cons: if the stock market and housing market crashes a-la 2008, we won’t be able to jump on some sweet sweet foreclosures. We’re not reliant on this saved money and could absorb the risk of having it lose value but we’re banking on the housing market either going down or slowing since the recent increases don’t seem sustainable.

I’m leaning towards option 1, or maybe a blend of both.

**Reducing tax**

Our tax situation is easy. We basically pay the maximum amount. Without kids, mortgage, massive donations or middle class tax shelters, there’s nothing we can do to reduce our tax burden. Washington state has no income tax, so our burden is solely on the federal level. Because there’s no state tax, I’m banking the majority of our 401ks in a Roth 401k rather than a traditional 401k. I’m making a bet that taxes will be higher during retirement than they currently are. Am I way off base? 

**Tl;dr**: mo money, slightly mo problems.",finance,1428283294
personalfinance,Taxes: Exemptions/Allowences,"My husband and I are filing taxes together, and Turbotax is saying we owe ~1,600. I'm trying to figure out why we owe so much, and think I might have messed up on my exemptions/allowances. I'm hoping someone can shed some light, because neither of us are tax-smart. 

We got married in 2013, and I changed jobs in August 2014. I filed as single at my previous job, but never bothered to update my status to married. My exemptions/allowances were 3 for Federal and 0 for State. I filed as married at my current job with my exemptions/allowances at 1 for Federal and 1 for State. I have NO idea why I'd marked my Federal a 3 for my previous job, and wonder if our taxes are high because of that, and because I'd neglected to change my status?

My husband and I also each got raises, so I think we might be in a different tax bracket (90k combined last year vs 110k this year). If we had made 4 or 5k less, we'd get $500 back instead of owing so much. We have no kids, no car, don't do freelance, pay mortgage on a condo, and don't have outside investments apart from my Roth IRA account.

Anyway, I don't think there's anything we can do now to lower things (believe me, I've tried to claim everything I could), but I just wanted help understanding why our taxes are so high this year and what I can do to prevent it for next year.",finance,1428284104
personalfinance,"I have an opportunity to buy the house I'm currently renting, with the help of a friend. Looking for some advice from someone who's been there.","My friend and I are thinking about buying the place I live in, as the landlord is looking to sell (she's had the place since 1996, kept it incase her kids wanted to go school locally, they don't, so she doesn't really care anymore).  It's a two family, and the girls upstairs just extended.  

The plan is that I'll owner occupy to take advantage of a first time homebuyer loan, and then him and I will split the rental income.  I'll keep some roommates, basically rent to myself and end up taking half back.  We haven't really worked out the details but we would split the down payment and closing costs, pay the PITI out of the rent and then 'split' the remainder (but actually just keep it in an account in case things go wrong).

For the pro column: 1. I work for a bank, my interest rate/closing costs/ everything concerning the loan will be cheap. 2.  We would be able to do the transaction without realtors (seller is an attorney). 3. I know the ins and outs, nooks and cranys of the house. 4. My buddy works construction and knows people who can help us fix shit for cheap.  5 Rental demand is strong (colleges and two law schools nearby), and the neighborhood is stable and pretty nice.  

The Cons:  1. I make about 35K, my friend makes twice that.  He's more interested in the income and not in absorbing potential loss. 2. I can't afford this on my own, but it would almost self sustain with one floor rented.  3. I've never done this before, neither owning nor being a landlord.  

Tell me what you think, and feel free to link me anywhere with good insight/information.  I think this could either be a key to stable, passive income, or a complete nightmare that ruins a friendship.",finance,1428286372
Forex,Coins projection - April 6 - April 10,"The US dollar had a strong fall against major world currencies on Friday after an unexpected weak employment report in the US have seen investors reduce expectations of a rise in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in the second half of this year.

The US Labor Department reported that the US economy added 126,000 jobs in March stations, less than half the gain of February and the smallest increase since December 2013. Economists had
projected an increase of 245,000 jobs in last month.


The February numbers were revised to a decline of 264,000, 295,000 previously reported. The unemployment rate remained stable at 5.5%, down six and a half, staying in line with expectations.
The surprisingly weak report added to concerns about the prospects for economic growth, after other recent economic data have pointed to a slowdown in the beginning of the year.

A labor market slowdown can do Fed officials reconsider an increase already planned for interest rates. Last month, the Fed indicated that the first increase in rates may occur until June, but added that continuous improvement in labor markets would be a key factor to be considered by the bank.
EUR / USD hit 1.0970 on Friday, higher than a week, ranking high of 0.83% on the day.
USD / JPY fell to 118.95 at the end of trading, down 0.63% on the day, while USD / CHF hit 0.9515, a five-week low.

The dollar index, which measures the strength of the US dollar against six major currencies basket, fell 0.95% to 96.84.

The fall in the dollar was exacerbated by light conditions negotiations because the end of Easter week. Most markets in Europe remained closed and the US markets did not work full time.

This week, the US markets will be closed on Monday. The US was to release data on Monday carefully observed on the activity in the service sector and on Wednesday the Fed should publish its minutes of the March meeting.

The policy meetings of central banks of Australia and Japan will also be focus.
In anticipation of next week, the Investing.com compiled a list of these and other significant events that may affect the markets.

personalfinance,Working Grad Student Trying to Make the Right Decisions on Student Loan Deferred Payments and Retirement Savings,"Preface: I'm completely naive about finances.  My parents weren't the best role models in this area, so I've sort of bumbled my way to my current state of financial affairs (be gentle).

I'm 30 and work for the federal government as a civilian research scientist.  My current salary is $78k (bi-weekly take-home is $1900), and on the rise each year (probably about $6k raise early next calendar year).  I am currently working on my PhD (paid for by government) and have about 1.5 to 2 years left before I'm done so my undergrad student loans will be in deferment for a while.  My loan breakdown is as follows:

Unsub @1.73% ~$8k
Sub @1.73% ~$3k
Sub @6.8% ~$12k
Private @2.02% ~$26k

Car Loan: 4yr @1.75% ~$18k ($400/mo)

I have ~$8k in an ""oh shit"" savings account and ~$30k in retirement through the TSP program.  I am contributing 5% to my TSP so I receive all the possible matching (for a total of 10% contribution).

With regard to the student loans: I have paid off all the interest on my federal loans through prepayments on my student loans so all future payments will go to principle + new interest.  I believe the interest on my private student loan is already being capitalized so payments are applied to both principle and interest in some mysterious way.

My plan now is to continue to make prepayments on my student loans toward the 6.8% loans while also making small payments on the unsub and private loans to prevent further growth.  Once the 6.8% loans are gone, I will increase my TSP contributions and make the minimum payments on all loans.  Is this the right thing to do?  The only thing causing me to hesitate about this plan is the fact that the 6.8% loans aren't accruing interest now.

The second thing I'm confused about is how I should be applying my TSP contributions.  Currently I have all of my money going to the L2050 fund which diversifies among all the different funds.  All of this money is in a traditional account.  I started reading more about the Roth option, and it seems to me that I should be putting all my money in Roth because I only pay tax on my contributions and not earnings.  Is there more to it than that?  I understand that more will be taken out of my paycheck and that my income will look higher for income tax purposes, but my guess is this won't be a dramatic change compared to the money saved in untaxed earnings.  This could, however, effect how much I can contribute to my student loan prepayments so maybe I should wait until after my 6.8% loans are gone before making this move?  More info on TSP can be found at www.tsp.gov, but I'm thoroughly confused looking at all the information.

Thank you for any help, hopefully I've provided all the necessary information about my current status.",finance,1428291212
personalfinance,Trying to understand what I can afford when buying a house (CANADA),"Hello,

So, I'll break down what I currently have

* $16,500 in RRSP (which I plan to use with the first time home buyers act)
* $11,500 in my Savings Account

My Partner has:

* $9600 in RRSP (plan to use with the first time home buyers act)
* $12,000 in Savings Account

I've checked our credit scores, and both are ~ 800. I've spoken with the bank and they could get us a interest rate of 2.79% for 5 years, or 2.39% variable. The Gross property tax would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $3,500. 

The only debt between the 2 of us is a $600 car payment each month for 1 more year.

We don't plan on buying today, we are determined to wait until we have $60K (likely by this August).

Together after taxes we bring home 6K (assuming 4 pay cheques for that month). 

My question is, what could we afford and still feel comfortable (without factoring in land transfer/lawyer/survey fees)? I have no desire to live pay cheque to pay cheque. I've been told that we could carry a 320K mortage, however, when I do the numbers I feel safer at 275K. Am I thinking this is going to be harder then it is, or am I right to think 275K is closer to our number?.

Can anything be done?,"I'm 23, had a credit score of about 780+ until recently when I checked and found out it had dropped by about 50 points for having a high utilization percentage on one of my credit cards.

The card is usually paid off and if not, I only carry about $90-130 on it at the most.

It's just infuriating that it would drop so much for such a stupid detail. I have other cards that I could be using, but this one has the lowest interest rate and I was close to getting to the next points tier for a statement credit/cashback.

personalfinance,[Northeast US] Need a small loan for a home improvement project. What are my options?,"My husband and I are getting estimates for a renovation project - turning two bedrooms into one master suite with an en suite bathroom. It should come to about $35k and to help financially, we want to take out a small loan of no more than $10k. We're also completely able to pay back this loan within a year, easily... probably even sooner.

Neither of us are too knowledgeable in financing, so I'm curious of our options. Here are my thoughts so far, but I may be completely wrong or naive about some of them, so I welcome any and all feedback and information on what our options are.

1. My father (former corporate CFO who does some accounting and tax help now that he's retired, and is my only resource for financial knowledge) suggested that I borrow against my 401k, which I'd never heard of before. He said, ""Each repayment is put back into your account, including the interest you pay. It's a great deal!!!"" I contacted our benefits department at my office and they told me, ""We do have a policy that allows employees to take up to 2 loans for a maximum of 50% of their investment. The interest rates and pay back terms will depend on the type of loan,"" and I'm now awaiting a phone call from the financial group that handles our 401k. Is this a wise choice?

1. I looked into personal loans at some local banks and the interest rates are shy of 10%, which I feel is really really high.

1. I looked into home equity loans but I'm very confused about this. The interest rates are so much lower than a personal loan (~2.75%) but when I used their ""loan calculator"" I got an error message saying that they couldn't find a Home Equity Loan that would work for us. I have no idea what that means.

What options do we have? What am I misunderstanding about the things listed above?

Basis swap is an arrangement where two parties exchange variable interest rates from two different money market benchmark, like one might pay Libor where other might choose Treasury bill +spread.

This given example is cross currency basis swap. Where one payment leg is Euro another is USD. Banks are the major participants in this arrangement.
Negative EUR USD basis swap means Euro zone banks are paying premium to access dollar funding. Extreme values might suggest stresses and funding crisis.

This swap traded close to -70 basis points during 2008/09 as financial crisis of that time gave rise to liquidity crunch and banks run for liquidity have dollar pushed the basis spread to that level.
 
During 2011/12, at peak of the Euro zone crisis, US money market funds withdrew their exposure to the region that gave rise to massive dollar funding lack, pushing the spread lower to around -80 basis points.
Since 2014, basis spread after reaching to zero, once again started dropping, now close to -30 basis points. Question is why? Is it an indication to renewed funding stress?

Stress may not be the reason this time. US regulators penalties over banks has given to some dollar funding need, however that doesn't seem large enough to push the spread to the extent.
Euro zone banks and investment house is reaching out to better yielding dollar assets is the major reason for this latest push.
Dollar will remain well bid, especially against Euro, Yen as yield spread is  still significant. However, without improving yield that has fallen over weaker NFP and dovish FED Dollar will lack the driving force.

But I think most asset prices have been pushed by central banks to very elevated levels.""","&gt;Q. So we’re nearing a bubble?

&gt;A. Go back to central banks. Central banks look at growth, at employment, at wages. They are too low. They don’t have the instruments they need, but they feel obliged to do something. So they artificially lift asset prices by maintaining zero interest rates and by using their balance sheet to buy assets.

&gt;Why? Because they hope that they will trigger what’s called the wealth effect. That you will open your 401k, see it has gone up in price, and you’ll spend. And that companies will see their shares are going up and they will be more willing to invest. But there is a massive gap right now between asset prices and fundamentals.

personalfinance,Need to know if I am thinking correctly about a mortgage refinance option,"I think I know the answer to this but I want to get some feedback from others. I just bought a house in Aug 2014 with an FHA loan. The FHA just recently lowered its mortgage insurance premiums which means I could get a lower monthly payment.
Here are the details:
Current loan balance 194,500
Current monthly payment 1,370

New loan 200,500
New payment 1,322

Because of rolling the costs into the new loan the principal balance goes up $6k with only a savings of $48 a month. Essentially I would be losing $6k in equity in exchange for $48/mo. Please tell me I am correct and thinking this is not worth it.

Long version. Holy cow PF, my spouse and I have come a long way since getting married but we aren't done. Here goes. Wife has BS/MBA in teaching. NY job market is awful. We have a child so she isn't working at the moment however she is doing a daycare bit making $700/mo and is going to get more kids in a few months.

personalfinance,Help evaluating home purchase financing options,"I am considering purchasing a home in the $500k range, which is just slightly above median for my area. I have been presented with two different loan scenarios and I was hoping someone could help me evaluate the options. 

The first is a 30 year FHA loan with an interest rate of 3.75% and an APR of 4.44%. I would roll the upfront mortgage insurance of $8443 into the loan. Closing costs, exclusive of the 3.5% down payment, would run about $7500. Total monthly payment is estimated at $3,145 when you include taxes, mortgage insurance, and other fees. 

The second scenario involves multiple mortgages with 5% down. The 1st would be a 30 year mortgage for $400k, with an interest rate of 3.71%, the 2nd would be a 20 year mortgage for $50k at 3.99% and the  3rd would be a 10 year mortgage for $25k at 6.74%! Closing costs exclusive of the down payment would again be $7500.  Total monthly payment for everything is estimated at $3,043.

Is the second scenario better? It avoids PMI, which I understand is not deductible. It also leaves me with a full 5% equity since I would not be rolling in the upfront mortgage insurance payment. 

However, I'm not too thrilled with the 6.74% interest rate on the 3rd mortgage. Would it be better to borrow against my 401(k) at an interest rate of 4.75% to boost my down payment to 10%? I cannot otherwise come up with a 10% down payment without depleting savings below an amount I would feel comfortable with. 

Finally, is there a better 3rd option out there that I am missing (besides continuing to rent/save)? Should I shop for better rates/plans? My credit is above 740 if that matters. Thank you for your help!",finance,1428339244

personalfinance,Student loans transferred to new servicer. Lost interest rate reduction over erroneous late payment history. What next?,"Perhaps I am blowing this out of proportion but I want to make sure I ask the Personal Finance Brain Trust if there is anything else I can do.

My student loan payments go the 1st of the month every month through auto-debit and I have never been late on any account... ever. I graduated in 2009. A recent credit report pull showed a score of 823 (meaningless, I know). I have no private student loans. Anyway, onto the story...

Old Servicer handled all of my federal student loans until mid-March 2015 when three of my oldest students were transferred to New Servicer. I was receiving an interest rate benefit for auto-debit on all of my loans at Old Servicer. 

Upon transfer, the New Servicer disqualified those interest rate benefits due to a ""LATE PAYMENT RECEIVED"" on the same date the loan was transferred. This was not possible since I have never had a late payment to the Old Servicer and no payment was due to New Servicer yet.  

The New Servicer claims that they received a payment history from Old Servicer that showed I was 15 days late to make a payment 9 years ago in 2006. I was still in school at that point and had additional federal student loans disbursed after that date for subsequent semesters. The New Servicer states that since this was outside the 3 day grace period that I am disqualified from the interest rate reduction benefit of auto-pay in 2015.  

My concerns are as follows:  

* My loans were not in repayment in 2006. I am not sure how I can make a late payment on a loan at that time.  
* The New Servicer's website states the late payment date is March 2015. They state they cannot backdate it to 2006 so it is listed as March 2015 on the website. They state my credit history will be unaffected but refuse to put this information in writing.

What I have done so far:  

* I asked Old Servicer to pull payment history on the transferred loans. It will take 3-5 days to send it over. I am waiting for this information.  
* I asked Old Servicer to pull all correspondence from around the 2006 date. They refused as they claim they do not have access to it. I cannot find any correspondence in my possession to support the payment history narrative from New Servicer.  
* I asked my university to send an enrollment verification document but they will provide a graduation verification document. Do I need something else?  
* I asked my bank to provide statements from around that date. However, they state they only keep records from 7 years prior so this will not work either.
* I have searched my email and do not see any electronic correspondence besides updates on loan disbursements. Repayment information/statements came after graduation in 2009.  
* I reviewed historical credit reports over the past 9 years and do not see any late/delinquent accounts from that time period.  
* I have filed a complaint with the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group of the U.S. Department of Education. I probably should have waited but I let my frustration get to me.  

At this point, New Servicer is pointing fingers at Old Servicer on payment history. Old Servicer claims not to have records of correspondence so even if there was an error in payment history that was corrected, I am not sure how we will be able to find it without context. My records do not support the narrative from New Servicer. This is turning into a he-said/she-said issue. This usually does not turn out well for consumer (usually).  

Secondly, New Servicer claims they will not report the (erroneous) records of a late payment from 2006 to the credit agencies since the loan was not being serviced with them at that point. However, their website claims it took place on the day of transfer in 2015. Their claim that this is how their website works provides me no reassurance. My fear is this mistake will make it to my credit report. The fact they will not put any of this in writing causes me a lot of concern. Old Servicer never reported any late payment from 2006 because it does not exist.  

What else can I do or should I do?",finance,1428344163

A tax lien sale is a (often) yearly auction by the county to recover money from delinquent property tax payers. Basically, you pay the county for the right to collect the taxes from the delinquent.

Why is this a potentially good investment?

* Law allows you to collect a penalty interest somewhere around 9%.
* Your lien is senior to all others, secured by property that is worth far more than your investment.
* Rarely, you can capture the upside of foreclosing on the property. This is how the guy made the $60k profit. My county reports only 2% of tax lien sales end up in foreclosure.

technology,"I recently contacted my state Rep David Jolly about Net Neutrality, here is the email to him and his response..","This is what I email (I sent this for my SO for a college assignment)

Dear Representative David Jolly,

I am sending this email to urge you to please allow the newly passed Net Neutrality guidelines to be passed by the US House of Representatives. This agreement is a large step in our country to allow for fair access to the internet. Per a Huffing Post online article, the US is ranked #9 in the world in average broadband speeds, while paying a large premium for these services. Allowing internet providers to charge for higher demand websites should NOT be allowed by the US government. All people who access the internet should be able to do it freely and not have a Telco providers be able to restrict which websites are accessed and placed in internet ""fast lanes"".

Also, pricing has become a huge issue with current internet providers in the US today, per HuffingtonPost.com, Verizon offers FioS service at 500Mbit download speed for 310 dollars/ month, while in Hong Kong, and the price for the SAME speed is only 25 dollars/month. In addition to Hong Kong, in Seoul (The capital of South Korea) they pay $30/month for that same 500Mbit download speed. The question I propose to you, Mr. Representative, is why in the US, it is seemingly ok for companies to price gouge its customers for access to the World Wide Web?

Per the FreePress.net, ""On Feb. 26, the FCC voted to define broadband as what we all know it is — a connection to the outside world that is merely faster than the phone lines we used to use for dial-up access, phone calls and faxes."" Please allow this to take effect, as it will have a profound effect on the future way that Americans access the internet. If this is the ""land of the free"", why should citizens be forced to pay more to visit higher traffic websites?

Also, per the PBS, the American Government was duped into providing up to 200 BILLION (yes, with a B!) in money to the telecommunications companies to gain higher profits while NOT upgrading the current infrastructure. Per PBS' article, ""Over the decade from 1994-2004 the major telephone companies profited from higher phone rates paid by all of us, accelerated depreciation on their networks, and direct tax credits an average of $2,000 per subscriber for which the companies delivered precisely nothing in terms of service to customers. That's $200 billion with nothing to be shown for it."" [By Robert X. Cringely]. This is basically a slap in the face to the Government as well as the citizens, and should not be allowed.

Again, please allow this act to be passed into a bill, so the US may improve its world standing in the broadband internet segment, which will do nothing but help the future of this great country. In the end, Mr. Jolly, I would like feedback on your view to Net Neutrality, as well as your decision as to if you support the new regulations under Title II or not.

#And this is the response from him:

April 6, 2015

Dear Ms. Durig,

Knowing of your interest in the current debate on net neutrality, I wanted to update you on recent actions taken by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which allow the agency to regulate the internet as a Title II telecommunication service, commonly referred to as a ""common carrier.""

On February 26, the FCC voted 3-2 to regulate the internet as a telecommunications utility using a law from 1934. As a Title II common carrier, the internet will be regulated under the Communications Act of 1934, which brings with it onerous regulations that are 81 years old. I strongly disagree with this decision, as it will hamper the innovation of the internet by regulating it as a utility.

The FCC arrived at this decision after prior attempts to regulate the internet failed beneath judicial scrutiny. Both in 2010 and 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down similar regulations, which used clauses under the Title I provisions. Having failed to enforce net neutrality rules under a less regulated Title I information service, the FCC moved to utilize the more restrictive regulatory framework of Title II to accomplish the same objective. Similar to the previous two rulings, this decision is also expected to be mired in judicial proceedings.

Americans have become accustomed to the wealth of information and entertainment that the internet provides them, and rightfully voice their concerns when this status quo becomes threatened. The FCC's most recent ruling establishes regulations that were never meant to be placed upon a service like the internet, using a framework from a time when such a service was inconceivable. We can do better. Congress must insert itself into this debate and create a modern legal structure that preserves the internet as it is and allows for continued innovation in this important sector of our economy.

The creation of the internet sparked a transformative technological revolution- one which our society only gets to witness every hundred years. While we are still in the early stages of developing the internet and utilizing its promise, I am strongly concerned that the FCC's ruling to regulate it as a utility will encumber and stifle further innovative efforts. Such a restriction will restrict the ability to further transform our economy and hamper the efforts to provide access to information for every American. As such, I support the consumer protections offered by the concept of net neutrality, but I only support a net neutrality framework that has been authorized by Congress, not through including the internet in an eight decades old statute which limits its infinite potential by regulating it as a utility.

I am committed to working with my colleagues to evaluate the balanced interests of all sides of this issue and develop a legislative solution that is appropriately tailored to the 21st Century. I have taken the liberty of sharing your thoughts with my colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over legislation dealing with net neutrality. I will be sure to continue to update you on any legislative updates.

Thank you again for taking the time to contact me. It is my hope that you will continue to keep me apprised of your interest in legislative issues important to you. Lastly, please visit my website located at jolly.house.gov and consider signing up for my weekly e-newsletter, which provides updates on issues in Congress.

My wife thinks we should aggressively pay off the credit card and just send $20 - $50 each month toward the medical bills, since they are at zero interest. Basically just send them enough that they don't report us to collections. 

In the past I have practiced Dave Ramsey’s strategy of paying off your smallest accounts first, then applying the money you paid on those toward knocking out the bigger accounts more rapidly. The medical bills are a collection of bills from different sources, for physician services, ambulance rides, surgery, facility fee, etc. Some of them are $350 or $450, while a few are in the $1,000 range. 

We have some savings but not enough to pay off everything at once. We could probably put $2,000 directly on the bills, but that would leave us with very little cash in savings. We’re currently doing $50 each month toward each medical bill, and about $200 each month on the credit card. 

Which would you pay off first?",finance,1428351094
personalfinance,Are private student loans that bad?,"Hello, I'm a student that is transferring to a state school this fall. Unfortunately, I have exhausted my federal/state aid, so I will have to take out a private loan. I'm planning to take out $13,000 a year for two years while I'm in school. The bank that I'll be lending from is Wells Fargo. After looking at the site, I saw that the highest fixed rate is ~11%. If I'm doing my math correctly, I would owe the bank $28860. This doesn't sound bad, coupled with the fact that I'll have to start paying the loan 6 months after graduation plus having a 15 year repayment period with no penalty if i pay early (I'd have to pay $160.33 every month for 15 years). What I don't understand is why others tell me that if I were to take out a private loan, there's a chance that I'll be paying 2 or 3x more than the principal amount. Is there some truth to that? Am I compounding the interest wrong? Thank You.",finance,1428352074
personalfinance,"Is it better to buy a house now with low interest rates and higher prices, or wait for interest rates to rise and drop housing prices?","My coworker and I were debating the housing market in Houston. It's fairly hot, so it seems like the longer you wait, the higher the prices go. The interest rates are so low right now that it seems to be an added motivator to buy right now.

I am almost 25 year old and make about $70k I have almost $14k in loans (down from $36K - 30k student and 6k in car loan) but my credit score is 620.

The reason my credit score is bad because when I was college I was in dire financial condition and let a couple of bill go into collection. It seems so petty looking back it now, it was $150 emergency room charge, $200 for my cell phone bill and $41 on my credit card. 

I have never been late on my student or car loans and in fact would have them paid off several years early. I would like to buy a house in a couple of years (2) but with that bad of a credit score I would think it would be hard getting a mortgage at a decent interest rate if at all.

investing,Tactics for First-Time Buyers,"It was less than a year ago that Mrs Scot and I first jumped on the property ladder. While many finance bloggers preach that renting a house is far superior to buying  – After 11 months of home-ownership I can honestly say that it was the best decision ever! While technically speaking, we don’t fully own the house (the bank does for the next couple of decades) – it is an amazing feeling being able to paint, drill holes and carry-out renovations without seeking permission. Better still, there is no landlord or agency that can turn up for an inspection with 24 hours notice!
If you’re looking at buying a home and want to get your foot on the first rung of the property ladder, you’ve probably already begun viewing properties, investigating mortgage interest rates and maybe even thought about making an offer. At this point, it is important to ensure that you have considered three key things before even looking to buy: Long-Term Plan, Affordability and Exit Plan. Assuming that you have, here are three tips to help you with the next step of the process:
 
Finding a Property
Simply browsing estate agents’ windows may not find you that dream home; you have to put the effort in. This may involve widening your search and investigating your options online. Consider property comparison sites - and use many of them. Just because the ‘big’ ones don’t list a house, it doesn’t mean that it is not worth considering. While it is advantageous to have your house listed in the main directories when selling, not everyone knows about them – and not all estate agents use the comparison sites. Search the online databases of local estate agents and don’t forget about local newspapers. Consider auctions and foreclosures – more often than not, the hidden gems are the ones that you have to do a bit of looking to find!
Don’t just limit yourself to one specific area either. You may have your ideal location, but it may be worthwhile also considering alternative options at this stage. Work out a ‘zone’ where you would be prepared to commute to work from – investigate public transport links, local schools, shops, services etc. Don’t make the mistake that we did and buy a house that is one street away from a fiber-optic broadband connection!
 Tactics for First-Time Buyers
Putting in an Offer
Once you’ve found a property that’s suitable for your needs, the next step is to put in an offer. Obviously you’ll be aware of the asking price, but always try and leave some room for negotiation when putting forward an initial offer – this will leave you with the possibility of reaching some middle ground with the vendor. Most people don’t know what is the ‘expected’ discount on an offer – the truth of the matter is that there is no standard and you can negotiate until your heart’s content! We put in an offer £10,000 under the asking price (which had already been dropped £7,500). We reached middle ground and saved an additional £4000; with a bunch of appliances and furniture included – (fridge, dishwasher, bookcases, sideboard cupboards).
This is the stage when you can start to think a little tactically. Always be mindful of the circumstances of the seller as this can often create some room for manoeuvre on the price. Often sellers may need to make a quick sale and as a first-time buyer this places you in an extremely advantageous position. As you’re not involved in a chain the sale can go through quickly. Remember this and use it to your advantage when making an offer. A lower price on a quick sale may well be more attractive to the vendor.
It’s also worth bearing in mind that if you are buying property in Scotland, there is a slightly different process to follow when putting in an offer.
Another point to bear in mind is that you will often have to prove your ability to qualify for a mortgage. Pre-approvals can be obtained with a given validity and are an excellent thing to have in advance of making an offer. It will also make you a more favorable party if there are multiple offers on the table.
 
See it through
This may not be a specific tactic, but it’s still worthwhile advice. Once your offer is accepted, it really pays to be conscientious and see everything through. It’s imperative that you complete everything on time because even though your offer has been accepted you can still be ‘gazumped’. You can’t necessarily stop this happening, but by ensuring you keep up to date with your side of things, you can place yourself in the best position to avoid this. Furthermore, at this stage you have likely already occurred legal fees – being sloppy and not acting quickly can cost you a bit of cash!

personalfinance,California HERO program - thoughts?,"I recently purchased an older home in San Diego and was wondering what PF thinks about the Hero program.

https://www.heroprogram.com/

Here's a list of products that can be installed.

https://www.heroprogram.com/Products

There are a number of items on that list I'm interested in.  I'd like to go solar. Before that, I'd want a new roof.  I'd like to have A/C installed (don't have it currently).  My furnace is original equipment and is about 40 years old.  I need to upgrade my electrical panel.  I need insulation - heck, maybe even get rid of my lawn due to this fuss about residential watering.

How it works is that they lend you the money and how it gets paid back in via your local taxes every year.  The amount of money gets applied to a lien on your home.  That lien takes first position.

Interest rate is 8.35%.  APR is 12.00%.  Twenty years.

So what I understand is the draw back of this is it makes it a bit more complicated if you want to make any moves on the home, like sell it or refi.  Lenders don't want to be in second position, so they might not borrow to a seller for a subject property that has a lien unless its paid off first.

What I like about it is it's not one of these lease programs where the solar company eats the tax credit and incentives.  And with the types of upgrades to the house it seems to me it will increase my house's worth.  

I've been approved for 85k, and I figure that will basically take care of all the upgrades I want to do.

economy,Aussie maintains gains post RBA,"As expected by economists and market participants Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has kept policy rates on hold at 2.25%.

Aussie flew from its intraday low around 0.757 and traded around 0.771 post RBA decision. However pair is struggling to solidify gains above 0.77, currently trading at 0.768.
Overall trend remains downwards, possibilities are high that rallies will remain capped. Contrasting economic fundamentals and monetary policy will be keeping the pair pressed to downside.

Important short term resistance area is around 0.79-0.80, however 0.766-0.77 would continue to pose some resistance as of now.

Key highlights from RBA statement -

RBA takes note of worsening terms of trade with falling key commodity prices.
Growth in Australia is below trend and business capital expenditure is weak.
Lower rates are boosting housing prices and lending in the sector, RBA will be working with regulators to contain risks from housing markets.
Inflation and employment will remain weak.
According to RBA, Aussie is still strong compared to a basket of currencies other than the dollar. Central Bank also kept the policy easing door open for future.

personalfinance,I recently started an Indexed Universal Life (IUL) Insurance policy. Did I make the right decision for my future?,"Before I begin, I'd like to mention that, although I read up on insurance policies through the sidebar, I'm not entirely familiar with the different insurance policies and financial lingo, so please excuse my ignorance. I've also read about IUL through searching for related posts and it seems the overall opinion of it on this sub is that it's unnecessary and a scam that benefits the life insurance company. Apparently, IUL is too good to be true and that I shouldn't be viewing it as a savings account, but I am viewing it as a savings account because the interest rate is greater than my Wells Fargo savings account. I still don't understand why IUL is viewed so negatively and I was hoping someone provides unbiased advice. I am posting this to learn as much as I can from this community and all that it stands for, which I think is very educational, so thank you.

Here's a little about my current situation:

* I'm 23, single, and recently graduated from a 4-year university with a liberal arts degree. My parents value education and paid off my loans, but I need to pay them back half once I land a stable job.
* I live with my parents and currently make ~$600/month from tutoring, but I recently got a job teaching English in South Korea that will make me $2000/month for a contract period of one year (I may extend my stay if I like living and working there). Once I return to the states, I plan to study for my credentials and become a licensed teacher.

A friend of mine talked me into buying insurance 3 months ago, and we decided that this policy was best for me because I am risk averse and like to save whenever I can. I went through with it because it seemed like a ""savings"" account to me with more interest (8%) than my Wells Fargo savings account (less than 1%). So far I have invested $225. I haven't thought about what I want to do with the money I save, but most likely it will go towards starting a family, buying a house/condo, etc.

With that beings said, I am wondering if I made the correct financial decision for myself and need unbiased advice because I don't understand a lot of what is stated in my policy package.

* My current policy ($200k) entails that I pay $75/month for 10 years, which adds up to ~$9,000 at the end of my policy. I assume it will be lower because, although it states there will be no surrender fee when at the end of my policy period, the money may be taxed by the government.
* My minimum monthly premium is $52.80 and the monthly guarantee premium is $69.66.
* Minimum coverage amt: $100k
* Minimum face amt per coverage segment: $25k
* Loan interest rate: 4.20%
* Please let me know if I'm missing other important information needed to assess my policy.

I'm confused as to whether buying this policy was financially beneficial to me in the long term. Some of my remaining questions are:

* Will I really be saving in the long term?
* Do the tax benefits outweigh the costs?
* Do I need life insurance like this that helps me save or am I better off canceling this policy while I'm not as financially invested (I have to make another payment on April 11, which will bring me to $300 invested) and continue saving my money in my bank's savings account?
* Is it possible to change my policy to a different one like term insurance policy? If so, it is worth doing so to save?

**Edit**: I just finished skimming through this [online book about IUL](http://my-safe-money.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/The-Retirement-Miracle.pdf) and the author has nothing to say but good things about IUL. It sounds too good to be true, just like what my friend was telling me when he sold me the policy. Has anybody else read this?

**Edit2**: After hours of reading sites like Investopedia, [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/wpgp3/what_exactly_does_universal_life_insurance/) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2wbb8n/advantagesdisadvantages_of_an_indexed_universal/), and [this unbiased article](http://whitecoatinvestor.com/a-serious-reply-more-arguing-about-iul/), I decided to cancel my IUL policy and minimize my losses. In my current financial situation, I realized I made a mistake purchasing IUL. I was not well-informed or financially prepared to purchase life insurance. I'm still young, so I will have more opportunities to purchase life insurance in the future. I now understand that, although life insurance is important, viewing it as an investment is not the best way to go about purchasing a policy. I will consider getting life insurance again, as I start to develop more concrete financial and life goals. I also hope to find a financial adviser (and not a insurance salesman) whose goal is to inform me about my financial situation and possibilities, so I can make an informed decision myself.",finance,1428396806

All through 2012, though, Maryland continued to take out state taxes while DC did not. I foolishly did not make this connection when I did my federal taxes (it was my first time filing alone) and the service I used to file federal filed for state for me, so I didn't really think twice; I was just happy to have it finished.

Now DC's asking for taxes and my emergency fund can't cover what I owe plus whatever late fees they'll add. I'm going to file for a full refund from Maryland, but something tells me that'll be a struggle and DC won't be willing to wait until I get it back.

personalfinance,Is there a chance i may still get my money back?,"Some time back I was selling my car because I did not have a need to keep it anymore.

So this guy wanted to buy it but was in califormia. I told him about the car and such. And he wanted to buy it.

I said certified bank check only because I figured it would easily be caught if it was fake. Turns out it was fake. But I did not know this.

I deposited the check and paid for a shipping service to get the car. (He reimbursed me, this was the first red flag I did not realize was a scam).

Well, I only paid (Through western union, second red flag I did not catch) because my bank posts funds and unfortunatly this lead me to believe the check cleared when in reality it did not. So a few days later the bank cancelled the check and said it was a fake check. Now i am out about 1300 dollars I paid to a fake (Its amazing how real they make things look) shipping company.

The good news is I stopped fedex and got my title back. And nobody came for the car. I am happy to say I still have my car and I am modifying it for some fun at the track.

I reported this everywhere I could think of. Is there a way I could continue to help get my money back?

I tried to trace the IP addresses of the emails that he sent. It lead to 2 different places in california. I tried contacting the first one which seemed to be a business. They never replied. I have the google voice number and emails still.
I had the supossed shipping company email shut down by microsoft for fraud.

Who could I send all this information to so I can help catch this scammer?

Even if my money is not recovered (although i hope it can be), I still want to try and catch this person.

Aperently western union takes a photo/video of the people who collect money. Is there a way to get this to the FBI other than simply reporting it online to their internet crime division?

My best advice to others is to only accept a cash transfer in person at the bank with the two of you together.

Unfortunatly I had learned my lesson the hard way but at least it did not hurt worse than it could have.

I sent in my 1040-V with a check to my state tax institution (at the same time as federal) by certified mail. Has not yet been delivered to state tax institution. It was mailed in late March. Federal was funnily enough, delivered.

To avoid a penalty, do I submit another payment? On-line maybe?

What if the state receives it later on and tries to cash the check? Do I cancel the check and get a penalty from the state for a bad check? 
Would I get a refund of the overpayment if I don't cancel the payment?

personalfinance,Buying a Home &amp; Recovering from old Debts,"Long time lurker, first time poster...I'm actually nervous to post this based on responses I've seen.  But here we go!

I appreciate anyone who reads this, I'll try to be succinct as possible while providing all necessary details.

My wife and I have never been truly ""out of debt"".  Be it paying for an unnecessarily large wedding, having kids immediately, buying a townhouse soon thereafter.  You name it.  We make good salaries and aren't extravagant spenders but are still paying for mistakes of the past.

We're pregnant with our 3rd child, due soon, and are looking to purchase our final single family home (selling current townhouse).  Here are some of our financial stats to be followed by a specific question...

* Only source of income is jobs - 200k a year.
* Her 401k is essentially gone after we pulled it to pay for this house as a loan (changed jobs after that and had to deal with early withdrawal).
* My 401k is okay but currently repaying loans on it.  5 separate loans at 1000 (total) per month.  They all end separately over the next 3 years.
* 2238 a month, mortgage + escrow + home warranty
* 1200 a month, daycare


* **401k Loans**
* All loans are 3.25% interest rate paid back into my account
* Loan 1 - 257 a month, 8100 left, Payoff 10/17
* Loan 2 - 235 a month, 9700 left, Payoff 09/18
* Loan 3 - 99 a month, 2200 left, Payoff 12/16
* Loan 4 - 183 a month, 4600 left, Payoff 03/17
* Loan 5 - 218 a month, 7500 left, Payoff 01/18

* 500 a month, Discover Loan, Payoff 5/16
* 500 a month, loan to parents who provided us down payment (no interest), Payoff 12/22 (10 years but planned to increase after 4-5 years to pay down sooner)
* 260 a month, school for eldest daughter
* 125 a month, gym fees
* 400 a month, cable/phone bill
* 300 a month, utilities
* 77 a month, HOA
* 90 a month, life insurance
* 180 a month, car payment, 4000 left on loan, 4% interest
* 40 a month, car insurance

* **Credit Card**
* CC1 - 8000 total, 250 min, 27% interest
* CC2 - 4500 total, 150 min, 24% interest
* CC3 - 4500 total, 150 min, 19% interest
* CC4 - 800 total, 60 min, 4% interest

* ** Student Loans**
* Loan 1 - 75 a month, 5% interest, 3500 left
* Loan 2 - 163 a month, 6% interest, 13000 left
* Loan 3 - 181 a month, 6% interest, 10000 left

* 2600 a month (budgeted), living expenses.  Gas, groceries, everything else.  Based on averages since 2009, we average 1700 a month in these categories

The long and short of it is we pull in about 10400 after taxes and shell out about 9600 in expenses.  In a perfect world we'd stay in this house until all CC debt is cleared and we've removed some of the 401k loans to clear up some of our monthly income.  But this isn't a perfect world and we all answer to someone right?

We went to a mortgage lender to talk options yesterday which was great because it showed us how much our payment would go up and we know that we cannot make that happen in our current state.  But it led to questions on how we can reduce our monthly expenses to make that payment affordable.

**Option 1** - Based on a lot of posts here this may be a dumb question...Should we take the rest of the 401k loans I have as an early withdrawal and pay the penalty?  That would immediately free up 1000 a month.  That could be turned around and used to clear CC debt.

**Option 2** - Wait a year and get a few more CCs paid off to free up some monthly income?  We are currently (for the first time ever) at a place where income exceeds debts and are starting to crawl out of our perpetual hole.

I appreciate any advice that may come.  Perfect is truly the enemy of good in our situation, but we're really trying to make it right.",finance,1428414372

personalfinance,About to graduate with a worthless degree and a shitty job. Can I afford my lifestyle? (21/USA),"Finishing up my last semester for a degree that is completely worthless - the field it’s based in is highly competitive and primarily freelance. When I was 17, I followed everyone’s advice to pick something I loved, and now feel like a giant idiot.

--

I have about $25k in student loans, all federal, interest rates ranging from 3.4% to 6.8%. About $12k is unsubsidized, so they’ve accrued about 1.5k in interest so far (totalling ~27k).

--

I have a job that I’ve been working since freshman year, and will be able to get full-time hours (with guaranteed overtime) once I graduate. I hate the place I work - awful coworkers, disorganized management - but have no other prospects. They also pay me more than minimum wage, which is what I’d earn at other, similar jobs (retail).

--

My pay is about 14/hr or ~$2000/mo on full-time hours (a little more with additional overtime during our busy season).
I have around $20k in savings that I’d prefer not to touch unless I absolutely have to.

--

So, here’s what the budget looks like:   
Rent: ~800/mo  (this is low for where I live)  
Utilities: 35/mo  
Internet: 30/mo  
Transportation: 116/mo  
Student Loans: ~300/mo+, starting in November  
Food: ~350/mo (trying to bring this down. I know all the subreddits, I just have no time to cook)   
Misc expenses: ~100  

--

No cell phone bill (generous parents), no cable, no gym membership. I very rarely go out or spend money on myself, so no entertainment budget listed.  

--

So, the question: is this doable? Repaying my loans on my paycheck, affording rent, etc? I’ve read so many horror stories about graduates with my degree in the current market (and it doesn’t help that it’s a field that PF constantly belittles, so every similar thread I’ve read here makes me feel even worse).

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Conference. Prague,"Bitcoin Conference is going to make a mash on Europe. Meet the conference dedicated to the currency of the future in Prague!
Everyone has heard about a mysterious currency Bitcoin, but maybe not everyone knows where and what you can spend it on.

After that, many Russian companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry have moved to Europe, where there are no restrictions for Bitcoin business. 
In addition, the conference organizer is in an attempt to develop and promote digital currency; and central-eastern regions of Europe are an ideal place for the realization of this ambition. 
Bitcoin Conference Prague wants to serve as a unique platform for the exchange of experience between Russian companies, which have something to say and to show Europe, and their foreign counterparts. 
That is why, in the heart of Europe, in the historic city of Prague, the organizers will bring together not only the Czech Bitcoin community, but also participants from Russia, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Germany, and in general all Bitcoin enthusiasts of Central and Eastern Europe.

I'm wondering if we should, or even legally can, file my wife's taxes as single.  If I list her as married and plug her W2 into TurboTax, she immediately owes the fed $100 dollars, and is getting a state refund of $150.  

If I input her W2 while listing her as single, her immediate refund is $777 federal, and $297 state.

personalfinance,Am I crazy for wanting to go on a roadtrip? [US],"Hey there,

I am about ready to finish my degree and was thinking about taking a several thousand mile roadtrip across the US as a reward and as a chance to learn and grow.

Here's the facts:

* I am a 20 year old male in fairly good shape. No health issues whatsoever.

* I currently hold a BA in Criminal Justice, Eagle Scout rank, Private Pilot License, various different certs (motorcycle, scuba, skydiving, advanced first aid...) and am completely crime/drug free. I also have current passport and EID.

* I have employment offers from 6 state and federal agencies (contingent upon me turning 21 next March) and from 9 private companies.

* I have $2k in my bank account, $1.5k in savings account, $5k in guns, $1k in gold, $1k in silver, a fully paid off truck (reliable, safe, average of 28mpg), absolutely no debt and parents that would willingly help if I got stuck.

* Other than a 75m backpacking trip planned for September/October, I have no obligations this summer or other ties to home.

* My parents have been pushing me to take a roadtrip.

* When I start working, I recognize that I will most likely work until I retire (if I have it planned out correctly, should be about 68 with double pension)

I've been thinking about just saying fuck it and going for a trip around the country to learn and grow but I'm concerned about the logistics. I've road tripped before (~1500 miles one way to my job with the State Troopers up in Alaska back in 2013) but this would not have have a specific destination in mind. Furthermore, when I was traveling up to Alaska, I was employed and was making more than enough to offset the costs.

Another complicating factor is that I've been talking to a woman on OKCupid who wants to do this with me. She is in almost the exact same situation and we get along well. maintaining a relationship would be entirely possible. Only problem is that she's in Canada. :/

Here's the questions which I have:

1) Is this entirely ludicrous?

2) How much money do I need to budget? 

3) If we were to work temp jobs in each new area we visited (bussing tables, helping around farms, doing yardwork) how much could we realistically extend our reserves?

4) How effective would it be to use Craigslist to find jobs in the areas which we were planning on moving to next?

I think that is pretty much everything. Has anybody around here done something like this before?

personalfinance,How can I most efficiently/safely deal with expenses associated with planned unemployment and move? [Southern CA],"Hi PF,

I am starting a fully-funded PhD program in the fall (late September). In order to give myself time to brush up on my academics, spend several weeks with family, get away from a shitty job, and generally enjoy my summer before I put my nose to the grindstone, I'm planning on leaving my current job on May 15th.  My boyfriend and I are moving in together ~June 1st (or slightly before, depending on when we finalize a new apartment).  We'll mostly be furnishing from scratch, though I do already have a mattress, some decorations, and most of the requisite kitchen supplies.  Here's a quick breakdown of my current and future financial situation:

~$1650/mo income (paid biweekly, hourly+overtime)

* $5700 currently in e-fund
* $795/mo rent+utilities (currently), likely $650-$700 total in new place
* $200/mo into savings
* $131 car+renters insurance
* $137 federal subsidized loan (~3.1% interest with autopay, current balance $10,280)
* $60 gas
* $160 groceries
* the rest goes to incidentals/entertainment/personal care

Obviously I will not have that income from May-August.  When the program starts, I get a $8000 ""one-time scholarship"" (basically relocation/signing ""bonus"") in addition to my stipend ($26,400 for the first year).

I currently put everything besides bills/loans/insurance on my AmEx Blue Cash card and pay in full every month ($2000 limit, 14.99% APR, but I never carry a balance).  I also have a USAA platinum mastercard that I only pay my internet with, because it's limit is $300 and the rewards aren't as good (9.90%APR, again no balance carried).

Given that I will be obviously dipping into savings to fund the move/period of unemployment, would it be a good idea for me to open a new card with an introductory 0% APR, use it to cover my incidental expenses, and make minimum payments until I get my $8000 in September? I figure that way I can take advantage of CC rewards/increase my credit score via decreased utilization/keep my e-fund at a safe level until I start making money again.  Is it a good idea to do this, vs. just depleting my savings and recharging them in the fall?

Edit: FWIW, my parents have offered to ""help me out"" with an undetermined amount of money for the summer, and I will also be visiting home for about 1 month total (i.e. no cost of groceries/gas/incidentals)",finance,1428428464

personalfinance,"Graduate student in a somewhat struggling field. No debt (might be later), no savings, no idea.","I’m a 30 year old graduate student and plan to complete my program in 2 years.  I would like to set things up so I have supplemental income and can start putting anything, even if it’s a small amount, towards my savings and/or retirement. 

 

I get a fellowship through my program which includes tuition remission and a meager stipend.  I live paycheck-to-paycheck and have no savings left over; there is no way I can get another job because I work a significant amount every week for my current program, its various responsibilities, and a part-time job - I’m struggling to maintain my sanity because not only do I work a lot, I have irregular hours.  The whole program has taken its toll on my physical and mental health but it's too late to turn back now.

 

I have no federal student loans or private loans, but I don’t have any savings either.  To make matters worse, I might have to take loans for the next two years: next year, I may need it to support myself due to funding issues and the year after, I will be completing a type of “residency” where I’ll be make 20K as my salary. The latter depends on where I get placed so I don’t know if I’ll have to take out more or less in terms of my loans.  The average salary in my field after I graduate in 2017 will be 40K for the next few years, and then ~70-80K thereafter.

 

I don’t know what to do.  I’m trying to keep costs down as much as possible but I was wondering if you know of anything else I could do to bring in any (passive?) income, whether I should take private loans or public loans (I keep getting conflicting information on this), and what I can do now to set myself up financially since I’ll be somewhat restricted over the next few years.  I'm stressed out because I know I'll have to deal with other financial issues around the time I graduate, like finding an apartment or buying a home, getting a car, etc. I want to get ahead in life, financially.

personalfinance,Should I take out a large loan from my parents (4%) or the government (6.8%)?,"Okay, here's my deal:

I am going to grad school this fall (yes, it will be worthwhile when I get out). Right now, I have $10,000 in undergraduate loans with the interest rate for the majority of that at 5.75%. I'm going to need to take out additional loans for the next two years. I was offered the maximum $20,500 at 6.8% from the government for the first year. I plan on working as much as possible, but it would be likely I'd need to take out that same amount the following year.

However, my parents have offered to lend me money for all of my undergraduate and graduate loans at a 4% (maybe even a tiny bit lower) interest rate.

If I take loans from the government, I calculate that I'll owe roughly $335/month in interest when I graduate. If I take the loan from my parents, that amount will be under $200/month. Another benefit would be that I could pay the loan back at any rate that I want without having to worry about minimum payments (though I fully plan on aggressively paying it back with far more than the minimum).

My question is: are there **any reasons not** to borrow the money from my parents? The only thing I can think of is that I won't be able to claim the student loans on my taxes, right? Is there anything else that would hurt me financially by taking on the loan from my parents?

finance,Internship/Career advice,"Backstory: I applied to a few firms and corp. finance departments where I had some small connections, nothing bulgebracket, and I got turned down at all of them, citing my GPA (2.5) as the reason. This is terrible, I know. Long story short, I wanted to be an author, didn't bother in HS since I was gonna write all my life, got to college, same attitude, etc. 

When I finally got my act together, changed majors and started working on my grades, it was too late. At least in the short run, I have a 3.9 this semester and looking to graduate within the 3.3-3.7 range overall, and probably a 3.5-3.8 major GPA so I'm not too worried about the future. (end backstory)


I am, however, worried about my current situation; having very few options for internships now, as in, graduating with no 
_relevant_ work experience. 

While my GPA isn't a good reflection of it, I'd say I'm pretty intelligent (high test scores with very limited studying) and I'm a very fast learner. I've learned valuation, modeling, etc. I know accounting (my family are accountants) and I'm interested in economics. I start my days off with headlines relevant to the industry, etc. 

The important part: 

I've managed to scrape together a few things to make the summer not a complete waste. Mainly, commercial banking and an economic research position with a professor at my school. I'm wondering what I should prioritize in terms of opportunities?

Would the commercial banking be better experience than research assistant with a professor? How about an accounting position somewhere? Tax accounting more relevant than public, etc? These are the questions I'm faced with and stuck on. I'm a junior so I have, at best, two summers for internships left before I'm on the job hunt. 

My school literally has no alumni directory, the finance clubs are accounting dominated, very few internship opportunities there. The rest of my networking connections are commercial and accounting.

My dream/goal is to end up in BB banks/M&amp;A, head to PE, and I'd love to finish my career with a job in the fed somewhere. (I know the reality of this)

Story time. I graduated from college about five years ago with a bachelor's degree, just short of $40k in student loans, and nary a dime to my name. It didn't seem wise to immediately head out into private industry without any money or experience in the field, so I applied for an entry level programming job at that same university, and got it. At ~~$45k~~ $52k per year gross, it's below the industry average, but it's low stress, close to home, and the hours and benefits are good. Hell, I'm writing this at work right now.

Fast-forward five years, and I've still got the same job, now making around 10% more between COLA and a raise I got in the second year. Thing is, my student loans are paid off, some legal fees are paid off ($15k), I bought and paid off a new car ($30k), I've got $10k in mutual funds, three years of maxed out Roth IRAs ($18k), and $90k in my 401k. I'm 29.

I rent/share a decent place ($800/mo), I eat out almost every day ($400/mo), my 401k contribution is ($350/mo), I've got cheap car insurance ($40/mo), cheap health insurance ($56/mo), and other than about ($200/mo) in misc. groceries and gas, that's it for my steadily-decreasing monthly expenses. At this point, every other net paycheck is completely disposable, and then some.

I know *what* to do with my spare income to get the most out of it, so that's not the issue, I just don't understand *why* my situation seems exceptional for my income level. I don't want to own a house or have kids, but that's not too unusual for my generation.

It feels like I'm already living well and spending my money freely on whatever I want, but I really don't make that much, and even with a few big unnecessary expenses I've got a lot left over. Am I missing some big expense that ""normal"" people have?

I currently have a mortgage at 4.375% interest and received a quote today for a 3.75% rate with a lender credit that would charge no points and would cover all closing costs (outside of escrow and prepaid interest which I would basically get back in a few months). Seems to be a no brainer and would save me about $1,700 a year (not adjusted for the change in the mortgage interest tax deduction). I'm currently at around 15% equity, and have to pay PMI. But the PMI would likely be lower as the value of my home has increased since the original loan inception (although my current lender, USAA, allows me to petition out of PMI once I reach 20% equity at any time, a new lender would probably make me pay PMI at least 2-3 years per the loan officer).  Maybe I'm missing something here. Other than possibly getting a less reputable loan servicer (currently with USAA, very reputable, new servicer could be anyone as this would be through a broker, hence the lender credit) and possibly ending up paying more for PMI, I can't figure out why I WOULDN'T refinance. What am I missing?

Also I don't want to pay closing costs or points because I am not sure how long I will stay in the current home. I would guess at least three years but not sure. So for me, it's no cost for a lower interest rate or no deal.",finance,1428444381

Is my best option applying for a personal loan from a bank? I am a (nearly) college graduate with around $40,000 in loans already.

personalfinance,Investing in Stock (vs. Savings),"So I just moved all my money to Ally, where the savings account interest rate is .99%.  I was pretty excited about it, until I started looking at various stock performance over the past year.  Amazon grew by 16%; Apple by 80%.  In the long run, Apple outperforms the market: http://performance.morningstar.com/stock/performance-return.action?t=AAPL

It makes me want to put most most of my savings into some ""safe"" tech stocks.  But then there's Google, which went down 2%.  So I guess the safer thing to do is keep the money in savings or a CD (but 1.3% sounds paltry in light of the stock returns)...or if I want to be kinda risky, some index funds.  

Another thing I have to keep in mind is that the returns on the stock will be taxed, which discounts the return.  But I can't imagine it'll lead to a net growth of less than 1%.

personalfinance,"I am a full time student, just received $6500 of my student loans in cash, what is the best way to put this to use?","First off let me provide a little context. I attend a private University, tuition is around $55,000 a year. I get financial aid, and some parent support so I only pay about $14,000 a year(all federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans). Further information, my school has an accelerated BA-MA program for certain majors. I am enrolled in that, based on undergrad GPA a certain amount of tuition is taken off by tuition remittance. So now with remittance and some parental help my personal expense(again, Stafford loans) has dropped to about $7,000.
 It took the Financial-Aid people time to calculate this, so I took out more Fed-loans than I needed, Fin-Aid sent me back the difference and I now have $6500 cash from the University in my bank account. 
 I already decided that I will keep a chunk of this as I have been strapped for grocery money this year, having more intense studies and a required internship I had to cut back on my paid work. 

So here is my first ever PF question for you fine people. Whats the best thing to do with lets say $5000. Should I give it back now? Put it into my regular savings and not touch it? Put it in a CD for a year?

Rent: $200

Car Payment: $300

Car Insurance: $130

Parental Loan: $200

Cell Phone: $70

I put $500 a month away in savings for my university tuition and emergencies. There is currently $1000 in the account.

Debt (This is where it gets fun...)

Mastercard: $1800 @ 19.99%

Visa: $1000 @ 12.99%

Loan from Parents: $6800 @ 0%. I give them $200 a month towards this loan which is included in bills.

New vehicle: $17,500 @ 4.99%. I make $300 payments each month which is included in my bills. I'm not really worried about this. 

My goal is to apply all my spare money to my credit cards for the next few months and completely eliminate the debts. However, I still worry about my situation and feel like I owe a LOT. Owning a good car is a necessary evil where I live (rural area, no public transportation, bad roads), so I am not too worried about that. However, the interest rate on my cards is so high and I've paid an average of $50 a month in interest this year.

personalfinance,Some questions for rent vs buy?,"So I finally am getting started in my career which means some potential changes. Long story short my wife and I have been living with family and since my new job we started looking at apartments she's started talking about buying a house. 

We were looking at apartments that would be $1,200-$1,400. She works in real estate and found that for the same price we qualify for a mortgage. 

Her credit is good, mine is bad because I have no established credit beyond my car loan and lots of medical bills. I've got a credit card and have gotten my debt almost entirely paid off ($800 to go). In 3-6 months my credit score will be much better. 

She insists that we already qualify for a mortgage and using the resources available for first time home buyers we can do it. 

Is that true?

I feel like there is a big difference between ""qualified"" and can pay the bill vs being able to afford it. 

Now arguably the biggest mistake I made was telling my wife about something I'm very blessed and fortunate to have. I have a trust fund with $170,000 in it. That isn't to say I can just go withdraw that. There's specific rules and at the end of the day, I can only use that IF I can qualify for a conventional mortgage without it. It's money I've lived my whole life pretending not to exist, so it's strange thinking about actually using it.

My concern is that any mortgage we qualify for will be at a very high interest rate. I'd like to use as little of that money as possible because it's a rare thing to have and be stupid to piss away.

My thoughts are to rent for a year, continue getting our credit up, and then look at houses. We'll be able to get a lower interest rate and it gives us the necessary chance to prove we can afford a mortgage.

I am thinking of possibly buying a multi-family within the next year and a half. I would be using a VA home loan. For those that don't know what it is here are the advantages of this loan.
""No down payment as long as the sales price doesn't exceed the appraised value.
No private mortgage insurance premium requirement.
VA rules limit the amount you can be charged for closing costs.
Closing costs may be paid by the seller.
The lender can't charge you a penalty fee if you pay the loan off early.
VA may be able to provide you some assistance if you run into difficulty making payments.""
I am looking at buying a $300,000-350,000 home with 3 housing units minimum. That is the average housing price in the area I am looking at. Hopefully I can find a cheaper price but that is as high as I am willing to pay. The main purpose of this purchase would be to rent all the units and gain extra income. I will have saved up around $35,000 by that time. Right now my housing is 100% taken care of, food, and health care. I have no vehicle and do not need one. My monthly bills are a $35 cell phone bill and $55 for internet. I also allow myself to spend up to $200 on a credit card every month for little things I want or may need. It is paid off every month on time. I have no debt and a very steady job. I also have a co-signer who is willing to help me out if I ever need it. We both have a credit score of over 700. I want a 35 year loan.
My concerns are my monthly income, it is pretty low. It is around $2000. Although I save a majority of my money. I am not even sure I would get approved because of my low income. I have done research and some math and it seems like I would be able to afford it. Considering I have virtually no real expenses. Would this be a good investment to make? Kind of nervous about taking such a big plunge.
I have taken into account mortgage, interest rate, property tax, and insurance. As for repairs I would use money from renting it for repairs. Or from my $35,000 of savings if I really do not need to use it as a down payment. Is there anything I am not taking into account for? Anything else I should know? What are your opinions on my situation? Is this a good idea? Tips on being a first time land lord and home owner?

1.) We need to move closer to my work as right now I am driving 45 miles to and from work. This is rapidly decreasing the value of my car and costing a lot in gas. She will also likely be getting a position closer to my work as well, so we can find a better place to live to make things easier.

2.) Gain more savings while reducing debts. My mom has always subscribed to the Dave Ramsey theory of no debt and has taught me to pay down these debts before saving big. I have been advised to get around $1k in savings and then pay off debts before saving more. 

2b.) Save up to buy a house in the next 2 years. We would like to start our family in around 3 years as we have an annuity paying around this time. We would ideally like to have our own home and stop renting before this time comes.

3.)Begin saving for our futures and learning how to invest appropriately, outside of our individual retirements. I am completely ignorant to investing and am wanting to learn where to start and where to read to get the necessary information.

If any of my goals or current plan can be improved upon, please educate me. I know not all agree with Ramsey and I'd be curious to hear all opinions. I am completely open to all suggestions and just want to gain a better understanding of it all, to set my family up for success.",finance,1428449847

on my bi-weekly paycheck, the percentage of my wages withheld for taxes varies, sometimes greatly. for example, one pay period i paid 17.2% of my gross wages (hourly and tips) in taxes, the next pay period 18.1%, the next pay period 12% and the next pay period 10.8%. by filing federally as 2, i realize less wages will be witheld than if i were to file 0 or 1. my manager (driver manager)  attempted to coax me out of talking to HR to have them break this down for me, which i thought was a red flag. he told me that ""the more money that you make, more money will be withheld.""

I'm a recent graduate fortunate enough to have graduated without any student loans and even more fortunate to get a great job out of college. I currently work full-time and pull in ~50k a year, with ridiculously great health insurance for $60 a month. 

I've had a change of heart and decided to go back to school for something I had initially went to college expecting to do, which is physical therapy. 

I'm planning on applying this fall for admission next May. I would be looking at a cost of ~75k total over 3 years, just for classes for the program using the tuition rate currently. Starting salary is around that same amount, give or take a few thousand. That isn't counting money needed for housing, food, gas, insurance, etc.

I'm not necessarily worried about paying back the loans, but more so looking for the best way to plan for this, to plan for losing my health insurance (going on parents' is not an option), to plan for not having a sizable monthly income anymore. 

Currently I have 7k in savings, 13k in a Roth IRA (11k of which is my investment), and 4k in a 457b and 403b account. 

I'd like to put away around $1000 a month until next May, which would put me at about $20k in cash. I've stopped contributions to my IRA, but still contribute to the 457 and my employer contributes to my 403b without me having to. 

My fixed monthly expenses total around $1,200 a month, my biggest expense being $600 for rent, but it includes all my utilities. 

What would be the best plan for this? Would it be wise to use my available cash the first year, in order to defer taking out loans and paying interest? I'm nearly positive I'd only be eligible for unsubsidized federal loans, up to 20k a year I believe. What about cashing out my principle investment from my IRA? I had always planned to just set it there and forget it, but it would be tempting to draw from it if it meant not taking out as many loans. 

Since I'd be quitting my job in May, I would have made around $20k or so for the year, and don't anticipate being able to work. Would I be eligible for subsidized healthcare immediately upon leaving my job? 

Any help would be great, I know it's a while, but it'd make me feel better going into this if someone could chime in with their experience doing the same, or just anyone with an opinion, really.",finance,1428451445

After my grandmother passed away last summer, I was gifted $5000 by my mother following the sale of my grandmother's house. I haven't touched the money, but feel as though I have three primary options:

1. Pay off a high-interest, private student loan (8% if memory serves correctly) slightly exceeding $5000

2. Use the $5000 as a down-payment toward the purchase of a house

3. Use the $5000 to be put toward purchasing a new/used car

As a bit of basic information, my only debts are student loans. I recently paid off the last of my credit card debt, and do not have any major purchases/emergency issues that I foresee on said card. I plan to contribute that payment to my savings month-to-month. My car ('98 Toyota Celica) has been paid off for five years, but seems to be hitting a high cost segment of maintenance. My current rent is about $775 (rent, water, heat, electric, &amp; internet), living on my own in a one-bedroom apartment. I work a full-time job as an assistant manager, and make enough to be comfortable, usually coming out ahead $100-300 a month depending on the time of year. I currently participate in an employer matched 401k (currently at the highest match rate) that I have been contributing to for little over a year. My bank pre-approved me for a loan that seems far higher than I could ever afford on a home, and I have been working with a realtor to check out some houses for the past two months.

My concerns mostly come down to what is the most reasonable thing to do. Clearing out that student loan would give me an extra $70 or so a month (completely aside from the low-interest state and federal loans), which doesn't seem like anything more than peace of mind that a loan is paid off. Buying a home is something that friends and family have been telling me to do, but with a price ceiling of only $85k, my options seem severely limited - especially when combined with another re-reading of [The Cost of Buying and Getting Settled into a House](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2xxf08/the_cost_of_buying_and_getting_settled_into_a_home/). Many of the homes in that range have either been *severe* ""fixer uppers,"" or while a great value in an ""up and coming neighborhood,"" lack a lot of amenities that I'd qualify as important (ie, energy saving windows and HVAC, leading to high fluctuations in heating/cooling). Finally with a vehicle, its more or less a thing that I'd like, but don't need *yet*. Because my car is getting old, the fuel mileage isn't great, and I'm coming up on a lot of expensive repairs that I can't do myself (clutch replacement, high wear parts coming up for replacement seemingly all at once), all while the value of my car has fallen through the floor over the past year or so. I'm being realistic with a purchase there, preferably going with a CPO or a realistic lease.

Personally, I'm not in any particular rush to make a specific choice, but I'd like to consider as many different viewpoints as possible before honing in on what the best decision would be. I'm interested to hear what advice you all may have, and thank you for your input!",finance,1428453494
investing,Impact of RBI policy rate decision on the market,"Although the RBI maintained status quo on policy rates in line with market expectations, the absence of liquidity easing measures and uncertainty over the timing of the next rate cut disappointed the market. 

In response to the policy announcement, the benchmark 10Y Indian government bond (IGB) yield and 5Y OIS rate rose 4bps and 7bps, respectively. 

The OIS curve bear flattened by 3bps. It is likely to maintain a Positive outlook on IGBs and recommend that investors buy 10Y IGBs. The stance is underpinned by the expectation of another 25bps policy rate cut during Q2-2015. Expectation of a subsequent 25bps policy rate cut has become more uncertain, however. 

To reflect this uncertainty, the target is fine-tuned for the long 10Y IGB trade recommendation and revised it to 7.50%, from 7.40% (entry: 8.08%, current: 7.77%; revised stop-loss: 8.00%). 

Standard Chartered says they do not think that the RBI's monetary policy easing cycle is over yet. Given the favourable CPI inflation dynamics until August 2015 (RBI estimate: c.4% y/y), they see room for the RBI to ease policy rates by at least 25bps. The 10Y IGB yield is currently trading c.27bps higher than the repo rate and is yet to price in further monetary easing, in their view. 

""We expect the markets to build up rate cut expectations closer to the June policy announcement, and remain range-bound until then. The near-term supply dynamics appear mixed. The planned net issuance in May is INR 771bn (versus April's INR 480bn), which is likely to exert supply pressure on IGBs"", Says Standard Chartered

However, June is a month of favourable supply dynamics, with IGB redemptions exceeding the planned issuance by INR 82bn - this should cap a significant rise in IGB yields.

investing,US Trilogy of Yellen-Fischer-Dudley speeches make minutes look old,"The minutes of the 17-18 March FOMC meeting will be released at 14:00 ET on Wednesday. 

The March statement no longer referred to a ""prudent"" stance, but the growth forecast downgrades, the lower 'dot plot' trajectory, and the lower forecasts for full-employment (now 5.1% unemployment) gave the meeting a dovish tone.

While it will be interesting to see how the FOMC members justified these adjustments, the minutes may look 'stale' as several important speeches since then (from Chair Yellen, Vice Chair Fischer, the New York Fed's Dudley) were mostly on the dovish side. 

Reference to a ""midyear"" rate hike has given way to one ""before year-end"". In addition, March payrolls were soft, vindicating the Fed's current caution.",finance,1428455933

personalfinance,Am I thinking about my Federal Allowance correctly?,"Married, and our federal tax refund this year was over $6000. I want to modify our W4s so as to get that number closer to 0 for next year. Last year my wife had 3 allowances and I had 1. We expect 2015 incomes to be similar to 2014. We are both taxed in the 25% bracket, and since each allowance reduces taxable income by 4000, every increment, by my calculation, would reduce taxes withheld by roughly 1000.

That suggests that our total allowances should increase by 6, to something like 5 and 5, but that seems ... extreme. Am I doing something wrong?",finance,1428457603

Right now my 401k is a Roth and I'm asking if I should change to a Trad 401k based on my FIRE plan:

Total: $307k + at least $23.5k more in '15  

**Retirement Plan**  
My goal is to retire early (NOW is very tempting) and possibly move to a state w/o income tax. But lets pretend that I'll stay where I am. I plan to live on my ~$59k pension/disability income alone so that my savings accounts will be there for emergencies and targeted spending when the market is good (read: not recurring lifestyle expenses). My budget says I can do it so long as I control housing expenses in retirement (another reason to move). See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/30r9i7/fire_check_for_a_42yo_military_retiree_currently/).  

Using today's brackets and standard deductions (ignoring deductible mortgage interest if I buy a house) my AGI would be $43.3k - $10.3 = $33k which puts me in the 15% bracket with ~$4k until I hit 25% and LTCG bumps from 0% to 15% (Right???)  

**All that boils down to:**  
Current Marginal Tax rate: 33.75%  
Retired LTCG Tax rate first $4k: 5.75% (state)  
Retired LTCG tax rate after $4k: 20.75% (federal + state)

Then when I retire I'll have as much as $4k headroom for a Roth Ladder at 5.75% ... even more if I buy a house and deduct mortgage interest, and if I want more it would still be taxed at most 20.75%

personalfinance,New job opportunity in San Francisco vs current job in Cleveland,"Hello, I'm hoping to get some advice or suggestions in terms of my current financial outlook should I stay where I am doing what I am, whether this new opportunity is financially viable, and if so, where my ceiling should be in terms of rent and other expenses.

**Some background on my current situation:**

**Income sources**

* I am a 22 year old Software Engineer, with a Computer Engineering major and a Computer Science minor,  living in Cleveland Ohio with a base salary of $55,000 no bonus or equity. 

* My employer offers 100% 401k matching up to 3% plus an additional 50% match from 3-5%. 

* I am paid Bi-monthly, so my gross income per paycheck is $2,291.67 

* My federal taxable income after 401k contributions, healthcare/dental, TRIP parking expenses, etc. is $2071.88

* My adjusted per-paycheck income after taxes is $1523.59

**Debts/expenses**

* I have a balance of $25,180 in stafford loans as follows

 *  Direct subsidized stafford loan; principal balance $3,371.29 at 4.25%, principal balance 8702.77 at 3.15%, principal balance 5,336.04 at 3.61%
 *  Direct unsubsidized stafford loan; principal balance $5,813.98 at 6.55%, principal balance $1,946.71

 * My minimum payment is $275/month, and I have consistently been paying $325/month

* I am in the process of building a home 
 * Currently an interest only construction loan until completion, and will then transition to a 15 year ARM of $230,600 (I can't find the exact rate currently). 
 * The bank appraised the cost to build including land to be ~$450,000
  * The discrepancy between the loan value and the appraised cost is due to my family being in construction and being able to build effectively at cost. 
 * My parents will be helping to cover a portion of the home expenses and mortgage, as my younger brother who is still a student will be living with me, and they have planned to put what they would pay the university in housing (and possibly a bit more) towards those expenses. 
 * If I were to take the job or otherwise move to a different location, my parents have said the plan would be to put both their home and the home I am building up for sale, and simply keep one or the other and helping to cover the associate costs of the home I am building with the proceeds from either sale. 
* Additional monthly expenses are pretty sporadic right now, as I have been traveling a bit and spending more money than I probably should be. This would be certainly adjusted as I begin making payments on the home mortgage. 


**The Opportunity**
 
* My offer package would be as follows for a software engineering position based in San Francisco:
* Salary of $100,000/year, with a $7,000 signing bonus to help offset relocation costs. 
* 50% 401k match up to 6% of income
* Healthcare and other pre tax expenses seem to be about the same
* In terms of a car, I would plan to sell my current vehicle (2008 Dodge Nitro R/T), which is paid off in full, and stick to public transportation and walking/biking in the city, and if I was interested in areas outside of San Francisco something like zip car or potentially purchasing a motorcycle. 
* Again, Bi-monthly pay, so gross income per paycheck is $4,166.67
* This position would be up to 75% travel
 * You might find yourself wondering why I would want to live in San Francisco, and pay the absurd cost of living, when I'll be traveling so heavily. San Francisco and silicon valley has been my dream since I decided to go into Computer Engineering. 
* Since I am young, don't really know anyone in the Bay Area and in the tech industry, I have really been focused on living downtown as an opportunity to meet people, and obviously live a bit more adventurous lifestyle
 * If living downtown is simply not financially possible for me, please let me know, and I'll start looking at some other options. 
 * The places I have been looking at have been ~2500-3000/month in studios and 1BR apartments, obviously with no roommate.
 * Im open to the idea of a roommate, but if I were to go that route I would probably look into some short term housing so that I can move out there learn the city a bit and hopefully meet some people that I might be interested in living with.

personalfinance,I am 25 years old and live with my parents. They are retiring to Florida and I don't plan on going with them. My debt is high and income low. I need a plan - any advice would help.,"Hello /r/PersonalFinance!

I would first like to begin by thanking you for reading my post. It is long and it is thorough. I want to create the clearest picture possible in order to receive the best advice I can. I have lurked for many months but it's time for me to leave the shadows and ask for help directly. I truly appreciate anything anyone has to offer. I am deeply grateful for this sub and the people who frequent it.

**About Me**

I am 25 years old and currently live with my parents. At the end of the year, they will be retiring and moving to Florida. Because of this, I decided to get my finances in order hopefully creating a plan to get things under control. 

I have a 2 year degree in Recording and Music Technology and a 2 year degree in General Studies. I was enrolled in an Electrical Engineering program for a year before my loans caught up to me. Financial aid fell through resulting in the return to my parents house and I have been here since.

Knowing what loomed over the horizon, I decided to take the opportunity of living at home rent free to save as much as I could. I currently sit on $15,000 in savings.

**Income**

I work for a local hospital making $13.85 per hour claiming 3 federal allowances. 

As of the end of February, I've begun to contribute 10% of my bi-weekly pay to a pre-tax 401(b) through Lincoln Financial - selecting the 2055 retirement portfolio. My company also contributes 2.5% of my yearly salary to a 401(k) through Lincoln Financial - again selecting the 2055 retirement portfolio . 

I pay $18.24 bi-weekly for health insurance, short term disability, vision, and supplemental life insurance. 

After all is said and done, my take home pay every two weeks is $798.10.

**Expenses**

Though I currently live with my parents and they require no room or board, as of July 1st I will be renting an apartment with my girlfriend for $800 per month. Everything is included except for electricity. We plan to split costs right down the middle and expect to budget $600 per month each for rent, food, electric, pets, and misc costs. We have a joint account for joint expenses and intend to save what we don't spend monthly for joint emergencies.

My largest expense aside from the future apartment is my car which averages about $250 per month in gas, maintenance, insurance, and misc fees. When I move, I will be about a mile from work almost eliminating this expense entirely. 

Additional miscellaneous expenses total $100 per month for the occasional night out, personal treats, and things of that nature. 

I have had to be extremely frugal in the past and know I am capable to do it again moving forward.

**Debt**

Here's the biggie - I don't want to get into how or why these numbers are the way they are. I'm sure everyone here is well aware how easy it can be. Never the less, here are the figures:

Private Loans - $17,054 @ 7.4% with $1,595.93 in unpaid interest. Currently sitting in forbearance until 5/15/16. I am not currently making any payments on this loan. 

Federal Loans - $34,764.64 @ [multiple interest rates](http://imgur.com/KOC1DXu) with  $1,681.49 in unpaid interest. I applied for the Income Based Repayment plan last year resulting in $0.00 monthly payments. As of May 1st, payments increase to $76 per month. I also applied for Public Service Loan Forgiveness and intend to save for the taxes that occur upon forgiveness.

Parent Plus Loan - I do not have direct access to these figures but I do know the total amount sits around $47,000 @ ~7%. I do not currently make payments on this loan.

**Where do I go from here?**

I know the typical response to many of these questions but I feel my situation is different due to the insane amount of debt and extremely limited education/income prospects.

* Should I consolidate my Federal Loans?

* Should I continue to save and use that savings to pay off the private loan in full?

* Should I pay the interest off on all my loans and start tackling the highest interest rate?

* What should I do about the Parent Plus Loan? I'm sure it'll cost $500 per month when it gets called up.

* Was it a good idea or logical to sign up for the Loan Forgiveness plan?

* Should I keep contributing to my retirement account?

* Is there any way I can turn my savings into something more?

* Should I bother going back to a local community college for some sort of trade/certificate/relevant education or just work, work, work?

* What am I doing wrong/right?

personalfinance,Filing amendment. Would balancing additional income and deductions for 0 net effect be ok?,"Alright, here's my situation. I did some googling/searching and I couldn't find anything like it. I just got a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) in the mail last week from a trust my mother set up before she passed away. I had received one $600 pay-out in 2014 from this trust. I had been under the mistaken assumption that it was tax free as an inheritance. (It's apparently not, because the $600 was from income that the trust had made in 2014)

At this point I've already filed my federal and state (Ohio) taxes. Now I need to do an amendment, which sounds like a pain in the ass. Here's my question: I forgot to contribute to my HSA (Health Savings Account) before filing my taxes this year. Can I contribute $600 to my HSA to bring the net change in tax refunds/payments to $0? Will that raise red flags for the IRS and earn me an audit? I can probably deal with an audit if it comes to it, but I really would rather skip the hassle.

personalfinance,60k salary earner looking to consolidate 100k+ private loans and lower monthly payments.,"Hi guys. A co-worker mentioned to me that he got sound advice and perspective from this forum so I thought I'd give it a try. 

Here's a few facts about me. I'm a character designer for Cartoons and make 65k per year. Below is a breakdown of my loan debt including lenders and interest rates

A.) Great Lakes - $67,000.00 @ 9.500%
payment = $740 /mo

B.) Navient - $38,700.00 @ 10.500%
payment = $330 /mo

C.) Wells Fargo - $62,000.00 @ 8.240%
payment = $650 /mo

D.) Federal Loan (NELNET) - $30,678.72 @ 5.000% 
payment = $300 /mo


Total I pay each month is roughly $2,020.00. This accounts for +50% of my monthly take-home after taxes.

How can I get this to be lower so I can afford to survive and pay rent/build a savings? 
Otherwise it's back to working 2 jobs, which I honestly don't mind since I'm still 25.

Before anyone says anything, I have not yet played WWE 13 or 2K15. I'm going off of what I know so far. The previous games have WWE Universe mode, which, as the games progressed, have gotten more and more customizable. This is good, but I know I can't be the only one that would enjoy creating a brand or federation (like picking a team in Dynasty or Franchise) and being able to pick from a pool of pre-made rookie superstars (just like you recruit prospects in the college games and college draftees in Madden).

Clearly income tax for federal and state (Georgia). Then I guess Medicare, Social Security, and maybe some other things. 

20% should go into the 401(k), an IRA, and savings/emergency fund (I assume the emergency fund should take the full 20% until it's built up). I've also read that the 401(k) is taken out before taxes, so should I look at my income as if I'm making less than what I really am? Also, I can enroll in the 401(k) plan after 90 days of working there (which starts June 1). Should I save the money I would put into the account and then make a large deposit when I get enrolled?

30% should be used for the phone, netflix, internet, non-grocery foods, and shopping.

personalfinance,"Sell rapidly appreciating accidental rental home to pay down student loans, or keep it as an income property?","I bought a house in a rapidly appreciating neighborhood in Feb. 2014. Current mortgage is 4.5% on $344K. Total payment with PMI is $2225/month. Was planning to live in the house but had to quickly leave the country for work (doubled my pay) and have been renting it to family (at a loss) while I decide what to do with it. The question now is whether to sell it or rent it out.

Here are the facts:

* Salary $305K, year-end bonus likely to be in the neighborhood of $40K, salary next year $330K. 

* Sole breadwinner, spouse stays home, have a 2-year-old and a baby due in June. We live abroad and would like to send our children to private school, which will cost $2K/month/child, starting next year for our oldest.

* Student loan at 5.25%, principal $143,000, monthly payment $1850. Would put 100% of my profit into this loan if I sold the house.

* Credit score 800+, pay off credit cards in full every month, no other debt.

* Currently renting abroad for $3200/month.

* Bought house for $370K. Zillow tells me it's now worth as much as $460K. Zillow is relatively accurate for my area, and there is NOTHING comparable on the market in my neighborhood/zip right now. Every other home with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 baths is listed at $480K or higher. Likely to continue appreciating rapidly within the next five years, as my neighborhood is still technically ""transitional"" (some cheaper/older properties yet to be flipped) and a lot of nearby commercial/retail redevelopment is currently underway.

If I rented it out, I could probably get $2,000 to $2,300, so it's possible it would be cash-flow negative without a refi. At the very least, it's not likely that it would net me a whole lot for the time being, especially because I would need to hire a management company to deal with tenants and upkeep. I'm over 20% equity if Zillow is accurate, so it's not inconceivable that I could refi to drop PMI and lock in a lower interest rate and monthly payment, but it would be a gamble with the appraisal money because it's possible that Zillow is overestimating the value, and I'd have to come up with closing costs (although maybe I could just keep my current interest rate and forgo most of the costs, since rates are pretty low right now). Not eligible to do the appraisal and drop PMI through my current lender without a refi until next February (would only be able to do so if I had 75% LTV, which is a stretch, and if I had made significant improvements, which I haven't and don't plan to).

Should I hold, refi or drop PMI sometime in the next year, let it keep appreciating, and treat it as my first real estate investment? My current projections have me paying off my student loan at the end of 2016 (if I don't pay for private school) or mid-2017 (if I do).

Or should I sell now, throw the profits at my student loan, and then be able to pay off the rest of the student loan by the end of this year, so that I suddenly have massive amounts of disposable income starting in 2016? I could use some of that money to pay for private school, and I could quickly get back into real estate investing at that point, but with the advantage of being able to select my property/ies with a view to investment and better cash flow.",finance,1428473372

* Today's policy decision was not unanimous but was kept unchanged over 8-1 votes. 

* Member Mr. Kiuchi once again voted against. His proposal was to reduction in purchase so that base rises at ¥45 trillion per annum.

* BOJ notes steady pace of private consumption that has been boosting GDP growth, while household sector in Japan remain weak, especially after consumption tax hike last year.
* BOJ expects CPI to hover around 0% for the time being. It means lower inflation will not be a guide to BOJ policies in future for the time being.
* BOJ will keep the purchase in line with previous guidance and will keep the average maturity at 7-10 years.

* Annual pace of purchase of ETFs and REITs will be about ¥ 3 trillion and ¥ 90 billion respectively.

* There will be no changes regarding commercial paper and corporate bonds and their size will be maintained at current ¥ 2.2 trillion and ¥ 3.2 trillion respectively.


BOJ running out of options -

* Liquidity concerns in JGB market is weighing on BOJ decisions. BOJ originally started purchasing assets to reach 2% inflation target in next 2 years, however deadline was dropped in later meetings.

* From inflationary point, BOJ policy seems to have failed so far and it is not clear whether further action to buy government bonds would do any better.

* However, it might still reach target and increase the pace of purchase without causing liquidity issues by moving into other asset class like municipal bonds, corporate bonds or equities.

Impact -

* Yen strengthened after the policy release, traded 119.7 against dollar. However lost grounds currently trading at 119.9.

* Today's FOMC minutes will provide guidance ahead.

I am totally okay with doing the odd stretch of contract work or some part time work after 35, but don't want to NEED to.

We are currently aggressively putting extra toward student loans.

I bought a house through FHA for 100k a couple years ago with 5% down, meaning I have approximately $100 each month going toward PMI. My property taxes, homeowner insurance, and PMI are rolled into the monthly mortgage cost with a 3.25% interest. 

My house is a double, which I pull about $650 a month on

I have about 10k worth of student loans remaining at an average of 5.25% and my SO has about 18k left at 6.8%.
I have about 10k left on my car with 0% interest.
My wife has 18k left on her car with 3.25% interest.

Employer will match 50% up to 6% of salary, which is currently 95k, but with bonuses, I should be above 100k.

personalfinance,I have an auto loan with an atrocious APR. Navy Federal Credit Union won't refinance. Are there reasonable options to avoid all that interest?,"Ok, first, I am near middle age, but I am very new to grown-up finances and not at all knowledgable about loans. 

I got an auto loan at 17.19% APR from Navy Federal in July 2011. 6 years was the only way the payments seemed affordable, so it is a 6 year loan. I knew at the time it was a crazy interest rate, but I was desperate, and with poor credit, it was the best I could find. I don't know what my credit score was at that time, but I was just then paying off the delinquent accounts on my credit report, so it had to be bad.

At this point, I owe about $4400.

Anyway, now my FICO score is 757, so I thought I would be able to refinance my loan for a better APR. But Navy Federal says they won't do it unless there has been some sort of hardship. 

Am I stuck with a stupid interest rate? I know I signed up for it, but I did (however ignorantly) assume I would be able to refinance once my credit improved.

I recently created an account at CreditKarma.com, but when I entered the variables of my NFCU loan, APR, how long was left on it, etc., it said there were no options to fit my needs.

Does anyone have any helpful input, please? I can increase my payments, but not more than double.

I forgot to ask Navy Federal, so I will ask here - is it typical for there to be penalties for paying off an auto loan early?

I do want to say: I am so inexperienced at this, I don't know if it is just a simple matter of applying to other banks for a loan, and then using that to pay off my NFCU loan. Is that a thing?

personalfinance,Ruined my parents finances and retirement because of student loans. Please help!,"I have been looking at a lot of posts about student loans, but haven't seen any that really relate to my particular mess.
 
I am about to graduate in May with an MLA from a private college (and have a useless BA in Anthropology from a state university). 

As it stands I owe roughly $63,000 in student loans (could not receive financial help from family or grants), with most of the loans having a 6.8% interest rate (the lowest is 3.2 on $1,500).
 All the loans are owned by the same company. I have a low paying hourly job (lost my $35,000 a year salary job in October due to city budget cuts), and my monthly bills are around $450 including groceries. 

I know that I am incredibly lucky that my living expenses are cheap, as my boyfriend or ""mortgage partner"" as I call him pays the mortgage and car payments. However he had terrible credit (that he has managed to drastically fix in the last two years), and so the mortgage is in my name, and my car is in both of our names (also he never went to college and thankfully doesn't have any loans) We filed taxes jointly the past two years. I know that my payments are going to be crazy high and that I need a higher paying job, but the job market is disgustingly barren where I live (the south enough said).I do not want to depend on my boyfriend for help because it is my mess that I have gotten myself into. But that's not my main issue (although help on any type of consolidation would be appreciated). 


Over the years, I have had to take loans out in my mom's name as the Direct Plus Loans. She owes $36,000 all of which have 7.8% interest and have accrued $7,000 in interest alone since 2009. She is 65, unemployed (due to various reasons), and is at this point receiving social security. She and my father divorced but stayed living together (don't ask). My father is 66, living on disability. They have recently decided to get remarried so that if anything were to happen to him, she could at least receive his retirement disabilities (which will kick in when he turns 67). On her own, being unemployed, I know her payments would be low (and I would be sending money to pay them), but now that they want to get remarried I am terrified that the payments will go up to something astronomical (even though they live off of $2,200 a month, and roughly $3,000 when his retirement kicks in).


 I feel like I have literally ruined my mother's life and her finances that she has worked so hard for her entire life, all in the name of two useless degrees. At this point in her life she simply cannot go back to work. They are not upset at me about the whole thing, because I am the first one in my family to go to college let alone get a Masters Degree. They have worked themselves to the bone their entire lives just to make ends meet and thought they had finally reached a level of comfort when they retired, and I feel like I have completely ruined it. These loans will all kick in as soon as I graduate in less than a month because I have already used my grace period when I had to drop out a few years ago. I don't know what kind of specific help I am looking for, but any words of wisdom or strategies would be so much appreciated. I am in a full blown panic and honestly feel completely lost.

personalfinance,I have 3 options and I don't know what to do.,"Hi Reddit, 


I consider myself a decision maker but I am in waters I am unfamiliar with that have long term implications. I will lay out the details and my options.

Debt:

1)	Home 37 years old (Colorado Denver metro area)

a.	188,133 left on the loan | purchases @ $204,000

b.	Payment is 998 a month w/ tax and insurance $1,198

c.	Interest rate is 3.89%

d.	VA loan

e.	Current market value $242,000 – believe we could get about 236k for it

f.	About $5,000 worth or work to get it ready for sale

2)	Boat 2013 20ft ski/fish

a.	$28,000 left on the loan

b.	Payment is $365

c.	Interest rate 9.95%

3)	Car 2011 Nissan 

a.	$13,878 left on the loan

b.	Payment is $585 a month

c.	Interest rate 0.9%

4)	Credit card dept

a.	$4500

b.	Interest 18%

5)	Personal income

a.	Me $85,000

b.	Her $45,000

c.	We both claim 0 married for taxes

d.	Total net monthly take home is $7,000

I think that covers my liabilities and income. Long story short my friend/boss is getting a new house built. We checked it out and have new house fever. So here are our options

1)	New home and sell this one. We apply all of the money we get to the new house. House payment now $1600-1800, 10 year warranty, 20 years on the roof, a 20% discount on electricity due to solar, and 10-15% upgrade on space. New affluent area but will cause us to move out of the best school district in the state. We have a 15 year old. 

2)	Take a refinance on the home with the following terms – Pay off car and credit cards and put the rest away for retirement, increased equity payments, rainy day fund etc 

a.	47,000 cash in hand

b.	New loan amount 235,000

c.	New payment amount $1026

d.	New interest rate 3.2%

3)	Do nothing and tweak our budgets to put more money at the loan for the house. We can have the house paid off in 8 years and are currently projected to pay off the house in 13 years due to $400 a month extra we put to principle. We would increase it to $900 a month to get the loan paid even sooner.


Well reddit what do you think based on what’s given? My wife and I are leaning toward either do nothing or take the refinance. Thank you in advance for any input.

Edit for formatting

EDIT:2

Thanks for all the input. Looks like option 3 is the route we will take. Going to hit the credit card hard rework the budget then get the boat payed off while increasing the amount to principle. After that in a few years we can take a loot at it all again. We will be empty nesters at that point.

personalfinance,Taking out a loan to start a business?,"I've been toying with the idea of owning my own business for a very long time, it's something I want to do however quitting a job to start a business is inherently risky.  Thus why I have done it yet, however I am getting more and more disgruntled with my corporate job by the day.  I'm a planner, I like to get all of my ducks in a row and research all angles before making a move but one thing I'm not fully experienced in is funding an operation like this.  

The specifics:  I want to start a baking business; work out of commercial kitchens and catering spaces with the end goal of owning a storefront.  I have the background needed to do the job and I've helped get a number of small businesses (cafes) opened and off the ground.  I have a number of resources I can draw on for advice etc so I'm not worried about that.  I live in NJ so no cottage food industry allowed, you have to rent space in a commercial kitchen.  No problem, there are a million.  

Current Finances:
Take home after taxes, 401K, health insurance: $3160/month
Savings: $4000

Expenses:
Rent: FREE
Car: Owned, no payments
Car Insurance: $110/month
Renter's Insurance: $10/month
Storage Space: $78/month
Food: $400-$600/month
Other: 
Gas, shopping, etc.

Anticipated Expenses for start up:
LLC, state and local forms: $1000.00 (this is exaggerated, what I have found so far is that this will end up being closer to half this)
Caterer's insurance: $800-$1,100/year
ServSafe Cert books &amp; Class: $200
Work space/Kitchen: Varies.  Spaces can be rented by the hour, week, month, etc.  My plan is to start with as needed to get the business going and go whole hog and rent by the month.  
Marketing materials (business cards, advertising, branding): ~$600 to start
Supplies: As needed.  This will depend on what my volume is and what distributor I can order from.  Likely I'll go with Sysco although I believe they have a $500 minimum per order and I'm not sure of the logistics of having it delivered to a shared commercial kitchen.

All in all we're looking at about $5,000 potential start up expenses on the high end.  

The question: has anyone taken out a loan to start a business?

* Student loans are all deferred at the moment as I started grad school this year. Will graduate in December of 2016 with at least three more semester of debit. (~$32,000)


**Plan of Attack**
For my summer semester of classes I plan to take out a private school loan that will be large enough to pay for my semester of classes as well as the $3k credit card and $5.5k private loan debit that I have moving it all into a lower interest rate of 4.74%. From there I will have ~$450/month to be able to start putting towards the smaller school loans I have and use the snowball method by starting with the smaller loans but also the ones with the higher interest rates. I am the kind of person who will feel very rewarded by seeing some of those smaller loans completely paid off quickly.  I have also started trimming back on all of the little unnecessary expenses that I have (expensive cable, eating out, cell phone plan, spotify/Pandora/gaming subscriptions) to up the amount I am able to put towards payments each month. The credit card has already been placed in the freezer!

I've installed YNAB and am really hoping that by the time I graduate with my Masters in 2016 I will have my budget under control and a good chunk of my undergraduate loans paid off. Comments, advice and suggestions are all welcome!

personalfinance,I'm 22 and graduate in May. I have already accepted a job in a new state. How to move forward from here?,"Hello PF

I graduate in May with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and have accepted a job in Washington as a federal employee for the Navy. I have had an internship with the Air Force throughout part of school so I have a pretty good idea of the benefits and such. This will be my first time living completely alone and in a new state that I have spent a total of 4 days in so to say I'm nervous is an understatement. 

Starting pay for the job is 55k/year. Plus an 8k signing bonus which should be around 5k after taxes I think. I have selected and apartment with rent at $900/month without utilities. This area is much more expensive than I'm used to in NM. The Navy will pay for the move up there but I will be purchasing all my furniture when I get up there. I plan on investing in a nice bed and looking at a thrift store for other items.

Following the 1/3rd rule I expect to make ~2600/mo.

Known monthly expenses

* Rent: $900

* Utilities: ~$130

* Car Payment: $300 (it's actually $250 but at 60 months and 2.9% I want to get it payed off closer to 2-3 years) $12,800 remain on the car and I plan on using most of my bonus to get this value lower.

I currently have 0 credit card debt and pay off my bill in full monthly.

While an intern I contributed 5% to the TSP to maximize the advantage there. Now I would like to contribute more since I am starting my career and was thinking 10-15%.

I am unsure about my food, gas, and fun (beer, I can't wait to explore all the breweries in the area!) expenses since it will be a totally new place for me but does this look like a sustainable lifestyle for what I will be making?

I took out student loans in Canada for grad school in the United States. . . taking out those loans when the CAD and USD were at parity. I have about $130,000 CAD outstanding on it with a variable interest rate of 3.85% capped at 8%, and have an income approximately equal to that outstanding balance (but in USD).

Now that the USD is worth approximately $1.25 CAD, I looked into refinancing my loans partially in order to hedge the exchange rate. I was offered $50,000 USD at 5% fixed, or 3.2% variable capped at 9%. This would leave me with a USD loan of $50,000, and a CAD loan of $72,000, wiping out about $10,000 due to the exchange.

Do you think it's worth doing this? If so, and if I have an expected repayment timetable of 3 years on the $50,000 loan, should I go fixed at 5% or variable at 3.2%?

personalfinance,Purchase vs Lease for residential solar,"I am entertaining having solar panels installed on my roof but there are multiple options: 

**$25k for a 10KW system - Purchase**. ($17.5k after 30% Federal Tax Credit.)

vs

**$0.123/kWh Power Purchase Agreement(PPA)**. System costs me nothing and I just purchase the power from the solar company for about 5 cents less a kWh than I currently pay the utility company.

The 10KW system would cover about 40% of my yearly usage for about a $1800 a year savings at the current $0.18/kWh cost. 

Current SREC (Solar Renewable Energy Credit) prices in NJ trade around $185. So electric savings and my 10 SRECs yield about $3,600 a year, which is about a 5-6 year break even. The PPA would immediately save about $600 a year with no investment. 

To add even more to the options, the Utility company offers a Solar Loan that would make the system cost me about $7k after the tax credit, but they keep my SRECs. So about a 4 year break even.

**Total Savings at Year 6:**

PPA: $2,900

Purchase Option: $2,200

Purchase w/ Utility Company Loan: **$3,200**

**Total Savings at Year 10:**

PPA: $5,100

Purchase Option: **$16,000**

Purchase w/ Utility Company Loan: $11,100

financialindependence,How much Tax would you pay to avoid being Overexposed to the market when you're elderly?,"I've been lurking for some time, had to switch names to concentrate on financial jazz.  Thanks to this sub for providing balanced suggestions and recognizing different situations and the effort required to be FI. 

Here's my question.  Would you pay $10k or more in taxes ""just"" to balance investments when you are, say, 83? 

I manage my mother's assets.  She is 83 and in long term care.   She considered herself an investor, had house rentals and had a brokerage account.  Her philosophy was large-cap, dividend paying stocks, always and only.  When I took over in 2009 she had $450k invested this way:

* 85% in stocks, 
* 10% in stock funds,
* 5% cash
* Small monthly income from rentals 
* No bonds, munis, CDs, index funds
* No tax deferred account of any kind.

So basically one account, all stocks, taxable account, $450k.  Fast forward a few years. She made gains like most everyone between 2008 and now. I moved some assets, just enough to max out limits but avoid taxes most years. The houses had to go.  She is now:

* 45% stocks
* 20% index funds
* 13% bonds
* 10% stock funds
* 6% income fund
* 6% cash

Now worth $800k.   

She has enough in capital gains that if they all sold, it would rack up a bill of $40k for Fed only, and we're in a state that would tax it too.  I haven't been willing to do that. 

Would you rebalance and take a tax hit?  Would you keep moving some but avoid taxes?  How much in taxes might you be willing to absorb to get more conservative?",finance,1428528797
financialindependence,Are there strategies for FI catered more toward contract workers who don't have the 401(k) option?,"First, what a great sub. I've learned so much over the past few months just by lurking here every day. 

I see a lot of advice around here centered on tax-advantaged accounts using company-backed retirement vehicles. I would like to get some advice for people who don't have that option because they work for companies who do not offer those benefits (notably staffing agencies). Here is my situation:

* 26 years old, mechanical engineer, just started working for the department of energy through a contracting agency (W-2 worker).
* ~$76.000/yr (hourly) with no benefits aside from 10 days PTO and paid federal holidays.
* No debt.
* Roth IRA using leveraged index: ~$23k (maxed every year)
* Savings account: ~$23k (I keep $15k as my emergency fund, explained below).
* ~60% savings rate, post-tax. 

You may be wondering why I don't have more saved up with that sort of salary. After college, I spent about 2 years traveling around in different areas of the world. I got two shorter-term engineering jobs to fund these travels and traveled frugally and to non-touristic places to be able to get my money's worth. It was well worth it and, to be honest, I yearn for that sort of lifestyle again. Although I am trying to be disciplined about staying at this job for many years, you never know what kind of opportunity will come up, which is why I keep a slightly more substantial ""emergency fund.""

With that said, I love the idea of things like the Roth conversion ladder or backdoor Roth as a means to withdraw enough to live on, tax-free, once FI is reached. Unfortunately, these methods are geared toward people who have 401(k)s through their employer and can make those conversions, which I don't. 

I don't particularly have an FI goal in mind. Rather, I would like to use the principles of FI to guide my savings (and I think I've always been frugal to begin with).

My question, in essence, is how do I structure my savings strategy knowing the fact that I don't have access to a 401(k). Do I have any other options aside from taxable accounts if I would like to keep things on the passive side of stock market investing? What would you do in my position?

*91,974 home loan at 4.99% @ 905 a month (paid every two weeks at 452.50) {around 22 years left give or take}

*3,700 home improvement loan at 16% @ 138.40 a month. {2 1/2 years left on loan}


The house is worth around 111-112k as per the most recent appraisal. 


Edit to add: my 401k is about $4k, but we borrowed about $1k already a few months ago for an emergency and we'd rather pay that back at some point than borrow more. I forgot that before because it automatically comes out of my paycheck.
Of course we'd also like to add an emergency fund/ savings for the future but right now we just need to pay something off to improve things.


I received an offer in the mail from a company called embrace home loans who are offering a consolidation loan up to 271,000 (i assume up to or around the value of the house) at 3.125% (3.9 apr) fixed rate loan that can be used to pay off other debts.

As of right now I earn around 2150 after taxes, insurance, and 401k with bills coming to around 2100 give or take depending on electricity.


I am married and my SO is currently not working but is looking for a job.


My question is would it be smart or beneficial to roll some or all of the above loans into this consolidation option to save on interest. I would like to set the loan for 30 years and pay whatever the new balance would be every two weeks like I do now and put any difference saved directly back into principle payments. That of course is assuming the overall bill comes to less than 1394 which is the current total of all loan payments. I.E the new bill is 1100 a month and I put 294+ directly into principle each month. 
Or should I keep all my current loans as they are, as everything stands I am unable to put very much if any extra principle towards any loan. Sometimes I can spare 20ish.


If my SO can find a job anything extra earned can go directly into the potential new loan or any of the current existing loans. If it matters my credit score is around 695-700 and will most likely take a hit by getting a new loan from average age decreasing and whatever hits it takes by getting the score pulled.

I will be working for a company a starting salary of 70k/year with huge opportunities to make overtime pay, which due to the nature of the field, is 2x hourly wage. This is what I've been thinking about mostly:

-As of now I'm thinking it would be best to rent a place rather than purchase (about 10k in the bank) as I will not build much equity in a home that I don't plan on living in for too long. Correct me if I'm wrong about that though. Rent would probably end up being about 1200-1250/month.

-I also have almost no credit history and I'm thinking that if I work through to December (I start June 8th) I would be able to put a large down payment on a car which would offset poor interest rates which I might be stuck with. Car payments might help build my credit rating over the next few years while I save up and decide where to buy a home.

-In the meanwhile use my new credit card I just received to pay all monthly bills like phone, internet, cable etc. to start building my score. (1K limit)

My last concern is about the remaining money I will have saved up. The concern is I really don't have much of a clue as to where to put it. I would like to start saving as much and as soon as possible.

personalfinance,Help Needed- College Student in Deep Trouble,"I'll start by saying I made a throwaway for this because I'd rather not have a lot of people find about this. No one except for my two closest friends know about this, not even my family. 


I am a 20 year old Junior in college attending a state school in the midwest. I'll be graduating the fall of 2016 with a marketing major along international business and business administration minors. 

I currently have a serious problem: Debt.

About a year ago I got into some trouble while being stupid on a weekend night after a couple drinks. This resulted in me having to pay damages immediately if I wanted to avoid any further consequences. To pay this, I used money left over from financial aid along with opening two credit lines. This obviously made it tough on the future me, which is where I am at today. I'll just list everything from now on to avoid writing an essay.

-No money left in checking/savings accounts.

-Credit Card #1= $1,105 Balance @ 9.5% ($1,200 Limit)

-Credit Card #2= $1,187.25 Balance @ 13.5% ($1,200 Limit)

-I'm making minimum payments every month on both cards to avoid going over the limit.

-$10,200 in Federal Student Loans

-$31,222 in Private Student Loans

-No payments on student loans until 6 mo. after I graduate.

-Rent= $400/month after utilities. (6 Roommates)

-I'm two months behind on rent.

-Just started a part-time job which will get me about $600/month until I can work full time in the summer.

-If I work part time in the summer I can go to summer school full time and receive another Financial Aid disbursement. Only negative about this is it wouldn't be for another two months and it would just add onto the amount that I have to pay after graduating. 

-Receiving help from parents or other relatives is not an option.

-Staying in school is my main priority. (3.6 gpa w/ Dean's list honors)

The reason I made this post is because I simply don't have enough money so I am wondering if I have any other options such as loans with deferred payments, or if my luck has run out and I have no other options.

If you have any ideas that would allow me to catch up on payments without completely ruining my credit, I would greatly appreciate it!

Thank you for your time.",finance,1428536219
personalfinance,"Emergency Fund vs Personal Line of Credit, what's /r/personalfinance's stance?","In the case of emergency a personal line of credit can be advanced upon from most banks in the form of cash and interest rates currently go from prime + 1% to prime + 7% on average unsecured. 


What is /r/personalfinance's take on having a line open at all times worth 6-9 months of one's salary and instead of contributing those same funds to a liquid low interest savings account, instead invest more into retirement(preferably a roth so that principal can be withdrawn if needed to pay down line if used)? Given that we expect emergencies to hopefully not pop up too often, would this be a viable option? Why or why not?


My take is straight down the middle since I have both an emergency fund and a PLOC. So I am genuinely interested on everyone's thoughts are on this idea. I will discuss my reasons when I get more time and if someone has a similar financial plan as I do.",finance,1428536577

For the whole first month I was being paid was under the impression I had an overdraft (I think because my student friends did I believed I did too)  I made about 30 transactions over zero and was subsequently charged for every single one of them. I ended up with I think £600 in charges. Once I got the letter through the door I obviously stopped.

Another blunder I made was opening a credit card when I had no money for Christmas presents. 18 year old me obviously didn't keep up with payments and I was defaulted. 

I was stuck in a payday loan cycle that  took about a year to break, I finally paid off the bank via a collection agency and I settled my outstanding bill with my credit card. Its been over 2 years since I missed any sort of payment. I have 2 phone bills that I pay off, one is for my mother. I have a laptop which I pay for via an online catalogue, and I also have a credit card again, purely for in the interest of trying to build my score again.

I tried to swap banks the other day and applied for a Barclay's account, I was denied. I earn good money, better than most and I can't even open a bank account. I'm starting to freak out. What am I going to do when I want some finance or a mortgage. Im saving for a house at the moment but I'm scared that the banks will even give me a mortgage.

I have been checking my credit report via experian and Equifax, although both have ran out and I havnt decided to pay for the full version. I use noddle to keep track every now and then. Its quite disheartening when I check  though as I havnt seen a change at all every since I start monitoring.

The only positive I've had is that my Cc company raised my limit after a while, which I assume is a good thing for my report.

How long before I start to see things moving in the right direction? Am I being too ambitious to expect to start shopping for a mortgage by next  Christmas?

I've read a lot of things about boosting credit reports, is there anyone else who has climbed out of a hole before and can recommend anything that works?

Also would I have more luck if I was to apply for a bank account in person? I feel I by applying online I would trigger too many red flags. I would be swapping over all my works payments into the new bank.

I currently have 10k saved for a car purchase and I'm looking at slightly used cars (4 or 5 years old) in the ~15k range. With a used car of course comes the state sales tax (9.2% for Kansas I believe), the interest rate (~5%) and the term length (60 months) and insurance of $60 a month.


I have also looked at new cars (2014) that are around the ~20k price range. The one main difference that I noted between the used car and new car was the 0% APR or interest rate for the length of the term (60 months). With that said my insurance would also jump up to ~100 a month. Of course they also through in a bunch of free oil changes and stuff like that for the first year or two that you own the vehicle.

personalfinance,"Over $100,000 of debt in 2012, will be Debt Free in 2015","I am a 30 year old college graduate with a decent paying job that I have been at since 2008.  I met my wife while at school, bought a house and moved in together.  

In 2012 we began to take a serious look at our finances.  We weren't necessarily struggling, but we certainly weren't getting ahead.  The bank account never really grew.  

In April of 2012, we made a decision together that it was time to make some changes.  We started tracking every dollar spent.  Each month we sat down for a few hours and allocated every expense somewhere.  We would then make a plan for the following month of where the money was going to go.  

After tracking our spending, we were able to see how much more we could put towards our debt.  We had multiple student loans, a few credit card balances, a furniture payment and 2 car payments.  The loans totaled over $100,000.

We organized the loans by interest rate and started putting any extra money from that month towards the highest interest rate.  It was a wonderful feeling after the first loan was paid off!

We then took the extra money each month plus what we were already paying towards the first loan and applied it to the next highest interest rate.  This is called the ""Debt Snowball"" tactic.  Once you pay off the first few loans, the amount of money being applied towards the next loan is much larger than the minimum payment.  This allows you to pay off the loan a lot quicker than if you continued to pay the minimum payment each month.  

At the current rate of paying down our debt, we are scheduled to be debt free in October of this year.  If we hadn’t changed any of our payments, we wouldn’t be out of debt until January, **2027!!**

Being debt free is possible.  You can still live a good life and have some fun while also knowing you are doing the right thing and becoming more financially independent.  

Hopefully my story will help you start the journey yourself.  Let me know if you have any questions!

WOW!  Thanks for all the comments!

I will share my income, which was an important part I left out and apologize for.

I started making $52,000 in 2008.  My wife started making $50,000 around 2010.  Small cost of living adjustments each year, except for the new job assignment I applied for and received in 2012 with a new income of $72,000.

Most of each year's tax refunds went towards the debt, as well as any bonus from work.  The bonuses were small and only received for 2 years.  

Everybody has different amounts of income.  Yes, it certainly does help my wife and I are a duel income family.  I am hoping that my success story motivates someone out there to start putting just a little more money towards their debt payments, no matter how small.  We started with only $200 more a month towards the loans but every bit helps.  

If my generation continues to follow ""what is normal"" and just pay the minimum due for 20 years, we are going to be out of student loan debt at 45 years old with an extremely small amount of money saved and have to work until we are 75, or can't continue to work physically.  

I refuse to follow that path.

stocks,FOMC rates and market reaction,"The minutes were not as dovish as market pricing after the March meeting, or pricing going into the release of the minutes, would suggest. 

The FOMC believes that the weakness in 1Q growth has been largely due to transitory forces, and doesn't need to see signs of pickup in PCE or wage inflation to bolster confidence about the inflation outlook.

BofA Merrill Lynch says they continue to be positioned short in the front end as they expect growth data to rebound in coming months. There was some clarification about the exit strategy as well: the Fed formalized their base case, which is to maintain a 25bp fed funds target range with IOER on the top and the ON RRP rate on the bottom.

The Fed is willing to increase the capacity of the RRP program during the initial stages of liftoff, but today's minutes indicated that the Fed intends to shrink the facility fairly soon afterward. 

One way to do this would be to raise IOER above the fed funds target range, widening the IOER-RRP spread beyond 25bp. Another idea officials discussed is to sell short term Treasuries, thereby permanently draining excess reserves by accelerating the normalization of the balance sheet.This would reduce the reliance on the ON RRP facility and tighten the link between the effective fed funds rate and IOER.

Premise: I'm 26 (just turned this month. I was 25 on Jan 1 2015.) I'm a senior in college (I took time off before college to work.)

My parents live in another state, didn't / do not contribute to my college costs, and I live with them the summer of 11-12 and 12-13. I've claimed myself as a 1 exemption for... quite a few years now, definitely through college. 

Looking story short (and one I don't fully understand) their tax situation is royally effed up. Regardless, I think their accountant has it under control now. Anyway, at his suggestion, they're now pushing me to retroactively ammend (at least) my 13 and 14 taxes as a 0 exemption, where they'll roll me up as a dependant, along with my 1098 student loan stuff, etc, and something something something they'll have 4 dependents vs 3, and they'll get  a much larger refund. 

I haven't talked to their accountant, nor do I know what to really ask. I pretty much am a basic Turbotax user with some summer job W2s and my 1098s. Pretty easy. 

My specific concerns: 

1) Is this legal? Does anyone face repercussions? 

2) Will I have to pay more? I'm (I guess?) fine with it if it means nothing really changes on my end, and they get more of a refund. 

3) I had the American Opportunity Tax credit as well (I believe both years.) Want to make sure this is okay. 


Basically, I don't fully trust their accountant, the whole thing seems a little weird to me, and I don't want to do something that really screws me over later. Thanks all.",finance,1428544361
financialindependence,"Best path to financial independence: sell rapidly appreciating accidental rental home to pay down student loans sooner, or keep it as an income property?","I bought a house in a rapidly appreciating neighborhood in Feb. 2014. Current mortgage is 4.5% on $344K. Total payment with PMI is $2225/month. Was planning to live in the house but had to quickly leave the country for work (doubled my pay) and have been renting it to family (at a loss) while I decide what to do with it. The question now is whether to sell it or rent it out.

Here are the facts:

*Salary $305K, year-end bonus likely to be in the neighborhood of $40K, salary next year $330K.

*Sole breadwinner, spouse stays home, have a 2-year-old and a baby due in June. We live abroad and would like to send our children to private school, which will cost $2K/month/child, starting next year for our oldest.

* Student loan at 5.25%, principal $143,000, monthly payment $1850. Would put 100% of my profit into this loan if I sold the house.

* Credit score 800+, pay off credit cards in full every month, no other debt.

* Currently renting abroad for $3200/month.

* Bought house for $370K. Zillow tells me it's now worth as much as $460K. Zillow is relatively accurate for my area, and there is NOTHING comparable on the market in my neighborhood/zip right now. Every other home with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 baths is listed at $480K or higher. Likely to continue appreciating rapidly within the next five years, as my neighborhood is still technically ""transitional"" (some cheaper/older properties yet to be flipped) and a lot of nearby commercial/retail redevelopment is currently underway.

If I rented it out, I could probably get $2,000 to $2,300, so it's possible it would be cash-flow negative without a refi. At the very least, it's not likely that it would net me a whole lot for the time being, especially because I would need to hire a management company to deal with tenants and upkeep. I'm over 20% equity if Zillow is accurate, so it's not inconceivable that I could refi to drop PMI and lock in a lower interest rate and monthly payment, but it would be a gamble with the appraisal money because it's possible that Zillow is overestimating the value, and I'd have to come up with closing costs (although maybe I could just keep my current interest rate and forgo most of the costs, since rates are pretty low right now). Not eligible to do the appraisal and drop PMI through my current lender without a refi until next February (would only be able to do so if I had 75% LTV, which is a stretch, and if I had made significant improvements, which I haven't and don't plan to).

Should I hold, refi or drop PMI sometime in the next year, let it keep appreciating, and treat it as my first real estate investment? My current projections have me paying off my student loan at the end of 2016 (if I don't pay for private school) or mid-2017 (if I do).

Or should I sell now, throw the profits at my student loan, and then be able to pay off the rest of the student loan by the end of this year, so that I suddenly have massive amounts of disposable income starting in 2016? I could use some of that money to pay for private school, and I could quickly get back into real estate investing at that point, but with the advantage of being able to select my property/ies with a view to investment and better cash flow.",finance,1428545891

* DMV notice is the first correspondence about this matter we've received since moving in September.

* Did not receive any forwarded mail from her old address about this.

* When moving her from Boston, the process involved packing everything she owns; She does not throw away important documents &amp; bills, they would have been filed. I did not see any excise notices then, and after digging through all of our files, didn't find anything either.

* Original bill was for $48.75.

* Collections amount is now showing as $118.57 !

What kind of recourse do I have? I'm hesitant to pay the collector because then her record will just be tarnished. We have plenty of money and if we had just received ANY semblance of correspondence in a timely manner, this would be a non-issue.

I am planning on calling the appropriate department tomorrow, but am not sure which one -- City Clerk? Treasury? Transportation Dept? There is no number on WWW.CITYOFBOSTON.GOV/EXCISE, only an email (OnlinePayments@cityofboston.gov).

If they cannot help me, how do I deal with the collector so that I can keep her credit intact?

investing,Understanding Structured Settlements,"Hopefully everyone is having a great weekend. Today I have the pleasure of co-hosting a $1000 giveaway! You may well have already seen posts from some other cohosts relating to Structured Settlements or selling annuity; if not, make sure you enter here!
What is a Structured Settlement?
When we hear the term structured settlement or ‘periodic payment’, the first thing that comes to mind is probably injury court cases; perhaps a win that results in a payout from an insurance company. Essentially, instead of winning damages as a lump sum, a more recent and popular outcome is to be awarded a structured settlement; a sum of money which is awarded in installments. This has a number of advantages for all parties involved. For the company/person paying the damages, they are not required to outlay all of the money immediately – the immediate outlay of capital could bankrupt or seriously affect their future business potential. For the recipient; there is less chance of being financially irresponsible and blowing all the cash!
 Structured Settlement

When Structured Settlements Don’t Work
Like anything else, one solution does not fit all. While regular payments sound sensible and perhaps a better all-round solution, sometimes people need the capital immediately:
Paying for College – Depending on the time of the settlement, it could be advantageous to have a lump sum of money to help pay for your children’s university. This may prevent them taking out expensive student loans, or perhaps enable them to go when they wouldn’t otherwise.
Getting out of Debt - If you are in some serious debt, perhaps it would make sense to use the compensation to clear these immediately. Not only would it relieve your stress and worries, but it would free up a lot of your monthly income. Consequently, the extra money would have the same effect as the monthly structured settlement payment.
Paying off Your House – Using a lump sum payment to obliterate your mortgage gives the same result as paying off debt – it frees up money each month to spend on other things. In effect, you are replacing the monthly structured payment with a reduced mortgage / living cost and getting some peace of mind thrown in for free!
 
The Alternative
If one of the above scenarios applies to you, perhaps it is worth trading annuity payments for a lump sum. There are several companies who are willing to purchase your structured settlement and in return pay you an immediate lump sum. Obviously there are fees involved, but these can often be offset by high-interest rates that you would no longer be subjected to!",finance,1428550256
personalfinance,Need a loan for 5th year at college without parental help,"Hi, I'm 22 and I really don't know anything about loans but I was hoping to explain my situation and get some feedback.

Previously my parents paid for my tuition and I paid for everything else (my apartment, food, entertainment etc). My parents won't pay for the extra semester I need to take (due to my own faults) and I'm going to need a loan to cover it. 

The cost of the semester is going to be $20,170. 

The good news is that I do have a job - a pretty solid one that I'm working part-time at. Its a tech-startup that I recently got stock options for (2%) and I'm paid $35/hr (I am basically treated as full-time but not paid with a salary). I have one credit card with a $5000 limit but barely anything in the bank (no savings) since I don't work enough really to save anything. This summer I'll be working full time which is great but I know I'm still going to need a loan even with budgeting. 

I had federal aid and loans before but I don't think I'm eligible now that I am going into my 5th year (I think I had issues with this last year too when I took some time off to intern elsewhere).

Assuming I graduate in the winter of this year (very likely) I would imagine paying off those loans wouldn't be too hard given my income. 

Budgetting for me right now is tough, I'm in a bad situation with my apartment (I ended up paying for two after one subletter canceled his lease) which has lead me to paying $1170/month for my apartment. In general I'm not a very frugal person either although that'll probably have to change this summer.

I'm trying to decide if I should do this or instead invest it over a longer time period and just let the debt grow with inflation and (hopefully) beat that with indexed funds / cash savings returns. I have no other debt but will soon re-skill and thus will have low income for at least all of 2016. I wouldn't need to use savings survive.

Is it really as simple as just working out my after-tax returns from whatever I invest in versus the inflation rate of the debt or am I missing something here? Even with an interest rate applied to the debt it would be capped at 6%.",finance,1428567718

finance,Credit facility vs commercial paper,"Hi all,

I am looking through 10-Ks of a few companies and looking at their short-term debt positions. I noticed that a general trend is to have one or more credit facilities but generally not use them. Instead, these companies use the commercial paper market for short-term liquidity. My question is why? Why have the credit facilities and not use them? Is there a general signalling issue, is this driven by interest rates, ease of issue, etc.? Any insight would be great.

investing,What Fundamentals Affect Commodity Prices Edit |,"In the previous post I explained the basics of commodity investing. In this post, I’m going to explain exactly what fundamental factors affect commodity prices.

A Precursor
Commodity prices tend to rise and fall together, much like how stock prices rise and fall together. As the saying goes, “a rising tide lifts all boats”. If the entire U.S. economy is doing well, generally all stocks will go up. The fundamentals below impact all commodity prices.

Inflation
Inflation is a huge factor that can impact commodity prices. Thanks to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, all commodities are officially listed in U.S. dollars. Here are two important terms that you need to know

Nominal value
Real value
The nominal value of a commodity is the “official price”. If gold per ounce is at $1300 right now, then the nominal value is $1300. If inflation is 100% (a hypothetical scenario), then the nominal value of gold will also increase by 100%, doubling to $2600 per ounce.

The real value of a commodity takes into account for inflation. Let’s assume that gold is at $1300 an ounce. If inflation increases by 100%, the nominal value will increase, but the real value is exactly the same. There’s just more U.S. dollars chasing after the same amount of gold in this world!

As investors, we only care about the nominal value. Thus, when inflation picks up, commodity prices soar across the board! This is what happened in Germany with hyperinflation in the 1930’s – a loaf of bread cost a bajillion Marks (Germany’s currency at the time) to buy. The real value didn’t change (a loaf of bread is still a loaf of bread), but the nominal value exploded.

This is what happened in the U.S. during the 1970s (although it wasn’t as severe as it was in Germany). U.S. inflation skyrocked (14% per year), and commodity price spiked in the 1970s. Gold went from $30 an ounce to $600 an ounce.

Right now, we are seeing the early phases of inflation where inflation will pick up but has not started yet. Ben Bernake (Chairman of the Federal Reserve) has a genius solution to America’s economic woes – print money! That’s essentially the name of the game for his consecutive rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE). Sooner or later, this money printing is going to catch up to him (or us American taxpayers, actually) with huge inflation. And what happens when inflation hits? Commodity prices skyrocket.

Increased Demand, Decreased Supply
There is a fixed amount of supply in this world – it’s not like we can manufacture gold (alchemy!) or copper. On the other hand, demand is increasing exponentially. Can you imagine if every person in the world lived the way us Americans did! Considering the amount of stuff we waste each year (that’s how my relatives from Europe put it), the world’s resources would be depleted in a heart beat.

With developing nations increasing their standards of living, the world’s demand for raw materials such as oil and copper is outstripping supply. The Chinese are a huge buying force in the world – they are rebuilding their country after:

1800s: Britain literally robs China of all its gold and silver by drugging the entire nation with Opium (prior to the 1800s, drugs didn’t exist in China). It’s called The Century of Humiliation. China went from #1 in the world (literally, the “Middle Kingdom”) to dead last.
Early 1900s: Chinese Civil War
1950 – 1978: the Communist fiasco (Chairman Mao ruined China).
So really, China’s literally been rebuilding its entire country over the past 30 years. And because China is so big (both geographically and population wise), China consumes a ton of resources.

This trend in increasing demand and shrinking supply is only going to continue, thereby pushing up commodity prices. Factor in some more inflation thanks to King Bernake from the Federal Reserve, and you have the perfect set up for a long term bull market in commodities.

personalfinance,~$150k in Student Loans. Am I doing this right?,"I graduated college May 2014 and already had a Software Engineering job lined up at large company. My parents didn't help with college because they couldn't even the school and government thought they could cover 50% of it somehow. So I had to take out Private Loans through Sallie Mae. Upon graduating, I got all of my loans consolidated through SoFI. Since 75% of the money was considered private loans I decided to pull the federal loans into the SoFI consolidation as well. The SoFI interest rate is much lower than the Sallie Mae loans but slightly higher than the federal ones. According to the Excel thing I had put together, I end up saving money by lumping everything together.

I currently use Mint to organize my budgets and finances. On top of my student loans I have 3 major monthly bills. My car payment, motorcycle payment, and rent (I live with my brother). These bills total $850. I have been paying $2k a month towards my student loans and putting more towards the one with the highest interest rate. I have budgets set up to save money for my yearly insurance payments. Budgets for my monthly gas, car parts, wedding (I am engaged), and a car for my fiance.


Here is a breakdown by the numbers per month:

* Fiance Car: $125

* Auto Insurance: $50

* My Car: $250

* Gas: $250

* Motorcycle Insurance: $25

* Motorcycle Payment: $100

* Service and Parts: $75

* Student Loan: $2,000

* Rent: $500

* Wedding: $125

* Clothing: $25

* Total: $3,525


After taxes and health insurance, this leaves me with an extra $200. I am also putting 6% into a 401(k) plan because that is the max that my company will match. The money that doesn't need to be accessed right away is sent to a separate high interest savings account to prevent me from being dumb.

Is there anything else that I can do to help pay my student loans off any sooner? What can I do to improve?

Thank you!!

personalfinance,"Reconciling ACA Premium Tax Credit, and getting married this year. Need advice.","Hey All, 

I'm having a problem with how my accountant reconciled my premium tax credits from the ACA. 

So I signed up for healthcare through healthcare.gov last Feb. I estimated my yearly income and was given a monthly credit toward healthcare like many others. Then in August I was married and eligible to be on my wife's healthcare plan through her employer. I notified healthcare.gov and told them I had another option through her insurance and no longer needed their assistance, they said no problem and immediately stopped my assistance. 
Then when doing my taxes our accountant filed us jointly, and on form 8962 he used out combined yearly income for the premium tax credits, which obviously was much higher that my income alone (and the amount I estimated when signing up for healthcare initially). So, the form indicated that I must pay back my tax credits, however the 8 months I was receiving the credit I was an individual and not receiving the majority of that joint income, and the moment I had another insurance option I cancelled my needed credits. 

Does anyone have any advice on this topic? Is there a way I can fill our form 8962 to correctly show only my earnings for the part of the year I received benefits? I'm not a tax expert or even novice, but if the IRS is going to assume that since I was married in Aug, then I must have had access to my wives income for the entire year leading up to that point, that is incorrect. On that same logic I should have had access to her health insurance plan for the entire year leading up to our marriage as well, which I obviously did not and the whole reason for needing the assistance through the ACA. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I got a best buy card to get a TV when I was 22 and was abysmal at remembering to pay the bill on time.  Lesson learned long ago.  All knocks against my credit are long since resolved.  

So I looked at getting a Serve card since I have only one reporting loan (Navient student loan), but did not activate it after reading further that it doesn't help build credit.

I see now that that wasn't really a rejection.  Anyway, fed up with the BS I plopped some money down on a secured card.  Now I have two BoA credit cards.

Since this is a PF subreddit, I think there needs to be stickied advice on methods for obtaining a college degree cheaply. Yes, it can be done, a lot of people have done it, and it's a very attractive option for many who don't want to spend $50,000 - $200,000 for a college degree in business and/or liberal arts. I specifically say these two as it's harder to test out of a science degree due to the nature of the courses, lack of popularity, and lab-based components of many of these. 

For a lot of people, all they need is a piece of paper saying they have a regionally accredited degree. With this you can get a well paying job through the federal or state governments. It's not Harvard mind you, but for the 99% of us that don't go to elite schools, these degrees are no different than any other no-name colleges. 

Charter Oak State College, Thomas Edison State College, and Excelsior College are 3 regionally accredited colleges that let you to test out of 99-100% of a college degree (typically in business, social sciences, or liberal studies). You can do other majors too but there are not many exams you can test out for those typically in science subjects. 

I think this is a vital source for students who are looking to get a degree on the cheap, and I think it could be something that is stickied.

I realized that I did not want to pursue a primary care career during the second half of my second year, so I left the program.

I graduated from my undergrad university in 2013. I struggled to find work while applying for med school so I didn't have any income to start paying off my loans. Deferred due to hardship. Finally, essentially a year later, I land a really nice starting job (approx $20/h, now $25/h). I had to reapply for med school (didn't get in the first time) so I was reapplying while working.

Success, I was accepted into med school. I wanted to start repaying my loans before it started, but my parents suggested I put it off again since med school was starting soon. I found out later that the underlying reason though is because when I had loans from undergrad, part of those loans were Parent PLUS loans. I already knew that, but the point is, if I started paying mine, they would have to start paying theirs as well, which they can't do right now (laid off, minimum wage, extraneous issues that I can't go into detail). This essentially means I would have to pay my loans... AND theirs. I come from a very close, traditional family so it's not as easy to just separate my finances from theirs.

This is kind of a hard situation for me at this point. Medical school starts in August (4 months from now, almost exactly). I want to start paying off some of these loans with the income I've accumulated, but is it worth doing it at this point with medical school starting soon? Med school loans are going to be insane as it is, it will just be another pile to add to the debt I have from undergrad. How should I approach this? Should I start at least paying off some of these undergrad loans (and... possibly have to start helping my parents with their loans for my education) or should I hold off since med school starts soon.

personalfinance,"Which loans should I pay off with incoming $21,000 bonus in September?","I have 1/4 of my RSU's vesting in September, based on current market conditions, that means $21,000 (post-taxes,) I have a choice to make now. There are several debts I'd like to pay off.



Loan | Balance | APY % | Min Payment
---|---|----|----
Personal Loan | $15,000 | 19% | $400
Personal Loan | $6,000 | 17% | $480
Car Loan | $8,000 | 2.99% | $260
Student Loan Subsidized | $4000 | 3.15% | $54
Student Loan Unsubsidized | $6000 | 7% | $84

Reducing my exposure to interest month-by-month, I should pay off both personal loans. This will free up $880 in my budget to pay towards the others. 

Another option would be to pay off 1 personal loan ($6000,) along with my car loan and the unsubsidized student loan (3 notes vs 2.) The monthly payment savings would be similar but less, $480+$260+84 = $820, which I can use towards the remaining personal loan and the remaining student loan. **With the added benefit that I would get my car's title, and could sell it for a cheaper car and use the remainder to help pay off the personal loan.** I know I can sell it without the title, but my bank doesn't have a branch near me (Navy Federal,) which means selling the car would be a bit of a pain without title-in-hand.

Anyone have any advice?",finance,1428602947
personalfinance,Not sure which loans to pay off first if they have the same interest rate.,"I have subsidized student loans that will start accruing interest in July.  

Overall there are a total of 30 student loans that were disbursed.  The highest is for $2800, but many are for very low amounts (e.g. several for $73 and several for $74). 

I understand that average account age is part of my credit score, but I'm not sure of the nuances of this.  I don't know if paying $500 to to completely pay off 9 loans is going to have a different impact on my credit than putting that $500 toward a single large loan.

Does it make a difference if I pay off all my low-value loans first so that I have less to keep track of, or should I pay down the largest loans first?

EXAMPLE:  If I have a loan for $74 and a loan for $2500, at the same interest rate, does it matter which one I put money toward?

I want to receive X dollars to cover these expenses and plan to roll the rest into an IRA. I'm trying to wrap my head around how to calculate how much I need to ask for so that I will actually receive X or close to it (but not less) after taxes and penalties are withheld. If I'm not mistaken the current 401k plan administrator will automatically withhold 20% for federal and 4% state tax amount I request as a distribution during the rollover. I think I also have to figure in a 10% penalty for early withdrawal as well? I'm sure it's really simple grade school level math but I keep coming up short on X because the more I add for taxes and penalties the more the taxes and penalties increase.

* No student loans from undergraduate (did music performance, thank God for scholarships/grants based off performing). 

* Went to graduate school and studied advertising; got a bit of scholarship money. Did internships/worked during this time. Graduated December 2015.

* Have 22K in student loans with a 5.410% interest rate. 

* Got my job in February 2015 in Boston. 40K salary with benefits. 

* Just signed up (literally yesterday) for a 2050 Retirement Fund.

* Currently living at a 3-bedroom paying $730 a month. In August I will be moving to another 3-bedroom paying $1133 a month (closer to my work, which is currently a 1 hour and 30 minute commute one way). 

**Moving home is not an option because...**

* Mom is crazy (traditional Chinese + extreme Baptist Christian). She doesn't work either but has a bit of disposable income. 

* Dad had a mid-life crisis, invested a lot of money into a restaurant with a ""friend"" who screwed him over, everyone got greedy, etc. He took out 300K+. My brother and I were not aware, my mom was but didn't want to tell us because ""you guys are too immature to understand."" 

* My mom has control of my money; this was because back then I was 16 and opening an account for the first time and had no idea WTF I was doing (I still am fairly confused/learning about how to better manage my accounts). I have an account in Virginia and an account here in Boston. My mom thus has been helping me save whatever money I have in this Virginia account. 

* I've tried asking her to give me full control of my accounts and money. She has said no. I have told her I'll take her off the accounts regardless but backed off because of various reasons (the biggest being guilt).

I've been becoming more and more depressed and feeling like I have no control over my life, especially because I feel I have no one I can turn to for advice for finances without feeling like they're going to try and screw me over (again, the whole greed thing really did a number on my family + family friends). 

Any and all advice is welcome.

1. Given the amounts involved here, I'm wondering if I should put down TurboTax and enlist the services of a professional? 

2. What kind of professional do I even need? I've heard so many different titles and barely know the difference between them. A CPA? An ""Enrolled Agent""? A financial planner? A fiduciary? A financial advisor?

4. How much should I expect to pay? Should I expect to pay extra given how close it is to tax day? Will anyone even be available?

(As best I can tell, the reason I owe so much is that when I sold some stock, my employer withheld way too little (25% federal, ~45% total) . I have no idea how this happened.)

personalfinance,"28y/M - Good job and salary, Just trying to tackle debt/savings goals while building better habits","Hey PF friends. Long-time lurker, here.  Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.  

I’ve spent the last 6-8 months getting my budget under control, and trying to get a plan together. This purpose of this post is two-fold: 1) seeking constructive criticism and (2) answers/suggestions to questions about specific problems I have identified. If you are interested, feel free to read on.   

The basics:  

28 years old, $57k Gross income, no kids. Spent most of my 20s financially illiterate, but managed to finish a Master's degree and land a job that pays well (with room for advancement).  
  
What I have:  
$8,250 in a 401k (employer matches 50 cents/dollar, up to 5%. I max it out.)  
$1,000 in an emergency savings account  
3 bed/1 br house, appraised at $140k  
SUV valued at $6,500 (KBB)

What I owe:  
$130k on the mortgage  
$88k in student loans (federal and private)  
$6k on my car loan  
$1,500 credit card debt  
  
On a monthly basis, this how everything shakes out…  
  
Expenses:  
$950 – mortgage  
$370 – car payment  
$125 – car insurance  
$40 – Internet  
$26 – Hulu/Netflix/Spotify  
$300 – Utilities (Gas/Electric/Water/Sewer/Trash)  
$50 – Phone  
$575 – Student Loan Payments  
  
Altogether, $2431 in monthly expenses  

Income:  
$1500/biweekly salary (x2 = $3k/month)  
$60 reimbursement from work  
$450 rental income (A friend rents a bedroom)  
  
Total income = $3510/month  

This leaves about $1079 per month ($269 per week) for gas, groceries and entertainment.  
  
Ideally, these are my goals, in order of priority:  
1) Pay off Credit Card  
2) Pay off Car  
3a) Start building savings (E-Fund goal = $7,500, General savings goal = $10k)  
3b) Chip away at Student Loans (smallest balance happens to have the highest rate, so I’d tackle that one first).  
4) Pay down mortgage  
  
At the end of this month, I’ll be getting a commission check, which I could use in addition to my emergency fund to pay off the credit card. Not sure if that's the best solution, but the option is there.  
  
If I just made minimum payments, it would take about 18 months to pay off the car loan. Obviously, I should probably start throwing everything I can at the car loan. Once that’s done, I plan on having the same approach with student loans.  
  
But I tend to struggle when it comes to managing my budget for week-to-week items, especially when it comes to eating out. I’ve tried several times to establish routines around meal prep, but have failed keep them consistent. I only spend about $30 per week on gas, so I feel like I need to address the $200 per week where I tend to spend on food, dining and everything else.  
  
That said, I have a few questions about how best to move forward:  
 1) Does the approach to paying down debt make sense? Any suggestions on how to make it better?  
 2) Is it worth it to use up my e-fund to pay off my credit card?  
 3) In your experience, what is a reasonable amount to budget each week for dining   out/entertainment?   
 4) How much can I realistically save by cooking more meals?  
 5) Would it be better to set a fixed amount aside to pay down debt, and which might “force” me to get  by on less?  
 6) How much would I realistically need to set aside to save/pay down debt to make significant progress?  
 7) Should I consider picking up side jobs to help meet my goals? Or do I have what it takes already, and just need better discipline?

Hi PF - I'd like to get your advice on refinancing an auto loan. I **purchased a new car in December of 2013 and took out a loan for $22.5k with an interest rate of 5.75%**. In retrospect, this was a bad decision because I did not negotiate at all (first-time car buyer).

I'm currently pursuing a bachelors for computer networking at a good school. I have no debts, and my tuition is 100% covered by a 529 account. Last year I made ~$7,000 working in the summer and December ($500 a week). And then another ~$3,000 this year ($200 a week). I have no current investments or even a 401K. I got a credit card back in November that I started using in place of my debit card since it's safer and I get decent cash back. I pay this off in full every month as a means to build my credit.




I was working part time until recently being laid off; so I have cut my spending to be less than $150 a month, but I was spending between $250-$350 a month mostly taking my girlfriend out to dinner and buying little things I needed. 




Also worth mentioning, I plan on working this summer and will probably be making about the same amount of money, although this is contingent on being hired. If I do find a job, my girlfriend and I are looking to find a place to rent and we've found some places that will let us rent for 3 months between $700 and $900 a month most with utilities included in rent. I estimate she'll be making around $400 a week and I should be making around $500 a week. We're splitting rent and expenses 50/50 and I've rough estimated it'll be around $600-800 a month from each of us. 

**TL;DR** We're doing as a couple this for 3 months 

* Making $3600/month combined
* $700-900/mo on rent+utilities 
* Estimating another $250-400 a month in other expenses combined.
* So rough estimating I myself will be spending $600-$800 a month of my $2000/mo salary



I currently have a $14,500 nest-egg saved up, with $13000 in savings getting a 0.15% interest rate. I know about the 6 months of salary saved up rule of thumb, so that's around $7K for me. I don't really have plans to buy a house any time within the next 10 years, but I imagine I'll need a new car after 2020.

personalfinance,"Debt advice, should I pay off credit cards with student loan money?","The gist of the story is I took out student loans for graduate school this year, unaware I would get funding through a department assistant position.

One card has a 10% interest rate, the other is 13%. 

I am obviously not great with finances, but I have reigned in spending and created a budget. I'm not incurring additional credit card debt, but I was your typical financially carefree undergraduate so I am carrying about $15k in credit card and private student loan debt.

I also have a full time job in addition to my stipend from school, so I can shift the usual monthly credit card payments to paying off all the interest and some balance each month for these unsubsidized loans. I am currently making the interest plus some payments each month, so paying off these credit card balances seems like a two birds with one stone situation.

I don't necessarily know what additional information is needed to help answer my question because I am new to reddit and this subreddit. I will give anything else required for some financial guidance if you can let me know what other information would better answer the question.

personalfinance,Financing college,"Hello /r/personalfinance, I am a high school senior going on to college next year and deciding between two schools that I have narrowed it down to. 

School A will cost me ~$18,000/year out of pocket plus ~$5,000/year federal loans. This school is the school I grew up wanting to go to, is much more of a ""college experience"" school and away from home than the other, and where a lot of my good friends are going. It is also the only school in my state (Michigan) with the minor for the career field that I want to go into. 

School B is a close to home commuter school and would be essentially free if I lived at home because of the merit scholarships that they offered me. It's a smaller school than school A and if I went here, I would transfer to school A after two years most importantly to graduate with the minor in my career field. 

Essentially what I am asking is what things can I do help finance school A without having to takeout additional loans on the $18,000? I am planning to work through school 20 hours at least, but I'm not sure I would want to/could juggle working full time (I'm planning to double major with a minor). I am trying to find the jobs/companies that would pay the highest to help me meet that cost with not too many prior experiences except for one year cash handling/customer service in a credit union. Also what companies offer the best tuition reimbursement programs for part time that either aren't for future career development or are in a healthcare/medical technology or engineering setting if it is?

personalfinance,Invest money instead of paying student loan interest?,"I am about to enter a 6 year medical residency. We have 200k in student loans and a family of 5. We will enter IBR which will make our required loan payments close to 0 per month. On a salary of 50k, we can probably afford to pay more than is required towards our student loans since we will live in a low cost area.

However, since the interest does not capitalize until the end of residency, are we better off investing any money we have left over after an emergency fund is built up, and then paying off interest right before residency ends with this money? Or should we try and pay off the interest on loans that have accrued the lowest amount of interest first so we can then attempt to pay off principle on those loans (correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I can pay principal on loans that do not capitalize until interest is paid off)? Of course, we will pay off 2500 of interest yearly for the tax benefit, but is there a benefit to paying off more than that since the interest does not capitalize?

EDIT:

Here are my loan balances:

Direct unsub stafford loan: 6.8%
Unpaid Interest: $2,847.46 (capitalizes at end of grace period January 2016)

I also have 51K in private institutional loans / perkins loans that I plan to eventually refinance.

My plan is to pay off as much interest as I can in my grace period while I am making mone before capitalization. Once it capitalizes, I suppose I will make the minimum IBR payment and then pay extra towards the highest loans. I forgot that my interest capitalizes when I graduate, which means I will not have much interest accrued during residency, which means I can easily tackle principle on the highest interest loan.

However, the acceleration in the rate of rouble appreciation over the past couple of weeks cannot be justified based on the development in oil prices and the general global financial environment.

Danske Bank expects rouble weakness to resume, driven by significantly higher Russian inflation than in the outside world, continued very weak growth and a desire on the part of the central bank to ease monetary policy.

personalfinance,Quick question regarding federal tax extension (form 4868),"Hoping /u/taxmankeith chimes in here...

I realized a few weeks ago that I was going to need to file an extension, due primarily to having to deal with forms that I am unfamiliar with (related to sale/liquidation of my employer and sale of stock options).

I figured out what my income tax liability *should* be, and paid that amount online to the IRS (debited directly from checking; the ACH has already occurred).  After this, I e-filed form 4868 using TaxAct.  While I was filling out the form, I realized that it was prompting me to pay again, even though I had already paid.  I understand that this was my fault (I paid before I filed), and wasn't sure what to do to avoid sending them my tax liability twice.  My solution was to make the ""Amount Paid"" and ""Amount Owed"" (I believe these are lines 5 and 6, or somewhere thereabouts) the same number, bringing my liability due **when filing** down to $0.

My question is whether or not I will get burned on this?  I believe I'm probably fine since I did pay already, and that payment is linked to my SSN (I also had to specify that the payment was to be put towards 2014 extension), but it will probably look odd since I sent in $xxx put claimed I owed nothing on the actual form.

* German yield are now in deep negative up to 7 years, 10 year is yielding 0.17% just shy of negative zone.

* Yields in France is negative up to 4 years, 10 year is hovering around 0.46%.

* Italian 10 year is yielding just 1.26%.

* UK, which was supposed to hike rates this year, saw 10 year yield drop from 2.5% in June to 1.6% as of now.

In contrast to the above -

Very long background info:
I am currently finishing up my final year of undergrad as a Sociologly major (definitely not ideal w/o a Masters) from a large urban Liberal Arts College. I also have an Associates in Math &amp; Science from a local community college. I plan on going back to school to get a masters in Public Health or continuing on to a dental hygienist program. Most likely it will be dental hygiene. Because I have an associates in math &amp; science I already have most of my prerequisites done, but I still need to take another class or two and I can't afford to jump right back into school full time. Also, if I do enroll in the dental hygiene program it is full time and about an hour away so working a PT job through it will be difficult.
For the past six years I have been working at the same place, I currently earn $14/hr and work about 12 hours a week. I'm not sure if I'll be offered more hours now that I have more available hours. Ideally, for the next year I would like to find a FT/PT job in a more professional setting that would be M-F 9-5 or something similar for part time. I would really like to get away from working weekends for 12 hours at a time consistently and having to work every single holiday. Plus, there is a new owner and she is just terrible. Most of my income has come from both this job and nannying for different families, which pays very well.
Also, for the past year, I have been interning at a large city agency where I gained a lot of literature searching/writing skills, research skills, and data analyst skills. I have not been offered a more permanent position, nor would I like to work there.
Upon graduation I will have to/hope to:
Buy a used car. Hoping to put $10k down and have ~$100-$150 dollar payments with ~$100 in car insurance/month.
Start contributing to rent &amp; bills. My boyfriend currently pays for everything, I pay for groceries but would like to start giving what I can ideally $200-$300/month..he is still $20k in student loan debt, and is going back to get an additional certification.
Continue paying my phone bill ($100/month)
Continue paying my credit card bills. I use them mostly just to build my credit so I will put $100 dollars on and then pay it off completely the same month.
Attempt to pay off my student loans. Currently I have $10k in federal Stafford (?) loans.
Attend one or two classes throughout the week starting in the Fall Semester (day or evening).
So my questions are:
What is the best way I can budget or cut out expenses to save up money for the next year?
Suggestions for where to look for a job? What field? Easiest way to make money?
Any other suggestions are definitely appreciated/welcome

The past 3 years (during which time I've gotten this income amount) I've gotten tax refunds over $2000, and this year I learned you can change that.

I used the IRS allowances calculator.  It said that if I change my allowances from 1 to 4, they will stop taking out ANY taxes this year and my refund will only be about $100, which sounds good to me.

personalfinance,Chase Slate Balance Transfer to checking,"Hello PF,

I didn't think this inquiry would be suitable for /r/churning and /r/creditcards is dead, so I hope it is alright to ask this here.

I recently called BoA to ask about a retroactive application for one of their Bank AmeriDeals and the CSR said there was nothing they can do about it, the ""system"" automatically handles it. (Turns out I got the Cash Back deal anyway). In return, they offered me a balance transfer for my credit card with a 3% fee and 0% APR for 18 months. Typical offer, I know, but the CSR said something that caught my interests - they would allow me to direct deposit the amount to a checking account! This is **not** a cash advance.

I am responsible with my credit so I took care of all the purchase transactions first as to not accrue interest and plan to pay the minimum amount due each month to make use of this money now. I will use this cash to pay off a couple federal unsubsidized loans at 6.8%, 6.8%, and 6.21%, thus saving me the cost of interest in the long run.

I want to continue using this method for the rest of my other unsubsidized student loans with the Chase Slate card. 0% fee, 0% APR for 15 months, it would be great to save almost $2,500 in interest by the time I fully pay off this BT amount before the promotional period ends.

**My question is:** Does anyone have personal experience with receiving Chase Slate's balance transfer in cash via direct deposit into a checking account? I don't want to do the BT to another card and then request a refund because of the ""overpaid amount"".

Edit: **I may end up needing to do this balance overpay with an existing credit card and then request to refund the negative amount.**

I've read that it is a YMMV with different financial institutions based on a couple sources. Though these sources also say Chase does allow BT checks to checking accounts.

Bitcoin,How To End Police Brutality: Leveraging the Power in Numbers and Data Integrity with the Blockchain,"Imagine a world where the actions of law enforcement are heavily scrutinized and tracked. Just how the government tracks our daily movement, internet activity, and communications, we should have the same ability, to an extent, when it comes to monitoring police brutality. This concept would seem beneficial and rational, yet there is no government sponsored organization in existence to monitor this situation. There may be Internal Affairs departments within a police department but clearly, Internal Affairs is capable of investigating police misconduct, not preventing it. There may be politicians, but all they do is act on the behalf of government or personal interests and motives. Additionally, such an implementation of preventative measures does not fall within the interests of the police department or even a government.

The police do not want the public to know the extent of their misconduct. And if the public was completely aware, I am sure many changes would be demanded of across multiple police departments and federal agencies. Thus, a system to monitor police brutality does not fall within the interests of state and federal government. Subsequently, law enforcement agencies are hungrier and hungrier for larger budgets. Preventative measures against police brutality need to leverage a department's ability to obtain a larger budget in order to put the supervisors and superiors of these officers under the threat of monetary consequence. So if one police officer screws up, the entire department must suffer.

This is the same mentality introduced in sports. If the running back of a football team screws up a play, the entire team is penalized, not just him. This is done so that the running back is supported by his teammates to complete his job correctly since they are ALL under the threat of consequence for an individual's actions. As a result, the entire team is incentivized to play by the rules and is incentivized to ensure that each and every person among them plays by the rules.

By applying such a methodology to law enforcement, I believe that we can truly make a difference. However, since we have no control over the budgets of police departments, we must work with what we have got. And that is, the power in numbers. 

Everyday, I see videos and read accounts of police brutality that receive tens of millions of views at a time. These accounts of such experiences spread like wildfire and are a huge controversy over social media networks. This is due to societies desire to raise awareness of such misconduct. However, as with any problem in life, we can run around in circles and talk about it all day but until we take action, nothing will ever happen. Protesting may seem like a viable action, however protests (more specifically, Ferguson) have been proven to lead to negative consequences. Destroying the property of innocent civilians and business owners does not correlate with a reduction in the amount of police misconduct and brutality, it only incites it even more. Yes it may raise awareness of the issue, but it also sheds light into just how irrational and illogical these protests can potentially be. Which in turn nullifies the protests credibility. 

So instead of gathering in person to violently or non-violently protest a cause, let's create a more structures and logical system of tracking such misconduct.

Imagine if we leveraged the benefits of data integrity and distributed networking to create a database of police brutality and misconduct that can then be linked to a rational call of action. Take for example the murder of Walter Scott. The bystander who recorded the incident had to wait some time before releasing the video. He was concerned for his own safety and chose to not notify the police of his evidence immediately in fear that they would disregard or destroy it. Well if he had published the video, along with any other associated data about the incident, onto a blockchain, his data integrity concerns would be alleviated and the evidence would be indisputable to an extent due to perfected, digital chain of custody or otherwise referred to as a consensus based ledger. Additionally, a link to the record within the database can be shared throughout social media outlets in order to attain supporters of a cause. 

So the system would work in this order:

1. User submits all known evidence of an incident involving police misconduct
2. The evidence is organized into a very user-friendly page that shows statistics and relevant data about the incident

I may not be a skilled programmer but still am an enthusiast of distributed and decentralized technologies. I also understand just how such distributed infrastructure for data can be used to solve many problems involving corruption in our world.  I'm just hoping that we as a community can work towards solving problems of corruption beyond the scope of the financial industry and Bitcoin. So let me know what you think and maybe we can work towards taking action against corruption instead of running around in circles talking about all time.

Let's brainstorm some ideas and make this happen!

PS: If Joe from Florincoin is reading this, please consider this as a feature for Alexandria. (We had lunch at Minetta's Tavern in the downtown NYC last November if you can recall)

Other ideas of mine:

- Based on data within our database we can create a donation pool that donates money to police departments that are quantified to have the least amount of corruption. Essentially paying them for not being corrupt. If each of the million viewers of these police brutality videos donated one dollar to this cause, police departments would have a huge incentive to actually behave by the rules.",cryptocurrency,1428682893
personalfinance,"Budget Review/Advice for Single Guy - $100,000/yr","Hello fine people of personal finance, first of all I want to start by take a moment to say thank you to all of the contributors in this subreddit. I've been lurking here for awhile and feel like I understand what realistic goals I should have and a baseline of how to prepare for the future.

That being said I didn't have the luxury of my parents teaching me anything about money except to not bite off more than you can chew. I currently make $100,000/yr as a base salary with additional bonuses that can total up to $10,000 or more per year.

I recently started a new job and missed the initial window this year to jump into the company 401k. I should be able to sign up in June/July. I've requested the paperwork ahead of time so that I can see how much they match etc, but they allow for a maximum contribution of $15,000 annually. As of right now I don't plan on contributing more than they match, I believe that they match between 4-6% but won't know until I hear back from HR.

I have not opened a Roth IRA yet but that is my next course of action after I finish moving and I shouldn't have an issue meeting the contribution of $5,500 annually on my salary.

My current monthly expenses come to around $3,750 and my monthly take home after taxes is around $5,300. Keep in mind that this does not include the future 401k contributions and the health insurance that should kick in next month. I don't foresee the insurance being much, I am just a single person, no kids etc and they do chip in.

Up until now I have not done anything with my money except keep it in my checking account and I know this is the wrong approach, so I wanted your advice on what I should be doing. I currently have around $13,000 in my checking account, but some of this will be fluctuating as I move to the new area (security deposit, furniture, etc). Given my monthly expenses I should have an emergency fund of $22,500 with current expenses, I could obviously cut this number way down if I absolutely needed to. I work in a popular industry and feel that I would have no trouble finding another job if I ever lost mine but I would rather have the full fund just in case.

Now that I've written my life story here are my questions:

* What should I do with my emergency fund? What would you do if it were your emergency fund? I've seen [this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/22s5iz/where_should_i_keep_our_6month_emergency_fund/cgptw4u) but that tiered system didn't really appeal to me, am I just wrong or crazy?

* I've read numerous times that keeping money in your savings account isn't advantageous as the interest rates are so low, what would you recommend that I do with my leftover monthly take home? Keep it in a checking account for entertainment/fun purchases? Create some short term CDs? I would like to keep the money fairly liquid but also would like to know if there is a preferred way to make it work for me rather than just sit. 

*  I'm looking to cut down on my expenses in the future and the largest expense that I have right now is rent. I live in a fairly high cost of living area now for work and rent is $1854/mo. I would like to purchase a home 1-3 years from now but have read that you should be able to make a down payment of 20% to avoid paying PMI but I feel like the time it may take to save up that 20% I'll be throwing too much money away on rent. Is PMI that serious and I should absolutely meet that 20% or should I not worry too much about it and go for the home after a year or two?

Thank you in advance, I'm truly looking forward to having my finances more in order and continuing to learn what to do with money in the future.

Also as a side question, I haven't done my taxes yet (I know, I suck). If I were to open a Roth IRA before the 15th and drop in $5,500 for 2014, does that need to be reported on my taxes? Would you recommend taking almost half of my current liquidity and dropping it in for my situation? Sorry I'm unsure if you can pull money out of a Roth IRA easily if an emergency came up between now and when I could replenish it. Obviously if I did that replenishing the emergency fund would become priority number one.",finance,1428683407
personalfinance,What to do with money in foreign bank...,"When I moved to the US I left some funds home in Denmark, kind of like a safety net, just in case I hated it here and wanted to go back home in a hurry.

They have just been in a savings account, and the Danish interest rates are even worse than the US ones (0.5% for 3 year CD's).

I considered just converting them to USD and transferring them across the pond, but over the last year or so the dollars value against the DKK has exploded (from fx ~530 to over 700) so now might not be the best time...

I was thinking of doing so in a savings account at a credit union... but what about doing it as an IRA? IRA have higher interest rates - but my understanding is you can draw from them as long as you pay the tax upfront. Can I use an IRA to store my emergency fund?",finance,1428683709
Bitcoin,Negative Interest Rates and Bitcoin,"It appears we have entered a point in history where banks are beginning to charge people to store their currency, effectively creating a negative interest rate environment.

In a healthy economy, banks will pay you to have access to your currency, and in turn they lend that currency out at a rate higher than what they are paying the depositor to store their cash for them. This could be in the form of personal and business loans, or perhaps a mortgage.

Yet now, depositors are being charged to store their cash, thus creating an ecosystem whereby it becomes financially wiser to hide their cash under their mattresses than to pay a banker to store the currency for a fee.

One of the largest fears that any bank has is a run on the bank. It was the premise for the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"" when Jimmy Stewart pleaded with the depositors to allow the bank to hang onto the deposits, and I am looking at today's banking environment thinking to myself ""These bankers are laying the foundation for an environment whereby a bank run becomes inevitable"".

Many people are going to resent the idea of paying a banker to store their own savings. I resent the idea, and I am sure that others share my feelings as well. 

With this being the case, isn't the Federal Reserve sowing the seeds of banks' destruction by creating this environment? 

I could not imagine an environment whereby an account holder becomes more incentivized to withdraw their savings than when they are charged to have the bank hold their hard earned savings.

To complicate this issue further, these banks are working with leverage rates of 30 to 1 whereby they are permitted to lend out $30 for every $1 of deposits held in trust.

If 1% of the account holders decided they no longer wished to pay the bank for the privilege of them holding and using their savings and opted instead to store their cash under their mattresses, the conclusion would be devastating for the banks. There would be enough of a run on the bank, that the bank simply could not pay back the cash. The domino effect which would ensue is a scary proposition to say the least.

One of the major contributing factors to the last run up in bitcoin prices over a year ago was when the citizens of Cyprus become fearful of ""bail-ins"" whereby their personal savings were simply taken by their own government. In anticipation of this event, in conjunction with an effort to preserve their money, many citizens of Cyprus withdrew their cash and purchased bitcoin since they knew their bitcoin was out of the reach of the government of Cyprus.

These events in Cyprus were contributors to the huge spike in prices of bitcoin. Cyprus is puny in comparison to the amount of wealth that Americans have tied up in the US banking system.

If the Federal Reserve, and the banks continue down this same path, they are going to spook their own citizens into choosing to do exactly what the citizens of Cyprus did. 

The Federal Reserve as well as the banking elite despise bitcoin, yet their own actions are going to contribute to what I expect will be the next major leg-up in the bitcoin prices.

Hold strong bitcoiners. Your patience is going to be rewarded soon enough. I expect some time within the next year, the collective masses grow tired of the ongoing government thievery and will look at alternatives to the dollar. Bitcoin will be one of the most desirable alternatives when this day arrives, and when it does........bitcoin to the moon!",cryptocurrency,1428689017

Back story, she got her masters then went over to UAE to teach for 2 years and knocked down her loans a good amount.  She then came back to WA state and has been teaching in an elementary school.  She has been teaching there for 2 years after this school year.  I have a decent understanding about the PSLF program.  Here is what I understand about it. Her 2 years she has done so far qualifies for PSLF so she only has 8 years left.  She hasn’t enrolled in the PSLF program or consolidated her loans since she finished school in fear consolidation would disqualify her from federal and state payback programs.  

Here are her loans: 
Stafford Loan $28,960.67 interest rate 6.55%: monthly payment $288.36
(made up of Direct Unsubsidized Stafford: $12,482.84 and Direct Subsidized Stafford: $16,477.83)

Graduate PLUS loan $10,945.92 interest rate 7.65%: monthly payment $174.47
Total loan amount $39,906.59: total monthly payment $462.83

Lets say she goes with the PSLF her payment would probably be at most $300.  From what I understand only about $75-$100 of that would go to the principal each month.  If she decided to stop teaching in 5 years she would still owe over $30,000.
So if she knows she will be a teacher for the next 8 years PSLF would work for her.  What other options does she have if she is unsure about teaching in public schools the next 8 years?  Thank you",finance,1428689550

I've recently been approved for a mortgage and while I am pretty ecstatic over the whole thing, I am also freaking the eff out about my financial future.

To give you a picture of my current financial situation:
In terms of liabilities, I have a mortgage as well as a provincial and federal student loan. My loans together total just over $61,000. I have a credit card with only a $500 limit that is completely paid off. In terms of assets, I have a car that's worth about $10k and is completely paid off. 

Long story short, just after getting everything finalized for my mortgage, I was laid off from my job. I'm currently seeking job opportunities elsewhere and I do have a degree as well as a diploma under my belt, however I am finding it difficult to secure employment. I'm freaking out because I only have enough savings to pay all of my bills for about 3 months before my savings depletes. My son was born with a disability, and we do have some medical expenses that I pay out of pocket. For that reason, I am extremely uncomfortable with the thought of having zero savings left.

That aside, I'm wondering what my best options would be for saving after I do gain employment. I've crunched some numbers and I doubt I'll have much extra to put away after my bills are paid each month. I currently have an RESP set up for my son, and while I'd like to continue contributing to that, I'm wondering if it would be best to put that on hold for a little while. My son's father does not contribute financially or otherwise. Do I just stick everything extra into a savings account? Should I be investing for our future?

personalfinance,"29/USA, seeking advice on repairing credit","29 y.o., seeking some advice on repairing my credit.

I was married (and divorced) at a very young age, and as such, my credit tanked. It was almost entirely my fault and I can only attribute it to being young and ignorant.

 When I was divorced, I had no skillset, no education, no real experience at doing much of anything. I abandoned my property, moved several states away, got a job as a receptionist making $9.50/hour, and lived paycheck to paycheck. When all the bills started coming in, I had no idea how to handle it. I didn't know my credit rights. I had no medical insurance. I had no idea (at the time) that you could negotiate with creditors or talk to them at all if you were experiencing rough financial circumstances. So, I did the worst possible thing and just ignored them. Bill after bill went into the shredder. I got sued. My credit cards were frozen. I was getting collection notices and calls daily for bills, medical bills, student loans, everything.

Fast forward to today's world. I have a completed education (at the cost of student loans, unfortunately), good career, decent/liveable wages with a really good and very solid company, health insurance, etc. I have been taking bites out of my debt here and there but my current life circumstances seem to be heading for rocky territory, so I've decided to make the most of my situation now and throw myself into getting this debt managed so that I can independently own property, cars, and credit cards again. Here's a little breakdown:

* I take home around $500/week. I receive monthly bonuses anywhere from 150 to 400 a month, depending on profitability. I have been throwing that either directly at debts or into an emergency savings fund.

* I use JP Morgan. I know everyone hates them and they get a lot of shit but I have been with them a long time and they're always pretty helpful. I have a standard checking and savings and, at minimum, I put $25/week into my savings.

* I pay around $200/month on my student loans and that is BARE MINIMUM payment. I have a gym membership around $30/month. I pay about $100/week in gas. I pay $150/month to the credit card companies that sued me in my previous story, bare minimum. I pay around $80 for my phone. I buy all the household goods, pet supplies, and groceries.

* I have around $38k in student loans. Two of them are FedLoan/MoHELA, two are private loans. 

* I do not know my total debt aside from student loans. Through being negligent and ignoring my bills in the past, I lost track of whom I owe and how much and for what. I have some lingering debts that are many years old.

I have begun using Credit Karma to monitor my scores, changes, etc. It has also been helpful to helping me find old debts, but it isn't a fully inclusive service.

My score is listed as being mid to high 500 range.

What I'm looking for:

* I really hate to leave my bank, but they have no real benefit to me other than prompt service and being a consistent financial institution that I've maintained a positive relationship with for years. Any suggestions as to a better bank or banking practice, what I should look for in a bank?

* I would like recommendations on a secured credit card so that I can build a better credit reputation. I  began to apply for one recommended by Credit Karma and it required a deposit, then a waiting period for approval, and when I decided to stop and think about the ToS before committing, the company sent me tons and TONS of spam mail. Really douchey.

* How do I even go about finding out about old debts? As mentioned, I have used CK to find some of them, but I know there are more floating around that haven't been found, as CK doesn't even list all of my known student loans.

personalfinance,Yet another student loan advice post- any help appreciated!,"So while I've long figured that I wouldn't burden anyone with my problems, I've started feeling stressed and seek any wisdom or encouragement that this subreddit can offer. Essentially, I want to get rid of my student loans as efficiently as possible, while still enjoying some quality of life in my 20s.

Here are the details:

Loans:
26 year old with around 123k in federal student loan debt from law school and undergrad. 

Interest rates vary between 4%-7% depending on loan, overall average is probably around 6%.

Income:
Achieved job which will provide roughly 4.2k monthly AFTER taxes  minimal 401k, and health insurance. I will start this job full time this summer, and my loans are in Graceland until then.

This is a seemingly stable job, with regular bonuses and raises. I have been unofficially informed that I can expect to be making above 100k in 2-3 years if not less.

By the time I start work/repayment, I estimate I will have a little over 10k in the bank after starting bonus plus my savings.

Expenses:

Live in reasonably priced city and will be living with girlfriend. I make way more than girlfriend but she still helps with rent/groceries. Her income stream is a little unreliable, but helpful (part time odd jobs like babysitting, house sitting, etc).

Aside from loans, I only have ""normal expenses"" like transportation, groceries, rent, fun, etc.

My plan:

Monthly:4.2k income

Student Loans: 1.1k in a ""graduated repayment"" plan, that increases slightly every 2 years until repayment after 10 years. This reflects the fact that I will hopefully be making more money soon, and giving myself a little breathing room at the start.

Rent: 1k (Girlfriend may be able to knock this down to $500 some months, but again, can't rely on it).

Now I have 2.1k left. 

Save $500 a month for a rainy day fund.

1.6k

Good healthy groceries= $100/week (again, gf may help here).

1.2k

Transportation(will likely bus/walk/bike)= minimal

Now I suppose, with roughly 1.2k remaining, will it be irresponsible to use this money for fun and vacations? I recognize this comes down to personal choice, but I suppose I need validation that I am meeting my obligations and can afford to indulge.

I've seen some amazing helpful opinions on here, so here's hoping for the same.

financialindependence,How to Prioritize Saving for a Down Payment in an Expensive Area?,"This should possibly go in PersonalFinance or RealEstate, but those subs ignored my questions and/or were not particularly helpful. 
 
I am fortunate enough to have a fairly high income, but I live and work in a very expensive part of California.  I am frustrated that despite having earned a substantial salary for quite some time,  I do not yet own my home.   

I am married and have a newborn child.  I recently finished paying alimony to my first wife, and have paid off approximately $130k of student debt, leaving $20k at a variable 3.5% interest rate.  Other than my student loans, we I have no debt, we are maxing our retirement savings, and are saving up for a down payment.  

Because I work very long hours (sometimes 80+ hours per week), I want to live within a 30-45 minute commute of my office or I will never see my family.  As a result, the housing options available to me are very limited (i.e., expensive).  A 2-bedroom condo will cost approximately $700-$900k.  A 3 bedroom condo or a house will run $900k - $1.3m.  Based on what I currently pay in rent, and the mortgage interest deduction, I should be able to afford a monthly payment in the range of $5-7k.

1.  I have enough cash to pay off my student loans in full, but am inclined not to do so unless and until interest rates begin to rise.  Although they are variable, the rates on my outstanding student loans are based on 3-month LIBOR and reset quarterly.  So I’ll have lead-time to just pay them off if rates spike.  Thus, my plan is to keep paying a fixed amount (e.g., $500/month) and devote the remainder of my excess income to saving for a down payment.  It seems to go against prevailing wisdom to save for a down payment rather than pay off the remainder of my student debt.  Does my plan make any sense?  

2.  It looks like I can get a mortgage on a $900k house with about 15% down, which should be attainable in the next six months.  But I can get a better rate (about 1% lower) if I came up with 20% down.  To do so in next year, however, would require taking a loan of $30-50k from my 401(k).  That strikes me as a bad idea, but would be interested in the FI crowd’s wisdom. 

3.  Student loans aside, it seems like I may want to wait on purchasing a house until interest rates rise:  once mortgage rates go up, there will be downward pressure on prices.  And it is currently the down payment, not the monthly mortgage payments, that is currently the limiting factor in how much house I can afford.  That said, I know many who don’t think it is politically feasible for the FED to raise rates and the moment, and that it won’t happen until inflationary concerns require it.  At that point, I’m less sure on the effect that a rate increase will have on home prices.  Basically, my friends in real estate think now is the time to buy, and no one else seems to know what they’re talking about.  Should I buy soon and potentially wind up underwater if home values tank after a rise in interest rates?  Or wait for the Fed to move and continue paying astronomical rent?",finance,1428700742
personalfinance,Bond funds and interest rates,"I know there's been a lot of discussion and countless doomsday prophesiers talking about the impending collapse of the US bond market due to the possibility of interest rate increases.  I also recognize that there are several individuals on this board that are pro-100% equity positions.  Let me first say: **I am not looking for suggestions as to whether I should go 100% stocks or not.**  I believe bonds play an important role to equity holdings.

I've currently got about 20% of my portfolio in Vanguard's Total Bond (VBMFX) 

**Questions**

1.  Are any of you shifting your bond fund positions or purchasing individual bonds (knowing that you won't lose principal as long as you hold onto the bond until maturity)?

2.  In theory, wouldn't bond funds take an initial hit, but rally as newer, higher interest rate notes came were purchased by fund managers?  I know this is a tough answer given that QE to this level is unheard of.",finance,1428700844
personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment view,"I read the following on /r/studentloans...

***I am in almost an identical situation as you (116,000K consolidated on IBR with a $233 monthly payment) and I have studied this extensively. Regardless of your income the maximum number of payments you will owe is 300 (25yrs x 12 months). The downside to making too much (going above the 10 year repayment plan monthly payment) is that all the interest that accrues will then capitalize. Right now it accrues but doesn't add to the principle so there is no compounding effect.

For you to go above your IBR limit and have interest capitalization occur your AGI needs to be about $120,000 (for me it's $118,000). But you can make considerably more and keep your AGI under that number. Adding in 401k, IRA, and HSA contributions you could earn about $146,850/annual before your interest capitalizes.

Important Note: All forgiven debt will be considered taxable income for that year (as it stands by the law today). For you, if you continued to pay all your payments at the exact same rate of $280/month (unlikely since your income will probably increase over time) then when your loans are forgiven you will have an additional tax liability of about $50,000 to the IRS that year (I'd recommend living in a state without income tax that year fyi).

Since your situation is very similar to mine i'll just tell you my plan. I max out all retirement plans (HSA, 401K, IRA), take any extra and put in taxable accounts applying capital loss harvesting, and use this to minimize my student loan payments going forward. This is because my loans (which are on autopay) only have an interest rate of 5.5%. over the next 25 years my investments should average 7% meaning I will make more by investing than paying my loans. but say they don't and my returns on investment only average out to be 4%. I'm still ahead! That is because that 4% ROI is compounding while that 5.5% student loan interest is not!

Long story short. I save 65% of my income, minimize my student loan payments, and plan on retiring by 45. I'll still have a decade of SL repayment but when you keep your AGI low even a $0 a month payment counts as a qualified payment towards your 25 years. So I just save up $1-2K per year for that harsh tax penalty i'll take later on. But in the end its more financially sound to invest the money for me than pay back student loans. My total amount paid (including taxes) is about $10K less than a 10 year repayment plan AND I get to use all the money i'm saving in the mean time and invest it in diversified index funds for long term growth.***

personalfinance,"No Debt, No Established Credit, How do I get a CC?","I'm a 25 y/o Male with no debt, I pay all of my bills on time, am gainfully employed, and I cannot for the life of me get a damn credit card.

I don't necessarily need one, but I'm getting older and I figure if I haven't established any credit, I should definitely start building some in case I plan to buy a home in the future. 

Since my dad was doing very well while I was in college, he took out personal loans at a lower interest rate, and I would pay him back instead of paying more down the road. Overall, this cut my bills down dramatically, but left me without any long term debt to reference when applying for credit cards. I also worked in restaurants, and unfortuantely since it's a cash business, it didn't look like I made any real substantial money.

Anyone know of a good way to get a credit card with a decent interest rate to help build or establish credit? I'm sure this is a common question but I've tried a few different methods and none worked...even Discover won't give me a card. The only real option I can think of is going through my bank, but they require a pretty sizable deposit upfront, and I don't have that kind of money right now.

personalfinance,New job; how to realistically budget for emergency fund and college fund?,"Just a quick little backstory. Recently I had been working from home as technical support at 10/hr with my fiance working as a help desk agent for a college at 20/hr, so collectively we brought around a consistent 3542/mth. However, after the first three months and they brought the new WAH agents out of production, management realized they had overstaffed, as we would have many agents idle for anywhere between 15 to 40 minutes. They started offering jump offs (unpaid time off) to avoid mandatory UPTO, but the noticeable difference was the drop from a consistent 40 hours a week to 32.

Long story short, I was able to secure a better paying job (also 20/hr at 40 hours a week) and **anticipate to be making more around the ballpark of 4700 a month.** *(Caps to help you know what to look for.)*  We will be both be getting paid weekly. So my question to you is, financial gurus, based on our current expenses, how much realistically should we set aside every month for an emergency fund (high priority) and start on his college fund (lower priority than emergency fund, as, obviously, there's quite a bit a time before it's relevant, but we'd like to have *at least* 5-10k in it by the time he is 18.)

Our expenses are as follows:


Expense | Cost
---|---
Rent | 1155.00
Cellphones | 230.00
Medical | 86.00
Car Insurance | 260.00
Car Note | 484.00^1
Comcast | 113.00
Electric | 70.00
Groceries | 200.00
Gas | 200.00
Personal Loan | 108.61
Baby Formula | 120.00^2
Fast Food | 200.00^3

^1: Yes, we are looking into refinancing. He is overpaying for his camaro by... a lot.

^2: This may vary as we switch him to solids and juice more consistently, but probably never less than 60.

^3: Yes, we are looking into more meal prep. Ideally, what should be an appropriate amount spent on fast food? 100? We do like to eat out at restaurants every other Friday so that does account for about 80 of that.

That being said! How much should we be putting aside every month for an emergency fund based on our new monthly budget?  Would you say putting aside 15 to 30 dollars for a college fund a week is good? Any other ways we maybe could look at saving some expenses? I may be able to lessen our comcast bill by cutting our home phone service since I won't be working from home anymore, but that's all I can see besides the previously mentioned notes.

I've been looking into budgeting and decided to (mostly) try the 50/20/30 approach because it feels more flexible to me. Here's what I have right now:  
  
Income: $2300-2500 monthly depending on bonuses. Budgeted toward 2300.  
  
Fixed Expenses:  
Rent - $510

Emergency fund - $250  
Debt payoff - $105 (toward accounts in collections, total is under $3000)  
Total - $355 (~15%)  
  
Flexible spending  
$690 (30%)  
Normal expenses include:  
Food - $250  
Gas - $150  
$390 leftover for entertainment/overages on food and gas. Remainder will be put into savings.  
  
Does this look about like what I should be doing? I'm aware the car payment is high and the storage building may seem like an unnecessary expense. After a year or two rebuilding my credit, I hope to be able to refinance the car at a lower interest rate to save considerably (with my poor credit, I was only able to get an 18% interest rate).  
I am starting the emergency fund from scratch so that is currently my number one objective - I've already set up a capital one 360 savings account and have updated my direct deposit to put in $125 per paycheck. Once this reaches an initial goal of $2000, I plan to more aggressively pursue paying off my debt, then continuing to build the fund.  
I don't currently have television service or internet, in case you were wondering why they were not on my budget.  
I'm also currently contributing to an employer matched 401k, if that makes a difference.

personalfinance,SoFi Conditional Pre-Approval (Personal Loan),"I previously refinanced about $10k in student loans with SoFi. I don't remember exactly how the application process went that time, but I remember it being pretty straightforward and not at all confusing.


However, I recently applied for a personal loan with SoFi. Before I even submitted the application, I recall there being a message saying I was conditionally pre-approved for a few term/rate combinations. So I chose the seven-year term option, submitted my application, and uploaded scanned documents (most recent pay stub, passport, utility bill) as requested. About a week passed, during which I know SoFi pulled my credit report, and then I received an e-mail, which read, ""Congratulations Brandon! SoFi has conditionally preapproved you for a Personal Loan."" The e-mail also included a list of interest rate/term options from which I could choose and indicated that I should upload some documents (proof of income, identity, and address) on SoFi's website.


Needless to say, I was a bit confused, since I had been conditionally pre-approved and submitted all of those documents a week earlier. I wondered if anything had changed to prompt this e-mail. I called SoFi, and they weren't terribly helpful, telling me that my application for the seven-year loan was under review and not much else.


Is anybody here familiar with what conditional pre-approval means to SoFi? Am I any closer to getting the loan now than I was when I first applied? Or was this e-mail basically telling me that nothing had changed over the past week and the review process was just starting?


I guess it doesn't really matter. I'll know when I know, and until that time, there's nothing I can do. I was just a bit confused by that e-mail.",finance,1428708478

* I have aprox €2K in credit card debt (crept up these last two months - next month is bonus month and I'll pay this all off)
* I have aprox €200 a month in expenses (mobile phone, gym membership, etc..)
* I have aprox $17K in stocks (mostly in UCO which I'm hoping to double when oil prices start to grow again - I'm not in a rush here)
* I allow myself a €2K a month living allowance, although I'd like to up this slightly 

*Discretionary Spending*

* I like classic sports cars, I own 4 (will not divulge the marque as it's a rarity and will identify me instantly) these have cost quite a lot to get up to scratch but are now a more or less a €0 expense (classic insurance &amp; licence rates are €18 a year each). They appreciate faster than the costs they incur
* I like race cars and have just dropped €25K on bringing my track car up to GT3 Spec and will be racing a full season next year. This I know is *NOT* wise spending but is more or less the only thing that makes my heart tick and that motivates me to work hard 
* I like watches and aim to upgrade my watch by aprox €3K every year. This I can survive without 
* I eat heathy and live off fresh tuna &amp; steaks. There's no pasta in my kitchen, just lean meats &amp; veg. 

*Short Term Financial Goals*

* I have set a target to save €30K by end of year as a safety net
* I would like to buy a second property as a rental within 2 years
* I will swap over the money I have invested in UCO into a safer mutual fund once I get the growth I'm after

*Long Term Goals*

My long term goal is to build a strong passive income. Lump sums for retirement are not *that* important  as I'm set to inherit a decent amount of cash &amp; properties when my parents pass. 

The best solution I've come up for this is to pile all my spare money (after I've built the €30K cushion) into paying off my mortgage, once thats done I'd apply for a second one to buy a second property, rent that out too and rinse wash repeat to build a holding of 3-4 properties in the next 10 years.

Help.,"No one would accuse me of being a paragon of personal finance over the last few years, but I've been trying hard to reverse that and I feel like I'm back on track. I consolidated a couple of credit cards to a 0% interest card and am making regular payments to get rid of the credit card debt in about a year from now, well ahead of the 24 month 0% time-period. I've brought the balance down to $6,000 from $8,500 since the beginning of the year. I am also working very hard to get my emergency fund to where I want it to be and have about $3,500 there. With that said, when I was doing my taxes back in February as I finished up I realized I owed nearly $1,700 between federal and state taxes!! So it turns out I had completely screwed up my last W-9 I filled out when I started my current job midway though 2013 and I had THREE exemptions as a single guy with no kids. To say I misinterpreted the language would be an understatement (claim 1 if you are the head of your household - ""well, I'm the head of my household"" d'oh!). So here's my question, do I wipe out my emergency fund on such a frustratingly, bone-headed emergency or do I put my tax bill on my 0% card and extend my payments out another couple of months?

TL:DR - was claiming three exemptions on my W-9 when I should have had one or even zero and now I owe $1700 in taxes. Is this the type of emergency I created my emergency fund for (even though I am the moron who created the emergency) or do I take advantage of available bandwidth on a 0% interest credit card that I am currently paying off?

Edit: I called my credit card company and it looks like the 0% interest rate period was only for balance transfers and not new purchases. So I guess that clears that up. My billing cycle closes today, so I'll pay my tax bill tomorrow on my current card and put off that payment a few weeks until the next bill is due, at least I'll be able to sock away a little more in savings in the meantime.

personalfinance,$52K and finally DEBT FREEE!! Here is our story...,"My wife and I have been working for this day and finally sent out our last payment and are officially DEBT FREE!

**Accumulation of Debt**

-My wife and I both attended college, which accounts for the bulk of our student loans. My wife made the smart decision to attend community college for her first two years which put us in a MUCH better position. I was fortunate and now ETERNALLY grateful to my parents who paid for my 4 year public education. Upon graduation, we had about $42K student loan debt.

-We got married quickly after graduation in the summer of 2012. Before becoming financially savvy, we compounded our $42K student loan debt with a $10K car loan just months later. 

**How we got out of Debt**

In Jan of 2013, my wife and I were introduced to Dave Ramsey. We got ""gazelle intense"" about our debt. Since then, our average combined salary has been around $95k. We committed to paying $2,000 a month to dig ourselves out of the hole we made. Some months we were able to put more down and some we did a bit less, but the important thing was to stay committed to paying it off. I won't lie, it hurt. We didn't get to take the extravagant vacations or go out to eat and drinks with our friends as often as we would have liked. We haven't been able to buy a house. Sacrifice is a huge part of getting out of debt. After 27 months of hard work, we did it! We called Wells Fargo and scheduled our final payment!


**Now What?**

What I'm looking forward to the most is watching the number on that bank account go up. We will be getting a 6 month emergency fund started. No longer do I have to watch the bank account go to $3000 after a paycheck down to $1000 almost immediately after a payment. Now I can watch it compound month after month! Once that is in place, we can save up for the house we have been wanting for years!

**Lessons Learned**


*About accumulation of debt*

Debt is a scary thing, especially student loans! As an 18 year old heading into college, you don't (or at least I didn't) care to think about the long-term repercussions this would have. We had to put our life on hold for over 2 years because of this: no house, no vacations, even holding off starting a family so we could be in a better financial position for my wife to be a stay at home mom. Teens don't have the foresight to consider these types of things and it makes this debt dangerous!

*About paying off loans*

1. I know Reddit isn't often the religious type but the Bible does provide a verse that has rang true through our debt repayment journey. Hebrews 12:11 ""No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening--it's painful! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way."" I don't think I need to explain why this is relevant.

2. There is something to be said about the order of paying off loans. We listed our loans smallest to largest and started by paying them off in that order. The momentum you gain by checking off one then another and then a third within a few months really helps you gain traction in getting the snowball rolling. It is the EMOTIONAL victory (not mathematical) that keeps you motivated to pursue financial freedom. However, in our personal journey, once the small ones were paid, we flipped to paying the highest interest rate loans. There is certainly something to be said for the initial boost of confidence for paying the small ones off quickly though!


I hope you all can take something from our debt free journey and hope it motivates you all the keep going! **There is an end in sight** and the feeling of not owing anyone anything is literally worth every penny!",finance,1428763081
personalfinance,(UK),"Hello /r/personalfinance, I'm in a bit of a predicament with my decision to attend masters programmes with business schools in the UK.

personalfinance,Help me plan for college and explain the 529 savings plan.,"Hello! r/personal finance. Help me budget for college.
  A little bit of background on me:
  *  I am 18 years old and starting college this coming August. I was accepted to my top choice, but am finding it difficult in closing the gap in terms of funding. 
  * The school is giving me around $35,000 and the total cost for attendance is around $47,000. That leaves me with around $15,000 (+ books and other expenses) to pay out of pocket.
  * I graduated a semester early (although I with graduate with my peers) and I am working at the moment. 2,000 or so in savings.
  * My parents could contribute around $3,000 per year. 
  * I know I can definitely work while in college and do other things to gather money. 
Could you guys explain how a 529 works (I already opened one, although it might be too late) and how to invest my money to get the best possible return? Are there any other resources I could tap into to find funding? 
My dilemma: 
  * Ineligible for federal aid, and cannot take out subsidized loans. We want to pay off most of the cost by ourselves, but know it might come down to taking out a small loan. Any help on finding the best loan options?

Some backstory...

Ive been managing my own personal finances over the past few years and after reviewing several posts here I think I could use some help in terms of moving some money around.

Im 31, married...gross household income is generally a bit shy of 250k/year. 

My wife and I have 3 accounts...mine, hers and ours.   At this point Id like to just discuss my own...

At this point I have 140k in a 401k
Roughly 220k sitting in cash
68k in a personal trading account 26k in options (total 94k-ish)
Student loan debt at 9k (consolidated at very low interest rate)...plan on paying off this year, but in no hurry.
No other loans at all for my family.
Credit cards paid in full every month
Full mortgage payment is 1700/month and have about 75k equity in our current home.

I feel my 401k is way too low for my age. At this point I am maxing it out. What type of personal retirement account would you recommend me adding? An IRA?  How would I go about doing this? Local bank?

Also..what should I do with with the cash?  I am considering investing it in a vanguard fund and just letting it sit.  The smaller (68k fund) I trade myself rather aggressively and have done fairly well with.  

I started getting interested in the markets in 2007 and since then am very hesitant to put a lot of money into the market after watching what happened in 2008, but in some ways I feel Im foolish for letting so much cash sit at a terrible interest rate.

personalfinance,Roth IRA Conversion Tax questions,"Quick bio:
age 32, live/work in CA (we have a state income tax)

In 2014, I converted a significant amount of my Traditional IRA savings into Roth IRA. I was planning on paying the income taxes associated with the conversion from a savings account rather than having the taxes deducted from the Roth IRA.

Now that tax season has come, I'm finding myself regretting the decision to convert because:

1) Although I planned on paying the conversion income taxes, I haven't been able to save enough to do so

2) I plan to set up several IRAs, each with a distinct asset class so that I can strategically convert the assets that gain value during the tax year, and recharacterize the assets that lose value.

3) There are some other advantages to waiting to convert, such as the possibility I will get a better paying job this year (to better afford the taxes) or if the overall value of my traditional IRA drops I can convert more of it to Roth and pay a lower tax bill.

My question is: has anyone out there filed taxes in California after recharacterizing their Roth IRAs? I was planning on filing a federal extension, and Californians don't have to file state returns until October 15th, but we have to *pay* both federal and state taxes by April 15th. 

Should I be preparing my taxes now under the assumption that I will have recharacterized my IRA by October 15th, and thus no need to report the conversion on tax forms, or am I responsible for estimating the federal and state taxes due as of now, paying them, and would then have to file amended returns, requesting refunds when I determine the excess amount in taxes I have paid? I can recharacterize all of the assets I converted now, but I won't get the tax forms in time to properly assess what I owe by April 15th.",finance,1428787349

personalfinance,We are looking into purchasing a second house as an investment (rental) property. Does this make sense?,"Here are the details:

* We currently own a ~$450,000 house and **owe $315,000** on it with 26 years remaining on our mortgage.
* Our interest rate is currently **3.125% fixed** (which is awesome!)
* The property we are interested in is asking **$200,000.** It last sold in 2007 for $177,000 and has since been completely remodeled.
* We would like to use it solely for long and short term rentals.
* We expect we could receive **$1,200 - $1,600 in rent** each month, depending on whether we rent long or short term.
* The neighborhood is desirable, near great schools, next to a park, low crime, 2 bedroom 1 bath, fenced back yard.
* Comparable homes in the neighborhood....well, there aren't any. Houses rarely come available, and when they do they are snatched up within days. Most of the recent comparable are manufactured homes, which are, well....not comparable. 
* This particular house was listed 3 days ago, and the realtor expects several offers to entertain on Monday. Which doesn't surprise us given the research we have conducted in the area over the past two years while looking for a solid investment home, and how fast things move. We feel pressure to make a fast decision.
* We live in the same neighborhood, and would take care of maintenance ourselves.
* There is nothing major wrong with the house---renters could move right in.
* We are interested in long-term ROI at medium risk.
* We currently have about **$20,000** in easily accessible assets we could liquidate for a downpayment, or $40,000 if we sold some shares and hard assets.
* We are in our mid-30's and really feel like now is the time to be setting ourselves up with some solid investments for our future.

**Our financial picture:**

Income:

* $145,000 joint regular income each year.
* $10,000-$15,000 supplemental income each year (private contracts).

Debts:

* $315,000 mortgage. 
* $450 per month car loan (0% interest, 5 years remaining) 

Assets:

* $20,000 boat (owned)
* $20,000 truck (owned)
* $10,000 other vehicles (motorbikes, ride on lawn mower) (owned)
* $2,500 precious metals (owned)
* $35,000 in stocks, mutual funds, etc. (owned)

**For our situation, which makes the most sense?**

* Take out an additional mortgage with 10% down (15 year perhaps?) Is 10% even possible on an investment 
* Refinance? We'd lose our awesome interest rate, but we might be better off in the long run with only carrying one mortgage....
* What other options are there out there that we don't know about?

Other questions:

* Is this a smart move?
*  Are there other investment opportunities/potentials we should be looking at instead of real estate?

personalfinance,Why is it OK for agism to be affecting a credit score?,"I am 27. I graduated college in 2008 (Great Timing!) and was not able to find enough work to cover cost of living and keep up with my student loadns. I understand this part. It's f***ed up but I get it. I did try to work with me but even on their most lean plans I could not keep up. This is the ""Serious delinquency"". I never hid from the collectors. I kept an open line of communication with them. Over time they went from jamming me up every day for money and threatening to put my parents into ruin (Now realizing early on everything they did was illegal) to being very understanding and really trying to work with me. I wasn't making a dent on even the interest. 

My wife and I got sick and tired of renting short lease apartments, crappy craigslist roommates, and occassionally having to move back to my parents. We got our Sh*t together and spent years on a very strict financial diet. Years later, our student loans have been paid off. I even got most of the lenders to not just send me pay off letters but agree to reconcile the discrepancies. My credit REPORT looks clean, but my credit score in still hanging onto it.

Now with two kids we wanted to take it a step further.
In October, I worked with a broker who worked with me dilligently every single day getting every day, and to make a long story short, we bought a house. We bought the cheapest house in an expensive area with great schools. I got in by the skin on my back. It literally came down to my work offering to change my ""profit sharing"" to ""Bonus"". This technicality brought my income to debt ratio by just enough that I was able to close. Six months later my broker calls me, and tell me we are going to refi. She got me a better rate, we dropped a MIT fee rolled into the mortgage, and basically brought the mortgage from 4.5% to 3.6%, over $300 off my payment. 

**TLDR**:

Student loans went delinquent

After years of hard work, paid off all debt

More hard work, bought a car with my wife. 

 More saving, leased a new car.

Years go by, No missed payments, healthy credit usage.

One credit card to each me and my wife. (We buy groceries, gas, ect then pay it off before the eom)

Brought my scroe from . mid 500s to high 600s.

BARELY closed on a house in October

Just refinanced on the house saving over $300 a month on the mortgage payment


I have credit monitoring so every time my score changes I get notified and anytime something suspicious happens I get notifed. I See ""Your score has changed"" The score came DOWN. But why? I was on pace to break the 700 barrier. (Its been a personal goal of mine. I know its kind of arbitrary at this point but I want it)

The delinqency, its almost been 10 years. I know this will be forgiven soon. But the age and range of debt is really starting to get to me. I have years of healthy credit card use, I have financed two cars and currently a lease, never a missed payment. Almost a year with a mortgage, never missed a payment. I am 27 and have had credit since I was 18 and healthy credit since I was 21. At 23, all of my debt was paid and I became a free man. At 24 I bought a car with my wife. At 25 I leased a car for myself.

I've always felt this wasn't agism. It makes sense to consider someone with no credit to be ""potentially risky"". But after years of healthy credit and never missing a payment, why is this haunting me? I'm no longer young enough to whine about this being agism, but I dont know what to make of this. It really seems beyond my control now that I have very diverse credit, and all of them are healthy.",finance,1428853545

I worked in DE for a majority of the year, I am now back in MI. My SO (not-married) and Son lived in MI for all of 2014. My SO got a part-time job in MI, and made ~1500$. Per the [IRS](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Who-Can-I-Claim-as-a-Dependent%3F), I know I can claim her as a dependent.

Here are my questions :

1. I will need to file federal and DE, correct?
2. She will need to file federal and MI, correct? Or can I include her income in my filing?
3. If she does need to file, she will not be able to claim any dependants, as I paid for 75%+ of her (and our child's) living expenses, correct?

Since it's April it's almost time to commit to a college and I have very little time to figure this out all on my own. I am not a United States citizen and am a DACA recipient. This means I'm not available for any federal aid of any kind. I have decided that I will be attending a 4 year state college which means I would need around 48,000 dollars in loans to cover all 4 years of tuition and room and board. My only option then is to take out these student loans in the form of private loans with a co-signer.

personalfinance,Cannot see each Disbursement owed on Student Loan Website,"Hi,

I have been paying off my student loans and only have one left with one company. I have been paying more than I owe for over a year (next payment due Dec. 2016). According to the company, I have 10 disbursements with varying interest rates and amounts due (4 are 2.33% and 6 are 6.8%). 

The thing is, on the website I cannot see what I owe on each disbursement and cannot choose to pay more on one of the others. MyFedLoan let me pay off the disbursements however I wanted, but i found out a couple months ago for this loan company I need to call in after my payment goes through to request my payment goes to certain disbursements.

I called this past week to find out what I owe on each disbursement and request the higher interest loans be paid off, and I found out the last few times I called, no changes have been made to my disbursements, and the money did not go to my higher interest loans. 

According to what I was told, I owe 43% of my original amount of the 2.33% loans, 46% on 3 of my 6.8% loans, and 54% on my highest 6.8% loans. It's obvious all the extra money I've been putting in is going to lower interest loans, and I don't even know how to believe what I'm being told because I cannot see what I owe on each disbursement or the payment history on them. 

A supervisor I spoke with told me he will retroactively put all my extra payments towards my higher interest loans, which would reduce the amount of interest I've paid since the changes were not made when I have requested them the past few months. He said they would apply to ALL previous payments. I printed out the account information page and my payment history for reference (it shows amount paid on principle and interest for each payment). 

I don't believe that and think they can tell me anything since I cannot see the payment history on each disbursement. Is it legal to not make the disbursement option available for online payments? Do I have a legit complaint for the CFPB? I don't have recordings of previous conversations with the company requesting my higher interest loans receive the extra payments I've been making. 

Sorry for writing so much, thanks for your help.",finance,1428863128
investing,What the companies bond market tell you about these companies' share price?,"Take the oil sector for example. 

Since oil prices fell, oil stocks have been hammered!

But some have been more hammered than others because they are either indebted, has high operational costs or simply has a lack of funds to carry on as a going concern. 

Take oil producer Afren as an example. The shares are trading at 3p (down from 130p a year ago, a fall of 98%). 
Looking at Afren’s bond price that trades at 40 and 50 cents on the Dollar, ones need to understand the implications it will have on the shareholders. 
Shareholders’ of oil companies should ‘pay attention’ to the bond prices of the business because bondholders have first claimed on the company’s assets if they struggle to meet interest payments!!
If, the same oil businesses go bust, the bondholders will get first pick of its assets, and these guys usually get everything, leaving shareholders to rue their losses. 

As bond prices fall, yields on the bonds are going higher, this means three things: 
1. The higher yield means the oil assets are becoming less profitable, and risk of default is high;
2. Credit rating agencies like S&amp;P and Fitch will translate ‘higher’ yield to mean higher risk, by ‘downgrading’ oil producers’ creditworthiness. 
A downgrade means: 
Restrict easy access to external borrowings to oil producers meaning new money borrowed is at a higher interest rate. 
3. Lower bond prices should signal to shareholders that something is not right in the oil business.  
P.S. In a low oil price environment, oil producers are powerless because they’re price-takers, not price-setters. 
You can find Afren’s bond price in Morningstar, by clicking here: 
http://quicktake.morningstar.com/stocknet/bonds.aspx?symbol=afr&amp;country=gbr.
For the bond price of other companies go to the website called http://cbonds.com/ (subscription is needed). 

I will also want to add if these businesses are to be saved than the bond/debt will need to convert to equity, this means heavy dilution to current shareholders!!
For example, if: 
Company R has 200m shares in issue at a share price of 50p/share. It has debts of £300m and is struggling to keep up with interest. 
The value of the debt has dropped by 50%, meaning the debt market is valuing it at £150m. 
First, the company is working for the debt holders (bondholders/banks) because the ‘debt’ portion of the capital is three times as large as the ‘equity’ portion of the capital. 
P.S. Usually a sign telling you it is very risky to invest in its shares. 
As the company agrees to reach an agreement with the bondholders to convert debt into shares at 80% of the face value of the debt, meaning bondholders accept a loss of 20%, as the debt is valued at £240m. 
Calculations
Equity is £100m; Debt is £240m. 
The company will need to issue more than 2.4 times the current share issue, or 480m extra shares are giving a total of 680m shares. 
In order to maintain £100m market capitalisation, the share price needs to fall. 
That fall works out as £100m divided by 680m shares = 14.7 pence per share. Given that the company can negotiate off 20% of the debt value, reducing £60m of liabilities, it would be slightly higher than 14.7 pence/share, let’s make it 16 pence/share. 

The shareholders will see its value dropped by 68%. 

P.S. In the real world, these companies’ shares would drop first in anticipation of a future share dilution!!",finance,1428863538

My parents were planning on paying for my undergraduate tuition and housing for four years but they recently lost a lot of money because they had invested in oil companies. They're still offering to pay for my tuition but are implying that they'd prefer it if I handle all my expenses myself from now on. I'm almost 20 years old, I've got 950 dollars in savings and my parents would prefer it if I left the house by this summer. I own a motorcycle that is probably worth around 2,000$ and my dad offered to give me an old station wagon that still runs okay.

I'm wondering if there are any types of government assistance that homeless students qualify for and how I should go about changing my status from ""dependent on parents"" to ""homeless"" so that I can qualify myself. I've already started filling out a Federal Student Aid application, where it asked this question, ""On or after July 1, 2014, were you homeless or were you self-supporting and at risk of being homeless?"" I've been living with my parents since before July 1, 2014 but I will probably be living in my car after July of this year without any financial help from my family. Would it would be okay for me to write that I will be homeless if I'm technically not homeless yet? 

I know that I will be living near the poverty level but I'm okay with it.  I'm thinking about paying for a permit parking spot at my sister's apartment in Chicago and to just live in the station wagon in the parking lot for maybe a year until I've found a stable job and a cheap place to live, my sister said that I could come and crash on the couch if it got too cold outside but I think I'll be able to get by with a propane heater. So yeah, any advice/words of wisdom from you guys would be appreciated because I'm pretty scared and clueless at the moment.

personalfinance,8 years of poor choices + 1 crisis = a way out?,"First, thank you all. Three days ago my situation was really bleak looking. I've dug a hole for myself over the last 8 years, and a sudden car crisis ($3000 to fix) brought to me the brink. The collective genius of r/personalfinance has made my research a lot easier. 

Income: $2420/month (after taxes and a (very) small amount out for savings)
I cannot feasibly work another job.

Many of my expenses are non-negotiable, including:
Rent: $620/month
cable: $145/month
cell: $150/month (includes my family)
gas: $150/month (I must drive to work. Public transport is not an option 90% of the time.
food: $120/month

Debits:
Car loan: $4070 (on track to pay off May 2016) - paying $335/month
Federal Student Loans: $6146. Paying $180/month.
$1060 @ 2.33%
$5086.60 @ 6.8%
Credit Card: $8,300 (most at $12.99%, about $1500 @ 18.99%)

Credit: I have fair credit (FICO 673).

The Crisis: My car needs a some engine work to the tune of $3,000. Including a rental car (can't avoid that), total repair cost is $3200.
-Mechanic says the car is pretty good except for this. I think I can get several more years out of it (a 2009 with 117,000 miles)

Creditkarma.com and unbury.us were helpful to see that this is resolvable!

Please let me know your thoughts on my plan:
1. Apply for a 0 apr, 18 month card. Confirm 0%APR terms, then transfer $3000 of credit card balance.
-use this card for nothing else. Pay it down.
2. Apply for $5,000/36 month personal loan using prosper.com (8.7% apr...Rates are better than my bank).
a. Use $3200 to pay for current car crisis. 
b. Use $1000 to pay down old Credit Card further
c. Retain balance in savings to bulk up against future crisis' (savings are less than $1000 currently).

I can uncomfortably dedicate $1100 monthly to paying off the various debts. I've been paying about $800 in previous months. This leaves me a little money to deal with life each month..but not much.

The Plan (thanks to unbury.us): Small snowball, big avalanche
1. Pay off the smallest student loan for instant gratification ($151)
2. Go for the old Credit Card at $267/month (bump up when car loan is done)
3. Repay personal finance at $120 (bump up when old Credit Card is down)
4. Pay down the balance transfer/new Credit Card @ $200/month
5. Pay minimums on remaining student loans, car loan to term

If all goes well, this plan has me paying off all debts by April 2017.

I think I can stick with it. Do you think I can make any different choice? Any helpful advice?",finance,1428874130
personalfinance,I can never determine when it is worthwhile to pay down my HELOC. What am I missing?,"I bought a condominium about 10 years ago right before the housing market imploded.  In retrospect, perhaps I did everything wrong. . . I got a 5/1 ARM and HELOC to cover 90% of the total cost.  But I had done the math and knew I could afford the ARM after it adjusted based on my salary and would still have money to pay down the secondary loan.  For five years, I put a little towards my equity in the ARM but otherwise did not pay down the HELOC.  My plan was to move after 5 years anyhow.  All in all, I was going to pay mostly interest for 5 years (effectively rent).  But since I got an enormous tax break because of the interest deduction and I was confident the price would stay stable or go up, my math showed it was a cheaper way to live where I wanted to (Lower NYC) than renting.  

I was right.  The tax breaks were huge and the value of my apartment went up.  But in the five years between getting my ARM and having it convert, the entire housing crisis played itself out.  When it was time to convert, my interest rate ended up adjusting to something stupidly low. . .  far less than a fixed rate mortgage.  My financial position had also strengthened considerably.  So instead of selling the place, I kept it and rented it out.  I do not make much money on it, as I'm still paying off the mortgage.  But its value continues to go up and it costs me nothing to hold.  If I sold it, took the money, and invested it in something else with the same risk level, I would earn about as much.  

Now comes the question:  The HELOC is still there.  It's basically like a credit card charging me interest every month that I'm not paying off.  The APR on it is very low, less than 4%.  The return I can get on any money that I could use to pay the HELOC down is much greater than 4%.  So no matter how many spreadsheets and simulations I do, I still keep coming up with no scenario has me ever paying down this loan.  That seems very fundamentally wrong to me, but every time I crunch the numbers, it always seems better to invest than pay down.  Hence I have a loan that I will theoretically never pay off, so long as the interest rate stays where it is.

What am I missing?  There has to be some point where it would make sense to pay down this debt!

I am engaged, and we have a 1 year old.  He works 50-60 hours a week.   I'm still stay at home because daycare is outrageously expensive &amp; local jobs don't pay enough to offset childcare costs.   I have 2 college degrees once of which is in Nursing (R.N.).  But I don't care what the news says, the economy SUCKS at least in my part of the country.   Only places hiring are things like Walmart cashier or fast food.

The good news:  House has no mortgage!   All our cars are paid for - no loans.    My student loans are paid off.  And I try to live frugally.  Only one credit card carries a balance (about $10,000) because of the months where necessities such as car repairs happened and we just didn't have the money; interest rate 12%.    I do have excellent credit of close to 800, so refinancing the debt should be an option. 

Income: fiancee is paid $15.60/hour, does 50-60 hours per weeks, brings home *after taxes* maybe $700.  He's got excellent driving record and 10 years experience with a CDL Class B license, but the truth is companies just aren't paying much in my area and taxes are that high.   So let's say it's an average after taxes of $600/week = $31,200/year 

Assets:
House: $450,000 (I own / no liens)
Vehicles:  my Toyota econobox $5k, my Chevy pickup $6k, his Chevy suv $5k    (we are working on selling his SUV)

Expenses:

- Property taxes for the house $3,900/year

- Homeowners insurance $1,700/year

- Auto insurance $2,400/year between his policy and mine.  Insurance company won't let us combine things until married.  We both have excellent driving records.

- Food $300-400/month (??)

- Utilities:   Power  $200-$250/month,  Heat &amp; hotwater $300/month average*,     Water &amp; sewer = well is free,    Trash= I take to landfill myself for $6/visit  ....  monthly total about $500-550    (*Heat:  I turn thermostat back to 58-62F in winter and installed programmable thermostats but house is 2700 sq ft)  

- Phone:  no house phone.  Cell phones $200 total.

- Internet:  $45 (cheapest plan)

- TV:  no satellite or cable.   Netflix $8/month

- Minimal maintenance on house &amp; cars:  $2,000/year estimate

- Pets expenses-  cats, dog, 4 horses: food, shots, medical, etc:  $3,500/year.   (The horses aren't very marketable so they'd be hard to sell and it would devastate me to have them put down because of budget. This is the last thing I'll give up. I'd rather subsist on ramen noodles!)

- Household items, clothes &amp; shoes (thrift store or walmart), and other essentials: estimate $1,000/year

- Interest payments on the stupid credit card.  Currently about $100 each payment is interest and another $100-150 additional makes up minimum payment of $250/month

- Gas for him to get to work and me to run minimal errands: $100-150/month

- Savings and retirement:   we have nothing left to put in these accounts  (!!!)

- Child's expenses: clothes, formula, etc - currently my mother buys most of what baby needs.  But this isn't a way to live!?   estimate at $1000/year plus we want to put $ away for her for emergency or education, but we can't.  So right now is $0

- Health insurance: currently enrolled in Medicaid (free) but we may lose that now that he's working so many hours.   To buy health insurance through his employer, his contribution is $525.00 a month plus co-pays.   I'm budgeting $0 but don't know what will happen if we lose Medicaid eligibility.

Luxury expenses:

- dining out: no restaurants but we have been doing Chinese Take out 2-3x a month  = $100/month.  It's my only indulgence.

- cigarettes: I don't smoke.  He's at close to 2 packs a day, he says due to work stress.  $300-$350/month

- he sometimes grabs lunch at convenience store because he's driving 12 hour days.  I wouldn't do this, but I can't control what he does.   Let's say 1-2x a week @$10 visit = $100/month

- we stopped going to movies, stopped taking trips, don't go to shows, etc.   No vacations.  No nothing.   I don't buy jewelry, don't shop the mall, dont eat fast food, don't buy things for fun.  I buy my clothes used.  Furniture is older and bought secondhand.  I stopped going out with friends.  This is getting depressing.

- I do all our own lawn care, dog grooming,cleaning, housepainting, etc.  I try to fix as much as I can myself.  No manicures.  No spa days. Right now I have shaggy hair because I'd rather not spend the $25 right now.  No nothing we don't absolutely need.

- no money to open pool so I will leave it covered again this summer

Bottom line:
Take home pay $31,200/year + projected tax refund $5k-$6k  = about $36,200 

Expenses at least $37k (which doesn't pay down credit card)

And as soon as we start getting ahead something big &amp; unexpected happens.  For example water heater died and it's special order so it was $2,000 installed.   We have nothing in savings.  We have no retirement.   The tractor we depend on for snow removal for our long driveway &amp; mowing for big lawn is broken ($4000 repair or $20,000 to replace).   The Toyota failed emission this month and will need $800 to $1000 in repairs to pass.  The pickup has a power steering leak that ought to be fixed.   House/yard would benefit from a lot of fix up that isnt a necessity and not included in my estimates, but it looks crappy.  



PLEASE HELP!

Is selling this house to buy a less expensive house or move to area with lower expenses smart?    We're willing to leave this part of the state.   Friends say that North/South Carolina offer much better cost of living while still offering jobs near the cities.  To move I estimate $30,000+ in expenses (sales commission, closing costs on new house, truck rental)

If I put this house on market, is it worth it to put $ into making this house look nice?  And if so, how much?  House is 20 years old. Right now it's a bit shabby due to lack of $ for renovation.   Most buyers want pretty move-in ready houses.  But where will I get the $5 or $10k I'd expect it would cost to fix up issues I can't fix/repaint/clean myself?  But that puts me more in debt until this house sells, which may take 6-12 months.   Guesstimate is that it's worth $425-450k as is, and closer to $500k if it's in excellent cosmetic condition.  

Is it worth it to go to my credit union for a personal loan to pay off credit card, even know we're still hemorrhaging money and likely will keep using the credit card? 

He's is watching the help wanted ads for something better.  But we've found that the good paying jobs are the ones nobody quits.  

I browse ads to see if I can find something part time that would pay more than what childcare costs.  There isn't much, considering my schedule somewhat limited because of baby and his long hours.   I have a Registered Nurse license but nobody wants to hire someone  who can't work any shift they assign or work 10-12 hour shifts.

**tl;dr:  Family of 3. No debt except $10k on credit card.  Income estimated at $36k.  Barebones expenses at least $37k/year with no $ left for savings or retirement.  Plus facing some big expenses we ought to take care of. **",finance,1428894034

I'm trying to weigh multiple options with renting vs buying or paying off my smaller student loans--basically, I need help deciding which method would be best for me financially in the long run. We have been doing the ""rent-to-own"" thing with the house we currently live in, and have paid down to make the purchase price of this home to $88,000--a family member owns the house so this is not a scam or anything fishy. Rent is currently $725 a month, but a mortgage is going to be cheaper than this and especially since more of our payment is going towards our house instead of the property owner. We are already paying water/trash/sewage and half of the taxes ($800 a year), so our expenses don't really change minus adding the other half of taxes, PMI, and home owners insurance.

As of now, I'm on the income repayment plan solely because my private loan payments were getting hard to pay before I had a decent job. So, my payments on my Federal loans are $0 right now, but an adjustment period is coming up soon. I pay $400 a month scattered across all of them, even though I don't have to pay anything right now.

All of our credit cards are paid off right after we charge them, so the only other ""debt"" we have is a vehicle, which is at $14,500 right now and with payments of $266 a month.

Between us we make $1,500 week before taxes, so about $84,000 a year. As of right now we have $2,000 in our savings and $1,200 in our checking account. We also have a vehicle that is paid off and is worth $5,000 according to KBB.com

Our total monthly bills (TV, phones, car insurance, internet etc) come out to $2750 a month (this includes student loans).

So, would we qualify for a home or is my student loan debt too high even though we would be paying less with a mortgage and I've never missed a rent payment?",finance,1428927579

personalfinance,Dad offering to pay off student loans in exchange for me paying his car payments - downside?,"Hi PF, I have a question for you. I recently graduated in December with $28K in student loans from grad school (no undergrad debt - my parents paid for it). I've been paying it back since July and I have about $19K left at 5.41%.


Now, my dad is planning on buying a new car. He could buy it in cash, but they're offering 1.49% financing for him. So - he was planning on giving me the $19K to pay off my loans, and financing $19K of his car at 1.49%, and just having me make the payments. This would obviously make the interest rate low enough that it would make sense to only pay the minimums - making it possible for me to save more money every month towards retirement, and a down payment.


Are there any downsides that I'm not seeing in doing this? It makes sense from a financial standpoint for me - and there's not much of a downside for him, as he has the money to do it.

personalfinance,Should I claim allowances?,"Hello Reddit/PF

After reading another post about allowances I wanted to seek some help

Currently I have no allowances and get a nice tax refund but I read that is stupid because I am basically giving the government an interest free loan.  I went on the IRS website and it says I could be claiming 3 allowances to increase my take home pay and decrease my tax return.

I find it a lot easier to receive a tax return and invest that, then to save the extra money per pay check and invest that.

How much am I losing with that mindset? If I claimed 3 allowances and invested that every paycheck (into S&amp;P500) vs doing what I do now, how much work can than extra cash do for me throughout the year?

Currently married filing jointly,

I make about 60k and my wife makes about 8k for her part time job.

About 2306.92 every two weeks before taxes.

Also about 645 come out every paycheck before taxes for 401k and health insurance.

personalfinance,"Taxes done, rental properties and owe more than expected!","Hello PF, 

The wife and I completed our taxes last week and we owe a lot more money than we were assuming. We owe about 5300 to the Feds and 2300 to Oregon. We are seeing a CPA today but wanted to get some ideas on what you guys think.

I make about 60,000 claiming myself only and my wife makes about 73,000. She mistakenly claimed 3 for federal and 1 for state. She contributes to a 401k and carries our health insurance which cost us 3900.00. We paid so much in tax last year -- 26,800!!!

We own a rental property, which we are taking about a 240 dollar loss on every month, meaning rents paid do not equal the mortgage. The total ""income"" for the rental was 11,700.00 this included management fees, which has been deducted. After depreciating our property 25 years straight line, deducting interest and taxes, the total was about 9300.00. As a result our AGI was about 141,000. The property has been in service as a rental since 2012 and last year was the first year that the home was depreciated as rental income.

Unfortunately (fortunately?) we are married without kids and for our primary residence we rent because where we live the cost of property is ridiculous. We both had some student loan interest deducted but that did not make much of a difference. We also had some medical expenses but the expenses did not meet 10% of our income to itemize them. 

We have no more available deductions regarding our rental property as its in another city and our management company does everything needed.
 
We understand the mistake with my wife's W4 has definitely impacted what we owe but could this mistake really cost us 8k? Is it between this mistake and the ""extra income"" for rents received that we owe so much? Quite honestly our rental property is a hardship and due to the market we don't have enough equity to refinance, I don't fully understand why a rental property is considered income when it is at a loss. Should we depreciate the house differently? 

Can our health insurance premiums be deducted?

How do we prevent this next year, other than changing our withholdings? File separately? Make an LLC? Anything??

I was under the impression (I could be wrong, in fact I may be wrong) that if you don't get a federal tax return then you don't have to pay the penalty for not having healthcare.

gaming,Feedback to a recently linked article about dlc weapons killing TLOU multiplayer from a more experienced player,"Last week someone linked an article in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/31o22l/the_last_of_us_multiplayer_dlc_is_not_okay/) and I would like to give some feedback about that.

Note that I am playing the game a lot and like it very much, but please don't dismiss me as a fanboy because of that and hear me out.

I will not try to argue against anyone's standpoint that all weapons and perks should be unlockables, although I am actually indifferent about that. I buy those things and am happy that ND supports this game. I will not argue against that though, as it is a valid point.

The issue with that articel is that it claims the dlc weapons and perks give players advantages, painting the picture of it being pay-to-win. Many commenters backed that up here. That is just plain wrong. From an experienced player's point of view that article is embarrasing and sounds like a rant of some kid who got killed too much and who tries to blame it on something.

&gt;the new guns and perks are often better than the base game counterparts.

couldn't be farther from the truth.

&gt; The Frontier Rifle sits in between the Semi-Auto Rifle and the Hunting Rifle in terms of damage and fire rate; it takes two shots to down where the Semi-Auto takes three and it has a better fire rate than the Hunting Rifle. There are benefits to the default weapons. The Hunting Rifle can one-hit a full health enemy with a headshot where the Frontier Rifle cannot. The Semi-Auto Rifle can get three shots off before the Frontier Rifle can get two. However, comparing only body shots, the Frontier Rifle beats out the Hunting Rifle in fire rate. Taking recoil and staggering of a face-to-face encounter into account, it is often easier to land two shots with the Frontier Rifle than to land three shots with the Semi-Auto.

This is where I stopped reading the first time I saw that article. There are 3 weapons mainly used competively. The Burst Rifle, the Hunting Rifle (only in the right hands) and The Semi Auto Rifle. In this section the author compares the Frontier Rifle to two of those, claiming it beats them. From someone who plays the game regularly this is a ridiculous claim. On same skill level the Semi Auto beats the Frontier 99% of the time as the described 3 shots will land much earlier than the 2 from the Frontier. Add to that the fact that the FR needs to reload in between which causes the reticle to go away and you have to aim again, which makes it much more difficult to stay on target than with the Semi with which you can just spam the trigger with a reticle that is always there. The author even accounts the FR's head-to-head advantage to the staggering effect. Even without knowing about the fact that the Semi is known to be one of the biggest culprists for *causing* strong and consistant staggering effect, it should be common sense to realize that a weapon which needs to reload bewteen shots will cause less staggering than a semi automatic with fast fire rate. The Semi wins a bodyshot battle and even more so in a headshot battle. Semi downs with one headshot and one bodyshot. The Frontier also downs with one headshot and one bodyshot. Remember: The Semi has a much better rate of fire and it's easier to stay on target. 

I hope you can understand why his claims sound ridiculous.

He is right about a bodyshot battle between the Hunting Rifle and the Frontier in certain ranges. In closer than long range it will probably have the advantage. This is called balancing, since the scoped HR is designed for sniping. In long range I'd say the HR has the advantage. Also most snipers go for headshots, which makes this weapon a beast in the right hands.

The frontier recently even got a buff because it was belittled. The community actually thinks it didn't need the buff as it was in a good place and can also be a strong weapon in the right hands. The notable buff is that the ingame upgrade parts-costs got decreased. Parts can be earned and spent in an individual game according to your performance. The upgrade cost now equal those of the earlier mentioned Burst Rifle. The King of all weapons. The one that rules them all. The one 90% of players use in a competitve setting. That one weapon the community wants to get nerfed. The one that comes with the game. 

The articel goes on like this:

&gt; The Tactical Shotgun exists in a similar space as the Frontier Rifle. It isn't unequivocally better than the comparable base game weapons, but it enjoys some advantages. The most obvious benefit it has over the Shotgun and the Double Barrel is increased range, able to down in two shots from a range that either of the others would fumble to do anything worthwhile. Less apparent is that it can be equipped as a starting weapon where the other long shotguns are both ""purchaseables,"" only attainable during a match after scoring enough points. Embedded in that purchase is the opportunity cost of not saving up for ammunition, weapon upgrades, or armor.

The tacticle shotgun is actually a weapon that can give someone with bad aim better results. It has a wide spread (smaller than the other 3 shotguns of which 2 come with the game) and is medium range. So if you struggle to hit targets in midrange with other weapons, this weapon will help you getting better results. However, besides one core weapon, all others will still beat it and your better results will not put you in a commanding position against most players. It has it's advantages in certain situations and against certain players. And that is what every other weapon in the game does. It's countered easily too.

&gt; However, the most egregious offender in the Tactical Weapons pack is the Crossbow. It's difficult to measure the advantage it gives because there is no other comparable weapon. It fires silently like the Bow but doesn't arc. Nominally, it can down in two shots, but it has a special ability that makes it absurdly powerful in some situations. After hitting an enemy with it, that enemy will bleed until he heals or is downed. This also lets the shooter see where the target is and what he's doing during that time period.

&gt; In effect, it can be a delayed one-hit kill. If the target has no health kit, he's toast. If he has a health kit and he starts healing, the Crossbow user can see the opening and move in for a sidearm or melee kill. Even if the target isn't downed, it still takes him out of the fight for a brief period of time as he retreats and heals. All from a single, silent shot.

When I came back to this article and read this I didn't know if I should laugh or cry. This is the exact reaction some people had crying that the bleed out is OP. A few days later people stopped and realized that it isn't remotely as strong. Yes, it is unique. But nowhere as threatening as the author claims. It is so easy to heal up in this game. And his description of a player who finds cover to heal up and how you can follow him and kfinish him? That's what you do with every other weapon in the game. The hit opponent is hurt and tries to heal up quickly. You hunt him down and try to kill him, before he does so. The bleed out doesn't change much with that. In 100 games I see maybe 1 crossbow. Trust me, if something is OP or close to OP you will see it more often than that. It is a fun weapon people use to mess around with a little.

To conclude the weapons part: The strongest weapons are the Semi, the Burst, the Hunting Rifle and the Ingame shop purchasables: Shotgun and El Diablo. All of these are core game weapons. The only dlc weapons that come close to these are the Variable Rifle and the sidearm Enforcer and some players will use these effectively in competitve matches.

The Variable is like a slightly faster Semi with optional zoom, which takes 1 more shot to down and the Enforcer is like sidearm version of that without zoom. It sits between the the slower 3 shot down Revolver and the faster 5 shot down 9 milly.  Experiened players mostly choose the 9 milly for it's higher potential (kills with as many headshots as the others, but faster) and the fact it costs 0 loadout points, whereas the Enforcer costs 1. For those who don't know: Creating yor class you have 13 loadout points available to you and the weapons and perks cost different amounts. This is another way of balancing things out. Using the tacticle shotgun for example costs 3 LP whereas any other unsilenced large firearm costs 2. The perks, according to their potential have different LP costs. 

Speaking of perks: Besides maybe two perks non of the dlc-perks are stronger than the standard set. Yes, it is fun to play with those and it opens you different ways of playing the game. You can try out other styles and different gameplay. But they don't give you an advantage over someone who doesn't use those. Again, if you are going try-hard, you will stick with the standard perks. Two, which I can argue about: Bomb expert 3, which gives you an advantage many people hate on. But it costs the highest amount of LP, meaning you have to cut other things short. And maybe scavanger, which lets you loot more ammo from killed players. Also not a cheap perk. Out of the numerous dlc perks these two *may* find their way into your try-hard class, but they even usually don't, as they are arguably still beaten by standard perks.

It is really frustrating to see how this article with misleading information got spread all around every possible forum by the same guy and seeing the positive feedback by players who don't have enough experience. Balance whining comes before the actual understanding about the game most of the times.

Again, this is not against anyone's general stance towards dlc. It's about a blatant balance whine filled with lies.",technology,1428944195

personalfinance,I have a totalled car that I still owe money on... help?,"I have a used vehicle that I took a loan out for 1 years ago. It was a tiny loan (3k), but the interest rate is absurd (13% APR). The loan and my insurance are both through the same company (USAA).

In late 2014, I was having some financial problems and decided to cut my spending back as much as possible. I went into my auto insurance and turned everything off that it would allow me to. I was operating under the impression that it would not allow me to turn off full coverage insurance, which is what the software is designed to do. Somehow it did.

I just totalled the vehicle. My insurance can't figure out how I managed to turn off full coverage insurance, but they say I wasn't paying for it, so I am SOL.

I still owe 2500 on the car, and I have about 800/month in money left over. Unfortunately, I really need to get a new vehicle. I can't keep depending on my coworkers for rides. That will cut my left over money down to about 500/month. Meanwhile, the wrecked car is sitting in my apartment complex, and it's going to get towed eventually.

personalfinance,Detailed Introduction to Credit Card Basics,"I wanted to write a detailed explanation of some important credit card basics for beginners as quite often in this subreddit I see questions related to this topic. In addition, the section in the wiki on how credit cards work is just a short paragraph.   
The information in this guide comes from my previous experience working at a major credit card issuer, my own research online, and my experience in opening, closing, and keeping many credit card accounts. Think of this as a glossary of some of the most essential terms and language found with many credit card accounts. This post will strictly be about how these apply to U.S.-issued credit cards that run on the major networks. Store-issued credit cards are more complicated; they often have many more restrictions and fees or other conditions that are not going to be covered in this post.   
*As always, there will be exceptions to all the details below, but they will apply in* ***most*** *cases.*  
 
**Revolving Credit** 
 
Credit Cards are an example of revolving credit. The definition of revolving credit is a type of credit that does not have a fixed amount of payments. Typically revolving credit has a pre-fixed limit, which is borrowed against. The borrower makes payments based on how much is borrowed, and has the flexibility to pay at once or over time. This is different than installment credit, which has a fixed number of payments over time, with payments amortized to cover the amount borrowed. A home loan or auto loan is a form of installment credit.  
 
**Issuer vs Network** 
 
The bank that lends you credit and provides you with a credit card is the issuer. This is whom you send your  payments to. Examples include Chase, Citi, and US Bank. When you swipe a card, these payments are processed on networks. There are four major credit networks in the U.S.; Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. Visa and MasterCard are not credit card companies; instead they are payment processors. Even debit cards need a network to be used. Every card will have their associated network's logo on either the front or back. American Express and Discover are unique in that they both issue you the credit as well as process the payment each time you use their cards. 
 
**How Credit Issuers Make Money** 
 
Every time a card is used as a payment method, there are fees that the issuer and network charge.  
Let's say you buy a sandwich at your local deli. You decide to pay with your Chase credit card that runs on the Visa network. For simplicity, it's a very expensive $100 sandwich. In this example there are ~~4~~ 3 parties involved.   
* Consumer: You   
* Merchant: Deli   
* Issuer: Chase   
~~* Network: Visa~~  
For the $100 sandwich, the issuer will charge 2%, or $2. This is called the interchange. The interchange is taken as profit by the issuer and is then used for marketing costs, cash back rewards, or other operational expenses. ~~The network will charge 0.5%, or $0.50. This is called the acquiring fee. The acquiring fee is taken as profit by the network so they can use the money to improve the payment networks, payment security, and develop new technologies.~~ In the end, the merchant will receive ~~$97.50~~ $98, which is immediately paid to them by the issuer, Chase. Chase then bills you for the $100 you spent. Must've been a darn good sandwich! 
 
This is a simplified version of what occurs with each credit card transaction. The whole process is called the 'payment value chain', and more information can be found online. Payment processing is now changing with the introduction alternate methods of payments, for example, mobile.  
**EDIT:** In this example I removed the network from the payment chain. This is due to incorrect information regarding the network and another party I did not include, the acquiring bank. I don't have a great way to simplify the process in regards to the network and acquirer, so it is best to be left out.   
 
**Statement Balance vs Current Balance** 
 
When you login to your online bank account to view your credit card details, you are often presented with both a statement balance and a current balance. Like other bills, banks will generate a statement at the end of each billing cycle for all charges that occurred during that cycle. Usually this is 4 weeks or 30 days long, for example; Jan 2 to Feb 1. In this case, the statement close date is Feb 1. When the bank sends your statement with the balance, the statement balance is the sum of all charges and adjustments that occurred over the 30 days between Jan 2 and Feb 1. Note that the statement close date will depend on when your account was opened. 
 
Let's assume that you check your account a few days after statement close. If you login to your account on Feb 7, you will see your statement balance as well as a current balance. The current balance is the sum of all charges and adjustments that remain unsettled (or unpaid), including your statement balance. If you made purchases between Feb 1 and Feb 7, your current balance will include your statement balance plus all the recent charges. If you had already paid off your statement balance by the time you login and check, the current balance will only reflect the recent charges.   
 
**Understanding APR and Minimum Payments** 
 
Credit card debt is unsecured debt, which means there is no underlying asset backing the loan. In general, the interest rates on unsecured debt are higher than secured debt. An example of secured debt is a home mortgage. If a borrower defaults on secured debt, the bank can foreclose and take possession of the house or property, which holds value. In the case of a credit card, the bank cannot seize any asset and is therefore left with the entire balance as a loss if the borrower defaults.  
 
This is primarily the reason why the interest rates on credit cards are so high compared to other forms of loans. The banks need to protect themselves against potentially high losses in case borrowers do default.  
 
Fortunately, many credit cards come with a grace period where no interest is charged. This is usually 1 month, or 30 days after statement close, with a minimum of 21 days. The date that the grace period ends is your payment due date, and the day interest begins to accrue on any unpaid balances from the last statement.  
 
There are usually 3 types of interest charges on a credit card account, and those 3 are for   
* Purchases: Goods and services you pay for with the card.   
* Cash Advances: You can use your card to get cash from an ATM or bank.  More information about cash advances in the next section.  
* Balance Transfers: Balance you transfer from another account. More information about balance transfers in the next section.   
The interest rates are different for all these types of transactions. In your statement, there will be a section that summarizes the interest rate for each group, and the sum of all balances that these interest rates apply to. 
 
The minimum payment due is usually $25 or some percentage of your previous statement balance. It is especially dangerous to pay only the minimum every month. Any unpaid balances will begin to accrue interest after the grace period is up, and at an interest rate of at least 15% in most cases.  In addition, if there are any balances that are unpaid after the payment due date, many cards will also remove the grace period for future billing cycles. This means that not only is your previous balance accruing interest, but any new purchases you make as well will immediately start accruing interest once the charge is posted, not after the payment due date.  
 
**How interest is calculated** 
 
There are 2 main methods creditors use to calculate monthly interest charges. They are the daily balance method and the average daily balance method. The difference is the balance used in each case.  
 
As the name suggests, daily balance method depends on the actual balance on each day of the billing cycle. Since this is daily, the rate applied is 1/365 of the APR. Daily interest charges are calculated by multiplying the balance at the end of each day by the daily rate. In this scenario, it is advantageous to pay off outstanding balance as quickly as possible. Doing so reduces the daily balance so that the interest charges are less as the balance is less.  
 
The average daily balance method sums up all the balances each day in a billing period, then divides by the number of days in the billing period. A rate of 1/365 is then applied to the average daily balance to calculate the daily interest charge. ~~In this scenario, it does not matter how quickly outstanding balance is paid off.~~  
 
~~Not surprisingly, most credit cards will charge interest based on the average daily balance method, as it is more profitable in the end.~~  
 
**Balance Transfers and Cash Advances** 
 
Credit cards also usually provide 2 additional benefits; balance transfers and cash advances.  
 
Balance Transfers allow you the ability to transfer debt from another account to your credit card, provided you have the credit line to support it and it falls under the balance transfer maximum amount. In many instances, credit card companies will offer discounted APR rates for a certain number of billing cycles in order to incentivize this service. However, these transfers are usually not without a service fee, either a flat fee or a percentage of the balance transferred. Balance transfers can be a useful way to consolidate debt if the discounted APR is 0% or even much lower than the rate on other debt. Beware though, as having a balance transfer on your account will result in you forfeiting the purchase grace period unless a 0% APR on purchases is on your account at the same time.  
 
Cash Advances are the ability to withdraw cash from any ATM. This service should only be used for emergencies, as the fees are extraordinary. The cash advance APR can be well over 20%, and interest begins accumulating immediately. There is no grace period for cash advances. In addition, the credit card charges you a cash advance fee, either flat or a percentage of the cash amount. And finally, the ATM may also charge a fee based on out-of-network usage.  
 
**Summary** 
 
If I had to summarize credit cards in a short paragraph, here is how I would do it.    
Credit cards are very short-term loans with incredibly high interest rates. If used properly and responsibly, credit cards will cost you nothing in finance and interest charges and provide a wealth of benefits.    
Hopefully this post has given most of you an idea of the basics of credit cards, especially some of the more confusing points such as interest charges and the balance definitions.",finance,1428951371

personalfinance,"32 y/o M still fighting way out of student loan debt, looking for general advice.","I've been battling my way out of debt since I graduated a decade ago.  I started with about $80k in debt and a useless degree (Communications).  Fun times.    
My debt situation right now...    
* Loan 1 (private, variable rate): $29,993 @ 3.72%    
* Loan 2 (gov't, fixed rate): $6,869 @ 2.85%    
* Car Loan: $13,160 @ 3.99%    

So that's right around an even $50k in debt.  I have excellent credit, it was 780 the last time I checked it.  Not sure how relevant that is at the moment.      

Currently I make $76k a year in IT.  I'm putting as much money as possible towards the bigger loan with the variable rate.  When I graduated, before the economy went in the toilet, that interest rate was nearly 8%.  I also couldn't find a decent job and was stuck between $28-$40k salary until I was 28.  I got destroyed for a few years on that interest rate.  Thankfully it's been somewhat reasonable since 2008.        

Nowadays I'm able to put between $1,000-$1,500 at it per month and my goal is to have it paid off by the end of 2017 (I also put all bonuses and tax returns towards it).  The small loan is a minor nuisance, the minimum payment is $38.  I'm paying the minimum on the auto loan.      

So while it's nice that I'm finally at least putting in a dent in my massive loan I'm still panicked/depressed that I'm turning 33 this year and have no retirement, no emergency fund, no savings towards a down payment on a home, etc.  Every spare penny goes towards my loans.      

My fiance, who's seven years younger than me, makes $30k annually and has less than $5k in debt (student loans).  She has about $10k in savings and just started a 401k at her first full-time job.     
 
The good news is that neither of us are big spenders, we don't go on vacation and in generally seem to be handling my crappy situation about as well as possible.      

Moving forward, what's our best plan?  Should I start saving a little towards retirement, even if it's only $100/mo, and put a little less towards my loan?  Should I keep focusing on my loans and not start retiring until I'm 35-36 y/o?  I work for a small IT consulting firm who offers no retirement benefits.  Should I look into an IRA?  Also, my fiance is willing to be a team player with her savings and if the right move is to put that $10k towards my loans then she would.  I'd rather have her keep on saving towards a house (or whatever) and let me take care of my loans.  The thought of us as a couple having nearly nothing in savings is a frightening thought.

personalfinance,"Leasing a car, Time value of money","Hey guys, let me first say that i love this subreddit. It is full of useful knowledge and tips on finance that i find very valuable. 

I really like the new KIA optima and i want to purchase it on a 36 month lease. I have done the research and before anyone tries to talk me out of a lease, I've decided that it is the right fit for my financial situation. With that being said, i don't really need the car. Let me explain..

I currently drive a 2004 Trail Blazer with almost 99,000 miles on it. It is in fantastic condition and I only purchased it for $4000. There is nothing wrong with it, other than its a little out dated. It gets me from A to B with no problem what so ever. I know the cheapest way to go about this matter would be to keep my Trail Blazer and drive it until I'm out of college (i have one year left) or until it dies. But i would like to capitalize on the low milage of the vehicle and sell it while the value is up. The more i drive it, the less it is worth. I figure with the KBB at 5300 and my selling skills, i can sell it for close to $7000 if i really pitch the value (low miles, new tires, proof of all maintenance). 

Now onto the lease...

I have been looking at cars around $25000-$30000 and narrowed it down to the KIA optima. After going to the dealership i got some useful information. I played dumb at first to try and see how honest they were. They tried to play the whole game ""your payment will be X and your downpayment will be X"". Without showing me any of the fees, interest rates etc. After some brief talking i told them that this will not cut it. I told them if they want to do any business with me, i need to see a breakdown of all the fees. Licensing fees, acquisition fees, interest rates, i wanted it all. At first they told me they could not provide that, but when i got up to leave they had the finance guy come over and try to explain some of the fine print. We started talking about the ""money factor"" which i interpreted as the interest rate. They told me it depends on my tier of credit (i have a 625 score). 

Some questions from you guys.

1. Would you try and sell the car to capitalize on the value?
2. What are some things i should look for when talking money with my salesman?
3. What are some things i should ask my salesman?
4. Is the money factor the same as the interest rate?
5. Would it be foolish to walk in and demand what i want? And if they can't make it happen, leave? For instance, ""Im not going to put any money down, I want this car for $300 a month, licensing and zero fees out the door. Can you make this happen?""",finance,1428957528

I also have a car loan I owe about $9000 on it an plan on paying it off in two years. Its a nice 2008 Honda Accord V6 so it will last me for a while. I have a couple of credit cards with no debt on them and a 750 credit score. 

My plan is to open a discover savings account that offers a 0.90% interest rate. Hopefully be able to contribute $200 a month and according to their online calculator I should have around $25k in 10 years. Then I would buy a $150k house which is decent in my area hopefully give a $30k down payment. A 15 year loan would only be like $880 a month and have a house fully paid off by the time I'm 45.  

I know things could change but for now how does this plan sound? 
Any feedback good or back will be appreciated.

personalfinance,father passed unexpectedly; help me with mortgage/prime equity line,"hello guys, throwaway for obvious reasons
my father passed unexpectedly and left my mother a house. house valued at ~625k (bought at around 500k), they planned on selling it next year. she still wants to sell the house and move into a smaller home.

the question i have is the mortgage. theres about 280k left to pay off at 3.8% interest and there is a prime equity line open at around 85k at 4.5% interest.

my mom will be expecting a fairly large sum of money from my father's death benefits (~500k).

1) bank thinks we should consolidate the mortgage and prime equity line at a roughly the same interest rate as the mortgage (3.8%). should we do this, knowing we will sell the house next year?

2.) my father was paying off about $2800/month of the mortgage. he was paying off just the interest of the prime equity line per month, roughly $280/month. was there a specific method to this payment because he planned on selling the house?

any help would be appreciated",finance,1428958760

investing,What Fundamentals Affect Commodity Prices,"Good morning! Today Troy continues with the investing for beginners series. You can check the previous posts about What are stocks and how to value them, How does Currency Trading Work, How are Currencies Traded, Investing in Commodities

In the previous post I explained the basics of commodity investing. In this post, I’m going to explain exactly what fundamental factors affect commodity prices.

A Precursor
Commodity prices tend to rise and fall together, much like how stock prices rise and fall together. As the saying goes, “a rising tide lifts all boats”. If the entire U.S. economy is doing well, generally all stocks will go up. The fundamentals below impact all commodity prices.

Inflation
Inflation is a huge factor that can impact commodity prices. Thanks to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, all commodities are officially listed in U.S. dollars. Here are two important terms that you need to know

Nominal value
Real value
The nominal value of a commodity is the “official price”. If gold per ounce is at $1300 right now, then the nominal value is $1300. If inflation is 100% (a hypothetical scenario), then the nominal value of gold will also increase by 100%, doubling to $2600 per ounce.

The real value of a commodity takes into account for inflation. Let’s assume that gold is at $1300 an ounce. If inflation increases by 100%, the nominal value will increase, but the real value is exactly the same. There’s just more U.S. dollars chasing after the same amount of gold in this world!

As investors, we only care about the nominal value. Thus, when inflation picks up, commodity prices soar across the board! This is what happened in Germany with hyperinflation in the 1930’s – a loaf of bread cost a bajillion Marks (Germany’s currency at the time) to buy. The real value didn’t change (a loaf of bread is still a loaf of bread), but the nominal value exploded.

This is what happened in the U.S. during the 1970s (although it wasn’t as severe as it was in Germany). U.S. inflation skyrocked (14% per year), and commodity price spiked in the 1970s. Gold went from $30 an ounce to $600 an ounce.

Right now, we are seeing the early phases of inflation where inflation will pick up but has not started yet. Ben Bernake (Chairman of the Federal Reserve) has a genius solution to America’s economic woes – print money! That’s essentially the name of the game for his consecutive rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE). Sooner or later, this money printing is going to catch up to him (or us American taxpayers, actually) with huge inflation. And what happens when inflation hits? Commodity prices skyrocket.

Increased Demand, Decreased Supply
There is a fixed amount of supply in this world – it’s not like we can manufacture gold (alchemy!) or copper. On the other hand, demand is increasing exponentially. Can you imagine if every person in the world lived the way us Americans did! Considering the amount of stuff we waste each year (that’s how my relatives from Europe put it), the world’s resources would be depleted in a heart beat.

With developing nations increasing their standards of living, the world’s demand for raw materials such as oil and copper is outstripping supply. The Chinese are a huge buying force in the world – they are rebuilding their country after:

1800s: Britain literally robs China of all its gold and silver by drugging the entire nation with Opium (prior to the 1800s, drugs didn’t exist in China). It’s called The Century of Humiliation. China went from #1 in the world (literally, the “Middle Kingdom”) to dead last.
Early 1900s: Chinese Civil War
1950 – 1978: the Communist fiasco (Chairman Mao ruined China).
So really, China’s literally been rebuilding its entire country over the past 30 years. And because China is so big (both geographically and population wise), China consumes a ton of resources.

This trend in increasing demand and shrinking supply is only going to continue, thereby pushing up commodity prices. Factor in some more inflation thanks to King Bernake from the Federal Reserve, and you have the perfect set up for a long term bull market in commodities.

Thanks for reading! As I side note, I have something for y’all bloggers out there (and no, this is not an ad or a promotional gimmick). I’m trying out a new blogging software called Ghost for my site TradingSlugger.com. I like Ghost so much that I built a blog all about Ghost for beginners.

personalfinance,Pay off current house or buy a different one later?,"Basically, my husband and I are buying our current home. It's 3 bd. 1 ba, on 1.2 acres. We got a smallish windfall and we can completely pay off the remainder balance on our house and even have a little left over. The interest rate is fairly high, it was an owner finance and long story short: we were desperate at that time and we took it.   
  
  
 

We can also buy the 3 +/- acres next to us, for an undetermined amount of money, this would not be paid in full. I mention this land because we want/need more land and when we get another property it will have considerable more land. 
  
 

If you were in this situation would you pay off your current house? Or look to buy more acreage in another year or so? Technically, we would have a nice down payment for a different property, but my credit score is non existent as I'm working on building it up, and his is bad.  
  
 

The problem with our current home (this is relevant) it's in a horrible neighborhood. Two houses have been shot at, one directly in front of us and the other one is two houses down, just in the last 4 months. One of those houses are getting evicted on the 20th of this month though. We're never had any issues directly besides the neighbors dogs and kids coming on our property and screwing with our dogs. Throwing things at him etc.  
  
 

I would also like to add: It's not exactly a place where it is easy to sell houses, it's far easier to rent. But that is a slightly different topic. If we did get another place, I'm confident we could rent. We could also pay both mortgages, while not ideal, wouldn't be a problem.

Bitcoin,My Argument for Bitcoin vs Gold,"The [bitcoin vs gold debate](https://diginomics.com/bitcoin-vs-gold) has raged on in investment circles since bitcoin has entered mainstream discussion among increasingly interested investors. Gold has been used as a form of currency and trade for thousands of years, and certainly has a track record for reliability and preservation of wealth. However, as the newcomer onto the scene, bitcoin may be the kind of financial and technological breakthrough to to challenge gold as the monetary kingpin.

Early on in its life cycle, seasoned investors began questioning the legitimacy of bitcoin value and debating how such a commodity could hold intrinsic value. What differentiates bitcoin from a mere collectible and what makes it similar to precious metal assets such as gold or silver? Among many circles, especially gold bugs and older-generation investors, bitcoin was not considered a valid investment up until very recently. Which factors of bitcoin instil this *validity of investment*?

In order to properly analyse the value of bitcoin vs gold, we must clarify which attributes of gold are valuable and prop them up against the promise of bitcoin. When we measure the implications of today’s economic environment, it is clear to see why bitcoin is being considered the ‘gold of the 21st century’, or as some pundits have advocated, a *‘digital gold’*.

**BITCOIN VS GOLD**

Gold has perceived value because it is scarce, quasi-indestructible, and serves an industrial purpose. Bitcoin inherits all of these attributes and also adds the characteristics of portability and perfect divisibility. Both are also exceedingly durable and cannot be counterfeit. The main advantage for bitcoin over gold as a commodity is that bitcoin has perfect portability, while gold must be insured, physical stored and guarded, and verified that the integrity of the substance has remained intact and not mixed with other filler metals such as tungsten. If you are moving precious metals across borders, you must declare it. *No amount of border authorities or cash sniffing dogs can detect you holding bitcoin*, as ownership can be distilled to memorizing a private key which controls the associated wallet. If you are attempting to buy something with gold, it usually needs to be exchanged for currency first. Bitcoin payments **need only a smartphone to transact**.

One of the main reasons to add gold to an investor’s portfolio today is as a hedge against economics disaster, that of collapse or hyperinflation. Outside the gold-bug crowd, and among the current generation, gold as a valid form of transaction is a stretch of the imagination. If such an event were to occur, **would people be exchanging in pieces of gold if internet connectivity were still available**? At the blurring rate of current technological advancements, would considering a shiny metal to be valuable seem like an increasing trend?

Gold may have been reliable in the 20th century, but among a generation of digital natives, who are connected psychologically *(and soon to be physically)* to their mobile devices, bitcoin will increasingly be the method of choice for commerce. This is the information age, and in it, information represents the most valuable form of commodity. Bitcoin is financial information stored on a collective, distributed computing network.

In terms of commodity fungibility, having one unit exactly similar to all others is important. With bitcoin, this is guaranteed by cryptographic algorithms, yet every coin carries with it the *entirety of its transaction history*. With gold, this is also not simple. Metals can carry dilutions and value estimates can differ depending on the mint which issued the coin or bar. We also know that the benchmark used by investors and central bankers to determine the value of precious metals has been (and continues to be) **heavily manipulated**. According to Bloomberg, authorities around the world are already investigating the manipulation of benchmarks from interest rates to foreign exchange, and examining the $20 trillion gold market for signs of wrongdoing.

With bitcoin, network integrity can be cryptographically proven, representing a digital asset which has transcended physicality and operates within the cyber dimension. It’s very possible to send millions of USD worth of bitcoin within seconds and only the sender and receiver are aware of the identities involved. Physical actors cannot exert control over the portability of this commodity, and therefore, *‘digital gold’* represents bitcoin accurately.

Gold is a store of value which relies on tradition to support its value base along with a few minor industrial purposes. When you take away this perceived tradition of value you are left with a few manufacturing uses and nothing more. Tradition has built an idea in the consumers mind that gold and silver hold tremendous intrinsic value. It could be argued that the valuations behind precious metals is artificially high due to a market perception which has vastly underestimated the quantity of these metals.

Despite what a merchant may tell you, **we have no clear idea on the supply of gold**. We have barely begun to explore the depths of the ocean let alone mine deeper than a scratch in the Earth’s crust. Who is to say how much gold and precious minerals near-Earth asteroids contain? It’s possible that gold’s perceived scarcity may prove to be illusory in 20-30 years when private enterprise is mining rocks in space.

**THE VERDICT**

The fact that bitcoin is instantly transferable across the globe with no need to identify the parties involved, is why it holds a tremendous advantage over precious metals. Bitcoin, and other developments in cryptocurrency, will challenge precious metals as history’s de-facto store of wealth.",cryptocurrency,1428977671

personalfinance,Consolidating student loans,"I know there are a million questions regarding student loans but here are some more. I graduated last summer and make $42,000/year (in a low cost of living area) as a software developer (I plan on being able to make a good bit more within a year or two). I currently have about an $80,000 balance on all of my student loans combined (about $50,000 is federal, $30,000 private from 2 lenders). Included in that $50,000 federal is a parent plus loan signed by my mom for about $10,000. Here come some questions:


1. I tried using sofi.com to see if I would be eligible to consolidate all of these loans together but was denied (I believe my credit is decent, I just don't think I make enough currently). If I could get a co-signer (not my mom), what other financial institutes could I check to see if they will accept the consolidation (I tried using credible.com but I keep getting errors when trying to import my loans and I don't know how to manually enter my federal loans).
2. One of the main reasons for doing this now is due to my mom's name being on some of the loans (she cosigned for some of my private loans and she has the Parent Plus loan in her name) and it needs to be removed since she is in the process of buying a house (her loan is contingent on her name being removed). Will I be able to ""take her name off"", especially with the Parent Plus loan and transfer it all to me? If so, how?
3. Is there a better solution to all of this rather than lumping all my loans together (both federal and private)? Like, should I consolidate all of my federal loans together (so as to take my mom's name off the Parent Plus loan) and then consolidate all of my private loans?
4. If I am able to consolidate all my loans, would my monthly payment be high? I currently am paying about $400/month for my private loans, and my federal loans are currently in a deferment period. I'm scraping by as is so I would like to keep the monthly around where it is now and hope that within a year or two, I'll be making a decent bit more ($60,000-ish) so that I can put more per month towards the balances.
5. In addition to my student loans, I also have a balance of $10,000 on a credit card that I used essentially for school. If I'm able to consolidate is there anyway I could add this in as well?",finance,1428979138

Bitcoin,BitcoinStreetTeam.com WHITE PAPER. New Promotional Bitcoin Company and future sidechain.,"Business Opportunity:  Help improve Bitcoin's visibility in as many outlets as possible, mainly the streets.

Why?:  New user adoption helps increase the market cap of Bitcoin.  Promoting Bitcoin enables those who already possess Bitcoin to realize a price increase.  If you already own some Bitcoin, maybe consider donating to help increase Bitcoin exposure.

What?:

	 A Street Team
	 Billboards
	 Posters
	 Stickers
	 Coupons ie Paper Wallets or Ads with affiliate sign-up QR codes, that could be seen as similar to fiat but legally dissimilar.  Coupons could also give someone redeemable bitcoin at a place like coinbase, circle or bitpay or other broker for signing up.  The coupons can be handed out on the streets from street teamers in busy areas. ""Free Money!""  We are pretty sure it will work.
	 QR Code Begging with Bitcoin message - I bet in the future see people holding up Bitcoin QR codes for money, similar to what the kid did to get on ESPN.
	 Merchandising - Put Bitcoin logos on anything merch related like T-Shirts and Pens.
	 Promote Bitcoin as something that is smart and intelligent to invest in and also USE as money.  It's just better money and we can explain why in clear, readable graphics and simple creative language.
	 Award Show - People who work on the programming, documentation, writing, investing, trading tools, economic analysis, videos, music, podcasts should all receive awards and be honored and encouraged with grants.
	 Super Bowl Commercial - we are going to put Bitcoin in a pot and wait for it to raise in value, when it has risen enough, we will take out a commercial for Bitcoin.
	 Late Night TV Infomercial - self explanatory.  Try to get people to call in and spend say $40 on a beginner investment package.  Have the package with some trusted paperwallets with Bitcoin, some DVDs so people can follow along and be educated about Bitcoin and how to use it and store it.
	 Sponsorship - similar to what Dogecoin did with Josh Wise and the #98 car.  Find high visibility athletes that would accept our sponsorship and but the Bitcoin logo on their gear.
	 Video Games - Bitcoin needs an MMORPG and a MOBA that either use or incorporate Bitcion as an in game currency.  I'm sure people would love to bet on fighting and sports games as well.
	 Gambling - Gambling is a big thing with humans and can cause a lot of problems.  It also has legality issues throughout the world.  Bitcoin will probably be big for gambling.  A street team in Vegas that advertises a gambling site wouldn't be such a bad idea. 
	 Sponsor a really cheap android phone that we can give to independent contractors that is strong sturdy and long lasting.

How?

Make BitcoinStreetTeam.com a sidechain.  

You can now hire people as independent contractors anywhere in the world and pay them with Bitcoin.  You can hire printing companies with Bitcoin.  You can have materials mailed with Bitcoin.  You can automate the entire process of promoting Bitcoin on the streets with Bitcoin!

The artists who create the visuals will recieve the proper dividends, automated with Bitcoin.
The printers and envelope stuffers will all be properly paid with Bitcoin.
The street teamers will be paid in Bitcoin, their promotional materials will be delivered or they can pick it up at a local shop.  They can photograph their work and upload it to the cloud.  The checkers can verify street teamer's  work like how Amazon's Mechanical Turk works.  This can all be run on an android or iphone app for everyone to get paid instantly for promoting Bitcoin.

Risks?

The moneyed elite probably don't want to see advertisements for Bitcoin on their precious Wall Street, but its coming.  We can't really help it, QR code begging is going to be a thing.  It might become dystopian.  Sorry ahead of time if it does... We have been fascinated with Bitcoin for a couple of years now and we want to jump into the pool and offer our creativity to the Bitcoin Realm.  

BitcoinStreetTeam.com wants to treat Bitcoin like a Rock Star and promote it the way it should be promoted. We can't use guns or jail to force people to use Bitcoin, but we can certainly create powerful advertising and a large network of street teamers in a peaceful and decentralized manner.  I think its possible that we can get 1,000,000 to put $20 bucks into Bitcoin before Wall Street gets 20 rich guys to put up $1,000,000.  I've got .1 on it ;-)

BitcoinStreetTeam.com must operate with the utmost integrity because it involves peoples labor and creativity. Since we will eventually become a sidechain, the entire workings of the company will be open source, we also look forward to your input or participation on how to promote Bitcoin effectively to the everyday person.

Promotional materials must only be posted where it is legal to do so.  It is up to the street teamer to know the laws of their jurisdiction.

How to Participate?

We think that BitcoinStreetTeam.com is a viable project.  Right now we are accepting tips to get started.  Whatever tips we make in the next 48 hours we will use at kinko's to make flyers and buy some tape.  We are trying to get $20 bucks total.  

We will then visit the area surrounding the **US MINT AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE and flyer LEGALLY**.

Thank you for helping support this hopefully legendary creative project that if successful, will enrich you, Bitcoin holder.  Let all your whale friends know:

We waited until the end of March to file, in case any more documents came in. We always expect them to be a little late, but this is ridiculous. We already amended our return, and the IRS owes us one more dollar. 


According to this, all the 1099's we received today should have been postmarked by February 17th:

So who can we file a formal complaint with? Maybe we talk to a lawyer about it? This is the third year in a row they've done this. Thankfully each time has been in our favor, but you know the IRS would be screaming bloody murder if it weren't. 

**Edit:** I'm surprised at the mix of replies I got. A lot of you need an attitude adjustment. These were not updated 1099's, but the first time they sent them. Unfortunately, it's getting kind of hard to keep track of the 1099's we are waiting for, because our portfolio is getting more diversified every year. We do go online and view our statements, but some of the associated tax documents are not accessible. Our financial adviser states that he sent all of them at the end of January, so why are we just now receiving them?

I got a 1099-MISC from them in the mail. Since taxes were not withheld, I get no refund. But have to pay money.

Now it looks like I need to pay money in order to pay the money.

I have repeatedly tried to file my taxes over the past few days, and each and every time after I spend an hour putting in the information I am told I need to pony up extra money in order to pay taxes on the miniscule amount of money I earned in 2014.

So far:

1. I tried TurboTax. As soon as I tried to access 1099-MISC, it told me I would need to pay $55 to access that feature.

2. I tried TAXAct, and after I completed all my information I was told there would be a $20 filing fee with New York State (But nothing with Federal)

3. I tried e-file, and after completing all my info was told there would be a total of $71 fee in order to file (25 for NYS, 40.99 for Federal)

4. I tried 1040.com. Once again, Federal was free,  but New York State was a $20 filing fee. I owed $0 to NYS. Can I just not file and not pay the filing fee? I would still file the federal taxes of course.


I thought you could file for free though the IRS website, but all it does is bring me to 3rd party websites, including some I've already tried. I don't really want to try entering my info in each and every single one until I find one that is actually free.

So... what can I do? It's one thing to pay to get a tax refund, but I really don't want to pay a fee that is equal to a large chunk of the actual taxes I need to pay for what tiny income I had last year.

**UPDATE**: I got it! After I went to the NYS website and searched how to file NYS taxes for free, I found MyFreeTaxes.com, which in turn led me to HR Block, which allowed me to not have to pay for filing EITHER my federal or my state taxes.

I pay $300 a month on it, and owe 7900 on it (so I'd pay it off in about two years).  My insurance is $130 on it - it's just an expensive vehicle to insure.  The first quote I got on a trade in for it was 5k, but I'm fairly certain I can get 6-6.5k out of it, as it's in very good condition, and the dealer I took it to was just lowballing the trade (I used to sell cars/deal with trade ins as well).  So I'd need to put like 1100 or so on my loan by that time against the car to resolve the ""under water"" aspect.

I was kicking around the possibility of buying a new car to get cheaper insurance, although it seems silly, trying to see what anyone else thinks.  I was looking at a Jetta, which I can get financed for 1.9% as well.  The insurance on the Jetta would be around $80 a month.

The way I see it, currently I pay $300+130= 430/month for car and insurance.  I can get a Jetta for like $330 a month, with a $80 insurance rate, so $330+80=$410...a savings of $20 a month out of my pocket.

personalfinance,"25, just finished law school, start work soon, general-ish advice/planning help needed","Let me begin by thanking anyone that makes it through this tome. I have some ideas of what I should be doing but want to run them by everyone in case i'm making any huge mistakes. I also have some variables that may affect this calculus, though i'm not sure how to deal with them. I think the easiest way to start is to give a full run-down of my financial situation and then list off the relevant questions, so here goes:

**Financial and General Situation - Facts**

*Loans*

1. I have ~$132,000 in student loans, which are still in the grace period, which I plan to privately refinance (all my friends that have done so received rates between 3.5% and 4.0%) and will have to choose between a 10 or 15-year term

2. My fiancee has ~$17,000 in student loans at an average of 5.6% interest

3. Neither of us have any other debt of any kind

*Salary*

1. My fiancee's salary before taxes is $38k/yr which payroll calculators estimate at $30,710 after-tax take-home with a single deduction and no tax preferential investing or spending; I would like to plan as if her salary will remain fairly stagnant, but this is a safe job and she could easily make that amount for the rest of her working years no matter where we go

2. My starting salary before tax or bonus is $160k/yr. I will receive a yearly raise of roughly 10% each year. Ignoring bonus (I would prefer to plan as if I won't receive one, even though it's virtually certain I will) and with a single deduction and no tax-advantaged investments or saving, my take-home after-tax will be roughly $111,600 per year.

3. In terms of my job stability: it is virtually guaranteed that I can keep this job for 7 years (with raises), but then chances are high (if I stayed for 7 years, probably 70/30) that I would be asked to leave (rather than being offered partner). If I was asked to leave, I would go in-house and people with my firm on their resume typically start around $175,000 when they go in-house to a big company.

*Other*

1. Spending - I can probably keep our household monthly spending before student loan payments or any saving/retirement planning activity around $4,500/month, though a more likely number is $6,100/month

2. Retirement planning incentives - My firm does profit-sharing 401k match and has historically matched 100% of lawyer contributions to their 401k, so assuming they continue to do this, I know I will be maxing this out (so there's $9k/year of my money). My fiancee's company matches 401K contributions up to 5% of her pre-tax salary ($1,900) so I plan on her contributing at least $1,900 to this each year.

**Variables**

1. Staying in the legal field - I really enjoyed school and excelled at test-taking, I also really enjoy private equity finance and startups (a lot of my law firm work will be PE deals), and had Econ and Finance undergrad majors. After 3 years with the firm, I plan to re-evaluate my situation and make one of four choices: 

A) Stick with the legal career, try to make partner, go in-house after year 7 if I don't;

B) Sort of stick with the legal career and go to an early-stage startup that I am excited about and has already raised a Series-A or is in the process of raising one. I would plan on doing this between years 4 and 7 and salary would fall to ~$60k/year but I would get potentially lucrative stock options. If the startup failed, I could almost certainly go in-house at a big company for that $175k/yr starting salary mentioned above;

C) Go back to school around year 4 for an MBA; I would only consider HBS, Stanford, Booth/Chicago, and Wharton/Penn; expected cost of attendance would be ~$175k and then I would definitely shift to private equity (I have the network already to get these jobs) where starting comp (including bonus) would be around $160k with rapid increases but an uncertain path in terms of how long I could stick around; my fiancee could definitely find a job in any market making her current salary, so assume she would keep her job

D) If the market is good and i've decided the firm isn't for me, around year 4, I may start looking to shift directly to a finance role in a private equity firm without going for an MBA; as I mentioned above, I already have the network to be able to do this, the market just needs to be good for these opportunities to open up

2. My brother (whom I would trust with my money and already help him out with legal stuff on) works in real estate and also invests in real estate (I know, he should be more diversified, but he's young too so fairly risk tolerant). He gets access to incredible deals on renovating property and also has good deal-flow through work) He would allow me to co-invest in real estate with him. His real estate deals produce about a 21% IRR (around 12% annual return after cost of capital and inflation) before accounting for principal appreciation (just from the rental income stream). Given that i'm young, i'm also fairly risk tolerant and am interested in potentially investing in this.

3.  The market for homes in my area is insane (sales for above list price within a week of listing), property tax is more than 2% (because we have no state income tax) and using buy/rent calculators, I would need to stay for 4-6 years before it made sense to buy rather than rent. The only attractive side of this, to me, is the ability to get cheap money through the low interest rates on mortgages right now. However, the co-invest with my brother gets fairly similar rates after the first-year (borrow at ~6.5%, produce a year of rental income that's more than enough to protect lender, then refi at ~4%)

**Other**

I know I need to save a rainy-day fund first. I plan to exclusively save for this until I have at least 4 high-expense months of money saved away. My job is pretty secure for 7 years, barring some sort of monumental billion dollar screw-up or bitching an important partner out (both of which would be way out of character for me). As I mentioned above, I know the next step is to max out the company-match 401k contributions. I assume the next step after that is to pay off the fiancee's student loans because the rate on them is fairly high and they're not as easy to refinance because they're undergraduate loans.

**Questions**

1. Should I private refinance my $132,000 in student loans? Should I do a 10 or 15-year term? Should I pay them back more quickly than the term? I will lose a lot of the government protection and programs that would benefit me if I went to a non-profit or government service, but I don't think either of those are for me. The weighted average rate if I left them as federal loans is ~7%. The private refinance has no fees attached and no pre-payment penalty.

2. Should I prioritize: a) paying off my (likely refinanced to below 4%) student loans; b) maxing out the rest of each of our 401Ks and making any (likely none, it seems) deductible contributions to our IRAs; c) co-investing with my brother on real estate or simply investing in cheap index funds

3) Is there anything else I could/should do that I haven't considered? My biggest concern is the uncertainty with whether I plan to go back to school or shift to a less safe field like start-ups or private equity.

personalfinance,Advice/Opinions on Consolidation Loan Programs?,"ok this is my first post on reddit and I read the rules, wiki/faq, and 6 pages worth of threads and didn't see anything that already addressed my question, so here goes:

My credit score is 737 and I get a lot of mail from various companies offering me ""pre-approved"" loans anywhere from 5k up to 30k. 

My debt situation is this: 
$9,500 in credit cards (1,500 @ 9%; 5,700 @ 13%; 2,300 @ 0% as long as its paid off by end of year); 
$28,400 in student loans (~5,500 in federal loans @ 6%; 7,800 @ 8%; 7,000 % 4%; 8,100 @ 2.5%). 

So in total I currently owe about $37,900 at various interest rates for various reasons. Unfortunately all of the different student loans came from different places (i.e. some private, some government, and from various creditors) and I already consolidated the few federal student loans where that consolidation was an option. 

Now for my actual question: Does anyone know about these loan offers I am getting in the mail and whether they are legit or worth it? For instance I am concerned if applying for those would result in a hard check on my credit (and thus a red flag or ""strike"" against me). Also, given that I have so many different existing lines of credit (3 other credit cards that are paid off but still active), is it wise for me to be taking out yet more loans? The offers only say that I can choose the duration of the repayment period (2-6 years) and that the rate would be somewhere between 7.99-15.99%.

I am currently managing to pay off this debt slowly but surely, and I would love the convenience of just one monthly payment instead of 7, but I'm just not sure if these consolidation loans are the way to go. so i humbly appeal to the collective wisdom of this, my favorite sub-reddit!",finance,1429021675
personalfinance,Intra-family mortgage,"throwaway b/c personal info

Hello lovely redditors.  I'm posting this here because PF is awesome at financial wisdom and I may get a different point of view than on r/RealEstate, but I plan on posting there eventually. 

I'm 26, lawyer, no debt and just started working for a non-profit law firm making $44k/year, with great benefits.  At current rate, by the end of the year I'll have my emergency fund of about $3,500, and will have contributed to my 6% employer matched 401k, and possibly put something into an IRA.  I currently rent an apartment at 760/mo but that is guaranteed to go up significantly at the end of my lease (December).  The remainder of my expenses are pretty low, and after food the biggest is probably my dog.  

Here's the meat - my folks have a good amount of money in paper assets (mutual funds, stocks, etc.) right now and would be willing to give me a home loan so I can buy an investment property.  Here are the main points I'm thinking of:
* Max loan of $200k (very likely less), looking to buy at the end of this year
* structure the mortgage so the rate will be recognized by the IRS and I can take a mortgage interest deduction (recent Fed APR was 30yr @ 2.54%)
* I live in an area of the United States that is hot for retiring baby boomers and is growing fast (+5% projected population growth for the next couple years) so whatever type of house I buy will have them in mind
* The areas I'm looking at purchasing have some great fixer-upper houses that won't necessarily need huge renovation, but could use a little work and are in areas that the city is revitalizing 
* A mortgage payment should be a bit less than my current rent so that money can help pay for house costs
* The money that would otherwise be going to a company would be going back into my family
* My parents are retiring in a few months and the interest income for them would likely not change their tax rate (although I plan on getting a CPA to confirm)
* I can do my own legal work and save some money at closing, but I will recommend my parents get another opinion before executing the documents

The overall idea is to live in the house a couple years to get the tax incentives and fix it up and resell.  After fixing it up, I may even rent out a room.  The other good thing is that I'm very unlikely to be foreclosed on if the economy tanks and my parents will be able to diversify a bit out of paper assets.  

I have a great relationship with my parents and we have a good relationship with money, so I don't anticipate any family strife caused by the deal.  This is something I'm very aware of and will proactively avoid.  Happy to give more details if needed.

**Car Insurance:** $82

**Fuel:** $120

**Phones:** $58 (1 cell phone at $45/month, home phone at $13)

**Debt #1:** $100 (debt lawsuit settlement, must be paid no matter what)

**Debt #2:** $100 (another debt lawsuit, must be paid no matter what)

**Groceries and Household:** $300

#Total: $1613 (assuming highest rent and higher electricity)

Current savings account balance is $388 so savings is a priority. We also want to pay off some debts that are not accounted for in the current budget.

**Those debts are as follows:**

* $600 - Old Navy credit card (in collections, original amount owed $300)
* $600 - Lane Bryant credit card (in collections, original amount owed $300)
* $118 - AT&amp;T past due (in collections)
* $167 - owed to my husband's former college (NOT student loan)

In addition, the balances on the lawsuits settlements total around $3000. One has an interest rate of 8% and the other has no interest.

So what I'm looking for are any suggestions on how to improve our budget and make sure that we are trucking along with building a bigger emergency fund and then paying off all of our debt. Our current apartment lease ends in August and we are definitely moving somewhere cheaper. We're looking to shave about $200-250 off the total costs by moving to an apartment with lower rent, lower utilities (smaller), and closer to my husband's job so we can reduce our gas costs as well.

Sorry for the length of this but I have one other question. I am currently trying to decide whether I should go back to school. I graduated high school in 2006, went to 2 different colleges in 2 years and dropped out when some life stress got in the way. I had a scholarship at one school that may still be viable to use now and would make my education completely FREE. If that is still an option, would you personally recommend that I pursue that? I would be going to school for Computer Science if that matters. If that scholarship is not available, I should have another one at the other school but my education wouldn't be completely free, it would probably be around $1000-1500 per year out of pocket AND it's a community college instead of a 4 year school. The other option is to forget about school and work towards getting the best job possible. Any advice?",finance,1429023310
personalfinance,What's the best credit card for me to get?,"Hi PF.  I'm 23 and about to graduate college.  I currently have 2 department store cards.  One I got in February but the other I've had since June 2011.  I've done so well on that that they upgraded it to a MasterCard so I can use it anywhere.  However, it still has the insanely high interest rate so I don't like to use it for anything other than purchases at that store.  I'm in a position where I do want to make some bigger purchases, and I want a credit card with student perks (I'm going to be continuing my education post undergrad), rewards, and a low interest rate.

Does anyone have any ideas?  I would say I have decent credit (always payed my bill on time since 2011, but I do have student loans).  I'd like to get this card soon as there is a big purchase I'd like to make very soon.

I'm open to all advice and suggestions!",finance,1429024630

personalfinance,No End in Sight,"Alright as of right now we are pretty good financially but looking into the future it just seems that there is no end in sight. I will give a run down of what we have and wondering if I am allocating my finances correctly for the best possible outcome in the next 5 years.



So a little background on us I am 27 years old and work for the local government. I make roughly $51,000 a year and get paid bi-weekly and take home 1260. My girlfriend and I have a two year old daughter. My girlfriend just recently graduated college and is hoping to get into the probation field however until then is working a job making $300 dollars take home. So roughly bi-weekly for the both of us we make together $1,860. Now I am fairly well off for the most part I have 3 grand in credit card debt on her credit card that I bought an engagement ring off of (I am in charge of the finances so I used her card since it is still on the introductory rate and she gets extra points). The 3 grand has a 0% interest rate for the next year. I paid off my student loans which were $25,000 three years after graduating. We own both our cars however our cars are getting very old. I drive a 1998 pickup truck and she drives a 07 g6. Both cars have over 100,000 miles on them. The thing that stresses me out is she just graduated and has $35,000 in student loan debt. We have the mortgage which is $68,000. The mortgage is very manageable and dosn't worry me a bit it is the small loans that will be popping up in the future. For example we will both need newer cars in the future an SUV and a pickup truck both probably 20 grand. Than I want to go back to get my masters degree which is going to be around 25 grand with books and tuition. Than we want to have another kid and will probably have to put an addition on the house since ours is only a two bedroom or start looking for another house. 



The thing that saves us a lot of money is I am very handy when it comes to fixing things either plumbing, electrical or automotive. My truck has had a few problems with different ins and outs like a thermostat and cooling lines. Instead of paying a quoted 600 dollars from a mechanic I bought the parts which were 40 dollars and saved myself a ton of money. So I am probably rambling but I will give a run down of expenses and gross pay. Also I am fairly set for retirement I have the public retirement system I pay into 3% each paycheck and than I have 7% being taken out of my paycheck pre tax being invested through the deferred comp program so retirement for myself is not an issue. She has 5 grand in savings bonds which are still earning interest and I would prefer waiting to cash them in however if it makes sense to put them towards a student loan then we will do it. I have in my savings account $26,000 and would like to build it up to half the mortgage before I start investing elsewhere. I have 1600 dollars in the safe in the closet for a rainy day fund in case the furnace, roof or water heater goes so I think I am fairly set in the emergency fund, savings and retirement department. I just need help managing the debt and future debt

personalfinance,Question - Looking for outside advice on a student loan refinance,"Hey all! I am looking for some advice about a student loan refinance I got approved for. 

Background: I currently have a student loan with $37k left on it at a 3.25% interest rate (currently at 3% because of the interest rate deduction for automated payments), but it's variable. It seems that the fed will be increasing the bank prime rate this year and next so I'm looking for some advice.

I have been attacking my student loans and writing a blog to hold me accountable. I have been averaging payments of about $800 on this loan each month (minimum is $219), and will continue to increase that when possible. I have successfully paid off over $15k in about a year. I plan to have everything paid off in about 2.5 - 3 years. 

Here are the options I was given when approved:
10 years fixed @ 5.29%
5 years fixed @ 5.24%
10 years variable @ 2.87%
5 years variable @ 2.82%

My initial thought was that 5.24% is too high to lock in and I should just stick with what I've got. 
2.82% sounds great but it could increase, just like what I have now. Plus, while I do plan to continue paying as aggressively as I have been, I know that life happens so I don't want to force myself to make $800 payments each month, so the 5 year option sounds a little scary. 

I have a credit score of 822 and make over $50k. Do you think I can find a better fixed rate? 

I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks!

personalfinance,Best plan of attack? Debt.,"I was finally able to kill one of my loans [Sallie Mae/Navient]  and I want to use the money I was paying them to pay off my remaining loans. 

I still have a $36,000 loan with Granite and a $10,000 loan with AES. [see link below]

The question I have is which one I should tack the extra payment first? 

I plan to pay the minimum on one and pay approx $333 to 350 monthly on the other - that is all I can afford.
 
It seems the interest rates for two of my granite loans are higher and it would make sense to go that route first but if I pay of the AES loan in 2 yrs I can then refocus all the money toward the granite loan, plus the feeling of accomplishment helps versus 9-10 years of payments. Maybe I'm just deluding myself. Any helpful input welcome.

personalfinance,What student loans to pay off first?,"I am a 23 year old student who graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice is 2013. I have since decided to go back to school for prerequisites for medical school. Because of this, I have several loans. My union at work, however, will pay for up to 6 credits worth of schooling--I'm currently taking 8. I just got a check for roughly $1700 for the fall semester. 

My current loans are:

* Federal Loan: ~$33,000

* Sallie Mae Loan (from a Winter break class 3 years ago): $761.20

* Sallie Mae Loan(From a Winter break class 2 years ago): $970.76

* Sallie Mae Loan (Fall '14): $2670.36

* Sallie Mae Loan (Spring '15): $2673.78

Which loans should I put that money towards?
I am currently deferred on federal loans, so that money would just be eaten up in interest. I think it would be foolish to not pay off the remaining $761 balance. Interest rates on all the others are relatively the same. The sallie mae loans I have been paying $50/month on the older ones, and $15/month on the newer ones.

I am a household employee (nanny) and received a W-2 from my employer. I filed the appropriate 1040EZ form. My line 1 (wages) was filled out, and my line 2 (fed tax withheld) was blank. My line 3 (SS wages) had a slightly smaller number and line 4 (SS withheld) was blank. Lines 5 and 6 were in the same vein. 

All my state income tax information was blank.

I now owe about $900 in state and federal taxes.

This cannot be legal, am I right?

personalfinance,What is the best course to pay off debt with inheritance?,"A little information about me: 25 years old, male, single, $62,000 salary

I'm inheriting a Traditional IRA (~$40,000) and a retirement savings account (~$4,000) plus a few more accounts that were pretty minimal.  I currently have ~$38,000 in student loans at an average interest rate of about 6%, ~$17,000 in an auto loan at 3.9%, and about $4,500 in credit card debt though about $2,000 of that is interest free as long as I pay it off by a certain date which I easily will.

How would you suggest using the inheritance money?  I'm thinking I pull about $30,000 from the IRA and apply it to student loans, just enough so I don't spill over into the next tax bracket.  I know the rules regarding inheriting traditional IRAs so please spare me the lecture on that, thanks.

personalfinance,17 year old wants to know why student loans are so bad,"I'm getting ready to go to college at a great university, and my parents and I are taking out loans to do so. 

The estimated yearly fees for the school are about 60k. I received 15k per year from the university in grants. So, I'll need to take out federal loans for the rest (45k) for four years. My parents are planning on taking out about 35k each year, and I'll be taking out 10k. 

My mom says this isn't even a big deal because there's a grace period after I graduate before I have to start paying them back. And, when I have to start paying them back, the government only requests a small percentage of the income I'll be making. To top it all off, the debt is forgiven after 25 years.

So, can you guys explain to me why student loans are so frowned upon? They seem pretty fair and manageable to me. I've been lurking around here but still want people to comment on my situation specifically. I'm going for a degree in marketing if that makes a difference. Thank you!

Edit: Thanks for your responses. I'm trying to read and consider them all, but I'm in school right now so it's kind of hard. P.S. Just because I don't like being called ""he"" or ""him,"" I'd like to point out that I'm a girl.",finance,1429035594

I'm about to graduate from a decently well off school with a BSBA in marketing and MIS. I have a job lined up to start in two weeks after classes are over making 55K/year. 
I have several loans with Sallie Mae/Navient and one with Discover. All of these loans add up to a collective 120K+. 

I seriously have no idea how I am going to deal with this. My parents were both pretty uneducated and my school gave me zero resources about how to financially prepare for college. I came from a small town and just figured this much debt was normal. Now I'm looking at my expected living cost and I have no idea how I am going to survive this. I feel like I'm basically drowning and there's zero way out. I wish I hadn't even gone to school or I that I could go back in time and smack my dumb 18-year old self in the face. When my parents told me I could go to this school, they said they would help me with the payments but now that I'm about to graduate it doesn't look like they are helping at all. 

I just talked to Sallie Mae/Navient and they said that they don't consolidate loans anymore so I'm not even sure how to try to get a lower interest rate than what I'm dealing with since most are between 6-10%. 

My living expenses include rent for a 1-br with my SO. My own portion of the rent is roughly $700/month. No car payments but my car is basically about to crap out. I already cook 90% of my own meals and spend roughly $50/week on groceries for myself. Sometimes more/less. I also spend $100/month on a gym membership which I guess would be smart to cut, but it's honestly one of the only ways that I can relax. 

I want to start saving for a condo with my SO and eventually get a dog. I'm not too worried about having kids anytime soon (like maybe in 10 years).

So, payday loan. Can anyone point me in the direction of a legitimate service that won't bury me with fine print fees? My credit is ""fair"" (700 last time I checked). I'd need probably 3 weeks to repay at the absolute maximum just in case this check has been lost and needs to be reissued.

My second W-2 is coming from the international branch of the company, and aside from names, addresses, and identification numbers, it only has Box 12a filled in.  It uses code P, and matches up with the costs of a round trip international business trip I took at the end of 2013, presumably my company paid off the charge on my corporate card in January 2014.

From what I can tell, Code P should is for ""excludable moving expense reimbursements paid directly to employee"", but I don't know what ""excludable"" means.  

TaxACT won't let me e-file with this W-2 included.  Should I delete it (which reduces what I owe to both the federal and state governments significantly) or print out my return and mail it in with a check?

My question is whether or not you guys think I would be able to get a decent rate if
I refinanced my auto loan.

The situation is this:
the payoff is $16,290

My current payments are $299/month at 6.79% interest

It's a 2013 Chevy Sonic with about 20,000-21,000 miles on it.
My credit is decent (around 720)

I only got the car in august of 2014.

I only make about $1600/month though so the payments are killing me.

I was hoping to refinance this so that I could maybe have lower payments
or ideally a lower interest rate too. Using credit-karma, I tried to apply
to one of the ""suggestions"" that they post up on your account based on your
profile. There was one with Blue Harbor that would give me something like 3.99% interest
and drop the payments to something like $220 a month, which I got really excited about but I was denied. :(

I tried with WellsFargo and spoke to a guy today who told me that they would
be able to offer me something like $280 a month at a slightly higher interest, which I declined.

I'm starting to think that just based on my financial profile I wouldn't be able
to qualify for anything much better than what I have. I was looking for some insight as to whether
this is true or not;  if not, how to go about getting a better deal. Do I try at a credit union?

The Loans:  
$30k of loans with Navient have been cosigned by the parents of said person.  $70k are not cosigned and are from Fedloan.

If the recent graduate(2 years after loans originated) committed suicide, how would that affect the cosigned loan? Would Navient call the principal of the loan immediately?

personalfinance,Independent contractor status screwing me on my taxes?,"Last year I held two jobs- a near minimum-wage retail job from February to August and an office job September through the end of the year. The latter is a tech start-up and my employer ostensibly chose to treat me as an independent contractor, even though I've worked on-site for 30 hrs/wk since the beginning. Neither job is exceptionally well-paying and altogether I'm looking at ~12k of income over the year with about an even contribution from each job.

In the course of doing my taxes I initially classified my second job as ""other income"" and after all the standard deductions/exemptions I ended up with just over 1k taxable income. That amounted to just a bit over $100 in income tax- substantially less than what was withheld from me, so I would have qualified for a significant refund as far as I can tell.

My parents' accountant (who isn't doing my taxes), however, said something to my parents to suggest that I had to do a Schedule C and SE for self-employment. When I did the math on that it came out to ~$750 in self-employment taxes in addition to near the same amount in income tax. In other words, my independent contractor status in the second job seems to be causing me to have to pay like 6-7x as much taxes as I would have had to if all my income had been wages. 

Why does self-employment tax ignore my exemptions and deductions? Is this correct- is independent contractor status is this unfavorable in terms of taxes? If so, why is that the case, and what is the incentive for my employer to claim me as such?

personalfinance,[Advice] Should I sell my house?,"About three years ago, we bought our home for about $110,000 on a 30 year FHA. Today, comparable homes in our neighborhood are selling as quickly as they come on the market for $160,000 or more. We like our house and the location, but we'd be fine with a change if it made sense financially. So, I'm wondering if we should sell and take advantage of the equity. 

On one hand, I think we should keep it, because it's unlikely that we will ever be able to find a similar steal on a home in our area, as nearly all property values have risen quickly in the last few years. Also, our current home should be fairly easy to pay-off in the coming years, and we could always rent it out later in life. 

On the other hand, I can't help but think about how nice it would be to have $40,000 accruing interest for retirement and other savings.

If we did cash out, we could buy another home (probably in the $150,000 range), financing all/most of it. Obviously, that would give us a larger monthly payment than what we currently have. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that a 10% investment return should outweigh a 4% mortgage interest rate. Granted, the accural/burndow trajectories of those scenarios are headed in opposite directions, and I'm bad at math.

personalfinance,Savings Account Question,"Hi, 

I have read posts on this subreddit for several months and also read the FAQs.  I had a question about opening a savings account.

My purporse of opening a savings account will be to direct depost my paychecks there and transfer a portion of that money into my checking account once or twice a month per my budget. 

I am looking at three options:

1) Ally.  Everyone here knows about it and how great Ally is.  Good app, good interest rate (0.99% APY), etc.

2) Local Credit Union #1:

Dividend Rate: 0.65% for $100 - $100,000.  0.55% for $100,001+
APY: 0.6516% for $100 - $100,000.  0.5511% for $100,001+

3) Local Credit Union #2:
Divided Period is Quarterly.  Interest Rate % / APY %: 3% / 3.0339%.

To my unexperienced self, Option #2 is worse than #1 and #3. 

Lets say I have $10,000 in my savings account and using the compound interest calculator on moneychimp.com, I get $10,099.49 in my Ally account and $10,306.46 in CU #2.


Difference between Ally and Local Credit Union #2 is not that big over a year so does it really make a difference which route I take? 

Where would you recommend I open savings account?

finance,Castleton Emerges as Leading Bidder for Morgan Stanley Oil Business,"Morgan Stanley is nearing a deal to sell its oil-trading and storage business, potentially bringing to a close the bank’s lengthy effort to jettison the unit.

Trading firm Castleton Commodities International LLC has emerged as the leading bidder and is offering more than $1 billion for the business, according to people familiar with the situation. Castleton’s backers include hedge-fund heavyweights Glenn Dubin and Paul Tudor Jones.

Morgan Stanley and Castleton are still in discussions, and any deal—if one is struck—is still weeks away. The New York bank has attempted twice before to unload the business, first in 2012, when it couldn’t agree on terms with Qatar’s sovereign-wealth fund, and then in 2014, when an agreement with Russian oil company Rosneft OAO unraveled amid tensions over Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine.

Wall Street banks are shedding their physical-commodity operations amid a slump in raw-materials prices and pressure from regulators and politicians. The Federal Reserve has expressed concerns that the dangers associated with producing and transporting commodities pose a systemic risk to the financial system.

Officials say incidents such as the BP PLC Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico could saddle banks active in the sector with destabilizing liabilities.

Taking the place of big banks are privately held commodity-trading firms that operate across borders and face less regulatory scrutiny and lighter disclosure requirements. A sale to Castleton would reinforce this trend.

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman has told the bank’s board that selling the oil business remains a priority for 2015, people familiar with the matter said.

The deal is an important part of his strategy to shrink the portion of the firm’s balance sheet tied to debt, currency and commodities trading to less than $180 billion by year-end.

The issue has been a key focus during quarterly earnings conference calls with analysts. Morgan Stanley reports first-quarter results Monday.

The bank has remained active in physical commodities trading during the sale process. This year, the bank has leased almost two dozen tankers to haul more than a million barrels of refined-fuel products around the world, with the U.S. Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast frequent destinations, according to records available from data provider Reuters.

Morgan Stanley also has been supplying gasoline-blending components to Northeastern U.S. facilities operated by Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Motiva Enterprises LLC, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company.

Castleton, based in Stamford, Conn., evolved from a spinoff of Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group’s energy-trading business several years ago.

Its owners include Mr. Dubin, a co-founder of $30 billion asset manager Highbridge Capital Management, which was later sold to J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., and Mr. Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corp. Castleton’s chief executive is William C. Reed II, onetime head of power trading at Enron Corp.

Castleton’s bid topped that of the other contenders for Morgan Stanley’s unit, including Australian bank Macquarie Group Ltd. and private-equity giant KKR Inc., according to people familiar with the talks.

Castleton and KKR had previously submitted a joint bid for J.P. Morgan’s physical-commodity assets when they were on the block in 2013. That business was ultimately sold to Swiss trading house Mercuria Energy Trading Inc. Castleton and KKR bid separately this time.

J.P. Morgan sold its physical-commodities business last year, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. divested a chain of metals warehouses in December. The Fed is preparing tighter restrictions on banks that trade commodities.

The value of physical assets would constitute much of the sale price. Those assets include barrels of oil and fuel, leases for pipeline capacity and storage terminals, supply and marketing agreements with oil companies and a 49% stake in a company that operates pools of tanker ships, Heidmar Holdings LLC. Those values could fluctuate in line with market prices.

The bank had $1.6 billion in tradable assets such as crude oil at the end of 2014, according to its most recent holding report filed with the Fed.

The other part of the price would be a premium, or the value assigned to the trading franchise Morgan Stanley has established in the oil market. The bank has been seeking premiums in the range of $300 million to $400 million, but the offers have come in the $200 million-to-$300 million range, according to people familiar with the talks.",finance,1429111877

Quick example, Married, no kids, no itemizing (standard deduction) making 50,000 contributing 20% ($10,000) into a traditional 401(k) pays an effective federal tax rate of about 5% on the $40,000 that was taxed ($2050 according to HR Block Software). If that same person opts for the Roth 401(k) they pay tax on the full $50,000 (about 7% federal tax owed $3500). In the fist option the guys invests the full $10K vs option 2 $8500 (10,000-1500 lost from taxes). Compounding interest on just those amounts over 30 @ 8% yields $100,000 for the Traditional account and 85,000 for the Roth. Even if the tax rates holds at 7%, it seems like it would be better to do the Trad over the Roth. Am I missing something?

However, he works part-time at another job. This W-2 puts ~$12000 gross income and ~$900 federal income tax withheld. Now we are watching the number on the left and it now says he owes $1100.

I guess my question is, why did this second job bump the amount of taxes he owe by close to $2000? We want to understand before we pay it.

personalfinance,Does anyone know of an online loan repayment calculator (like unbury.me) that can be used for loans with NO minimum payment (deferment)?,"Or have any tips to make my own in excel?  

SO and I are getting married in August and combined finances recently to make paying for wedding expenses easier. Now that we're combined and we're done saving for the wedding, we'd like to start tackling our loans (which are manageable, but still approximately what we make in a year together; the loans are approximately evenly split between the two of us). We have loans as follows: 

* $44,977 @ 6.8% student loans split between 5 loans and 3 different providers, deferred, $0 monthly payment
* $9637 @ 2.8%, deferred with only one provider, $0 monthly payment
* $3705.8 @ 1.99% (car, $251 monthly, will be paid off next July)
* $675 @ 0% until Feb 2016, from a large vet bill earlier this year, currently paying $70 a month, will be paid off by February; we're currently forming an annual bills fund to prevent large expenses like this and car insurance/registration costs from throwing us off
* No CC debt that isn't paid off in full each month or mortgages. 
* E-fund is at $5100 with a goal of $6000 -  3 months of expenses - we will reach that with our monthly contributions before we graduate; until we graduate, our pay is secure. We don't anticipate having problems securing jobs with an approximately 40% increase in pay when we graduate. We have saved everything we need for the wedding - an additional $3700 of expenses + a buffer for a total of $4500 - so none of that will get put on credit.
 
Loans will be coming out of deferment next spring sometime when we finish our graduate work, but we're done saving for our wedding and are ready to start tackling these now (the reasoning for waiting was that if wedding expenses went on credit cards, they would be at higher CC interest rates of 15-20%, so we prioritized those expenses over loans since they are in deferment anyway). 

We have an extra $1000-1500 a month that can be used to throw at the loans (particularly the 6.8% ones) plus any extra cash from side jobs.  

I'm looking for an online loan repayment calculator that will spit out a payment plan like unbury.me or the mint loan repayment calculator that can be used for loans with no minimum payment (right now it says ""this loan will take over 50 years to pay back, please increase your monthly payments"" before I even get around to putting in the money I can throw at them a month). Our goal is to get these paid off within 5 years (with an interim goal of having positive net worth by 2017, which is currently at ~$-32,000), which I think is doable but I'd like to be able to actually SEE what that payment plan would look like based on different amounts being paid into them each month.

My credit card is at a 15% interest rate, and the minimum payment is about the same amount as it would cost me per month if I were to take out the loan and pay it back bi-weekly over the course of 5 years. I would obviously be saving a tremendous amount in interest. The only reason I am hesitant is whether or not it will greatly effect my compounding interest in my 401k. This CC debt is really stressing me out and I know if I paid it off with that loan I'd save a lot of money in interest, and could even increase the payments, or pay a lump sum on the loan with no penalty. Can anyone give me some advice on the best route? Pay the credit card with monthly payments, or take a loan out of my 401k and pay it back at a MUCH lower interest rate?",finance,1429116760

investing,PBR shares rise on Arrests,"Shares of Brazil's state-controlled energy company Petrobras are up 3.3% this morning, while the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF ( EWZ) is up nearly a point.  Fueling the rise in Petrobras shares: Brazil's federal police arrested João Vaccari Neto, the treasurer of Brazil's Workers' Party. He is accused of receiving ""irregular donations"" for the party, as part of an alleged bribery scheme involving inflated prices for contracts between Petrobras and construction firms. A related news conference is planned later today, Dow Jones Newswires report.  President Dilma Rousseff, who has denied knowledge of the scandal during her time leading the Petrobras board, is with the Worker's Party. Brazilians have taken to the streets protesting against corruption. Vaccari recently testified before a congressional committee that donations were legal and approved by the country's electoral court. He said similar donations were made to many other political parties. The investigation continues, and also involves dozens of politicians.  Petroleo Brasileiro ( PBR) said late Monday that it plans to release audited 2014 results April 22; Bank of America/Merrill Lynch upgraded Petroleo Brasileiro from Neutral to Buy on Tuesday.  In comments on its model Brazil portfolio, which includes Petrobras, Citi Research today reiterated its $7.90 price target per U.S.-traded share. 

Citi added the stock to the portfolio in mid-November of 2014, at $9.70. The stock is up 16% year to date, but has tumbled 36% lower over the past 12 months.

personalfinance,[Taxes] Am I filing correctly?,"So i am 23, live at home now but was a full time student that graduated in May of 2014.

Most of my income last year was made in positions that sent me 1099-Misc Income forms. When totaled I made roughly $8,400 in ""Nonemployee Compensation"".

I filed my federal taxes incorrectly the first time about two weeks ago. I did not understand that the nonemployee compensation on a 1099 was different from wages, tips and compensation frm a W-2. After figuring this out, I am scrambling to try and get this ammended today. On the first return I filed, i basically lumped my wages together ($8,400), took the standard deduction ($6,200) and paid the IRS the income tax owed on the remaining $2200. 

I'm trying to file another return right now using tax slayer and am figuring out that I owe much, much more than I had previously thought. My parents claimed me as a dependent in 2014 so I'm guessing this pretty much screws me out of any personal deductions. In total from the e-file it looks like I will owe around $1400 dollars due to unpaid taxes on social security and medicare in what is known as a ""self empoyed tax."" I dont own my own business and thought that my employers would characterize me as an employee, but I guess not? This tax rate is completely unexpected!!!

Am I understanding all of this correctly? Am i filing correctly? Does it make sense that even if I only made around $8,400 I'd still have to pay around $1,400 in taxes? This is going to ruin me financially for the next few months.",finance,1429120191

Total balance due:  $48,316.71
Total minimum monthly payments(""TMMP""): $498.47

Now for my question.  I've read a bit on using the avalanche theory of debt repayment which, as I understand it, would be to put any extra money above the TMMP towards highest interest rate - here Loan A.  However, given that Loan C is almost double the size of Loan A, I wonder if I would be better of strictly following the avalanche approach, putting excess payments towards Loan C instead, or perhaps splitting excess payments between the two.

personalfinance,19-year-old art student trying to file for taxes; am I a dependent?,"The answer is probably yes, I know, but here's the deal I guess. Last year, I mailed in a handwritten 1040EZ because my dad told me it was the best course of action for a teenager working a couple of jobs. This year, because I decided I didn't want to walk to the library and use the printer, I used turbotax. It took me through a bunch of steps to enter in the tuition I've covered with my loans, and it told me that I would qualify for the American Opportunity Credit, except that my tax form was just rejected because I'm being claimed as a dependent.

I pretty much completely support myself, though, other than temporary room and board when I'm home for the summer -- my parents haven't been able to afford to give me anything other than thirty bucks a few weeks ago when I needed to get some more supplies. My uncle and grandpa have been cosigning my loans, because my parents had to declare bankruptcy a couple years ago and are automatically rejected for so much as sneezing near a bank. Does that change anything? If not, should my parents be claiming it somehow and getting the extra money instead of me? 

It's not like they don't need the money, they do and it would be a huge help to them. It would just be a seriously huge help to me, too, because I can't work while I'm at school due to the lack of a reliable form of transportation. And I guess I'll be pretty miffed if I find out they're getting this tax credit instead of me and they didn't think to ask about it first, seeing as they know that I'm out of money and struggling along. A slightly dumbed-down explanation and some advice would be hugely appreciated, I've been trying to look up answers for hours and legal speak is complete greek to me.

personalfinance,Wife's employer changed her allowances on W4 without consent during maternity leave...,"While my wife was on maternity leave from the start of November '14 through mid January of this year her employer somehow changed the allowances on her W4. 

I found this looking at a bunch of pay stubs she brought home from work yesterday. She thought the increase in her check was due to the promotion she received in February.  She only ever checked her PTO balance and pay on her stub.

She originally was at 2 allowances on federal but now its 7 for federal, 5 for state and 3 for local (NYC). So basically she's been paying next to no taxes for 3 months. I went over her leave forms and work paperwork that she needed to do and she never submitted a new W4 while on maternity leave.

How could the employer do this? What's to do next to avoid owing significant money when doing taxes next year? This really pisses me off and would be raising hell with my HR dept. if it was me but she is far too nice. I would love to pursue how this was changed for her and hopefully find out how or who did this.

personalfinance,Missing W-2 Question,"I frequently read on this sub, and just want to say thank you to all the awesome people on here!  I have learned a ton about PF reading discussions on here.  Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.  

So here is my question:
Last year, I had one employer for the first half of the year (part time, in school), and made ~$2500.  Because my wages were so low, I had very little withholding on this income.  I got a new job in May, and made ~$13000 (still PT in school, but higher wage/more hours).  I had appropriate withholding for this job.  

So I never received a W2 from job 1.  I needed the refund, so I used my last paycheck to estimate amounts figuring that the employer would eventually get around to sending the W2.  I really didn't want to report this guy, because he owns a small business that has been struggling and is a friend.  He gave my a job when I needed one and nobody else would hire me, and I always was very fair and honest and a great boss while I was employed there.  

So in filling out my taxes, just based on my income at job 2, i was due a refund of $800 federal and $50 state.  Adding the $2500 estimated income from job 1, I was due $600 federal and owed $20 to the state.  This was fine, so I used the estimated amounts and filed, it was accepted, I received my refund and paid the state, etc.  

However, it is not April 15th and I still have not received my W-2.  Furthermore, when logging into my social security account, my income for 2014 does NOT reflect the missing $2500 W-2.  So it appears that the employer didn't submit it, and didn't pay SS/taxes/etc.  

My question is, what do I do from here?  Do i just accept it and leave it alone?  Can I file an amended return without the missing W-2?  Will this trigger an audit?  Should I report the guy (I really don't want to, but he's been dodging my calls for the past month). 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance,1429122677

personalfinance,Help me decide on a job.,"So I have two job offers and I am torn.

Job 1: Base pay 60k, bonus 10k, normal workload, in my home state, awesome location (Florida), good benefits (4.5% pension, 4.75% 401k, health), okay industry, boring job.

Job 2: Base pay 70k, bonus 5k, overtime pay, higher work load, out of state, okay location (Michigan), bad benefits (only health), awesome industry, interesting job.

I basically have to decide between a job I would love and a location I would love. Job 2 is a contract position but I have been reassured not to worry since they will most likely take me on between a year or 2, this is just something they do at this company. Obviously that is not as ideal as the direct hire of Job 1 though, hence the benefits are lacking. The overtime is for all employees at the company with Job 2 and with the higher workload I would expect to earn between an extra 0-24k a year pre tax. I have always considered both industries as potential job prospects but now that I have them both within reach it is hard to decide. I'm only 22 so I can be a little riskier with my career right now, but I don't want to waste an opportunity. It seems like the numbers push for Job 2 even without benefits right now. I am trying to base it off of which I will regret more; home in the middle of winter or interesting work in the middle of a boring day.

Thank you for the help.



**UPDATE**

Okay so I have the official numbers from Job 2. The hourly pay is 33 which totals $68904 for next year. The benefits include health insurance through Cigna, 401k no match, 3k tuition reimbursement after 1 year, 14 paid holidays, 2 weeks vacation, Life/Dental/Disability Insurance, and 3 days bereavement. I will be attempting to negotiate higher pay, ask about overtime rate, and asking about a relocation bonus.

Job 1 is still $60000, $10000 bonus, 4.5% pension, 4.75% match at 7% from me, Cigna health, Dental/Vision/Life/Disability Insurance, 2 weeks bereavement, $5250 tuition reimbursement, FSA. I have already attempted negotiations and this is final.

So it is still coming down to location vs job to me. If you do the numbers there isn't much of a difference between the two honestly. Job 1 is still better long term, but Job 2 is pretty good for contract and will only improve once I get hired directly, which I plan on happening because of my passion and skills in the field. I don't want to sound like I don't like Job 1's field at all but it is definitely less interesting but I could deal with it. I will say the same about Michigan's weather, it is not ideal but I could deal with it.

personalfinance,College debt. A very personal perspective on 6-figure debt.,"I'm noticing a lot of recent front page discussions on college debt in /r/personalfinance and wanted to share a bit of a different perspective on my own education/debt as well as that of my close college friends over the last 12 years that I've known them. Let me start off by saying that 6-figure debt for a 22yo is not insignificant but it completely depends on what you plan to do with your college education. Instead of rambling incoherent, I'll share the educational paths of my college friends (who were my groomsmen last month) and me. To give you some context, we are all 30-31yo, we met at our Ivy league school. 

* Cameron - grow up in the south, SAT 1580/1600, GPA 3.8. wealthy parents but very all-American so did not pay for his education at all. He got a comp sci major but decided against entering the field as he felt it was monotonous and tedious. He applied to LSAT at the end of college. Combined with average GPA ~3.8/4, he was accepted to Columbia Law. He was about to sign when he got recruited to Bain consulting in Boston. Starting salary 87000, working 50-70 hours/week though he got to travel throughout Europe and the US. He transferred to a well known private equity company after 2 years at Bain, starting salary 120000, and stayed on for 2 years. He got burnt out at 28, but saved enough to take a year off in Asia. His current job is a position in a venture capital company where he works in the virtual reality market, basically product testing Oculus. Current salary 140000. Cameron is incredibly frugal and paid off his debt at age 30. He drives a beat up Subaru and lives on the outskirts of SF.

* Derek - Grew up in LA, perfect SAT scores, GPA 3.2.  His parents paid for 2 years of his education and he had debt for the last 2 years of college. He got a physics degree but was lured into intellectual property law. Attended Harvard Law after scoring impossibly high on LSAT. Moved to major law firm in SF, lived with Cameron for a while actually. He had around 260000 debt coming out of law school but his current salary is around 120000 and he also lives very frugally. I'm not sure how much of the debt he has paid off but he told me he contributes ~1500/monthly. He is returning clerkship for a federal judge in DC next year, which dramatically lowers his salary but he wants to become a state/federal judge.

* Jim - Grew up in the Southwest, SAT 1580/1600, GPA 3.9. Asian guy graduated with American Studies degree. Parents did not help with tuition. Graduated with 250000 debt. Hired at Morningstar in Chicago for 2 years. Salary 65000. Moved to Hong Kong for a girl, got hired at major investment banking company for next 3 years. Salary 150000 + ??? bonus working 80-100 hr/weeks. He actually worked/drank hard enough to go to a hospital. His boss told him unless his dying to get back to work that day. Got burned out, quick and moved back to the US. Started his own business in Denver. Debt completely paid off. Married and 1 child now. I'm sure he's starving now because his business is getting off the ground but his wife is still working in finance in Shanghai.

* Andy - grew up in Westchester NY. SAT 1480/1600, GPA 3.4. College paid by parents but was a slacker in college. Graduated with biology degree. Met his wife in college, married at 24. Went for his environmental studies major in Michigan. Wife followed him to Ann Arbor where she did medical school/residency.  She is the heiress of a jewelry chain company. He now travels to hotspots studying biodiversity. Earns 60000-80000/year. 

* Me - Grew up in the Southwest. SAT 1550/1600, GPA 3.7. parents left 100000 of debt from college for me. I got a biology degree. Went to medical school without parental help. Total debt around 290000, both private and public. 4 years of residency in Anesthesia at my program. Moved here for a girl, just married. Just signed contract entering private practice next year, starting salary 280000/year at consolidated at 6.8% interest. Currently deferring most of my loans. With income based repayment, my monthly payments are now around 300 in residency and probably will be 1800/mo in practice. Manageable. 

I'm going to stop writing at this point and make my point. I'm not writing this to brag. I want people to study and succeed. People may think that my friends are outliers and these stories don't apply to you. You have realize that we were normal kids from average families. We slacked, we partied, we relaxed. I know during my sophomore year at college, I logged 768 hours (32 days) of World of Warcraft before quitting. We did the normal dodgy things that all college boys do at 18-22. Yes, we had good high school grades and SAT scores but our college education provided us the opportunity to overcome our mistakes when we made them. **More importantly, having a group of like-minded friends made each other better, more focused, more driven, more curious.** Another reason why we were able to get ahead is due to the fact that **society gives you a big leeway when you have a strong academic pedigree.** This academic pedigree translates into corporate pedigree. If you are willing to take on college debt, then please **enter an industry that pays.** Industries that pay usually recruit from top colleges. I think Bain doesn't recruit from more than 20 colleges for its junior analyst position. **The people you meet at a great institutions outweigh the cost of attendance.** Anyone who has look at a MBA program realizes that the price of tuition is to network with your classmates and professors. The lectures are merely secondary. People are correct in saying that your education is what you make of it. At a great institution, you can establish the foundations of leading the field. Do you want to work at Mckinsley/Bain/Deliotte consulting? Do you want to work at JP Morgan/Sachs for investing? Do you want to work at Google/facebook/airbnb for comp sci? Then it does pay to go into debt for college. There's plenty of high paying jobs out there. Go for it. **Paying for college is playing for the late game.** My net worth is negative right now. Compared to someone who became a master electrician (which pays $80000/year in the NE, one person in my group ended up marrying one), I'm incredibly behind. But I don't think I will be in 2 decades.",finance,1429123745

news,"OFTEN, LITTLE CONCERN FOR JUSTICE IN LOUISIANA!","Thursday, April 16th, 2015
Baton Rouge, Louisiana

OFTEN, LITTLE CONCERN FOR JUSTICE IN LOUISIANA!

 Remember the scene in the movie, The Fugitive, where Harrison Ford is about to jump off a cliff into a raging river?  He turns to his pursuer, a federal agent played by Tommy Lee Jones, and says: “I’m innocent!”  Jones shakes his head and says: “I don’t care.”  In recent months, a series of investigative reports from across the Bayou State have concluded that numerous federal and state prosecutors are primarily interested in winning — getting the indictment, the guilty plea, the conviction. But when it comes to seeking justice, one could argue that many prosecutors just don’t seem to care.

Legal observers across the nation have colluded that if you want to find the most egregious examples of wayward prosecutors who think nothing of hiding evidence that an accused is innocent, just go down to the deepest of the deep southern states.  Take a  look at a few of the national news stories about prosecutorial misconduct in Louisiana that have appeared nationally, just in the past few weeks.

“The U.S Attorney commenting scandal in New Orleans gave us a poster child for misconduct and appalling behavior.”
The New Orleans Advocate (April 7, 2015)

“New Orleans prosecutors-egregious instances of prosecutorial misconduct. These abuses did not simply stroke the line between lawful prosecutions and heavy handedness; in the words Justice John Paul Stevens, they were “blatant and repeated.”  The New York Times (April 13, 2015).

The Untouchables: America’s Misbehaving Prosecutors, and the System that protects them. Nowhere is this ethos of impunity more apparent then in Louisiana.”   The Huffington Post  (April 10, 2015.)

“Grotesque Department Of Justice Misconduct- In a shocking case of “grotesque” misconduct by federal prosecutors, a federal judge in Louisiana ha ordered a new trial…”  National Review (April 13, 2015)

“Whole System is Fatally Flawed-Justice is subverted so many times for the will-for the winning.  Everyone wants to win, so the ends justify the means.”  Former Prosecutor A.M. “Marty” Stroud.  Shreveport Times  (April 4th, 2015)

In Louisiana Prosecutor Offices, a toxic culture of death and invincibility. – The ongoing problem of prosecutor misconduct, using Louisiana as the poster child to explain why even egregious misconduct not only isn’t punished but also is often incentivized” The Washington Post-April 8, 2015.

Now these articles listed are just about Louisiana. Take a moment to Google “prosecutorial Misconduct,” and check out the reams of news reports on this alarming subject from across the nation.

Shakespeare proposed killing all the lawyers. But numerous lawyer prosecutors have made it a habit of killing any semblance of fair play.  Too often, there is a “win at all costs” mentality where the end justifies whatever means a prosecutor decides to use to obtain a conviction.  Efforts are often not made to seek justice, which is what the criminal justice system is supposed to be all about.  Justice is swept aside when a prosecutorial “no holds barred” effort is pursued to get a conviction at any cost.

One of the more recent misconduct soap operas involves the New Orleans U.S. Attorney’s office where, at the time, the longest serving federal prosecutor in the country, Jim Letten, resigned amid a scandal involving a whole host of his staff.  A federal judge issued a scathing 50-page order alleging possible criminal misconduct by former federal prosecutor Sal Perricone and former first Assistant U.S. Attorney Jan Mann.  The judge singled out Perricone for testifying  “falsely” in his courtroom, and called for the New Orleans U.S Attorney’s office to be investigated by the Justice Department. Perricone and Mann both resigned under a cloud of suspicion along with Mann’s husband, Jim Mann.

Do these prosecutors who break the law act in an evil way?  Or do they just not care?  This exemplifies, in most instances, the prototype of those who bend the law and hide exculpatory evidence to get a conviction.  They may not be evil, but they are indifferent.  The end justifies the means.  They just don’t care about the meaning of our Constitution.  If government crimes are not checked for the few, then we all are at risk.  Prosecutors who lie and cover up should be disbarred and prosecuted themselves.  Otherwise, there is no integrity in the system.

personalfinance,Help me with my life!!,"OK, so I have been lurking on here for some time and am truly inspired to get my life together especially after seeing my credit score drop 21-30 points in a month!! I just need some serious suggestions as to what my fiance and I should do in order to stop using credit cards, pay debt off and get a good emergency savings going.

personalfinance,What happens if my 1040-X has errors after the three-year deadline?,"I got married in 2011, but the Federal government didn't recognize my marriage at the time. That changed in 2013, pursuant to the Supreme Court's decision of _Windsor v. United States_.

I delayed in amending my 2011 and 2012 taxes until about a month ago. I understand that the deadline for the 1040-X is three years from the date the original taxes were filed. For me, that date was April 15, 2012 (I usually wait until the last minute). Since I submitted the 1040-X a month ago (mid-March 2015), I should be within this timeframe.

My question is: What if I messed up the 1040-X?

Will the IRS ask me to submit a new amendment? Will that be subject to the original deadline? Since that deadline is today, is there anything I can do to help myself (perhaps file some kind of extension, just in case)?",finance,1429130578
personalfinance,What happens if I over pay my quarterly estimated tax?,"This is the first time I'm paying estimated quarterly tax and I feel utterly stupid waiting until the last minute to do this. What happens if I overpay it? Just doing some rough, NON IRS math, I think I'll owe about $2,000 for the year for my estimated quarterly tax?? I have no idea. 

I'll earn about $12,700 as an independent contractor, and another $15,000 at my part time job. I tried to fill out the forms, to figure out exactly how much I'll owe, but I just can't get through it because everything is so utterly confusing. (I've already filed my 2014 fed and state tax using H&amp;B Block online, and I can't even use my 2014 return as a guideline to how much I'll pay because I just started as a independent contractor in November.) 

So, if I just pay $500 for this quarter, which I think might be more than I'm supposed to pay, does it pay it forward until I figure it out? I think I'm going to hire someone to help with this because this is way too stressful.",finance,1429131166

personalfinance,PSA: Take control of your finances before they take control of you.,"Just as the title states. There are plenty of posts going around of people owing big at the end of the year for taxes, having money siphoned off by parents, not checking credit reports annually, having an emergency and no emergency fund, etc.

The second your money leaves your employer's/parent's/dividend's/tenant's hand, you should know what happens to every dollar of it. How much is going to Federal taxes, to state, FICA, Medicare, Local taxes, 401k, insurance, Roth, until it gets to your hand. Learn how to read your paystub. Know that the difference in money isn't just going to ""Uncle Sam"". 

Once you have it, every dollar has a mission (budget). Either to make sure your lights stay on, your car gets insured, or that your family has food to eat. Savings goals are also important and you should be paying yourself first, set goals, meet them. Once all of your money has a mission, you should know when it is getting there (due date), how it is getting there (ACH, check, cash), and how much is there (account balances). 

Don't trust your parents/SO/roommate? Don't place your money in joint accounts or in other places they can access it. Foresee these issues before they arise. 

Regardless of the condition of your car, know how you are going to buy the next one. A trade in for a down payment and loose cash isn't the answer, have a savings goal, have a price mark, have a plan.

Check your credit report annually. 

Check your 1040 annually, doing your taxes isn't too complicated. Understand how they work could save you a lot of money. 

Successful /r/pf skills are about being proactive (emergency fund, long term savings, debt management, tax advantaged accounts) not reactive (Help! I haven't paid any taxes and owe big. Help! My credit score is shot because of an account that has been in collections for 5 years. Help! I co-signed a loan for a friend and now they won't pay.) I know each post has a unique story behind it but use this sub to **improve** your finances, not just **recover**. 

It breaks my heart with every ""I just got kicked out of my house and I have no money"" post. This sub has the information to redirect your financial path in just a few months, actual change may take longer but you have to start somewhere. Changing the way you think about money, how you save, how you spend, can not only provide you **security** in your life, it can also provide you **confidence**. 

Wait no more, do not become the next ""**Help!**"" post. Become the next Success Kid meme.

Something was always sort of off about her (why repeatedly attempt to sell me an insurance policy when I work for a fortune 50 company???). She had been in the group for around 5 months, and was became more and more obsessed with ""the business"" as time went on.

Yes, I know it sounds crazy, but I discovered the branch manager did not own the house he claimed he paid for at a recruiting event / house party. This is a tactic they use to draw members. They make themselves seem more well off than they really are by renting expensive cars and homes and passing them off as having been earned through ""the business"".

There are many reports claiming that these fraudsters are actually broke and/or carry bankruptcy filings.

Seriously, note that Google gives you omitted results when inquiring about some of these things.

It was pulled down for unknown reasons, but.... Using the Way Back Machine (an internet archive service), you can see this website as it was when it was still standing in 2006. There are accounts from past WMA and WFG employees that you will likely find shocking if you have spent any time near this group or those involved. I would not believe it if I hadn't experienced it myself. In my opinion, these people are worse than Amway due to their arguably ingenious way of covering their tracks and the fact that they screw people (usually Asian immigrants) over tens of thousands of dollars at a time (under the guise of ""helping"") typically using their FIUL (indexed universal life) time bomb policies. They tell you that you are investing and getting life insurance when the reality is you pay out the whole first year to the agent who sold you the policy as commission, and the high maintenance fees plus cost of insurance eat up any sort of ""savings"" the policy was supposed to retain. Don't believe me? Let them draw you up a policy, have them print it out, then take it to any reputable firm to get the full details on what you are being sold. The cycle never stops because they ask you for 25 names when you are recruited, and will call these people regardless of whether you decide to stick with the business using your name and relationship to leverage a sale or recruitment. The entire system being commission based and recuit focused with attention to exploiting the trust of those around you. They will tell you all sorts of things like being backed by Aegon and Transamerica. Great, Amway is also one of the largest companies in the world too but a quick search can turn up plenty of horror stories involved related to their MLM scheme.

Seriously, mention something skeptical about the business and you will be called ""negative"" and ""arrogant"" (words straight from their training which is textbook ""vindictive psychology""), because some higher up schmuck overextended a line of credit to show them a sparkly Mercedes and fed the recruit a line of bullshit to keep them believing in ""the business"". Those trips they boast about? Those are never paid for by the company, it is either out of your own pocket or an investment by your upline to put you in a conference with a bunch of made up sob stories designed to emotionally entangle you in the business, to make you feel you are helping people when the bottom line is peddling FIULs and HELOCs to screw over people who are usually already in financial trouble to begin with.

So I graduated last year and now make about 40K a year. My question is whether I should try to pay off my loans sooner than later (I am projected to be paid off in 10 years). I have about 40K in loans..

The interest rates on each are as follows..

- $19,000 @ 6.55%
- $5,000 @ 3.6%
- $16,000 @ 5.2%

I have done some research on the matter and a lot of people mention that it really depends on the borrower, which is why I am asking.. A few people have mentioned that although it may give you some piece of mind to pay off the loans sooner, you actually can make more money through compounding interest by using whatever surplus money and contributing to a roth (I should mention I am 24 years old). 

My minimum payments are about $400...

Debts:
195k - Mortgage at $1300/month (paying extra) 4.25% interest
2100 - Car (2010 Toyota Corolla) 2.99% currently paying $300 month (paying a little extra)

$8,000 emergency fund across various savings accounts


I know that financially, it makes more sense for me to take the tax return and pay down the student loans. The car is charging me less than $6/month in interest. However, I feel like I would get a large emotional boost with the car gone. I would then take that $300/month and put it towards the Student Loans (and probably more as I will no longer be supporting the (ex)girlfriend).

So, basically, the question, is the financial boost of putting $2500 towards student loans at 4.3% better than the emotional boost of getting the car free and clear?

I am complete NOOB when it comes to financial stuff. It’s a lot, so here goes:


**Job:**

Resident Physician

Annual Pre-Tax Income: 52,000   live in Southern California 


**Student Debt:**

Combination of Stafford  subsidized, unsubsidized, and Direct Student Plus loans

***Total:*** ~270,000

**Interest rates:** 

5.41% -  50,000

6.41% - 20,000

6.8% - 160,000

7.9% - 40,000

Credit Card Debt:
 None (one credit card, make payments on time every month)

Credit Score: 711

**Retirement:**

401A – 3000 (employer does NOT match)

Roth IRA – 2000


I am a resident, so my current earnings are much lower than what I will be making in the future. That being said, I am not sure what I should do regarding the money I have now.  I have an additional 4 years of residency left.  Average income upon completion is ~ 200K.  Should I work toward lowering my student debt, invest in the stock market, put it toward the roth IRA? Additionally, I’d like to build my credit score up to eventually apply for an additional credit card.

personalfinance,Help! Parents claimed me on food stamps and I now owe the state 10k,"So I have recently found out that my parents got food stamps when I still lived at home a few years ago and during this time I turned 18 and soon after moved in with my then girlfriend and current wife. Fast forward to now and I am 22 and found out that my parents were getting the food stamps fraudulently and had to pay back the overpayment which is in the 10000$ range.  I recently spoke to someone in the office of inspector general (this is for Georgia) and was told that because I had turned 18 while they were receiving benifits that I am considered a liable adult for the debt.  also I just found of my federal taxes have been taken as payment since my parents refuse to pay the debt, and I fear that they will keep taking my taxes until it is paid off even though I had no part in this, I never agreed to anything or signed anything. So this is severally hurting my credit and taking money from me that I desperately need being a college student. Any help with what I should do would be much appreciated.

Edit: thank you for all of the advice and sorry I have not replied to any comments today have been taking finals all morning. I plan on contacting a lawyer to see what my options are to get this out of my name and to also find out what to say when filling the police report because when living at home I knew we were getting some kind of assistance but not to the extent that it was because again even after turning 18 I never gave consent or even financial information for their benifits, so I believe they were claiming that I had no income and was still living at home, which I was not.",finance,1429147394
personalfinance,"Graduating college shortly, what do I do next financially?","I’m graduating college in May and I have no idea what to do next. My parents have made it clear that they want me to move out fairly soon, and I completely agree, I would love to move out. I’ll admit I’m quite naive and I have very little real world knowledge. I expect I’ll have a difficult time finding a job, but I’d like to know what the bare minimum income I need to make in order to actually buy a house and avoid debt. 

A little about me: I have no college debt. I have no car payments (except insurance), my car is brand new, so I don’t expect to have to put much aside for repairs. My parents have savings totaled of 150k which will become mine completely when I’m 24? I’m renting a storage unit at $70 a month until I find a permanent residence.  I always like to have around $500 saved for my pets’ vet bills (the more the better).

My parents and I have spoke and they think it’s a good idea for me to apply for credit cards to build credit so I can apply for a loan for a perspective home when the time comes. I’m having trouble finding a reputable company that will accept people with no credit, preferably without a monthly fee. Our plan is that I’ll eventually put around 20% down on a starter home and take out a loan for the rest, rather than tying up all my money and purchasing a home out right. I’ve tried calculating living expenses along with a mortgage, but I’m not sure how much I’d have to make annually before it’s safe to purchase a house. 

I plan on living my with my boyfriend, asking him to pay for half the mortgage and utilities, but I wasn’t sure if this is fair. I was playing around online and I was thinking with a budget of 225k for a house, putting 70k down, with an interest rate of 3.9%, the mortgage would be $1,023 per month. If this is the case, if we both make 35k each, we can live pretty well. If we split the mortgage and utilities I figured our expenses would be approximately $512 each for home/insurance, $458  each on utilities (water, gas, electric, cable/internet) and groceries,  and we’d have $954 to go into savings, additional spending, gas each month. However, if anything happened, it would be possible but it would be tight financially to pay the mortgage/ living expenses. Do my numbers seem right? I tried rounding on the higher side to be safe. This arrangement seems fair to be because I’m putting the capital down on the house, and the monthly payments are lower than apartment rental rates in our area, but I’d really like some opinions. I’m really not sure if I’m just dreaming and this is all completely off, but that’s why I’m asking here! 

As for renting, I rented throughout college, and hated it. My landlords overcharged and allowed little flexibility. I hate the idea of renting, because it seems like a huge waste to me. I'd rather live at my parents' house than renting.",finance,1429149384
personalfinance,Inherited an IRA - No 2014 distribution was taken out - but I'm getting THAT distribution in 2015 - should I claim it as 2014 income? (on my 2014 tax return?),"hi Personal Finance, 
I have asked all the professional types I know, even the current IRA holder at Merrill Lynch, and the soon-to-be inherited-IRA holder (which is Vanguard), but no one seems to know.

warning: its slightly complex, and in the interest of not leaving any relevant details out, slightly redundant at points.  So if you're the type who gets a headache even *thinking* about taxes or financial matters, you probably just want to skip this post.  For those who know more than I do about IRAs/Inherited IRAs and how such things intertwine with taxes, read on!

Of course, before asking today, I did write the IRS (twice in the last month) but no reply (of any kind from them) ...and I emailed them via the irs.gov website too, nothing.

So, I thought I'd roll the dice, and see if the financially-savvy people of personalfinance could help me ?

(as they've helped me in so many other ways in the past).


This is the situation, and question. (actually its 3 questions - numbered 1,2, and 3 below)

But first, here's some quick basic (relevant) info that you most likely have to be made aware of to be able to even think of answering.

I have already filed my personal 2014 federal and state taxes (and gotten my refund from both).  So, all seems fine there.

I used Turbo Tax (if that matters?).  And my income was low (very low, under 10k for the whole year).  I got $620 back from the federal govt and $39 back from my home state of California.

But, there's one perplexing, newly-arisen issue (that I learned of **AFTER** I filed my 2014 tax returns) that I was hoping someone could let me know a bit more about.

It started with my father passing away (in May 2014).  My mother inherited everything, so I had no inheritance income or money received from that, and I wasn't expecting any.

However, I was just recently notified in 2015 (about a month ago, and AFTER I had e-filed my 2014 tax returns) by Merrill Lynch that I am a beneficiary of my deceased father's regular IRA 
 (which I am now in the process of converting to an ""Inherited-IRA"" in my name, at Vanguard - thanks for letting me know about Vanguard, personalfinance!).

;)

I was also notified, at this time (2015), by Merrill Lynch that my father had not gotten around to taking out his IRA's 2014 annual distribution, and that I (as the beneficiary) had to take it out, and that Merrill Lynch would be sending a check for the amount of his 2014 minimum distribution.

I will be getting this check (the 2014 minimum distribution) in the next couple weeks or so, I am told.

The check I'll be getting is for approx. $5060.00

so... with all that background &amp; info setting the stage, Here is the actual questions (finally) that I had for you all:

1.) This is in regard to the 2014 minimum distribution check that Merrill Lynch says they has to send me ASAP (and that has to be sent before I can transfer it to Vanguard too).
Notes: 
- I didn't know that I was a beneficiary on my dad's IRA account, or that it even existed before I sent in my 2014 tax return.
- I did not receive this 2014 minimum distribution until after I had filed my 2014 tax returns (I haven't even receive it yet at all, although I am told its coming soon).
As such, If I am getting a **2014 minimum distribution** check in 2015 from an IRA that I am a beneficiary on, is that ""income"" or something that I should amend my 2014 tax return to reflect?

or, 

2.) since I actually learned of it, and actually received it in 2015, is that payment for the 2014 minimum distribution something that I would just report on my 2015 tax return when I file that?

and lastly... 

3.) Since there will probably be a penalty levied for not having taken the 2014 minimum distribution out in 2014 (my dad died in May 2014, its not like he could have been expected to have taken it out before 2014 ended, and I didn't know of the account till after 2014), Is there some way that I can appeal this penalty, or have it not be applied to me, as it was from an IRA that I didn't even know about being a beneficiary on, hence there was no way I could be expected to have taken the 2014 distribution as I didn't even know I had the account until 2015 (and found out weeks after I had filed my 2014 taxes too)?",finance,1429151567

And while rates will undoubtedly rise again at some point, guaranteed instruments will never outpace inflation. This creates a dilemma for many investors who seek a decent return on their money, but don’t want to risk losing their principal. However, there are several investment options paying higher rates of interest than CDs and treasury securities with a very reasonable amount of risk. Those who are willing to explore some of these options can significantly increase their investment income without having to lie awake at night worrying whether their money will still be there in the morning. Low risk investments can be a perfect investment solution if you want to make use of your savings without endangering your capital. Low can come in many forms, from a savings account to saving certificates and bonds. As there is little or no investment risk to your savings (other than potentially the risk of inflation eroding the value of your capital’s purchasing power or the institution collapsing), the interest rates you will receive will be lower than what you would expect if there was an element of risk involved. For those who are willing to take some risk with their savings, it may be worth considering something which has a higher in order to maximise your investment returns.

personalfinance,401k Loan question...,"Okay, so I have a credit card account that got closed almost 8 months ago for missing a single payment (Amazon Store card).  My credit is shot due to student loans, so i'm trying to pay everything off that i've owed in the past and carry only a small balance on my two cards which each have limits of $500 and $750 respectively.

My amazon balance is currently at $890 (interest and fees) with an account limit of $800.  even though the account is ""closed"" I am being charged about 25% APR on that balance.

I can take a loan from my 401k, spread out over 2 years for $1200 and an interest rate of only 4.25% interest.  I'd pay a total of $53.76 in interest over the lifetime of the loan from my 401k which would go towards my savings anyway (though i'd have to pay taxes on that $54 as ""income"" (double taxation?) apparently.)


Should I take out the $1200 loan from my 401k and pay off the $980 balance on the amazon card / put the rest of the money to pay down my $500 card (which is at around 400) to below 50% utilization?  it will cost me $52.24/mo which they will automatically deduct from my first paycheck each month.  Currently i'm paying close to $130/mo towards the amazon card and based on basic math, it looks like it'll take about 4 years to pay it off at this interest rate (most of the $130 goes towards interest and fees).

Is this wise taking from my 401k to pay off this debt to help me reduce my monthly payment, get it marked 'paid' on my credit report, and also help me start building up a ""buffer"" in my checking using the money i'm not putting towards that bill?  Or would it be hurting me by taking from my 401k where my current balance of $4,600 is earning approx 18% return per year?

I'm tempted to pull the trigger on this as it seems like i'd be saving a TON of money, I just don't know if there's anything I should be aware of.

Also, i can borrow up to 1600 apparently... should I borrow the whole 1600 an put that left-over money ($710) towards one of the higher interest private student loans (which i'm paying 12% on?)

Background (though it shouldn't matter)- Divorce, kid in hospital with serious illness for 6 months, business partner breakup/payout, etc. Took 3 years to go from negligible debt to brink of financial ruin. I am current on all my bills, however, and have a 730 credit rating.

Current Situation-
270K Mortgage (30 yr 4.375) This is shared with ex-wife, though I own the house. I'm self-employed and she was always the W2 person, so together we were able to qualify for a mortgage no issue.

15K Home Equity line (maxed)

53K Credit Card debt

My question:

I was able to refi my house by myself (and get ex off the mortgage) after 2 good years of income (110K/125K). I am financing 325K (30yr 4.25) (payoff both mortgages, pull out $40K in cash).

So... my question, oh finance gurus- I will be putting the $40K towards all my credit cards. I have 5 of them with various balances and various interest rates. After I pay them down is there any reason not to close them except for a couple? I'm a consultant and have uneven cash flow, so plane tickets, meals, travel, etc for business has to be purchased and reimbursed, so I have to have cards.

For instance, my Amex (loyal card member for 15 years, tons and tons of charges) went into a penalty rate of 27.7% due to my high debt load. Always paid on time. So, if I cancel the card (which would save me the annual fee and streamline my situation) are there any repercussions?

Any downsides here or alternative strategies? Thanks for the help.

personalfinance,Debt consolidation question,"I have a few debts that I am thinking about consolidating.  I have enough income to service these debts, but not enough cash to pay them off all at once.  I am just trying to maximize my situation.  I can possibly refinance my home to consolidate these loans.  

The loans are as follows:

Mortgage - $155,000 - 10/30 ARM (8 yrs left) at 2.5% with $75 PMI per month

Home Equity Loan - $30,000 15 yr loan at 4.5% interest

Car Loan 1 - $12,000  - 4 yrs at 2.25%

Car loan 2 - $4,500 - 2 yrs at 2.5%

I can refinance all these loans into a 15 yr mortgage at 3%.  Or perhaps another 10/30 ARM at 2.5% and pay it off early.   

The advantage of the refinance is:

1)  it would remove the $75 PMI

2)  lower the home equity interest from 4.5% to more like 3%

3)  Rolling the car loans into a refinance, the interest become tax deductible.  

Disadvantages:

1)  Mortgage interest rate goes up from 2.5% to 2.75 or 3.  (however, this interest is tax deductible)

2) length of car loans gets extended

personalfinance,Paying Unsubsidized loans to subsidized loans.,"Hello PF, so I have a question that I'm pretty sure I know the answer to, but I'd like to hear some pros/cons. 

I'm 3 years into my bachelors, I work full time and support myself fully. I have 2 years to go on my degree and currently have about 7,000$ in student loans (combination of subsidized &amp; unsubsidized). I'm making voluntary early payments, albeit minimal (~$20/month when I can afford it). I don't foresee the need to borrow anymore, but due to my expected ""need"", I'm approved to borrow $2750 per semester unsubsidized.

Now to the question...  Would it be advantageous of me to borrow the subsidized amounts to turn around and make large payments on my unsubsidized loans?  It's also worth mentioning that my subsidized loans, while not currently accruing interest, will be compounding at 3%, whereas my unsubsidized loans are currently compounding at 6% every month. 

What I'm essentially trying to do is informally refinance my loans with a lower interest rate and delayed interest. It seems too good to be true, so I'd love to hear what the cons would be for this loan flipping.",finance,1429203122
personalfinance,How to build credit if you are new to the united States,"When I arrived in the U.S, I was introduced to a financial system that I had never experienced before.One of my first financial lessons was on credit scores.I came from a society that required using cash on almost any transaction.Debit and credit cards were seen as tools for the rich,and there were no credit scores in use.Most of us believed that “Cash was King”. I didn’t understand why lenders in the U.S wouldn’t extend credit to someone who had cash.

If you are coming from a country where you were lucky to establish some credit,it’s still difficult for U.S lenders to access your existing credit reports because cross-border data laws often keep credit information from a foreign country from being exported to the United States,” says David Rubinger , spokesman for Equifax, one of the United States’ three credit reporting agencies.

What is a credit score?

In the U.S, a credit score is a numerical expression of how well you are likely to handle credit based on information that’s been sourced by credit reporting agencies.Your credit scores determines whether or not you’ll be approved for a credit card,vehicle loan or apartment.

Where do you start?

The credit score system and how it works can be very confusing to most of us.I will only talk about the basic steps needed to start and establish your credit.Most of the people moving to the U.S don’t take the time to learn about the credit system and how it affects their financial life.I signed up for my first credit card with a low limit of $500 during my first week in college – and in the U.S. I did not take time to learn about credit cards before applying for one.

There were several banks advertising on campus for new bank accounts and credit cards.I had no business signing up for a credit card without any income.(But hey ,I couldn’t refuse “free” money when offered to me).This led to me getting more credit cards, a down spiral wallowing in debt and finally jeopardizing my credit score.

Here are some tips for anyone looking for a way to establish and maintain good credit in the U.S

1.Your credit score is tied to a social security number. Most lenders will require a social security number to check your credit when you apply.If you need more information about how to obtain a social security number,visit http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10096.pdf

2.Get a secured credit card.When you open a bank account,ask your bank if they can offer you a secured credit card.With a secured card, you leave money in a deposit account with the financial institution as collateral for your credit card. (Your credit line is generally equal to the amount you have on deposit, so this means there is less risk for the financial institution if you don’t pay.)

Start with a small amount,usually $ 500 and ask upfront if the payments will be reported to the three major credit reporting agencies (  Experian , Equifax and TransUnion )

3.Talk to companies with which you already deal.If you have a credit card from your home country issued by a company that also issues cards in the US, you might try finding out from them whether they can issue you a US-based credit card.

4.Get a cosigner. If you have a family member or friend who has already established credit in the U.S., you can ask them to cosign on a new loan or account for you. However, do not be offended if they say no, because there are pitfalls. Your cosigner will be liable for this debt if you can’t pay. And if you miss any payments, those late payments will hurt your cosigner’s credit as well as yours. (Late payments can be reported for seven years.) So it’s essential that you pay on time each and every month.

5.Store cards.You can try applying at local stores like Target,Walmart,Kohl’s, Macy’s, J.C Penny etc.Also check with your local gas station for a gas card.These cards are relatively easy to get.Once you have some of these cards (Don’t get too many),pay off the balance completely every month.

Before you get these cards,ask whether or not they report to the credit bureaus.Otherwise there is no point especially if you are trying to establish a credit history.

Once you have established good credit history and have a proper credit card,cancel all the store cards.They typically have high interest rates,most can be used only at the issuing store and they entice you with rewards,discounts and special offers in order to spend more.

Conclusion

You need to go step-by-step: get a Social Security number and a US address; get credit even if it means getting a secured credit card or store card; and pay your bills on time every month. Once you have a credit reference under your belt for at least six months, do it all over again.

Keep the balance at 50 percent or less of your total credit card limit for the card.Having credit makes it easier to get more credit, but having lots of credit isn’t always ideal.It shows lenders that you may be over extended with your debt obligations.

Lastly, once you have a credit-building regime in place, don’t forget to check both your credit report and credit score at least once a year.Ensure that everything reflected on the report is accurate.You can check your credit report for free at www.annualcreditreport.com

I'm posting because I did my taxes yesterday (leaving it late usual), but this year the IRS taxed my scholarship disbursements:

My total tuition and fees during 2014 were a little over $9,000.  My total scholarships (including work-study [$1350], loans, and grants) were a little over $21,000.  

I received the difference (minus the $1350 for work-study, which I earned and paid withholding on during the fall semester) as a total of three university refunds throughout the year.  I used it to pay for my books, rent, food, and car insurance.  I also have two part-time jobs which I earned $5000 at during 2014.

The IRS took the ~12000 from my scholarships and worked their magic and now apparently I owe $700 to the federales and $550 to the state where I live.  This is an extremely hefty amount, and one that I did not see coming.

Any advice?  Thanks!",finance,1429206155

We've been offered a refinance deal with our current mortgage provider.  We've only been in our home for six months so we weren't even thinking of refinancing for years, but I took a look at the offer.

They're offering 3.5% (0.25% less than our current rate).  Same number of months.  $1500 closing costs, factored into the new mortgage.

According to the mortgage company:

Monthly savings: $18

Lifetime savings: $11,510

And if we take the deal but keep paying our current amount (in other words, overpay each month by 18 bucks), we'll pay off the house 17 months sooner.

Alcoa-  They really seem to have gotten their act together.   They have diversified and reformed to a less volatile company that should be less impacted by AL price fluctuations.  I am impressed that they have held the line on low dividends because that tells me that they are building for the long haul.   Plus when they do raise dividends watch out!   Plus how great is it to pick up a big name for $13 dollars a share.

Sea World-  Just got a new CEO with a track record for success.   On top of that all amusement companies should do well this summer with the low gas prices.  If your are concerned about the Orca issues, remember they own 11 parks and only three have Whales

Tetra Tech Inc-  They are an engineering company involved in drinking waste water and recycling water (and environmental issues).   They are winning one federal contract after another lately.  On top of that the drought and future water shortage will make their expertise on this subject invaluable.

2. Send the new guy on a quest to find checkered paint (or rainbow paint), wrench extenders, bootlegs, etc.

3. Find a gigantic icicle and hand it to the new guy. Tell him to bring it over to geology.

4. And my personal favorite; a new guy once complained that his nipples were chafed after working a few hours. Normal solution is just to wear an undershirt. Our supervisor told him he needed to grease his nipples, and that it was normal for guys to do this. He was skeptical... when we got back on surface, our supervisor shouts over to the shift boss ""HEY, ALWAYS GREASE YOUR NIPPLES RIGHT?"". This was really clever because the shift boss thought he was talking about the grease nipples on mobile equipment... his response was a clear ""EVERY SINGLE SHIFT!"".

personalfinance,2 years unemployed and savings are finally gone,"Good Morning All, quick rundown.  Honorable Dishcharge from the military early 2013.  The same month, my divorce was finalized, 6 months after the decision was made to end the marriage.  I've worked for 3 months since.

This month, I ran out of money.  I've been mostly unemployed for the past 2.5 years, working a job for 3 months before I was let go about 2 years ago.  I was recieving UI at the time I was working, and continued to collect after I was let go.  UI expired after 1 year, in early 2014

Since then I've managed my debts with a combination of using my savings, overuse of credit cards as well as receiving non taxable stipends (GI Bill).  Last fall, I took out subsidized federal student loans of 4,500.

This month, my savings are gone and I'm unwilling to use my credit card any further, which is already at about 75% utilization.  I havent used it in 3 months, I'm wanting to pay it down.  The majority of this debt is from my divorce a few years back with the rest coming from living expenses during inconsistent months after UI ended.    Total credit card debt is 10,120.  This is all on one card with a credit union.

Just before filing for divorce I traded in my truck and bought a new car, planning on a family.  I still owed on the truck so the car was underwater.  Remaining balance is 24,100, with a Black Book Value of 17,500.

Rent is 600 a month, utility included.

Other expenses include 110 for car/renters insurance and 75 for cell phone.

&gt;In summary, my monthly obligations total to 1,585, assuming minimum payment on credit card.  *My monthly income in 1,240. Total debts, including student loan, is 38,720.*

I'm sure you've noticed I haven't included groceries, gas, and other costs throughout the month.  So, whats the next step?  I fully intend on continuing going to school in a way that does not limit my availability (which it does right now).  Its guaranteed money, and decent money too.  However, as non-taxable income I can't claim it as income.  As far as any creditors are concerned I make 0 dollars a year and am unable to obtain a loan or refinance.  I've tried to obtain a private student loan but apparently my school does not do that (which was news to me).

Long Story Short, I don't make enough money to pay my bills, and I don't foresee this changing any time soon.  I'm open to any and all options including bankruptcy, but I believe it should be able to handled as a lower level.

My wife just got a government job and I had some questions regarding the retirement program that maybe some of you might have some insight on. I am pretty familiar with traditional retirement vehicles (IRA's, 401k, etc) but this seems to be a pension based position. However, they have two options to chose from. I will paste the text of the handbook below:

Employee/Employer Pay Contribution Plan (EEs/ERs): The employee and employer share equally in the contribution to PERS, currently 13.25% each for regular members and 20.75% for
police/fire members. Employee contributions are subject to withholding for federal income taxes. The employee’s share of the contribution is refundable upon termination. A refund of member
contributions cancels membership in the system and any and all rights to a monthly benefit earned. If you elect the employee/employer-pay plan, you may switch at any time to the employer-paid plan.


Employer Pay Contribution Plan (EPC): Employees may voluntarily choose to participate under the EPC plan. Employees who elect this plan pay their portion of the contribution by way of a salary reduction equal to approximately ½ of the contribution rate on a pre-tax basis. The employer then pays the contribution to PERS, 25.75% for regular members and 40.50% for police/fire members. Contributions made by the employer under EPC are not deposited to an individual member’s account and are not available for refund upon termination of employment. Once you select the EPC, you cannot later choose or go back to the EEs/ERs. Employees on EPC contribute by way of gross salary reduction and are paid at a lower rate than employees on EEs/ERs and defer the payment of federal income taxes. As a result, their take home pay is slightly higher than similar employees on EEs/ERs

This can be found on page 22 of this [PDF](http://nvjobs.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/hrnvgov/Content/Resources/Publications/Employee_Handbook.pdf) 

So, from my understanding the EE/ER has 13.25% take of after-tax pay and the employer matches that contribution. If she were to leave the position then we get to take back all of our contribution but not get the ""matched"" amount.

The alternative is the EPC which means that less is taken out of the check (12.9%) and it is taken pre-tax. However, if she leaves the job we get nothing back. 

It seems to me that if you expect to leave the position after a few years that the EE/ER is the better choice, while if you are going to be a lifer then the EPC is the better choice. Thanks!",finance,1429219739
personalfinance,Credit Union offering mortgage with nothing down and no PMI,"So, I joined a local credit union a few months ago and learned today that they are offering 15, 20, and 30 year mortgages with no required down payment and with no PMI. The interest rates I was quoted was 3.675% for a 30-year and 3.250% for a 15.

I know conventional wisdom says to put at least 20% down, but I've always thought that was to avoid having to pay PMI, which is covered by the bank in this case.

personalfinance,Double Charged for Federal Taxes (Weird Situation),"I've had a strange situation occur. I used Turbotax this year to process my Federal and State. I ended up owing $88 to Federal. Turbo Tax offered to pay my $88 using my bank account, but I opted to pay by credit card. I then used the service known as Value Payment (https://www.valuetaxpayment.com/main/) and processed the $88 under my credit card and received confirmation number. This was done back on February 9th.

Recently (4/15/15) the IRS charged me another $88 under the name USATAXPYMT. I contacted Intuit and the agent, Derek, who works at home and was very rude, pretty much told me to hope and pray I get it back. I contacted Value Payment and they confirmed the payment was done back in February. 

The IRS on the other hand was unreachalbe, no matter what time I called. I now have been charged twice because Intuit somehow provided my bank account information and the IRS withrdrew the money again. (I'm sorry if some of this is redundant). I contacted another service who had access to the IRS database and confirmed the payment on 4/15/15, but could find no record of my Value Payment (which I have the confirmation number for). 

Anyways, in summary I have no idea how to dispute, contact, or resolve this extra $88 charge. Can anyone help? Thanks.",finance,1429226545

personalfinance,"Two years after college, where to go from here?","Hello Reddit,

I graduated college 2 years ago and am about to turn 24.  I live with my father and for the most part he takes care of living expenses.  For the last 2 years I have been working full time and have been saving a majority of my money.  In a few weeks I will be getting a new job and moving from 46k/year to around 60k/year with benefits, 401k matching etc. So for the facts...

*~17-18k left on student loan debt at ~2.9% interest - payments are $510/ month and loan will be paid in 3.5 years (reason for low interest rate is my father took out a home equity loan, payed off federal loans with that money and I am paying on that.  Loan is not in my name though so I do not think I am building any credit.)

*32k in savings

*additional monthly expenses total about $600, rest goes into savings

First and foremost I need a car and that has been one of the reasons for saving for the past 2 years, the other being the job was unstable and I was not sure how long it would last.  Going against most of what this subreddit says I am looking to buy a new car in the ~25k range.  My original plan was to pay for most of it with the cash keep about 10k in the bank for emergencies and take a loan out for the remainder to help build credit.  The other things that come to mind are starting a Roth IRA and paying down the student loan but since the student loan and car loan (2.9-3.0% checked with the bank) are such low interest is there any real hurry in paying them off?

Longer term I would like to have car and student loans payed for and have ~50k in the bank for down payment on house. Hoping to accomplish this in 3 years or so, I do not want to waste money on renting a place and my father seems okay with it as i help around the house.  

Its just a lot of options and I am trying to wrap my head around it, so any advice is appreciated.

Income:

-~$1700 bi-weekly paycheck

-~$450 rent assist from GF
 

Responsibilities:

-$1156 mortgage payment
-$576/month Credit Card Debt Payments w/ ~$7k in balance (transferred all my CC debt to a chase slate card ((0% interest rate for 15 months and 0% transfer fee) and I NEEEED to pay this off before March of next year to not get any interest charges)

Assets:
-1998 BMW M3 (worth maybe $8-10k?)
-1997 4runner (daily driver but pretty much worth nothing)
-$1k in stocks and cash 

Plan:  
So right now I am working on my debts.  I will be done with my car loan around September or November of this year and the credit card by March of next year.  Once that is done I wanted to sell the M3 and use that to put a down payment.  The Viper I am looking at is the second generation and I am making my budget $40k.  I am assuming that I will be able to get a loan from my credit union (same as the BMW 1.99% APR and for the viper maybe 5 year loan?) and I am assuming that I will be able to get some sort of weekend car insurance on it (keep it locked in the garage and drive it maybe 15-25% of the time).  My hope is that car payment and insurance is about $550/month which would allow me to shove $900-1000 a month in my savings/investing account.  I am also assuming that since it is a limited production car around 15 years of age that it is nearing the bottom of the depreciation curve.  

Potential Problems:
-So the 4Runner is my daily driver and I believe it is a ticking time bomb.  It has 325k miles on it.  If it explodes I will need to get another one.  I want to avoid making another car purchase while i am paying off the viper.
-The credit union may require full blown insurance on it and that will be really expensive.

• SF Bay Area (extremely high COL area)

• $135K income

• $115-120K available for a down payment (still $10K in our emergency fund after that)

• No debts other than student loans (total of about $65K - about $800/month).

• Good credit - ~800 for me, 760-770 for her

We've settled on the area we want to purchase and I've spent a lot of time on Redfin and similar sites browsing houses and getting an idea of what's available and how much pain it'll be to buy a house in the Bay Area (hint: a lot!).

What I'm stumbling on though is *where do we go from here in terms of getting pre-qualifed and then pre-approved?*

I come from a technology background, so I'd much rather do as much online as possible rather than walking in to a random bank branch, also I would hope that there would be reasonable online places who can go through my financials and at least get the ball rolling for what dollar range of home I can look for, and once we're really serious (and have an agent) get actually pre-qualified for one.

My questions:

• Any good sites to get pre-qualified online? Do I need to do things like physically visit Chase (my checking account's bank), and a local Credit Union branch?

• Do I pull my own credit scores and provide them, or does each time a lender looks at my stuff, they do a hard pull? Doesn't that cost money and hurt my score if I did it more than just a few times? How long is the pull good for in case this process takes 6 months?

• Do I need an Agent right away, or can I get a feel for what we can afford first? I'd rather not have to deal with incessant phone calls and emails if we decide to hold off for another year.

• Is there any easy way to comparison shop mortgages - online or not? Buying a car has really changed from ten years ago until now in terms of the number of sites that get you the lowest rates possible with little work (like TrueCar), but I'm also willing to work hard to comparison shop since it's likely to be well over a half a million dollars we're talking about.

• Finally, anyone purchased a house in the Bay Area recently? It's a real shit show obviously, but any insights, success stories, things that keep me from wanting to sell everything and move the family out to farmlands and become farmers, because we could at least own the land under our feet?

Bitcoin,The next price bubble,"There are 120 million households in the US. To be in the top 1%, your total wealth has to be about $9 million. So 1.2 million households have wealth greater than $9 million. If 10% of the these households or 120,000 put 5% of their wealth or $450,000 into bitcoin, that would equate to $54 billion. Once the prices starts to take off, the wealthy from other countries start buying, then the masses start to buy - another $108 billion is purchased. Total market cap is $165 billion or price per coin ~ $12,650

A scenario where this could happen (and it is not good): 

By October 2017, total US debt will be about $20 trillion. If the average interest rate to service the debt rises to  3.5%, $700 billion will be needed just to pay the interest on the debt. A recession hits and tax receipts are projected to bring in just $1.5 trillion. Deficit will be over $1 trillion. Congress can't agree on how to tackle the debt and deficit. Investors lose confidence. At the next 10-year treasury auction, no buyers show up causing rates to spike above 8%. Japan with their debt to GDP ratio at  300%, defaults on their debt triggering margin calls and  panic in the fixed income market as well as the stock market. Many, especially those most able to do so - the wealthy, load up on hard assets such as gold, farmland, real estate and even bitcoin (through an ETF or BIT). Then the masses follow.

personalfinance,"Girlfriend's estranged father withdrew from her mutual fund years ago, now the IRS says she owes them $9,000 - what are her options?","Hey there,

Back in the early 2000's my girlfriends father opened a mutual fund for her college fund without telling her, he put it in her name but he is the account custodian. Over the years the amount grew to $37,000, but during that time her mother died and the father went off the deep end and ditched his family and friends to go live with a new family.

In 2011, he withdrew the entire $37,000 for himself, the next tax season my girlfriend received a notice from the IRS that she owes them $7,000 ($9,000 now because they deferred it since she makes too little money) in taxes on the profits from the mutual fund. She sent them a letter saying she didn't receive the money but the return letter never came in the mail, she filed taxes without issue for 2 years.

Now this year, she received a notice that her state and federal are being handed over the IRS due to this bill. She called to get it resolved, but the IRS says she can't do anything about it because it was supposedly released with her social security number. She tried calling the bank which handled the Mutual Fund but they won't release any information about the account because she's not the owner (her father is), and there are no traces of her social security being tied to the account.

We're not sure what her options are now, the IRS doesn't believe her, and the banks won't help her because she's been removed from the account. Any advice?

Edit:

Someone asked me to include this narrative in the OP:

""Well first he stole all of the money that was meant to be used for college tuition, then allowed the IRS to place the tax burden on his own daughter, then didn't tell her about the theft, then only gave a portion of it back when she received a tax letter from the IRS and she threatened to sue him.
She would have paid the taxes, but after her mail to the IRS explaining the theft from her father, she never received their followup, then she had no issue receiving a tax refund for 2 years. She (badly assumed) that it was dealt with, and used it for college. They decided this year they will start taking her tax refund which is the only reason she knew it was still an issue.""

Bitcoin,Alan Greenspan: another unconscious quote on bitcoin.,"In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect
savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe
store of value. If there were, the government would have to make
its holding illegal, as was done in the case of gold. If everyone
decided, for example, to convert all his bank deposits to silver
or copper or any other good, and thereafter declined to accept
checks as payment for goods, bank deposits would lose their
purchasing power and government-created bank credit would
be worthless as a claim on goods. The financial policy of the
welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of
wealth to protect themselves. […] This is the shabby secret of the
welfare statists’ tirades against gold. Deficit spending is simply a
scheme for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of
this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights.
If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the
statists’ antagonism toward the gold standard.

personalfinance,Advanced Re-Fi: pros and cons of cash-out mortgages with low interest rates?,"I'm thinking about re-financing; the rate structure is such that I can reduce the interest by more than 1%, so financially it's going to make sense.

I have a low LTV, (so, room to take cash out and still avoid PMI) and a number of investments.   The cost of money these days on US mortgages is so ridiculously cheap, it's amazing.

Now broadly, I have two options - I could minimize my interest and pay my house off faster.  This to me seems similar to choosing to invest more money in real estate.  The other option would be to take some cash back out of the house and invest the cash I took out.   Given that (conservatively) I can easily earn 4% and upwards by investing, and given that the bank wants in the low 3%'s on their loan, it would appear that the better deal is to borrow more money not less, invest it and keep the difference. 

I'm aware that cash-out followed by investing is fundamentally more risky, but it also has a much higher up-side.   Rates are just so low right now that it seems that the spread between what they're charging me to rent the money and what I can make with that money are relatively large.

So what does /r/personalfinance think?  This seems to me to boil down to a simple risk/reward proposition.  Straight re-fi with a low rate already has a nice return (because of lower interest) but it's also very low risk.  Cash-out re-fi plus investment certainly has more risk, but also much more upside; if my investments work out, I could pay the house off even sooner by using capital gains.",finance,1429282577

About 60k in Govt loans with a very low interest rate.  Around 3% and paying about 300 bucks a month.

I was letting bills run late and then catch up after I saved the money up.  Very ignorant and dumb mistake, I know.

Because of my various screwups, my credit cards have closed themselves or lowered their rates. 

Specific questions.  I know this sounds insane, but I would like to clear up what I can (ie: credit cards) and consider buying a house in the next year or so.  Is that a pipe dream?  What should I work on first to make sure that I am in the best position that I can be in?

The defaulted/closed accounts.  The 22k student loan is being autodrafted by the company that bought the debt.  They are taking about 300 per month which is just a little more that I was paying before.  Being that I defaulted and it hurt my credit, is my continuing to pay it off going to mitigate this damage?

personalfinance,Help me figure out a working budget/savings plan? Thanks guys!,"Hi there /r/personalfinance!

Alrighty. Where to start? 

I currently have zero savings. As far as debt goes, no credit cards. However, I do owe my boyfriend's grandmother $600, and my boyfriend about $1000. I will have my boyfriend's grandmother paid in full by the 25th of this month. My boyfriend is ok with me paying him back slowly once his grandmother's loan is paid.

I have a new job I started in February. I make $29,172 a year, with the potential to be bumped to an even 30k after 6 months, depending on performance. Judging on how I have been received so far, I think it is likely that this will happen. This is my first ""real job."" Before this, I was working a couple of minimum wage jobs to not-quite make ends meet, hence the lack of savings and the debt.

I am paid once a month, on the 25th. I believe this figure never changes, and is a simple division of 12 from my salary. My first check was a prorated amount. My second (and most recent) check came out to $1922.57, which is post taxes. Future checks should be about $110 less, as my health/dental/vision insurance will be kicking in.

My current monthly bills are as follows:
Rent+Washer/Dryer- $475

Water- ~$10-$20

Electric- ~$30-$60 (I live in Orlando, so Air Conditioning is a HUGE variable.)

Internet- $50

Car insurance- $127.59 (This was about $50 higher, I very recently switched providers to get this rate)

Walt Disney World Annual Pass- $36.50 (this is non-negotiable. While I acknowledge that this is an ""unnecessary"" expense, I will not cut this. Disney is why I live in Orlando, and I feel like paying this amount a month for unlimited entertainment ends up saving me quite a bit of money.)

Ipsy/Birchbox monthly beauty boxes- $10 each (I am thinking about cutting these before I get charged for May. The excitement has started to fade, and while they are both a great value, I feel like I am spending $20 a month for a bunch of samples I would never choose for myself.)

Gas- $200 (This is a huge expense for me, but I see no way to cut it. My job is about an hour commute each way, 5 days a week.)

Each of the bills that are a shared expense with my boyfriend (who I live with) have already been chopped in half for the figures above.

Aside from the above listed expenses, I need to obviously buy food for myself, and I would like to have a little fun money.

Ok, now lets talk goals. Obviously, I need to settle my debts. I would like to establish an emergency fund. And I would like to roll my emergency fund into a school fund.

I do not have a college education, nor do I have any interest in a traditional college education. While I am currently in theme park/retail management, my dream is to learn computer animation/visual effects and work in post production in the movie industry. 

The school that I plan to attend is the DAVE School. The school is a one year program, and is very respected in the industry. I have done extensive research over several years, and feel confident that this is the school for me. I would appreciate it if all advice could be strictly financial, and not people trying to point out why this school is a poor choice. Again, I have done extensive research, and feel that this school is the best choice for me personally. 

The main issue with the DAVE School is that, while it IS accredited, they do not currently accept any of the traditional student financial aid. No FAFSA, No Pel Grants, and no traditional student loans. Which is incredibly frustrating. Their main financing company that they worked with used to be Sallie Mae, but I believe that partnership has ended. There CEO has alluded to possibly accepting FAFSA in the future, which would make my life so much easier, but I'm not counting on it. 

The fee for the year is $33,500, which is daunting. My parents have informed me that they will be able to foot $5,000 of this bill for me. The rest will need to be savings and private loans. I will also need to save up enough to live on for the year, or get another loan to cover living costs. Since the school is cramming 2-4 years of education into a single year, it is important that I am able to focus on it. It is expected that you will spend just as much time doing school work at home as you do in school, if not more. I would prefer not to work for that year, or to work bare minimum hours per week to help supplement, but not cover, my living costs. 

I want to aggressively save to reach my goals. Since I got my new job, I have been trying to keep my spending to a bare minimum to pay off my debts. This life style has been difficult for me, and I have slipped up a few times, but I do feel like I could get used to it so I can reach my goals.

So, /r/personalfinance. I was hoping you guys could a) help me figure out a working budget that will take in to account the fact that I am only paid once per month and that I would like to aggressively save and b) give me any advice on procuring loans for school when I eventually attend. Because I honestly have no idea how any of that works.

Let me know if there is any information that I did not think to include! Thank you!

Edit: Just to clarify, I currently have about $450 in the bank. About $100 of that is what I am going to use to keep me fed and gassed up until the 24th. The other $350 will be going towards that $600 debt to my boyfriend's grandmother, with about $250 from my paycheck on the 25th to square that debt away entirely.",finance,1429287325

So tax time comes and after catching up on bills and everything i have about $2500 to spend on a car. I found a 2002 fully loaded Nissan Altima on craigslist and my boyfriend and I met with the lady 2 days later. She seemed nice, she was older and had a nice clean house with pictures of her family and all. She mentioned having cancer and chemo payments. We checked out the car, drove it, and everything was looking good so I bought it the same day for 2000. The check engine light came on 3 days later and I shrugged it off as it was a little older and that might happen. As I thought, the light went off 2 days after that and stayed off for 2 weeks. 3 days after the light came back on, the car died completely so I had AAA tow it to the garage. Basically my mechanic told me it wouldnt run without an entire new motor, there was no compression in a few of the cylinders, something was wrong with the timing, and it needed a catalatyc converter which was at the very least $3000 worth of work. He thinks she knew something was definitely going wrong and had the light shut off just to sell. I had the car for literally a month.

Right after finding this out, trusty Sam the Subaru dies and strands us at a Mobil. I scrapped both cars and scrap is extremely low right now so I got about $400 for both and with another $100 I'll have a $500 down payment on another car. My question is, how can I keep myself from getting screwed again? If they check my credit my interest will be through the roof with a repossession on my credit and my boyfriend has no credit and no insurance record which will put us right back to square one with another Pontiac situation that we can't afford. Plus I really cant afford not to have a car with a 2 and a half year old and he's missing all kinds of job interviews and it just sucks.",finance,1429296919
personalfinance,Debt consolidation?,"First time poster on this, please excuse lengthy post.

I have gotten into debt with my credit cards. The short version is I worked my ass off at a salary job for 2 years while my husband was finishing school and wasn't able to work during that time. Afterward I ended up having to move over 1,000 miles away from a separation.  I had previously been screwed by a car dealership when I purchased a vehicle 2.5 years ago so my payment is over $400 a month and my interest rate is horrendous. I am now also about $5,000-$6,000 in credit card debt and it's absolutely killing me. My credit score is now in the low 500's. I am trying to figure out how to tackle this. My daily expenses and regular bills leave no room for credit card payments. I learned the hard way what a poor mistake it was to have opened them. I don't know how debt consolidation really works or how to qualify. I am starting school in July and relying on loans for that as well. I have just moved again and am not currently working though I have an interview Monday that if I get the job I'll make $15.00 an hour 38 hours a week. 

What should I do? What can I do? Should I try to apply for a personal loan or a debt consolidation loan? Is it possible to take almost $10,000 extra in student loans to pay off all my cards at once?",finance,1429300639

So, I have about $800 on my credit card right now, and I think the interest rate on that is around 20%. I can't pay it off, not really much of it at all. Obviously, I'm concerned about the interest spiraling out of control. I might be able to ask my girlfriend and/or my mom to help me, but I feel bad about that.

My minimum payment is $35, which I can definitely pay. But will I still accrue interest that gets added to my debt? Or, as long as I pay the minimum payment, will they not make me pay interest? Obviously, the latter is preferable as I expect I'll be able to pay off my debt in the future when I'm in a better financial position; if it spirals out of control, I don't think I'll be able to without help.",finance,1429313823
personalfinance,"Father is encouraging me to ignore collections, but I would like to negotiate it, if possible.","I visited the ER in 2012. I had no insurance so my grandmother paid $200 for the pills they prescribed me, most likely, but at the time I assumed that it covered my hospital visit. I never got any bills or heard anything of it after that, but then again I've moved around a lot and haven't always updated my current address in a timely manner, so it's possible the letters were sent to old residences. I was/am young and ignorant, and never checked my credit report. Long story short, I'm pretty sure my debt is valid, and it is now $1,390.92, including interest.



My father is advising me to ignore the debt and the letter in which I must dispute or confirm the validity of the debt. He says that it's doubtful I will be sued over this amount and the statue of limitations will expire next May (I live in California where the SOL is 4 years, I believe).



I don't think his advice is correct, and I would like to negotiate a pay-for-delete, but I'm very confused about how to obtain a settlement. I am currently a student with a few federal loans, $600 in savings, I have no assets, and I haven't been on a payroll in roughly 4 years (my job pays me under the table). Can someone please explain or walk me through the steps of negotiation?

Things I am confused about:

1) I've read that sending a debt validation letter can actually make it harder to negotiate a deal.

2) Will I have to send a second letter afterwards, disputing or confirming the debt?

3) I believe this is the second collection agency, as my credit report shows the account closed by a different 
company. If I can negotiate a pay-for-delete, will the original creditor still appear on my credit report?

4) Am I confirming the debt if I try to negotiate a deal (will the SOL be reset)?

5) What happens if they refuse to settle with me? Do I just ignore the debt and hope they don't sue?",finance,1429313835

personalfinance,Interest rate's affect on home prices,"I was going to rush into purchasing a house after hearing that interest rates are going to go up in a few months.

My current situation is that I have about 10% down + closing on a 300k home. The mortgage broker said I can just pay PMI until I hit 80% LTV. The mortgage payment is comfortable. 

Or I can wait another year to get the 20% down. I am worried that after interest rates increase I would end up paying more for little benefit. 

My question is what should I do in the above situation. Also when interest rates go up, do home prices typically go down? Is there any historic data on this? Would they even each other out?

personalfinance,Private student loan help?,"So I'm 21, in the US and I'm looking to go to University for a computer science degree. Problem is, because I am so young the FAFSA takes both my income and my parents income into consideration when deciding how much aid I get. For the next two years it looks like I can only expect a total of $7000 per year in financial aid, including all subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans offered. But in state tuition is $14000 per year, not to mention living expenses (which I feel confident I can handle with a part time job and accepting a much lower standard of living). 

So I have to make $7000 come from somewhere, namely private student loans. This is completely uncharted territory, aside from subsidized federal loans, I've never taken on major debt before. I have a credit score around 700, but very little credit history to back it up. And having a cosigner **is not an option**, because doing so would disqualify me for in state tuition (my situation is a little complicated, I have to do this completely on my own), and the cost would sore to ridiculous levels. Now, CS is one of the best degrees as far as ROI, so I'm not worried about taking on significant but reasonable debt. What I am worried about is making a bad deal or being taken advantage of in some way that either leaves me paying much more than I should have, or even worse, running out of money halfway through my degree and being saddled with debt and nothing to show for it. 

So, and **TL;DR** if you skipped all that backstory, where do I go to get a private student loan? What rates should I expect? What do I need to look out for? Please, PF, drown me in your wisdom. I want your financial expertise all over my fiscally responsible face and chest.",finance,1429324533

personalfinance,I am a recent college graduate [22m] with my first job! I need advice on how to manage my current financial situation!,"Alright, this is my first post on reddit! Long time lurker and first time posting! This subreddit has been very informative and helpful! Please bear with me if this is a little long. I just want to provide as clear a picture as possible! I'm hoping that the folks here in PF can give me some direction!

So, I'm a single 22 year old electrical engineering graduate (BSEE) in the southeast. I just started my dream job at a private company with ~4000 employees and revenue in the billions. This particular company is a huge disruptor in it's field and part of the reason why I sought out employment there. The company does not plan to go public for long time (around 10 or so) and since it's a fairly ""new"" company (&lt;10 years), the hours are very long (50-80 hours) but everyone here has a huge passion for the work. 

My starting salary is $70k before taxes and a stock award of $105k with a five year vesting period. My benefits are excellent (health insurance, vision, dental, etc...) and are payed 100% by the company. However, the 401k offered does not provide any employer matching contributions.

I spent every summer in college interning at different engineering companies and an 8 month coop stint to get experience and earn enough money to pay my tuition and books for nearly 5 years. I also spent a few semesters as a UTA to pay for school too. My parents let me stay at home on the condition that I attend school and finish my degree. I commuted from home every day to school to save on rent expenses (I live relatively close to my college). 

I was debt free until my last year at school when I had to take out loans to cover my remaining tuition. You can see the results of that below! It came out roughly a little over $9000! 

Debt:
$7,615.05 - Federal Student Loans (2 subsidized loans @ 3.86% and 2 unsubsidized loans @ 4.660%)
$1,589.04 - Credit Card @ 20.99 APR

I'm starting basically from scratch here. I have really nothing in the way of savings or an emergency fund at the moment. I'm currently living at home with my parents 20 miles away from work for now rent-free. I have my own car, a 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix, that I bought with cash 4 years ago so I don't have a car payment. I've never had a problem with it (seriously, the most expensive thing I've had to replace were the tires, the next major repair was replacing break-pads) and it's still running like a champ with no sign of slowing down! 

I'm very fortunate that my parents have agreed to basically cover my living expenses until I can pay off my debt. As such, the only expenses I have currently are car insurance and gas.

Recurring Monthly Costs:
Cellphone - $0 (Paid by Work)
Car Insurance - $42.31
Gas - $145

Question 1)
My take-home amount will be around $4,000 a month after taxes. So I have a few questions for this lovely community! I plan to pay off my credit card balance completely with my first paycheck. But after that I'm not sure how to split my paycheck out. Should I just put 100% into my student loans and pay those off as fast as possible? It will probably take around 2.5 months if I do that. Or should I save a portion for an emergency fund, retirement, etc...? I'm very fortunate that I don't have many expenses right now. 

Question 2)
Once my debt is completely payed off, I'll have 2 options available. I can move out to an apartment and start renting somewhere close to work. Or I can continue to stay at home and save up for a down payment on a house. I will be in this area here for a very long time, so I will be buying a house here eventually even if I start off renting somewhere first. Houses in this area are typically $150k so a down payment would ideally be ~$30k. Which path do you think is smarter financially? 

Question 3)
Also, I have an existing retirement account from previous companies with a small chunk of change. It's a traditional IRA now since I had to transfer out of the 401k. Should I convert this account into a Roth IRA and work on maxing out yearly contributions? I could contribute to my new employer 401k but since there's no matching, I don't really see the point. I won't be contributing more than $5,500 a year for a long while anyway. 

Whether I use a traditional or Roth, I at least plan to max it out yearly. I understand the differences between the traditional and Roth but I'm not sure which is best for me... What is your advice on saving for retirement PF? Should I explore other avenues of retirement saving in addition to an IRA?

That this is happening at a time when the federal government is cutting food stamp and other benefits, and so many states are increasingly eviscerating what little remains of their safety nets, just rubs salt into the wound.

It's not enough that Americans suffer the fact of wealth inequality, but the proponents of that inequality have to kick people when they're down.

My goal here is to specifically improve my credit score as much as I possibly can while in college and before I need my credit to account for things like vehicles/houses. As a preface, I am a college student with grants but no loans, and I do not make a monthly payment on anything (parents pay my car insurance, ty Mom and Dad).

I mean, I'm sure she was giving me her best professional information, but she was a little bit of an airhead IMO and I didn't feel confident opening the card just yet.

She told me I shouldn't open Discover IT, the card I was mainly interested after reading about it on here, because the interest rate was about 25% and most people don't take Discover. Instead, she suggested that I open a card linked directly to my bank, Suntrust, and we discussed an unsecured card. I told her that I wanted to probably have my parents cosign, and she said in that case a secured card would be better. She didn't really explain the difference, or maybe I wasn't understanding. I know nothing about credit cards, to be frank!

Anyways, she told me that my best route would to be to open a secured card, cosigned by my parents, with a $500 credit limit to start. She said that there was an annual fee of $50, and that she suggested that I pay above minimum on my balance each month, but that it was in my best interest to leave a little bit of a balance on there to accrue some interest and show banks that I was able to handle interest and still make payments over the minimum amount each month. This is different from what I had heard in my high school economics class--I'd been taught that you should pay the full balance off each month in order to improve your credit the most! I have been told that it'd be in my best interest to spend below 10% of my limit when using my card each month, though she never mentioned this part??

Any advice is appreciated!

personalfinance,"US citizen in Germany with $60,000 federal student loans, considering renouncing citizenship- good move to pay less in taxes later?","I have been reading through the old student loan threads and haven't come across my situation. I have not lived in the US for 5 years now, and I don't plan on moving back. I live in Germany with my partner and I am planning to become a citizen within the next couple of years. Allegedly I can have dual citizenship, but I was thinking of simply renouncing my American citizenship once I become a German citizen. Why? Because I think it's ridiculous I am paying US taxes on income I earn and pay taxes on in Germany. Furthermore, I owe $60,000 in consolidated federal student loans, currently paying on IBR with 6.5% interest. 

I am wondering 2 things: first, I learned that if I renounce my American citizenship, I no longer have to pay US income tax. Does that allow me to qualify for $0-per-month payments on IBR since I am technically earning $0 taxable income? Second, I was planning on making payments only on the accruing interest of my loans to keep the total loan down at $60,000 by the end of 20-25 years. By the time the repayment period is up, I can then pay the mostly affordable income tax on the forgiven amount. Is this a good strategy?

*Edit: After some comments, I realize I did not make myself clear here. I am not trying to get out of paying my student loans. I am trying to keep from paying double income tax on income I earn solely in Germany. ALSO, I am worried that once I reach the forgiveness period on my loans (20-ish years from now) I will have to pay tax not only on the $60,000 forgiven, but the sum of $60,000 + my German income. But it seems if I qualify for Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, I can avoid this.

personalfinance,I have no retirement plan. What should I be doing right now?,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I've seen this subreddit offer extremely insightful advice to people in similar situations, so I thought I'd put myself out there.  Since I began my career, I've basically been flying on auto-pilot as far as my long-term investment/retirement plan.  Also I have been skeptical of the advice provided by banking institutions/financial advisors, etc., as I feel they are inherently biased.

I'm WCM software consultant at an independent firm, and a contractor to a global software products company.  I am in my late 20s, single, no kids, and bring in about 150k year before taxes.

I have 3% employment matching to my SIMPLE IRA, for a maximum contribution total of $12500/year, which just started this year.  As far as current portfolio holdings I have about 9k in my traditional 401k from a previous employer, and 9k in my Roth IRA (neither of I currently contribute to).  I have around 50k in savings, and only about 7k in debt for my car, which I plan to pay off this year.  I paid off my student loans last year.  I use credit quite a lot as a traveling consultant and have a good credit history, so my rating is 815.  I rent, live by myself, and am generally somewhat frugal.  As a result my monthly expenses are quite low ($1500-2000) and I save a decent amount of money.  But only recently have I started to think more seriously about my retirement plan -- or lack thereof -- and how I should best be positioning myself.

Here are the current allocations in my retirement accounts:

* Wells Fargo Roth IRA is allocated to Growth Fund America Class A and Henderson International Opportunities Class C.
* American Funds 401k is allocated to American Funds 2055 Target Date-R2
* Fidelity SIMPLE IRA allocated to Fidelity Asset Manager 85

I as of yet do not hold any mutual funds/stocks/bonds/assets etc in any taxable investment account.  Despite my research, I'm not really sure where to 'start' investing with a brokerage account.  It all seems like a gamble to me, and I am also concerned about sinking too much money into what appears, to me atleast, to be an up market that's headed for a correction.  As far as stocks are concerned, I feel like buy and hold would have been an ideal strategy starting 5-10 years ago, but I'm not sure if it's a good market for new investors.  I'm more than willing to be convinced otherwise.

One question I have is: Should I been maxing out my contributions for all my retirement accounts, and leaving them to grow separately?  Or should I be maxing them out, and rolling them into my Roth IRA every year?  I have read varying opinions on this subject.  Some say diversity is better, while other say that by converting your other accounts to your Roth IRA you come out ahead and have a more tax-free retirement.  I'm also not sure where I stand on the implications of this for filing my yearly taxes.  Can someone please explain the benefits of the backdoor Roth IRA for my situation?  I'd be happy with a retirement income close to what I'm making now, or more, but am prioritizing early retirement.

Should I be buying a house and gaining equity that way?  This looks like more and more a good idea due to the loan interest rates being so low.

As far as goals, I really just want to grow my savings in the most responsible manner with the greatest stability, risk/reward, and retire as early as possible.  This type of question seems like standard fodder for /r/personalfinance, but please feel free to tell me how dumb I am for waiting this long to really give it the consideration it needs.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT:  People are seeming to think I meant I have employer matching to my traditional 401k.  That is not the case, I have employer matching to my SIMPLE IRA for a maximum contribution of 12.5k/year.

personalfinance,Retirement with a pension starting early,"Hi PF, I've read the retirement wiki, and looked at calculators, but I'm a bit overwhelmed and the results are varying wildly.

Here is my situation: my husband and I are career military. (enlisted) We have been moderately to quite successful; I am an E-7 with 14 years in, and my husband is an E-9 with 24 years in. We both have bachelors degrees, and he is currently pursuing a fellowship that will give him a masters degree at no cost. If I can find time, I will pursue a masters in my career field before I retire. At this time, our taxable income is a shade over $100k, while our actual gross is over $160k. We have zero credit card debt, all vehicles are paid off with no plans to buy new, and while we are currently supporting his teenaged college student daughter, we've warned her that our support will be limited. We have no children of our own. I own a house in NC, which is tax valued at $127k, but I could probably get $115k for it if I sold it. The house is rented out, and the income from rent covers all but $20 of the monthly mortgage. I am pushing hard to get it paid off, and if I really push it, the final payment should be in May '16. (I bought it in Jan '06) We each have small retirement accounts that contain between $35k and $50k.


In 4-6 years, we will retire from the military. My husband's estimated pension will be ~$4500/month starting in 2019, and mine will be ~2200/month starting in 2021. Ideally, we will transition to jobs that will pay the bills and let the pension pile up in investment accounts. In 2021, we will be 46 and 49 years old, with a good 15 years of work life ahead of us. Retiring for good around 2035 sounds good to me.

Most calculators ask for an investment portfolio and don't account for early pensions like ours. Additionally, I have been throwing ~$25k/year at the mortgage and my (admittedly luxury) car - I'll have at least 5 years of military pay to throw that much into investments - so I'm looking at transitioning from the military in 2021 with ~$275k in assets if you count the value of the house in there. 


So I guess my questions are: 

Is paying off the house the wrong answer? The interest rate is 5.625%; I bought before the housing bubble burst, and refinancing stopped being an option sometime in 2013 due to the fees being more than the interest saved on the remaining principal.


Given that I am steadfast about not touching that pension unless I have to (and I think my husband is on board with this) is it so horrible that I have less than six figures in retirement savings at this time? My current (traditional) IRA is giving a return of about 6%.


I know I need a financial adviser. I have resisted it because I don't have time, or I don't make enough to need it, but we're carrying probably $30k in our various checking accounts, and it could be working for us rather than being eaten away by inflation. So, PF, what would you do if you were me?",finance,1429396308
politics,Here's the letter gyrocopter pilot Doug Hughes was delivering to congress.,"Dear ___________,

Consider the following statement by John Kerry in his farewell speech to the Senate —

""The unending chase for money I believe threatens to steal our democracy itself. They know it. They know we know it. And yet, Nothing Happens!"" — John Kerry, 2-13

In a July 2012 Gallup poll, 87% tagged corruption in the federal government as extremely important or very important, placing this issue just barely behind job creation. According to Gallup, public faith in Congress is at a 41-year record low, 7%. (June 2014) Kerry is correct. The popular perception outside the DC beltway is that the federal government is corrupt and the US Congress is the major problem. As a voter, I’m a member of the only political body with authority over Congress. I’m demanding reform and declaring a voter’s rebellion in a manner consistent with Jefferson’s description of rights in the Declaration of Independence. As a member of Congress, you have three options.

1.	You may pretend corruption does not exist.

2.	You may pretend to oppose corruption while you sabotage reform.

3.	You may actively participate in real reform.

If you’re considering option 1, you may wonder if voters really know what the 'chase for money' is. Your dismal and declining popularity documented by Gallup suggests we know, but allow a few examples, by no means a complete list. That these practices are legal does not make them right! Obviously, it is Congress who writes the laws that make corruption legal.

1.	Dozens of major and very profitable corporations pay nothing in taxes. Voters know how this is done. Corporations pay millions to lobbyists for special legislation. Many companies on the list of freeloaders are household names — GE, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, Verizon, Citigroup, Dow …

2.	Almost half of the retiring members of Congress from 1998 to 2004 got jobs as lobbyists earning on average fourteen times their Congressional salary. (50% of the Senate, 42% of the House)

3.	The new democratic freshmen to the US House in 2012 were 'advised' by the party to schedule 4 hours per day on the phones fund raising at party headquarters (because fund raising is illegal from gov’t offices.) It is the donors with deep pockets who get the calls, but seldom do the priorities of the rich donor help the average citizen.

4.	The relevant (rich) donors who command the attention of Congress are only .05% of the public (5 people in a thousand) but these aristocrats of both parties are who Congress really works for. As a member of the US Congress, you should work only for The People.

1.	Not yourself.

2.	Not your political party.

3.	Not the richest donors to your campaign.

4.	Not the lobbyist company who will hire you after your leave Congress.

There are several credible groups working to reform Congress. Their evaluations of the problem are remarkably in agreement though the leadership (and membership) may lean conservative or liberal. They see the corrupting effect of money — how the current rules empower special interests through lobbyists and PACs — robbing the average American of any representation on any issue where the connected have a stake. This is not democracy even if the ritual of elections is maintained.

The various mechanisms which funnel money to candidates and congress-persons are complex. It happens before they are elected, while they are in office and after they leave Congress. Fortunately, a solution to corruption is not complicated. All the proposals are built around either reform legislation or a Constitutional Amendment. Actually, we need both — a constitutional amendment and legislation.

There will be discussion about the structure and details of reform. As I see it, campaign finance reform is the cornerstone of building an honest Congress. Erect a wall of separation between our elected officials and big money. This you must do — or your replacement will do. A corporation is not 'people' and no individual should be allowed to spend hundreds of millions to 'influence' an election. That much money is a megaphone which drowns out the voices of 'We the People.' Next, a retired member of Congress has a lifelong obligation to avoid the appearance of impropriety. That almost half the retired members of Congress work as lobbyists and make millions of dollars per year smells like bribery, however legal. It must end. Pass real campaign finance reform and prohibit even the appearance of payola after retirement and you will be part of a Congress I can respect.

The states have the power to pass a Constitutional Amendment without Congress — and we will. You in Congress will likely embrace the change just to survive, because liberals and conservatives won’t settle for less than democracy. The leadership and organization to coordinate a voters revolution exist now! New groups will add their voices because the vast majority of Americans believe in the real democracy we once had, which Congress over time has eroded to the corrupt, dysfunctional plutocracy we have.

The question is where YOU individually stand. You have three options and you must choose.

Sincerely,

Douglas M. Hughes",finance,1429396903

I'm self-employed which makes the whole thing messier. Basically I only made about $4k in 2014 after deductions, but I'm on pace to make ~$70k gross this year.

My current debts are:
~9k in credit cards
$20k on car
$13k to Navient/Sallie Mae in private student loans
$50k to Nelnet (federal student loans)

Those are really my only expenses, and once Navient and Credit cards are paid off my expenses are less than $1k a month.

I'm planning to pay off the credit cards and Navient by August or September.

Basically my dilemma is that I have to move, but I won't be able to have a big down payment. Renting is pretty much out of the question (2 large German Shepherds, 2 cats) and rental rates in Asheville and the surrounding area are brutal right now for anything that would be big enough and even consider the possibility of the animals.

I should be able to save up about $15k for a down payment by December. Most of the houses that meet my needs are in the $190-225k range, so I would have to look at an FHA loan.

So my question is will I even be able to get my foot in the door for a loan? If not would it help if I moved to Asheville sooner and rented a small apartment and got a crappy part time job just to show a more stable income and then bring the dogs and cats when my original move time comes? I have a worthless BA (Journalism) and my income is very contingent on working at least 50 hours a week... the more I work the more money I make. Or am I just screwed?

Food is very expensive, even for basics where I am at so it will very slightly on how much I spend. I try to eat healthy so it tends to cost a bit more.

Credit Card bills I pay over the minimal, usually 100 or more a month. CC 2 is only so large because of a recent move and the security deposit was placed on it. Will drop down shortly.

3000 in saving

Then alternating each check, one goes into saving, the other goes towards debt reduction, with me paying of the loan first.

personalfinance,24 &amp; Credit Card Clueless,"Hello!
So I'll be turning 24 this year and I'm getting ready to move in with my girlfriend in January 2016.  I'm trying to get my life in order a little bit before making the move to start my new life with someone.  I had a couple questions that involve debt/credit cards that I'd love some answers too. 

I only have one credit card.  I only have about $350 worth of debt on it, that I pay off, $50 a month.
Now I can pay off the whole thing in full, but I'm trying to build up my credit, so I pay off a little bit every month so each month my credit rises by a few points.  

Is this a smart move?  Or am I better off just paying it off in full so I can get my maximum credit points?  It's a student card, so I have like zero to no interest on it.  But last June-August I missed three months of payment because I'm an idiot, and my credit score went down a lot.  I haven't missed a payment yet tho and never plan to again.

I dont charge anything to the card anymore.  It actually expired, and they sent me a new card, but I never activated it because I wanted to make sure I paid it off first, and not be tempted to charge anything else.  So should I pay it off in full or continue to make the $50-$100/month payments that I have been making in order to bring up my credit?

My other question involves Taxes Owed / A New Card

So the only other debt I have is some tax debt.  It's not a huge amount, but because I'm self employed I end up owing taxes at the end of the year.  I missed a few tax seasons these last few years, but I ended up getting caught up this month and filing everything that needed to be filed.  I called the IRS, checked in with them, they said we're cool, and they're putting me on a payment plan to pay off what I owe.  
I owe about $8000 in taxes.  Not a huge amount, but not pocket change either.
I wanted to know what the best way to go about this would be?  I can afford to pay at least $100 a month, but I'm going to work overtime and try to pay at least $300-$500 of it off a month.  
I was wondering if I should get a credit card and charge the monthly payment to the card?  Of course I would pay the card off in full every month, but I wanted to know if this would be a smart move so I can kill two birds with one stone and pay off my tax debt while raising my credit score…
What are your thoughts on this??

Also, if the credit card route is the way to go (cause I really want to build up my credit before moving into a new place next year with my GF, so theirs no trouble when it comes to applying) what credit card should I go with?  
I know all credit cards give different rewards and have different interest rates, and caps.  But what I'm looking for is basically a card that has really little interest, has a $500-$1000 cap, and although reward points aren't required for me to choose that card, if its too good to turn down, I'm open to it.  I've only had one student credit card (which is now expired), so I'm pretty clueless.

* $1200 'cash advances', &amp; $300 'purchases'?

investing,Are the US markets truly overvalued and due for a correction or is it relatively speaking fairly priced especially in regards to bonds and other asset classes?,"The argument about whether the US stock markets are overpriced is one that splits many experts in finance. 


Is the market overpriced or is it that it is fair priced considering the returns of bonds and cash. Those who argue that the markets are not over priced will say that in actual fact everything is relative. Many asset classes are substitutes for each other and different asset classes have different risks. If the risk “free return” attained from either bonds or cash is very extremely low. Then stocks, which return 5 percent for example look very attractive. The idea is that whilst stocks are somewhat pricy at current prices, they still return using conservatively estimated DCF models several percentage points above the risk free return of 0.02 percent return of US 10 week corporate bonds. Thus people are willing to pay historically somewhat inflated prices for what historically would have been a lower return. However, this is because bonds yields and interest rates are so low not because there is a problem with sentiment.

 Anyway this is one of the arguments to justify the bull market and it continued life. Personally, I at this point I am not really sure about the immediate future of the stock markets as there are convincing arguments on both sides. What do you guys think?",finance,1429435747

personalfinance,Student Loan Forbearance to Pay Credit Card Debt?,"Hi All.  Quick question as I can't decide what to do.  As a result of a messy divorce and complicated situation I have about 30k in credit card debt on three cards.  I also have about $100k in student loan debts from grad school.  My average payment for student loans is $750 a month.  The interest rate is relatively low on all of my debt so I don't really see that as a factor.  If I put off my student loans on a voluntary forbearance for 1 year, I would be able to pay off one of the credit cards in its entirety -- but that money would simply be added on to my student loan debt which is already going to take years to pay off.  

My tldr question:  Is it worth a 1 year forbearance on the student loans to pay off a credit card? I could then apply the monthly credit card payments towards the others.  I appreciate your help!",finance,1429452554

personalfinance,Searching For Financial Advice Early In My Career,"Hello, All. 

I am looking for some financial guidance on what moves I should be making in the near future and long term regarding financial decisions. 

Here is my story: 

I am a 24 year old recent college graduate with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. After graduating in April 2014, I accepted a job offer with a large company. My job position and company seem stable as of now. 

My starting salary is around $55,000. 

The company offers a competitive low-ish cost health/dental/vision benefits package. They also offer life insurance up to double your salary at no charge. 

My company offers a pre-tax traditional 401k option and a Roth 401k option. The company will match up to 5% on either option. The company’s match automatically goes into a pre-tax 401k. I currently choose to transfer 15% of my paycheck into the Roth 401k option. My two week take home pay is roughly $1250 after 401k deduction. 

I am about to move into my first post graduation apartment in a few months. I predict my rent and utilities bill combined to be anywhere from $750 to $1000. 

Current Assets: 

I’d like to first mention that I have no credit card debt. I use my credit card for every day purchases and pay it off typically multiple times per month. I have managed to accrue around $1000 in cash back rewards. 

I have some PMs but not much… (A few ounces of gold and around 100 ounces of silver) 

Savings account: $5,000 cash 

Checking account: $3,000 cash 

Company Roth 401k: $8000 vested / $11,000 total (50% 2055 target fund / 50% aggressive allocation fund) 

Personal Roth IRA : $1000 (rollover from previous internship’s 401k, I think I have this in a dated target fund as well) 

Mutual Fund: $1000 (tried to invest in high school) 

Current Debt: 

Upon graduation, I had around $25,000 in college loans with variable interest rates. I have paid these loans down to a balance around $15,000. My loan rates vary from 3.91% to 5%. My minimum payment that is required of me is around a $200 a month. I have it set to automatically withdraw a $500 payment every month. Occasionally, I can afford to apply a larger principal payment when my savings builds up. 

I purchased a new Subaru Impreza in May 2014. The sticker price on the car was around $22-23,000. I traded a 05 Chevy Colorado in on this. The trade was valued at $6,000. The loan has a life of 6 years or 72 months. The rate of the loan is 1.9% APR. I currently owe around $15,000 on this loan. I continue to pay the minimum payment on this loan, as the interest rate is so low. 

Questions: 

I would like to track my monthly living expenditures. I currently live with the motto buy what I need to get by and put the rest into savings. Does anyone recommend an app (mint.com) or system to track my monthly expenses so I know where I stand? 

I would like to have an emergency savings account to fall back on to. I know the “experts” recommend 6 months of living expenses but I have faint idea of how much money that would be. Any suggestions? 

Is it more important for me to pay off my student loan debt than to build an emergency savings account? 

I am pretty sure this is a no brainer but should I continue to pay off my higher interest student loans before my lower interest car loan? 

I know I missed the 2014 IRA deadline but should I max my personal IRA out for 2015 even if I am still participating in my companies Roth 401k at 15% per paycheck? 

I know I will have more questions as I am sure I forgot some things... 

Thanks, I appreciate any advice! 

PS.

When looking at my employer's 401K, it lists the various options I can invest in such as: 

+Morley Stable Value Cl 45-II 

+Wells Fargo/BlackRock S&amp;P500 Idx CIT N 

+American Beacon Small Cap Value Inv 

+American Funds Europacific Growth R4 

+Dodge &amp; Cox Stock

How do you even determine on where to start when it comes to deciding on which funds to choose to add up to 100% of your investment ?

personalfinance,Tax Withholding vs. Paying Student Loans,"Hello,

I have two questions. I graduated in 2013 with 37k in debt. My account was handed to a third party company and split into 7 sections. It took me a while to get a steady job and my life in order, by which time the 90-day and 120-day mark had passed, leading to 14 late payments being reported, which severely affected my credit score. This happened over a year ago, but my credit score has barely if at all risen since then. I paid off one of the loans and its status is updated as 'Closed', and my total debt is not 29k.

My first question is how I can get the third party company to reduce or remove the amount of payments that show up on my report. I've asked them about it multiple times but they say things it's policy to honestly report what happened and it'll drop off in 7 years... they've told me people in similar situations do things like loan consolidating to prevent this situation, but it's too late in my situation. 

I guess I was stupid for somehow being more aware that this company's policy was to report late payments at 90 and 120 days, because I definitely did not realize the urgency. However they said I have been in good standing for over a year and considering this, now I am seeing their inaction to help me as a betrayal of their customer / client. I think I can pay these loans off soon (see below) but maybe they think I will be with them over 7 years - I've paid minimum up until a 5k lump sum a month ago (yeah tax returns).

**Edit**: Apparently, some companies do payment removal, but it goes against the system, this particular company is under no obligation to, and they choose not to.

My other question is that I am getting a well-paying (above 100k) job in the SF area, and I'd like to rent a cheap (sub-1000) apartment while I pay off my loans. Is it legal during this time to report as many allowances as possible and basically underpay on taxes for 2015 until my loans are paid? Using this method, I could completely take care of my loans this year and I'd have time to make up the difference between January and April. Or is this kind of practice frowned upon? I just kind of want to put my loans behind me and hopefully the company would be more likely to clear them from my credit record. I am also pretty fed up with getting excessive withholding and getting large tax returns (over 3k for the past two years). Most of my student loans are accumulating interest at about 6.5% so getting this money later hurts me. I also think I would need to over-report allowances a little for the rest of 2015 regardless since I'll be inaccurately taxed as if I am making 100k the whole year 

**Edit**: It looks like this is frowned upon but if I enter my info in a federal withholding allowance calculator, it will spit me out a number that should average out the discrepency over the rest of 2015

Thanks! Also realized I never took a second look at the title, my apologies if it isn't a good description

**Edit**: Thanks all! I guess I will just have relatively shitty credit until I'm 31, but hopefully it'll be largely meaningless and not prevent me from living my life.",finance,1429466938

personalfinance,Need 8K for rent payment while studying abroad.,"hey guys, I'm hoping someone here will have some good advice for me. I've run into a bit of a problem with my housing payments for my study abroad trip - my estimated cost of attendance is less than the cost of housing in the UK, and I've already maxed out my federal loans and my mother has a federal PLUS loan for the remainder of my cost of attendance.

I've already emailed my financial aid officer and asked if the latter is even possible, and I'm in talks with my local branch to see if my own lack of employment can be ignored without getting a co-signer, as I have few if any viable co-signer options.

personalfinance,Is a job offer with lower salary (2k less) and lesser retirement plan in a lower cost of living city worth it?,"Details.

Currently federally employed (6 years) at a Gs-12 step 4 in the greater washington dc area (bethesda/rockville md).  Making 84 k, + pension, TSP (410k) where they match 100% up to 5% of salary and kick in an additional 1%.  Currently I commit 7% of paycheck, I get a total of 13%

Pension details.  If I were to complete a federal career, it would be 1.1% of the average of my highest paid 3 years, per year of service. At a minimum this would be 33% of 115k (more likely to be 125-135K) for life after retirement per year.  I am now vested, so if I were to leave I would receive 6% of ~80k per year for life at retirement.

The offer is for 82 k in Pittsburgh PA. Their retirement is 3% of salary given to a mutual fund, with an additional 1% per 10 years of service, in addition to a 401 k where they match 50% up to 8%.  So this represents a massive cut in retirement savings compared to the federal plan.   Health plans comparison is pretty much even.  

The only reason why I am considering the offer is the DRASTIC cost of living reduction in Pitt vs DC.  E.g, I will NEVER be able to afford a single family home in the dc area, a town home that will put my gf and I within a reasonable commute will cost around 500k (GF's job will fully transfer, 105k/yr).  A 3 br 2 bath home in pittsburgh can be had for 200k, and that buys a nice one.

We're going to try something a bit different for the article of the week series for a bit. Rather than running the monthly nominations thread, we're just going to look at the top paper submitted to /r/econpapers the previous week, and use that.

There are basically two reasons for this:

1.) We'd like to promote /r/econpapers a bit - it's a great subreddit that is looking for more activity!
2.) I don't think that I've done a great job of running the nominations thread - it's just a little bit too inactive. We only usually get about the 4 submissions we would need to make the week. It's also means that we can sometime get into trouble - I forget to post it one week, which means we don't have something ready to go the next week. I'm hoping that this will mean we always have a good 'default' paper ready to go, with a little bit of conversation ready to seed it.

[Paper](http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2013-08.pdf)

Abstract:

&gt; We introduce a model of monetary policy with downward nominal wage rigidities and show that both the slope and curvature of the Phillips curve depend on the level of inflation and the extent of downward nominal wage rigidities. This is true for the both the long-run and the short-run Phillips curve. Comparing simulation results from the model with data on U.S. wage patterns, we show that downward nominal wage rigidities likely have played a role in shaping the dynamics of unemployment and wage growth during the last three recessions and subsequent recoveries.

&gt;http://imgur.com/a/tjzgT

These two images are absolute concrete proof that Sony/MPAA are lobbying governments to push the TPP/TTIP's extensive copyright laws. One part reads, 
&gt;""Finally, in regards to trade, the MPAA/MPA with the strong support of your studios, continue to advocate to governments around the world about the pressing need for strong pro-IP trade policies such as TPP and the proposed EU/US trade agreement (TTIP)""

This here is concrete proof that corporations globally are pushing laws for their own profit at the expense of the people, this will be basically SOPA/CISPA on steroids. 

But wait there's more, they even said that they have formed an,
&gt;""MPAA/Studio working group to study and develop the next generation of criminal enforcement strategies to present to federal prosecutors"".

This is worse than we thought /r/technology, not only have the MPAA influenced and crafted some of the strictest copyright laws in the history of the internet for its own gain, they have been put in charge of implementing the punishments for breaking these laws.

This whole deal is completely beyond repair and needs to be shot down, but with the majority of the world economy on board, it seems like it will be a difficult task.

Bare in mind that the TPP not only includes copyright, but it will allow corporations to [sue governments](http://www.democracynow.org/2015/3/26/headlines/wikileaks_reveals_tpp_proposal_allowing_corporations_to_sue_nations) for 'cutting into their future profits' and to get the countries to repeal laws like environmental and food safety standards to maximise profits. As seen on wikileaks about the TPP:
&gt;...WikiLeaks has released the ""Investment Chapter,"" which highlights the intent of U.S.-led negotiators to create a tribunal where corporations can sue governments if their laws interfere with a company’s claimed future profits.

And as I'm sure it's a sensitive topic of discussion right now, the UK will likely lose the NHS as well since this also allows US pharmaceutical companies to sue governments.

For those who don't know about the TPP/TTIP, they are trade agreements between major world powers that are currently being negotiated in complete secrecy with corporations playing a big role. We only know most of what we do because of wikileaks:

personalfinance,I've saved up a pretty decent chunk of change - should I buy a car with cash or finance?,"Just a little background on my financial situation: Over the past 6 months, I've been working really hard to find ways to save money since I recently received a raise &amp; know that I will be getting a few larger expenses over the next few months. Currently, I have an apartment that is INSANELY cheap, but I can only live here until August, and after that point, I will have to move somewhere where I will be paying about double in rent since I'll be moving out on my own instead of sharing a tiny space with 3 other people. My student loans (approximately $30,000) will also begin requiring payment in November, though I don't have the details on those payments yet. 

Another big expense coming my way is a new car. Mine is currently about as old as I am (and I'm graduating from college this May) and is on its last legs. I know that the next repair I need to do on my car will be more expensive than the car is worth (it's worth *maybe* $1,000 in a trade-in, and I've put in close to $300 to just keep the little guy running. 

**My current dilemma:** I'm looking at a new car valued at about $15,000 (and BOY do I love it!!), and I currently have about $10,000 saved, and I can save another $5,000 over the next 2-3 months with my current expenses. I know I can negotiate the price of the car down, but I'm wondering if it makes sense to finance the car with a 3-4% interest rate and then pay off something else first/build my credit/learn to invest? or if I should just buy it with cash outright so I have one less expense to worry about. 

Any advice? I'm not in any hurry (looking to buy in the late summer - probably August/September), but I want to figure out my options early so I have time to research all of the possibilities.

personalfinance,"I'm 23, a medically retired veteran, and I'm going to receive lots of disability for the rest of my life. Any suggestions?","Title says most of it...
I just got out of the military late last year due to medical retirement, and I've been awarded 100% disability compensation - which comes out to be about 2900 dollars a month untaxed for the rest of my life. I was pretty rough with my money while in the military, as most people are my age, but recently since I started to receive the disability I've cracked down on myself pretty good. My assets are: a paid off dodge charger, which according to mint is worth about 10 grand, a newly opened and maxed out Roth IRA, and about 2 grand in the bank. I do not have a job, but in addition to the disability income I just started my first semester of school with the GI bill, which in Orlando I get about 1300 a month per month I am in school - and I don't plan on doing summer school so that's about 8 months out of the year. 

I just moved to Orlando, and the housing price is quite a shock coming from much more expensive Baltimore, so I plan on following in my father's, and his father's footsteps and getting into real estate. Given that I qualify for no down payment and low interest rate VA loans, and the disability will exempt me from up to 5k property tax per year, I'd say, and my father says, that now is a good time to do it. I definitely wouldn't do this so quickly if I wasn't able to tap into their 80 something years of combined experience though, that's for sure. 

So PF, what do you think? I plan on buying a house now, and many more in the future, and maxing out a Roth IRA for the rest of my life. Is there anything you can see here that is glaringly wrong?

My wife has a history of post-partum depression and with 4 other kids running around, she’s going to need help and I’m not going to be able to help her at all (residency got its name because new doctors were required to live in the hospital essentially making them residents there).

 * Income Based Repayment (IBR) + Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) = low loan payments and forgiveness in 10 years
 * Loan Payments are based on Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) -&gt; get AGI as low as possible
 * Concern the PSLF program will be canceled are not supported by history or law (basically, IF it changed we would be guaranteed to be grandfathered in so nothing would change)

I’m thinking about starting my loan payments during residency (which will be $0 a month, I also don’t pay federal taxes, dependents are great!) to start the PSLF payments as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to max my IRA and 401k contributions.

So how does everything look? Where do I go from here? Am I overlooking anything? Any advice is appreciated.

**Some background:**

I am currently a senior in high school and am going to attend a state university in August. Luckily my financial aid will pay for it with government loans As of present I have 9000 in loans every year. Of this 9000 5 would be subsidized and 4 would be unsubsidized pending changes in govt funding. I am also waiting on several private scholarships to be awarded and depending if I receive them the 9000 per year would go down. 

With my current bank balance and assuming I am awarded no further scholarships what would be the best way to make my 6 grand pay for my schooling. I looked into a certificate of deposit from ally bank as they have some higher interest rates and I wouldn't necessarily need instant access to the money.

**the question**

Is there a more efficient way to grow my money to pay for what might be 40 grand of debt when I'm finished with undergrad?

&gt;With 6 grand stored for 5 years cokpunding daily I would have upwards of 16k and that's without adding any money too it (which I would) 

In my rudimentary planning I figured that if I were to make 2.5 grand a month for 10 months working in school then 4 for 2 months out of school and paid the interest off my unsubsidized and put the rest into the CD, it would pay off my undergrad by the time I was out of school.

personalfinance,Acceptable student loan amount - future debt/income ratio as a guide?,"Hi Personal Finance!

TL;DR,  what is an acceptable amount of student loan debt with relationship to future income? Please disregard careers with easy 6 figure student loans (doctors, dentists) to keep this simple. I'm looking for something like: If you were going to make $50,000 after graduation, you should keep your loan under X amount. Is there a recommended %?  Or is there a recommended % per month, and I can work up from there?

I read PF a lot, and I know debt=bad, but I want to be realistic. I work with underprivileged teens (9th/10th grade in the US) who will have no money going into college. Statistically speaking, if they attempt to work and save, they will never go to college/trade school/higher ed. We are currently talking about college and they've spent a couple days exploring what colleges look like, what they cost, what you can do in a college (besides school work), and all sorts of other things. We've also talked about 2 year degrees and trade schools. They are going to be starting a project where they have to pick a college, explain why they chose that college, create a 4 year plan, and *explain how they will finance it*. 

Up until now, my big push has been to ignore the $ and focus on the education while exploring schools and majors. All of the students are low-income minorities with residency, so federal aid will be a very good possibility. We've talked about grant/scholarships and the importance of grades. The goal has always been transparent: work your ass off, apply everywhere that interests you, and see how the money pans out. Community college is absolutely on the table for discussion, which is why we're doing a 4 year plan. How will they transition from Point A to Point B? There is a lot of buy in - students realized that this whole college thing is a giant mindfuck in terms of navigating websites and trying to find out what you need to know. I want them to do the hard shit now so when it counts ""for real"", they have a good idea of what they are doing. 

I absolutely do not want any of these kids taking out $80,000 worth of loans to end up with a degree that lands them a slightly more than minimum wage job. However, a kindergarten teacher is going to make less than a mechanical engineer. 80k on an engineer's salary is going to look and feel different than 80k on a kindergarten teacher's salary, you know?

personalfinance,Strategy on Student Loans - Am I Doing it Right?,"So, I'm going into my senior year of university, and I've maintained a very manageable amount of student loans given my job prospects after graduation. I have around $10,000 of loans out at the moment, all through the federal government, and all at interest rates of around 4%. I plan to go onto graduate school but my field and academic background give me an excellent change of getting funding at a decent program, so I'm not really worried about needing additional loans in graduate school.

My loans are currently split with around $6k in subsidized loans and $4k in unsubsidized loans. I really hated having to take out unsubsidized loans, but I had no real choice because my financial aid package sucked this year. Luckily, my brother has since gone to college, which bumped my financial aid package way up. Having two children within a household in college at the same time is great for financial aid.

I do not need any loans next semester, but I'm considering taking around $4k subsidized loans out anyway. My plan with these funds is to leave around $1k in my bank account as a cushion in the event that I have car trouble, etc. that forces me to shell out unexpected amounts of cash. I already have a small cushion in there, but adding in another $1k would make me feel more comfortable with my situation. If I have no situation arise, I can always pay off the $1k in loans before any interest accrues, because they are subsidized.

I plan to use the remaining $3k to pay down the unsubsidized loans, to stop them from continuing to accrue interest.

Is there anything wrong with this strategy? I don't think there is, but before I take out $4k in loans that I don't need, strictly speaking, I wanted to run it past some people to see what others think.",finance,1429502652
Bitcoin,When did you realize the true value in Bitcoin and Blockchain tech?,"Like the title says, I'm curious when people here first realized the true value/magnitude of this technology and what was the trigger.

For me, it was today because the pieces finally fell into place. I got around to watching Antonopoulos' 2 hour testifing to Canadian Senate from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/32arv5/what_5_videos_should_everyone_new_to_bitcoin_watch/).

Up until watching that, I had purchased some Bitcoin, and messed around with it because I had simply heard it was decentralized. I'm pretty libertarian so supporting the growth of something decentralized was really attractive to me. It wasn't until today that Bitcoin became more to me than that.

I told my girlfriend that I watched that video and she looked at me like I was crazy. I slowly walked through the basics of blockchain and bitcoin (probably not super great since I'm new) and compared it to today's monetary system. That was really the epiphany moment for me because I've been an advocate for another gold based (or other precious metal based) economy. I've already understood how screwed up today's system is because I've done my due diligence with some Ludwig von Mises, John Maynard Keynes, etc (you have to know both sides of an opinion). Putting the pieces together that Bitcoin is a sort of gold (but better), and it is simply the reward from a more compelling technology was the one-two punch for me. Learning that decentralization, blockchain, and bitcoin could create a world with so much less central authority and do it in such an elegant manner was mind-boggling.

I think the best part was that during this conversation with her she had never heard that the Fed exists because it was made by bankers, for bankers. That her money isn't to her benefit, its really for someone else and she gets the scraps. Hearing that Bitcoin is money that is yours, and no one elses, was really attractive to her.

I'm trying to make amends with my past and start over. I recently got a job that pays better than anything I've had in the past and can actually start saving money to pay off past debt/loans.

I graduated from New England Institute of Art a year and a half ago and was able to get a contract Web Development job a few months after I graduated. That held me over for about three months and then struggled looking for something due to lack of experience. During this time I was working retail and and scraping by living in Boston. I had credit card debt while in school and had no problem keeping up and paying for them until my loans started coming in and at that point I couldn't afford to pay either.

Being out of work and only working retail pushed a couple of my loans to collections and on the final straw with Sallie Mae and Chase. 

-MEFA (private loan) pushed my loans to a law office that I am making monthly payments to.
- I was able to make a payment plan with Sallie Mae and Chase to hold me over.
- My federal loans are on income based repayment and currently have a $0 payment.

So my student loans are somewhat taken care of for the time being. My next issue is Credit cards/ collections.

I have one card still active that I haven't used and  to making minimum payments on.  $11,000 limit and I have have close to $10,000 on it.

In collections I have :

$7500 BOA credit card
$3200 visa 
$350 
$147 cable bill ( old roommates left me with a bill I couldn't pay)

What should I focus on first? I have about $1000 in saving, should I knock out the smaller collection amounts first? I am going to setup a budget when I get home so I can start rebuilding my credit ( currently @ 570 )

personalfinance,Adjustable rate loan timing - as dumb as market timing?,"OK, the general consensus on /r/personalfinance is that trying to time the market is not possible for those of us who are not investing gurus.  So don't do it!  I agree with that.

But, I have a home equity line of credit with an adjustable mortgage rate.  Right now we are paying 3.25%, which I would happily pay forever while investing my spare cash elsewhere.  Over time I can beat that number with an investment allocation I am comfortable with. With the minimum and the amount I owe we have no problem paying the minimum every month, but the minimums are basically 99.9% interest.  

But, it seems inevitable that the fed interest rate is going to go up.  Either in June or December, its going to go up 1/2 a percent maybe.  Now, 3.75%, I will also happily pay forever while investing.  But if it gets into the mid 4%, or god forbid 5%, then all of a sudden my nice debt has turned into a pain in the ass debt that I will probably want rid of.  We are careful not to get into credit card debt and I don't want this HELOC to become a problem.

So which of these three options is best:

1. Invest any extra money we have in index funds and wait at least a year, knowing that in two or three years, we might want to sell, pay long term capital gains, and get rid of the loan.  If it matters, we are in the income bracket where we would pay 15% long term capital gains.  *Bonus question*:  Is there a safe investment option that is a hedge against rising interest rates?  It seems like total international stock funds maybe since rising rates means a rising dollar, but that isn't conservative enough for money I might need in a couple years?

1. Hold extra money in my emergency fund.  If rates go up, you have it pay off the loan, if rates don't go up, you have it to do something else with later.  Most flexibility but lose out on 3.25%.

1. Just start paying off the loan now, getting the guaranteed 3.25% return.

* I'm eligible for $5,500 in direct subsidized, the rest unsub (at least for this year, I don't know how to predict what I'll be eligible for in following years)
* $2,500 will be covered in scholarships, I've applied to a lot more but haven't heard back yet

Obligatory Financially Stupid Personal Choices:

* Assumed a lease on a car in 2012 from a family friend when I had a soul-sucking but well-paying full-time job

* I already have a degree and a shit ton in loans.  I made the choice to change careers because of a shift in personal values.  Previous degree would have meant a life of academia in a subject I was growing frustrated with, by the time I graduated I realized that I had very different life goals than I started with.


Option One:

* Stay at engineering firm where I have been working part-time since June.  I started as a co-op and still make the same $/hr, but I am confident that I could get a raise if I presented a good argument.
*  Full-time employees are eligible for complete tuition reimbursement up to $20,000 a school year.  It's likely that I will be hired full-time here within the next year if I stay.  There are at least 3 other employees in the building who were hired this way.
* When I work 32 hours a week, I can only take a max of three classes (2 ENGR, 1 fluff requirement) if I want to maintain sanity.  I've experimented with more and this is my personal limit.
* Classes are offered unpredictably so I like the flexibility of part-time if a best-fit class is only offered during the day.
* This method could take anywhere from 3-5 more years to complete my degree.  I've been in school my entire life minus one year in 2012.  I'm definitely burning out on not having any kind of social life besides my live-in boyfriend and the occasional skype with my 2 out-of state best friends.  Being a commuter student is lonely.

Option Two:

* Work only during the summer like a traditional co-op to save some money for full-time classes during the school year.
* Be done in 2-3 years
* Worry about being replaced at work.  I could always get a different job, but this place is special to me, laid back, gives me the freedom to work on subjects that interest me as long as I complete my core responsibilities.

My understanding is they will cap my payments at a certain percentage of my salary. Its possible becuase my payments are so high to start with though, that my new payments may not cover the interest.

Luckly, this is it for my debt, which I know is a lot better than most people. The problem is I was hoping to pursue a bachelors degree at a local state college. If I spend 7100+3000= 10,100 I will have only 3k remaining. That will barely pay for one semester of school.   
  
It seems obvious, ""pay off the credit card and car and deal with student loans and FAFSA for the school"".   
  
My only concern is my wife's spending habits. I will admit, about half of that debt is from emergency use when we were unemployed, but also the other half is her careless spending. **I told her that if I'm using this inheritance to pay off the CC debt, then we are CLOSING the CC accounts. She argues that she wants them for ""emergency"" and she fears her credit score will go down if she closes CC accounts.**  
  
I understand her logic but is it really worth keeping cards with such a high interest rate?? What is better, 3000 available unused credit that is burning a hole in her pocket or canceling those cards? I should specify the CC are all in her name.",finance,1429545191

-About $85,000 to $90,000 a year combined income (low 50's from me, mid-30's from her. Pre-tax).

-No debt, total ~$14,000 emergency fund and some retirement accounts (~35k), but only 8k saved for down payment at this time

-Should be able to save 1.5-2k a month while we search for a home (just finished paying off 60k student loans, hence the small savings at this time)

-Late 20's, plan to stay in current small city (low/mid cost of living) for many years and potentially start a family in the next couple years. City is relatively stable economically and housing-price wise.

-Thinking of homes in the 200k range. (We were pre-approved for way more, but can't imagine touching the upper end of our pre-approval)

What I'd appreciate feedback on: 
I'm unhappy with my current job and would like to make a switch in the next year or 2. I expect that leaving my current field (engineering) for something unrelated would likely result in a pay drop. I would not leave my current job without another one lined up, and one that payed at least 30k. Would it be absolutely foolish to buy a house before I figure this out? 

Because we are aiming for a mortgage payment below our current means, have emergency funds, and interest rates are low, I feel like the idea of switching jobs isn't deterring me as much as it should. I also feel that if I switched jobs prior to taking out a mortgage, our credit score and subsequent interest rate would suffer.

Part of me thinks I am ok going forward, while another part of me thinks I ought to wait until I am happy with my current career-situation. Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: Thanks all for the feedback, keep it coming if you got it. Sounds like we'd better cool the jets a little, and at the very least save up more before taking on a mortgage and everything else associated. Also clarified a little up top.",finance,1429554998

Clearly, what is reasonable amount of debt seems to be based on what your degree is in. My question is what would be a simple rule of thumb without getting too vague. For example, should it be only take out what your starting salary would be? Or max potential?

Of course, this question hits home. I'm in school for engineering, and I'll be graduating with roughly $50K in loans (only federal). However, median starting salary in my field is $60K, and grows rapidly with experience.",finance,1429556754

personalfinance,(CAN) Getting a student line of credit without a co-signer.,"I (19F) am in my second year of university and am studying nursing. My parents (50s M&amp;F) are quite wealthy, and have therefore agreed to pay for all of my tuition and school expenses. However, I am responsible for covering my own living expenses (approx. $800/month). This is non-negotiable, and living at home is not an option as I go to school in another province. 

Thus far, I have been working part-time (20 hours/week) in order to support myself. I was also able to pick up more hours over Christmas and have saved up $1000 this year. Along with this, I will be working full-time this summer and should be able to save up another $3000 or so. I have also received a scholarship for $1300 which will be going directly toward my living expenses next year.

That said, I am still about $1100 short for my living expenses next year. My parents are very much against debt, and will not co-sign a student line of credit for me. I am also unable to get a federal or provincial student loan because of how much money my parents make. My courses will be much more difficult in the coming years, and I would very much prefer to avoid working part-time through school from here on out. My question is- is there even a slight possibility that I would be able to get a student line of credit without a co-signer at this point? If not, what are some ways I can up my chances? 

I have recently gotten a credit card to try and build up my credit. I use it to make small purchases here and there (coffee or breakfast) and pay the entire balance off each month. I also have a cellphone in my name, which I always pay on time.

Should I just bite the bullet and work through school, or is a student line of credit within reach? Also, does the fact that I am a 90's student in a field with decent job opportunities/pay make any difference when applying for a loan? Any advice is appreciated! 

Edit: I should also mention that my parents have about $75,000 worth of investments in my name (legally). Will this affect my ability to get a loan?",finance,1429557651

economy,IMF tells regulators to brace for global 'liquidity shock',"It's the economy, no it's the debt, no it's the derivatives.  Citigroup Chief Economist Willem Buiter recently called for the elimination of cash which would also include higher forms of taxation on currency, among other unpleasantries for the populace.  While he might think this to be a very nice idea for his bank and the US Government, we think not so nice for the rest of us.  But what is the problem really?  After all, the various pundits in the US Government and in various media seem to tell us things are looking up.  However, Bloomberg News asks (as part of the sub-heading in the article about the Buiter comments): Would this save the world economy?   Honestly, if you listen to some other economic commentaries, it would seem the world economy was already saved – or was it?

The existing real problem of too much debt, too much leverage and exponential use of unregulated (and uncollateralized) derivatives seems to be finally coming home to roost.   The new problem seems to be a lack of liquidity once again, and a lack of collateral – despite all of the QE programs, running of the printing presses (electronically of course) and other initiatives designed to starve off disaster.

Mr. Dave Kranzler from Investment Research Dynamics recently highlighted the unusual and exponential use of US Treasury Repo operations recently, leading him to conclude the US Federal Reserve is doing this to once again prop up the banks to coverage margin calls on derivatives (giving them Treasury securities to cover the additional margin).   Interesting enough, with regards to the individual investor, the IMF says that: Margin debt as a percentage of market capitalisation remains higher than it was during the late-1990s stock market bubble. The increasing use of margin debt is occurring in an environment of declining liquidity. 

Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, says the U.S. dollar’s rise won’t persist because the national economy is staggering and the Federal Reserve is going to delay, yet again, raising interest rates, which will then spark up inflation.  Mr. Schiff also goes on to say that: The US Fed has inflated the mother of all bubbles.

In short, we are hearing the same thing in general now in April 2015: Not enough Liquidity, Not enough Collateral.  Where did all that QE money go?  Stay tuned as the rest of this year could be a very rough ride indeed if these economic commentators are correct.",finance,1429568248

Excuse the wall of text,grammar,and formatting..i'm not good with those things.

I am currently trying to setup myself to purchase a home around february of next year and have just gotten a start on saving. 

I am currently saving about 1000-1500 a month so being realistic about things that happen throughout the year I'm saying i should at minimum have have 15k Cash. 

I am currently make 110k+ single file, no state tax, a year, yes i know that doesn't add up to the savings and i should have more but lets just say I will probably have a little more saved that I am not calculating

I currently pay about 1600 in rent a month and I live in an area/state with high property tax.

I am thinking about a house between between 200k and 250k or in monthly payment MAX of 1900 a month for that perfect house but really i'd like to stick around the 1500-1700. Property tax on these homes can range from 4k to 6k......Texas

I know if we are saying 15k thats obviously not enough for a down payment. I have a TIAA/CREF retirement account from a previous job that has roughly 23k in it. I believe I am not able to withdraw all of that at once so I am trying to figure out would this even be a good option. 

I know withdrawing from 401k's is onot the way to go but I am maxing my currently putting 11% of my current salary into my current 401k with matching and hope to max that out once a home is purchased and i have a firmer grasp on what is being spent monthly being a home owner. 

I only have a car loan on my credit and thats down to about 30% left and my FICO is is the 800s

Cost for apartments seem to only being up in general..just 2 years ago i was paying 1050 for the same amount of space and same area.

My question is how much could i remove from TIAA/CREF or is there a better solution. I want to get out of an apartment while the mortage rates are still decent and I know at some point ...me staying in an apartment longer to save won't actually be helping with the end cost of a house of interest rates keep climbing.

personalfinance,24F Agreed to pay for PLUS loans parents got for me for college. Any way to make it more bearable?,"I graduated from a large college in May of 2014. My parents took out loans for me as my ability to take out my own loans would not cover the cost of my education. It took me 5 years to graduate with my bachelors, and I have about $32,000 of my own debt in my name which I do not have to pay back yet because I don't make enough money per the income-based repayment plan for loans outside of $40 per month Perkins loan repayment. 

The PLUS loans my parents signed for me (about $40,000 by the time I graduated) I hoped I could transfer to myself after graduating and wait until I become more stable to start paying back, but I was stupid for not doing my research and that is not possible. My parents are 69 years old, and I do not understand their financial situation completely, though my mom works full-time as a thrift store manager and my dad works as part-time repairs. Their loan repayments are $600 per month which I pay as I agreed to do. I only make about $1,100 net a month (after insurance through work is paid, ect) right now so it is pretty crippling. I admit, I don't have a nice job, though I will teach English abroad starting in August and will make what equates to $28,000 per year. My Dad called the fedloan representatives see if the loan payments can be reduced and was told it was not possible. 

My question is, do I have any options to make the loan payments lower? Also, on a side note, if I choose to pursue a later higher degree (or medical-based associates degree,) will my parents payments pause so I can attend school once more or will I have to pay off loans with more loans? I am unsure what is necessary to include and what is unnecessary. If I can provide more information, please let me know. Thank you.

About me:  26yo male.  Graduated college 2 years ago with ~$36k in student loan debt.  Found a good job, but wasn't making any real dents on my net worth for the first year. 

I've been using Personal Capital for about 2 years and didn't really focus on saving or getting my net worth up.  After subscribing and reading here, I put forward an effort to a 3-part effort to become net positive from a personal worth side:

Part A: Increase Savings

1. Increase my retirement contributions and switch to standard 401 (K) from Roth
2. Any ""unclaimed"" funds got swept to my brokerage accounts to be invested.  These went towards common stocks and ETFs. This would leave me with a ~$500 balance in my checking.
3. Auto deposit $50/week to my savings account for my rainy day fund
4. Consolidate student loans with SoFi to a 10 year plan; giving me a lower interest rate (from 7% avg to 5.25%), a fixed cost per month, and the cash flow boost so that I could put money away in other areas.   

Part B: Reduce Expenses

1. Eat out less or eat less takeout
2. Eat more canned fruits and veggies as sides instead of fresh
3. Drink less beer, switch to vodka/rum/etc at home.  I found I'll drink more water doing this too!  If going out, bring these to the pregame and make every other drink at the bar a coke.
4. Maximize my company per diem on food.  I up to get $15/day for lunch. I used to get a $7 lunch and would still cook for dinner.  I now get a $12-$15 lunch and have leftovers
5. The biggest help with this was in Part A; having less money in checking and ready to spend made me more hesitant to spend.

Part C: Investing

1. Develop a strategy and stick with it.  Retirement accounts are  mostly in ETFS.  Brokerage accounts vary between cash and buying on days where everyone is pulling out (bought Friday and sold today, brought me $500 pre-tax)
2. Learn more about investing and don't be afraid to make some mistakes.  If you look at the chart, there were some big... horrible loss days.  If I had stopped then, I would have made those losses real. 

TL;DR Living like I'm paycheck to paycheck despite not having to made me more aware of my money and forced me to make a decision on how to spend every dollar.

personalfinance,Buying a House with my Girlfriend,"Hi Reddit

In the past couple of weeks I feel like I've made some big decisions without a huge amount of consultation. Before I go any further, i would like some advice.

Our Situation
I moved to BC, Canada almost 2 years ago for my ""dream job"". My girlfriend of 3 years has also found good work here, and we have decided we would like to settle here indefinitely. My parents are giving me a a large sume of money (mid 6 figures) to put towards a house, whenever I would like to buy one. We have been looking for a month, and last week made an offer on a house for 300k, which was accepted. We now have a couple of weeks to get the inspection done, get approved for a mortgage, and sort out all our paperwork so we can continue with the purchase.

I have enough money to buy the house outright, but because interest rates are low we are looking to pay a 50% deposit, and apply for a mortgage together for the remaining 50%. We want to protect this investment of my parents money, but also my girlfriends contribution to paying off the mortgage. We have agreed we will both sign a contract detailing what happens in the event that we break up, and that we will split the value of the house as follows:

Take the value of the house, either from selling it or by getting it independently appraised
Subtract the outstanding balance on the mortgage
Subtract the $150000 deposit
Split the rest equally, or use this is the 'buyout' value that I will pay her. In the event there is no remainder, nobody owes anything.

Does this seem like a fair agreement? If not, could you explain who it benefits, and suggest a better way?

I am unclear on what interest rate I should be aiming for - I assume that having such a large deposit makes me less of a risk, and so I should get a good rate. 

We are looking at taking a 5 year fixed rate mortgage with a 25 year amortization, which seems to strike a good balance between rate and commitment length. Does that sound like sensible thinking?

On ratehub I have seen rates as low as 2.49$, but with names I didn't recognise. The lowest rate for a Bank I have heard of is 2.74% with TD. Is 2.49 a realistic rate to aim for?

Finally, I am unclear on how to get the best rate. We have spoken with a loan officer today and have 2 appointments with banks this week - assuming we are happy with the prepayment priveleges, should we just be looking for the lowest rate, or are there other things to consider?

I realize that the wiki says to contribute to your 401k first, and I plan on contributing something to it, however my employer matches 25% of my contributions up to 50% of my salary.  Unfortunately contributing half of my paycheck isn't financially viable for me.  I want to put as much as I can into the high interest loans first, but I'm not sure how much to contribute to my 401k.

Here's some numbers that may help:

Student loan balances and interest rates:

6.55% - $6,543.17

4.53% - $3,889.5

4.525 - $12,144.35

4.25% - $3,119.28

3.00% - $3,994.67

3.00% - $6,663.28

3.00% - $6,170.73

2.875 - $3,158.96

2.50% - $3,622.69

Total: $54,712.19

Monthly income less fixed costs:
$1,859.74

I define fixed costs as loan payments, rent, utilites, gas, food, and car insurance payments.  For budgeting purposes I'm assuming that I'll spend half of the remaining income ($929.87) each month on expenses like car repairs, entertainment, minor emergencies, etc.  I try to live frugally, so in reality the monthly ""variable expenses"" should be much less than anticipated and can be pumped into my student loans.

One thing I should note is that I have struggled financially after graduating college due to almost a year of unemployment where the great state of California screwed me out of collecting unemployment.  I was forced to move back in with my parents, work two minimum wage jobs unrelated to my field just to pay my loans, and take the first mediocre paying job in my field simply due to a lack of those jobs in my hometown.

Only within the last year was I able to find a decent paying job in my field that has allowed me to stop living paycheck to paycheck.  The thought of still owing so much money scares me and I feel like a slave to the debt.  I realize that on paper optimizing my 401k contributions will be financially optimal in the long run.  However even with a $10k emergency fund that's only 6 months of living expenses, and the massive amount of debt I have feels like a soul crushing pressure.

TL;DR - How should I split $929.87 per month between paying off high interest loans and contributing to a 401k?",finance,1429584933
Bitcoin,"Been accepting Bitcoin at my company since October 2013, today I sold my first item for Bitcoin!!!","Don't want to get to deep in the details but I always said that Before Bitcoin can make a big move up there has to be an opportunity not just to buy it,  but to earn it. 

This is phase 2 for me, and I'll earn all I can. 

Phase 3 hits 10,000 upon mass adoption and failure by the FeD to address the problems with the dollar. 

I hope I can hurry and earn more before the price goes up. 

Today I earned many dollars, but that doesn't matter,  today I earned just over 2  bitcoins!!!! And I'm keeping all of them. 

(Thanks Coinbase for making it so easy to receive payment,  my customer was amazed at how easy it was to buy bitcoins and pay me on my payment page,  as always, classy.) 

And yes,  it's a taxable event and I'll pay my taxes on any gains happily.  I'm not trying to avoid taxes, I just want to progress toward honest money.  I use Coinbase and am wide open to the government checking my books.   Go ahead,  honest money and stopping the theft of inflation is way more important of a step than tax avoidance.  

I'm not anti government, or even anti tax, but I am anti private control and issuance of public money. 

Bring on taxes,  I'll pay my share, I just want a level playing field.   If taxes became fair I doubt many could complain about them.  I hate unfair taxes and fees that are hidden and convoluted.   Give me a fair, level playing field and an honest currency that is a store of value and I'll give you the most prosperous decade in American history. 

My customer was amazed and loved the experience, and he bought a few days ago at 218, so he made a few bucks when he paid me at 225.   

This is real progress.  Once you can earn Bitcoin as easy as buy Bitcoin it has to go to 10,000.

personalfinance,"I feel sick to my stomach from crushing student loan debt through marriage totaling $158,000. I don't know what to do.","Long story short: 

I got married about six months ago to the love of my life. I was aware of her financial situation with student loans before we got married.  I couldn't not marry someone who I am in love with because of money.  I would never forgive myself.  We are both in our mid twenties...I've browsed this site a few times but haven't seen anyone with a higher student loan balance than what she - well, WE do now. I feel my situation is bleak.  I don't know if I'll get any sound advice here or not.  Either way, writing this out helps my sanity and hopefully I can come away feeling some kind of encouragement.

So here is the situation:

12 Federal Student loans - all Stafford Sub.

Group 1 Total - $23,572 @ 6.8% Int.
Group 2 Total - $3,196 @ 5.6% Int.
Group 3 Total - $32,741 @ 6.8% Int.

8 Private Student loans Sallie Mae

Group 1 Total - $12,067 @ 4.75% Int.
Group 2 Total - $77,863 @ 1.75% Int.
Group 3 Total - $8,622 @ 1.62% Int.
Total ~ $98,500

My annual salary is 50K and hers is client based, ranging from 30K-40K.  We have no other debt, and we rent a very small apartment. I do not wish to put my entire budget on here, but we are able to pay $1200 a month on the Federal student loans.  Her parents are helping us at the moment by paying just the interest payments every month on the private Sallie Mae loans. But they say that can not do that much longer.  

Does anyone have any idea on what I can do?  I thought about bankruptcy but it seems next to impossible to discharge student loans.  I do not understand loan consolidation and am not sure if it will help the situation.  Other ideas included investing in a house that we could sell later for profit and use that money to pay down the loans. What about deferring some of the Subsidized loans so interest does not accrue? 

Part of the reason I am writing this is because I feel trapped. While grateful for my job, I cannot stand it and know I cant do it long term. My dream job that I want to apply for would require us to relocate to a remote place and I would take a pay cut to about 38K and she would lose her job, obviously.

May be the same question but also, I'm seeing lenders offer 2 years fixed 1.95% initial rate then 4.55 consequential, does that mean I can take advantage of this great rate for 2 years then move to another low deal after two years before I hit the higher rate?

Lastly, the more I pay, will that drop my monthly payments? As I slowly pay back a 25 years mortgage does the interest on the final lump sum drop and my monthly amounts go down or have I got that wrong?

personalfinance,I think I'm going to file chapter 13 bankruptcy. Any advice before I dive off the cliff? [xpost from r/legaladvice],"Hello there!

I posted here yesterday about a car lease that I have to pay looking for advice on what to do. Well, I heard from the finance company today! And it was terrible. Shit, what a difference a day makes. 

I'm IBBroke from the California Bay Area, and I have a debt problem. It is long and convoluted, but please hear me out. Every day I contemplate driving off the Bay Bridge on the way to work and just ending this shit, so any advice prior to that would be much appreciated.

Here's where my life is so far...

.

Income wise every month I get down like so:

-I gross between $7000 and $7500 per month. Or $3500 to $4000 per bi-weekly paycheck.

-I net around $4000 to $4500 per month. Or $2000 to $2500 per bi-weekly paycheck.

-California likes taxes, so as you noticed my income gets ravaged by that. I also work for the University of California, so I have to pay a mandatory 10.5% pre-tax deduction to my pension. I am also in a domestic partnership, so my health, dental, legal, and vision benefits are all taxed.

-I claim Single 1 exemption federally and Married 1 exemption state.

.

My outstanding debt is as follows:

Student Loans: $40,000

Car Loan: $15,500 (the car's KBB value is roughly $9,000)

Leased Car that I stupidly returned and now owe the remaining balance: $13,000

Credit Card #1: $8,000

Credit Card #2: $4,500

Credit Card #3: $1,800

Credit Card #4: $1,400

Credit Card #5: $1,100

Credit Card #6: $500

Unsecured debts = $61,500. Secured car loan = $15,500. Total = $78,000.

.

My monthly expenses are as follows:

Rent (one bedroom): 1,395

Car loan: 280

Credit card #1: 170

Credit card #2: 80

Credit Card #3: 60

Credit Card #4: 50

Credit Card #5: 55

Credit Card #6: 50

Credit Card #7: (of which I am an authorized user, and pay the balance for my medically unemployed mother): 250

Car insurance (for my + partners car): 135

Student Loans: 450

FastTrack (aka bridge tolls): 200 a month

Utilities (water, garbage, gas, sewer, electricity): 200

Cell phones: 145

Internet: 50

Grand Total: $3,570 per month.

.

So why bankruptcy you ask? Because when I was a stupid ass college student I dug myself into a fucking debt crater. I'm wasn't ""drowning"", but my head is just barely above water.

My income leaves me with $500 to $800 per month of discretionary spending. That goes towards groceries and gas for both me and my partner. We spend $400 a month on groceries, and $250-300 a month on gas as we both commute roughly 100 miles a day. That leaves negative to 100 left for anything else that might come up, and of course, something always comes up. Sick pet, new tires for car, oil changes, whatever.

I have no savings account and nothing extra in my checking account. I have no retirement accounts either. All my credit cards have been closed and set up on fixed payment plans, so I have no credit for emergencies either. There is the pension that I mentioned, but it can not be touched or modified for any reason until I retire or quit.
Basically, one big emergency and we have zero reserves. We walk a razor thin line.

We never eat out, or go on vacations, or to the movies, or anything really that isn't free. I work at the highest paying hospital in the country, so getting another job/moving isn't an option. I also have a very specific specialty so finding a side job in what I do also isn't an option (because there are none). I also have absurdly demanding hours (and need to be able to be contacted basically 24 hours a day) both on and off the medical campus. He is in medical school, and there is no such thing as working and going to med school unless you love doing cocaine. We commute 100 miles round trip because we live 50 miles away where rent is the cheapest. Anything closer to work and rents explode. We have the cheapest internet we can manage for my work. Phone bill is too expensive, but to terminate would be $800 we don't have. Can't sell the car and get a beater because the loan is more than the value of the car. He has no savings or other income either. Both our families have no money to help us.

I look at the expense list every day and try to find wiggle room but there's none left. Hence the reason I longingly look off the bridge every day.

I posted last night in personal finance about my car lease, but the game changed today. The finance company wants payment in full, all $13,000. The payment plan offer is $635 per month. Non-negotiable. If I can't pay, they will sue for the balance. End of story.

I obviously don't have that money and I sure as shit don't have any way to raise it either. If they sue me and garnish 25%, well then we're fucked. At that point credit cards won't get paid, so more garnishments. Which means student loans won't get paid, so more garnishments. And well, you can see where this is going.
So finally, the question(s)!

How would a chapter 13 bankruptcy work for me? I make a lot of money, what is the court going to think about that? How will my discretionary income be calculated? Will my other required bills (like rent, utilites, care payments, etc) be factored in? I need at least $700 a month just for food and gas, will the court care? Since my partner can't work and I provide full support, will that matter in estimating my discretionary income? Can I present a case to the court showing the wage garnishment death-spiral and why I need bankruptcy to save me from that?

About 4 years ago my girlfriend had a medical emergency that racked up $50,000 in medical bills. She's been living at home ever since and working but the medical bills are still huge. She is considering filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy through the local Legal Aid office because she is low income and qualifies for their services.

She also has a car loan that is currently financed at 9% interest. The car was financed through the car dealership so I think it may be possible to get a lower rate elsewhere in spite of her low credit score. The car loan was co-signed by her parents so she does not want to discharge it in bankruptcy as it would leave her parents liable for the debt since they co-signed it. 

I would like to try and get a lower interest rate if possible but am unsure how the upcoming bankruptcy will change that. Would it be better to attempt the refinance now, after the bankruptcy or just to try and pay the car off as quickly as possible at the current interest rate? Perhaps there is another way that I do not know about?

Then he said we could talk about Roth IRA and brokerage accounts.  I wanted a second opinion because $300+ a month for life insurance I don't need sounded like money that could be better invested elsewhere.  I spoke with a CFP from the Garrett Planning Network, but the fees for advice seemed astronomical.  My mom put me in touch with the company that's partnered with her employer, Midland National, and while they recommended against the disability and long-term care, they are actually trying to sell me on TWO life insurance policies - a flexible premium adjustable life with indexed features and an indexed universal life.

Bitcoin,How Soros goes all in,"In the more than six years since the global financial crisis, there have been a large number of excellent speculative opportunities. Gold tripled, crude oil fell 80%, the Australian dollar fell 2000 points, and Bitcoin increased ten thousand-fold. So with all these investment opportunities, why not go all in? In 1992 George Soros went all in and broke the Bank of England. 

&amp;nbsp;

The way Soros makes an all in bet is different than ordinary investors. He will wait for a key moment that has a high probability of being a reversal point, then he will go all in. Ordinary investors often make many bets that each have a 50% chance to win - but 50% * 50% * 50% * 50% means that an investor than makes several all in bets will lose eventually.

&amp;nbsp;

**Go all in before the market reverses**

&amp;nbsp;

In 2012\, George Soros shorted the Japanese yen and profited one billion dollars.

&amp;nbsp;

In 2013\, Soros moved to the Australian dollar market. The Australian central bank cut interest rates for the first time. When the AUD was at the highest point (1.06), Soros took a one billion dollar short position, and the AUD subsequently declined.

&amp;nbsp;

**Go all in and catch the reversal point**
At the end of 2013\, the China A-share market was coming to the reversal point after a long decline; after several rounds of volatility, finally there was a breakthrough: 

&amp;nbsp;

**Where is the next opportunity to go all in?**
Which market will have the next opportunity to go all in? U.S. stocks, A-shares, gold, and crude oil seem to lack of clear direction. But the monthly Bitcoin chart shows a very clear long downward trend:

On Huobi's USD trading platform BitYes.com you can borrow funds to do 3:1 margin trading for a low interest rate of only 0.01% per day. If you want more leverage, check out Huobi's Bitcoin futures trading platform BitVC.com, where you can trade with up to 20:1 leverage.

personalfinance,Advice getting approved for a student loan with a default?,"Hi everyone. I'm utterly lost and scared shitless.

To start off:

When I was 18, I left an abusive home to go to college in another state. I was told that I could get financial aid if I could submit my fafsa - but after multiple attempts I couldn't get it to go through because my father was blocking me in one way or another. I wasn't aware at the time that I could apply as an independent. In short, I accrued $18,000 in debt from that college which went into collection.

I then returned to my hometown and I've since been attending another institution and received federal student aid - but I took dual-credit classes in high school which didn't contribute to my degree, but ended up counting against my federal credit hours cap so I was denied further federal aid and my appeal wasn't accepted.

Now I'm in my last stretch of my career. I'm in 2 classes right now and I will take 2 classes over the summer and then I'll be able to graduate. But I need to get a loan to pay for this semester and the next and I can't seem to get approved because of the default. 

My plan thus far was to finish college and then start paying off that 18k. There's no way I could pay that loan right now and still afford my living expenses.

It's been 5 years since the date of the default and I don't know if I should somehow get a loan and let that default reach its 7 year limit (because I don't think it counts as a student loan...) or if I should try to go through a debt repayment agency to get that 18k out of default. 

**tl;dr**: Made some bad, poorly-informed decisions when I was 18. Got an 18k default. Not eligible for federal aid. I'm set to graduate in July, but not if I can't get a student loan.

**Edit**: I'm trying to get a $3500 loan and it will likely be the same for the summer semester. I do have a cosigner with good credit, but I was still denied by custudentloans.

**Edit2**: Here's a probably dumb question: Should I try to get a [credit card](http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/nerdwallets-best-low-interest-credit-cards/) to put this debt on?",finance,1429624760

personalfinance,Retirement portfolio - did I do it right?,"Hi all,

&amp;nbsp;

I've been lurking on /r/personalfinance for a while and learned a lot from you all, so thank you for generously sharing your time. Like many of you, I come from a background where I was never exposed to these types of conversations, so it has been invaluable. 

&amp;nbsp;

I write to you today because for the first time I am making my own investment decisions for my retirement portfolio, and I hoped that as my teachers you could help review my thinking. Thank you in advance!

&amp;nbsp;

General savings strategy:  
(1)	Emergency fund established   
(2)	High interest loans paid off  
(3)	Maxed IRA contribution  
(4)	Now contributing to employer 403(b) (no matching, so for pre-tax benefit)  
I have funds in both Roth and Traditional IRAs because I’m unsure about my future tax bracket (although I currently have no state income tax, and am unmarried), and despite all I’ve read on it, it never seemed clear to me that one was better than the other (for me). Does it make sense to have both accounts?

&amp;nbsp;

Portfolio strategy – “an aggressive strategy targeting 2055 retirement”  
Total portfolio value right now is around $25k.

&amp;nbsp;

(3) IRA with TIAA-CREF:   
60% US   
30% International   
10% Real Estate – Is it an appropriate risk substitute to use physical Real Estate (not REIT) in place of Bonds?   

&amp;nbsp;

Specifically, these index funds:   
40% TIQRX (US / large blend)  
10% TRGMX (US / mid growth)*  
10% TRBIX (US / small blend)  
20% TRIEX (foreign / large blend)  
10% TEQSX (diversified emerging / large blend)  
10% QREARX (physical real estate)  
*All are index funds with ER &lt; 0.5, with the exception of mid cap for which there was no index, and the physical real estate option unique to TIAA-CREF. I’m unsure if I really need to have mid and small in the mix as a part of an aggressive strategy?    
Rejected options included the non-index version of the above: TRLCX, TRVRX, TRSEX, TRERX, TEMSX, and real estate securities TRRSX, and Nuveen Dividend Value fund FAQIX. 

&amp;nbsp;

I made this blend based off of TIAA’s automated suggestion for a highly aggressive portfolio, but simplified it by including only index funds with low ER. I also looked at their 2055 Target Fund holdings, which is very similar but excluded small cap/mid cap/real estate. It took a lot of research to compile this – in your opinion is it worth it to make my own portfolio each year, versus selecting a simple Target Fund? (To get reduce the overall ER from 0.71 to 0.42 and include options like mid, small, physical real estate?) 

&amp;nbsp;

Should I eventually transfer my TIAA-CREF accounts to Vanguard? Everyone here (and on Morningstar, and Lazy Portfolio-ists) seems to love Vanguard, but is there really a big difference as long as I choose the low-ER index fund options with TIAA-CREF?

&amp;nbsp;

(4) 403b with Frost – No employer matching – so should I still put in as much as possible (up to the $18,000 limit), as opposed to other investment vehicles? I already have sufficient emergency savings (6mo+), have paid off most my loans (any that remain are less than 2.5% interest), and have maxed my IRA contribution. I can also contribute to the 403(b) as Roth instead of pre-tax, but wasn’t sure why I would want to do that?

&amp;nbsp;

Portfolio strategy: - I tried to keep both my IRA and 403b balanced on their own; so that my whole portfolio would be balanced. But TIAA-CREF and Frost have strengths in some funds vs. others, so I’m open to a more complex mix?  
60% US   
30% International   
10% Bonds   

&amp;nbsp;

Specifically:  
60% Vanguard VFIAX  (US / large blend / S&amp;P 500 index) – the total market is not an option; only S&amp;P 500.  
30% Dodge&amp;Cox DODFX (foreign / large blend)   
10% Frost FATRX (short term bonds) – This has a 2.5% load/sales charge. Is it still worth it?   
*I only have a handful of options through work, and most have loads/max sales charge of 5.5% so I avoided them.   
Rejected options include: Invesco small VSCAX and mid VGRAX; Perkins mid JDPR; Thrivent small AASMX mid AASCX and large AAAGX; American Beacon large AAGPX; American Century target 2045 AROAX; and Federated Prime PRSXX.

We are aiming to spend 20-23k on a new or like new vehicle. Our CU would offer a 2.66 interest rate in our situation. This price range should have our payments at around 375. This price should be comfortable with our current finance situation. We would have to eat out a little less often (NBD.)

https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-C6FH27J9/

Observations:  
1. Many here at Investing are relative newcomers to the field. Certainly, a site such as Reddit can provide newcomers with unique perspectives in the securities market. 

2. Many of the considered speculative stocks are indeed trendy, such as Apple, Ali Baba, even Bitcoin.  

3. Interestingly, Apple was considered the riskiest - and safest - stock by some in the survey.  This would probably be a good future question to ask in June the Q2 survey. 

4. Researching on securities to most is a part-time activity. This makes sense, seeing as how a lot of people work and have social lives, and thus have little time to research. 

5. For the most part, returns collectively are positive

6. People hate hidden fees, interest rates, Brokerage firms that do not offer low-cost index funds. People love index funds, low fees, historical data. 

7. Reddit is split between a preference towards value and growth stocks.

8. Optimism is afoot here, although it is unknown where the market will be five years from now.  

9. Reddit is divided when it comes to allocation of net worth towards investments.  

10. Reddit also is divided on whether or not one can effectively beat the market in returns.

I just finished school, an I'm moving back to my home city to start a new job. I'm trying to find an apartment that's close to work to avoid the nightmarish parking situation downtown, which means that my rent is probably going to be around the 1200-1400 mark. I've been happily looking at apartments in this range for the past week or two, and I have a few that I am really interested in. I thought that this amount for rent was totally doable as I don't really have many other expenses or loans - car insurance, phone bill, internet bill, food and some other monthly spending - and my salary is pretty good, 62,000 a year or 5200 a month before tax. 

I told someone about my quest for an apartment, and they scoffed at me for my naivety, thinking that I could afford 2000-ish a month in expenses and not be totally broke on my salary. So I'm a little concerned.

financialindependence,M/25 - Real Estate Advice (LA),"Hey r/financialindependence,


I’ve been pondering the idea of buying an investment property with interest rates being as low as they are now. A friend of mine who’s in real estate (does loans), has recommended that it’s a good idea to start investing in real estate since I’m young and my expenses are low. The plan is to buy a house out east (about 30 miles from Downtown) where real estate is more affordable. A decent place goes for about 300k-350k. I did some quick research, rent in that area is about 1700-1800 per month. Mortgage on a loan that size at 4.5% is about 1600. Worst case scenario, I pay 1600 for a few months until I get it rented out. Once that happens I can either break even or profit about 150-200 dollars.


Question is: In my current position, what would be the best route to take. I want to accelerate my gains as quickly as possible. Is it a good idea to get a starter investment property or go the traditional route and max my 401k and then invest in other opportunities? Long term optimistic goal is to have multiple rental properties that can generate a steady stream of income and potentially sell them for a decent profit years later. I want to know what’s the wisest thing I should do with my extra money.

 - I used a non-IRS calculator and arrived at a number $1,000 less than what the IRS calculator suggested. However, this calculator was asking about ""personal exemptions"", and I'm not 100% sure what those mean (even after Googling), so I just put in 1.

personalfinance,Opinions wanted on grad school financial planning for a guy with a family,"Help me with this financial logistics problem regarding IRA liquidation versus student loan acquisition.  Let me know if you have more questions about my situation or need more details.

I am a married homeowner with one nearly two-year old child.  My wife works full time. I am beginning a PhD program this fall that will take me until spring 2018 to complete. To do this, I am leaving my full-time job. The PhD program will cover tuition and fees, and pay me a stipend.  The stipend will amount to a $15,000 reduction in my current income.

My wife and will I have to continue to pay for our current lifestyle with $15,000 less in income. We already live pretty frugally, and have no debt other than our mortgage payment. Because we live in an expensive area, don’t make a lot of money, and have a child, our expenses (including 10% saving for future) are pretty much equal to our current income. We could probably cut our expenses by $1-2k annually by being spendthrifts, but not more than that.

 
The problem: what’s the most logical way to acquire that $15,000 in annual income back? Getting another job is unrealistic because the PhD is a full-time commitment. My wife and I currently have $20,000 sitting in IRA’s.  Does it make sense to liquidate those IRAs, take the 10% penalty (and pay income tax on them) before I take out an equivalent $16,000 in student loans? I’m leaning towards liquidating the IRAs for several reasons:

1) No one can beat the market, but we’re probably currently approaching a market peak given the trajectory since the 2009 market bottom. Stated otherwise, I’m not sure if my IRA return will beat the 6.8% interest rate on loans I’ll be facing over the next 12 years or so.

2) If I take out more loans now, I’ll be paying more in loan payments in the future, which will leave me less able to save for retirement then.

3) I will probably be able to save for retirement rapidly and regain the lost IRA $20k (plus returns) within 5-7 years after finishing my PhD.

Disclaimer: paying off $25,000-$45,000 in student loans will not be challenging with my post PhD income. Completing the PhD is without a doubt my best career option in terms of future income, work life balance, etc.",finance,1429639478
personalfinance,Looking for feedback on my financial plan.,"Hi all,

I've been reading up on personal finance with a couple different books and of course the sidebar and want to make sure that I'm interpreting the advice for my own situation correctly. I have no background or history in the realm of personal finance so I'm trying to educate myself and this post is to get some feedback to hopefully see if I am on the right track. Any opinions or criticisms however harsh are welcome! First some background. 

Me (M25), 47k/year with a target of additional 12500/year in commission. Wife (F26), 48k/year. Our combined take home is 5,005/month prior to commissions. I have about 10k in a 401k and Roth IRA and contributing 10%, she is about 15k in her 401k contributing 12% and 2k in her Roth IRA. We have 465000 in student loan debt, (6500 mine, the rest hers) although 17,500 will be forgiven of federal debt through my wife's job as of August 2016. We have a car payment of 201.25 on a 2011 Camry with 38k miles that will last us at least 10 years. A mortgage on a house with a payment of 780, which I'm currently paying 1,000/month on. About 1k in savings because we have been aggressively paying debt (already got all credit cards and a few small student loans). I also have a card that I use only for expenses through work so it is paid in full every month. 

Here is my plan:
First pay off debts from smallest to largest (my student loan, car, her student loan) using the additional income of commission which can range from 0-3k/month. Excepting her last large loan of around 20k which will I will pay double the minimum and chip down over the years. 

Once debts are paid I will put together an emergency fund of 6 months. I would do this prior to debt payoff, but if worst comes to worst, I know our families would help us. 

Then begin saving for a downpayment on a house. Our dream house is about 300k now (low cost of living where we are at) so I'll put away 60k for a down payment, although of course that may change by the time we get to that point. While saving for a down payment I want to max out contributions to all of our retirement accounts while saving. 

Does this all sound like a solid plan? I know this is probably very basic for you all on here, but I really have no clue what I'm doing and just taking cues from what I've read (and will continue to read to educate myself). What kind of financial shape would you say we are in? Good, bad, screwed, whatever it is just lets me know what we need to work on next.

personalfinance,Is money placed in a retirement account taxed twice?,"I'm having a difficult time coming up with the wording to explain what I mean, but here's my attempt:

So say I make $1 pre-tax from a job, and let's say hypothetically that that $1 is taxed at 30% for federal taxes. 

So, that $1 is now $0.70, and let's say I'm interested in placing that $0.70 in a Roth IRA. To my understanding, with a Roth IRA you pay taxes at a rate that is determined by your income, and you pay this tax in the present so that when you take that money out when you're ~70 years old you don't pay any tax on it. 

Now here's my confusion:

1) Is the amount paid on federal taxes the same as ""income taxes""? I know it's a dumb question but I could use a quick explanation if possible.

2) My inclination is that these two rates are different, so let's say that my income puts me in a bracket where I pay 15%. Now, back to the $1 that became $0.70 from federal taxes. When I place the $0.70 in a Roth IRA is that then taxed at 15%? So now I would have that $0.70 going toward some form of equity accumulating interest, but when tax season rolls around I owe 15% of the $0.70 (which is around $0.10). This brings me to my question: is money placed in a retirement account taxed twice?

i.e. $1 - $0.3 - $0.1 = $0.60.

Would it be a dumb move for my future to take most of my 403b out, apply it towards the higher interest private loans, and start contributing to the 403b again?

personalfinance,"(CAN) I've got a large sum of money in mutual funds meant for downpayment on a house - is now a good time, or wait? What other options do I have?","I'm 29 years old, and work as a graphic designer - I make a low salary ~$1830 a month at a start up owned by some friends. I've been here 4 years. my starting salary was even more embarassingly low.I'm reaching that 'more than 5 years experience' mark where I feel like I could branch out a bit or move onto better opportunities, but I'm pretty comfortable at this office for now. Its on my radar though. I've got a fiancee who is 23 and is going to school in the fall of 2016 to become an LPN - she is taking this year off to work. She's working retail and will probably make anywhere between $800-$1200 a month depending on hours. 

I've got a car thats 1 year from being paid off but currently is $270 a month. That'll be gone the same fall my fiancee starts school. 

Other than that we've got some small credit card debts - only about $2000 between us - other than this, my car and her student loans we will have no other debts. 

We currently pay almost $1100 a month in rent and utilities. On top of everything else we have to pay for in the course of a month, not hard to see how things are tight and stressful. We are paying too much in rent and the lower priced options are frankly dumps around these parts.

My parents gifted my brothers and I money into mutual funds when we were kids that they have allowed to grow and are approximately worth $84,000 today, and have grown steadly with minimal additional investing from myself. This money has always been intended for us each to use this for a downpayment on a house. They have both done this to buy condos out in Calgary. I'm on the east coast where 84k goes a lot further.

What I've been toying with the idea of is looking at houses in the 120-150k range with a 50-60k downpayment so as to not completely blow that investment away. On top of the 84k, my father has offered an early payout of some of my inheritance to help even further with the downpayment - this will be about 30k on top of the 84k already invested. So it would be 50-60k of approximately 115k, leaving us with still around 65k saved in the investments.

In our area houses in this range would have about $1700 in property tax (141 per month). All calculations I've done based on the average interest rates I'm seeing puts me at about $300-450 per month in mortgage payments. The cost of utilities are harder to predict but I still feel like with this big of a downpayment + low monthly payments I'd be coming out ahead if I bought. I've done the calculator from the NYTimes and it sounds like I'm making the right decision.

I've gotten some friction from my brothers and my mom about buying - they've made it perfectly clear they think its a really bad idea actually. It's hard enough to make big decisions like this without feeling like your family isn't in your corner. My dad has been pushing us to buy something for years and he has moved and owned many properties over the years - so its not that big of a deal to him. 

Basically I'm just scared of screwing up the only chance I have to use this downpayment to start my life. I feel sick looking at how much of my money goes to basically nothing - I know the benefits and drawbacks of both owning and renting and that I'm risking much less by renting. But I feel like I'm ready for the risk and the work. 

Something I didn't really mention is my fiancees role in this. I'm assuming that she wont be able to be counted as income and the house will basically be in my name. She doesnt make very much and works very inconsistently - especially during the school year. In my mind I have to go into this assuming there'd be stretches where the burden is all on me. 

So have at it. Our lease is up September so we need to make a change of some sort by then. I can answer any questions or will just take my beating if its a horrible idea.",finance,1429647056

personalfinance,I want to buy a home. Will need to ask my Father for help. Wanting to have all bases covered. Asking makes me nervous for some reason.,"I turned 30 in December and with that age came access to a trust fund that was setup for me.  It's roughly 75k.

I've been renting with a roommate for the past 5 years.  Two different places, one was 1200 a month, and then we moved 2 years ago and this one is 1000 a month.  We are musicians and wanted to have some space for our gear and a place to play it so we didn't have to rent a separate rehearsal space hourly, so we have opted for rental houses which is why the more expensive price tag instead of just being in apartments.  But in the end it's worth it, because a single apartment is going to be 500 minimum for a decent spot, so we always figured we might as well throw our resources together.  Plus we are both single and not very conventional.  I'm not rushing to get married or have children or anything.  

But with that said, I have also been in college, and will be graduating at the end of summer with my Bachelor's of Science.  I'm graduating at 30 because I spent the first half of my twenties as a touring musician and doing that whole thing, if anyone is wondering why I'm so late at college.

So anyway, I live in a pretty low cost of living city.  Our current lease is up and our landlord has hinted more than once that they would like to move back to this area (they are currently out of state), so at any time, we could get a 30 day notice to have to move.  I hate moving so much.  The thought of getting notice to have to leave this house and sign a new 1 year lease somewhere else just sounds terrible every way I look at it.

So I've been looking at some houses.  I found one I really like, and the seller is asking 115,000.  It is a lovely little house.  Basement, 2 car garage, decent yard, 5 year old roof, 4 year old HVAC.  They are an older couple just moving to a condo to be closer to their children.  They have taken immaculate care of this house.  They also said the price is negotiable, and it's tax assessment is only about 105k, but they've put a lot of upgrades into it not thinking they would have ever moved (their words).

Anyway, since I'm older than the average college student, I've been really trying to crack down on finishing school so my schedule has been crazy.  It has been difficult to have a steady job as I take night classes, day classes, mid-day classes, morning classes, all sorts of classes.  I drive for Uber some.  I have a truck so I do odd jobs moving furniture.  I'll do some catering some.  Play some music gigs.  I have a really low overhead as my car is paid off and reliable.  In all honesty, I can get by on 1200 a month, perhaps even less.  

So just for example, say they accepted an offer of 110,00 for the house.  I put 20% down from my trust, which is $22,000.  The zillow mortgage calculator says the 30 yr fixed payment would be 396 a month plus an estimated $67 in taxes and insurance fees....

That is currently less than my share of our rent now.  I could afford it on my own.  Also, the previous 12 months of utilities average just under 100 bucks for this particular house and the owner showed me the statements.  My utilities at my current rental house are 250-300 a month because the windows need replacing, the furnace and air conditioner are outdated and not energy efficient.  Landlords just don't seem to take too good of care of their rental homes, just the bare minimum, at least in my experience.  

So it just seems like the logical thing to do us buy a home.  I have no desire to leave this city.  This house would always be able to bring in between 900-1000 a month as a rental if I ever chose to get a bigger house or anything.

Problem is, I just don't have steady employment at the moment or make enough to qualify for a mortgage.  For some reason, I feel really nervous about asking my Dad for help.  It would essentially be completely risk free for him as far as I can tell.  I could get an insurance policy that would pay him if something happened to me so he could pay off the house and not have to worry about it.  I wouldn't feel comfortable asking if this was a house where the mortgage would be around 1000 a month, but this is cheap.  It's less than my current share of rent with a roommate.  If my roommate stuck with me, and I'm about 99% sure he would, then he would essentially be paying the entire cost of the mortgage if I chose to charge him that much, and 400-500 a month would be more than fair.  If he moved out, I could easily afford the mortgage on my own.  If I can't find a job when I graduate, I can wait tables and make enough money to pay for this.  

I've considering asking if the owner would be willing to do a lease with purchase option or owner financing so I can have a few years to be able to get the financing myself once I graduate and get a real job, but I know the lease with purchase option is kind of a waste of money, and they might not be willing to do an owner financing situation.  I just hate the idea of asking my Dad for help, even though he has helped me plenty of times in the past when I was serious in the music thing.  He co-signed on a car for me where the payment was 330 a month and I never missed a payment and was never late for 60 months.  The only reason he co-signed was because I could get a much better interest rate on the loan and I needed a fuel efficient vehicle for touring.

This might have just been one big wall text of rambling.  I just don't know why I feel so nervous about asking him for help.  Something about it being a home just makes it seem like a really big deal, which it is, but it would be one of the more responsible things I've done with a large amount of money, as opposed to traveling all over the country sleeping in parking lots as a touring musician.

Anyway, anyone have any advice?  My Dad is a smart guy, pretty conservative with money, is retired from a government job with nice pension but still makes 30-40k a year doing his hobbies which happen to bring in money.  To me, there isn't really any reason he can say no, other than just not wanting to help.  I could always play the card that the person that setup the trust fund for me is the same person who loaned him the money to buy the house he and my Mom first got.  (My Mom's Dad loaned them the money for their first home.)  My Mom is no longer alive, so I essentially inherited her inheritance from her Father.",finance,1429651999

When I bought my house ($169,000) instead of taking out a mortgage, I had my parents take a home equity loan in their house and transfer funds to me - this way I could bypass closing costs and have a lower interest rate = 2.5%. I put down the $69,000 and took the equity loan for $100,000. I've been paying towards it a lot in the past 6 months and owe $86,600 against it and have a monthly payment of ~$535 plus utilities and whatnot. I pay it like a mortgage and it comes right out of my bank account. 

So here's the issue: I'm currently having a patio put in for $6,700. I have enough to put $1,700 of my own in, and I need $5,000. I don't have that and I'm torn between my two options:

1.) My parents will loan me the money and I can make monthly payments to them with no interest for the $5,000 ($1,000 a month for 5 months).

Or

2.) Borrow against the home equity loan and go back to owing $91,000 but then pay $1,000 a month towards the home equity instead of the monthly minimum payment for 5-6 months. 

Would doing #2 lower my monthly payment? I don't like the sound of paying for a back patio for 20 years, but if it's cheaper to do that, then it's fine. 

I'm confused on what to do, I always deal in cash so paying it off in 6 months (#1) seems appealing.

I started receiving 28K 2 years ago, and immediately bought in on the Vanguard Index Fund Admiral Shares and a couple others after reading the r/pf wiki. Last year I bought a couple random Index Funds. I am just curious what I should do with this year's 28K? I know I need to invest in some bonds for safety from market volatility, but I have heard that the interest rate may be raised soon, so it's not best to buy bonds right now. At the same time, I don't want to be sitting on 28K in a savings account when it could be making money for me somewhere. Here are my current holdings:

* Vanguard Health Care Fund Investor Shares: ~19K
* Vanguard REIT Index Fund Investor Shares: ~4K
* Vanguard Selected Value Fund: ~15K

personalfinance,~$2000 auto loan?,"Hey all,


I (24, recent college grad) am currently targeting buying my parents' old car as a part of my march towards full financial independence. The car is a 2002 Honda Accord Coupe worth about $4.5k according to Kelly Blue Book. 


The reason I'm buying the car is because I was considering buying a new or more recent car for around $20-$25k, applied to be pre-approved for an auto loan and was basically told that since I hadn't had any comparable purchases I would get a pretty poor interest rate unless I had someone co-sign. 


As the whole purpose of this exercise is for me to become financially independent, I figured that wouldn't be ideal. My parents offered that I could buy the car that they never use and they would cut me a bit off the kbb price. I know the car well and like driving it and know it's in good condition so I know it's a good investment. 


Now, the crux of the problem: I can't find anywhere that will give me an auto loan small enough for the car after I put a down payment on it. I could afford to just write my parents a check and be on my merry way, but I would rather at least get something on my credit history bigger than my credit card balance. I have student loans that are larger than this but the #1 thing that comes up on my credit report is that I don't have enough debt history. 

Given all of this: 


1) does it even make sense to get a loan when I could just buy it in cash?

2) If yes, would my credit score be hurt if I payed off the loan early? (if I could find a lendor that wouldn't penalize me too much for doing so)

3) would this even be a ""comparable purchase"" to a $25k car? 

4) how the hell am I ever supposed to buy a house when I've never bought one before?

5) any other advice you can give me?

Thanks in advance!",finance,1429660506

personalfinance,How to prioritize paying down student loans vs. saving for retirement vs. saving for a house?,"Hi r/personalfinance, first time poster here (long time reader) and looking for some financial advice.

Background: My wife and I are recently married, ~5 years out of college, and both have decent salaries (collectively about $160K/yr). We have great steady jobs with lots of room for growth. We have zero credit card debt, and collectively about $90K of student loan debt (with an average interest rate of about 5%). We maxed out our Roth IRAs in 2014 (and plan to in 2015), and in addition to that, have a reasonable emergency fund ($10K), and about another $20K just sitting in a savings account.

Our number 1 priority is to be in a house within the next ~3 years, but that means having a fairly sizeable down payment. My questions are:

- Is there a better use of our savings rather than having it sit in an account for a few years collecting ~0% interest? It’s sort of a catch-22 for us: paying down student loan debt would enable us to get approved for a higher mortgage when the time comes (and I guess we can look at that as a guaranteed ROI of ~5%), however given that we’d like to save ~$100K down payment (20% of a reasonable house in our area), I want to know if there are some lower risk options for getting a better ROI without losing all of the savings to student loans?

- That being said, are we being silly maxing out our Roth’s with such significant student loan debt? (I figured that on average, the ROI yearly from my retirement investments would cancel out the student loan interest, and the base amount would generally be available for withdrawal, assuming there isn’t a stock market crash or something drastic...). It’s probably important to note, we already have pretty healthy 401K’s (on the order of $100K).

TLDR; Good salaries, high student loan debt; What’s the best way to distribute our excess income between retirement, student loans, and savings for a house? Thanks!",finance,1429661310

personalfinance,Second degree worth the cost?,"Hi this is my first post here, first I would like to say to everyone thank you so much for all the posts, I have learned more reading here than I have in basically my entire life. I am making this post because of the recent flood of users talking about their crushing student loans, and I don't want to end up like that.

Now for my situation:

* I currently have $22,000 in subsidized federal loans all at 3% to 4.6% interest, they are currently in grace.
* My degree is in biology which is pretty much useless except for further schooling, I am only making a little over minimum wage.
* I live with family so I don't have many expenses.
* I own a car in good condition with no payments left.
* Realistically I only make about ~$20,000 a year now.
* To get into the school I will only be able to work part time starting this summer since I need to take one class in the summer and fall (my job is only M-F), so my pay will be even less, not to mention I will need to pay about $1,800 for the two classes.
* Second degree school would start next January.

I am thinking to go to an accelerated bachelors nursing school next year (January) however the school costs $42,000 which I am assuming I will get loans to pay for (and yes I have looked at all the schools, it's basically my best/only chance for my GPA and other factors).

So here is what I am wondering how much this debt will truly crush me and if this is worth it.

With my second degree I can expect to make $55,000 the first year and about $60,000 the second year (if I am lucky and get a job in california, specifically somewhere like Sacramento with similar CoL to where I am now which is Florida, that $60,000 would be $100,000). Of course I will be in debt $65,000. I can realistically save/pay off $15,000 in debt right after the school (my dad will help me monthly while I am in the school and if I save it all it would be about 15k), leaving me with $50,000. I am planning to live with my family for the first year of working and maybe even second, so once again saving on expenses.

*Lastly* during my first year of working is it really worth doing the 401k employer match or should I just dump all my money into the loan?

I have done the math myself over and over again on repaying the debt and I got about ~2 years (assuming I continue living with family) but I have become really obsessed with this topic due to finding this subreddit so I want to get your guys/gals own opinion. 

**TLDR**: About ~$50,000 in debt total (first + second degree) to make $55,000 the first year with yearly raises, compared to my more or less $20,000 a year now, living with family so no rent, no car payment.

personalfinance,"Lots of options, trying to find a magic bullet.","Hey PF! been a long time since I've asked one of these, and my situation has changed substantially. 

I recently moved my family to Florida for a new career, and a substantial pay / benefits increase.I'm 27 years old, married, with a 7 month old daughter. We're currently renting as we haven't sold our home yet (could be a while), but we're trying to figure out the right course of action once the house sells. I've just realized that after paying nearly $12000 a year for the last 3 years, I've only reduced my student loans by about $8000 (I don't get how this is possible, I don't have any interest rates over 7%, I would have thought almost $40k in payments would have paid down debt more!) so my wife and I decided that we should put a greater focus on the student loans. 



The numbers:

Savings: $15,000

Home Equity: ~$27,000

Investments: ~$5,000 (401k) + $1500 (Stocks) + $600 (Lending Club)

Student loans: $69,700

Currently spending $1300 a month on renting a house.

I figure after we sell the house, we'll have about $40,000 give or take a little. Now, that could be a great down payment on a house, or a big chunk of my student loans gone (As well as our E Fund). 

Here are a couple of options we've been considering:

Extreme expense reduction: We had a hairbrained idea this weekend when we saw a lot for sale. We could purchase a lot with a small mortgage ($30k), and put a used trailer on it (Found one for $16k we liked, another $5k of lot prep + moving trailer) It would use up about $28k in cash, but it would reduce our monthly housing expenses to around $400 a month, which should leave us about $3000 a month to throw at the loans, and we'd just plan on living like that for the next 5ish years. We could pay off my loans in about 2.5 years, and the rest of the time we could work on building a house on the lot. We like this idea the best, as we could could be debt free, with a house totally paid off in probably 7 years. This may be a bit harder to pull off as a few things need to fall into place for it to work. I feel like this is a bit risky as well, I don't know much about buying land. 

Not as extreme: Use $30k to pay against the student loans, retain some for E fund, and downsize to an apartment to reduce our living expenses a little bit. This would probably take us about 4 years to pay off the loans, and we wouldn't be building any equity in the mean time. I'm not a big fan of this one, but not having to maintain a home is somewhat attractive. 

Normal Path: 
Buy a relatively cheap house (Probably between 100k-130k) on a 30 year mortgage. This would be slightly cheaper than renting I think, and would allow us to build a tiny bit of equity while we pay down loans. Once the loans are paid off (Probably 3ish years) start putting a lot more into retirement + double mortgage payments to build equity in the house. 

I really don't know the right way to go here. My wife is on board with whatever, I just want to make the right decision.",finance,1429665456

What's up personal finance. Honestly I have been pretty stressed out lately and feeling a little overwhelmed from all of this, but I have seen a lot of success stories from here so I figured I would give it a shot.


I got into a super good University (Transfer Studend, 22y/o) The only issue is the school costs ~31k a year including all expenses. My family makes beyond the federal cap for financial aid, and I don't have any money saved up because I honestly didn't even think I was going to get accepted / got super depressed last fall.

So basically, I have to find a way to generate a large sum of revenue by this upcomming Fall Semester 2015. I don't have really any direction for what I want to do with my college Degree per say; I just figured it is a step in a positive direction and ultimately the self-discilpline required to graduate from a good university will make me a better person. I am 99% against student loans because leaving college with a huge debt seems very counter-intuitive considering I don't have a specified plan on how to tackle that.

My current plan I am working on is writing as many Scholarship essays as possible, and trying to get into working in the Bar/Service industry to make paper.


31k By this fall seems like a steep mountain. I know I can climb and conquer it if I just stay positive and dedicated, I just need some help.


Any tips, personal stories, penny-pinching techniques, stress relieving techniques; anything would be greatly appreciated. 

I honestly just want to be the best possible version of myself, and I am willing to work as hard as possible to get it. It is just stressful not having an exact plan.

&gt; “On numerous occasions between at least in or about April 2010 and in or about April 2014, Sarao spoofed the market and manipulated the intra-day price for … S&amp;P 500 futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, including on or about 6 May 2010, when the US stock markets plunged dramatically in a matter of minutes in an event that came to be known as the ‘Flash Crash’.”

&gt; The DoJ added: “By allegedly placing multiple, simultaneous, large-volume sell orders at different price points – a technique known as ‘layering’ – Sarao created the appearance of substantial supply in the market … When prices fell as a result of this activity, Sarao allegedly sold futures contracts only to buy them back at a lower price.”

Somehow I expected the account to open right away as I provided all the information needed. Now I'm wondering if this is a bad sign and if I am about to experience one of the horror stories that those few bad reviews talked about (such as processing going on indefinitely or having the application rejected without explanation). I appreciate anyone's input, and I apologize in advance if I've broken any rules.

Edit: Thanks for everyone's two cents. I was absolutely going to go with Ally at first, but then I read a whole bunch of hater reviews and got skeptical. I'm beginning to think I should just ditch this whole online bank idea and stick with the normal ones :(",finance,1429682163

What do you think the best option for this is? should i opt for a longer term deposit with a higher interest rate? or should i get a home loan and buy a house with some of it? or should i invest in a business?
As for the stocks, they are held in Woodside petroleum and Santos, which has decreased in value a lot over the last 6 months. i really want to sell them but have no idea what I'm doing. should i seek a stock broker? should i bail and invest that sum elsewhere, perhaps in a renewable energy firm or something? again i have no idea what i should do or what even to do if i come up with an idea.
Please any advice would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,What kind of debt is a graduate loan that has been removed from my records but is now owed to the school?,"Ok so in 2014 I started graduate school, took out total of 24k in federal loans between two semesters. During this time I was experiencing many medical issues that eventually led me to file a Medical Leave form with my university. 

This form was approved and the grad classes that I took were wiped away from my school record. In doing so, the federal loans ""vanished"" too. I had paid the loans about 8k during that first year because I knew I didnt need all the money I was given - I used what I needed to pay off my bills and gave the rest back. 

So I started getting money in my bank account (8k) because the gov't was returning it to me. Now the debt has landed on the school. My university is asking me to pay that money back to them.

  Ok not a problem, I have been paying it back. My question is, what kind of debt is this now? It does not show up on my credit report. its like non existent at the moment. I know if I dont pay it, they will send it to collections and THEN it will be a part of my report.

My university was nice and gave me 24 months to pay off $16k at 0% int. ~666.66 (too many sixes haha) I have paid 2.5k already. 

My finances:

Income - 
$2k/month

Bills
Cable/internet - $120/mo
Groceries/Gas- $350/mo

Debt
BoA CC - $1.7k at 0% until 1/16 ( havent used in over a year)
Discover CC - $2.5k at 0% until 10/16 (i use this card only at the moment)
Citi CC - $0 at 19.99% int (i rarely use this one)
University - $13.5k

Payments
Boa CC- $200/mo
Discover CC - $150/mo
University - $1000/mo 


I have it pretty good at the moment. Im living with my parents, dont pay rent, only for the cable/internet and just pay for food to survive and gas for work ( i live 22miles away from work) I just turned 25 too, if that matters for anything. 

Either way, I want to use my money as best as possible. My plan is to send 1k a month to the university but I do have until Dec 2016 (20 months left), but what kind of debt does this fall under? I hate that I am paying so much to it, but it wont be affecting my credit score. oh btw..FICO 760

personalfinance,Deciding on my first credit card. One of the big 4 or a small bank with better terms? (AUS),"Greetings, first time poster here, show me some love..

So I've been making comparisons in regards to which credit card would suit me best and I've narrowed it down to two. Either choose a low interest rate, $55 annual fee card with my current bank (one of the big 4 banks) or a beautiful even lower interest rate card that has a $0 annual fee with a small bank (has no branches). 

Benefits for staying with my bank:
1. Easy access to all accounts.
2. May be able to get the annual fee waived. (probs only for 1st year)

Benefits for smaller bank:
1. No annual fee, better interest rate.
2. Better savings interest rate, especially if I were to move all my accounts over this bank (makes me wonder if I should).
3. Would in a small way be supporting smaller business and be internally showing my disapproval for how the big banks affiliate themselves with keeping the mining business alive, widening the wealth disparity, not supporting renewables etc.

Are there any benefits for sticking with a more established bank, especially when considering future home loans and investments, that I don't know about?

And again would there be any disadvantages to moving all my accounts to a smaller bank with better terms, or even just signing up for their credit card?

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks redditworldx",finance,1429712201

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, a Global Reserve (would love feedback)","It feels like we’re about month six into an indefinite branding war with the mainstream financial community and even some of our own over whether bitcoin per se, or blockchain technology (sans deflationary currency) is the winning fintech innovation from 2009. And admittedly, there are good arguments against bitcoin becoming a legitimate currency — or even a rails of payments used by anyone who prefers to keep their bank account intact and stay on the right side of the law.

For instance, there is still institutional fear that the technology is infeasible to use for payments because it’s impossible to reverse charges, and difficult to surveil the bitcoin network for bad actors and black market transactions (both problems seem solvable by bitcoin startups). There is wariness to buy-in to the “bitcoin as a backbone” argument where institutions hide the currency and use the tech and its token behind the scenes, mainly because bitcoin is still (according to its own chief scientist) in a beta release. The security of the network is still relatively weak, and hundred billion dollar multi-nationals aren’t going to invest in a network that might cease to exist in five years without any clear contingency plans.

As a Bitcoin permabull, these short term challenges don’t bother me. But I list them because they are rational concerns and ones that will take years to quell at an institutional level. In the meantime, you’ll see dabbling in alternative protocols like Ripple and Stellar and Ethereum and Hyperledger, and (gasp) these same institutions will even fork open-source code and make it their own. (Michael Lewis writes in Flash Boys about the laughable degree to which Goldman makes open-source code their own “IP”.) I think Tim Swanson’s paper nailed it (for the most part) and that this experimentation with blockchain-not-bitcoin is perfectly fine.

Bitcoin might not ultimately make it as a currency in the world’s largest economies, and it might prove to be a pretty poor store of value if its corresponding tech is relegated to second-tier status in favor of a more government/bank friendly protocol. With that in mind, competition is healthy and new ideas are welcome when it comes blockchain tech, I think.

But there is a huge caveat.

The longer that bitcoin survives, the more likely it is to disrupt a large swath of developing economy currencies. I’m increasingly convinced that Wences et al have been right all along with bitcoin as a value store (reserve) emerging as its hidden-in-plain-sight killer app. In a stroke of irony, we might be looking at 50–50 odds that bitcoin’s character arc goes from cryptoanarchist currency, to commodity that powers 1.0 financial technology, and back to functional currency reserve for much of the developing world. And if that’s where it settles for the medium-term, it would still be a phenomenal outcome.

Consider: Bitcoin inflation slows to ~4% by 2017 — reasonable by most any economist’s modern standards and not too far off of the target thresholds for most central banks. This is also a predictable 4%. Yes, that figure belies the forex swings that bitcoin will inevitably experience as a young currency, but the rate of seignorage will still be quite low. And less new bitcoin money creation will inevitably reduce sell-side pressure from miners as a percentage of total network transactions. That could and probably will help the market stabilize enough to price more and cheaper derivatives to hedge out volatility for those who don’t want it.

Consider: Most developing economy currencies suck, and will be debased into oblivion within two decades, if not much sooner. If you believe your current currency has a 50% chance of being completely destroyed in the next ten years, and think bitcoin has a 50% chance of being alive at all, it makes sense to buy bitcoin with your less sexy currency. It probably only takes one country to start buying bitcoin for their central bank (as if it’s gold), for others to follow suit in rapid succession. (FWIW, Gyft’s Vinny Lingham, who has proven to have an uncanny knack for picking the price trends that matter, agrees with me.)

Consider: Dozens of countries around the world already operate on a two currency system with the US dollar as a viable alternative to their local options. Economists’ dismissiveness of bitcoin as a potential reserve currency on the grounds that “governments and their central banks would never cede that kind of monetary control” ignores pretty much all of the evidence that already exists which shows how it is an extremely rare luxury to live in a country with a central bank that has any flexibility whatsoever with respect to monetary policy. i.e. if a country’s central bank stores dollars and gold, it might like BTC.

Consider: Not even the US dollar is likely to be the world’s reserve currency in 20 years. I have begged on social media for some smart economist to refute this, but none have so far. It’s easy to look at our surging economy and think “we’re still the best”, but China’s economy will dwarf our own by 2040. India will likely eclipse us as well. And its a slam dunk that frontier markets will continue to command a larger chunk of the global GDP pie. (Europe is still probably screwed.) In a world where the US is the second or third largest economy in the world and commands 15% of its GDP rather than 25%, who honestly thinks the greenback is going to be the only currency reserve? (That’s not rhetorical, by the way. Send me a counter-argument and I’ll reprint it.)

If all that is true, then it follows: In a world where even the mack daddy of all fiat reserve currencies is dethroned, and a neutral, stable, predictable alternative exists, some countries are going to start taking a chance on bitcoin. It really only takes one successful experiment to create a domino effect, and those tier II (and III and IV) government currencies will collectively fade to black. The longer bitcoin survives, the longer we have to build the robust infrastructure to support a fully functional bitcoin ecosystem that could swoop in to support an entire small country. All we need to do is stay heads down and wait for one regional storm to brew in a world that is frankly already plagued by currency wars.

In a stroke of irony, policymakers and Keynesian economists might finally see the “bancor” global reserve currency that their idol John Maynard Keynes proposed 80 years ago.

personalfinance,Selling a Car that Is No Longer Used - Which is Better Option in Long Run?,"My husband (34) and I (28) are trying to sort out our finances and finally stick to a budget. We both have decent-paying jobs (me 90k, him 75k), live in a major metro area (Boston), and have a lot of student debt (around 200k together; I went to law school, he has 2 graduate degrees). We have no credit card debt, we own a condo with a mortgage of $1200 in the city, have house bills totaling around 500 a month + 2 car payments (see below), &amp; both max out 401k contributions... our only other expenses are going out to eat/entertainment, which we're trying to pull back on a bit as well. After both working jobs in the suburbs for the last 4 years, I have a new job that allows me to rely on public transportation (husband still drives 100 miles a day, round trip to work). At this point, we are thinking of selling one of our two cars; I'm hoping we can save a decent chunk of change every month in car payments/insurance/gas, and I'm wondering if this is the right move long-term.

My husband owes about 12k on his car, which is a 2012 Honda Accord EX-L. The car currently has about 65K miles on it. I recently purchased a car (almost a year ago now), a Subaru Impreza Sport limited 2.0 (2015), and I owe 22.5K (only has about 7K miles total on it). Interest rates are 0% and 1.9%, respectively. We live in Boston, so while both cars are decent in snow, the Subaru is obviously better.
I'm definitely leaning toward getting rid of one of the cars, but I question which one is the best one to let go. I worry (perhaps irrationally) about needing a car again in a year or two if I happen to switch jobs (I have no plans to) or if my site location moves (a possibility, which is unclear), so that's holding me back a bit. We don't want to stay in our current condo forever (but plan on staying put for at least a few years), and we want to have children in a few years - though both of these things are flexible in terms of timing.

Should I go with my gut and attempt to sell one of our cars, as it would save us significantly in the present time? Which one makes the most sense to hang onto?

We bought a house for 87k a few years back (while I was the only one working) with a pretty bad interest rate (6%).  Currently we owe 61k on the house and are looking to refinance.  Our mortgage with tax and insurance is about $600 per month.

Now, here is where it gets sticky...we may be in this house another 3 years, or we may be in the house for only 13 more months..I'm not sure - I absolutely know that we will probably move within 3-4 y ears max though as we will need a bigger house as we have more kids, and we can afford a bigger house now with our income. 

Also, even if we wanted to move in 1 year, I'm not sure how quickly our house would sell....there seems to be a lot of inventory in this area of town, and I'm also toying with the idea of renting the house instead of selling when we move.  
I want to refinance and am strongly leaning towards doing a 3.75%, 15 year fixed no closing cost loan with my current mortgage holder (it is a true no closing cost loan- with us only paying the state fee ($100 I believe).  
I could get down closer to 3% for a 30 year and of course do closing costs for that better rate.
Right now I think it is absolutely the best idea to go with the no/low closing cost/higher apr deal, since our future in this house is probably limited and this is such a cheap house/mortgage that recouping the closing costs would take us possibly longer than we need it to.

personalfinance,Tax/credit implications of someone paying my debt?,"Hi there, 

I guess I should start by saying I have an obscene amount of student loan debt. Like, way more than anyone rightfully should. Most of that is to due unfairly high interest rates on private loans (since I didn't get enough federal to cover the cost), that I was told I was not allowed to refinance.   

A very generous and close relative of mine has graciously offered to pay off this debt for me, and allow me to pay them monthly at a 3% interest rate, instead of my current 11% rate. This will allow me to take my current loan term from 20 years to 15 years, AND save 100.00 a month.  

My relative is well off and is currently working with their attorney to figure out the details and then we will have another discussion.

My questions are:  

* How do you think this will work? Do you think they will just pay the loan in my name and then draft a private contract where I pay them? OR, do you think they will somehow ""buy it from the bank"" and ""take it over"" for me? I'm not sure how that would work.  
* If they DO just pay it using my online account and draft a private contract with me, what kind of tax implications does that have?
* Would that money somehow be considered extra income? How do I deal with that? I clearly can't afford to pay taxes on 49,000.00 of extra income. 
*  Would that effect my credit score? 
* Is there anything else I should consider, do, know about, actions I should take?

personalfinance,Raiding Roth IRA to avoid paying PMI,"So I know the conventional advice is to save for shot term goals in liquid, non risky accounts. But considering I didn't know when I'd want to buy a house (and I still don't know, but it could be a lot closer to the time that I take the plunge), I stayed in the market instead of keeping my cash on the sidelines.

Here's the scenario I've run. Let's say that I have about $31,500 in a Roth IRA that is eligible to be withdrawn penalty free.

Let's say my gf and I want to buy a $200,000 house, and let's say for the sake of argument that we can get a seller's ""concession"" whereby we buy the house for ~$210,000 instead of $200,000, and they ""pay"" our closing costs. This would help us achieve a higher LTV than if we just rolled the closing costs into the loan.

The least we could put down to get a conventional mortgage would be $6,300. That would be 3% down (97% LTV). At that price point though, it looks like we'd have to pay 1.05% annual PMI (https://www.mgic.com/loan-officers/why-mi.html) with our high credit scores. If we bump it up to 5% down, PMI drops to 0.54%.

So $210,000 X .0054=$1,134 going toward PMI in the first year. And I assume every year after that until we hit 20%, because even though the PMI rate is supposed to go down as LTV goes up, it's probably cost prohibitive to get an annual appraisal done every year before we hit 20%.

So what's the opportunity cost? If my $31,500 stayed in the market and earned 7% a year, it would earn $2,205 each year. Even at 3.5%, it would earn $1,102, or about what I'd pay in PMI. It's also worth noting that PMI is tax deductible, but on such a ""cheap"" house, I don't think we would hit the threshold to itemize. 

Obviously investing is risky, and anything can happen. But it looks like the numbers favor not raiding the Roth IRA on average. Am I missing anything here? Will putting 20% down get me a much better interest rate that I'd need to factor into this calculation? Is it worth it to ""pay extra"" to buy that security blanket of knowing that with 20% down I'd be pretty well insulated from a potential market correction that could put me underwater?

It does looking like raiding the Roth to get from 97% LTV to 95% LTV is a winning proposition. I'd need $4,200 more to get there, and I'd save $1,071 in PMI premiums annually. A 7% return on $4,200 invested would only be $294. But after getting to 95% LTV, it looks like the benefit declines and then goes away.",finance,1429726443

personalfinance,Took my first step to financial independence by buying a duplex. Advice needed!,"This is my first time posting on reddit so forgive me if I've broken any rules!

A little background: I am a 24 year old college graduate with a stable job. I quickly became best friends with one of my coworkers, who is 25 years old and also a college grad. We have the same income, roughly $53,000 a year after bonuses. We became roommates and discovered that we have the same financial goals in life. Fast forward a year later and we are closing on our first duplex. We will live one one side of the duplex and rent out the other side.

We found a duplex for sale by owner in our desired area and, after negotiating, agreed on a $130,000 sale price. My mother is a former real estate agent and my roommates father is a general contractor so we were able to draft all the contracts ourselves and had a trained eye on hand when it came to inspections, etc. 

Through a lot of discipline over the past year we were able to save a combined $35,000. We are putting 20% down ($26,000) on 30 yr, 4% interest rate. The seller is contributing $1000 to closing costs and $2000 for the inspection settlement. The property will be titled Tenants In Common. 

Our payment after taxes and insurance totals $716/month. We have a verbal commitment from some friends who want to rent out the other side of the duplex for $1000/month. 

Our goal is to be closing on another duplex this time next year and two every year there after. If our calculations are correct, we need 20 units producing an average of $800/month each before financial independence would be a reality.

Last summer I got my first credit card which was one of the secure plus cards  with a $500 limit, I pay the card of every month and have never missed a payment. I requested a credit limit raise and to unsecure it. At first it was denied due to me not having a stable income but after 2 days was accepted and as of then have a 794 credit score. I plan to ask for credit limit raises every six months. Lastly this card is through my local credit union.

Since I will be graduating I will have loans the amount is around $80,000 all through parent plus loans so they are Federally backed and repayment will begin in October since I graduate in May. They payments for this will be around $1,200/month for 10 years.

I plan to become a law enforcement officer in my area which starts out at $44,xxx a year with full benefits which isn't a big deal since I am fully insured with government insurance till I'm 26 if I recall. (Please no cop hate or political arguments over this.)

Some more background info:

* I will be living at home rent free for however long I want

* I do not pay phone, car, or insurance. My parents take care of this

* My only food expenses is whatever I feel like making or going out to get since my mom or dad make dinner almost every night.

My questions:

I will estimate that I will make $10-14,000 this summer working my summer job since I made $11,000 last summer making $12.50 an hour and $2,100 a month while at army basic with minimal expenses so that is about $12,000 estimated. (this is all pre-tax and my state doesn't have income tax so it is just federal)
 
* Should I put this money into a savings account so I have an emergency fund or throw everything I can at my students loan to pay them off as quick as possible?

* Should I apply for income based repayment since it will most likely be way below the $1,200 monthly payments and just drag them out for 10 years since the job I will be doing after getting home from basic will have the 10 years of payment and forgiveness deal since it will be a civil servant job.

* Would putting the maximum I'm allowed towards a Thrifts savings plan be better than putting what I earn into my savings?

If anyone has any other advice or questions feel free to contribute. I personally feel that I have a solid foundation but others will be able to tell me otherwise if I am incorrect. I am honestly looking for guidance since I have not had much financial guidance in the past and honestly don't want to be stuck with these student loans for the rest of my life.

personalfinance,"For the rest of 2015, should I make traditional or Roth contributions to 401k/IRA?","Graduating college next month, starting work June 1st. Salary is $65,000 per year which works out to about $37,900 for the 7 months I'm working in 2015.

I'm graduating with about $21k in student loan debt at low interest rates plus about $9k in credit card debt that I took on out of ignorance when my parents unexpectedly ran out of money. $4k of that CC debt is on cards that are 0% until April 2016.

I'm trying to come up with a budgeting plan for the rest of the year and am weighing doing traditional vs. Roth contributions to my 401k and IRA.

Long term goal is financial independence by my mid to late 40s and be able to travel a ton. Not really sure how to estimate how much I'd need to take per year or whether it would be lower or higher than my current marginal rate.

If I go traditional, my taxes will be a lot lower, allowing me to tackle the high-interest CC debt in the first 3 months. I've calculated that if I max out a traditional IRA (including contributions to 2015 in the first 4 months of next year) and contribute $9k to a traditional 401k, I'll need to pay about $560 per month towards taxes.

If I contribute with Roth instead, I need to pay $1025 per month in taxes. I'd tackle the high-interest CC debt in 4 months, max out a Roth IRA, and contribute about $5400 to my Roth 401k.

For 2016 I don't expect a promotion but most likely a 3-5% raise in December 2015 or January 2016. Regardless I'd think I'd switch to Roth for my 2016 contributions, using the first 4 months to finish out my 2015 IRA and pay off the $4k in 0% CCs. Since I'm working for 12 months instead of 7 I'll have higher taxes, about $1450 per month. If I did traditional to get max deductions taxes would only drop to about $1300 per month, hence why I don't think that would be smart. Please correct me if I'm wrong on that.

That still leaves me able to start making equal monthly contributions to the Roth IRA, and step up the Roth 401k contributions in May for a total of $12,750 for 2016.

We have two kids with our third on the way. My wife  stays at home but runs a moderately successful Etsy store. We currently live 45 min from work in a low rent area, no crime but lot's of kids that come from bad home situations, they are good kids but not the best influence on my kid, My son's best friend mother's current boyfriend live's in a half way house? That feels really petty to write out but there it is.

I just took my current job, it's pay is less than my value but it's a good start up and I'm working with some really talented guys, I will be here for at least another year before I'd consider switching jobs. We had planed waiting to purchase a home but it seems like that might not be the best idea?

There is an area that is 15 min from my work that qualifies for the USDA mortgage program. No Down, low Rate, PMI nearly half of FHA. 

Housing prices are hovering around $230k and up, rising very fast, about 8% a year on average, as well the USDA designation isn't likely to last very much longer

How do I quantify the risk/reward? 

* I can qualify for around $240K. 

* Housing prices are far more likely to rise than fall. I've been watching this area for the last two year, prices are rising 8% on average. 

* Interest rates are more likely to rise than fall? At least, they are unlikely to fall much more than they have this year? 

* We would be pretty tight budget wise for at least a year or until I find a new job? Risky, yes but my skill set is very much in demand and that doesn't look to change in the next few years. 

* We have a three month emergency fund that we wouldn't have to touch to purchase the home.

Obviously this isn't ideal but I can't help wondering if the sacrifice might be worth it in the long run? If interest rates hit 4% - 5%, that would probably slow housing prices a bit but by how much? I'm imagining that when I finally ready to purchase, I'm going to be looking at $280k base and around 5%+ interest vs a 230k home now that may be worth upwards of 280k? Yes/No?

financialindependence,IRA Early Withdrawals,"There are many posts here about withdrawing money from retirement accounts, particularly IRAs, before turning 59.5.  Most of them involve a ""Roth ladder"" which requires 5 years from conversions to become seasoned.

I'm curious as to the actual penalties from just withdrawing from retirement accounts early.  Unfortunately, most of the information about this topic on the Internet says ""don't do it"" but doesn't really detail the exact consequences.

If I understand correctly, unqualified early distributions from either a traditional or Roth IRA will result in paying income taxes on the amount, plus a 10% penalty tax.  Now this is devastating for a Roth IRA, because it means you will basically be taxed twice.  (For this exercise, let's pretend we're withdrawing earnings - not direct contributions or conversions).  But it seems like a really ""light"" penalty for traditional IRAs.

Let's say you're in a 30% income tax bracket (federal plus state).  You have $1000 to allocate to either a traditional IRA or a regular taxable account, knowing full well that you'll be using this money next year when you retire early.  If you pick the taxable account, you pay $300 in taxes and end up with $700 next year.  But what if you pick the IRA?  Wouldn't you end up with $1000 in the IRA, and as long as your *effective* tax rate (not marginal bracket) in early retirement was less than 20%, wouldn't you be able to get more than $700?  In other words, does it make sense to purposefully allocate money to a traditional IRA or traditional 401k when you know full well that you'll break the rules and have to pay a penalty?

Maybe I'm not understanding this properly - maybe the 10% tax gets applied to your entire IRA, or something like that, because it seems like stuffing your IRA and 401k is always a better choice, unless you're actually going to use the money before you retire.",finance,1429745855

Have a plan in mind but would like some advice/guidance first.","First off, thank you in advance for even bothering to look at this post. Apologies if it's long and I hope I don't come as ignorant as I feel about all this. Any advice is welcomed.

I have roughly $5,000 in debt across two credit cards, an in-store credit card at Best Buy ($1,500) limit and a Visa credit card ($3,500 limit) with my credit union. Both are near maxed. The BB one simply because of overspending on christmas and living a bit beyond my means. My Visa is maxed out nearly due to health and medical bills that have piled up over the past year. This time last year I had $400 of debt and that's it. I expected I would have more money than I ended up getting, so now I'm paying for it.

I currently make $12/hr and my paychecks are generally $650-800 after taxes, medical, etc. My rent is $750 so that takes an entire paycheck and sometimes a bit of the second. I understand that I've lived beyond my means for the past year and have already cut my expenses down to this quick little expense list:

Rent - $750  
Phone - $125  
Insurance - $50  
Utilities $40  
Food - $100  
Entertainment - $50  
Gas - $60  
Internet - $60  

About $1250ish in expenses from $1300-1600 a month. I've been paying about $50 a month to my store credit card and roughly $100 to my visa. This hasn't really been getting me anywhere as my BB card has a horrible interest rate of 25.26% or more. My Visa is anywhere between 8 and 13%, I'll figure that out over the next few days.

So finally it comes to this, my options. I'd like a little advice on them as I'm not sure which to do. All of my options include knocking out my BB card as fast as possible so I'm not stuck paying 25% interest. I prefer to knock out the lower balance but higher interest card first. All of these options are going to ding my credit score in the short term I believe.

**Option A**: Ask for limit raises on one or both of my credit cards. If I can lower my debt utilization it'll help my credit score in the long run. Ideally I'd like to push my Visa $3,500 limit to $6,000 or more. If I was able to do that, I'd be able to borrow cash from that Visa and pay off my Best Buy card entirely, putting me at about $5,000 in debt on my Visa. Granted I wouldn't have erased any debt but it would push my utilization down from 99% to 84% on my visa and it would put my Best Buy card to 0% utilization. If I get a bigger limit raise, it'll lower utilization even more. 

This option would allow me to only pay on one card with a much better interest rate as I know I'm getting slaughtered by the Best Buy interest rate.


**Option B**: Apply for a new credit card with a fairly high limit if possible ($5,000+). After getting said card, pay my rent for 2-3 months with that card and instead of paying my rent with my paychecks, I can put an entire paycheck as a payment to one or both of my cards. Two $750 payments to my Best Buy card would knock it out completely and still allow me to pay on both my new card and my Visa. Depending on the interest rate of the new card, I may pay rent for a third month with it (while paying some on it) and put a sizable chunk in my $3,500 Visa. I wouldn't do anymore than 3 months at the most thought as I'd hate to have $2,800+ of debt on one card and $2,800+ of debt on another. That'd just be increasing my debt but lowering utilization.

This option would be shifting debt rather than eliminating it, but depending on the card it may help me in the long run.

**Option C**: Balance transfer. I've read up on them and it's kind of a combination of options A and B. I'm not sure if my credit union would allow me to raise my limit and transfer my Best Buy balance to that card, and if they did I don't know what kind of limit they'd even give me. This option requires more research as I don't know if should try to go through my credit union first or try another companys card. I'd plan to transfer my BB balance and possibly my Visa balance depending on interest rates.

**Option D**: Get a loan?

Out of the options I have, I feel I can work on my Visa balance the best, regardless of how high it is due to the better interest rate. As for monthly payments, depending on hours I can pay anywhere from $150-250 depending on my paychecks. I've dropped a lot of my spending habits and have cut everything down to my budget. One problem I have is that my health insurance through work is the highest available one, meaning I'm losing tons of money into health insurance that I've unfortunately been unable to change. I figure I spend about $100-200 on that alone but I'd have to do more research.


**TL;DR**
Option A: Raise limits, use higher limit to borrow against and pay off lower card, then make payments on higher card as planned.

Option B: Third credit card, pay rent on that, use entire paycheck(s) to pay off lower card, then make payments on visa and new card.

Option C: Balance transfer to new card or raise limit of existing Visa and balance transfer to that.

Option D: Loan?

assume that the +/- 50 rpm is delivered by a servo, wired up to the gas and brake peddle of a car.

one drive shaft is connected directly to the induction motor driving the car.
the other is connected to a small synchronous motor producing constant volts/hz 3phase sine waves, fed into some pwm generation logic to drive the induction motor.

note that we're dealing with 3 phases and direction matters.

it seems to me there should be some fundamentally simple way to do this.

imagine for a moment you have a synchronous generator coupled electrically through slip rings, driven from something rotating, as you rotate the stator of the machine, obviously the frequency will increase or decrease and so will the voltage.

there's got to be a way to do this electrically, without using microprocessors.

worldpolitics,"Can we please put an end to the Zionist historical narrative that ""Jews have been victims for centuries""? Jewish leaders have had real power for centuries, often abused it, and from time to time Jews underneath them paid the price (and this book by Jewish scholar Benjamin Ginsberg documents it)","Deadly enemy, deadly friend http://www.thornwalker.com/ditch/deadlyenemy.htm

By Dr. STEPHEN J. SNIEGOSKI

Benjamin Ginsberg's **The Fatal Embrace: Jews and the State,**  which deals with the rise and fall of Jews in different societies, is an intellectual bombshell. A liberal American Jew who teaches political science at Johns Hopkins, Ginsberg makes observations about Jewish influence in government and society that would be deemed anti-Semitic if expressed by a Gentile. Ginsberg, however, does not criticize that Jewish power for being harmful to Gentiles; his only concern is the harm it can cause for Jews by provoking Gentiles to anti-Semitic actions.

Outlining Jewish power since the Middle Ages, Ginsberg notes that Jews helped kings expand and centralize their realms; in mediæval Spain, for example, Jews were closely tied to the monarchies, largely, but not solely, in the financial sphere. But they also took the lead in working for the revolutionary destruction of societies hostile to Jews; thus, Jews played key roles in European revolutions, liberal and Communist alike.

In the liberal revolutions and in the development of liberal states, Jews propagandized the public and financed liberal groups. In France, Jews helped establish the Third Republic in the 1870s; their influence loomed especially large in the republic's anti-clerical campaigns. Jewish financial and media power also provided the underpinning for the Weimar Republic, whose depiction as the Judenrepublik  by anti-Semites was not far from the mark. In late 19th-century Britain, the Jewish-dominated press championed imperialism, which benefited Jewish finance. And during the early stages of the Soviet regime, Jews were numerous in leadership positions, especially in the secret police and the propaganda agencies, which they dominated. In contrast to Judeophiles who claim that Jews observe a higher humanitarian ethos, Ginsberg acknowledges that Jewish Communists played a ruthless role in liquidating their opposition.

Ginsberg warns that as a result of their great power, Jews become a highly visible target for the enemies of the regime and often suffer group destruction with the regime's demise. Thus in the late 15th century, Ferdinand and Isabella expelled the Jews from Spain, where they had occupied key positions under previous monarchs. In Germany, Hitler eliminated the Jews along with the Weimar Republic; what enabled Nazism to succeed was a coalescence of lower- and upper-class opposition to Jewish power. Where such a fusion of divergent classes does not take place, as in the French Third Republic, Jewish power survives despite a high degree of anti-Semitism.

The Jewish fall from power does not always require the demise of a friendly regime. Sometimes a previously hospitable regime will eliminate Jews when they are no longer necessary for the maintenance of power, as was the case in the Soviet Union when Stalin dispensed with Jews. Ginsberg's fundamental theory is that the Jewish close relationship with the state is a ""fatal embrace"": the achievement of great power, and the concomitant high visibility, invite group destruction as situations change.

Ginsberg devotes the greatest part of his book to the history of Jewish power in America. German Jews gained significant power in the United States after the Civil War, largely in the realm of finance. Jews financed the U.S. regime's Civil War debt, the debts of the reconstructed Southern states, and the nascent industries. In essence, according to our author, Jews were a part of the new business and industrial class of the Gilded Age, and became ""identified with the worst excesses of the nineteenth-century industrial order."" (p. 75) Jewish prominence induced an anti-Semitic opposition from Southern and Western agrarians (Populists), and from old-stock New England patricians. Reacting to that anti-Semitic criticism, the Gentile business class jettisoned its ties with the Jews and aligned itself with the patricians. Thus, the 1890s saw the emergence both of exclusive clubs that barred Jews and of anti-Jewish quotas in the Ivy League colleges. Having been thrust out of the business elite, Jews sought to alter the American economic system, Ginsberg writes. They identified with the Progressive reform movement and — on the part of the newly immigrating Eastern European Jews — with radical socialism. The Jewish role in the Progressive movement crested in the Wilson administration, with Louis Brandeis playing a major role in the creation of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Trade Commission. However, the Jewish rise was transitory, cut short by the anti-radical Red Scare in the aftermath of World War I, which destroyed radical and reform movements as well as (in Ginsberg's view) an emerging welfare state.

It was with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal that Jews gained long-term power in the United States, power that continues into the present. Jews served as Roosevelt's idea men and staffed his New Deal agencies. They played a fundamental part in fashioning the centralized American welfare state — and Ginsberg asserts that they created it to serve their own interests. In contrast to American Protestants' success in the private sector, Ginsberg writes that Jews ""relied upon the state and the public economy to achieve positions of influence and status in American society."" (p. 103) That account contrasts, we should note, with Thomas Sowell's portrayal of Jewish success via the free market...

By the end of the Great Society reforms, Jews, in Ginsberg's view, had become the major force in American politics and government: ""From the 1970s onward, Jews led or were influential in most, though not all, of the political reform, feminist, consumer rights, gay rights, environmentalist and other public interest groups and related foundations, study groups, and think tanks that came to dominate the Democratic party during the 1970s and continue to be the leading forces within that party today."" (p. 137) And Jews wield considerable power in the institutions of the American welfare state, holding as they do prominent positions in the ""public or quasi-public economy of government agencies, helping professions, private foundations, think tanks, and universities."" (p. 140) Since Jewish power and wealth is either directly or indirectly tied to the national government, rather than to state and local governments or to the strictly private sector, Jews have a vested interest in its maintenance and expansion. In short, Ginsberg contends, Jews support the liberal welfare state for reasons of material self-interest: ""Jewish liberalism is more an institutional  than an attitudinal  phenomenon. It is associated more with Jews' political linkages and involvements than with their underlying attitudes."" (p. 143)

Ginsberg attributes the rise of black anti-Semitism over the past couple decades to the desire of upwardly mobile blacks to share in the positions of power held by Jews in the welfare-state apparatus. Jews may oppose some black activities, but they cannot become too critical of blacks because it is the idea of helping disadvantaged blacks that provides the ""legitimation of the American welfare state."" Indeed, Ginsberg maintains, ""Many Jews and Jewish organizations believe that the fundamental interests of Jews are so closely tied, both politically and institutionally, to those of blacks, that it is sometimes necessary to support black demands even when, conceived narrowly or in the short term, these seem to be disadvantageous to Jews."" (p. 165) It is that vested interest in the liberal welfare state that prevented most Jews from turning to Republicanism in the 1980s despite the Republicans' support for pro-Jewish positions on racial quotas and the defense of Israel.

Although the overwhelming majority of Jews did not turn to Reagan Republicanism in the 1980s, ""Jews played important roles in implementing the administration's economic and foreign policy objectives,"" Ginsberg writes. ""The association of Jews with Reaganism, especially in the realm of foreign policy, helped to heighten the anti-Semitism of forces on the political Left but produced a measure of philo-Semitism on the right, most notably among Protestant fundamentalists."" (p. 188) Neoconservative Reaganauts identified Israel as America's ""strategic asset"" in the Cold War, and Israel actually helped the United States fight communism in Latin America and elsewhere. In the economic realm, Jewish parvenu financiers such as Michael Milken were the major beneficiaries of the Reagan rollback of regulations.

Ginsberg claims that the Republicans, unable to attract any significant number of Jews to their side, abandoned their support of the neocon elite with the end of the Cold War. Israel simply was no longer needed as an ally. Thus President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker tried to coerce Israel into following American Middle East policy and in so doing alienated their neoconservative support. Ginsberg, who completed Fatal Embrace  at the beginning of the Clinton administration, emphasizes the large number of Jews who were entering that regime, reinforcing his theme of American Jewry's continued identification with liberal Democrats.

The author attempts to gauge whether Jewish power — which aroused strong opposition in the past — is threatened today. Despite the explicit anti-Semitism of blacks, Ginsberg doubts that they pose a direct threat to Jews because of their dependence on the welfare state that Jews supervise: blacks and Jews are ""locked into a long-term relationship which neither can easily abandon."" (p. 183) Black anti-Semitic rhetoric, however, has loosened the taboo against anti-Semitism in American society, according to Ginsberg, so that white right-wing forces — Joe Sobran, Patrick Buchanan, David Duke, paleoconservatives — can attack Jews and their agenda. Ginsberg believes that those right-wingers, if they should use the correct populist appeal to unite upper- and lower-class whites in what he characterizes as the Nazi manner, could pose a formidable threat to American Jewry: ""An alliance of radical populists and respectable conservatives would almost inevitably make vigorous use of anti-Semitic themes to attack the liberal Democratic regime, and the Jews would find themselves locked in the fatal embrace of yet another state."" (p. 243)

***

Ginsberg is far more explicit on the reality of Jewish power than any other pro-Jewish author of which this reader is aware. However, he leaves some important matters unresolved.

First, it must be asked: What enables Jews to dominate societies? Ginsberg says they have certain talents — scholarly, business, managerial — not possessed by the bulk of the population. However, he does not claim (like Nathaniel Weyl) that Jews are innately more intelligent than other people. It is odd that societies supposedly based on equality (such as America's current welfare state) would come to reflect greater Jewish dominance. With all the purported equal educational opportunities and aid to the disadvantaged, one would think that social and economic differences among groups would lessen over time. Of course, it could be argued that the real purpose of the liberal welfare state is not to help the disadvantaged but rather to keep them dependent in order to maintain the rationale for the welfare institutions that Jews dominate. Ginsberg does not even hint at this explanation.

Also problematic is the author's understanding of anti-Semitism. Ginsberg characterizes as anti-Semitic those Gentiles who are critical of Jewish power and its uses. Therefore, anti-Semitism does not necessarily entail racial hatred, threats of racial expulsion or racial extermination, or even lies. A statement can be perfectly truthful and still qualify as anti-Semitic! Despite this apparent meaning, Ginsberg still gives anti-Semitism a negative connotation. Presumably, it is wrong for Gentiles to oppose the Jewish agenda. A reader of Ginsberg's book should understand from the outset that the work is directed to Jews and Judeophiles, and that the author's concern is the long-term effect of Jewish power on Jews. He does not dwell on the negative impacts that Jewish power has had on Gentiles, even though he cites examples in which Gentiles have been harmed — such as in the Soviet Union.

Finally, Ginsberg underplays the importance of neoconservatism. (Paul Gottfried, the foremost paleoconservative analyst of neoconservatism, has underscored the significant power of neoconservatism in such works as The Conservative Movement. ) Bush and Baker did anger neocons, but neoconservatism still dominates the Republican Party and the American conservative establishment. Neoconservatism simply does not threaten the welfare-state apparatus that provides Jews a base of power. As paleoconservatives correctly point out, neoconservatism simply acts to coopt the conservative thrust of the electorate, rendering it harmless to those whose interests are served by the welfare state. Besides being innocuous to the domestic welfare state, a neocon Republican regime might better serve Jewish foreign policy interests than a liberal Democratic one. It could pursue a Zionist-oriented globalistic foreign policy without the inhibitions of the Democratic Left. And having neocons in strategic positions in the Republican Party means that the Jews have placed their eggs in more than one basket: no matter who controls the government, Democrat or Republican, Jewish power remains intact. Outside of the Jewish orbit there remain only Patrick Buchanan and the paleoconservatives, whom Ginsberg sees as imminent threats to Jewish power and its agenda.

Despite some questionable interpretations, The Fatal Embrace  is of immense value for its candid discussion of Jewish power, especially since it is authored by a Jew who identifies closely with Jewish interests. It is must reading for anyone interested in this taboo but critically important subject.

personalfinance,"Hit my goal - $0 to $100,000 invested/earned in 3 years. Thanks everyone.","3 years ago, I decided to get serious about retirement and a bit of retail investing. I wanted to learn everything I could, move what little retirement savings I had into real investment vehicles, and focus on growing wealth to prepare for retirement. 

   For background, I am 30, live in Manhattan, and make about 100k per year.

   This sounds like a lot, but for the city, it is not at all. I pay the highest taxes in the country pretty much, with no write offs to speak of outside of charitable donations. Remember that New York has state AND city income taxes, on top of federal and payroll income taxes. After taxes and pre-tax investments, I took home about $45k last year, literally half of which went straight to rent ($23k). This combined with some of the highest cost of living in the country, one could easily find oneself in a lot of debt just from living normally. Currently, my only debt is student loans from graduate and undergraduate degrees, totaling $39k @ 3.9% interest.

   Yes I choose to live this way, but my compromise was to get serious about retirement, since I do not have a pension to rely on in, even though I consult for the city.

   I learned everything I could about index funds, expense ratios, pre and post tax retirement vehicles, managed vs passive funds, dividends, ROTH IRAs.. Everything. Many of reddit's communities were of help, such as this one and /r/investing . I spent time on Mr Money  Mustache, bogleheads, etc all the big boards which I highly recommend.

   From the year previous, I had about $15k saved up sitting in a 3% fixed interest cash account through my work's 403(B) retirement account.

I moved the cash into low cost index funds that fit my risk portfolio (very high, 95% stock, 5% bonds)

[This is the growth and allocations from 2013 - now]
(https://i.imgur.com/m0FzObA.jpg)

   This includes a Vanguard ROTH IRA that I started about a year and a half ago, which I was able to invest about $9k into and have the dividends reinvested.

   Two tips. Time is the utmost importance. The longer you are invested the better chances you have of living off your investment's interest in retirement. Use Firecalc to figure out how much you need to save to draw the salary needed without touching your principal. If I could go back to when I was 20 and start a ROTH, I would have been able to buy a house already.

   And 2, low expense ratios are key. Using passive, low cost index funds vs active portfolio management is a solid plan and a very good way to make steady gains at a low cost. 

   I can answer any questions anyone has on how to get started, not that I am an expert, but I do have experience on breaking out of the fear of starting and jumping head first to investing smartly.

Edit for those curious: My monthly investments are:

* 403(b) (similar to 401k) : $1200 per month, plus 6% of my yearly salary invested quarterly (employer's 'match') - PRE TAX

* Vanguard ROTH IRA: $110 per week (dollar cost averaging) going into VTSMX and VTTSX POST TAX

VTTSX is a Target Retirement Fund. You input your year of expected retirement and the fund auto-rebalances your holdings based on your portfolio and the time that has passed. 

It really is a set it and forget it type of investment, and at a low cost.

* Retail investments: a few hundred dollars here and there, in high-potential growth companies I trust for the long term (SLTD being my main)
**NOT RECOMMENDED for those new to investing, high potential for losses**

personalfinance,grant was actually a loan?,"Hey there, I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else?  Did you receive a scholarship/grant for college/university and later have to pay it back?

I received a $3k/year ""Hope Scholarship"" from the state of Maryland.  It's for Marylanders who plan on working in Maryland after they graduate.  Although I live in Maryland, I work for the Federal Government in DC.  I've been out of school 3 years and I just received a bill for $12K.

personalfinance,Should I pay off school loans entirely?,"I am 27 years old and I am putting together a financial plan for the first time. I wouldn't say I am awful with money, but I spend more than I should. I currently make about 60k a year and will be receiving a 5% bonus and hopefully a promotion later this year. I am living back at home for at least another few months before moving out solo.

I have about 25k in my savings account, 1.5k in checking and contribute 11% (10% me, 1% my company) to my 401k which is around 5k now. I only have 9k in student loans left at this point as I previously paid off a large chunk.

Should I take a hit to my savings and bring it down to ~ 15k? I don't really know much about student loans to be quite honest. I am nervous about cutting back on my savings, but its probably for the best. How can I tell the amount I would save over that time period? It seems my student loans are a ~ 6-7% interest rate. It says ""unpaid interest"" on one of them is $8.37 when I still have 3k to pay. Total unpaid interest is only about $25... does that really mean I paid the rest of the interest already? I honestly don't understand.

My monthly payment for loans is $172 minimum right now. I will be moving out into an apartment that will be ~800-1000 a month and hopefully getting a new car within the year as well, so that would go towards a car payment which would be nice.

Any thoughts?

Additionally I am thinking I should do something with the remaining 15k if I do pay off the loans. I am guessing it would make sense to leave ~ 5k in there and take 10k to put it into some sort of mutual fund to collect money. Ultimately I am saving for a house, so 50-60k within the next few years total I hope.

I am also budgeting with YNAB and really trying to do everything right so any tips or advice would be AMAZING right now.

So would it affect me in any way if I paid them 10k of the 25k cash, and then they were to use that money to pay off their higher interest credit card first, and then eventually pay off the parent plus loan?

investing,Sell in May and September interest rate cuts,"Over the last 30 years, the 5 months between May and September have performed the worst of any months of the year. With that said, the only one of these months to average negative growth during this time period is September, and this is likely attributable to the 19% drop experienced in that month in 2008. With the analyst consensus for interest rate tightening set as September, the negative returns of September are likely to continue. Historically, it's paid to hold on to your stocks through these months and deal with the lower, yet positive, returns. This year may be different with the impending rate cuts. Do you think that the Fed will cut rates this September?

My opinion is no, due to the weak economic data for March (only 126,000 jobs added, Q1 GDP growth revised down to 0% by the Atlanta Fed) and the dovish character of the Fed chief, Dr. Yellen.

personalfinance,"Student loan debt, time to consolidate?","Hey PF! This will be my second post as a long time lurker and with my last question you guys helped out tremendously, thanks again. Now I'd like to discuss student loans, consolidation and potential options. Here is a quick break down of the student loan dark gloomy cloud of debt that weighs over me:

Navient:

* *Private Unsubsidized* signature student loan $11,157 @ 5.75% 141 payments left
* *Private Unsubsidized* signature student loan $11,794 @ 9.25% (brutal) 141 payments left 

Great Lakes:

* *Unsubsidized* consolidated student loan $15,426.72 @ 6.625% (was two non private loans I consolidated right out of college) 146 payments left

Originally after college I was unable to consolidate all the loans together due to the Navient (Sallie Mae) loans being private unsubsidized loans, while the other two loans I consolidated at the time were just unsubsidized loans through US Department of Education. I have been getting recommendations from CreditKarma.com to consolidate all of my student loans together and receive a lower interest rate on the complete $38,378. That's great and all, but they also want to bring my overall loan length to 180-240 months, not ideal. 

Here are my questions:

1. Can all of the loans be consolidated into a single loan even with Navient loan's being private vs my consolidated loan not being private?

2. Is anyone aware of a reputable student loan consolidation lender that can consolidate these two different types of loans?

3. If I consolidate will I lose my yearly (up to) $2500 tax credit for student loan interest paid in the previous work year?

I am currently making ~$410 in payments monthly and once my CC debt is completely clear I plan on increasing what I am paying towards the student loans. Ideally, I am looking for any recommendations on how I can reduce the interest rates and who I can turn to for consolidation while still being considered a student loan. My credit is north of 760 at this time with no derogatory marks ever, so getting approved is not an issue. 

If anyone has any links to articles, websites, lenders or any useful information it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks again PF for all the knowledge!",finance,1429822934
Bitcoin,How to make war less profitable and reverse the trend of never ending war,"War is profitable. Unnecessary war is an everything or nothing gamble. Either your side wins, and you'll get your money back plus interest and insider access or your side loses and gets nothing. As every gambler knows it is always best to gamble with other people's money, this reduces the risk of you personally going bust and externalizes that risk to someone else. War was one of the first and is still one of the largest investments made by every first world nation every year. The risk of this gamble going bad is passed off from the special interest groups involved in the decision to the general public of a nation under the guise of public good, greater good or necessary evil. Some think 9/11 was because some radicals hate freedom. I think it is much more likely to be blow-back from an overly aggressive constantly escalating state of war and unrest created in the middle east by western special interests that has been made possible and increasingly easier with ever increasing easy money policies for special interests. 

**tl;dr War is an investment made by a small number of special interest, where the risk of the investment is completely passed on to the public. War is escalating because it is becoming easier to fund and less risky for those responsible.**

Bleeding heart patriots will scream about every excuse under the sun, but the bottom line is war exists because it is profitable. It is much more efficient to trade to get what you want than it is to attempt to take it by force, unless of course you didn't foot the bill to begin with and have no personal risk involved.

Investment boils down to two basic variables. The risk of loss and the potential reward. In my honest opinion, we need to make the people who profit from war take on the risk of such investments. Similar to how Bitcoin has realigned the interest of money creators with the money users, I believe we need to realign the risk and reward for war away from society.  

The system currently redistributes risks by allowing a minority to decide how the majority should spend their money. When you see the budget fights during election season remember, that isn't magic money they are arguing about, it's yours. Now I'm not saying we can end the fed tomorrow by electing Rand Paul, but we can get some people into office that want to at least take an interest in the book keeping and maybe do some cut backs. These people might even be against unnecessary war too. Far from a solution, but a step in the right direction. 

**tl;dr They use your currency, to redistribute not only your wealth but the risks of war. A few trade the downside risks of gambling with the public's lives, for the public's money and then those same few pocket the profits. Rinse, and repeat.**

In my opinion the only long term solution to this problem is the separation of money and state. Money like any tool should be a private good and should be subject to the competition and testing of the free market. Only when we rob the state of the power to fund war recklessly will we be able to make those responsible for war take on more of the risks of war. This will not eliminate war from the face of the planet, but it will make it more expensive and thus we may start to reduce war's impact in this world. 

This is not something I believe that can happen from inside the system, because if you are using the system's currency you are fueling it. To separate money from state we are going to have to work outside the system. So although I encourage the continued use of voice and still going to the ballot box to get someone with a conscience into office, I beg every one of you to take some time each month to explore and test alternatives. If you use bitcoins more than you use fiat, then you are empowering Bitcoin and robbing power form the fiat systems. This is because the fiat systems greatest strength is now its greatest weakness. 

The easy money policies that let the few make profit from the blood and savings of the many are only possible with a currency made of nothing but faith. The only thing that makes those neat little pieces of paper and digits in a banks database work is your personal faith in them. Faith has made the world go round for a long time, but something tells me we would all be better off giving math a turn at the wheel. So each time you use bitcoins instead, you rob a little more faith from all those faith based monies. I'm not going to lie, its an incredibly small amount, tiny, most would say it is an insignificant amount and its not enough to affect real change. I have made my peace with that, its true I don't know for certain if it will work, but I now that it *could* and that tiny little sliver of hope, as small and insignificant as it may be to so many, is the brightest and most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I may be in a little personal rowboat trying to fight the fieriest tide on earth and in the end I may only end up where I started but at least I'll be facing the right direction.

**tl;dr The more bitcoins you use, the less faith fiat has to run on. If enough people choose math over faith, we may be able to separate money from state and eliminate unnecessary war.**

I buy and use bitcoins because I am against unnecessary war and support efforts for a more fair distribution of risk and reward in the world.

personalfinance,Need advice on student loans/going back to college,"Hello! Seeking help and advice for my debt.

I'm 19 y/o right now, graduated from high school last May. I went to a state university last fall. I had some financial aid, but ended up with a $5000 bill. I had and have no one at home to ask about loans and financing, and especially no one who could cosign anything, so I put it off till much too late. I was also having trouble with depression, and dealing with class. I had to come home in January since I couldn't pay the bill (not having $5000 on hand) and couldn't register for spring classes.

I am currently working a minimum wage job, living at home, no kids. If I work this job for the next year and pay about half my paycheck every time, I should be able to pay off the $5000 I owe to the university.

I had resigned myself to this, and not being able to go back to school to try and continue my education for a year. Then I thought, maybe I could sign up for a federal student loan, go back in the fall better prepared for the change, and not have to spend a year of my life learning no useful skills, trades, or information, working and living in an environment that does nothing but discourage me from trying to be more than single mother working two jobs to try and support her children. I don't want this life that's been set up, that I see so many of my friends and family falling victim to. I want to be an engineer, and spend my life helping people. I want to go back to school and a supportive, educational environment as soon as I can. I want to try again, with therapy and a better support system and a more realistic idea of what I can do. I want to be able to at least try.

My question, really, is whether or not those of you with experience with this sort of thing think I should try and apply for a federal loan(s). I've been checking on the .gov websites and my university account. My university account says I have about $2500 total available for the Federal Direct Stafford Subsidized/Unsubsidized. Does this mean I should seek loans elsewhere? I'm doing the federal gov Student Loans Entrance Counseling right now, but still having a hard time understanding it. What I really need is advice and help about this whole thing. I haven't completed the FAFSA for this year (since I thought I couldn't go back until I had paid off the debt) but I'll do it in the next couple of days. I'll keep updating and I'll answer any question you have for me.

If the answer to going back is a resounding no, I'll keep up with my personally enforced year-long repayment plan. There is a local community college I could enroll in, but I feel it might be the same type of dampening environment I find at work and at home. I don't really want to go there while trying to work a part-time job, but I'll suck it up and do it if it's the best course of action.

I'm also going to try getting a credit card and buy small purchases on it to build up my credit, but I've seen plenty of good threads on here about that. I do need to check my credit score soon, and I know you can do it at least once a year at one site.

I've tried signing up for mint.com, but the local credit union/bank I use is too small to show up on their lists, so I'm just using a little expense/budget tracker app on my phone.

Thank you so much, anyone and everyone who took the time to read this. While typing it up, I realized more and more how little I know about finances and about debt/loans. There's no one else I can ask. I really just want to go back to school and get my life back on track.",finance,1429823556

personalfinance,Using Federal Subsidized Loans for Roth IRA,"I'm currently a 19 y/o college student with a part time job that provides me with an income of about $500 a month. I have used $1,000 of my income last year to create a Roth IRA account with Vanguard - 2050 Target Retirement. I was wondering if I should take federal direct subsidized loans starting from next year to put into my Roth IRA account and then take the principal amount out of the IRA account when I need to repay the loans post-graduation.

To give some extra background, the U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on a direct subsidized loan if I'm enrolled at least half-time (I will be a full time student for 4 more years). Basically, I don't have to worry about paying off the interest. Also, the maximum direct subsidized loan amount will be $4500 next year and then $5500 every year after that. So, I will receive semiannual loan amounts of $2250 next year and $2750 after next year.

I used the TVM method to calculate how much I can accumulate during the 4 years. Assuming an effective 5% annual gain (semiannual gain of about 2.47%) and receiving loan amounts at the beginning of each period, I calculated my net gain to be about $2390.18 at the end of the 4 year period and when I have to pay off the loan.

Math (Time Value of Money):
http://imgur.com/aHmea2u

Is this something that I should consider doing, or is it a waste of my time? Are there any cons that I should be wary of?

edit: I suck at saying what I want to say. I'm trying to justify taking out a direct subsidized loan vs. not taking it out. If I were to get the loan, the loan money would obviously be going towards my education. My current income would then go into a Roth IRA account, and then after the end of the 4 years, I will pull all the income that I earned and repay the loan. Also, I forgot to include the 1% origination fee.

edit 2: I don't think people are understanding where I am coming from. I'm going to be spending the loan on my education (tuition, books, rent) and putting the same amount that I'm loaning (from my income) into a Roth IRA so that I can repay the loan amount after 4 years AND hopefully earn some more money. I'm asking this because I don't know whether or not to just pay off the loan as I earn money, or just store it temporarily into a Roth IRA and pay it when the loan is actually due.",finance,1429824261
personalfinance,Need some help with setting myself up for the future,"Hey all,

I made a post yesterday afternoon and got only a single response, the advice was good but am looking for some more input. So here is my situation:

I will be graduating College in a month and am trying to keep setting my self up for financial success. Last summer I got my first credit card which was one of the secure plus cards with a $500 limit, I pay the card of every month and have never missed a payment. I requested a credit limit raise and to unsecure it. At first it was denied due to me not having a stable income but after 2 days was accepted and as of then have a 794 credit score. I plan to ask for credit limit raises every six months. Lastly this card is through my local credit union.

Since I will be graduating I will have loans the amount is around $80,000 all through parent plus loans so they are Federally backed and repayment will begin in October since I graduate in May. They payments for this will be around $1,200/month for 10 years.

The kicker is that I have a decent summer job that I will be working until the middle of August and make $15.00 and hour and can pretty much work as many hours as I want between 35-60 with lunch/dinner provided since it is a kitchen job. Then in August I will ship off for Army basic for 6-7 months since I joined the Army since the incentives were decent and it is something I have wanted to do. I am getting a $20,000 student loan repayment plan which repays a year after joining (april,2016) and will pay 15% of my total loan every year until it is exhausted, I estimated 16-22 months of me not having to pay. I plan to become a law enforcement officer in my area which starts out at $44,xxx a year with full benefits which isn't a big deal since I am fully insured with government insurance till I'm 26 if I recall. (Please no cop hate or political arguments over this.)

Some more background info:

* I will be living at home rent free for however long I want

* I do not pay phone, car, or insurance. My parents take care of this

* My only food expenses is whatever I feel like making or going out to get since my mom or dad make dinner almost every night.

My questions:
I will estimate that I will make $10-14,000 this summer working my summer job since I made $11,000 last summer making $12.50 an hour and $2,100 a month while at army basic with minimal expenses so that is about $12,000 estimated. (this is all pre-tax and my state doesn't have income tax so it is just federal)

* Should I put this money into a savings account so I have an emergency fund or throw everything I can at my students loan to pay them off as quick as possible?

* Should I apply for income based repayment since it will most likely be way below the $1,200 monthly payments and just drag them out for 10 years since the job I will be doing after getting home from basic will have the 10 years of payment and forgiveness deal since it will be a civil servant job.

* Would putting the maximum I'm allowed towards a Thrifts savings plan be better than putting what I earn into my savings?

If anyone has any other advice or questions feel free to contribute. I personally feel that I have a solid foundation but others will be able to tell me otherwise if I am incorrect. I am honestly looking for guidance since I have not had much financial guidance in the past and honestly don't want to be stuck with these student loans for the rest of my life.

Tl;DR I am looking for advice on if I should start retirement, an emergency funds or attack my student loans after graduation. Reading will help understand the situation.",finance,1429824418

My biggest issue that I'm running into right now is trying to figure out how much the various life expenses are going to cost. I know that I'll be living in the Carlsbad area, but it's difficult to get quotes on things like insurance without an address.

Car payments: &lt;$12,000 for my fiancee (her parents bought her a car last year, and we'll be taking over the payments after we get married - they haven't told me how much is left on the payments yet)

I know I need to budget for the following:

Fuel: ~$500 (I know that's way high, but I'd rather over-budget)

Food: $300

Rent: $1,500

Utilities (Water, Sewer, Garbage, Electricity, Gas): $???

Car insurance: $???

Health Insurance (Federal): $???

Dental Insurance (Federal): $???

Internet: $50

Phones: $150

I'm also looking at purchasing a vehicle, because my current one is really getting old. Right now I'm looking at a new Jeep Patriot for around $18,000 because I need 4WD for work, and it's the cheapest new SUV on the market. If I wasn't moving away I'd be fine with going used because I know mechanics, but a new vehicle is more likely to be reliable and be covered by the warranty.

personalfinance,Any good alternatives to Santander?,"I have an extra20 checking and savings account at Santander.  It pays me $20 a month.  I don't actually use the savings account - I keep $1 in.  My primary bank is Ally, but I get my paychecks direct deposited to Santander so that I can get the $20 each month.

I absolutely hate this bank with a passion.  I hate their website, I hate their customer service, I hate literally everything about it besides the free $20 each month.  For example, they have awful customer service hours, there's no online chat help, their email customer service is useless, you can't do online transfers to other banks from their website, and as someone who mainly banks online this drives me nuts.  I've also overdrafted a few times because if I use bill pay and it sends it as a check instead of via online payment it doesn't automatically deduct the amount from my available balance until the check gets cashed, which I didn't notice at first.  In addition, the customer service people are seriously the rudest people I've ever spoken to in my life, unless I just have really bad luck when I've called.

So after a few overdrafts and being annoyed to death with the customer service, I told myself I'd close this account, but then I can't bring myself to because I realize that the $20 bonuses cancelled out the overdraft fees anyway and where else am I gonna get interest like that?

At some point I'm gonna get fed up and close it - the $240 probably isn't worth the annoyance this bank causes me - but are there any good competitive alternatives?  I love Ally but they aren't paying me $240 for having direct deposit.

* Savings: 8k
* Income: 125k
* 401k / Roth: None
* 401k Max Match: $1,250 (125k x 4% contribution x 25%)
* Gov Student Loan (@7% Fixed): 80k

I'm planning on refinancing with a private lender @ at 2-3% vari. with a 10 - 15 year term.  Then I would use 100% of all extra income to pay down the loan. This would reduce the crushing interest rate, but not lock me into an overwhelming payment. 

Once I finish, then I would start contributing/setting up my 401k / Roth accounts.  401k match seems too low to pursue.

**Questions:**

 * This is obviously a long term strategy; is this my best plan of attack? I would hate to get 2 years down the road and feel dumb because I missed something.

 * Other than claiming the max $2,500 interest paid credit.. is there another way I could help my tax situation while paying this down?",finance,1429830798
personalfinance,Am I understanding this correctly in paying ahead on student loans (Great Lakes)?,"I have Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans with Great Lakes and no interest accrued yet on my 10K loan. I have been deferring it for about 1.5 years since graduating and it's over next month. So I found this on Greatlakes.org.

Paying an extra amount or making additional payments may result in your loan being prepaid or paid ahead. During this time, it means:

•You won't be considered past due if you were to stop making payments or paid less than your regular payment amount, but only until you're no longer paid ahead.

•If you're signed up for Auto Pay, automatic payments will continue being made.

•Interest continues to accrue.

•It's best to continue making payments in order to stay on top of the accruing interest and prevent any loans from becoming past due (delinquent).

How about in deferment? If I were to knock down 5G's on my 10K loan, I won't be on the hook for monthly payments until the loan has ""caught up?""

Bitcoin,Review of BTC Jam.,"I had recently signed up for the service BTCJam. Here is my review…


The signup process was relatively simple. I opened the account back in August but never really finished the verification process until a couple of weeks ago. They ask for things such as your income, (paystubs) Picture ID, as well as proof of banking. The idea is to get as fully verified as possible. You can choose to not verify fully (as I have seen many account that do) but it can hurt your overall rating. 

BTC Jam uses a grade average rating scale to rate the investors and loan”ees?”. When I first opened my account I was an E. I verified all my information and I became a C. People are much more interested in investing in you if you have a better rating (A being highest, down to B, C, D, and lastly E ((why no F??)).

To give a simple explanation as to what BTC Jam is I have this:

BTC Jam is an online community that allows investors and borrowers alike build a trustworthy personal profile and loan monies or invest in other people’s ideas/concepts. But why would someone want to invest? It’s simple, much like a tradition loan you would receive at the bank BTCJam also gives borrowers an interest rate based on their profiles credit worthiness, credit worthiness is not decided by a traditional credit rating bureau but the investors themselves.  So for example I want to invest in someone’s loan that has a C profile. I would choose the amount I wish to invest and then receive payments (3-months, weekly, 6-months-monthly) as the loan describes. Sooo… In simple terms.. I wish to invest 0.1 BTC in someones loan. I would then get that 0.1 BTC back once the loan was payed in full plus any interest. 

I would suggest investors diversify their monies across many different profiles, as tempting as it can be to throw your entire loot at someone , DON’T! Put a few bucks towards higher rated loans and a few towards lower rated loans. The lower the rating, the more risky the borrower is to default but this also has the benefit of giving you a higher return. 

As far as borrowers, this is my experience:

Like said after completing my profile and getting all my information manually reviewed (which actually took less than 24v hours after I had finally submitted my information) I was able to start a loan listing. I chose to invest in an Antminer for personal mining. I set my price at 1.6BTC and watched the listing. Originally the loan had to be manually reviewed before being published but people were still able to see the loan even before it went live. I was a tad impatient waiting for the loan to go live (which actually didn’t until Monday and I listed on a Friday). But, it paid off. I was able to speak to a few of the veteran investors and get my name out there. I was asked a lot of interesting questions and was very up-front an honest with anyone who asked me anything, I figured being as transparent as possible was key. Within a few hours of the listing going live I started to receive investments. some as small as .00001 and some as large as 0.1 BTC. All in all I had a total of around 50 different investors. It only took around 3-4 days for my loan to be 100% funded and I noticed as more and more people gave and my loan became more and more fulfilled there were more and more people interested. Day one my loan hit 20% and day two, maybe an additional 20%, but by day 3 it went up 60% within a few hours and I was fully funded. 

I then activated the loan and transferred the money out of my BTCjam account and into my wallet. Before you transfer out you are charged a fee (this is how BTCJam makes their commission). I then went and purchased the Antminer and reassured the investors I had used the money for exactly what I said I would. (I showed a screenshot of my receipt to them via reddit).

Overall I had a very good experience with BTCJam and believe I will use them again. The more I do – the more trust I will receive and the higher my trust – the lower the interest rate will be. I can also assume the higher rating I have the faster the funding will be and the more I can ask for and be trusted with.


So anyone looking to borrow or invest in the BTCJam community I would give you this advice:

•	Be as transparent as possible, if you have a fault in your listing don’t be afraid to admit it and chalk it up as a learning experience.

•	When someone invests, follow them and invest back into their profiles, this is common courtesy and I feel it will help build a good reputation with that individual and they will not hesitate to invest in you next time. 

•	And lastly, use the money for what you promised you would use it for and provide proof of your purchase or investments to the investors. Like I said the more transparent you are – the more personable the investor may feel and they will build a relationship with you and your listing and be more inclined to invest again.

I will be posting more reviews on other P2P lending services as time goes on (Like bitlendingclub and Stemfund) I was going to post a link to my listing in order to show how exactly I did it, but I didn’t want to spam this post with my own listings as that is not the purpose of this review. If you wish to ask any questions please feel free to comment or PM me.

personalfinance,"I filed my tax rebate, but the IRS wants more information and that has left me a little confused.","Hello,
Sorry to bother you with a tax related question that I hope is not out of line. I am new to doing taxes and especially new to American taxes.

Last year, I worked for a few months in the US (internship) and my employer withheld my taxes. I am, however, owed a rebate (something about withholding for a year when I worked for less than that), so I filled for it with a 1040NR-EZ. 

The IRS sent me a letter claiming that to support the amount of withholding I requested, I need to submit:

* W-2
* Form 1042-S: Foreign Person's US Source Income subject to Withholding.
* Form 8805: Foreign Partner's Information Statement of Section 1446
* Form 8288: Statement of Withholding on Dispositions by Foreign Person's of US Real Property Interests  


I thought I had submitted my W2, *but* I may have dun goofed and forgotten to do so. I don't mind (re)sending it, but it is the other forms that worry me a little since none of my friends who did the same kind of work as me had to do them. 


I don't have a partner or real property, so I don't think I need to fill out the 8805 and 8288. I am honestly not sure what the 1042-S is for, but I guess one would need it for reporting income from dividends and stuff? If that is the case, then I shouldn't need it.


Assuming I don't actually need any of those forms (please do let me know if you think I need them), is it enough to just send the W-2? Or do I need to send a letter with it telling them I don't need those other forms? Or do I need to send out half filled versions of those forms?

Not withstanding currency fluctuations, we really got into it about safety of fiat money in the bank.  AFAIK, bank FDIC insurance only covers up to $100k losses if the bank goes bankrupt in the traditional sense.  Not, if someone hacks your mobile or online access and wires or sends the money somewhere else.  I also brought up the possibility of bail-ins where the government confiscates savings, but because he lives in the USA he wrote it off as a non-event that would never happen despite my Cyprus example.  And we also discussed a run on banks and fractional reserves which he basically wrote off as a non-issue in the USA too.  I guess he's right to some extent outside of inflation, that the Fed window can just widen to the point that the Fed takes on all the leverage from the banks to recapitalize them properly.  But still, this was a very frustrating conversation.


To be fair, he had one good argument.  He said if the bank loses his money, he feels that it's their fault and he can go sue them, but if he loses bitcoin, that would be on him.

personalfinance,Emergency fund for university startup,"Hi /r/personalfinance ,

I have been enjoying follow this subreddit for a few months and it has encouraged me to make a budget and start saving.
I am currently pondering whether to use my emergency fund (still saving up) for when I start university.
Now, the reason I ask is because I am not sure what else to use it for and saving up for both emergency fund and university is going to be very hard. I will attend the university summer 2016. 

It is important to note that in my country you actually receive a small sum each month for studying - about 720 dollars after taxes. 
Furthermore, I think of applying for a student loan. In my country it means receiving 438 USD each month. The interest rate is 4 % while you study and 1 % after you finish studying (have to start paying back 1 year after graduation).

If I start to save aggressively I can save 1,150 dollars each month. This could go to emergency fund and/or university startup account. 

Basically, what is more important and can I even justify NOT using my emergency fund as financial back-up when I start university.

personalfinance,Sallie Mae/Navient in-school deferment has expired? I didn't think this was possible and need sound advice.,"Hi, thanks to everyone who reads this. I don't think my story is atypical, and I hope this thread can help others (as well as myself).

I went to private college--Duquesne University--in 2006 and graduated in 2011 (I took a year off in between). Being naive (and middle-class) I took out private loans from Sallie Mae to pay for college that are now at around 35,000 (I have significantly more federal loan debt). I took these private loans out with the understanding that an in-school deferment lasts indefinitely. I graduated with a degree in Psychology, and, not having many prospects, decided to go for an MA, which cost me about 10,000 more in federal loans. Wanting to go further, I am currently a PhD student (2nd year). When I graduate, I will likely have a good enough job to pay this shit back. But, part of my story is really being pushed into further school by a.) original student loads and b.) a bad job market (Ironic? Absolutely.) Recently, I was told by Sallie Mae (now Navient) that my in-school deferment has expired. I though this was impossible, but apparently their loans have a cap on in-school deferment of 48 months. This is in addition to the ""in-school"" status of the loan that lasts 4 years of college (so 8 years total). This blindsided me, and now I'm scrambling to figure out what to do. Thus, I have a few questions: 

Will consolidation or anything like that help? Can I transfer it to another company? 
I see ads (online, via mail, etc.) for random companies that help with consolidation and payback. Would any of these help? 

Another option is to a.) pay interest only until I get out of school or b.) extend the repayment plan to 24 years. They both result in the same loan payment per month. There seems to be no downside to the latter; it just seems to offer some flexibility, and after I graduate I will pay them back much sooner than 24 years. Is there a catch to this?

-paid off lots of debt in collections
-got a secured cc and have made every payment on time
- kept my usage percentage down (until recently, but it will be back down after this payment)
-brought my score up almost 200 points

I am now getting mail to get an auto loan from certain places- Capital One being one- so I am assuming I am on the right track. (No car payments, 2012 Sonata so that isn't going to happen)

What can I do to get my credit over this little bump? If it's just going to take time, I am cool with that. Right now, my on time payment average is about 69% and I know that is horrible, but it will take a long time to get that back to the right side of the spectrum.

personalfinance,Auto Loan Help,"Hello,
I am looking for some advice, as far as obtaining a car loan, my brother suggested I come here.
Here is my situation...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
21 years old

No credit history other than approx 5 hard inquiries over the last year.

Monthly Income of approx $1550 (approx 19k net annual) operating a family business 

No debt to my name (Credit cards, student loans, anything)

Only monthly bills I have is insurance (60$ currently) and A cellphone (40$) still living with mom and dad.

Have been employed at the family business for 5 years (3 years on record)

Will have approx 3k for down payment

Looking to get loan for approx 5-6K

Co signer is not an option, mom has cancer, so parents have a mountain of medical debt from the last 2 years
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have attempted to get an auto loan in the past to the amount of 10k (I now know that is way over what I can realistically expect to get) and needed a co signer, I was pre-approved at a dealership, but overestimated my annual income on the application, and ended up needing a co signer to get the vehicle (lets just say, I settled for a truck that cost as much as my down payment).

I am somewhat confident, that with my down payment, that I can get approved though a dealer again, but am worried with costs and risks associated with that (the terms seemed pretty good for a no credit applicant, I thought, 10K loan, 52 months, at 8% interest but we never got to fees or anything, once my taxes came out, I was rejected.)

I guess my question is, what are my options as far as an auto loan goes? Also, what are the risks involved with dealer financing?
I know to expect high interest rates, and that I will end up paying a lot more for the vehicle, but if I can make it work, even with 10% interest, is it worth it?

Also, I can't afford anymore 'limp along' cars, my family has been surviving on those for years now
(Somewhere in the neighborhood of 6000$ in repairs in the last 6 months)

Other credit info: Applied for a credit card approx a month ago through wells fargo (500$ limit, their lowest monthly limit) and was rejected on my own, and with my older brother as a Co Signer (He has Approx 720 credit score)

Any advice will be helpful, I cant afford another vehicle breakdown",finance,1429909977

**Occupation**: self employed tech/consulting

**Objectives**: Financial literacy and 20 year plan for income. 

**Risk Tolerance:** Willing to take risks on technology. No fuel speculation

**Current Holdings**: None, $100,000 in checking account.

**Assets**: $2000 beater car, 42mpg. No home, properties etc.

**Time**: 5 year goal for apartment  or home ownership. Build up assets over time so that when I reach my 40s I can live off investments. 

**Debt**: No debts. No student loans. 2 credit cards with auto bill pay to try to build up credit.

**Other**: I live in a super expensive city, similar to the Bay Area, Honolulu or NYC. My current rent is a super cheap $450/mo, which is less than most condo's maintenance fees so if I were to invest into real estate, i would be spending so much more than my current. Cheapest places are in the $350k-400k range for 1 and 2 bedrooms.  No family support/property etc.

I'm looking for were to best get started in investing $100,000 cash, diversified into 3-4 things, but without me having to spend months learning a new skill. I have a separate 6 months savings backup.

Long time lurker, first time poster. Have read some amazing advice in here, and the time has come to get some help myself!

I'm 26 years old and just got a job at a UC (University of California) Hospital. This is not my career, as I'm studying for medical school. The position is part-time and the pay is decent. Main purpose of the job is gain clinical experience and to cover some costs while in school. 

I have almost no knowledge on retirement plans, investing, 401Ks, etc. I hope you all will be a bit patient with me lack of knowledge!

I received a letter in the mail stating that I have been automatically enrolled in a ""Defined Contribution (DC) Plan"".The DC Plan automatically deducts 7.5% from my wages each period and directs them to a DC Plan account at Fidelity Retirement Services. 

The letter states, ""Your contributions will be automatically invested in the Plan's default option, the UC Pathway Fund that most closely matches the year you turn age 65. You can change your investment designation at any time.""

My questions:
1) First and foremost, is a Retirement Savings Plan something I should considering even though this is not my career and it's a part-time job?
     1a) If so, would this retirement plan carry over when I eventually reach my career? 
2) Am I taxed (Federal and State) on the income before or after the 7.5% deduction?
3) The letter states that I could increase the savings by also contributing to the 403(b) and 457(a) plans. There is no other information regarding these plans, and several internet searches have got me stumped. Should I consider these two plans? What are the pros and cons?

I'm looking to pay it off within a year from now. But once I graduate, I will also owe around $30,000 in student loans and I owe $4000 in federal taxes from last year. That's all the debt I have.
I got the Leaf because it was lightly used and after it's paid of, I'll have a car that I can drive around town for very cheap. My daily commute is usually no more than 20 miles total. My monthly payment on the car is $300 right now and I pitch in extra to pay it off faster. Once I get a more stable job, I want to pay it off with a lump sum.

investing,P2P lending; high risk high returns,"I invested $500 in extra cash in 2009 via Prosper, and I've made really good returns on that investment. My seasoned annual rate of return is 16.95%. Really amazing returns, I'm floored.

Part of my success was diversification. My rules were 
1) only lend $50-100 max per loan 
2) only lend to borrowers asking for $2000 or less
3) only lend to borrowers who filled out every loan question on the survey
4) borrower must be employed
5) only invest in loans that have an interest rate higher than 25%

In the past two years, Prosper has made a lot of these requirements impossible. There are no loans that meet these requirements anymore, specifically #3 as they don't have borrowers fill out the questionnaire anymore. Loans are all for amounts over $10,000. Highest interest rates I can find are in the higher teens.

I read this Forbes article about the decline of P2P lending http://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2014/10/14/the-disappearance-of-peer-to-peer-lending/

personalfinance,Trying to ease my parents into investing for growth instead of maintenance (or loss in this case),"My parents are double retired (retired from the Marine Corps and the Postal Service) and unemployed due to a layoff and a lousy local job market. They are debt free, including not having a mortgage but they want to get a little more money from their investments than they currently do but are apprehensive. 

My mother is preparing to sell her share of interest in a piece of land that she inherited a couple of years ago and I suggested that they invest that money and grow it instead of just sticking it in savings or, as they have done in the past, a CD. She will get about $5,000 for her share.

My father is weary of going to an investment broker because he doesn't trust them. I've told him to go through the bank that handles his IRA or to open an account himself with Vanguard. I showed him some of the funds available to choose from and he seemed interested in the growth percentages (as he is used to getting .99% from CDs at the bank, which is a recipe for loss given interest rate vs inflation).

Can anyone recommend a relatively safe mutual fund with decently high average returns with Vanguard or elsewhere that I can advise him to invest all or part of this money in for about a year just to sort of ease them into the concept of investing in something that will actually grow their money. Hopefully after they see what their money can do for them, this will inspire them to seek out an actual financial adviser that can help their money start earning for them.

personalfinance,Can I negotiate the price of my car with financing and then just pay off the entire loan the next day?,"Ok so long story short, there is a car I want and the saleman flatly said ""I can probably get you the price you want if you finance it through us."" which is sales speak for ""I'll get you on the interest rate.""

I told him I didn't want to discuss financing I wanted to discuss final price of the vehicle, he then changed his attitude and became difficult and said the price I wanted was too low and they couldn't possibly do that.

So here is my question, can I just go back let them finance me at whatever % they want and then pay off the loan immediately? I have enough money in the bank to pay cash for the car but that would leave me cash poor so I was thinking maybe I'd take a reasonable rate loan from my bank (or maybe even ask them if I can refinance the car through them?) and pay off the dealership loan in full before it accrues any interest.

personalfinance,(25) Advise for current financial situation?,"I posted this in /r/investing and figured I should post it here as well. 

I am 25, currently employed making roughly 31k a year. 
In terms of checking/savings, I have about 2100$ currently split between my checking/savings account (with Wells Fargo, student checking/Way2Save savings). 
My employer offers a 401k (with John Hancock). My employer matches 3% of contributions, so my contribution is 3% each pay check.
Recently to get my 'feet wet', I have started investing in smaller stocks with a friend. I own 10 shares in MRGE and 300 shares is SGMNF. 

In terms of expenses a month; I pay roughly 350$ a month for my car, about 150$ in credit cards, 120$ in insurance, and roughly 100$ in misc expenses. Starting June, I will have to start paying my student loans which I do not know the exact terms for yet. It will be roughly around 13k in student loans. 
I should have my credit cards paid off by then, and my car paid off by this time next year. If possible, my goal is to pay 500$ a month on student loans, maybe more. 


With all that being said, I want to make sure I start budgeting, saving, and making the most of my investments for long term financial success. All in all, if everything goes my way, I will be completely debt free in roughly a 2 year time frame. I know it is impossible to become so financially stable over night, but my overall goal is to have at least 3 times more than what I currently have in hand now by the end of the year, and at least 3 times more than that at the end of my time frame to be debt free. 
That being said, I know there is no ""best"" bank to enroll with, but any advice on financial institutions out there that may be worth moving to? My biggest concern to start is that my accounts are really that of a college student. I am not a fan of the Way2Save savings deducting random amounts every so often into my savings. For something like that, I'd sign up for digit.co. I want a decent interest rate (I know the average is around 1%) on my savings account. No crazy minimum for my checking. I want my funds to be with an institution that is secure and doesn't have many issues with fraud. I have had 2 issues arise with fraud/fraudulent charges in about 6 years with Wells Fargo that were resolved immediately. I would like to possibly start the research process of opening up a CD during the next 2 years while I am in the process of clearing out my debt. I know the 401k/IRA is the way to go, and if I ever leave my employer I will roll my 401k over to an IRA to my brokerage (Fidelity). However, I definitely want some kind of savings accrual during the next couple of years that I don't have to think about it and that will become the glorious 20$ in the back pocket of those jeans you just put on for the first time since before skinny jeans were a thing. If possible, I would definitely love for all of that to be part of the same financial institution. Whether sticking to Wells Fargo or going else where, any advice on checking/savings accounts, CD's, etc would be greatly appreciated. 

I know the small stocks for a first timer may have not been the brightest idea, but it was under 100$. On top of that if I make money, it's a plus. If I don't, I am only out 100$ that could be part of misc expenses for a month. 

A little more to add. I got a friend hired at my employer, my employer has a 1000$ referral bonus I will be getting roughy same time as my tax return. My tax return is roughly 2800$ (if I remember correctly). A majority of that is going to my credit cards. The remainder for some minor car repairs (new tires, oil change, etc).

solar,Is The Solar Boom in California About to go Bust?,"More details regarding [AB 327](http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/DistGen/NEMWorkShop04232014.htm) are emerging and it looks like solar in California will be significantly more expensive starting July 1, 2017. Right now the state run utilities have a tiered pricing system, where the top tier is about 250% higher than the bottom tier. Based on what I'm seeing in the news, AB 327 will lower this differential from 250% to 20%.  This could be very bad for solar for a couple of reasons:

1) Right not there is a huge financial incentive for heavy residential users of electricity to invest in solar. Due to the tiered rates, it doesn't take much to get electricity bills that average $300+ per month. These homes are prime candidates for solar and are heavily marketed to by solar companies (I get calls almost every day).  Anyone that owns a house in this category either has solar now, or is seriously considering it.  If the tiers go away, these homes could see their electric bills cut by over 50%, which takes away most of the incentive to invest $25,000+ in solar.

2) Once you have solar installed, the tiered rate system benefits the solar owner tremendously. This is because the utilities credit solar owners at the full retail price of electricity during peak hours. This means during the day in the middle of summer when my solar is generating excess electricity, I'm being credited at a $0.32/kwh, which is enough to zero out most of my electric bill for the entire year since at night and during the winter months, I'm only paying about $0.13/kwh.  If that price differential is lowered from 250% to 20%, and the bottom tier price is increased to make up for lowering top tiers, I will end up with a large electricity bill at the end of the year.  Based on my usage for last year, I estimate this to be somewhere around $800-$1,200 per year. Considering that my loan payment for solar is $2,200/year, this is a net increase of about 40%-50% for the annual cost of solar, in my situation. I have heard that existing solar users will be grandfathered in, but I haven't seen details on this yet, and somehow I suspect existing solar users will end up getting screwed as well.

Also, add on top of all this that the federal tax credit may be going away, or significantly reduced.  This could increase cost of solar by another 30%.

Add it all up, and it seems like the cost of solar in California is on track to more than double in the next two years. However, it won't take that long for us to start seeing the impact of these changes. As word gets out that the top rate tiers are going away, it's going to be much more difficult to convince people that solar is justified.",energy,1429976595

April 2015.  Storms hit central Texas and a tree blows over.  Cost to remove $600 and tree companies suggest removing all trees in backyard because they're aging and might fall on the house.  Total cost to do so $4k.

Not all of it is a complete loss because it increases my quality of life (I can poop with a peaceful mind now) and the value of my home is improved slightly but so much of it is a waste.  Don't think of homes as a way to make money. Think of it as a way to build a nest and get over the concept of it being an investment.  

Good news- property value in my neighborhood has gone up 10% since I bought and doesn't look like it's stopping.  All my neighbors are either young hip couples in their early 30s or retired people so massive turnover will happen in the next decade. 

TL;DR- Pay everyone (plumber, arborist, roofer, electrician, plus regular inspector guy) to inspect your house on every possible level before you buy it, get every penny off the price that you can, and don't expect your house to make you money because the first year or two will just be a money pit.

personalfinance,"Student Loans setup to prevent me from paying faster. Other millennials stuck w/ ""Navient""?","Hello! I've had my student loans on auto-pilot for years, auto-deducting the minimum of $265 from my bank account each month. I've just gotten a new job, and I'm ready to hit them harder and pay at least $500/mo towards my balance of ~$20,000 spread across 10 federal loans I took out throughout my undergraduate degree.

Last year, Sallie Mae transferred my loans to ""Navient"", and the tools for managing my loans are a joke. If I pay extra on top of my regular auto-deduction, I noticed they moved my next auto-deduction date back to keep me ""on schedule"" for my 10 year plan. They're also automatically allocating ""on my behalf"" how to split my payment amongst the 10 loans which each have different interest rates and balances.

The customer service rep said if I'd like to choose how to allocate my payment or pay more than the auto-deduct rate, I can stop paying online, and pay by check each month with a hand written letter detailing how much of my payment is to go to each loans' account number. This all just seems ridiculous.

They're clearly gaming me by making it difficult to pay faster or smarter by limiting the tools available on their website, setting up hoops to jump through. The rates are quite low, and I'm not sure I can consolidate into a better rate, but I'm generally just irritated at the game. Any advice on how to kill these things?

Bitcoin,The true power of Bitcoin: Harnessing your economic energy.,"To me Bitcoin's killer app is the ability to have the most powerful financial representation on the planet.  It's about an honest day's work being rewarded and converted into the most dynamic yet honest form of money we've ever seen.  It's about unleashing your economic potential and expression in a way that cannot be manipulated and distorted.  

Currently the financial elite laugh at an honest day's work because they have eroded any purchasing power that your wage claims it represents. Every year your wages are worth less yet corporations treat those wages the same regarding your compensation and will hold over your head the fact that they are giving you a ""raise"", if they even give one.  Even then you are still coming out behind. It takes so much fiat currency now in order to have the purchasing power needed to compete with the trillions of fiat dollars that are sloshing around.

They laugh because they can chop up their fiat currency 50 different ways like a magician performing a three cup shuffle trick and make more of it through Wall Street and the federal reserve system.  They laugh because money dictates your world but it enables theirs. They laugh because the only way to fund your life is through debt, which in turn backs their currency.  See it's a lose lose situation for the everyday person, the house always wins in the current system. 

Bitcoin for the first time shatters this mold and renders it obsolete.  Its the most enabling technology on the planet.   It's about freedom of financial expression, representation and inclusion.  To me that is the killer app.",cryptocurrency,1429992432
personalfinance,I Need Help Choosing A Student Loan Repayment Plan (High Debt),"I graduated in May 2013 with a BS in Engineering and immediately started an MS in Engineering and graduated in December of 2014. Between both degrees I racked up ~$65,000 worth of debt and with interest it's currently at $69,201, ALL in Direct Fed loans. My interest rate is 5.6% averaged out. Since my grace period will soon be coming to an end I decided I should consolidate and pick a good payment plan.


I got a job in September 2014 while finishing up my last semester in school making $60,000/year salary. After taxes and semi-heavy 401k contributions I make ~$1600 every 2 weeks so my AGI is $42,000.


My standard repayment plan of 120 equal payments is $756/month which is a bit high. I was initially looking at doing the Extended Fixed Plan which is 300 equal payments of $431/month (with $0 in foregiveness). But now I'm seeing the Pay As You Earn Plan which is 240 payments ranging between $167 to $544/month and I have the opportunity to have $45,379 forgiven after I complete 240 payments (20 years).


I'm also under the impression that I will be taxed on all forgiven debt which is approx $11,000. Would there be any other consequences such as a bad credit hit for using this program?


1) What is the qualification for 'Financial Hardship' and would I qualify? 

2) I'm getting married in the next 2 years, would I modify this to add in my future wife's loans and income or would I continue to make the same payments?

3) What proof of income would they require while setting this up? My AGI was a lot lower last year which is on my taxes because I only had a job part of the year.

4) Would I consolidate them all into one first then pick my repayment plan?

5) I have 1.5 months left until my grace period ends, will consolidation end this grace period early?

personalfinance,I need a car for college what is the best way to go about this?,"I'm in my first year of community college, age 18. One campus is 10 minutes from my house but the other is 30 minutes away so I end up having to wait around for the college shuttle bus that runs between the campuses every 2 hours which is a HUGE waste of time. Also I just got a job and have to go to physical therapy for a few months from a running injury (can still drive fine) so I would like to have my own vehicle and not rely on my parent's driving me.

Right now I have a loan through the school for 5k a semester and if I am only there for 2 years (might be 3) it will total just under 10k again a federal loan from the school. The university I plan on transferring to is 20k per semester (another 2 years there) but I can almost cut that in half if I don't dorm and it's 30 minutes away so a car is ideal. That loan will probably be half from the bank and half from the school but I might also get some aid and scholarships. 

Right now I just started working a part time job but I think I'm going to be getting at least 20+ hours a week in the summer at 9.75 plus bonuses (we sell a lot so bonuses are quite frequent). I currently have nothing saved up as this is basically my first job. 

My question is what is the best way to go about this. My buddy financed a car that is 10k from a dealer with a loan through his bank and makes a $150 payment every month. I could do that but I wont get a car that expensive as I would be stuck paying for it for a long time. Also I am going to need a bank loan for college so getting one for a car might bite me in the ass if I end up needing more than I think I do for tuition. The plus side is my credit is pretty good (got a Capitol One card last year and have almost a 700 credit score) Another concern of this is what if my current job doesnt work out and I get stuck with the payments. I don't see this happening as they are asking me to do more hours and they seem to like me but no job is 100% guaranteed and without a savings I would be fucked 

Second option is to save up a few grand and buy used but I truly don't want to do that and prefer going through a dealer because I have had quite a few friends do this and spend double on repairs. I was also planning to put 80% of my paycheck into savings and if I did this I would have to put the whole paycheck away and than have nothing for a while after I purchase the car. With the financing I could afford payments, gas, and savings deposit. 

The good thing is besides the car I really have nothing else to pay for. I wont start paying the loans until after I graduate, my parents support me at home, and my books are covered in the loan so honestly the only things I have in mind money wise is a car, savings, and MAYBE a camera to do some photography side work (my buddy is a DJ we might link up together for some events) but that is a secondary thing not sure if it would be worth the investment, also would need a car anyway for that.

personalfinance,"Partner and I (20M and 22M) moving in together, looking for input.","Sorry if this is long - please skip to the bottom financial overview if you are not interested in the history behind it.

My partner and I (M20 and M22) are moving into an apartment next week. Just wanted to check with everyone here to describe out financial situation and see if we are doing the smartest thing we can.

The move is necessary - he is no longer welcome with his family, and my parents are going through a divorce. He's been staying with a friend and paying them rent for a while, but it was always a short-term deal. Both of our current living situations are very stressful, and we're under a lot of pressure so our own space would be very productive and healthy for us.

I have been living with my parents for the past year and a half. I had gone to college for a year, had plenty of AP credit from high school, and was doing well, not working at all, and took out a 5K subsidized federal loan for school for that year. The rest was paid for. Then, I had some personal things happen and had to take a break from school for a while (LDS mission for 5 months, subsequently left the church) and started working fulltime after that, $12/hour.

I have had numerous raises and started going back to school since then. I now make $16/hr and go to school fulltime (12 hrs of classes). I'm on track to graduate May 2017. I have a 2013 car that I just finished paying off with my partner's help (Paid remaining balance of $5130 on a $14K original loan. It was a 6 year loan at 13.7% interest. Yikes! But I paid well above the minimum every month and only ended up paying around $900 in interest. We have agreed that I will pay him back as much as possible every month, no pressure or set amount. I want to do at least $300 a month. I've already paid back $800. My father was listed as a second owner and was going through a lawsuit, so we paid it off and changed the title to avoid any complications. We both come from complicated family situations.)

Current financial overview:

1.5K emergency fund (plan to grow this as much as possible)


Monthly income: $1960

Expenses:

Car insurance $56

Gas $120

Food $300-$400

Subscriptions $50

I have been paying $800 each month for my car, but now that's done.

Total current expenses: $635

I've been saving the rest mostly, with an amount for entertainment that ranges from $100-150 every month.

My partner recently came upon a large amount of money and works around 30 hours a week, and goes to the same college as me part-time. He has around $50K in savings/investments. His income is $1000 and regular expenses around almost the same (rent, food, gas, insurance, etc.). He also has a paid off 2012 car.

We have been dating for a year and a half and are going to move in together. We just signed the lease today for a 1 bedroom apartment starting May 1. We are not combining finances yet (separate bank accounts) because we're not married, just splitting combined expenses - we will split these based on proportional income for now (around 65% and 35%). We plan to get married in a few years, and have a very stable relationship.

So here's the new financial overview.

Rent $720

Power $100 (verified regular bill amount for our apartment unit with the power provider)

Internet (no cable) $50

Insurance $130 combined (both cars and renters insurance quote that we got)

Groceries $250

Cell phone plan (both require data for our jobs) $100 combined T-Mobile

Total: $1350

My portion: $877.50

Plus my expenses (gas, lunch at work, entertainment, etc.) leaves around $513 for savings every month. Minus $300 that I plan to pay him back on my car for. I also get quarterly bonuses occasionally, and will get a gap refund of $400 in the next few weeks. As well, the financial aid I'm getting next year will result in a refund of around $1500. Deposit and first month's rent are paid, so I have a month to build up my emergency fund.

We already have most our furniture and things for our apartment (deposits and first month's rent, washer/dryer, couch, TV, chairs, appliances, bed, etc.). We had some money set aside for moving already besides the above mentioned info.

I'm a realist, so I understand that we are young and perhaps the relationship won't last, so it's best to be prepared. The lease allows for written notice of 30 days and $50 per month left on lease to break it. So that's good. We really don't think that will happen, as we have been on long trips together, have never had a strong disagreement or argument, etc. We have both had pretty hard lives, have recently been very lucky, and are both very mature now.

So is there anything I'm overlooking? Is this a solid plan? I'm majoring in accounting and plan to obtain a CPA, so we are just living as cheaply as possible until we can increase our incomes. He is majoring in business management and plans to work in the pet food industry.

Sorry if this is long or maybe needed to be in r/relationships, but I'm a very analytical and cautious person.

personalfinance,"Hi /r/personalfinance, I was talking to my 90 year old grandfather today and I'm now concerned that he may be in some tax trouble.","The conversation started when he told me he missed filling his state taxes (Massachusetts). I took lots of accounting/tax classes in college so I have some understanding of tax codes, so my family always comes to me with questions. I start asking him if he has all of his tax forms and has everything ready to file, because at his age with his income he's likely going to get everything that was withheld back; at least that's what I thought.

After asking him some questions I find out he hasn't filed in 8 or 9 years because he received an informative letter way back that said ""Do Not File"" and he took this to mean he didn't have to file his taxes ever again. At first I thought his income was just Social Security and that he was no where near having to pay anything in taxes, but after digging through what documents I could find I came to realize he has well over $100k in stocks which have been paying dividends, over $100k in CD's, an annuity and a pension. Overall he's probably making close to $30k per year and as far as I could tell he isn't paying any taxes.

This isn't the problem, if he ends up owing back taxes we'll have to get those taken care of. My issue is that we don't have ANY of his tax documents (W2's, 1099's, anything) for this year as well as all the previous years. We also don't have a solid listing of all of his assets, I'm working on putting this together but I have no way of knowing if anything is missing.

personalfinance,I'm moving overseas. Need advice on whether to sell or rent condo in DC.,"Hi everyone.

I purchased a 2br/2ba condo in Washington DC in 2013.  I paid 315,000 for it.  I put 20% down and have a 4.125% interest rate.  I've taken a new job overseas starting in July and will have all housing paid for for the next 3 years.  I'm having a really difficult time trying to figure out what to do with my condo.  I've already met with a real estate agent and a property management company.  Here is the info for each route-

Selling:
Based off comps in the area, the agent wants to list at $425,000.  After I pay off the remainder on the mortgage and closing costs I've figured I'd be left with $151,000.  My current plan would be to work with a financial adviser to invest $125K of that.  After mortgage payments, taxes, insurance and money I've spent improving the unit, I'll have a $38K profit from the condo.

Renting:
The management company wants to list it at $2400/month and charges an 8% fee and 1/2 months rent for finding a tenant.  My monthly payment for mortgage, taxes and HOA is $1754 plus the mgmt fees would bring it to about $1950/month.  After taxes I would be netting about $325.00/month I think.

My biggest fear with renting is that something will happen to the building and I won't be there to handle it.  The building is a 100 year old row house that has been split into 4 condo's.  The other owners in the HOA are not too savvy about building maintenance and I've handled any work that needed to be done for the past few years.  I know the DC market is very hot right now and is only predicted to go up but with new construction all over the city, I'm worried the supply will greatly increase and prices will cool off but who knows.

I'm also not sure if I'll ever live in DC again, it's an open book from here.  My main financial goal is to someday start my own company and I would like to make sure that my investing is working towards having the savings to do that.  With the exception of the mortgage, I have no other current debt.  I'm single and have very few expenses. 

Any advice would be hugely appreciated!  I'm short on time and have no idea what to do.  Thanks!",finance,1430000840

personalfinance,Need advice on paying off my student loans,"Background info

I graduated from my undergrad last May and began my full student loan payments in January.  I currently have 4 loans that I took out each of the 4 years while I was in college through Sallie Mae.  Each of the loans were smart option student loans. While in school I was paying $25 a month per loan. Those monthly payments were applied to the interest on my loans. My loans have now been taken over by Navient. 

Info about my loans

Oldest to Newest

~ $26,900 at 10.62% interest; owe ~$330 per month

~ $13,300 at 7%; owe ~$140 per month

~ $17,600 at 7.5%; owe ~$190 per month

~ $20,000 at 7%; owe ~$210 per moth

~ $77800 owe in total

(numbers are rounded, if exact totals are needed I will update)

As of now I am paying ~$870 a month total towards my loans. A few weeks ago, I called Navient's customer service to see if I could change/lower my interest rate. The foreign customer rep basically told me I was screwed and stuck in my current situation because I chose to have the smart option loans.  They told me the only way I could lower my interest rates was to enroll in the automatic debit, but that would only lower my interest rate by either .25% or .025%. I cant remember. On top of that, my interest rates fluctuate so from what I understand my interest rates can increase at any moment. I am barely making a dent in my principal balance on my loans because my interest rates are so high. 

At this point I am unable to make an increase in my payments simply because I do not make enough money. I currently work part-time and bring home around ~$330 per week. The remaining money goes to other bills/food/my car. I am currently looking for a full time job but thats besides the point.

I also owe ~$30,000 in federal loans through mygreatlakes but I was able to delay the payments for a year by showing them I currently do not make enough money. Navient unfortunately does not allow me to do this.  

Is there anything I can do to lower my interest rates? What is the best plan of action to pay off my student debt?

I have about 27k in Federal student loan debt (5.75 interest rate). Monthly payments on my standard repayment plan are $450 (I actually consolidated which put me on a 20 year plan with a minimum payment of $215, but I almost always pay the $450 or more) No other debt.

After taxes, 401k and insurance, I take home about $3300. 

I'm budgeting with YNAB and trying to be more productive with my money. I'm currently paying $700 a month in rent, so I've thought that one way to do that would be buying a cheap (~100k) house.

If I go to Duke, my total debt after 4 years would be around $30k in subsidized federal loans and at least another $30k in private loans (probably from a 2nd mortgage on my parents' house). If I go to UW-Madison, I would only graduate with $20k in unsubsidized federal loans (or $15k if I finish in 3 years due to AP credits). 

They are both very good for my intended field of study (animal biology and pre veterinary medicine) and I know it would probably make financial sense to go to Wisconsin. However, I would get a better education at Duke and I just can't get over the thought that I'd be passing up a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to study at such a prestigious university (with a 9% acceptance rate, ranked #8 in the nation), and that if I were to go to Wisconsin (which is much easier to get into) all the studying and work I did to get a 35 on the ACT and a 4.0 gpa would've been a waste of time. I’ve been agonizing over this for the past month, and I just can’t decide!

gaming,A reminder - Your boycott of Steam/Valve/Skyrim doesn't have to be permanent to be effective.,"I'm furious over the paid modding rollout that Valve has implemented. I've personally adjusted my steam profile as well as my review of Skyrim on the steam marketplace to reflect my displeasure and the fact that I am carrying out a personal boycott for the time being.

I just want to remind everyone that might be feeling like they can't make a difference because they will eventually cave and buy more things on Steam:

It's ok!

The important part of the fight is RIGHT NOW.

Valve, Bethesda, and the entire industry is watching what happens RIGHT NOW the most, and the numbers and data that is pulled from this rollout are what will count.

If you choose to boycott Steam, Valve, and/or Bethesda, you need not swear off of Steam entirely to do so.

What counts is the immediate weeks/months following this rollout. Valve will be looking VERY closely at the data, as Gabe Newell himself has stated in his AMA over these next few weeks. 

If sales are dropping off, and the sale of paid mods are in turn doing poorly, this is the numbers that will matter.

If you can hold off on buying things from Steam for just ONE MONTH even, this will have a huge impact on the numbers and the pretty charts and graphs that Gabe looks at in executive meetings.

If you REALLY want to stick it out for the long haul, carry your boycott to at least the end of the fiscal quarter we are currently in.

I don't know what Valve runs for fiscal year, but most organizations inside the United States use the federal fiscal year for their accounting, on which you can find more information here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year

We would currently be in Q3 which will end at the end of June.

So if you can hold off your purchases and carry on any boycott you choose to partake in until June, you will have to largest effect you can have on Valve's numbers when they are looking at this rollout and its success level.

We do need to vote with our wallets. So do so intelligently, and good luck!",technology,1430025358

Now have $40k -- pay off current loan or put in short term savings?,"While we love our home, we will need to upgrade to a larger home in the next 5-8 years. We have 30% equity in our current home, savings, and recently the net proceeds from the sale of a rental. We have a 3.65% interest rate with 27 years on the mortgage. 

Thoughts on where to put the proceeds from the rental (~$40k) if we want to use that for saving for a future personal house? We intend to sell our home for use of a down payment on the next.  Originally, a basic savings account or CD seemed to be the safest option, but I was thinking... why not pay down the current mortgage and have it act like a savings account with guaranteed rate of 3.65%?  Since we'll want to upgrade in the same area, if house prices swing we should be relatively in the same boat. 

Another thought was to refinance w/ a 15 year (or maybe ARM) and a slightly lower rate and put down the additional $40k from the rental sale since we can afford the increase in payment, but pay less interest.

Bitcoin,Our contribution to Bitcoin community,"Hi guys. We are going to tell you an interesting story. Back in the days, we were young, brave and excited by Bitcoin. We began to create various Bitcoin projects. Our first project was the Russian Bitcoin exchange btc-up.com. After our first try we decided to build an exchange that could meet global market requirements. 
We immersed ourselves in work. The development took a lot of time and money. The project has not been open-source from the start. It took more than $100,000 to build a working Alpha version of the exchange. Its features are truly amazing. This is probably the fastest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Also, it has such stunning features as leverage with margin manager, short sales and advanced order types (SL,TP,TS). FIX protocol support is also present in one of our repositories.
However, this project was not to be revealed due to the recent law situation in Russia. Strict bills, Federal Security Service actions and Central Bank’s intolerance to cryptocurrencies have made us lost our time and funds. Now, as our contribution to the community, we give away our source code.   
**Here is the link: https://bitbucket.org/margincallio/**    
The position of our government is unambiguous - it does not need cryptocurrencies. So we decided to build  a new project outside of Russia called www.margincall.io Please help us to spread the word or offer someting else. We’re eager to hear from any of you .  
Stay Hungry, stay foolish.

TECHICAL INFO  
We've built a MarginCall branded in-memory currency exchange core (CoreCX) written in C# and supporting various trading features (leverage, short sales, advanced order types) and several protocols for external communication (native, FIX, multicast). This is a major element in our technological stack. CoreCX is responsible for order matching, real-time accounts risk management and margin parameters calculation, trading information interchange and support for external market access gateways. Our core makes it easy to launch any currency exchange as it's not tied to Bitcoin only. CoreCX uses MCA (multi-currency architecture) which makes it possible to add new trading pairs with just a few clicks. As its necessary complement, we've implemented a daemon written in Elixir to handle core messages and utilize PGSQL effectively. Daemon is also capable of real-time push notifications to our WebApp with the use of web sockets.

personalfinance,Question about saving versus paying off student loans faster,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 

Ok so first some quick background info:

* 27yrs old
* $0 in credit card debt
* $4,000 in emergency fund
* $13,000 in vanguard funds (currently earning around 7.8%)
* $12,000 in roth IRA (also earning around 7.8%)
* $9,000 in student loans with an interest rate of 6.8% and minimum payment of $100 (half of which right now just goes towards paying that month's accrued interest)

If I am understanding everything correctly it makes the most sense to continue earning interest in my investment accounts and to pay the minimum payments on my student loans because any extra money I pay towards student loans is money I could have put into vanguard where I am making slightly more than I am loosing. Is this correct?




.

However, part of me feels that I should be trying to either pay the loan down quicker or take some subset of my vanguard fund out (maybe $4,000) to make a large payment on my student loan and therefore not see so much of my required monthly payment go towards monthly accrued interest payments. OR maybe I should try and pay more than minimum so that a greater percentage of my monthly payments are going towards paying off the principal instead of towards interest. OR I should just leave it alone and make the minimum payments.

personalfinance,"Taking out loans for law school, and trying to decided between private and public. More details within.","I will be taking out roughly 42,000 dollars in loans in my first year, 43,000 in my second year, and 44,000 in my third year. They can be public or private. The advantage of private loans is that rates are pretty close to historic lows, and I will ultimately pay less money. The advantages of public ones are the various protections they have against me being totally screwed, and the public service loan forgiveness program.

My school has a program that helps with loan repayment. Up to 50,000 dollars a year, they will make your full loan payments. Up to 65,000 they will cover all but 2,250 a year. Up to 80,000 they cover all but 6,750. Above 80,000 you pay 6,750 plus 60% of your income above 80,000. There is more granularity in there, but those are the general numbers.

Running through scenarios it seems like there are a few possibilities, some of are better with private, and some of which are better with public.

1: Large firm job starting at 160,00 a year: This is not my most favored job, but it seems like most people at my school ultimately wind up falling into it even if it wasn't their goal going in. Private loans seem way better here. I won't be getting repayment help, and with much less interest accruing while I'm in school, I'll save around 30-40k by taking private loans.

2: Federal government starting at 70k, going to 100k after a couple years: This is the job I'm going for. It seems like people who want it tend to be able to get it, but it varies based on how government hiring works out in a given year. If there's a big budget fight, it can hurt a lot.

If I get this job, I'll have some loan repayment help from my school, but also be paying a lot of it myself. If I have a federal loan, I'll probably do public service loan forgiveness, which will make the federal loans better. On PSLF I'd need to hold the job for ten years continuously though, so it's a bit of a gamble, and if I leave government, I'd wish I'd done private loans.

3: Legal aid stuff paying 30-60k. This isn't super likely, but I've thought about it. Since everything will be covered by the school, I don't think it matters at all what kind of loans I get.

Do people have any thoughts? It seems like the federal loans are the better option, but owing less money is really tempting.",finance,1430103455

I don't know what the interest rate is or how long the term is for, they only said it was high verbally because I was a first time buyer. But again, haven't signed anything or even gave a down payment. He just made me initial a sheet of paper with hand written notes saying after interest the car was around $13,499| $3000 down payment and about $385 - $395 monthly payments. I did initial it and a little bit later, this is the financial adviser by the way (he was in and out), came in and said he was able to bring the interest rate down, but didn't say how much, and I stupidly didn't think to ask because I was waiting to read the legal contract. An hour later or so I drove of with the new car.

I was driving the new (2013 Kia Rio) car around town today and I noticed that it kinda jerks or jolts while accelerating. The car is used, less than 25,000 miles on it and on the car fax it showed no previous accidents or shop visits for repairs. The car didn't come with a warranty and was listed as ""as is"" I'm afraid it could have some transmission/ mechanical issues? I don't know but it doesn't feel right while accelerating.
What can I do? Can I back out of this? What can be causing the jolting? Is this normal for a 2013 Kia Rio? I just want to take it back and get my old car back. I can't tell them I think there are mechanical issues with it right? They'll say its my fault? Please please please give me some advise. I don't have anyone else to turn to for help.

Edit: Actually, he didn't say it was $13,499 after interest, that's just what was on the piece of paper and the listing price on the car was under $12,000 so I just assumed it would be $13,499 after interest.",finance,1430104047

Now my last employer wanted me to sign a severance agreement basically giving up all my rights and I walked out and kind of quit before I signed anything.

Four months later, I receive a check from Prudential that shows this ""lump sum payment"" as a result of ""termination benefit payment"". It's a lot of money, but I want to be careful about depositing this. If I deposit this, will my ex-employer come after me trying to force me to sign the severance agreement?

economy,Fitch Downgrades Japan to 'A'; Outlook Stable,"Fitch Ratings has downgraded Japan's Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) to 'A' from 'A+'. The issue ratings on Japan's senior unsecured foreign and local currency bonds are also downgraded to 'A' from 'A+'. The Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. The Country Ceiling is downgraded to 'AA' from 'AA+' and the Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR is downgraded to 'F1' from 'F1+'.

**KEY RATING DRIVERS**

The downgrade of Japan's IDRs reflects the following key rating drivers:-

* Fitch's downgrade reflects the fact that the Japanese government did not include sufficient structural fiscal measures in its budget for the fiscal year April 2015-March 2016 (FY15) to replace a deferred consumption tax increase. The agency had placed Japan's IDRs on Rating Watch Negative on 9 December 2014 following the government's decision to delay the scheduled consumption tax increase that was the centrepiece of its medium-term fiscal consolidation effort. At that time, Fitch said the ratings would be downgraded in the absence of broadly equivalent fiscal measures to replace the deferred consumption tax increase in the FY15 budget.

* The FY15 budget cut corporate tax rates, although the base was broadened, making the measure's impact broadly neutral overall. However, the government has said it wants to cut corporate tax rates again in FY16. The government also introduced a supplementary budget for FY14 in January 2015 that essentially spent an unexpected increase in revenue. These developments increase Fitch's uncertainty over the degree of political commitment to fiscal consolidation. The government is set to unveil a new fiscal strategy in the summer of 2015. The details of the strategy will be important, but the strength of the government's commitment to implement it will be even more important and will only become clearer over time.

* The government may still achieve its interim fiscal target of a 3.3% of GDP primary budget deficit (excluding earthquake reconstruction spending) in FY15. Corporate tax receipts are rising strongly, despite the rate cut, driven by buoyant corporate profits. High dividend payments are also boosting personal income tax receipts. The government expects these items, together with the lagged effect of the 2014 consumption tax hike, to generate about 0.6% of GDP in additional revenue in FY15. However, corporate profits are being boosted partly by the 8% trade-weighted depreciation of the Japanese yen in the twelve months to end-March 2015. This is unlikely to be sustainable. Pressure on the budget could rise in FY16 if corporate profits fell back.

* Japan's main sovereign credit and rating weakness is the high and rising level of government debt. Fitch projects the gross general government (GG) debt to GDP ratio to rise to 244% of GDP by end-2015, by far the highest ratio of any rated sovereign. The Japanese sovereign also has a large stock of assets. The GG held financial assets worth 113% of GDP at end-2014, including foreign reserves worth about 27% of GDP. However, the agency focuses on gross indebtedness in assessing sovereign solvency, as described in our sovereign rating criteria. Japan's net GG financial liabilities are still the highest in the OECD (143% of GDP at end-2014). The rise in Japan's net GG financial liability ratio (62pp) over the period 2007-2014 was the second-highest in the OECD behind Ireland (83pp), suggesting the net position is also deteriorating relatively rapidly.

* Japan's gross GG debt to GDP ratio is projected to stabilise around 250% of GDP in 2020 under Fitch's baseline fiscal projection. However, Fitch's analysis indicates that the debt dynamics are highly vulnerable to variations in parameters such as economic growth, the budget deficit, or yields. This vulnerability is a negative factor for the ratings.

* The Japanese sovereign's exceptionally strong financing flexibility supports the ratings, despite weaknesses and vulnerabilities elsewhere in the public finances. The ten-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield has averaged 0.34% year-to-date (as of 23 April 2015), down from 0.55% in 2014. The average maturity of the JGB stock has gradually lengthened to 7 years and 10 months by December 2014, from 5 years and 1 month in March 2005.

* Sovereign funding flexibility rests mainly on the massive stock of savings of the Japanese private sector and the strong ""home bias"" with which these savings are invested. The Japanese domestic non-financial sector had 689% of GDP in assets at end-2014, up from 564% at end-2008. The Japanese household sector ran a financial surplus of 4.2% of GDP in 2014, above the five-year average of 3.8%. About half of the JGB stock is held in the broader public sector, which reduces the possibility of a self-fulfilling loss of confidence in the JGB market.

* High private-sector savings also support the external finances, which are a credit strength. The sovereign had trn in foreign reserves at end-2014, underpinning a net sovereign foreign-currency creditor position worth 29% of GDP at end-2014, stronger than the 'A' or 'AA' medians. Fitch projects the Japanese economy as a whole to hold a net creditor position in debt-like assets worth about 76% of GDP by end-2015. The overall international investment position recorded net assets worth about 66% of GDP by end-September 2014 (latest available), up from 33% at end-2005.

* Sovereign financing flexibility is currently being supported by the Bank of Japan's (BoJ's) quantitative and qualitative easing policies. The BoJ's holdings of government securities rose to 27.3% of the stock at end-March 2015, from 12.1% at end-2012 (according to BoJ data). The role of the BoJ as supplier of a global reserve currency endows Japan with exceptional policy flexibility and supports the sovereign's funding position. These factors are strengths in the credit profile. However, the BoJ will face a challenge in eventually unwinding the expansion of its balance sheet without triggering a sharp rise in financial-market volatility.

* Japan's macroeconomic performance is a rating weakness. Fitch cut its forecast for 2015 growth to 1.3% in March 2015 from 1.5% in December 2014, driven by the weaker-than-expected recovery in domestic demand following the April 2014 consumption tax hike. The five-year-average growth rate (2011-2015) of 0.8% is well below the medians for the 'A' range (3.1%) or for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development group of richer countries (1.6%). Inflation excluding the effects of the April 2014 consumption tax hike was around zero in February. Prospects for success in permanently lifting the economy's real and nominal GDP growth rates remain in doubt, two years after the launch of ""Abenomics"". Progress on growth-enhancing structural reform remains limited.

* Japan's ratings are supported by strong credit fundamentals including a high-income, wealthy economy; high governance standards; strong core public institutions; and deeply-entrenched social and political stability.

**RATING SENSITIVITIES**

The Stable Outlooks reflect Fitch's assessment that upside and downside risks to the ratings are currently broadly balanced.

The main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action are:

* Evidence that the authorities' commitment to fiscal consolidation was weakening, such as failure to articulate a clear and credible strategy for stabilising public debt ratios, or slippage relative to targets

* Weaker macroeconomic performance than Fitch expects for a sustained period, intensifying the challenge in stabilising the public finances

* A sharp and sustained rise in real interest rates demanded by investors to hold government debt

The main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action, are:

* Stabilisation of public debt ratios; growing confidence that public indebtedness could achieve a sustainable downwards path that was reasonably robust to cyclical economic volatility

* Sustained and broad-based economic recovery, including acceleration in nominal GDP growth

**KEY ASSUMPTIONS**

* Fitch assumes that the confidence of the Japanese public in the country's basic economic and financial stability is maintained, such that the Japanese sovereign's exceptional funding flexibility remains intact

* Fitch further assumes that there is no significant escalation of global or regional geopolitical risks, for example Japan's maritime territorial disputes with China, to a level that could disrupt economic activity

personalfinance,Considering selling one of my homes instead of continuing to rent it out. Need some advice.,"I am a 26 year old college student graduating in the fall. I have two homes, one having a loan of 57k at 4.5% and a second that I purchased through a home equity line of credit off of my first home, it is a loan of about 59k.

I have been renting the first home out for 3 years and have evicted tenants every year for the last 3 years, (I am currently in the process of evicting this year's tenant). I charge 1250 a month and my expenses total are ~800 a month. If I sold this home I expect to come away with 150k after all realtor fees and repairs. This would leave me with ~93k cash.

I would likely just get a home loan on the second house seeing as interest rates are so frickin cheap. I am moving out of this home on June 1st and expect to rent it out for 1250/monthly, it is in a college town so hopefully if I can't get a good family renting I can at last resort get college students.

I will be renting a place in the city starting June 1st costing me ~1200 for rent/parking + utility expenses. My job is very likely to be the last job I have, as it is in a niche field and going to work there feels nothing like work, and the owner of the business and I have had numerous conversations on my taking over the business. I am being groomed to take over the business in ~7 to 10 years.

To get to my main question, does it make sense at all for me to deal with all of the b.s. that being a landlord entails? My thoughts on keeping the house are mostly that once I have it paid off I will have a huge bargaining chip in the future if I needed a large loan for any business ventures I would like to take on.

My thoughts on selling the house include:
 - No longer being house-poor as I have been consistently since I purchased in 2009.
 - Being able to possibly invest jointly with my boss in a commercial distribution warehouse.
 - Paying off credit card balances
 - Paying down a large chunk of the second home to secure a better interest rate.

I am a university student in Texas, and I am a part of an organization whose faculty adviser was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We organized a 5k/Half Marathon and through ticket sales, shirt orders, and a GoFundMe donation account, we were able to raise roughly $2000.

We didn't want to give our adviser a stack of cash, so we deposited the money into our student organization finance center account (the university-run organization bank, basically?). When we tried to cut a check for the money, the finance center stopped us and said that we would be paying 28% of our donation as a ""federal income tax backup withholding"" and only $1440 would be going to our adviser because they would be considering it an ""award"" rather than a ""donation"".

So they gave us three options:

*1. ""Gross up"" the amount to ~$2800, using about $800 from our/the organization's pockets to hit $2000 after the withholding fee.

*2. Suck it up and give only $1440 to our adviser, with the rest going to the Finance Center (for tax purposes?).

*3. Get a ""Federal Identification Number"" and ""Recipient's IRS W-9"" for it to be listed as a donation, rather than an award.


My questions are as follows:

*How do we go about getting a federal identification number for our donation recipient?

*If we provide the adviser's W-9 and federal identification number, will that money be taxed/withheld after she receives it? (i.e. will she have to file that money as taxable income after she receives it?)

*Is there any exemption that will allow her to not have to pay 28% on her side?

I am currently applying $827 from a debt snowball (made up of a past car loan payment, raises from my job, and other extra income). I view the car as a tangible asset that when I pay it off, I'll have a bigger ""win"" feeling and strengthened motivation to pay down the other loan compared to paying off the intangible student loan.

personalfinance,Debt Restructuring,"Hey PF.  Hoping to get some advice on my current situation.  My wife and I have about $20k in revolving cc debt, at an average of 15% interest.  Credit is about 90% utilized(me), 60%(her) and utilization is the biggest ding on our credit.  I have a score in the very low 600s, and my wife is in the high 600s.  Neither of us have collections, bankruptcy, or a history of late payments, and both of us have ~10 accounts with about a decade of history.

We want to get to a position to buy a house, but need to pay off the debt and improve my credit first.  We have a combined pre-tax income of around $170k and are currently making more than minimum payments to pay down the CC debt.  My wife was out of work, added a baby, medical bills, and our income was significantly lower so we used CC to make ends meet temporarily.  We are on our feet now, health (and insurance) are good, and we are both stable on the job front.  We live in a high cost of living area, and due to work and family requirements are unable to move. 

Is it feasible with our income and credit scores to get a personal loan through a credit union, or maybe a low/no-interest offer on a credit card with a high enough limit to do a balance transfer/consolidation loan and knock down that interest rate?  It seems like the logical route, as we could lower interest and improve utilization ratio at the same time, but I don't really want to go into my credit union and have them run my credit only to get shot down.  I have around $100k in a 401(k) that I'd prefer not to touch, and no notable investments aside from that.  I'm open to other options, but feel I have scaled down the lifestyle end as much as possible and want to make sure I am going about my recovery efficiently.",finance,1430158294

I'm married 40yo and I've been following this community for awhile, learning a lot from all of you.  I reviewed my current investment/saving found that I might have enough in traditional 401k/IRA to be considered FIed, but I'd like your advise whether I'm able to RE yet.  I'm having a hard time figuring the RE part.  I'd love to get out of my high stress job if it's possible.

** my annual expense x 25 = $50k x 25 = $1,250,000 **

In assets, I have:

*  $1,250,000k in traditional IRA/401K

*  $220k in Vanguard taxable account investing in ETFs.

* $50k in saving account

* $13k in Roth IRA

* 1 primary resident valued at $ 430k, with 265k still owed in mortgage ($2000/mo payment - 26 yrs left on 30 yr fixed term)

*  1st single family rental valued at $190k, with $ 68K mortgage 

*  2nd single family rental valued at $175k, with $67K mortgage

* from 1st and 2nd rentals net me about $600/mo after all expenses + mortgages.   

* from jobs, SO and I make about the same and combined about $250K/year (we are not eligible to contribute to ROTH IRA)

** Expenses: **

* $50k/year and this includes

* $24k/year in Mortgage

* $12k /year in Foods, household supplies, gas

* $11k/year utilities

* $800/year in term life insurance

* 2.2k/year car insurance + maintenance + registration

** Questions: **

* How can we get to RE as soon as possible?  

* How much we need to have in cash, taxable account or saving to generate enough cash to consider RE?

* What adjustment I need to make to achieved RE asap? 

- selling the rentals to pay off primary resident?

- stop contributing to IRA/40K instead putting income into taxable Vanguard account?

- my SO likes to continue to work, will I be able to RE now? (SO's yearly income is $140k)

Banking,"Am I unreasonably miffed? Mortgage company returns $25,000 check in an unsealed envelope.","Pre-emtive Edit: Yes, for that amount I should have sent a certified check as a matter of principle.

I'm paying off my house and I thought I would almost finish it with a large personal check; and deliver the final payment as a cashier's check after giving myself a month to get my insurance and property tax folks are in the loop. Figured it would be cashed and counted before I would get to my CU and wanted the thrill. Dropped it in an inside P.O. slot. 

They returned the check to me as written, along with the payment coupon and a letter stating $10,000 is their maximum allowable non-certified funds.

And that's fine. What isn't is that the basic, commercial window #10 triangle-flap envelope they sent it back in was completely unsealed. It's clear the glue was never moistened. Their logo and ""XXXX MORTGAGE"" in large cap print was the return address, and my name and address were in the type of basic font that definitely makes it looks like a one-off printed letter, as opposed to a designed letterform or monthly statement.

personalfinance,MBA Student Loan Options,"Hi everyone,

Recently, I have been accepted into a top-20 MBA program and plan to attend this coming fall. Unfortunately, I did not receive any merit scholarships with my admission. However, as this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I would like to attend earlier in life rather than later, I plan on going into a substantial amount of debt (read: ~150k) in order to attend.

That being said, I am looking at loan options and have found several including Unsubsidized Federal Direct Student (Stafford) Loans and private lenders.

What are the advantages of the Stafford loans? From my point of view, the fact that they have a 1.073% origination fee and a fixed interest rate of 6.21% (10 year standard repayment) seems excessively high. I understand that there are some things that the Fed can offer such as IBR, PAYE, and loan forgiveness, which private lenders cannot, but assuming that I will make all of my payments on time, is there any other reason to go with Stafford loans as opposed to taking out a lump-sum loan from a private lender? Furthermore, with the cap of the Stafford loans being 20.5k/yr, I'd have to borrow the remainder of the loan from a private lender anyways.

From the private lenders, I have found several with favorable interest rates and no origination fees such as CommonBond (10 year: 4.74% to 5.99% fixed, 3.15% and 4.78% current variable) and Social Finance (10 year: 5.875% fixed, 3.930% current variable). I believe that I have a decent enough credit score to qualify for a relatively low interest rate, especially if I opt for the riskier variable interest rate which I plan to put a large portion of my post-MBA income towards and pay off sooner rather than later.

Does anyone have experience with the aforementioned private lenders (CommonBond, SoFi), and would it be a good choice to borrow the entirety of the tuition/living costs from these private lenders and forego the Stafford loans? Also, does anyone have recommendations of other private lenders I should be looking at?

Apologies if this has been asked recently - I searched through the student loans PF wiki page and also did a search for the topic. Thanks!",finance,1430170303
personalfinance,Does it make sense to pay off 401k loan early?,"Please forgive me if this has been answered elsewhere. I currently have an outstanding 401k loan of $28,000 with a 3.25% interest rate that I took for a primary residence loan, to be repaid over 30 years. 

At the time I took the loan, I wasn't making very much money but I knew I had a large raise coming up within a year so I felt borrowing $30k from my 401k for a down payment on my house was a good idea, even though it wiped out what meager savings I had. I was eager to take advantage of the low mortgage interest rates at the time (3.0%) and came across a good investment property.

Since receiving my raise, I have been socking away cash aggressively. I now have around $42,000 in total savings. 

My question is should I use this money to repay my 401k loan?

- I'm secure in my job and feel reasonable confident that I will not be unemployed in the near future

- My annual loan maintenance fee is $40

- I max out my 401k every year

- My plan does not allow me to make larger or more frequent payments unless the payment is for the full balance of the loan ($28k)

- The 3.25% interest is paid back into my account

- I do not have any other outstanding debts (besides my mortgage, of course) and live well within my means

Is there a benefit to paying this loan off faster than the 30 year term (besides being taxed as income, should I lose my job)? Should I take the money that I've saved and invest it elsewhere? Or should I keep the savings aside for an emergency fund? I could also use some of the money for (non-urgent but necessary) home repairs.

Any advice is appreciated!",finance,1430172074
personalfinance,I dwindled away over $100K and I'm only 20 years old,"(This is a throw away because I don't like people knowing this.) 

Okay, for a bit of context, my Mother passed away a few years ago and it was only around 1 year ago that her estate was settled. I received a little over $100,000 AUD (I'm Australian) not long after I had turned 19. This was highly unexpected as she didn't technically have much in her name due to irrelevant reasons, so it was a major surprise when I was informed. 

Anyway, prior to this, I was just your average small-town boy with a modest job and still living at home. I was brought up in a low-income home, and always made do with what we had, and was more than happy with that. I never complained about money, and my parents were the type of people that would give us kids their last $10 if we needed it. They weren't wasteful, and were incredibly humble people. I have been fortunate enough, though, to always be able to land myself well-paying jobs, and I believe this is where my bad spending habits start. I was making $1000+ a week in my first year out of school, with very minimal expenses combined with free accommodation + food 5 days a week (living on site). I held that job for around 10 months, before I decided I didn't like it. From this, you may assume that I should have saved quite a generous amount, but I in fact did not save one single cent. I left that job poorer than when I started. I would come home on weekends and blow all my money on whatever the hell I felt like, buy all the latest gadgets and toys, drink and gamble myself stupid, and whatever else 18 year old boys enjoy doing. I have never had a job that paid less than $20/hr, yet somehow I had absolutely nothing to show for it. I was living paycheck to paycheck, blowing it all, and then borrowing money from family and friends because I knew I'd be more than able to pay it back the following week. And hence started a vicious cycle. So by the time I inherited this $100K, I thought that this would be the end of my troubles. I was slowly making the transition into adulthood, and I had a nice little head start to help me along. 

Nope. Wrong. By the time I received this money, I owed my Dad around $6K, had around $3K in credit card debt and owed around $2K for my car. Rightly, the first thing I did with this money was make myself debt free (I should add that I gave my Dad $20K all up, because he deserved at least that much for putting up with my shit for 19 years). So within a day I was already $25K down. Within the space of a few months I had gone out and bought myself a new car, new motorbike, TV, gadgets, games, clothes, gone on road trips and festivals and other stupid, little, unnecessary purchases. Cue around another approx $45K gone. So now I was down to around $30K, and this was the point when I realised WTF am I doing. I wasn't stupid enough to quit my job, as obviously this amount of money wasn't lifetime sustainable, so I still had a steady income week-to-week and was still living at home, but somehow this money was still dwindling faster than a US cop pulls his gun. So I now had around $30K sitting in my bank account, and I had bought all the toys I wanted, had all my fun, and realised that okay, now I need to start acting sensible and invest/save this money wisely. I was finally starting to lower my spending, began reading into the best ways to utilise this money I had left, opened a high-interest savings account for the time being and stopped going out every weekend. Then, all of a sudden, I have a petty fight with a girl I was seeing, basically said a big fuck you to her, packed all my things into my car and moved to an entirely new city by myself. It was such a spontaneous decision I didn't organise it one little bit. I barely even knew where I was going. For the first few months, I was unemployed, paying a grossly excessive amount of rent, and basically living like a king with the money I had left. By the time I was down to around $5K, I went out and got myself another well-paying job, and cut back on a lot of spending. I guess one of the reasons I spent it so erratically was because I felt like I didn't deserve it, and every time I looked at it I was reminded of my mother, and how I would have gave it all back in an instance to spend one last day with her. So I guess I decided to use this money to treat myself, to go out and have fun to make up for the last few years of heartache, and one part of me is glad that I did. At the same time though, I have now reached a point where I realised how much was wasted unnecessarily and how stupid I was. 

Cue to today, roughly 1 year later, I have almost zero savings and although I try not to dwell on it, I often wish I had been a lot smarter than what I was. I owe $4K in credit card debt, I owe my Dad $5K and my brother $5K (both agreed to pay back over 2 years). One plus is that I have no loans, I own my car and bike and all the furniture/white goods/electronics in my apartment. I make around $600/week and also study full-time (will owe approx. $30K student loans when I finish). My expenses include the following per month:


$1200 for rent 


$80 for utilities


$120 for phone bill


$300 for food and fuel


$90 for internet, VPN, Netflix and Spotify


$60 for gym


$60 for cable TV



I have absolutely no value for money. I see money and I spend it. I have always lived by the philosophy that I'd rather die with 1 million good memories, than 1 million wasted dollars. But I am now at a point in my life where I need to start becoming financially independent, and starting to realise that I need to find a good balance between the two. I know it's necessary for survival, and I know that I will always be in a position where I will be making money, but I just keep digging myself further and further into holes. Is this because I am too optimistic about my future? Am I too careless with my spending? I have tried budgeting, keeping detailed records of all my expenses, cutting down on wasteful spending, reading through pages and pages of financial advice, this sub, putting my money in places it's harder to touch and so on and so on. All to no avail. I'll finally get on a good run, have myself in a decent financial position, and then a friend will call me to come away for the weekend or go to a show I really want to see or a new game will come out and I just can't help myself. I go overboard, all in the name of fun. Money comes and goes, experiences last a lifetime. Is this a bad attitude to have? Or am I just simply still too young to really be worrying about this sort of thing right now? I've never been *that* desperate for money, or had to starve for a week or anything that major. I have had times where I've struggled to put fuel in my car or unable to pay phone bills or had to count silver coins to buy myself a meal, but I think every young adult/uni student goes through those moments. But I just feel like I should really have a hell of a lot more than what I do to show for myself. I mean, I live 1000's of miles away from home, supporting myself and living on my own, but I still often feel like I should be doing a whole lot better than what I am. Basically, Reddit, and I apologise for the rambling and the wall-of-text, but I am asking how the hell do you teach yourself the value of money? Do you think that me wasting all this money in a space of a year, from the point of being $100K up, to now being over $10K down, was a valuable life lesson? Or is it just a sign of a never-ending cycle? Is this more a personal problem than a money problem? I just don't even know where to begin.


EDIT: some further questions: 

My CC interest rate is 19.74% p.a. Should I consider transferring this to a 0% for x amount of months kind of deal?

What should I be focused on more right now, eliminating debt, or building up a decent savings account for emergencies and what-not?

Is investing out of the question until I am in a financial position more stable to do so?

personalfinance,"24yo College student, What do i do???","Hello PF, I am a 24 yr old college student (Undergrad; started late) projected graduation Spring 2016. I must have had an epiphany of some sort but I am now really concerned but also interested in planning my financial future. I apparently came upon these thoughts when me and my GF were discussing dream homes/cars/careers etc. and it dawned on me that my personal finances aren't what you would say, livin lux. Ok enough with the background info, I currently have a decent job, for a college student i guess, pays about 1.5k/month. Just got into investments (stocks) so since i'm a beginner and have maybe a slight clue of what I am doing, i started off with $500 to get my feet wet. Recently, while reading through the comments in this sub i noticed some members mentioning Charles Schwab/Ally and other online banks who offer pretty good interest rates on there checking/savings account. So basically I've read in to both and Ally has a 1% apy savings while Schwab has a brokerage account (better for me because of lower commission fees) but only at .5% apy. I was wondering would it be a good idea for me to open an account in both banks, Ally for savings and Schwab for investments, or would just 1 suffice? Also any additional financial advice is welcomed. 

Expenses include:

-Phone bill ~$50/month

-Car insurance ~$150/month

-Gas &amp; Toll ~$200/month

-Rent ~550/month

-Food ~150/month

So with the expenses im left with about ~$400 of spending cash some of which i plan to fund a savings account and maybe some investments (if thats even enough).

I make $56k gross a year + quarterly bonuses, she makes $45k a year. Her paychecks she was getting ~$1950 gross, ~$1550 net, and I'm getting $2333 gross and $1464 net. I'm putting 10% into my 401(k), she is doing 8%, so there's a small difference there. We found out she was claiming exempt, and hadn't withheld any Fed. taxes for the year, so that explains why her paycheck was so much higher and we fixed that right away (and luckily it's only been 2 pay periods for her so we caught it before it became an issue). I had been only taking 1 allowance, but each paycheck $303 is being withheld for Federal, and it's been $3883 YTD. Way too damn much, so I changed it to 2 allowances, and I'm waiting to see the changes on my next paycheck. Is there anything else I can do or need to look into as to why I'm getting so much withheld each paycheck?     

I only had 1 allowance all of 2014 as well, but only got about $1100 Federal tax return, I thought it would be more. I did move from AZ to CA at the end of the year in 2014, so maybe I'm just feeling the higher CA taxes.

personalfinance,Am I making the right decision?,"Hey PersonalFinance.

So I think I'm ready to buy an apartment/condo. I'm looking at an apartment that is $330k and I have $15k saved up. I was pre-approved to borrow more than what I need, but I won't go anywhere near there. I've also paid off my car loans as of this month (yay) so I have no other recurring expenses except for my student loans at $500/month and rent at $1,730/month.

I make $110k a year. My other expenses are your usual: food, gas, insurance, etc. I sock away 7% of my money to my 401k and try to save $1,000 a month straight into my savings account.

If I end up buying that apartment, my monthly payment would be $2,100 with PMI. Cash to close would be around $28k (including my $15k down payment) - the seller would in theory cover a big portion of the closing cost (seller's subsidy) and my agent will also refund 1% that will go towards closing costs. Also, instead of paying PMI, I also have the option to may $1980 with LPMI, but the interest rate will be higher by .25 percent for that loan.

Now I know the general rule is to put 20% down, however the borrowing cost is really cheap and rent is super expensive in my area. Once I get my tax refund, I think it'll net to right around the same amount that i pay for rent, but I'll live in a bigger place to accommodate for my growing family.

personalfinance,Home down payment vs. paying of remaining debt.,"My significant other and I are coming up on a time where we will spend a significant amount of money in the next few years and am hoping for some advice. Our current situation is as follows:
- We currently have $145K in savings (some was gifted money) and are saving about $2,000-$2,500 a month (we together make about $130,000/year.) 
-My spouse is starting a doctorate program where tuition will cost roughly $65K over the next 4 years.
-We are looking to buy a house in the next year. This will be our first home so the down payment will be out of the savings.
-Our combined total debt is roughly $30,000 between remaining student and car loans, in which we're paying $600/month for (roughly 10K each in student and 10K left on a car loan.)

I am curious what others would do with the money, by the time we're looking to buy a house I figure we will have saved another $15K, bringing total to $160,000. 

My thoughts are:
1. set aside the $65,000 for the whole doctorate. 
2. Keep $15,000 in an emergency fund
This is where I'm torn:
1.Do we put 20% down on a house (the remaining $80K after tuition and emergency fun) to get a better interest rate and avoid paying a PMI.
OR
2. Do we pay off the remainder of our debt and put closer to 12% down and take a little higher interest rate and a PMI.",finance,1430196253

We are both in our late 20s (28 and 29). I have been in the workforce about 2 years and my wife is a phd student and works part time teaching and researching. Between the two of us we make approximately 80k and have about 150k in student debt at 6.75% interest. We rent an apartment for about 1k. We have our first child due in less than 3 weeks! We live pretty frugally.

I have zero experience handling stocks or trading or anything like that. Instead, for the past year I just contribute 15% of my income to my 401k (employer matches 3%) My wife contributes $400/month into a Roth IRA. We have about 12k in savings (bank account) for emergencies.

We hate having such high interest rates on my student loans so we are trying to knock them out as quickly as possible. Depending on the month (my income varies) we pay between 1500 and 2000 on our loans. After savings and paying our loans and rent and bills and everything else we generally have about 400 left per month.

My questions are:
1) am I correctly balancing the need for long term retirement savings with the need to knock out high interest debt?
2) instead of just passively putting money in a 401k and IRA, should I be taking a more active roll in investing?
3) if I eventually save up about 25k in savings, should I take between 5 and 10k and invest in stocks or something else?
4) how important should home ownership be for our family?
5) wth am I going to do about this kid financially?!? We are getting by just fine with the two of us but a third in the mix is frightening.

personalfinance,What can I do with my spare room that isnt roommates/terrifying? [x-post r/frugal],"I posted this in /r/frugal but Im open to any creative ideas so I figured I would cast a wider net. 


Im 26(F), grad student in a STEM program full time that also runs full time through summer, absolutely fed up with the roommate situation. I'm just feelin ""too old for this shit"". I have anxiety and I have a sound sensitivity disorder (misophonia/hyperacusis), and I own a condo attached to other units, so Im not only annoyed by sounds coming in, Im paranoid about my homes sounds (mostly the front door) being heard by the other units.
I feel my home should be my safe place, and lately it feels like its not. Its a small-ish space, 2 bedrooms, shared bathroom/living room/kitchen. My current roommate is loud by nature, as in he thinks he isnt making any noise, but he slams -fridge, microwave, washer/dryer, closets, drops the heavy toilet lids/seats instead of setting them down, and most problematically the front door, which rattles the walls of the units next to ours. Hes just... unaware, and thankfully moving out to an apartment (where Im sure his neighbors will be thrilled to have the addition of yet another noisy dude in their apartment). But honestly, even with screening, I have the worst luck with roommates, especially those who started out as friends. Ive had my meager supplies stolen, carpets and walls damaged, ciggs smoked in the house when I said no (cigg) smoke allowed, etc etc, just somehow having bad luck with every roommate I take on.


My nerves are fried, its been a rough semester, and roommate is moving out. No friends are looking for a room, and the thought of finding someone on craigslist or the like (i.e. a stranger) is terrifying to me. I dont know if thats anxiety speaking, or just general human need for not wanting a stranger all up in their shit 24/7, having access to pretty much all your stuff, or even scarier, bringing guests you dont know into your home. Sharing a shower/bathroom space with someone (esp the opposite sex) is stressful to me, especially in mornings when schedules are similar and we are both in and out. Not to mention some things that are up to the leaser to fix (some tile in the bathroom, fridge without many shelves, wonky shower mechanism, washer and dryer that act up unless they are on the right setting) just normal house quirks, that I feel like a stranger paying for the space would be like ""hey its your job to make sure this thing acts like a reasonable thing or else fix it"", which is totally fair, just not stuff I have the cash to work on right now.


Problem is I need the extra $400 or so to keep the place afloat, and the working situation is pretty thin and sporadic since Im a full time student getting my butt kicked to make As and Bs in my program. The obvious answer is to schlepp a stranger in there, but my area is pretty suburban/rural so most of my options are strangely- illiterate divorcee dads, according to the online resources like craigslist and the like. Not really my scene, even if I didnt have anxiety about randos in my safe space.


Live in boyfriend is getting a second job, but hes also in school full time, so we were trying to think of alternatives because we honestly dont need that room. I was looking at places where you could list your space for storage, but that did not seem like a reliable way to get income. Id rather not sell the place as I bought it foreclosed and its for the most part very affordable for two students, we just need a little bump in income somehow, and the room is going to be empty. Sorry if this sounded... whiney? Im stressed and sensitive and maybe feeling a little entitled by not feeling able to deal with a roommate, so I apologize if this comes off bad.

I'm a 25 year old single dude, working as a federal consultant (salary~ 65k), living at home with my parents in the DC area and my parents and I have been exploring options to move me out of the home and into the wild. My parents' collective salary is around 250k and they've been talking to me lately about being open to co-signing on a loan to purchase a townhouse or condo. Our current home is completely paid off with no plans to move,and my parents live a pretty spartan life style (a life style I have copied, saved about 40k after my first year of work, drive a paid off car, party at most once a month, eat most meals in, no loans) and so I would say my parents are pretty financially stable. They are looking into homes in the 400k-500k area.


Is this a good or bad idea? I'm not leaning any particular way, but I do know that this sub warns heavily against co-signs on loans, however on this occasion it is a cosign by my parents and they are relatively young (mid 50s), we have a great parent/child relationship (lol), and they expect to work for another 10 or so years with no plans to leave the area due to all our extended family living here. I also plan on living with 2-3 other friends in a townhouse to help with the monthly payments.

I have an important question that will likely define my spending/saving habits for the foreseeable future (sad to say, but true).  

I will be graduating from a graduate program in December with around 80k in student loan debt.  It's not pretty, but here I am.  It's not an especially high earning degree, as it prepares me to work in a public service role.  However, the other side to that coin is that if, after ten years in a public service role, I have not missed any of the minimum monthly payments, the remainder will be forgiven (~~on which I will have to pay taxes during the year in which the amount was forgiven~~).  My interest rate is right around 5%.  Assuming I have a starting salary around 40k, and I will conservatively be making 60-65k in ten years time, what is the better repayment option?

Either:
a) Pay the loans down as fast as possible.  With the help of my wife's income, I could likely pay down the loan amount in 6-8 years, but I would have minimal savings to show right around the time we are starting a family (which scares me), or
b) Pay the minimum amount each month, let the interest rack up, save as much as possible, and let the loans be forgiven after 120 payments.

If my government just so happens to sponsor legislation enabling me to take advantage of some benefits offered to those in my chosen career path, you can be god damned right I'm going to take advantage of them.  Your attempts to guilt me into repaying have exactly no weight in my decision to the proposed situation.  Call me entitled, call me lazy, I don't care.  I am entering the most important professional years of my life in the midst of an economy that damn near requires me to have one, if not multiple college degrees before I can even hope for a decent level of success. 

Lastly, there seems to be some confusion as to my long-term professional intent.  I will work in the public sector my whole professional life.  That is the career I have chosen for myself.  Yes, I know it means less money.  Yes, I know I am ""wasting earning potential"".  I live simply.  My wife and I have devoted ourselves to lives of service to our community.  We are happy doing so.  I live in one of the last states to offer pension to public service roles, so spare me the talk about needing $XXX amount in order to retire comfortably.",finance,1430234658

investing,NFLX- A Burdened Bloat (SELL),"On April 16, 2015, news broke that Netflix (NFLX), streaming media giant, surpassed CBS (CBS) in market capitalization, a sign of rapid growth in a company that four-years prior had been considered dead due to a failed spin-off deal .  With reports that the revenue and net income of Netflix, essential for a growth stock such as this particular, increased to substantial levels, many purchased shares in the company, thereby pushing 

Lost in all of the mania that seems to befall institutional investors and their individual clients is that, while it is true that the company has grown in the past decade, the rapidity of the stock has grown at an even faster rate, propelling the stock to levels not seen since the days of AOL and Yahoo a generation prior.  If the price had grown at a modest pace, investing long-term into Netflix would have been a sound and rational move.  However, at the current price of $571.55, as of April 17, 2015, the value of Netflix is too high.  

To start, it is important to note that in the world of investing, nearly any stock is worth some sort of price.  The question most investors should ask in a two-part process is: what is the value of the company, and is the current price trading at a bargain of the value?  

Currently, as of April 18, 2015, the share price of Netflix was $571.55.  With an earnings of $4.32, the P/E ratio of Netflix was 132.30, an astonishing number in a comparatively high, but modest (compared to 1999), market. With a book value per share of 30.75, the P/B ratio of Netflix was 18.10.  From the get go, compared to the S&amp;P 500, which possesses a P/E ratio of 20.34, and a P/B ratio of 2.82, Netflix is an overvalued stock.  It is true that in the short-run, Netflix may seem like an undervalued stock due to the market’s psychological need for purchasing shares of technology stocks during times of economic boom.  However, as a long-term stock, the purchasing price currently imposed to potential investors is one that is too high.  

To start with, rather than establishing a monopoly over other technologies, thereby increasing the worth of the brand, Netflix is becoming more-and-more dependent on other technologies and brands, thereby putting the blossoming companies life in the hands of other, more advantageous, ones.  

Gradually, as time went on, more-and-more emphasis was placed on streaming over DVD-by-mail membership services. In the 2014 10-K of Netflix, the company reported a decrease in American DVD revenues, stemming from a 16 percent decrease in DVD paid memberships.  Interestingly enough – one that should raise a red flag for investors – is that despite a clear decrease in the revenues of DVD membership, the company added $71.49 million in amortization of DVD content library, compared to $71.33 million in 2013. While it is sensible that amortization of streaming content library increased in 2014 compared to 2013, this was due to an increase in subscribers for the streaming section of Netflix. 

Ironically, one of the boasting points behind Netflix and their rising stock, one involving additional cash, hurts the company due to the method to which they obtain said monetary funds. In the 2014 10-K, Netflix reported that they earned an additional $408.1 million compared to 2013 ($1.6085 billion in 2014 vs. $1.2004 billion in 2013).  At first, this sounds astonishing considering that Netflix in 2012 possessed $748.1 million in cash.  In other words, in a mere two full years of business, Netflix was able to double their cash holdings.  However, during these two years, Netflix issued heavy debt in the form of convertible bonds and high-yield fixed income notes.  By issuing 8.5 percent bonds, Netflix issued corporate bonds on par with amounts one can generally expect from casino companies.  While Netflix has additional cash, the same company also has additional debt, which must be paid off through either interest or conversion into common stock.  

With regards to short-term investments, Netflix is also hurting their long-term value of current assets. Netflix has $111.76 million in money-market funds and $3.6 million in CD’s, ones that could potentially yield a lower rate than the U.S. interest rate.  In other words, once Netflix pulls out their money from a money market fund, they will find that said money is worth less than when they put their money in the fund.  Netflix has $295.50 million in corporate bonds, and $168.75 million in Government bonds.  Although these bring higher-yield than money market funds and CD’s, many of the corporate bonds fail to have a steady risk-to-return ratio; and in the case of American Government bonds, while the risk is lower, so is the return.  

It is important for Netflix to use their short-term cash because in their 2014 10-K, Netflix announced that they had a negative cash flow of $126.70 million.  Compared to 2013, Netflix in 2014 lost $81.3 million in cash from operating activities due to attempting to purchasing content for their subscribers.  Further hampered by purchasing $69.72 million in property and equipment, Netflix in 2014 had a Non-GAAP FCF of -$126.70 million. In other words, Netflix has no spare money to pay off future debts from the bonds that the company has issued out in recent years.  This puts Netflix in a pickle. Since Netflix does not have any cash to expand, it must issue debt.   However, while in the short-term, Netflix has cash to expand internationally and domestically, it must pay off their debt with future cash flow.  This is problematic, since Netflix does not have any positive cash flow.  Thus, to survive, Netflix must incur further debt through bonds in order to expand and pay off past debt.  Netflix has plans to pay $9.8 billion in future streaming content through money that is non-existent.  

The situation involving negative cash flow brings up a delicate situation for Netflix.  The streaming-media giant is one that uses Amazon Web Services in order to receive essential services, such as data processing, storage capabilities, and cloud computing software and hardware.  In order for Netflix to switch over to their own home-grown service, the company would have to temporarily suspend operations since their entire operations involves computing systems.  This creates a snowball effect of losing customers, revenue, net income, share price, and market capitalization. Furthermore, by depending on a rival streaming service for the maintenance of their service, it would be equivalent to RCA (Radio) depending on Consolidated Edison (ED) towards the development of radio stations during the 1920’s, or Yahoo depending on AOL during the 1990’s.  Netflix attempts to quell the weariness of investors by assuring them that Amazon will not strike against the company, noting that, “while the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service.”  However, Netflix cannot be fully sure of this, especially since Amazon’s streaming service is supplemented by their Prime service.  If Amazon was to offer a subscription service that competed with Netflix, to further enhance their competitive nature, Amazon could remove Netflix’s service, thereby ruining the media-streaming giant. 

Coincidentally, by gaining a dependence on Amazon in terms of software and hardware, Netflix is also dependent on Amazon in the investment market. If Amazon was to decrease tremendously in value, the stock’s decline would influence Netflix to decline in value as well.  Likewise, by being dependent on Netflix as a source of revenue, the decline of Netflix would mean the decline of Amazon’s market capitalization.   These proposition, mind the reader, are a long-term one and not a short-term one.  Despite the rapid short-term fluctuations of Amazon’s stock, stemming from a loss in earnings, Netflix is steadily rising in price. 

Historically, the connection between Netflix and Amazon is not new.  In the previous generation, when the dot-com bubble reached massive proportions, one would see a similar connection with AOL and other internet companies. During this time, AOL looked for additional streams of revenue in the form of advertising.  Meanwhile, burgeoning internet companies were looking for advertising that would increase their viewings, thereby increasing their share price in the form of irrational exuberance. By brokering a deal between Pets.com and AOL, for example, a dependence was set.  The survival of Pets.com depended on AOL using ad space for the pet-oriented company.  Meanwhile, AOL was dependent on the canine-friendly brand as a source of revenue, which at the time was the main factor in investment by speculators on the market.  If AOL decided to take away the ad space of Pets.com, for example, and replace the ad with an ad for Priceline.com, Pets.com would have lost an important stream of profit, thus killing the company.  Likewise, if AOL abandoned their arrangement with Pets.com, the founder of “You Got Mail” would lose revenue, thereby losing a part of their bottom line. 

TL;DR:  The company is too bloated with debt and overvaluation that the company should not be bought.  Sell now and reap your rewards. 

Critics of the proposition argue that unlike Pets.com, Netflix is “too big to fail.”  However, in the previous example, one must note that AOL, a much larger company during their heyday, collapsed under the circumstance of being too dependent on other companies as a source of success. AOL depended on smaller internet companies with their gullibility as a source of revenue.  When AOL lost these companies due to the early stages of the dot-com bubble bursting, AOL lost revenue, creating a snowball effect that eventually led to the demise of the company in its’ original form. 

In short, Netflix is a fundamentally unsound company.  Like many technological companies that have come before Netflix, the media streaming organization is stuck in a rut.  Speculators purchase the stock due to perceived unlimited upside potential in the future.  In the short-term, the company is valued higher than CBS because of the rapid growth in the company.  However, because Netflix is starting to lose money despite gaining money, Netflix as a large brand will eventually shrink in size, both in price and value, when the next correction occurs.  This is important, since the goal of our research team is to make sure that we do not purchase at an overvalued price.",finance,1430236149
personalfinance,Help With Tax Considerations and Vanguard Funds,"Hello everyone, 

I have a particular question that I wanted to ask everyone, regarding taxes vs. expense ratios vs. earnings.

I am in the 33% tax bracket, federally. I live in a state with no income tax. My ""unearned income"" is all the income I have and does not qualify for any 401k,IRA,Roth, etc. 

My question is: Which Vanguard fund would be best for my tax situation? If I own a fund that pays regular dividends, then I am hit with my qualified dividend tax rate on those dividends each quarter. However, if I own a fund that focuses on capital appreciation (and little to no dividends), I wouldn't get hit with taxes until I sell. However, the expense ratio for the tax managed funds are over twice as much!

Vanguard Total Stock Index Admiral expense is .05% VS. Vanguard Tax Managed Capital Appreciation fund is .12%. Difference over 30 years is 13,340.55 dollars with initial investment at 120K, investment return 6%. That is a lot of moneyover that period. I wonder if its better to just go with the Vanguard Total Stock Index.

Seems like a common growth fund (large) is

personalfinance,"Having to pay to work (aspiring realtor), while only having limited funds to start with. Is this possible?","Long story short, I have made some financial ""mistakes"" over the last few years. I had a cushy job and a one bedroom apartment all to myself. I was also going to school part time at a community college, using federal and state grants to pay my meager tuition. At this point, I had nearly $10,000 in personal savings.

My car was dying; I needed to buy a new one, which thankfully only cost me about $3,500 from said savings account. I then, stupidly, decided to upend my life, quit my job, and transferred to a local 4-year university as a full-time student (after having graduated from community college with an Associate's Degree), while still living alone. I got a job waiting tables, which didn't last long due to various stressors, and I quit after securing a loan from my grandparents (a whole other story in and of itself) to cover my living expenses until the end of that semester (roughly 3 months).

The end of the semester came and went and I was still unable to find a job. By the time I did, I'd exhausted that loan as well as the majority of my savings account. The job that I secured was dreadful ($5/hr + tips, which typically amounted to less than $15 a day). I have since bounced around to a few different jobs, most of them not paying well at all, until I most recently landed one as a bartender. The money is far better, but I'm still struggling to be able to put anything away at the end of the month.

I'm currently living with my boyfriend, and have been for the last 2 years. We typically split expenses based on monthly income, which relieves some stress on my end, but I'm still struggling to hole any money away at the end of every month. And it's certainly not as though we live extravagantly; 99% of the time we cook meals at home, we rarely go out, and typically spend most of our time not at work watching Netflix and/or studying.

This is what brings me to my actual question. I have most recently returned to community college, having realized that there was very little that my previously-attended 4-year university could offer me other than mountains of debt, and am just now wrapping up real estate classes. I have gotten straight A's in this course and have already made connections with several brokerages, and have even had some ""interviews"" with managers of said offices. Basically, at this point, all I have to do is finish up these last few weeks of classes, pass my licensing exam, and pick which company I'd like to work for.

The big downside here is that, having met with some of these office managers, I've learned that there's a fair bit of money that needs to be sunk into one's realtor career before it even begins, as most realtors with these firms are considered independent contractors as opposed to employees. As such, one needs to pay for their license (once the exam has been passed), pay for ""errors and omissions"" (basically insurance through the brokerage firm, which is due annually), pay for access to the MLS website (the listing service used by realtors), and also pay to join a Board of Realtors (national or state).

Most of these fees are prorated, but it's still quite a chunk of change for someone who barely has $500 in her savings account.

I'm very excited to start this career; I feel as though it will be a good fit for me and my personality, however these present financial issues are a major stumbling block.

I'm not sure if there is any advice that can be given for this situation, but I can feel the anxiety swelling up more and more as the end of these classes draws near and I need to vent. Real estate is a business in which I believe I can excel, but I don't even know if I can afford to get started, and that is quite a crushing blow.",finance,1430244742

I'll try to make this as succinct as possible.

* Married couple, filing jointly, just under 30. No kids yet.
* $151k 2014 AGI, will be $200k+ in the next few years
* $100k net worth as couple, doing fine with retirement accounts (contributing to 401(k), Roth IRA, trad. IRA)
* Have solid emergency fund, continuing to contribute
* Credit card debt ($4k) will be paid off in June of this year

Currently after all expenses, saving about $2k a month towards a house down payment ($120k-$150k goal, currently at around $30k).

Wife has $40k in student loans at 6.625%. Currently on graduated repayment plan (only like $227 a month right now). She is currently eligible for PSLF, not sure if that's going to continue to be valid, don't know all the details about it.

To further confuse, we end up with two large chunks of post-tax cash each year outside our current income: a potential $15k-$20k bonus from my job, and $14k gifted from family towards house purchase.

Part of me wants to use those large lump sumps to throw at the student loans to be 100% debt free in a year or two. But that will push off our house plans for a few more years as well. A house is our first priority once our CC debt is gone. 

Balancing long-term vs. short-term, should we be changing our student loan repayment to a more aggressive option? 

Is it worth it? Should we switch our sights towards the student loan debt? Continue to pay minimum and not worry about it? Refinance the student loans for a lower interest rate (voiding PSLF eligibility)?

I worry our eagerness for our house is short-sighted and we will regret the student loan situation once the payments ramp up and the interest is accumulating.

personalfinance,"I'm stuck with $1,900 worth of Visa gift cards","TL;DR: I tried to pay off debt and get airline miles at the same time by buying $1,900 worth of Visa gift cards, when it turns out they weren't accepted by any of my banks for debt payment.

This is a bit of a long story, but here it goes. I racked up a $1,900 balance on a Coastal Federal Credit Union credit card from buying new clothes for a new job. This isn't a problem now because I have already paid off this balance. The problem lies in what I did to attempt to pay it off.

I also had just received my Citi AAdvantage MasterCard, which stipulates that in order to receive 30,000 airline miles, I need to spend $3,000 in the first 2 months. Great! I can use this new card to pay off the debt on my old one.

So, I call up Citi and ask if they could do a balance transfer. Off-handedly, I ask if the balance transfer would count towards my airline miles and the rep said no. I then asked him if I buying Visa gift cards with the credit card would count towards the miles and he said yes.

So, I hung up with him before making any changes and called up Coastal FCU and asked if they would accept Visa gift cards for debt payment. They told me on the phone, ""As long as they have a 16-digit card #, an expiration date, and a CVV security code we should be able to accept them."" Awesome! I walked down to my local CVS and picked up $1,900 worth of OneVanilla Prepaid Visa Cards (the cashier looked at me like I was insane, rightly so). I ended up with 3 cards with $500 each, and 1 card with $400. I then proceeded to call Coastal to make the payment as soon as I got home.

I began to attempt the transaction and I was told that none of my cards were accepted, so apparently I was misinformed. Visa gift cards are not legal tender when it comes to repaying debts at this bank. No worries, though, because I suppose I can just use the cards to pay back the debt on the Citi credit card.

I went to my local Citi branch today and attempted to use them to pay off the debt, but to no avail. So, I am now stuck with $1,900 in Visa gift cards, and I can't use them to pay off any debts. My question is, is there any way to get these back into a bank account so I don't have to do the gift card version of stuffing cash in my mattress?

* An unsung hero makes its last voyage

The last days of the Sturgis may herald a new dawn for floating nuclear plants, writes Will Davis.

When on the morning of 16 April, a set of tugboats surrounded and slowly moved off from the James River Reserve Fleet a long-silent, if well-kept vessel, there were no ceremonies, no fanfare, no water cannon salutes. There were a couple of informal photographs taken, but the final chapter in the life of the world's first floating nuclear power plant began almost without notice on that bright, clear day.

Officially known as MH-1A, the vessel was named Sturgis, after General Samuel D Sturgis, Jr.

personalfinance,Graduating soon!,"Hello all,

My background, I'm graduating debt free with a double major (Finance and Accounting). I have a corporate finance job lined up that will pay $55,000 per year. My fiance makes about the same. Bringing our combined pretax income to $110,000. Soon we will be filing jointly at the 25% federal tax bracket plus about 9.8% state income tax. Neither of us have college loans and we have a combined $45,000 in savings.

I am wondering if we should be looking for a living situation (such as my parents basement) that would allow us to stockpile cash piles until we have enough to build our first dream home. I understand that there is a tax incentive to pay interest BUT there is no tax incentive on the peace of mind that comes with home OWNERSHIP. I would however finance the land on a 30 year note so I could get some sort of advantage. That would likely be $150,000 at 4%. Once I had enough cash to build the custom home (about $80 per sq ft in my area) I would save a little extra and put a down payment on a house, large (down payment that is) enough to put my monthly obligations well under the market rent for the area, move into the house while mine is being built, and then rent it out when my house is move in ready.

Is this realistic? Am I crazy for wanting my networth tied up in real estate? I am foregoing too much of the future value of what I spent on the house that could have been made in the stock market?

First, I'm sorry. I can probably read other posts (which I haven't), but I'd like to just take the easy way out and start a new discussion related to me.

I am a lawyer in my third year of practice. I have a very good job because I practice in an extraordinarily specialized area of the law. My salary mentioned in the title is expected to increase by approximately $20,000 per year.

A distant family member of mine passed away recently and did not leave issue. Accordingly, I will inherit the amount mentioned in the title within sixty days. Those assets will be received by me tax free.

I have a Roth IRA valued at approximately $60,000, but I am unhappy with the management fees being charged.

I graduated from school with approximately $150,000 of debt at an effective interest rate of about 7%. Because I figured that no reasonable investment could outperform the interest, I have aggressively shoveled everything I earn (less expenses), plus some savings I had, towards that. Currently, the loan balance is $48,000.

My rent is $1500 per month. My credit card bill is $1,000 per month. My car is $500 per month (including insurance). I am unmarried, and I have no children. 

Other than what is mentioned above, I have no other (major) assets or liabilities whatsoever.

I would greatly appreciate advice (including advice related to relevant reading material) with respect to crafting a financial investment plan based upon the above. Considering my perceived stability of an income stream, I am also open to the idea of long-term illiquid investments and advice related to insurance products (as I anticipate having a family someday).

personalfinance,"Got into a situation where I'm borderline house-poor. I've a few options but would love your insight. (Austin, TX)","Thanks in advance for reading. I'm going to try to make this as short as possible. A few years ago my employer downsized significantly and I was laid off. It didn't take me much time to find new employment but my pay was almost cut in half (went from 80K to 45K.) I was hoping it would be temporary but unfortunately I haven't been able to find a job yet that gets me back up to that level of pay.

I probably should have taken more drastic action sooner, but here we are. In the meantime I have gotten up to making about 50k, but the savings account has been pretty much drained, and while we keep to a budget that's tight as a drum and all the bills are getting paid, there's really nothing left to go into savings or emergency fund. We are pretty much paycheck to paycheck. 

My wife stays home with the kids and doesn't have a college degree, so any job she could get at this point wouldn't even cover childcare expenses, so that option is out. We have cut out as much unnecessary spending as possible. Dropped cable and only watch Netflix or over-the-air TV. Dropped our cell phone bill from almost $300 down to $160. Never go out to eat anymore. I take all my lunches to work from home, etc. My truck is paid for, my wife's SUV has a $250 payment on it but that will be paid off in less than a year even just making minimum payments. 

What I'm getting at is there is almost nothing left to cut out of my budget and my house payment takes up a little less than half of my take home pay. With no emergency fund, if something major were to happen like a severe plumbing issue that's not covered by insurance, I'm pretty financially screwed. My ""emergency fund"" is my credit card.

I figure I basically have two options. Option 1: I need to bite the bullet and sell the house. Refinancing isn't really an option because my interest rate is only 3.5%. The only problem is that the rental market is terrible due to the massive population boom, so I honestly can't find a rental situation that is significantly cheaper than my current mortgage payment that isn't a dump in a not-so-safe part of town. I've looked for less expensive houses to purchase but they typically, likewise, are not in a place I would consider safe.

Option 2: I get a part time second job and work 55-60 hours a week. If I'm lucky I can hopefully earn an extra 10-15K a year and be able to build back up that safety net and savings. 

I'm willing to consider any other options as well, but so far these are the only two that seem plausible. Let me know if there's any further info to add to this that would be helpful.

**TL;DR:** Due to layoff I am now just barely able to afford my house and bills, probably need to either sell it or get a second job, but maybe you have a better suggestion.

personalfinance,Really quick and hopefully easy question about how to apply student loan payments,"I'm currently in the grace period of my student loans. My total principal is $20,500, and I've accrued about $3,200 of interest so far.

* Loan 1: $3,500 principal, $1,070 accrued interest, 6.8% interest rate
* Loan 2: $2,000 principal, $611 accrued interest, 6.8% interest rate
* Loan 3: $2,986 principal, $710 accrued interest, 6.8% interest rate
* Loan 4: $2,000 principal, $475 accrued interest, 6.8% interest rate
* Loan 5: $2,514 principal, $0 accrued interest (subsidized), 3.4% interest rate
* Loan 6: $3,713 principal, $214 accrued interest, 3.86% interest rate
* Loan 7: $2,000 principal, $115 accrued interest, 3.86% interest rate
* Loan 8: $1,787 principal, $25 accrued interest, 3.86% interest rate

My original goal was to pay off all ~$3,200 of interest before the interest compounds on June 12th. I've got the budget available to do it, but now I'm wondering if that's the best option.

**When paying these loans, is it better to pay off all the interest on each loan first, and then pay off the principal on each one? Or is it better to pay off each of those loans (interest and principal) individually? Or does it not make much of a difference?**

My instinct was to pay off all the interest first, but now I'm wondering if it may be worth it to leave some lower-rate interest unpaid on June 12th, to lower the principal of the higher interest loans further.

I look forward to doing it every other week and look at it almost every day.  Here's a screenshot with an explanation below. http://imgur.com/zDnp7Bp

The day after every paycheck (to allow time to clear) I update an excel spreadsheet that has the balances of all my loans, checking accounts, 401k etc.  It's nice because it has all my personal finance information (interest rates, CC limits, minimum payments, etc) all in one place.  Every new entry I just insert a column so I can see a history of my previous account balances.  It also performs some nifty calculations such as my total debt, my net worth, how much my debt/net worth have changed since last paycheck, and a running average of these values.  Using the averages I calculate when it is projected for my debt to be paid off and my net worth to be positive.

Obviously, I make the minimum payment on my loans, but also every time I update this spreadsheet if my checking account balance minus my CC debt (which I pay off in full before each billing cycle to avoid interest) is above 5k (my personal cushion level), any amount over 5k I put towards the loan with the highest interest rate.

I'm excited for when the average is heavily weighted and doesn't fluctuate much, my average change in net worth theoretically should increase exponentially.  Considering every month I'm paying less in loan interest and I am gaining more interest on my 401k.  Also, the annual raise of my job as well...

The project underlines BP’s commitment to the Egyptian market and is a vote of confidence in Egypt’s investment climate and economic potential.

Production from WND is expected to reach up to 1.2 billion cubic feet a day (bcf/d), equivalent to about 25 per cent of Egypt’s current gas production and significantly contribute to increasing the supply of energy in Egypt. All the produced gas will be fed into the country’s national gas grid, helping to meet the anticipated growth in local demand for energy. Production is expected to start in 2017.

“BP is proud of its record in Egypt over the past 50 years and we are looking forward to many more years in the country. The WND project investment is the largest foreign direct investment in Egypt, and demonstrates our continued confidence in Egypt and our commitment to unlock its energy potential. WND production is key to Egypt’s energy security,” said Bob Dudley, [BP Group](http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate.html) Chief Executive.

Gas will be produced from two BP-operated offshore concession blocks, North Alexandria and West Mediterranean Deepwater. BP believes that there is the potential through future exploration to add a further 5-7 tcf which could boost WND production with additional investments.

Commenting on the project, Hesham Mekawi, BP North Africa Regional President said, “This is a critical milestone in the Egyptian oil and gas history. It marks the start of a major national project to add significant production to the domestic market. BP expects to double its current gas supply to the Egyptian domestic market during this decade when the WND project reaches its peak production. BP will also continue to invest in our existing oil operations at the Gulf of Suez (through GUPCO) and gas operations in the East Nile Delta (through Pharaonic Petroleum Co.), as well as progressing our recently discovered resources to allow for the next new major development after WND.”

The scale of investment and activities of the WND project are expected to significantly contribute to the growth of petroleum-related industries and to Egyptian employment. During the construction phase, the project is projected to employ thousands of direct and indirect personnel. In line with BP’s commitment to support the development of Egyptian capability, the WND project will encourage technology transfer and know-how through training and on-the-job development. This will help to create strategic national capabilities to unlock the country’s future hydrocarbon potential.

As part of the WND project, BP will also undertake a social investment programme directed to various sustainable development projects in coordination with the local communities and utilizing local service providers.

This will be in addition to the project’s principal approach, which is focused on increasing local labour, with a commitment to employ significant local labour during operations.

**Notes to editors**

The West Nile Delta (WND) Major Project is a strategic project for BP where BP has about 65 per cent equity in the project partnership.
The WND project concept maximises the utilisation of existing infrastructure:
BP-operated Taurus/Libra fields: this will be a subsea development tied-in offshore to existing BG-operated Burullus facilities
The BP-operated Giza/Fayoum &amp; Raven fields: These are two deepwater long distance tie-backs to the shore, where the existing Rosetta plant will be modified for Giza/Fayoum and integrated with a new adjacent onshore plant for Raven.
BP has a long and successful track record in Egypt stretching back 50 years with investments exceeding $25 billion, making BP one of the largest foreign investors in the country. In Egypt, BP’s business is primarily in oil and gas exploration and production.
BP has made a series of discoveries in Egypt in recent years including Taurt North, Seth South and Salmon and Rahamat, Satis, Hodoa, Notus and Salamat.
To date, BP Egypt, in collaboration with the Gulf of Suez Petroleum Company (GUPCO), BP’s joint venture (JV) Company with the Egyptian General Petroleum Company (EGPC), has produced almost 40 per cent of Egypt’s entire oil production, and currently produces almost 10 per cent of Egypt’s annual oil and condensate.
In addition, through joint ventures with EGPC/EGAS and IEOC (ENI) the Pharaonic Petroleum Company (PhPC) and Petrobel BP currently produces close to 30 per cent of Egypt's total gas.
BP is working to meet Egypt’s domestic market growth by actively exploring in the Nile Delta and investing to add production from existing discoveries.
BP is a 33 per cent shareholder of an NGL plant extracting LPG and propane, United Gas Derivatives Company (UGDC) in partnership with ENI/IEOC and GASCO (the Egyptian midstream gas distribution company).
BP is also present in the downstream sector through Natural Gas Vehicles Company (NGVC, BP 40 per cent) which was established in September 1995 as the first company in Africa and the Middle East to commercialize natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicles.

M) Currently I bring in $2,400/ mo net between working a banking day job and teaching music lessons in the evenings/ weekends. I have approx. $150k in student loan debt for my 4yr undergrad where I received my BA in Music. Here is a mock budget I made, using the Pear Budget which allocates your money into three categories:
Regular, Irregular, and Variable Expenses. 

***Regular Expenses:***

Rent ~ $650

Utilities ~ $125

Auto Insurance $142

Fed Student Loan $328

Perkins Student Loan $60

Great Lakes Private Loan $0

Emerg. Savings $350

Gifts $20


TOTAL: $120

***Variable Expenses***

Groceries $160

Dining Out $60

Car Gas $120

Drinks $60

Haircuts $20

Misc $100


TOTAL: $535

TOTAL OF ALL EXPENSES: $2,310


TOTAL INCOME: $2,400




The student loan debt can be broken into 3 chunks:



Parent Plus Loan: 100k based off my mom's income and household numbers (brother, sister-in-law, and their baby live w/ mom b/ they have SL debt). Payments are $328/ mo for 120 payments (10 yrs), and then this is forgiven since my mother is a nurse (public service forgiveness). This was 4 loans (one for each year) consolidated into one loan now @ 7.65% interest.




Great Lakes Private: 40k. I signed up for the new ""Pay as you Earn"" program which calculates that based off my day job I qualify for $0.00/ mo. ***My huge question here is about the TAX that I will have to pay back after this is forgiven in 20yrs, if I'm not able to pay it off... How does this work? Should I be making payments towards this? Will this screw me over in 20 years?*** This loan is the total of 9 different direct subsidized (3.8% int) and direct unsubsidized staffords (6.8% int). 




Perkins Loan: 5.5k. This one is $60/ mo - payments till 2032. I'm making minimum payments on this...Should I plan on paying this one off fast too? This loan is @ 5.5% interest.




Let's please not get into ""field"" choices here. I chose to get get my BA in music when I was 17, and I don't regret it. I have over twenty private drum and piano students every week and I just got back from the world championships in percussion, where the high school I tech percussion for made 6th place. I even really love my day job doing financial data entry/ analysis because it is giving me a career to grow in. 




I just wish I knew exactly how much I would be paying back BEFORE I took out loans for my education. I wish I had some form of financial literacy before I took out these loans. I did NOT expect to have as much debt as I have, however I'm working as hard as I can to dig myself out. Any advice on how to clean up my budget, and which loans to knock off first and how, is greatly appreciated!

Should I cash in the small amount in my 401k, or leave it alone and finance the ring?","I am a full-time student majoring in engineering, made around 22k last year, and I plan on making close to that this year as well.  I am expecting to graduate May of next year. I was blessed to find the woman of my dreams and plan on proposing at some point this summer. 
I was fortunate enough to work for a company with a small 401k matching program to have approximately 3k fully vested into that account. I also have an account specifically set aside for the ring and to cover the cost difference of school and my federally student loans, about 1500/semester. As a student a majority of my income comes during the summer months and I anticipate this savings set aside to be around 5k by the end of summer (but 3k to be spent on last two semesters of school). These loans will total around 25k upon graduation.  The rings we are looking at are around 5k, and to the best of my knowledge she is going to say yes.  

My question here is this, do I finance the ring, with a hefty down payment, and pay the monthly payments until I graduate then immediately pay off the remaining balance once I am working full-time?
Or, do I sacrifice my 1+ years worth of contributions to the 401k (~3k) along with extra 2k in my savings and pay cash for it?

I never thought financing something would appear to be the better option, but I believe, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that the interest I would pay by financing would not be greater than the financial benefits I gain by keeping my balance in my 401k while continuing to contribute to it.

I had about 25k in the stock market (through RRSPs/inheritance) that we had planned on using to buy a house, but was heavily invested in the Alberta oil and gas market, which has a current value of about 7k (we haven't sold the stocks yet, because I'm pensive about solidifying the loss).

I also owe the government about 17k in back taxes from when I was 19 and stupid that I cannot get forgiveness for. They garnish 1/3 of my after-tax wages but my employers help me out by giving me advances in full and only deducting the 1/3 from the amount I am paid at the end of the month.

We're making a combined net income of about 3800 and we end the month with about 800 after paying standard loans, rent, utilities, gas and insurance, food, entertainment, etc. ( I have a pretty strict budget).

1. If I plan on going back to school, should I bother paying down any extra towards my student loans if I intend on taking more to pay for graduate studies?

2. Is it a better idea to liquidate our stock and simply pay off the debt to the government or should we hold on to those assets assuming that they will rebound in the next 3-5 years and earn us an additional 18k (which is about 12k more than we would pay in interest on the CRA debt)?

personalfinance,Help me be the best grandson I can be,"Throwaway to protect privacy. I'm a frequent /r/personalfinance reader, and a veteran of Reddit at large.

**Background:**

My grandmother (now 75 years old) received a life insurance settlement when my grandfather passed away 7 years ago. They didn't have very much money during their life, and my grandmother never had to manage household finances before. So she was totally unprepared for it.

I recently returned the states from overseas, and I was horrified to find out how haphazardly my grandmother's finances were being managed. There was no financial planning, very little consideration to how money was spent, and using what instruments.



**Beginning State:**

My grandmother had bought a house, given away large lump sums of cash to family members, invested the remaining balance of her finances with a financial planner that she had almost no contact with, and just generally didn't know what was going on.

**Financial details:**

Credits:


* Total monthly income from retirement accounts: $2916
* Current monthly withdrawal from investment account: $1200

Debits:

* Mortgage: $945 (7 years into 30yr fixed @ 4.75%)
* Other non-discretionary spending: $755 (rolling 6 month average)
* Discretionary spending: $2400 (rolling 6 month average)

Assets:

* Above water in house after 7 years (Market value &gt; down payment + payoff).
* Investment account being managed by Financial advisor: $220,000 (non-liquid balance)


**Steps I've already taken:**

* I moved my grandmother's daily spending to an AMEX Blue Cash card. This rewards program provided the best reward for her spending categories. I also moved all of her outstanding credit card debt (no one had ever explained to her that she shouldn't ever pay interest), to the new card at 0% for 18mos. Previously she was spending entirely out of a debit card account, where she was keeping a totally unnecessary cash balance. 
* I automated all of her bill payments. No more mailed checks!
* I re-negotiated all of her accounts that could be negotiated (insurance, cable, cellphone, etc). She is no longer massively overpaying for all of her services.
* I closed extra lines of credit (particularly department store lines of credit) that were opened, used once, and then forgotten about. 
* I reviewed the terms of her mortgage and checked with re-finance experts that have advised that there is no need or benefit to restructuring her mortgage. 

**Things for which I need your help:**

1. Her financial advisor has her invested using an Ameritrade account, the bulk of her investments are spread across DFA equities. The account seems to be very passively managed (not very much activity, which is probably normal for retirement accounts). The financial advisor charges over $3500 per year (I have no idea where this falls on the spectrum). Over the past 6 years, he's never had a year better than 4% ROI and averages around 2% yearly. Because my grandmother withdraws about 5-6% per year, I need to know if this is normal, bad, good?

2. Medical/Life insurance... My grandmother has a Blue Cross/Blue shield policy from my grandfather's retirement benefits (he was a federal government employee), but did not sign up for any Medicare when it became available. She also has no life insurance policies so far as I can tell. I've done a fair bit of research, but haven't really been able to come any conclusions about if she needs more insurance.

3. Taxes... My grandmother has owed taxes for the past 7 years... It's approximately $1500 per year. Any advice on if this seems high/normal/low would be greatly appreciated

4. Anything else /r/personalfinance can think of... I would be very grateful.


I love my grandmother more than anything. I want to make sure that she is comfortable, and never has to worry about any financial matters. I will only be in the states for a short while, so I would like to help her organize as much as I possibly can before I move again. 

Thank you in advance, if there is any additional information I can provide, please let me know.",finance,1430330833

personalfinance,I am 20 years old and about to make more money than I know how to manage. I am extremely nervous right now and would appreciate any guidance.,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I am posting from an alternate account for reasons that will be obvious. I am 20 years old and currently in college pursuing a degree in engineering. In the summer after I graduated high school, I started working on an idea that I had, that turned into a serious pursuit pretty quickly. I worked on it more through my first year of college, and actually wound up taking a semester off this year to develop it even further and look for venture capital funding to start a real company. We didn't get very far before there was interest from a large technology company in fully acquiring the company and our patents/technology (when I say we, I really just mean myself and my best friend, who started working with me around a year ago).

After a lot of consideration, I decided that I was okay with selling them what I had worked on for so long. I had some really good legal help and last week we reached an agreement for them to acquire us. I can't give many more details due to the NDA, but I am going to be getting around $2.5 million from the deal. Most is in stock of the parent company, but around 35% is cash. And I haven't the slightest clue what to do now.

I don't know anything about managing a stock portfolio, or investing, or anything. I have a few thousand dollars in federal student loans, but beyond that I don't have any debt or legal fees from the negotiations. My plan is to continue and finish my degree. I want to make sure that my younger brothers have the money they need to go to college. Beyond that, I have absolutely no idea how to proceed. I want to figure out how to best manage this for the future, but I feel very overwhelmed by everything at once. I was always a technical person and didn't care much for finances. I don't know what to do with the stock they are giving me, or how and if I can sell it, or where I should put any of the rest of this money. It's causing me a great deal of anxiety, and I would really appreciate any guidance here. My guess is that a lot of people are going to doubt this story since I can't provide any proof (doing so would violate the NDA). I am okay with that, but I really need advice here from people who I know won't be trying to take advantage of me. Thanks.

**TL;DR: A large company is buying technology that I developed and I am getting a lot of money from it. I have no idea what to do now and it is really stressing me out.**

personalfinance,Is it a good move to pay off a terrible car loan with a less terrible personal loan?,"As the title says, I have a car loan with a brutal 18.x% interest rate. I have two years left on the loan, with a total balance of about $8,000. I'm not super concerned about the amount of the payments per month, but I am very interested in making sure the payments are going toward the actual loan amount. I'm thinking about a personal loan through Wells Fargo, which shows around a 8.265% (ideal) interest rate. So, it would seem like a good idea to me, money wise, but I am more concerned about what impact it might have on my credit/credit score. I have a 753 transunion, 740 equifax score according to CreditKarma, so I'm hoping I can get at least near the best rates on a personal loan. But, I'm very interested in seeing my credit go up, and I'm already lacking in terms of what kind of accounts I have. I only have this car loan and some credit cards, and I've read that a car loan looks better than a personal loan. Will this have a huge impact on my score going forward? Does this seem like a good idea?

EDIT: some details on the car... it's miserably upside down. I owe 8k on a 2003 model, which is rocking 130k miles. I bought the car used from DriveTime when I was in a bad spot, and they were the ones to help me out. I also had bad bad bad credit at the time I got the vehicle",finance,1430332696
personalfinance,25yo and just defaulted on student loans,"So here's the deal: I owe about $6,000 to the federal government for my student loans. I have been trying to get back on my feet after dropping out of college due to this amount (it stopped me from attending anymore classes, etc.), and was planning on establishing contact with them to pay off the amount. 

But, just recently, I received a letter from a debt collection agency (Allied Interstate). I now owe my remaining debt to them, which includes $1500 in collection charges. 

Now, before I ask for any advice, I would just like to preempt that with the knowledge that I am an idiot. I have been suffering from pretty severe depression over the past couple of years, and have been trying to work my way up to a job decent enough to start paying back what I owed. I thought I could hide from it for a certain time, but I realize what an idiot I was for thinking so. 

So... now that I owe over $7500 to a collection agency for my defaulted student loan, how do I go about this? I was hoping to start paying it off shortly so that I could go back to school to finish my degree, but now my credit is surely in extreme damage. Is there any way out of this mess I've made? Can I offer them a smaller offer on the debt to buy it back? How do I go about this?

personalfinance,Suggestions on tackling debt?,"This one will be a little long winded so bear with me. So I have a little bit of debt. It's really not as much as some that I've seen other people deal with but it still seems like a mountain to me. It makes me anxious and stressed out just thinking about it. I could really use some advice on the best way to handle it.

Basically, I have about $10,000 worth of total combined debt that is kicking my ass. That's because it's mostly all wrapped up in credit cards. I have three actual, physical credit cards and three different in-store credit accounts. The three cards were stupid youthful indiscretions that I opened when I was between the ages of 19-22. More recently, they were used as a crutch when circumstances arose and I had to give up a ton of income. The in-store credit accounts are manageable and were opened for emergency purposes (washing machine broke in my rental house, landlord refused to replace it) and a special occasion (engagement ring). Approximately $9,000 of the $10,000 is credit card debt.

The credit cards are hammering me. The interest rates are surely awful. I'm not sure what they are exactly, because I paid no attention when I was opening the cards. I am also admittedly not the best at juggling all the different payments and due dates, so there have been some late payments. I don't want to hurt my credit score (~680 FICO) any more - I want to build it. I'm growing up and maturing and I still suck at the responsibility thing sometimes. I admit it.

So here's what I'm looking for: what's the best way I can consolidate all this debt into one and therefore buy out all my debt and then only have one payment to make instead of 6? I was thinking about a balance transfer on a new card at first but that doesn't sound like the best idea. I talked to a banker at my local branch over the phone and she recommended a personal loan or line of credit. That way I could pay everyone else and have the convenience of only having to make one payment a month, right from my mobile banking app. That sounds like the best option, but I don't know what the APR's are on things of that nature (though I would assume they are much more reasonable than credit cards). Is there a better option?

Help me out guys, I'm still young (23 now) and I have a lot of time ahead of me to straighten this out. I don't want it to turn into a nightmare - more than it already is.

And lastly, here are my financials:
Salary: $38k base with a ton of OT potentials
Rent: $800/month
Electric/Utilities: Usually about $200/month
Car payment: $130/month
Car insurance: $125/month

I really need some advice regarding saving for retirement/future.
I'm a 32 years old guy living in Guatemala, and, being this a third world country, many things about retirement I've read from books don't apply here.

Everywhere I read and every book talks about IRA and all kinds of sweet retirement plans they offer in the US but where I live they don't have it. So, what to do instead?

In Guatemala, the government takes 5% from your monthly income which goes to social security. This crappy plan is mandatory, and it gives you, when you retire, a very low salary.

The only option is opening a retirement bank account, but the banks here offer like 6.5% interest rate.

personalfinance,What does it mean to me and my situation that so many other people are in bad shape?,"I ask this question regularly and I don’t think I have a good answer.  I wonder what I should be doing to set myself up to win when so many other people are doing it wrong.  Here is what I see:
1)	Many of my friends are up to the ears in debt.  Student debt, car debt, house debt, credit card debt, business debt.  It almost seems like they haven’t encountered a loan they didn’t like.
2)	Many are taking on big life decisions right now.  I’m talking about life changing decisions.  Having babies, buying houses, leasing cars, getting married.  All of this occurring at the same time.  I remember seeing news stories from a couple of years ago saying that many people were putting off these sorts of activities because of the recession and I can believe it.  Now it seems like people can’t get married fast enough.
3)	I still see reports though that few people have enough for retirement and fewer people are even setting aside any money at all.  News stories are being written about boomers having to continue to work into their 80’s because they don’t have enough money to retire on.
4)	With interest rates artificially low now, what will that mean to the economy, the stock market, the housing market, my parent’s retirement, etc?  Does this mean the time of easy money will quickly be behind us?  
I am in a great situation financially.  I have no debt other than my house (15yr mortgage), 6 months of expenses in a savings account, and I am saving for my retirement.  I am in a job where recruiters are calling me regularly to switch companies and I have no worries about being fired.  But I still think to myself what’s next?  I feel lost because I feel there is some opportunity on the horizon but I can’t tell what it is or how I need to prepare myself now to take advantage of it.  
I was really lucky during the Great Recession.  I had just paid off my last debts just before things started going south and I was saving like mad in my retirement.  I know those days of 33% returns are not realistic and may not happen again for a very long time.  I was able to buy my house in 2010 and take advantage of the first time home buyer tax credit.  Since then the value of my property has increased 20% according to a recent appraisal I got when I refinanced my home.  I often joke that I could really use another housing crash since the last one worked out so well for me.
I am just not sure what I need to do to move from being “set” to being far ahead of everyone else.  How do I make my life better knowing that so many other people have no stinking idea what they’re doing?  Markets are cyclical and there will be another crash, but how do I get ready for it?  It seems like everyone is getting greedy and I am feeling very fearful, so what do I do about it?

Okay, these past few years I've been pretty much flat out dumb when it came to budgeting and spending money. I moved out on my own, and being on a high of my new found freedom and not making all that much money, instead of my debt I spent a lot of it on foolish material things.

Now that I'm almost 30, I realize I debt is not going to disappear and  I need to get this under control or I honestly risk working the rest of my life until I literally drop.

Here's a rough breakdown of my debt:

-about $25,000 in private student loans
-about $15,000 in federal student loans
-$1700 medical debt from a hospital stay
-$780 credit card debt

I earn between $860-1,150 every 2 weeks at my job.

Here are my other bills:

-$700 in rent per month. 
-$30-60 electric (heat and hot water are included in rent) per month
-$46 car insurance per month
-$55 internet bill per month
-$65 cell phone bill per month.

I realize that the above bills before my debt take up almost a whole paycheck.
Factoring in gas, groceries, household items, I really have no idea how I'm going to pay down my debt without living off of ramen.

Right now my federal student loans are in a forbearance. My private student loans are interest only (about $65 a month) for the next year or two. I negotiated my medical debt to $45 a month for the next few years.My credit card bill is interest free as long as I pay it off before January. So I can swing it.... for now. 

Any advise would be great. Any good books, way to pay this off faster, etc.. I'm in a debt paying state of mind right now and realize with my income I can't be out buying clothes and partying at bars.

I'm also trying to put money in a savings. Right now I only have $300 in my savings account. It's rough.

With that, I have a very important question....

I have stocks with the company I work for that vest next month. It looks like I will be getting a little over $1000 back in a few weeks when I sell my shares. I want all of that to go to bills but am not sure which ones. I was thinking at first to pay off my credit card bill, but since it's interest free until January I'm not sure if I should do that or apply it to my medical bills. My mom told me I should just put it in my savings.

Bitcoin,A Bitcoin Exchange Traded Note (ETN): Some technical background on ETNs,"As noted [here](http://www.bloomberg.com/research/markets/news/article.asp?docKey=600-201504290300HUGIN___EUPRX____HUG1916185-1), a bitcoin ETN is expected to start trading mid-May.

ETNs are really cool, but kind of complicated, so I thought some background would be helpful.

**What is an ETN?**

Fundamentally, an ETN is a bond (""note"") issued by a financial institution and then traded on an exchange. Like other bonds, it will have a maturity date, an interest rate, and an expected payment at maturity. 

For an ETN that is designed to track the price of another asset or basket of assets, the ETN will generally pay no interest over the course of the bond, but have a redemption value based on the price of the asset it is designed to track. That redemption value will be payable on maturity, and sometimes during a daily redemption as well.

**So it's a derivative?**

Yes! Once live on an exchange, market participants will be trading ownership of a promise from the financial institution to pay them an amount based on the performance of the underlying asset. 

**How does the financial institution issuing the ETN know it can meet its obligation to make payments based on the value of the underlying asset?**

Hedging! Most simply, if the financial institution buys one bitcoin for every time they issue an ETN with a value equal to one bitcoin, they will have a basket of assets with a value that increases and decreases directly in proportion to the value of their obligation to ETN holders. Because of the structure of ETNs and modern regulatory requirements, you take on the credit risk of the financial institution, meaning if they go bankrupt (either because their traders failed in maintaining the hedge or for any number of other reasons), you may not get the amounts owed to you. 

**What other ETNs exist?**

ETNs exist for 'normal' asset classes, like gold and silver and oil, and also for wacky mixes of assets or particular groups of stocks. They're relatively easy to cobble together and market, and fundamentally Wall Street will market anything that can sell, so you see a lot of ETNs given the low barrier to entry. 

**Will this increase demand for bitcoin?**

Yes and no. It's hard to imagine how they hedge the ETN without increasing bitcoin demand - they have to either buy bitcoins or bitcoin futures/options to balance their liabilities. Those markets are immature or technically risky, which is one reason why ETNs haven't come out yet (another being regulatory/compliance issues on the part of the financial institution that would be issuing the ETN - it's not surprising this isn't happening in the U.S.).

So yes, in a round-about way demand for the ETNs *should* cause increased demand for bitcoin proper, as the financial institution's hedge positions are increased (buying bitcoin/bitcoin derivatives) as more ETNs are issued. As demand gets truly large, the financial institution issues new shares (and redeems them as well should the opposite occur). 


**Can't this all go horribly wrong?**

You bet! Here's a fun example of an ETN tied to volatility issued by CS that went haywire: http://www.forbes.com/sites/ariweinberg/2012/04/17/lessons-from-the-tvix-washout/ 

**How is that different from an ETF?**

ETFs generally represent pass-through ownership of the underlying asset. In other words, owning a share of the ETF means owning a slice of the underlying asset purchased by the fund. Theoretically you have no 'credit' exposure to whatever entity issued the ETF. In addition, ETFs have robust arbitrage mechanisms whereby authorized participants can purchase shares of the ETF directly from the fund in exchange for the underlying asset, or vice versa. This means if the ETF diverges materially from the net asset value of the asset it holds, money can be made risk-free by increasing or decreasing the supply of the underlying asset. 

**How is that different from GBTC?**

Unlike an ETF, GBTC shares issued by the fund are subject to a 12-month lockup period. This prevents robust coupling of the underlying asset and the market price of the securities on the secondary market. 

More on the difference between GBTC and ETFs can be found in my post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/33rhg9/reality_check_on_the_gbtc_fund/

**So why an ETN, or GBTC, and not an ETF?**

ETFs presently require explicit authorization from the SEC to trade in the United States. GBTC has a 12-month lockup period and likely restrictions on potential investors. 

ETNs and similar derivatives are a way to create new financial products quickly and bring them to market. That comes with expense, risk, and inconvenience relative to instruments like a traditional ETF, which would be more theoretically sound for gaining access to new asset classes like this.  

**How does the ETN issuing financial institution make money?**

Fees! Often another complex formula, often a percent or two per year. So they have an interest in establishing a robust market. 

**Does this mean access for institutional investors?**

Yes and no. It absolutely *increases* access, but it's important to realize institutional investors have a broad spectrum of rules regarding their investments. Some pension funds will only invest in highly rated debt or blue-chip stocks, for example, and a bitcoin ETN would hardly be an option for them. On the other end of the spectrum, the entire purpose of hedge funds is often to invest in assets that are otherwise challenging to obtain for technical or regulatory reasons. Private funds can and do invest in assets of all kinds - loan pools, international real estate, commodities, commodity futures, exotic derivatives, credit, etc.  They exist and operate without the need for exchange traded products. To put it bluntly: ""Wall Street"" and ""Institutional Investors"" are *not* presently locked out of bitcoin investment. Many *can and do* buy bitcoin directly, and many alternative investment vehicles - like direct investment in GBTC rather than OTC trading of its shares - already exist. Products like ETNs broaden the investment pool, but they don't open it for the first time. /u/tothemoonguy can be on standby, but don't look at May 18th as an unambiguous bat signal either. 

**I like derivatives. Will there be futures and options *based on the ETN* too?**

Who knows! But derivatives mean new products to trade and new products and new trading generate new fees, so if we're lucky... it may well be derivatives all the way down.

personalfinance,"Debt Consolidation Loan, BK7, or Credit Card Default?","My wife and I have approximately 22,000 in credit card debt between both of us, at 15-20% interest rate. We have a mortgage, a car loan that's about to be paid off in full, and own one car outright. The total monthly minimum payments are around $500 and we pay around $700 a month, but because of the interest charges it'll be a long while before it's paid in full. I live in AZ.

In search through this sub and reddit in general, I found this thread http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1i99wz/is_debt_consolidation_a_good_idea/ about credit card default, which I hadn't heard before as a strategy.

I really don't want to do a bankruptcy, and am not sure how a debt consolidation loan works. I know the principles of paying off credit card debt using the snowball method, but frankly we don't have the money in our budget to get that done.

personalfinance,Inheriting a whole life insurance policy?,"Hey /r/personalfinance, 
I wanted to start looking at where I can put money that would be a safe place for the second half (months 4-6) of my emergency fund.

My father when I was 2 years old bought a whole life insurance policy, claims to have paid 4 years of premiums (about $800 total) at which point he said it became self sustaining and now wants to give it to me 22 years later.  I fully intend on keeping the policy as no matter what, right now, its free life insurance.


Now I don't know much about life insurance and I know people say correctly say ""Don't buy whole life insurance"".   But to my naive eye it looks like my dad did a pretty good job and hes pretty proud of it.

Here's the last 3 years:

The total cash value grew over 9% annually in the last 3 years and I've been told its been that way for a very very long time.  The thing that scares me is that there is loan has been growing within the account at about 8% interest basically killing my net growth down to 1%.


Would it be a good use of my money to pay off that loan, freeing up the total cash value to allow it to grow at the 9% rate.. tax free?  Or should I just let the policy ride and find other means to invest the extra money safely.


**TLDR:** Dad bought me whole life insurance 22 years ago, its earning 9% per year with a loan that is rising at interest rate of 8% per year.  Do I pay off that loan to free up the cash value as a secondary emergency fund?

------  
  
By MICHAEL J. CASEY April 29, 2015 11:04 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one of two lead investors in a $50 million funding round for bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd.  
  
Goldman adds its name to a growing list of Wall Street institutions exploring digital-currency technology’s potential to provide faster and cheaper financial transactions and payments.  
  
Circle, based in Boston, uses bitcoin-based systems to allow customers to digitally store money and transfer it to and from other people and merchants.  
  
The new $50 million injection comes on top of $26 million in prior financing founds for Circle and, according to people familiar with the deal, values the startup at around $200 million.  
  
Goldman declined to comment about its investment beyond a brief statement in the news release from Tom Jessop, managing director of the investment bank’s Principal Strategic Investments Group. He said the investment bank sees “significant opportunities in companies and solutions that have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation.”  
    
Circle said in a statement that the investment bank’s co-lead investor was China-based IDG Capital Partners, an early investor in Chinese Internet giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. The firm’s involvement reflects a new push from Circle to break into the Chinese market.  
  
The funding news coincides with Circle’s move to allow consumers to hold traditional currencies in their accounts in addition to bitcoin. Chief Executive Jeremy Allaire said Circle will start with dollar offerings but then provide Chinese yuan accounts and other currencies once it can do so practically and compliantly.  
  
Also joining the investment round were Circle’s existing investors, including Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Accel Partners and Digital Currency Group. The firms’ individual contributions weren’t disclosed.  
  
Goldman’s commitment to Circle follows investments by the New York Stock Exchange, Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and USAA Bank in San Francisco startup Coinbase, which runs a bitcoin exchange and competes with Circle in the market for bitcoin wallets, with which users store and send digital currency.  
  
Also, UBS AG this month said it would establish a special research lab to explore financial uses for the core technology underlying bitcoin—its so-called “blockchain” digital ledger.  
  
The strategy to offer dollar-based services marks an important shift for Circle, which began as a purely bitcoin wallet service. Mr. Allaire says the inclusion of fiat currencies is consistent with the firm’s founding philosophy.  
  
“We’ve always preached this idea of the hybrid digital economy where fiat currencies can move frictionlessly around the world using bitcoin as the free Internet payment network,” Mr. Allaire said in an interview.  
  
Dollar account holders’ funds will reside with Circle’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured banking partner, Silicon Valley Bank of Santa Clara, Calif. It is expected that similar setups will be established with regulated banking entities as Circle establishes access to yuan, euros, yen or other currencies.  
  
Unlike other fast, low-cost, dollar-based digital money-transfer platforms such as PayPal or the digital money-sharing app Venmo, which operate exclusively inside their own “closed-loop” networks, Circle’s inclusion of a bitcoin connection allows users to send money outside the firm’s network. It achieves what Mr. Allaire describes as the goal of interoperability.  
  
Circle is trying a similar strategy in the Chinese market, where hundreds of millions of mobile-phone-toting consumers frequently use closed-loop services such as Alibaba’s Alipay service and the payment app attached to Tencent’s messaging service WeChat. Mr. Allaire called China “an extremely attractive market in terms of consumer behavior and in terms of scale,” highlighting the Chinese government’s desire to develop an economy that is led by consumers that spend their money globally.  
  
It is a similar bet to one being played by Beijing-based bitcoin exchange OKCoin, which is launching a “Superwallet” for storing yuan and other currencies, giving users the capacity to use those funds to purchase goods offered for sale in other countries in bitcoins.  
  
“The opportunities for cross-border payment activity and for digital money are exploding as we speak,” says Jim Breyer, a partner at Breyer Capital and Accel Partners—both early investors in Circle, who in the past has collaborated in Chinese investments with IDG.

###Peganalysis

So what else do you need to see?  Blythe Masters is working in bitcoin space, the first bitcoin exchange fund will begin trading soon, and now Goldman Sachs can't even afford to ignore bitcoin any longer.  
  
Berkshire Hathaway, 2.92% owner of Goldman Sachs, just caused Mr. Buffet to make his first investment in the emerging tech universe of cryptocurrency.  Why?  *Because it's a smart move!*  
  
It might hurt to admit that I'm right on this one, but I am.  2016 is going to see bitcoin prices way, **way** higher than piddly $220 each.  
  
The financial universe can only send you so many wakeup calls.  It would be foolish not to have at least 1% of your portfolio in bitcoin or bitcoin-related tech at this point.",finance,1430378592

~~I'm not paying off my federal loan at the moment b/c I am 'making' $0 in the U.S. I am not required to pay off this loan for another 300 months. However, I do realise interest is mounting and will eventually address this problem.

~~I'm currently paying my $164.00 a month student loan. However, I'm paying $200 a month in an attempt to reduce my interest accruing against me.

After all my bills are paid, I usually have around 800-1,000 euros. however, as a freelancer, the money I take home is inconsistent...sometimes more, sometimes less.

Anyways, I feel I can safely save around 300-500 euros a month. Currently, I am putting that money into a savings account w/ Ally bank @ .99% interest - I'm not making anything. 

I'd like to open a Vanguard account and put my first $3,000 into a Roth IRA and then hopefully another Vanguard account with more risk/higher reward (what are some good options?). Afterwards, I'd like to make an additional investment into overseas property, which seems more like a dream than a reality.

I know that I am YEARS away from financial independence, however, I'm curious as to if I'm on the right track. 

What would you do? Suggestions? Criticism? I'm open to hearing all about your advice, as I don't know a lot about financial independence.",finance,1430389309

personalfinance,Budgeting for loan payoff or house downpayment,"I've read the ""I have $X, what should I do with it?"" down to Step 6 -- Save for other goals, and that's where I'm stuck. I'm trying to decide between a few goals and just running around in circles.

Long story short: I recently finished paying off my private student loans and got a (minor) pay raise at about the same time. This frees up a bit of money in my budget and I have two thoughts about how to reallocate it. I currently have the emergency fund, saving for retirement, making all my bills, investing a good chunk in a three-fund portfolio, etc., so I'm not starting from scratch, but I'm looking for opinions on two places to put the money.

Currently, I have a car loan (~$9k, 2.8%) and federal student loans (~$10k, 3.3%) that I've making ""rounded up"" minimum payments on. Monthly payments on each is something odd, like $164.58 (for example), so I'm just dropping $200/month to keep the math simple and pay them off slightly faster. I have enough in savings to simply pay off the loans, but at 3% interest each, I'm investing the money instead of just paying off the debts.

Next big Life Step is buying a house at some point in the not too distant future. I'm currently renting and looking for a modest ""starter"" home and home prices nearby are relatively low.  Currently, I have enough saved (and earmarked) to put down a good 10% (~$20k) without affecting other savings, investments, retirement, etc.

So, here's the dilemma. With the freed up funds, should I funnel it into paying off the relatively low interest loans, try to double up the house downpayment to avoid PMI, or just earmark it for ""House Expenses"" and keep it relatively liquid? I feel like no option is going to give me a huge ROI in a ~2 year timeframe -- or rather, they're all about the same. If I pay off the loans, I can be Debt-Free^TM for a little while before getting a mortgage, which is psychologically nice, but financially unneeded. I feel like keeping it liquid (well, semi-solid) is best, but then I feel like I'm not doing enough with my money. Is there another factor that I'm missing here?",finance,1430402563
personalfinance,Saving money in the long run by buying a house with &lt; 20% down?,"I'm looking for some advice here. My wife and I are currently deciding if we want to buy a house now, or wait and save for a 20% down payment. We are looking at houses in the $150k range and can put ~20k down right now. Current interest rates for a 30 yr fixed mortgage are ~3.9% and seem to be expected to go to ~5% by this time next year. These are the results of my math:



 | This Year | Next Year
---|---|----
Loan Amount | $150k | $150k
Down Payment % | 13% | 20%
Interest Rate | 3.9% | 5%
PMI rate | $70 | $0
Months to 20% Equity | 50 | 0
Cost of PMI | $3500 | $0
Interest Payed on Loan | $71,600 | $81,900
Interest &amp; PMI | **$75,100** | **$81,900**



So according to my math, if I wait for a year to save for a 20% down payment I end up paying ~$6k more interest over the life of the loan, even after accounting for the cost of the PMI. Does this look right? Am I not accounting for something here?",finance,1430403379

investing,Yahoo Finance: Bad sign? Retail investors all in: TD Ameritrade,"**This text is originally posted @ Yahoo Finance. Useful information for retail investors.**

A broad look at the 6.5 million customer accounts at TD Ameritrade (NYSE: AMTD) indicates that retail investors are ""pretty fully invested"" in stocks, the online brokerage's CEO said Thursday.

Fred Tomczyk cited several signs of this: margin loans at high levels, client cash at low levels and account holders at the firm logging in frequently. ""It's usually a good indication that people are very engaged in the markets and watching their investments closely,"" he said on CNBC's "" Squawk Box .""

But Tomczyk acknowledged the potential pitfalls of these trends and what they may portend for stocks. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we have a correction here. We've had six [or] 6½ years of up markets here.""

The Dow Jones industrial average (Dow Jones Global Indexes: .DJI) and the S&amp;P 500 (INDEX: .SPX) were relatively flat on the year as of Wednesday's closing. ""I think last year it wasn't an overly strong market. This year it hasn't been an overly strong market,"" Tomczyk said. ""I think it's all going to depend on what the data tells us about the U.S. economy in the next three to six months.""

Many economists are expecting a pickup in growth in the second half of the year, after the government on Wednesday reported that first-quarter gross domestic product grew at a lower-than-expected 0.2 percent. The economy advanced 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter and 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014.

In a policy statement Wednesday, the Fed played down the soft economic growth and removed all calendar references to when an interest rate hike may be coming.

Liftoff in June seems to be pretty much out, with September seen as the most likely month for the first rate increase in nearly a decade. But Tomczyk believes the Fed won't move until later. ""What the forward [yield] curve would tell you right now [is] short term rates aren't going to move until December.""

Earlier on ""Squawk Box,"" UBS economist Drew Matus argued for a June move. ""They had June lined up in their sights as of March.""

""I think everything would be functioning a lot better now,"" if the Fed didn't back off, he said.


Looking at individual stock names, Tomczyk said, ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is our most widely held stock. [It] has been for a long time.""

He also said clients are heavily invested Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), which has fallen about 5 percent in 2015 along with the 40 percent decline in oil prices over the past 12 months, though U.S. crude has been recovering somewhat.

""We have [a] large active trader base and so they tend to have a contrarian view,"" said Tomczyk, whose company is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year.

Last week, TD Ameritrade (NYSE: AMTD) reported earnings of 35 cents per share for its fiscal second quarter, which were were in line with expectations. Revenue of $803 million was below forecasts for $821 million.

Earlier this month, rival Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW) missed on the top and bottom lines, with earnings of 22 cents per share on revenue of $1.53 billion in the first quarter.",finance,1430407639

We closed on a short sale about 12 months ago, and are just waiting for the time when a lender will work with us again.  In the meantime, some housekeeping on our credit is in order.


**Auto Loan**

Looking to purchase a used sedan at $8K - $9k.  We are exploring two options to pay for this auto.  


The first is a personal/family loan at zero interest, to be paid in monthly installments of about $2,200. 


The second option is to finance through a credit union under normal terms, but to pay it off in a similar time frame as the personal loan.  Assuming there are no pre-payament penalties, the only cost to financing is obviously paying the interest.  However, I'd like to know if it would be more beneficial to us to finance, and build up that credit worthiness, vs saving a few dollars by going the personal loan route.  


**Student Loan**

Looking to take out personal loan through another lender to pay off federal student loans, and move into a single lower rate.  


The current lender refuses to consolidate the 4 seperate loans we have, and the rates on each loan are killing us.


Does this make financial sense?  Recomendations?  Concerns?  Would making a move like look better to our credit history's then if didn't do anything and just contunues to pay down the current loan.



So really, this post is about better understanding what would look best in the eyes of a lender, from a credit history point of view, based on the two above scenarios.

Sorry the formatting is kinda crap...

The mortgage payment includes prin, int, PMI, insurance, taxes.
We use our Chase card for monthly expenses and pay it off each month (or try to). Amazon, Discover, and US Bank are all on 0% promos that need to be paid off by the payoff date so we don't get hit with interest.
We are only paying on one of our student loans right now. This is on a graduated plan.
The payoff dates are if there were no accelerated payments.	


Edit: The Due date/frequency is not $530 a week but $530 a month but shopping is done weekly, etc. The bolded items are what we can use our Chase card for each month that mostly gets paid off in full each month. Also, this looks so much better on Excel...

financialindependence,For those of us outside the US,"Hello everyone. 

I posted this yesterday in another forum but didn't get many responses:

I really need some advice regarding saving for retirement/future. I'm a 32 years old guy living in Guatemala, and, being this a third world country, many things about retirement I've read from books don't apply here.
Everywhere I read and every book talks about IRA and all kinds of sweet retirement plans they offer in the US but where I live they don't have it. So, what to do instead?
In Guatemala, the government takes 5% from your monthly income which goes to social security. This crappy plan is mandatory, and it gives you, when you retire, a very low salary.
The only option is opening a retirement bank account, but the banks here offer like 6.5% interest rate.
What do you suggest? My wife and I already save 20% of our monthly income, we don't have debt, we have a paid home and we're starting to save for an emergency fund (at least 6 months) and our upcoming baby spendings. But, what to do about the retirement/financial independence thing?

So my big question is, are there any other competitive fixed rate refinancing options out there for me? My credit score is around 740, although SoFi said they pulled my credit score from ""this consumer reporting agency"" and it was 781 (pretty nuts, don't believe that).


Another thing worth mentioning is I have lots of small federal loans with rates between 3.4% and 6.8%. I have only 1 loan under 4.5% and it's 4.4K @ 3.4%. So I have around 42K in federal loans between 4.5% and 6.8% mostly unsubsidized fixed but a few subsidized fixed. The big draw with SoFi is their tiny fixed interest rate as low as 3.5%. Is it realistic to think I can get 10-40K refinanced around that rate and should I even refinance in my current situation? I thought having great credit and a steady income would help but with the 65k in student/auto debt, I'm not sure.


Also [this](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/5-banks-to-refinance-your-student-loans/) seems to be the article that is thrown around the most on this matter. Is there anything else out there other than this? I don't know that I would get accepted for any of these guys.

It was recommended that I make a table of my loans and interest rates. My wife and I are in this together so here is what we are tackling:

We are also paying off a parent plus loan. It's not in our name but My wife made an agreement to pay it. I don't have the exact information for it in front of me but I think it looks something like this. The monthly payment is for sure $200 and I know the interest rate is over 7% but it could be more or less.

Parent Plus | Federal | **$10,000** | 8.0% fixed | **$200** | Wife

personalfinance,How do you figure out what a reasonable amount to spend on a car is?,"It's soon going to be time to replace one of our cars. I know everyone says only pay cash, but when I can get an interest rate of .9-1.5% from my credit union, I'm going to do it. I'm a firm believer in using dirt cheap debt while it's still an option.


What I'm trying to figure out is, how do people determine what a reasonable amount of money is to spend on a car? I.e. with homes, there's the 2.5x times your annual income criteria. Is there something similar with cars? 


I'll just use some approximate numbers here, maybe someone can give me an idea of what they feel is appropriate. I've been looking at cars in the 20-25k range. People keep telling me we could ""afford"" a 40k car, but I don't want to be home poor, and I'm planning on buying a 2-4 year old car. Just trying to figure out some general guidelines for how much car we can afford


EDIT: I'm curious. Fundamentally, if the interest is dirt cheap, you plan on keeping the car for 8-10 years, and you have adequate gap insurance, what's the issue with stretching a loan out 4-5 years as opposed to 2-3 years? Assuming that the interest is the same for both terms, what's the advantage to artificially deflating your financial flexibility by having a higher payment?",finance,1430425011
personalfinance,"Student loans with FedLoan, questions about paying them off early","I know when making extra payments I should earmark them as going toward the principal only, but since they don't give that option on the web site to do that, do I need to talk to someone there every time I make an extra payment? Or do I just have to write 'principal only' on the check and send it in?",finance,1430425316
investing,ELI5: Why aren't individual bonds clearly a better choice than bond funds in a historically low interest rate environment,"I see people posting fears that bonds funds are going to tank when interest rates presumably rise from record lows and only individual bonds make sense to own at a time like this. The usual response is to not worry as bond funds will do as well as individual bonds over the long term because.... *something something duration re-investment market timing etc*. It still seems counterintuitive how a fund could do as well as individual bonds which have a guaranteed payout and I have trouble understanding the rationales usually given. The duration and re-investment arguments seem like they could equally apply to individual bond laddering and as long as you are not messing with your overall allocations I don't see why simply changing method of ownership should be grouped with the usual market timing behaviors we warn about like getting out of the market and making reactionary re-allocation decisions, it is simply changing *how* you own your allocation similar to putting cash in money markets vs CDs.",finance,1430425546

personalfinance,Consolidating Student Loans (Navient),"Hey PF!

I have 7 student loans (Stafford, Sub, and Unsub) all through Navient with varying interest rates from 5% to 6.88%. I am currently on track to have them paid off in 7 years so I do not want to start a new plan of say 10 years unless it is beneficial. I am trying to get my finances in order to better plan for the future. My current option I am looking at is to consolidate all the loans to help improve the interest rate but I am not really sure where to start.

Would it be beneficial to consolidate the loans or is there another route that would be better?

At what interest rate does increasing the term become more beneficial than what is left of my term?

Hopefully this is enough information. Any advice would be greatly beneficial!

Edit: My other option I am leaning towards is paying more towards the highest interest loan of first to help reduce the long term rate.",finance,1430431809
personalfinance,Attempting to settle defaulted student loans. Need advice.,"In 2008, I defaulted on my student loans and out of fear and immaturity, I never got them out. My federal loans are $22,804 (including $5,335 in interest). 
I no longer live in the US and haven't for quite some time due to marriage. I was recently granted permanent residency and can finally work, however, I just found out I'm pregnant so it's making the already difficult job hunt a bit trickier. 
A family member has offered to help so I'm trying to figure out if it would be possible to negotiate the outstanding balance based on my situation (living abroad, unemployed, pregnant), and if anyone on reddit has had experience settling their federal student loans for less. 

Also, would love advice on how to approach the collections agencies when I ask them about this. 

Thanks!",finance,1430432834

Any extra cash I always throw on it, $700 has been the least I can pay, this month I did 1200 for example. I spoke to my financial counselor at my bank (Navy Federal) and she said the BoFA card I found that has 0% APR for 21 months would be wise to transfer over two of the 3 cards I have. After the 21 months my APR will be 14.99, the transfer fee is 3%. Has anyone found any current offers out there that are better than this? There are no other real perks for this card besides the automatic car rental insurance (which I would actually use quite often). After I pay this card off I intended to cancel the card, is this a bad idea?
