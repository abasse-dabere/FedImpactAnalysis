I just received the system back today and it's got a [pretty](http://imgur.com/XWAY4Qg) [significant](http://imgur.com/6EJUMjr) [crack](http://imgur.com/QYShYUo) in the outer case now. I spoke with a supervisor at Sony and they claim cosmetic damage isn't covered by their warranty, even when their repair center is the cause. The shipping box doesn't appear to have any damage so I'm not going to pursue escalating with FedEx. The @askplaystaition twitter account hasn't replied and the supervisor gave me a mailing address to a PO BOX to further escalate my claim, but mentioned they would give me the same response.

She has a credit score of 720 last time we checked. She has practically no debt since she is about to pay off her credit card. 


Problem is I owe a lot on my car and I'm getting destroyed in interest rates. 

Owe $16112 @ 13.69% interest

I've looked at using solar, but I'll be honest, I really don't understand how much I pay per kwh on my utility.

This shows my bill as $357, but my actual bill this month was $108.  I don't know what the second chunk (delivery charges) actually is.  

I think this is for a meter reading from Janurary to April and then they sliced it into thirds maybe?  I'm not entirely sure.

[Here is my average per-day usage for the last year.  I definitely need to reduce the usage.](http://i.imgur.com/xNP28EK.png) and why I want to look at solar and possibly small vertical wind generators.


It also looks like I pay around 6.9cents per kwh offpeak and 8.25cents on peak.  Am I wrong?  


I ask because when I put all of this into the calculator at [pvwatts](http://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php), it doesn't seem like a good idea financially to move to solar.

personalfinance,Coming back from basically no credit to qualifying for a mortgage in 2-4 years. Am I doing this right?,"39F, employed full time, widowed with 3 kids.

Currently the kids and I are living in a rental house that I love. It's perfect for us. We've been here a little over a year and want to stay long term. The landlords are an older couple. Looking down the road they want to sell the house but there isn't a defined time line. 2-4 years is a reasonable estimate.

I knew my credit wasn't great so I pulled my credit reports (all 3 bureaus) and my FICO score. My score is only 589. That seems to be due to the fact that I have basically no credit. I have a car loan which I got last month. The only other thing on the reports (other than inquiries when I bought the car) is a credit card from 2010 that is paid and closed. That is counting against me.

I spoke with my credit union about what I need to do to qualify for a mortgage in 2 years (other than a down payment, obviously). They laid out a plan for me. 

I applied for and was approved for a secured credit card. It's a $250 limit. I have two small bills that total about $40/month. I'm thinking I can charge those bills and pay them off monthly. That should help my score and after a year I can apply to get that moved to a traditional credit card.

The representative from the CU suggested at the 12 month mark I refinance the car loan. I have a shitty interest rate on it but waiting 12 months will let a good history build up and give me a better shot at a decent rate.

Any other ideas? I have a second account at another credit union. Should I do a secured credit card from them also? Would that help the score more than just the one? Any other ideas?",finance,1430509467
personalfinance,My parents asked me to do some research for them. This is what I have so far. What do you think? I would really appreciate opinions!,"My parents are nearing retirement (ages 59 and 52) and just started thinking about working out their finances. About 2 years ago their income shot up because they started a business. Here is the general picture as of today:

* no debt (house, cars, CC's paid off) 
* savings: 250,000
* income: around 150,000-200,000 
* IRA: 26,000 (recently started maxing it out)

**They asked me to help them plan for their future. Here is what I have so far (incorporating their preferences), please let me know what you think!**

* keep 100,000 as an emergency fund (they won't be comfortable with anything less in their savings. I can convince them to move it to a higher interest account, maybe something at Barclays or Ally)

* continue maxing out IRA's every year (due to a number of circumstances I won't go into, I have 0 input into how this money is invested *and* it's at Edward Jones. I know this is not ideal, but there is nothing I can do about it)

* there is no 401k available to them and setting one up at their business is not a feasible option (more details I won't go into) 

This leaves them with 150,000 to invest in a non tax advantaged account (250,000 savings - emergency fund). Based on what I've read, given their age, a good breakdown would be 60 stocks/40 bonds

I also read that ETF's are more tax friendly than mutual funds. So I was thinking a good breakdown might be:

* 75,000 in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)

* 15,000 in Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) 

* 60,000 in _______________ (bonds)???

I know bonds aren't very tax friendly (but they won't budge on how the IRA money is invested so I can't stick the bonds in there). What would be a good bond fund for them? I was thinking perhaps federally tax exempt municipal bonds (something like VWITX)? Any input is appreciated!

* last step, keep expenses low and continue investing leftovers in the funds above (realistically, about 100,000+ per year)

I really wanted a warranty after being fed up of shelling out for my old car all the time. I bought a car for £10300, paid £400 deposit on a debit card. They added a 5 year warranty and service package (£1995) as I told them I only wanted to buy a car with warranty. I Financed the balance £12000~ with RateSetter and I drove away happy the same day.

Fast forward 11 days, CarCraft announce they are going into administration. Great, what about my warranty? So I phoned the guy who sold me the car (I got his mobile number just in case), he has been told to look for a new job, but he told me that they were trying to find an external provider to take on the customers that got the extended warranty packages and I should have a letter in the post in a couple of weeks. Now this sounds like rubbish to me, why would another company take on my warranty when CarCraft have already had all the money?

So I have 3 days under my 'Right to Withdraw' to cancel my credit agreement with RateSetter (actually just tomorrow (saturday) as monday is a bank holiday and they are closed). I don't want to wait to see if I get a letter from CarCraft as I highly doubt I will and I'll miss my chance to end the credit agreement.

I will be entering my sophomore year this fall and living in an apartment with a friend and it will be about $570/month. Currently my parents pay for my tuition and books so I do not need to factor that into this situation. I need to secure a loan to pay for my rent/living expenses. I did not think I would need one when the window to reapply for the federal loans was open, so I missed out on those unfortunately. I work a job that will be giving me around $400 a month beginning in June. It is not a part time job and will end with me obtaining my job in my career path upon graduation. I cannot get another job along with this one due to conflicting schedules. I need to figure out the best loan available to secure, in order to be able to pay my living expenses for the next year.

I've owned only one credit card in my life and while it was close to maxed for a while (unavoidable bills when I was first on my own), I was never late and eventually paid it off around 3 years ago. However, since then I have not used it at all and it was closed a couple of years back. I didn't think anything of it because I'd reached a point where I did not feel I needed a credit card, but now I find I can't get a personal loan because of it.

I've run into this problem before when I was younger and needed a car. I ended up getting a Springleaf financial loan which took 3 years to pay back, but I at least had a car. Now, even though my financial stability has improved considerably I unfortunately do not have access to a credit union, so I still find myself having to consider Springleaf as an option. I've already got around 1200 in savings so I figured with Springleaf I'd apply for a $3300 loan with a 24 month payback period. That's 137.50 before interest and I can easily pay on average at least double that each month. Still, Springleaf interest rates suck and I'd like to hear if anyone had any suggestions for alternatives which may offer lower rates. 

One idea I had was to get the loan through Springleaf and then transfer the debt to my wife's Chase credit cards, which both have about 2k student debt on each and a $4500 limit. I think the interest rate on those are less than 10%.

It came to my knowledge recently that at some point in 2009 (likely the worst time during his entire life that he could have done this) my father cashed in his declining 401k and has had a substantial of M1 sitting savings/checking since then. Yes--Not even money market. Although I am not experienced in finance myself, I keep a close eye on markets and have studied it in school as part of one of my majors (Economics). I'm confident that I can *at least* get that sum to keep up with inflation, which will be increasingly more important if/when we see a federal funds rate target move later this year.

What I would like to do is act as a thoughtful proxy to help manage this money by setting up various accounts for him. No, he will not do this himself. I am open to recommendations on this, but at the moment I'm thinking about splitting it up a few ways: The bulk would be in non-specific Vanguard and/or Schawb, and some domestic T-bills/CDs for long-term once they start looking up (bad RoI, but safety is nice); much less would be in specific stock picks which I'll spare you from; then I would take a small chuck out to play with FX (stupid, yes).

The real question I have for you PFers is how to be go about facilitating the transfer of funds between me and him, and is there a common method for doing this? I am not looking to create my own business just to do this, so I'm trying to think of a method that will be both casual and legal. It seems like if the money was transferred into an account of mine and I just managed it as my own, I would have to declare it as income upon entry, I would then have to declare any returns, and then he would have to declare the income again upon return. This would be ridiculous. Another way to do it would be for him to simply give me full access to his accounts, but I'd rather not invade his personal information that way.

My situation is that I am going gangbusters to try to get my mortgage paid off sooner, rather than later. Everything extra is going to the mortgage (tax return, extra paychecks, overtime, etc.) 

However, I ran the numbers and realized that *investing* the money might get it paid off sooner than just paying the mortgage directly. Like a year sooner, if I was able to get a 7% ROI, vs 3.5% interest rate on the mortgage.

Not only that, it would keep my money liquid-ish rather than socked into the house.

I refinanced some of my student loans to get lower interest rates. As a result, I have interest rates which vary over 2%, with my highest rate still being 6.55%. I would like to consolidate these loans instead of having so many separate payments, but I also do not want to increase the interest I am paying on any individual loan.

University of California employee, 32 yo single. My gross salary is $3512/month. I have a large windfall (cash) and am trying to come up with a creative way to shift most of it into retirement accounts (planning to do mega backdoor rollovers into Roth IRA). I believe that I can adjust retirement contributions to make this happen. Here is my plan:


| Amount     | Description                       | Fed Tax Exempt   | Ca Tax Exempt   |
|-----------:|-----------------------------------|-----------------:|----------------:|
| +3512.00   | Salary                            |                  |                 |

| -245.84    | UC pension plan                   | 245.84           | 245.84          |

| -1500.00   | After-tax 401(a) DCP contribution | 0.00             | 0.00            |

Both HSA and health insurance reduce FICA tax. 

Now, since I haven't actually enacted these retirement plan deductions, I am NOT sure of the amounts of tax withholdings. After some math using [this calculator](http://www.suburbancomputer.com/tips_calculator.php), I came up with:

| Amount     | Description                       | Fed Tax Exempt   | Ca Tax Exempt   | 
|-----------:|-----------------------------------|-----------------:|----------------:|
|  -185.67   | Federal tax withheld ??           |                  |                 |
|   -33.78   | California tax withheld ??        |                  |                 |

If all calculations are correct, I should still be in the 15% tax bracket and be left with:

| Amount     | Description                       | Fed AGI*/month    | Ca AGI*/month    | 
|-----------:|-----------------------------------|-----------------:|----------------:|

*based on salary only

I spent the first 2 years of my military career buying what ever I felt like regardleaa of debt gained. Instead od continuing down this path I want to turn it all around. 

My debt is as follows, 10k to student loans, 1k amazon at  25.99 variable, 3.3k credit card 1 at 15.9 variable, and 4.6k credit card 2 15.15 variable.

I also have a rewards card at amazon  that is completely paid off as of today. I currently have, 4 open credit accounts and that seems plain silly to me what should I keep and what should I get rid of is my first question.

my plan for going debt free is to pay off amazon first due to higher interest rate then work on credit card 1 and then credit card 2 which leqds me to finally wittling away student loan. is this a good way to go about it or is there a smarter path I am missing.

personalfinance,Transunion deleted my wifes collection account that was legitimate after I disputed it online with her!,"Newlywed M, 26.  about 9 months married now.

Sat my wife down about four months ago and we wrote down and looked up online all our debts, interest rates and bills.

She told me she had one school loan, and 3 credit cards currently.  I asked about any other things she can think of but may have forgotten.  She says she had medical bills but doesn't know what happened to them.  UGHHGH!

&amp;nbsp;

I pull her annualcreditreport.com file and save all 3.  Ended up having her medical debt showing in her collection account from some LLC.

I call the LLC and ask to pay for delete, and gave em the ""This is my wifes credit, and my money, she has nothing in her name, you won't get shit suing her, this is your only chance!"" speech.  That didn't work.

I ask them to send me a settlement offer in the mail.  When I get the letter, I pay it, and a few weeks go by and I see the settlement paid letter from them.

&amp;nbsp;

I wait some more and I'm still checking her credit, because for some reason her sisters credit was also mixed up with my wifes credit.  So I was disputing that, but the problem was only on Transunion.  I tried calling and disputed it on the phone with them, which they told me they did, but they never responded.

I ended up disputing online Transunion website.  Within one week they send me a confirmation # and it's not from the phone call, but from the website comfirmation # that they had cleared up the mess up of her sister and her credit mixing up.  I check it and sure enough it is fixed.

&amp;nbsp;

I got an idea to dispute her collection account.  I know for a fact a lot of collection agencies get lazy after a debt is already finished and paid from a friend who worked at one.  So I disputed it with transion in a separate dispute and clicked the option to ""check/verify the information"" or something like that.

Another week passes by and what do you know?  Confirmation and removed both her medical collection debt from that same company.

&amp;nbsp;

Next i'm going to try to get them on Equifax and Experian.  I feel like Experian doesn't really matter as much as Equifax and Transunion as well.

I made 29k a year 3 years ago, I now make 35k a year. had 36k in student debt 2 years ago. i had 36k in debt 3 years ago and 37k in debt 4 years ago. needless to say... i was wasting money, and getting nowhere on my loans. I decided to make a change and started researching. 

I conceived a 5 year plan. I am on year 3 of:

---------------------Completed part

Year Zero: just things I did to get ready for this plan. Got a Credit Card (cash back rewards Amex blue), I started a bank account with Ally and moved my money into that account. I kept a credit union open for a local storefront, but I use it less and less often. I started my 401k contribution put in up to my maximum match.

year 1:  Created a budget tracking spreadsheet. I keep track of all expenses to the penny. Saving an emergency fund was done here. I watched the number on my account grow and thought of it like a game. I saved enough for my wife and I to have a nice cushion (just in case) at the time we kept separate finances (we weren't married at the time)

Year 2, Pay off car. I completed this in 8 months by using the money i would have been putting into savings. my wife and I got married. we did so on a budget. our entire wedding cost $5,000.00 we made 3,000.00 in gifts which we put into the bank. my wife covered our honey moon to Disney. 

Year 3. we put our finances together. Had to buy a Car. Emergency fund came in handy. I have recovered most of that expense. Over the remainder of my second year on this plan and up until now, I paid down 7.5k loan and finished paying it this week! I made decent progress on the rest of my loans. the total of my Naviant Loans is just under 9k. My discover Loan is just under 5K. I will now be splitting Naviant into different pay groups and I will begin paying down my Naviant Loans.

---------------------to be done

Year 4: I should finish paying off Naviant by the end of year 4. If my calculations are correct, Discover will be nearly paid off my minimum payments by then. 

year 5: Pay off remainder of Discover loan. Start an IRA Contribution/HSA. Pay off car loan. save to take my wife on vacation.",finance,1430571170
personalfinance,Student Loan Interest Rates - are you seeing higher rates than stated?,"I was reviewing my AES student loan statement today and am curious what others are experiencing, because something does not make sense to me.  After completing undergraduate and graduate studies, I am finally down to a $16K balance at 7.25%.  This is a legacy loan that I consolidated back in the 90's when only one consolidation to a low rate was permitted, but that is not my observation.

I have been paying anywhere from $300 to $600 per month.  Last month I remitted $600.  Per the statement, that took off $489.04 of principal and $110.96 in interest.  If my principal at April 1, 2015 was 16,107.88 at a 7.25% rate, simply calculated (back of the envelope) that would suggest an annualized interest amount of $1,167.82 (16,107.88 x .0725) or a monthly at $97.32 (1,167.82 / 12). In order to derive a $110.96 in interest off of 16,107.88 in a single month, the implied interest rate would need to be around 8.26%.

Is anyone else seeing anomalies like this?  I would hate to think that I have been overpaying interest for all of these years...",finance,1430576086

I've been shopping around at the various places offering student loan consolidation, and it looks like the best fixed rate I can get is 4.8%. 

I think it makes sense to do this for the federal loans, but I'm not sure if I should for the private ones. My fear is that if rates start going up, I won't be able to get this rate anymore and it will be too late. But on the other hand, it's a higher rate and seems rather foolish.

I have a credit card with an $8,000 limit for emergencies, along with $2,000 in actual cash for emergencies.  The emergency money is just in a basic savings account with my bank.

personalfinance,Marijuana farmers need advice on Land Contract with nice old lady.,"This is a bit of a strange question. 

My husband and I are legal marijuana farmers in a medical state. We are 100% in compliance with all local regulations and statues.

This year we are permitted to grow 72 plants. Our problem is, due to moving this year, we don't have our own land. The mother of a friend and former business partner approached us about growing on her land, for a lump sum paid to her at the end of harvest. This sum totals 45k.

To me, this number is incredibly high, but growing on some else's property does pose a small risk to them. Basically, the federal government could hypothetically come onto their property and remove the plants, causing damage to their land. Because of the collective shift happening in DC in regards to medical states, this is highly unlikely. Still, it's possible. Also, we did have to make changes to the land, such as taking down a couple of (pretty dead) trees and putting up a fence. 

We are not very business-savvy people, but I have tried to explain multiple times to my husband that farming comes with a large risk and a large margin of error needs to be accounted for. For example, a tornado could take out half our plants. Mildew could destroy the quality. Thieves could steal the plants when they are close to harvest. A lot of things could happen. 

I've proposed to my husband that he write up a contract which states this woman (a very sweet old lady whom we're glad to help) gets a PERCENTAGE of our profits, with a cap at 45k. I think it's ridiculous to agree on a lump sum so huge when there are so many variables at work here. If we make 100k this year and we are on the hook for 45k, we're screwed. 

My questions are thus: How can I convince my husband we need to cover our asses in the case of catastrophe? How do I need to word this contract so that it is fair to everyone? Should I list more stipulations or is the percentage thing enough to cover us?

Thanks in advance for any and all advice. 

EDIT: Because everyone thinks I'm out to fuck over grandma, I just want to add this small tidbit: Grandma has grown weed on her property for the last five years. She isn't growing this year due to health issues. Her insurance is shit and not covering anything, so SHE approached US about it when she heard we were looking for a place to grow. In return she gets money to cover her health issues. We're not duping some old lady into it. She is well aware of the risks it poses, and she herself is not a legal grower, making our grow SIGNIFICANTLY SAFER than what she's been doing on her land the past five years.

personalfinance,Ivy league or local college?,"**TLDR: I need help deciding whether to go to Columbia University, or a local college**

Ok /r/personalfinance , it's story time. After I graduated high school several years ago, I decided to enter the work force. I knew that if I had gone to college straight from high school I wouldn't have taken it seriously and it would have been a waste of both my time and my parents money. This was validated as I watched a lot of former high school peers spend 7-9 years getting their bachelors, or not even finishing school at all.

Several years ago I found myself in Nepal and for the first time, face to face with abject poverty. There was no sanitation, very little infrastructure, and a dearth of stray animals and trash. I stayed in Nepal for several weeks, slowly trying to come to grips with the poverty of this country. I had experienced my own share of poverty: living on a diet of ramen noodles and water, going to work with holes in my shoes, and counting out change to buy bread. But I've never had to experience the poverty that was rampant in this country. I've always had a warm place to sleep, and a family to help if I needed it.

I returned home and went back to work, but Nepal was always in the back of my mind. There was a question there, one that I couldn't put words to, but present nonetheless. A year passed in which I languished in my job, neither challenging my intellect nor my character. Finally, after speaking to a friend who was graduating from college and commissioning into the military, I realized what I had to do. I went into work and put in my two week notice. Then I started studying for the placement exams for my local community college. I realized that I wanted to work in economic development, and to do that I required a college degree.

After I took the placement exams I had to speak to an academic advisor. I informed her that I was going to earn my associates degree and transfer to a four year college within the year. She laughed at me, told me that it was too ambitious of a goal and that I should just take my time while at school.

That was in July, and this month I will be graduating with an associates degree. This is where I come to my problem and ask for advice. My community college offers a guaranteed admission to several state colleges. I've spoken with the head of the department of the program I wish to proceed in and she seems both knowledgeable as well as incredibly helpful. I have done the math and believe that I can earn a bachelors degree in International Relations with a concentration in economic development within the year. This school also has an accelerated masters program, and I believe that I can earn that masters degree after the following fall semester. Within a year and a half of taking my first class at this new college, I could have both a bachelor's and master's degree.

Several months ago, on a lark, I applied to transfer to Columbia University. Yesterday I received a call explaining that I had been accepted and that the acceptance package was being fedexed to me. Columbia University had been a pipe dream for me. I was a horrible student while in high school, and I never truly believed that I could actually get into an Ivy league school. I applied for the same reason that people purchase lottery tickets. You don't spend that dollar expecting you'll ever win, you are merely buying the hope for a couple of days. You are buying a day dream, a question of ""what would I do with a million dollars"". That is what it started out as, a dream. But then I visited the campus. I noticed that Jeffrey Sachs, one of the most influential developmental economists, teaches there. I saw Butler library. And I instantly wanted to go to Columbia. The cost for school is prohibitive though. I would need to come up with around $60k a year in order to attend classes.

So that is my problem, and the question I pose to /r/personalfinance. Should I attend my local university and earn a bachelor's and master's degree? Or should I attend Columbia university and earn a bachelor's degree there? For the price of one year at Columbia I could finance my entire education at the local university. Is the massive price tag of Columbia University worth the bachelor's degree I could earn there? And should I rack up around $100k in student loans for a dream.

I'm a highschool student who will graduate this year, I have been accepted to a great college for a major in Physics.

- Do you know of any companies who will lend money to me, without a co-signer and no credit history?

- Would the interest rate for a such a loan outweigh it's usefulness?

Looking for advice, opinions, anything really. Detailed breakdown below

I've found a 3BR/2BA apartment I can rent ""from $780"" with two of my buddies. (What exactly does the 'from' entail? That sort of makes me uneasy.) 

I would be paying about $315 a month before utilities (one of us has to take the master bedroom, and I make the most out of the three of us, so I volunteered to take a slightly larger chunk of the rent). I estimated about $100 for utilities for each of us, internet, water, electric. Not sure if that's sufficient.

~$35/month for car insurance, $25 for phone bill. Health insurance and such I can still ride off my parents until I turn 25, so that's a bridge to cross another day.

That's all the expenses I can think of outside of groceries and stuff like clothes. Fuel is not that huge of an expense. I don't really go anywhere that often and work is close by. Will probably be applying for SNAP just as a safety net in case this goes south.

Totals up to about $475 a month for all my standard bills.

How much should I bank up before moving out, just for windfall purposes/buying initial furniture? Once my availability change goes through at work, I should be making about $1k a month, and the goal is to be out of here by the end of the summer.

Is this doable, or am I stuck here? Thanks for any tips.",finance,1430609418
personalfinance,"Low Interest Rates- ""great time to buy a house""... is it??","Everyone I talk to about a potential home purchase always says something like, ""interest rates are so low, now is the time to buy."" 

I agree if someone is in the place to buy a 15, 20, 30 year home its a pretty nice perk to lock in historically low interest rates. My issue is that there is almost no chance I am in the spot to buy a really long term home (starting a family/expensive housing area). 

So is the advice that now is the time to buy because of interest rates, actually sound? I am thinking about buying a small home that I could afford 20% down on but would only live there for 5-7 years. I am very afraid interest rates will creep up over that time and housing prices will either stay the same or even drop. 

I know this could potentially be a real estate question but that sub seems to have mostly real estate agents so they are bias- looking more for the economic/budget/risk analysis of the issue.

personalfinance,"Friend just disclosed severe debt and is looking for advice- I tried, but would like help!","I've been lurking but this is my first post here- thank you for any help! I off-handedly asked my friend, who lives with her parents, about how much she is saving living with them and found the following information instead:

1. She has $100,000 in student loans. Sub and unsub, some personal, some in her parent's name, all of which she is accountable for.

2. She just bought a used car (necessary for her work as an assistant, she has to run errands and things), and has a $9,000 loan on it at 14%.  14. percent.

3. She has two jobs, one only on Tuesdays, $70 a day, and her other one is more contract work for a small business. Sometimes lots of work, other times little. $200/day for 'project days', $15/hour on normal work days.  I'm under the impression she makes about $3000/month. I'm texting her to ask for a solid number but she is very much the early bird to my night owl. I'll update this post when I have a solid number for this.

4. She doesn't have an emergency fund of any sort- has been paying off her car loan as much as she can each month (which, yes, please, that needs to be priority. 14%????)

5. She has no retirement fund/plans. Which yes, she's 23, but I'm also 23.

My recommendations were thus:

-Over the next few months, save up a $1000 emergency fund.

-Basic rules of frugality. Stop eating out/pack lunches, do not buy new clothes, limit driving, stop going to the movies/purchasing books every weekend(We have a fantastic library why are you doing this), live like you are poor because you ARE, etc.

-Take all loans and put them in order by interest percentage. After necessities are paid for each month and minimum loan payments are made, pour all of your money into the highest percentage loan. Once that is paid off, go pay off the next loan, etc.

-I talked to her a bit about roth IRAs, some investment strategies (Keeping it simple, index funds), and touched on the infinite loop combo that is early retirement, but I feel like she needs to focus on her high interest debt first. At what point should she start bypassing paying down her loans to start a roth? (Maybe after the only loans left have interest rates &lt;5%? higher? lower?)

...I'm really confounded by the used car. I feel like she should just sell it back or something, 14%?!? (is this just me being unreasonable? She does need the car for her job...). Apparently she barely had enough money for a minimum down payment, so that's why the rate is so high. BUT IT IS TOO DAMN HIGH. :(

Any advice would be great, I'm actually pretty freaked out by the whole experience- one hears about this kind of debt in young people but one never really meets them. I'm 23, new but enthused about personal finance/investment/early retirement, and really feel over my head with this friend. Thank you!",finance,1430633080

personalfinance,213K student debt (60K fed/140K private/13K CC)--divorced; couldn't finish medical school--seeking repayment strategies. Should I default? What would you do?,"I dropped out of medical school during a rough divorce and now I'm stuck with *200K in student loans--but without the M.D. degree to pay it back. I've racked up another 20K in credit card debt trying to finish a terminal degree, but I'm still a few years away from completing that. * 61K Nelnet (consolidated); 140K private loans (4 loans at 3.1%, 1 at 3.77%); 13K in CC.

I have a decent teaching job (68K annual salary minus 15% local tax (living outside the US)), and I've reduced my credit card debt to 13K, but I would love to take that $1000 per month I’m paying on student loans and pay off my CC faster.

There are reduced payment/deferment options etc... that I could use for a couple of years while reducing my cc debt, but my Ph.D. program is not eligible for an in-school-hold on loan payments, so if I did defer for a while, it would add to the principle (or something). My simple understanding is that if I don't pay at least the monthly interest, it will end up costing me more in the end: but how much more?  That's my question. Would it be more than what I'm paying on my cc?

My second question is hopefully not considered illegal or inappropriate for this forum, but I'm wondering about the ramifications of defaulting on my loans. My federal loans (61K Nelnet) went towards my undergraduate and MS degrees, which I will pay back 100%, that's all mine. There were some shady-dealings by the school (the details of which I'll likely post in a different forum) which I might have had the emotional energy to fight if I wasn't going through a divorce at the time--it's the 140K in private loans which went towards medical school that I'm considering defaulting on. I feel like I got scammed.

Is this when people file for bankruptcy? Refuse to pay their credit cards and private loans/mortgage etc...? I feel responsible for the CC bills because that spending was necessary, so I'll pay those off, but if I could just get rid of the 140K then I could chip away at the reasonable debt I have.

I'm 45. I live most of the year outside the US and though I may eventually move back, I have no immediate plans to get married or buy a house. My kids live with their mom and I visit them regularly. I always pay child support. I don't own any property or vehicles, make enough to pay any US taxes, and there's never more than 4-5K in my bank account at any given point. 

What's the worst that could happen? Are there other options that I should also consider? What would you do? I appreciate any helpful input or ideas.

I have a few questions, but I'll start off with a bit of background in hopes of getting some relevant and helpful feedback.
    
First, I have a BA. Worked and volunteered for 2-3 years after college before landing the job I have now. I earn about $42k a year, but after taxes/health insurance/401k/etc, I get about $1100 biweekly. The job I'm in has promotion potential every year (for up to 2 years), and I'm on track to be making around $51k by November of this year, and $62k by November of 2016 if I stick around.
    
I live in the PNW and pay $1k for a 1BR apartment and around $300 for the rest of my utilities, car insurance, what have you. Leaving me with about $700 a month for food and savings (I have about $4k there now).
    
The certificate program I'm looking at is about $16K for the whole program which can be completed in a 1-2 year time frame, depending on the student. I'm looking to get a student loan, because my employer has a program where they pay off student loans that are greater than $5k. If I qualify for the program, and receive assistance, I have to commit myself to working for this company for a minimum of 3 years. I don't have to stay in the actual position I am in, just stay with the company (which is a nation-wide organization with many opportunities).
    
I don't have any idea about types of loans I should be looking into, what types of interest rates I should be considering, or really anything about student loans in general, because I was fortunate enough to not need any while I was in undergrad.
    
In order to get my loans payed off by my employer I need to be in payback status and not have defaulted at any point. I'd like to find a loan that will pay for my certification (obviously), and then have low enough payments to start off so that most of the loan will be paid off by my employer rather than myself. Like I said before, the loan has to be higher than $5K, and I believe they pay off up to $10K a year(but employees can apply for assistance up to $60K total).
    
If you guys could give me any information about the types of loans I should be looking into, where I can get them, what interest rates I should be shooting for, or any other information, I would greatly appreciate it!

Advice?","Currently finishing my first year of college and as I near the end of my current lease I'm finding most rooms and apartments for rent in the area to be priced absurdly high. I have about $30,000 saved up from my time in service plus the Post 9/11 GI Bill monthly stipend in my area is a little over $2,000 a month but, if any of you are familiar with how that works, it's prorated. In other words, If I'm not in school, I'm not getting paid. Haven't had a need to find work yet but soon I intend to seek something like a bar tending gig on the weekends for some extra cash in my pockets.

With my finances in mind, I have been putting a lot of thought into simply buying a home in the area and filling up the remaining bedrooms with other students (tenants) to cover the costs of the mortgage and other expenditures. As a veteran, I could apply for a VA home loan, (3.375% fixed for a 30YR, 3.125% fixed for a 15YR, according to USAA, https://www.usaa.com/inet/pages/mortgage_VA_loan_landing?akredirect=true) where I wouldn't have to put any money down. Also, according to USAA loan calculators, purchasing a house with a value between $150k-$200k would cost me a mortgage of $675-$900, respectively (at 30YR with the above rate). Even if I were to buy a home for say $150k and I live in it by myself, the mortgage alone at $675 is almost less than half my current lease's monthly rent of $1,263. Also I should note that my current rent of $1,263 is on the low end cost of rent for apartments in my area. Average cost of rent here is about $1,350-$1,500.

On paper, this all seems like a great idea to me. However, I'm young and dumb. I'm sure I've missed some critical issues, what ifs, be wary ofs, and whatever else folk face when buying their first home. So I turn to you all to persuade me in one direction or the other, continue renting, or go for this and buy a damn house already. Please tell me why or why not this is a good or bad idea.

personalfinance,Can I afford this car? In pretty decent financial shape edition...,"Hi,

I'm considering a new (or lightly used) car and am really struggling between my desire for the car and my desire to be frugal.  Tell me Reddit, what should I do here?

The car I want:

Cost:  80k financed, 12-1300/mo w/ low interest rate.

My financial situation:

* Demographics:  31, no kids, unmarried.
* Annual (pre-tax income):  120K salary, 45-75k stock compensation, 20-35k annual bonus.  
* Savings:  350k in post-tax investments, 150k in 401k.  IRA: 20k, Checking:  10k. 
* Major expenses:  $900/mo rent.  $450/mo car payment (that I'd be trading in for the new car).  $200/mo entertainment (going to movies, comedy shows, etc).  

So, that's me.  Most of my hobbies are pretty cheap, so other than the above and eating out a fair bit I try not to spend excessively.  The only exception is travel, where I currently budget $500/mo which goes unused since I work too much (60-80 hours a week) to go anywhere.   I max out my 401k and live entirely off my base pay, saving my stock compensation and bonus for investing.  

Long term, I expect my income to grow significantly.  Being very conservative for my industry, let's say 10%/year on average.  

Why I want the car:

I live in a city where there is no decent public transportation and driving is one of my great loves.  To me, there's nothing as peaceful and focusing as finding an open road and having just me and the road.  I even love commuting daily to work.  The drive is where I relax.  My current car is pretty nice, it cost about $50k new, but it's 3 years old now and I'm longing for something nicer.  It's currently worth about 24k and I owe about 25k on it, so basically a wash.  

So, tell me Reddit, what should I do?  Can I afford the 80k car?  Am I setting myself up to be broke one day?

We both make roughly $55,000 per year before taxes, i have $34,000 saved, but currently have $66,000 in student loan debt at 7% interest, making my minimum payments 850-900 per month. My girlfriend has roughly $20,000 saved and $20,000 in loan debt with roughly the same interest rate but her payments are right around $500 per month. Besides loan debt, our expenses at the moment are very minimal; she has a $150 monthly car payment, while we both pay roughly $60-70 a month for phone bills. We both live at home still, and our parents have been nice enough to allow us to live rent free while we try and save as much as possible. Because my girlfriend lives over an hour away from work, she is looking to move out sooner than later. We've laid out a few options that we think would be feasible:

Continue to live at home: Obviously this would be the most cost effective option. If we both stay at home another year, we could roughly save another $10,000 each to pad our savings in the hopes of later moving out. If we do purchase a home, it would preferably be in the $250,000 range. Staying another year to save would allow us to have a larger down payment. This is my preferred option, as it would give me time to pay down more of my student loans before taking on more debt as well. And with mortgage rates bound to rise, i feel as if the longer we wait, the higher rates will rise. 

Look to rent: This is my girlfriends preferred option, as it would move her 45 minutes closer to where we work. We feel like we could obtain a decent apartment for roughly $1300 a month. Many of the complexes in our area include sewer, trash, and water, while we would only have to pay for cable/internet and electric. Even though this would help out my girlfriend immensely, we would both save substantially less money, probably half of what we would if we waited another year.

1 is worth about 900k with 625k left on their mortgage at a 4.25 rate (3500 a month mortgage).
The other is fully paid off and worth a little north of 1 million.
The income from these investment properties total ~ 10k a month after factoring property taxes and before mortgage payments. (they've done pretty well for themselves)

Additionally they own a house worth about 700k with 120k left on their mortgage at a 2.75 rate (1200 a month mortgage). 

Would it be smart to refinance the house with a cash-out refinance and use the money taken out to pay off the investment property?

I figure they could borrow 500k (or more?) off the 700k house with a 10-year 3/1 or 5/1 arm at a much lower rate than the 4.25 (thirdfederal shows 2.1-2.5). 

Is there any gotchas with this approach that I don't see or anything different you would recommend?",finance,1430702537
personalfinance,Is a 5/1 ARM a good mortgage for me?,"I bought a home 1 year ago. It's a traditional 30 year VA loan with a 3.75% interest rate. I currently have about $25k in equity on the house right now, and living so close to the new Tesla Gigafactory, I'm fairly confident my value will at least stay level, if not increase a bit. I don't plan on keeping this home forever. I'm in the Navy, so we tend to move every 3 to 5 years. I keep getting these letters to refinance, no cost, under a 5/1 VA with 2.75 interest/2.78 apr. The interest rate is based on the 1 year treasury index. I would be able to cash out the loan and have money to do some upgrades to the house that would add to it's value and our enjoyment for the next 5 years, and it wouldn't cost me any more than what I'm already paying, maybe even slightly less. My issue is I know some people who lost their homes during the crisis when they're 5/1 ARMs matured and they couldn't keep up with the payments.

personalfinance,Paying off student loans: Higher Interest or Balance,"I have one private loan that has the highest interest rate of all my loans (5.97% variable) and two federal loans that are currently on an income-based repayment.

personalfinance,"I've recently started to pull my life together. I've made a good start, but the outlook is bleak. Please help me manage my debt and finish my degree.","Here's my recent background: I started college in 2009 and traveled half way across the country to attend a well respected, and expensive, state school (and if I'm being totally honest, to go on an extended adventure away from home) only to change majors in 2012 and move home to try to finish my bachelor's degree for much less money online. The program I enrolled in is designed around the idea that students are working while taking classes, so it's strictly part time enrollment. As you can imagine, there's a lot of emotional turbulence and psychological distress involved with this period of time that I'm not going to go into, but it was enough to cause me to drop out last semester, with roughly a year and a half of part-time school left to go. I started working retail to keep my car going and provide some much-needed distractions. At this point I hadn't seen the PF light and wasn't really tracking my finances at all. Unsurprisingly, as of April 1 I had about $2600 in credit card debt and like $100 in my checking account.  
  
Now for the good news: Through persistence and a huge helping of luck, I actually managed to get a really great job a month ago doing what I love for good money (~$50k in a Midwest metro area) even without a degree. It's been long enough since I've been in school, that my loans have gone into repayment. Details on the loans are below, but the gist is that I'm making enough money, and my living expenses are low enough (living with my folks, driving a late 90's beater sedan with over 220k miles) that I can absolutely afford to pay my loans at the agreed upon terms ... **and not make any kind of major purchase until I'm 35.**  
  
My car is old, it doesn't winter well (an important consideration in this area) and probably only has 2-3 years left in it. I'd also like to move out of my parents' house (we get along great and they don't have any plans to move, but I'm 25 and it's time) in the next 2-5 years. At the same time, I'm trying to build up an emergency fund (no progress) and use YNAB to stop living paycheck to paycheck (more success, I put away $800 last month towards a buffer)  
  
So, my situation's really not bad. It could be better, and I've certainly made some pretty huge screwups in the last 6 years which I'll probably be paying for for a long time, but things are looking OK. Here's what my monthly budget looks like. I fudged the numbers because I don't remember off hand, but I just went through everything yesterday so they should be pretty close :

Debt:  
Credit cards ($600 / month):  

* $500 @ 11% (100% utilization) paying $200 / month
* $1,500 @ 13% (80%+ utilization) paying $200 / month
* $600 @ 18.75% (This one's not mine, my mom bought me a suit and a week's worth of nice clothes to help me find a job. I agreed to pay the charges she incurred when I got a job) paying $200 /month  

Student Loans ranked by scariest first ($1400/month):  

* $8,000 @ 12.75% Fixed(co-signed by grandparents) Private. Minimum $100, paying $250.
* $45,000 @ 6.0% Fixed (co-signed by dad) Private. Minimum $400
* $30,000 @ 6.0% Fixed (Dad's PLUS loan, we made an agreement at the outset that I would pay this one). Minimum $400
* $25,000 @ 7.7% Variable (co-signed by dad) Private. Minimum $250
* $25,000 @ 4.75% Fixed Federal Direct Consolidation Loan. (Recent development, combined 10 or 11 different loans at different servicers and schools in an effort to reduce payments. The loan hasn't disbursed yet, so if this was a dumb idea let me know and I can do something about it in the next few days) Elected for Graduated repayment. Minimum $100  
  
Monthly expenses (~$930/month):  

* Cell phone: $25/month paying for my line of my parents' family plan
* Car insurance: $35/month paying for my contribution to my parents' insurance. They own the car and carry the insurance. I've never had an accident or ticket in 9 years, so I guess it doesn't cost much to keep me on their insurance. Seems suspiciously low to me though, I suspect my dad is secretly cutting me a deal. 
* Gas: $80/month. I drive about 40 miles everyday, and my car does ok on gas
* Tolls: $30/month. Not taking the highway adds 40 minutes to my commute each day.
* Online Services: $25/month. Google Play Music and Netflix provide entertainment, I also have a cheap-o VPS to host my blog and programming projects.
* Stupid Crap: $550/month. I have a food problem I'm going to talk to /r/loseit about. I also like to drink with my friends and take people to dinner. I'm going to try to cut this down to like $300 over the next couple months. 
* Work lunches: $150/month. See above regarding food problem. 
* Life Insurance: $36/month for $200k of 10-year term life insurance. I have enough debt with enough co-signers, and enough uncertainty about what's going to happen in the next 10 years that this is pretty much a must-have for me. I haven't actually bought the policy yet, but this is what I was quoted from USAA. Let me know if that sounds high, I haven't really shopped around. 

This leaves me with about $200 a month left for savings. Not all of these bills were due during April, so I was able to sock away about $800 to start my cash buffer. My priority right now is to nuke the credit card debt. While I was working retail I had a couple months where I was only getting enough hours to put gas in my car and pay 1 card. The card with a $500 balance has a 60-day delinquency within the last 6 months as a result. There was another 60-day delinquency about 6 months before that. The other card of mine has a clean payment history. I'm making decent progress here, and I believe June has a third bi-weekly pay check so I'll probably take that and finish off what's left of the cards. The bad payment history has really hurt my credit score. I bought my FICO score a few days ago using Experian data and it was 606. Clearly I'm not getting a car or apartment with that kind of credit. I expect this problem to mostly take care of itself after a year or two of consistently on time loan payments and 0-10% credit card utilization. I'm open to suggestions here. I'm thinking about opening a Discover IT card in the next year to try and boost my available credit and get the free monthly FICO score.  
  
Another concern is that my awesome company just signed me up for awesome health insurance. This is awesome because the copays are reasonable and I'm looking at a $500 deductible and $1500 out of pocket max. Not awesome because I wasn't given a choice of plan and there was no explanation of how much this is going to cost me. I'm basically waiting until my next paycheck (this week) to see how much is being withheld. In my employment agreement it says the company will pay ""Half of health care costs"". This is super vague and I don't like it. At our last company meeting, the owner told us he's looking into starting up a 401(k) plan with ""some kind of matching"", which is awesome. The only problem with these great benefits is that I really can't afford them. I can probably make health care work by stopping saving and trying to make progress towards reducing my ""Stupid Crap"" spending category, but assuming the 401(k) match is 3% that's another $115 a month I'm not going to be able to add to my emergency fund or put towards my loans.  
  
I guess my main question is whether there's anything I can do to reduce my student loan payments. That's my main pain point with nearly half of my take-home going towards my still-incomplete education.  
  
Which reminds me of the other thing. I still owe my school $2k in charges for basically walking out without saying anything last semester. I need to call and arrange payment terms this week. I haven't set anything up yet because until 2 days ago I really had no idea how much I could afford to pay. I still want to get my degree, if for no other reason than to have something to show for my $130k and years of emotional trauma. so when I go back I'll need to come up with about $600 per month each semester I'm in school. I think I can get it done in 3 semesters, maybe 4 if I continue to be stupid and unlucky. I'm a much better programmer than student, to put things mildly. I'd like to get back this summer or fall, before too much time has elapsed and I give in to the temptation to say ""fuck it"" and walk away.  

Well, that should do it. I tried to keep it short, but there's a lot going on here. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance,1430721806

I know 100% sure that I won't play them again - and am considering selling them and putting the money towards other interests (maybe a new kindle paperwhite, or put the money towards photography related items).

For example:

Metro Redux - completed on Hard - great game but I thought it was very depressing (great atmosphere!) - but I don't 'want' to play it again.

GTA5 - Finished on the ps3, then bought on the ps4 once completed and finished it again. My internet connection out here in the countryside is not good enough for online.

The Last of Us - same as above. Had it on ps3, loved it, completed it again on hard on the ps4 - and will likely never touch it again.

Wolfenstein - Absolutely loved this game (apart some of the boss fights!) and breezed through the game on hard in about a week - and will most likely never play it again.

Watch Dogs - bought this cheap second hand and quite enjoyed it (I had low expectations due to all the reviews).

I am currently working my way through Dragon Age Inquisition, and whilst it's a great game, I pretty much have to force myself to play through it and find many of the quests a chore (I am about 15 hours in, and only doing a few side quests, as I got fed up with many of the 'collect X amount of resource' related quests.

I also have Murdered: Soul Suspect, Minecraft &amp; Diablo 3 to properly 'get into' and they have sat virtually untouched on my shelf.

We previously lived in an apartment around this price but were forced to move due to a bed bug infestation that affects most affordable apartment buildings in this area.  To avoid having to share a room with bugs, we opted to move to a more expensive $1,600 month 2-bedroom apartment which includes all utilities (heat/hot water/electricity) and rent out the second bedroom to help afford the cost.

I basically have lived paycheck to paycheck for the past 10 years and occasionally taken small vacations when I had some money saved up.

Eventually I was taken to court on these bad debts and have started making payments, but at least I finally received a diagnosis - which has only made minor improvements to my health.

personalfinance,Oh gosh... What the heck should I say? Advice to give to sibling going to college with loans (x-post /r/studentloans),"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice to tell my brother about going back to school. Here’s his situation: he’s a music student, with an emphasis in production, and his dream is to be a video game score composer.

He’s in his mid-to-late-twenties, and got accepted to a few art colleges; the one he’s most interested would require him to move to San Francisco (we’re not from CA) to attend the Academy of Art University in SF. He has little to no savings and currently is working at customer service jobs to make ends meet. He currently also has a car loan with approx.. $1-2k left to pay back.

He received no financial aid, and the package they’ve quoted to him roughly looks like this (numbers slightly changed to protect… whatever needs protecting, I guess):

**Estimated cost of attendance: $41,350**

* Tuition &amp; Fees $21,000

* Room &amp; Board $15,000

* Books &amp; Supplies $1,850

* Transportation $1,000

* Personal Expenses $2,500 (and I think this sounds extremely low for SF)

**Estimated grant/federal loan: $15,900**

* Estimated Federal Pell Grant $5,800

* SEOG Grant $600

* Student Loan $9,500

**Estimated self-help required: $25,450**

This is a rough estimate, but it looks like he would have to take out over $25k every year (likely more) in private loans to return to do 4 years of college. What would you tell someone you cared about if they showed you this plan? And please, don’t hold back. I would like constructive reasons to help them figure out a path, and right now I find it extremely difficult to recommend this one.",finance,1430759625
personalfinance,"770 credit score, want 800 by 30","Hi PF! 

I'm almost 29, with a 770 credit score. I have this silly goal to hit 800 by the time I'm 30. Not sure if it is realistic.... but, how can I do that? 

Here's what I've done so far: 
1) Bought a car (used) paid it off. 
2) Paid off private student loans, and many federal. Have a bit more to go, however. 
3) Have about 8,000 credit limit currently available. (None maxed, paying off every month). Credit history averages 6 years, with oldest account at 10 years. 
4) No late charges on my credit report...

I just started my career, and make what works out to be about $45k/ year. Live with my fiance (his credit is another area we need to work on, he's like 620 O.o), and he made $70k last year, with more this year, just variable. We own both vehicles (but will need to buy another one here soon, as his is on it's last leg, and I need 4wd for my work).

While I'm working on helping improve his credit (I pay my ""half"" of the bills and do the budgeting, the extra money goes to paying his stuff off and will be paid off this month except student loans, and build an emergency fund, which we have one month of expenses in now), what else can I do to get my credit score higher? We rent our apartment, and I want to get a house in the upcoming years after we pay off everything (this month) and have an emergency fund. My income is pretty much ""extra"" so most of my income will go to savings.",finance,1430760079

personalfinance,Question on student loans and payment,"Reading the wiki and other online sources tells me that paying off loans with the highest interest rates is the most efficient method - but maybe I'm understanding this wrong. I have student loans through Navient and I'm looking to pay the most efficient way. 

First, I'm under the impression that interest accrues daily - that is, adds an amount to the principle - at a rate equal to principal * rate / 365.25 (Using a loan of 4000.00 and 6.8% interest rate as an example: 4000.00 * (6.80/100) / 365.25 = 0.7447 or so, or close to 75c a day). That is, roughly 75 cents gets added every day to my loan, unconditionally. Also assuming fixed interest rates, which I believe mine are.

So here is my situation.

Loan 1: 5213.00 @ 6.80%, ~97c a day

Loan 2: 4000.00 @ 6.80%, ~75c a day

Loan 3: 5000.00 @ 3.86%  ~53c a day

Loan 4: 7500.00 @ 3.86%  ~79c a day

Loan 5: 3750.00 @ 4.66%  ~48c a day


I think I did the math right, and this would lead me to believe I should pay off in this order:
1, 4, 2, 3, 5

When I looked for examples, though, a lot of examples weren't showing the math explicitly and just arranged them in order of percentage - meaning pay off the 6.8% loans first, then lower ones. However, unless I'm completely going wrong somewhere and I'm not seeing it, they really mean to calculate the per-day (or per month, or whatever) interest that accrues and pay the loan with the highest result off first. So instead of paying off loan 2 before loan 4, it would be the other way around since loan 4 is actually adding more money per day than loan 2 is.

Is this correct or do I have it all wrong?

Edit:

Also, if I'm not mistaken, every time I pay over the normal amount due, that amount goes to the principle, which means I should recalculate the values above every time I make overpayments to see which loan is currently adding the most interest per day.",finance,1430762270
personalfinance,A Question About the Avalanche Method of Loan Repayment,"I am about to complete my fourth year of graduate school in the US. I also worked full-time during those four years, so I have about $15k to pay down accrued interest before it capitalizes.

personalfinance,Keeping a small amount of debt to raise your credit score?,"Good Afternoon everyone,

Through some mistakes that my wife made a year ago, my credit score has became a low 686.

Currently, my car is paid off and my wife has been paying on her car which is in her name. We are blessed to be living in a house my father in law owns for a couple of years rent free until I get my VA loan in a year and a half and we can build. I do have student loan debt, but it's my understanding that federal loans are not related to credit scores. 

I currently have a credit card balance of 374 dollars. I don't have a problem with paying it off financially and have knocked out about 1000 off of it in a year. I do not want to close the count as credit cards can be handy ONLY in emergencies and I know the negative effects of closing the card. This card is the only debt I have on file with my FICO score. I don't know what goofy voodoo debt math they come up with to get these scores, but I'm worried about the consequences of paying  it off. Because the interest rate on the card is a small amount, is it worth to keep this debt lingering around to build my score back up? I have learned my lessons from credit cards, and aside from having one for an emergency, I won't be going in debt again with one.",finance,1430769773
personalfinance,Are we being ripped off?,"Hello everyone! 

My wife has had a loan through Wells Fargo for her car on a 72 month loan (the loan started in June of 09) and we are on the last payment. Last month the statement said she owed $724.87. We paid $500 of it which should have brought the principle down to $224.87. She just got her last statement and it's listing Current Payment, Total Amount and Loan Balance of $234.42. I mentioned it to her and she said she had suspected this was going on but wasn't sure (she never saves her statements and she's had the loan since before we met and has always paid it on time on her own so I have always stayed out of it mostly). My first thought was maybe interest, her interest rate is 12.99% APR, which, unless I'm doing my math wrong, is only 1.0825% monthly. So interest doesn't explain the difference. I tried to call but since I wasn't on the account, they refused to speak with me and she's working odd hours that make it difficult for her to call herself so I figured I'd ask you all about this until she is able to give them a call herself. 

I got online and looked at her last few payments and they don't add up either. There's always a 15-20 dollar discrepancy between what her principle should be after the last payment vs what they claim it to be. 


On the statements themselves there's no listing of billed interest, fees or anything beyond the last payment amount received, current payment due, total amount due and loan balance as of X-date. If it helps, the original loan amount was $12,154.16

She also mentioned that she has never paid just the minimum for the month. She always over pays atleast 20-30 dollars more so wouldn't that also have allowed her to have this paid off a while back? I just see it as a little convenient that after her overpaying for the last 6 years and noticing these hidden fees, that she just happens to be ending the loan at EXACTLY the 72 month mark. 

I don't claim to be an expert on the ins and outs of any of this by any means so I am really looking for clarification to see what I'm missing (if anything) and learn something in the process. Thanks!",finance,1430772529

personalfinance,"Excel Sheet Request: Mortgage, Student Loans, and other Debt Prioritization","Hi everyone,

As someone with a considerable amount of student loan debt ($100k+) at high interest rates (8% and 6.8%), I am still planning on purchasing a house for many of the reasons you're all familiar with (building equity over time), but am unsure if I should take out a 15-year mortgage and build more equity and pay less mortgage interest than a 30-year plan, or just take the 30-year mortgage and put all the extra money I would have put into the house into my student loan debt. I only plan on living in the house for about 8 years (not the magical 10 year line for a 30-year mortgage), so that's why I'm considering the 15-year fixed mortgage.

Where I was hoping for help from PF is - has anyone built a spreadsheet that I can use to analyze, over the long run, which is the better option? Ideally, I would be able to put my family income and other variables into the sheet, and it would tell me long run how much money to allocate to each loan. 

I am kind of a noob to all this, so I may not be understanding it correctly, but to me this isn't as straightforward as paying down the highest interest rate loans first, because I'm planning on moving in 7-8 years, and building equity over that time may be a better use of my money than paying more to the student loan debt. I did a google search and couldn't find any pertinent Excel workbooks that had quite the functionality I described above - and I thought maybe one of you gurus had made something like that for the community to use. 

I basically want to look at the math and answer this question - ""If, over 8 years of owning my house, I build ~$30k more in equity with a 15-year mortgage instead of the 30-year, will that be more than I will save in interest payments by putting the additional ~$750/month toward my student loans?""

I could really do with some help with the maths on this so I don't potentially mess this up.

I may be wrong but I could possibly be mortgage free by July next year by simply leaving my job!! As mad as it sounds the pay off I would get could put me mortgage free and my maths, whilst not bad, I just can't get my head around interest rates so I'm hoping someone can help (and point out potential pit falls)

I am currently on a 10 year FIXED mortgage at 3.59%

total borrowed was 97k....I am currently down to £94,500 (without interest which is calculated daily) so far we have made 3 payments (1x£1200 2X£1000) so have slightly over payed approx £200 (monthly payment is 963)

I am allowed to over pay 10% (so £9700) every 12 months

if I pay off early there is a redemption fee of 7% of whatever I pay off OVER the 10% I am allowed (so no fees till over the £9700)

Now.....I have after selling my campervan £20k in the bank

If I leave my job I will get a pay off of £60k however i MUST give a years notice so will obviously pay some of the mortgage off over that time (so at LEAST 12 further payments)

So I intend to do this

pay £9.5k off tomorrow (with previous over payment that takes me to 10% allowed) over payment

Mortgage drops to£83800 (no interest added)

pay 12 months off at £963 (obviously this is some capital and interest and the bit I am struggling with)

in March next year pay another £9.7k off overpayment

So mortgage would be £76100 MINUS whatever the normal monthly payments have reduced it by over the last 12 payments

then in July I shall have the £60k I get from giving up my job.

now This is where my maths lets me down as I can't get the figure of what potentially I would have left to pay (including redemption fee of 7%) that I would need to find in a years time (I can easily save £600 a month till then/sell the kids)


Some of you will say I am mad in giving up my job but I get a immediate pension of £1000 a month on leaving for life so that is not my concern (no more travelling, no more second car etc and no more mortgage) and will easily get another job...plus we have no other debts other than normal bills (the missus works)

can I do this???? am I mad???

Please help as potentially we could be mortgage free by the time I'm 42...but i want to make sure I am doing it correct....plus I NEED to start to have quality of life.

My current average monthly payment is **$702 per month** where I pay the minimum on most (except loan 5). Starting in December 2016, loan 5 (ECSI/XCEL) will increase to over $700 per month, which would result in a **new monthly payment of &gt;$1052.**

I also refinanced loan 5 into a $78,050 loan through Darien Rowayton Bank (**DRB 2**).
My options are: 

A) 15-year, 6.00% fixed, $659 monthly payment

C) 15-year, 4.01% variable, $578 monthly payment 

D) 20-year, 4.01% variable, $473 monthly payment 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Since my student loan through Navient is a variable loan and I’m happy with the progress so far, I’m considering doing the lowest time and variable loans. However I’m still concerned since the loan is “variable” and I don’t know much about Libor rates and the scandal or whatever. Also, most of my current loans are 10-year terms and I’m concerned that consolidating/refinancing will wash away any progress I’ve made for the first two years. 
&amp;nbsp;
Anyways, a few of my options that I see are: 

OPTION 1 (e, C, minimum monthly): $960 per month 

OPTION 2 (f, C, minimum monthly plus extra): $915 per month plus $35 to largest loan = $950 per month

OPTION 3 (f, D, minimum monthly plus extra): $810 per month plus $90 to largest loan = $900 per month

OPTION 4 (f, C, minimum monthly plus extra): $915 per month plus $35 to largest loan = $950 per month. Also $2k into Loan 2 (FedLoan) and $1k into Loan 3/4 (DRB 1).

OPTION 5-42: etc, ???, etc, ???

&amp;nbsp;

Other Notes: 
I want to decrease my debt, pay off my student loans, and increase my credit score (&gt;800). I’d like to buy a house and car but that doesn’t seem realistic till later in life. I know I could move back home and eat ramen for a few years but I enjoy my freedom from parents and I want to experience the world through food, entertainment, and travel. I don’t want to live in a cave working my student debt off so that I don’t experience the world and enjoy the moment. However, I don’t want to enjoy life too much so that later in life I won’t be able to afford a car or a house, or travel more. I’m using the app ‘mint’ to track my purchases and its helping. I’m slowly working on it but I know I should grocery shop more and make my meals rather than going out soo much. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Lastly… What looks better with regards to debt - fewer number of loans or less total debt (i.e. does 10 different loans equaling $10k, or one loan equaling $10k look better)? Should I pay back the largest interest rate first or the largest outstanding balance first? Should I even consolidate or refinance? What else?

So I need money quickly to pay for it. (choice of losing my license and maybe community service or hiring a lawyer, I chose lawyer) 

I figured it's be a good idea to consolidate my CC debt as well. So I applied to the bank where I had my car loan and they offered me 2 loans: 

3yr $4k higher interest rate 
3yr $7K lower interest rate if I refinance my car with them. 

I have no idea what that implies except possibly losing my car if I don't pay. The 4K would wipe out 95% of the CC debt but then I'd have to put the 2K of court back on the CCs. Is it worth refinancing my car to keep the balance off my Credit cards?

finance,Modeling IRR for Various Scenarios - Where to Start,"I am wanting to do an IRR analysis for various paths to take given the following scenario:

Company A is a partial owner of Company B at X%. Company B needs a one-time capital injection of $10M to bridge them month-to-month coming up. There are three paths that Company B can take to obtaining the bridge:

* Get a loan from the bank at 10% interest 
* Company A provides the cash through a convertible note
* Company A acts as the bank through a plain vanilla loan for Company B

I have the cash flows projected for the next four years and have obtained valuations for the business (Company B) through a DCF analysis and an EBITDA multiple.

Bitcoin,Review of BITSEED PERSONAL SERVER - BITCOIN EDITION by Bitseed.org,"When I first saw a review about the Bitseed Personal Node, I scoffed at the idea thinking I can run one much cheaper that $150. I then started to think and realized I had been paying $40 a month for server fees hosting my own node on the cloud. 


I looked a little deeper into the product and company and ultimately decided to purchase one. Here is my review...


I went to the website, placed my order, payed with PayPal and got a confirmation email moments later. That following Wednesday the product shipped and was at my front door by Saturday. (could have been sooner but USPS is a bit slow processing packages where I live).


The setup was extremely simple. I plugged in my mouse and keyboard, connected HDMI and plugged it into the power source. Within seconds the node was powered on and showed a simple Linux Ubuntu Linero homescreen.


The node consists of a Rasberry Pi-like PC Board (ARM) with a 160GB hard drive tacked on and a custom case. It is an extremely simple design but has a lot of potential. On board is 1GB Ram and a 4GB Flash used for the OS. The package came with very simple instructions to set up your profile for the Bitnodes Incentive Program and optional GUI for Bitcoin Core. The node also comes equipped with Chromium web browser as well as some other options to customize the look and feel of the desktop.


I had reached out to support for a question about shipping via twitter and was surprised to receive an email from the CEO of the company with my tracking info a day later. The CEO is Jay Feldis and after some back and forth emails I asked him for permission to use his name in this review. He sent me some information about himself as well as a review from what I am assuming to be one of his colleges. Here it is.... 


&gt;""I am effectively CEO/CTO at this point. Our website is at www.bitseed.org, but we will be launching a new website in the next 24hrs and there will be additional info on it. Stay tuned.

&gt;We have set up a project on the assembly.com platform to encourage developers to create software for the device and reward them with a portion of the sales proceeds https://assembly.com/bitseed  This is a good way to get involved and is open to anyone who can add something

His experience includes key roles leading hardware, software, and program management teams through all stages of development from product conception and system design to manufacturing and retail launch. Jay holds a BSEE of Cornell University.""*.


I had a very good conversation with the CEO and felt he was very personable and helpful. We emailed back and forth for about 12 hours and even until 4AM! He has a great vision for the company and is very approachable and easy to talk to. Because of the great interaction I had with Jay, I have already purchased a second node and will use one for its primary purpose and the other to load alternate OS on it to see how it works for other things.


I really enjoy the simplicity of nodes design as well as the customer service I have received. I am very excited for a second generation of this product and plan to keep in communication with the company with any future developments.

personalfinance,"Building credit, question about late student loan payment","I'm 25 years old, I got a job a year ago starting at $110k, two months ago I got a new job at $130k. I still have $15k in student loans. And my current credit score is 427. I would like to fix my credit ASAP.

I was two quarters away from graduating when my mom fell off a ladder and broke her leg, her foot snapped completely from her leg, and two weeks later my father was in the hospital for a few weeks over his failing kidneys. Thankfully they both signed up for Obamacare a month before. They are both doing much better except my father, he has to go to Dialysis three times a week and its taking a toll on him

The family business revenue dropped over 50%, and we were worried about the mortgage, parents health, my other two brothers tuition, etc. I decided to stop studying and get a job. During that time the paychecks were paying back family that helped with tuition, paying my parents mortgage, and helping my family and friends(they’re my friends, but think of them as brothers, friends with both for 20 years with one, and 14 with the other). I didn’t make a payment on my fed loan for five months, I know, VERY stupid.

I don’t have much of a credit history. Everything was always purchased in cash: cars, motorcycle, laptop, clothes, etc. If there was something out of my reach, my immediate family could loan me money, and I'd pay them back.

The only history I have, was a $8 library fine that I carelessly go to collections, and a 10 year checking account with BoA. The earlier mentioned late FedLoan payment.

Last year after I got a job, I signed up with a local credit union. After 2 months of direct deposits, I applied for a credit card, I was rejected.

I forgot about it and went on with my life. Now that my life is much more settled, my finances are in check, and I’m not living paycheck to paycheck, I’ve been thinking about the future. I want to purchase a house and buy a nice car. 

But I have to build my credit up before I can even think about purchasing a house or a nice car.

I wanted to know if there was anyway I could do in regards of my late payments with Fed Loans, I’ve talked to them recently and have got payments set up so that I’ll pay off my loan within a year.

I’ll be going to my credit union tomorrow to apply for a secure card.

Are there any other steps I can take to fix my credit?",finance,1430796494
personalfinance,First credit card question....,"Hello,

I'm 24, recently got a bank account and I think it's time to get a credit card. I do not have a credit history, but I have a co-signer with OK credit. 

I really have one question, assuming I can get a card with 0% for an introductory period of XX months, is there really a reason not to carry a balance? Will it murder my credit score even if I'm paying above minimum? 

To be honest I am looking at buying a car trailer with the intention of using it as another source of income. I already own a capable truck for it. 

The dealer offered me 29% interest rate. Ridiculous on a $2500 item. I have not called around to many other dealers, but I don't have high hopes. So I am considering paying what I can cash, and the rest on a credit card and paying off $200-300 a month until it's gone. It will be paid off before the 0% interest is over and after that I will just use the card to build credit.  

If any of it matters I've never had any debt, I am pretty much just a cash person. No rent but help out with a few family bills, I am paid cash under the table. I budget pretty well but can't seem to find $2500+ at once. I've got around $800 saved up right now.

Honestly after I typed all this I realized I probably can't even get a card with like a 2-3k limit as my first unless my cosigner has fantastic credit. But I'll hit submit anyway just in case.

personalfinance,Should I open a High-Yield savings account with my ~6k Savings?,"Hello.

I just got my first real ""big boy"" job, and have saved up about 6k, which I plan to have as an emergency fund/general savings.

I currently have it in the Chase Savings account that I have had for many many years ever since my parents first help me set up a bank account. But I can't help but notice how abysmal the interest rate is - In April I made a record $0.04 interest. About 0.007% interest rate. Wowzers!

I recently saw some ads for high-yield savings accounts. I know next-to-nothing about them... so I must wonder what the catch is? Why would anyone use Chase for savings when other banks offer literally 100x the interest rate.

I saw an ad on Mint which led me to find this list here:

http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/nerdwallets-top-high-yield-online-savings-accounts/

Would it be wise for me to transfer most (say, 5k) of my savings over to one of those accounts? Has anyone opened a high-yield savings account recently with one of the guys mentioned in that list?

Is there any catch? Is there anything that can trip up a novice and cost them money? I am aware there are things like minimum balances or perhaps a debit card you need to use a few times each month, but those seem like incredibly small inconveniences for actually having my savings grow with time.

personalfinance,"23yr old, needing advice on loans and budgeting!","Hello PF,

So as stated I am a 23 year old post graduate of college. I am currently working for a city government in their parks department. I make roughly 35k a year. In reality I take home exactly $1,054.00 every two weeks. I own my car outright although I do owe my parents 5k for it, I can pay this back at any time. I am currently living with my parents and they are not charging me for rent(very lucky).

My debt is held by Great Lakes Borrower Services, and totals $35,000. The loans are split between two sections by Great Lakes(GL). The first is 30k and the second is 4k and some change in between. The 4k loan is on a 6.8% interest rate and the 30k has varying interest rates making it up with the highest being 6.8%. I currently am set up for auto pay which goals against the principle and not the interest. I can pay extra against whatever I choose but have to pay down the interest before I can go against any principle.

I currently have 7k in my bank account. My plan is to every month wait until the day before my first paycheck of the month will hit and then pay whatever I have in the bank account above 2k into my loans. This way I have the 2k as an emergency fund. I forgot to mention earlier that I take $100 out of every paycheck and it goes instantly into savings. My plan with my savings is to let it grow to 7k then pay my parents the 5k I owe them.

personalfinance,Can I take out a student loan and pay it off over the year with whatever money I can earn?,"Okay, I'm going to college. I've got a wierd situation, long story short is I'm 21 with relatively little money, half my tuition covered by federal loans and grants, and nothing at all coming from my family. I'm going for a computer science degree, so I'm not afraid to take on significant but reasonable debt. 

I'm going to CU in Boulder.
In state tuition is roughly 11.3k for the year, plus an estimated 1800 for books (though I'm sure I can do that for a lot cheaper). I've budgeted about $1500 a month for living expenses. So I'm looking at a little over 30k that I need for the year. I got offered roughly 7k from the FAFSA, due to my age. So that 23k, I've gotta make that come from somewhere, and I've thoroughly examined my options, it looks like that somewhere is going to be a private student loan.

Now, I expect to be working at least 20 hours a week for at least 15 bucks an hour (I've got a few years of work experience, some marketable skills etc.) But I can't guaruntee that as far as the admissions office (who is currently grilling my finances to qualify me for in state tuition) is concerned, so I'm pretty sure they're going to require me to take the money out as a loan.

So my question, and **TL;DR** If I take out 25k in private student loans for this year, can I just pay off the bulk of it with the 20k or so I expect to earn this year? As in, I made $1200 last month so I'm gonna cut Sallie Mae a $1200 check.

personalfinance,Question about a loan and proof of income,"This post is about my parents. 
My dad was in the oilfield and got laid off in February this year. 
While my mom is still working, the amount of unemployment my dad is receiving isn't enough. He's been doing jobs on the side for extra cash and is coming close to what he was making before. 
Now, he got a letter in the mail today saying he was pre approved for a loan of $410,000. 
On the back, it gave him an interest rate of 3.9% on a loan of 220,000 with payments of 1,590. 
Just with the $220,000, he would be able to pay off the house and both his and my mothers vehicles. Which are the largest bills they have together. 
If he does try to go through with the loan, how can he show proof of income if what he's making from unemployment isn't much? How can he prove that he's been doing jobs on the side for cash? 
Would there be a way to add my mom to the loan just for her income? 
This would be very helpful for them. My mom could afford the loan payment easily by herself.

* 40% Global stocks (**VWRD**) (or is it **VWRL?**)
* 25% European stocks (**IMEU** or **VEUR**)

Forex,Aussie bulls show remarkable resilience post rate cut,"Today Reserve bank of Australia (RBA) delivered 25 basis points rate cut bringing RBA's benchmark lending rate to 2%. Aussie lost ground initially however bulls showed remarkable resilience and pushed the pair to new intraday high.

Key highlights from RBA policy -

* RBA recognizes improvement in household demand and overall employment. However remain concern over business capital expenditure in both mining and non-mining sector. RBA expects lower capital expenditure along with subdued public spending would keep economic activity somewhat subdued for the next one or two years.
* While low interest rates would continue to be supportive of borrowing and spending according to RBA, it might also be contributing to higher property prices. Real estate prices are rising sharply in Sydney, for which RBA is working with regulators to contain the risk.
* RBA doesn't see any threat of high inflation arising from lower exchange rate, on the contrary according to RBA, Aussie might fall further against pairs other than dollar.
Aussie traded dropped to 0.7784 from 0.7852 after the announcement, however recover soon and traded around 0.792, three day high within moments.

As of now, it seems that bulls seems pretty strong, however it is too early to say that bears have given up completely as they defended 0.80 key resistance area well. Wait and watch is advised with less positions as price might consolidate here. This week's NFP report might lead to a breakout.

There is background, I tried to explain, but am lacking in personal finance knowledge.","When I was 18 I went to college for about two months before I took a leave of absence for depression/mental illness. I thought I would be going back, but living with my bipolar, verbally abusive father, things finally reached a tipping point. He kicked me out (over something stupid) and around March 26, 2014 I left home. I moved around with friends and family  for a few months, and as of Oct., 2014 I have been on my brother's couch. During this time I did little work. Little things here and there like dogsitting, and sign waving, and selling a few things. Mostly though being supported by others. My mother initially left with us (he kicked us all out my brothers, my mom, and myself). But because of her weak emotional, dependent, and abused complex, keeps going back to him. Because of all of this I put aside thinking about going back to school anytime soon.

I have spent most of the time in a depressive stupor. Just sleeping, tv, internet. I've slowly made progress emotionally and feel better. I have tried to occupy myself with art and other things and got myself a job recently. I am very proud of myself for coming out of many lows, I'm doing very well for once being suicidal.

I am now in talks with the University to figure out the next steps for a possible return for me. I have a meeting May 29th with service center and financial aid office. 

What I need help with is: End of Feb. 2014-March 26(ish) 2014 I was working and made a little bit of money. I filed for my tax return because I knew I'd be getting back at least a little money and I assumed since I have not been living with my dad, he hasn't been giving me money that he would not claim me as a dependent. I filed before him, and wouldntcha know he tried to claim me so he blew up at me when there was a problem with his taxes. Crazy stuff aside, he said no one else has given more than half of my support besides him. Which is just not true. I figured I was in the right, but because I only got 33.00 back and my Dad is gonna deal with more money consequences (and just to shut him up) I said I would amend mine. I have not gotten around to it yet, and assume I will be paying some penalty as well. He let me know this happened April 14th 2015. Technically it is not right for me to amend and for him to claim me, I think. I am not sure because he did take out a loan for my college, but it was in his name. I have been making the payments on my federal loans, mainly from selling stuff and borrowing from my brother.

What I want to know is if I should wait longer to amend and first talk to Financial Aid Office about whether my being claimed by my father for 2014 will have an affect on my financial aid, or maybe a possible homeless status I am going to ask about. 

My Dad talked big scary words to me about how he's been doing taxes for 20 years and such and I tried to tell him my logic for claiming myself, but he has more to lose and told me he will just let the IRS audit the case and he will win or whatever and I will have to pay all the penalties (I am dirt poor so this would not be ideal).

When I apply for financial aid I want to do so as a dependant. My father is toxic and has proven not dependable on whether or not  he will pay for my school (depends on whether or not he is mad at me). I do not want him involved in my life. I don't want to have to pull out the big guns and appeal for my dependance to the financial aid office. There are probably at least two police reports for domestic disputes I could pull up and prove that my home is unsafe or some shit.  I am just ready to live in squalor and take on a large amount of debt and get my life started. I have a better support system as well and can get help from other relatives. I want to move on in my life, and away from letting my dad control any aspect of it.

I'm a university student in Australia in my final year of study. I have about $3000 to my name, with no significant expenses or debts (living at home). I've also stopped working part-time this year to focus on my thesis so I don't really have any income apart from some cash from my parents every now and then. 

Recently I got the surprising (and honestly very overwhelming) news that I'd been accepted into a graduate program with a prestigious employer after I finish university, with a starting salary over $100 000. 

Because I have this guaranteed income for the next two years, I'm pretty keen to start taking advantage of it right away. I want to travel at the end of the year, and I also want to purchase a motorbike I've had my eye on for a while. I estimate I'll probably need about $10,000 to fund these ideas.

My question is this: is it possible to take out a loan when I won't be able to begin repaying it until February next year? Would it be better to take out a credit card instead? I understand it all comes down to interest rates, but are there any other factors I need to take into consideration?

Yearly, my wife and I bring in the following (gross):

* Me: $81k/yr
* Wife: $65k/yr

My wife and I have two outstanding debts:

* A home mortgage with $154k remaining at 4.125% (fixed), minimum payment of $1380/mo. We are focusing on this loan, and are paying an extra $700/mo on it
* A private student loan with $51k remaining at 3.170% (variable but capped at 3.5%) with minimum payment of $557/mo

Given the relatively low interest rates on each, I have also been investing.

* $70/mo into VPAIX (we are over the 25% tax level)
* $230/mo split across a diversified investment portfolio (EWX, PID, SCHA, SCHM, VNQ, VONV, VOOG)
* ~$200/mo into a company ESPP (15% discount off ticker price of first or last day of fiscal quarter, whichever is lower)
* $28/mo into I-series treasury bonds (don't laugh :) )

I am not including 401k/403b/pension payments here. We both are contributing the max matched amount our employers allow, and I add about $150 extra a month to a roth 401k.

So, my real question is, given the amounts we are contributing, loan payoff calculators show an estimated debt-free date of Oct 2022 using Avalanche, with $31k total interest. Using snowball, I AGAIN see Oct 2022 but with $32k of total interest. Other than ~$1k interest, the only real difference is that with snowball I get back the additional $557/mo from the smaller loan by the end of 2018. Having the extra cashflow every month would be useful. That would be nice, especially since the wife and I are starting to discuss kids and by that time we'd be looking at daycare costs, clothing, etc. The cashflow would be nice - nice enough that I think I'd be willing to pay the extra 1k/mo for flexibility. Getting rid of investing entirely in the meantime would at best change the ""debt free"" date by approximately 1 year.

Note that this does not include any windfalls; tax returns usually are around $6k/yr for us (this should shrink as interest goes down), I get a yearly bonus of about $4k, etc, so the date will likely be sooner. Usually this all gets pointed at loans or large purchases (if we have them). It also does not include yearly cost of living wage increases. Any wage increase we get we have been directing at paying off loans.

I just want to get some feedback from other folks about how they'd handle this situation. Given the possibility of a kid in the next year or two, is it better to eat the extra ~$1k of interest and go for a snowball approach and free up that student loan cash flow in 2-3 years? $557/mo is about 5/8ths of the cost of daycare in our area. Or should I let the math guide me and stick with an avalanche approach and not get back ANY additional cashflow until the early 2020s?",finance,1430837005
investing,"Carl Icahn positioning for correction and is ""very hedged"". Concerned about the stock market and high yield bonds.","The link is below.  I've transcribed his comments about the markets that I believe are relevant to a discussion.  

For Discussion: Is there a catalyst for rising default rates in the high yield market?  Can further sinking to come in treasury yields explain the narrow credit spreads?

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/havent-heard-carl-icahn-bearish-135555073.html

Icahn: I’m very concerned about the market.  You have a situation where this market keeps going up and up, with zero interest rates, that’s what keeps pushing it up and up.  And yet a lot of the economic news isn’t all that good. And also, perhaps more importantly, earnings aren’t that good.  And you have the S&amp;P trading at 17x, 18x multiples.  And you wouldn’t buy a stock at 18 times that you believe earnings would go down 3%.  

(Anthony Scaramucci asks “Are you positioned for a correction?”)

Yes, we are very hedged.

What’s even more dangerous than the stock market is the high yield market—the junk bond market.  It’s ridiculously high.  For a couple of reasons, default rates are going to go up in this market, and people buy it.  They’re buying the yield and they really believe that bonds will go up.  But when they start coming down, there’s going to be a great run to the exits.  And what’s going to be worse, than even in 08, you had a bit of a safety desk with the prop desks at banks.  Today with the Volker rule, there’s no catching it.

High yields shouldn’t be at the levels they’re at.  Only 3% above treasuries, the credit spread is way too narrow.  

What if the market does really crash?  People say it can’t happen, it’s not going happen.  You’re not going to have ‘08 again.  I remember in ‘07, it’s very similar, it’s like deja vu, I was very concerned in ‘07.  The irony is that, back in ‘07, everybody knew that the housing bubble was going to burst.  But everybody was thinking, “well wait”.  

I can’t tell you it’s going to be ‘08.  I can’t predict year to year.  Anybody who does is a fool.

I cant roll the IRAs over but I confirmed with the annuity company that I can roll over the annuity into another investment account if I choose (it has a decent interest rate right now and it's making me around $600 a year). 

I have a lot of student loan debt ($25,000 private and $40,000 federal) and I was debating on using some of this money to pay down some of my loans.

So now I have 4 credit cards. 3 of them I won't be using anymore, and this new one will be my main card. I see no reason to close the old ones out, because it was my understanding that having available credit improves my debt to income ratio. This is good for your credit score, correct? I plan on continuing to open new cards every year or so for the cash back rewards.

I pay off the balance on my cards every month. I've never paid any interest on these cards ever. This last card will probably carry a balance, due to stuff, but It should be paid off by the end of summer. Again, that's why I got a 0% introductory rate card.",finance,1430845541

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Innovators of Today May Become the Government Scapegoats of Tomorrow,"This morning I was reading about zero-interest-rate-policies (ZIRP) and negative-interest-rate-policies (NIRP) that are increasingly in vogue today; and the author's conclusion that these policies will invariably lead to the abolishing of cash. The argument went like this: if interest rates on deposits become *too* negative (more than a few percent) there will be bank runs -- much better to have cash under a mattress. This will cause the authorities to increasingly vilify cash.

One of the comments speculated that the people ""would create their own money"" to avoid such restrictions. Whether this money was bottle caps or cigarettes or whatnot didn't matter -- what mattered is that some market-created alternative would spring into being. The commenter obviously didn't know about Bitcoin.

So what will happen when the crypto-alternative Bitcoin becomes more popular? It will skirt any restrictions that the government has enacted and, furthermore, will enrich those who hold and use it because of its deflationary nature. Aren't the powers-that-be going to demonize it? Aren't they going to blame it for all the ""trouble"" it causes (them)? Even if it was their own policies that really caused the trouble?

I think there's a possibility that payment processors and exchanges will be branded the cause of whatever sovereign turmoil comes. They may even be shut down, and those entrepreneurs who started and developed these services may be scapegoated as the ""origin of all the societal problems we see accelerating throughout the world.""

Of course, once Bitcoin becomes popular enough then even if exchanges are shut down there is no way to stop individuals from performing their services and selling their goods for Bitcoin. The economy simply becomes ""Bitcoin closed looped"" faster.

But for those entrepreneurs who, in the opinion of the government, ""started the whole mess"" there may be difficult times ahead nonetheless.",cryptocurrency,1430846124

personalfinance,$100k Trust Inheritance - Just Let it Be?,"A couple years back my grandmother distributed a trust to all her grandchildren. It was around $1 million split 16 ways, so I wound up with around $60k. Like most of the grandchildren I elected to just leave it with the current administrator, and I believe the balance has grown to around $90k since then. I will have the most recent statement of holdings on Friday.

I'm 28 years old and fairly well off. I have no student/car/CC debt. I make $100k a year working in a management role in corporate finance. My job is fairly easy and has good upward mobility into the $130k/year range over the next few years, but is not where I will be working in 5 years.

I do own a 2 family house valued at approximately $800,000, and I owe $480,000 on the mortgage. Purchase price was $550,000. My house payment is around $3,800 a month including mortgage, taxes, and insurance. I rent the house to young working professionals for $5,200 a month. The property values in my area have increased substantially over the last 6 years and condo conversions are very popular.

As a person I am exceptionally risk tolerant when it comes to money. As long as I feel that I am being correctly compensated for my risk, I will pretty much always be drawn to the riskiest option. When I bought my house 6 years ago I had no problem dropping every cent that I had (and borrowing plenty from a well-off friend at a high interest rate) in order to make my down payment. I am actually annoyed by how much equity I have in my house right now because it means that while my position is safer, I am not fully levered and thus am not maximizing my returns.

So after ignoring this bit of money for the last couple years, I am starting to consider what to do with it. I see three main options:

1. Leave it with the current administrators, or take the money elsewhere so I can achieve a more personalized investment strategy. Either way, a totally hands-off capital market investment.

2. Cash in the trust. Take the capital and invest it in condominiumizing my house. Sell the condos. Based on recent condo transactions in my area, I think I could net at least $50k by doing this. But it would be a lot of work and would potentially leave me with a substantial tax burden at the end.

3. Invest in a small business. I know a lot about retail finance and inventory management. I could probably run a convenience store on a few hours a week. Or some small clothing boutique if I could find trustworthy labor on even less.

To complicate things a bit, I don't know how long I'm going to continue to live in my area. 2 more years at minimum, but beyond that if I choose to relocate I'll probably be moving thousands of miles away.

So what steps should I take to start getting these things sorted out? Even though I'm relatively financially minded, I must admit that taxes are a big blind spot for me so I haven't really given them much thought.",finance,1430852087

I have approximately 4k that I saved up from a part time job my senior year of high school. 


I virtually have no expenses except eating out, clothes, events and other miscellaneous items such as technology or expenses for the animals I foster. 


My parents gave me their old car and they also pay for the gas/insurance, they feed me, and I still live with them.


I go to a community college for free through financial aid and scholarships, I get about 1-3k each semester (depends on summer terms) of left over financial aid and scholarship money. Meaning in an entire academic year, I get approx 10k in left over money. 


I plan on getting an internship (most likely unpaid) so I won't get a job any time soon, unless the internship itself is paid.


I save a lot of money, since I don't have much expenditures. I've invested in stocks when I was younger and it went from 400 dollars to now $4,252. I do not plan on withdrawing any of that money until much, much later.


I'm also a very frugal person. I make spent approx. 1k from 2013-2015 on my own expenses (concerts, eating out, clothing, technology) and plus, my parents mostly take care of me.


**What I was planning on doing.**



I plan on getting beginning a ROTH IRA (if I qualify?? Not sure with which company either) to invest the left over financial aid money/scholarship money into since I do not use it.


I also plan on getting a credit card to make little expenses with so I can begin building my credit.



I'm not sure if I would need to pay some sort if interest rate on either of these things. I understand for the credit card I would if my payments were late or exceeded. I will go to an advisor at my bank to speak to them. But I'm not sure about the IRA.

personalfinance,My employer is asking me to pay back a hotel I did not stay at because I didn't abide by their impossible to follow cancellation policy.,"Like the title said, I work for a state agency (but am an Americorps volunteer, so a federal, stipend position), and I had booked to stay at a hotel for a few nights while gone on a work trip. I booked five days ahead of the day I was supposed to arrive. It ended up not being necessary because a friend who lived in the town let me stay at his house, but didn't let me know until the night before I was supposed to check in(This was late saturday night). But I didn't contact the hotel until the morning after I was supposed to check in (Monday morning), I didn't have their number or reservation information on me, and I really just didn't get around to doing it, that was my bad I know.

I talked to the management the next morning and told them I didn't have access to the state car so that is why I didn't make it (it was a white lie, I didn't want to just tell the lady I had a different place to stay in town). She seemed annoyed but didn't really say anything and hung up pretty quickly.

A few weeks later my supervisor sends me an email with the bill, they had charged the state for the full stay and wrote ""no show"" on the receipt. I didn't tell my supervisor that I had lied to the hotel about why I didn't show up, I just told him I cancelled with them Monday morning. My supervisor requested I ask them if they would forgive the full late penalty, but the hotel hasn't seemed interested in doing so.

I only booked the hotel room five days ahead of time, but it turns out their policy for a full refund is canceling two weeks ahead of your reservation. I was not notified of that policy when I made the reservation or when I cancelled it, it isn't posted on their website or anywhere online, it was only on the receipt they sent to our office a few hours I had booked it over the phone. So really it turns out I would have been screwed no matter what I did.

This is all understandable in some way, but now my supervisor is telling me I might be responsible for the hotel bill because I didn't abide by the cancellation policy (which was impossible to do in these circumstances). If they hadn't put on there I was a no show, no one would have even known I wasn't there.

I'm wondering whether it's possible and feasible to refile my 2013 tax return to get either A) a refund for the $600 B) the full amount that I should have been owed as a refund C) the educational credit or D) all the above.

I would prefer D, obviously. Am I an idiot?",finance,1430870806
personalfinance,What is your mortgage payoff strategy?,"I'm 25 and about to purchase my first home on June 1st. I qualified for a 3.75% interest rate so (after 20% down) the payment on a 30 year loan comes out to $479.79. This is about 14% of my take-home pay each month. My boyfriend and I live together, so unless something happens and we break up, I'll really only be spending 7% of my income on the mortgage (since he'll be paying for half).

I know that 3.75% is a really low rate, and most people say that anything below 4% doesn't need to be paid off early. Would you still contribute extra money towards the mortgage each month to pay it off early?

Does anyone make extra payments every two weeks?  Would it be better, for example, to pay an extra $100 every two weeks rather than $200 extra every month?

personalfinance,Starting My First Independent Checking/Savings,"**Long post warning**

*Context*: 

I am college student living at home with my parents. Due to a history that I can't/don't want to fully elaborate on, the end result is that they pay for my tuition and let me live at home with no rent or other expense. 

In exchange I hand over my paychecks from whatever job(s) I have, in full, and receive an $80 per month allowance in the form of a debit card linked to their account, but under my name. Any money I don't spend from that $80 is given to me in cash to save.

I have a good relationship with my parents and have no objections to this. My non-essential expenses are far below $80/month, so I don't mind.

*The problem*:

I want to open a checking and/or savings account with the $500+ that I essentially have under a mattress. I went to the BoA near my house (where my parents also do their banking) to ask about their options considering my situation. The options they recommended for [checking](https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/checking/personal-checking-account.go) and [savings](https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/savings/regular-savings-account.go#footnote4) look okay to me, but I wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Here are some of my main questions:

*The interest rate on the info-sheet they showed me for the savings account was listed as ""Variable"". What does that mean, exactly?

*I understand what APY means, more or less. But after looking at other options at other banks I've seen examples where the Dividend Rate and the APY were the same, which I don't understand mathematically. What am I missing? Why is BoA only giving me the APY and no other info (DR, compounding period, etc)?

*Ultimately, is this a good idea to go with? I live in San Francisco. Are there any alternatives that you would suggest?

Any input is welcome, and I thank you in advance for your help.",finance,1430877870

personalfinance,Need Help Planning for Math Teacher Loan Forgiveness,"Daily reader and occasional commenter making her first post here! I need help planning to take the teacher loan forgiveness. It doesn't seem to be too hot of a topic here and I’m wondering how strategies are different from PSLF.

So the basics are that I have about $20,000 in federal subsidized loans and am graduating in 2 weeks with a teaching credential (already have bachelor’s). I’m going to be teaching high school math and my credential presents me as a “highly qualified teacher”. I also already have a job lined up in the fall at a public charter school (my first pick!) which receives title I funds. I’ll be placed on the salary schedule and will be making 45k my first year and it will go up 1-2k each year. My budget and spending are in good control, so let's leave that for another discussion. This is the only debt I have.

All of that information combined means that after 5 years of teaching here I will be eligible for $17,500 in teacher loan forgiveness! Knowing that I will be eligible for this makes me want to maximize the amount I can have forgiven, much like those who are targeting PSLF in 10 years. 

My loans are serviced through Great lakes and if I were on the 10 year standard repayment plan I would pay $213 a month. The only income based repayment plan I think I’m eligible for is income contingent and that would lower it to $193. I could also go graduated which starts at $149 for 2 years, then $173 and finally $213 for the year before it gets forgiven. I’m thinking this is the option for me. I’m only skeptical because if after 3 years of teaching I get burnt out (50% of us do) I would have been making these measly payments for 3 years and still have substantial loan amounts to pay off. I’m thinking the extra interest accrued in that time is worth it if the potential payout is $17500 of free money.    

I would really like your input if all of the above information sounds like a solid track to be on. I've heard rumors that sometimes your loan provider will allow you to go into forbearance during your 5th year of in service teaching if the amount of money currently on your loan would be completely paid off by the loan forgiveness. Does anyone have information on that? Also, if I take out new loans in the 5 year period, do they get forgiven? By my rough calculations, I will have well below the maximum allowed forgiven if I make payments for 5 years. Pursuing a master’s degree part time while teaching in the next 5 years is a possibility and would be even more so if any loans I took out would be forgiven only a few years later.  

Details on loans:  
$3500 at 5.6%  
$3837 at 4.5%

personalfinance,High School senior staring at 100k in future student loan debt. I have a rough plan but am looking for advice/wisdom.,"Hi PF. After getting rejected :( by some of the more elite universities out there that promise better financial aid for families like mine, I'm left with making the best out of my in-state school UCONN (University of Connecticut). WARNING: Long post incoming!!! (sorry about that) 

UCONN estimates their total cost of attendance for one year to be $30k and has offered me $5k in merit grants, and the rest in federal loans. So with $100k worth of debt looming on the horizon, I'm now looking for strategies to (1.) minimize my dependance on loans while in college, and (2.) get a feel for how sizable student loan debt might affect some of my life decisions post-bachelors degree. 

1 = Reduce financial dependance on loans while at college. Some things I've considered but am seeking advice/experience with: 

Getting a part-time job: I'll be an economics major most-likely (also considering math/comp sci however). I'd like to intern in investment banking for a summer or two, but don't know if I'll break in to the industry due to networking unpredictability and my school. Any other econ/business jobs (non-marketing) out there for college kids that pay reasonably, and look impressive on a resume? If I don't do computer science, I've also been looking into taking a summer or semester off to do a coding bootcamp. That way I'd be able to freelance during and after college. Also wondering if things like being an RA later down the road are worth it, or other on campus vs off campus jobs.

Scholarships: Have any of you had success with private scholarships? I've applied to a bunch as a senior, and I know its better to seek out niches, but I don't have high hopes for most. Any types of scholarships that I should look out for in college? I don't have any hooks besides that I have traveled a lot, and started a couple of small business ventures.

Federal Pell Grant eligibility: I know they reevaluate every year. I wasn't offered anything this year, but I know about 5% of awards went out to families with incomes of &gt;$50k. Anything I can do here to maximize eligibility for next year?  

Transferring: UCONN was my last choice so I'm still holding on to the possibility that I transfer to a top 25 school. I imagine if this option works out it wouldn't happen until after sophomore year. Does anybody have experience with financial aid after transferring? My family is in the less than $75k income bracket, so ideally we're talking Penn, Duke, Dartmouth. Others, depending a lot more on aid, could be Georgetown, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, Boston College. I'm not currently considering community college as a long term option unless something disastrous financially happens.


2 = Coping with debt after college. Scenarios range from, if I take out $100k I'd be paying ~$1,100/month for 10 years and I'd pay back $140k, to the hopeful of, if I take out closer to $50k I'd be paying ~$550/month for 10 years and pay back $70k in total. This in mind, a few things I've considered doing after my undergrad; 

MBA/Graduate degree: I definitely have a future MBA in mind. I've heard some companies sponsor MBA's in exchange for several years with the company. Is this an uncommon type of offer? How long have some of you had to wait because of debt before doing graduate work?

Starting a business: I'm an entrepreneur at heart, so I know I'll have plenty of ideas/motivation/potential partners/ramen-noodle-budgeting experience, coming out of college. Bootstrapping would probably be key here, but I'd love to hear any stories if you guys have had experience with starting a business while under student loan debt pressure.

And in general, I am wondering of other significant ways debt will affect me after college? I see myself renting in big cities rather than buying until after graduate school + stable career. I also don't see myself marrying young or starting a family at least not before I'm 30 (but who knows). If the finances don't look good the first 5-10 years out of college, I understand that means practicing frugality, and I'll get a taste of that in college. 


Anyways, thanks for reading this far! Feel free to comment on whatever you'd like. Any advice and especially experience related to student loan debt will be appreciated. :)",finance,1430887678

personalfinance,Paying down undergrad loans faster vs. Saving for Grad School - best long term plan?,"Hey Everyone! So i'm new to r/pf and I havent found anyone asking a question like mine. I'm moving cross country to attend the most affordable grad school program I got into and I'm trying to plan what is the best long term solution to school debt. NOTE: I have NO other debt other than student loans. I've been out of school for 2 years and have already paid off 15k using the snowball method. 

**IN:**

- currently make 2300 per month (42k monthly)
- saving 400 a month for grad school expenses
- work a side job with unreliable monthly numbers, but usually about another 100-300 a month
- 8k already in savings, incl. emergency fund

**OUT:**

- paying 700 on current loans (500 per month towards my parents' PLUS loan and about 200 on my own fed stud loans) total is just shy of 90k 
- grad school will cost about 3k after scholarships, high probability of getting an assistantship 2nd yr that will cover all + living expenses
- yearly living expenses budget while in school = 9k high estimate

**Questions:**

1) Does it make sense to pay more than the minimum on the loans I already have or to save the difference to not have to take out more in a new loan? 
    I have the ability to pay off the smallest loan in my name (3k) before I start in august, but I think it may be better to have that in savings to live off of. 

2) My payment on the PLUS loan will need to continue to be paid while the fed loans in my name will freeze over the next two years. Does it make sense to take out the equiv (6k) to pay off the PLUS loan in monthly payments? I know id be taking out a loan to pay a loan, but due to my agreement with my parents it may be the best option for my mental sanity. I don't want the stress of coming up short on that debt. 

3) The goal is to work while in grad school. My current company has not decided if they will keep me on part time (telework) or not, but I will get a side job at school to make sure I still have some income while in school. Would it be smarter to use that income to pay my frozen loans/new loans or to save that to cushion for the next year? I can't imagine I'll make more than 12 bucks an hr so it wont be lifechanging but it would help with incidentals, etc.

Banking,The 5 safest countries to bank offshore,"5. Canada
For Americans, Canada might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think “offshore banking”, but it does have some of the world’s safest banks. Unfortunately, those banks are often off-limits to Americans, especially the ones that pay more aggressive interest rates. While banks like TD Bank have made aggressive pushes into the US market and have been forced to spend an estimated $100 million complying with FATCA, smaller Canadian banks have shut their doors to toxic American clients.
It’s a shame, because as much as I’m sure Canada would roll over for the US government on a whim, they do have some of the safest banks, including aforementioned TD Bank (#11). Other contenders include Royal Bank of Canada, or RBC (#16), Bank of Nova Scotia (#21), the Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and others.

4. Australia
Some have gone so far as to call Australia the “Switzerland of the South Pacific”. I’m not sure I’d go that far, but I will say that many Asians – especially wealthy Chinese – are moving their money to Australia as well as Singapore. The fact that some of that much is “hot” is a potential concern, but Australia’s banks do stack up well when it comes to offshore bank safety.
In fact, Australia controls four positions in a row on the “50 Safest Banks” survey, including National Australia Bank (#16), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (#17), Westpac (#18), and ANZ (#19). ANZ has made an aggressive push into many Asian countries, opening branches everywhere from Vietnam to Cambodia and beyond. Opening a bank account in Australia is possible, but banks there do think a bit like US banks, in many cases assuming only a resident would open account there. If you call one of them, don’t be surprised if they ask when you’re moving to Australia.

3. Netherlands
The good news for the Netherlands is that it is one of the safest countries in which to bank. For us, its membership in the European Union is a bit troubling, particularly after what happened to Cyprus. However, on paper, Netherlands bank accounts are protected by bank deposit insurance for up to 100,000 euros, the EU minimum.

2. Singapore
Undeniably our favorite place to bank here at Nomad Capitalist, Singapore is home to some of the world’s best offshore banks. The tiny Asian financial center is home to three of the world’s safest banks, according to Global Finance: DBS (#12), OCBC (#13), and UOB (#14). By a separate account, OCBC is the “world’s strongest bank”. Singapore has built the best offshore banking center in the world by acknowledging one simple truth: capital goes where it’s treated best.
The fact that Singapore is the richest country in the world by virtue of this understanding is what makes it, in our opinion, a great place to bank. It is getting harder to open an offshore account in Singapore, but it’s still possible. The fact that so many wealthy Asians are ignoring Switzerland in favor of Singapore is an excellent sign that it’s the place to bank.
Germany has the world's safest offshore bank
Americans may be surprised to learn they can open offshore accounts in Germany (albeit at low interest rates), which has the world’s safest bank according to Global Finance magazine

1. Germany
Germany is home to KfW, the number one safest bank in the world according to Global Finance. In all, Germany is home to six of the world’s fifty safest banks, including Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank (#4), L-Bank (#5), NRW Bank (#8), and more. As one of Europe’s stronger economies, Germans take their banking system seriously. And while bank secrecy in Germany isn’t what it is in other German-speaking countries like Austria or even Switzerland, Germans are concerned about things like capital controls.
It was the Germans that convinced the European Union to issue a high-value 500 euro bank note so they could more easily keep hard currency at home. Now that much of Europe is bankrupt, it seems German banks are more attractive. A few German banks accept foreigners, including Americans, but the accounts offered are typically general retail accounts with little option for currency diversification and low, low interest rates.
Amazingly, US banks showed an improvement in the most recent “Best Banks” survey, with two retail banks making the list at #31 and #41. That’s up from the previous survey in which not a single US retail bank made the list. Don’t get too excited, though; the two Chinese banks that made the list both beat out all US contenders.

The American financial aid system is quite different then the Canadian one so I was hoping Reddit could help me out with some unique ways to help finance the next 4 years of my education! Obviously the exchange rate is quite detrimental to my situation right now so I was hoping to get some information on the following items

* How can I take out my student loans in USD to avoid converting to CAD for a couple years.

* Is there any U.S. Federal student aid for Canadian students?

* Are here any good scholarship/bursary resources for Canadian students?

Estimated tuition and living expenses are $60,000 per year for 4 years so I'm looking to finance approximately $240,000. 

The program does not offer any months off to work in between semesters and with 10 classes per semester, working evenings and weekends for extra income won't be an option. 

I currently have $20,000 available to me through an existing $40,000 student line of credit which I used to finance my undergrad at 4.5%. This line of credit can be extended up to $80,000 for grad schools. 

Canadian OSAP funding should provide approximately $10,000 per year. 

The Royal Bank of Canada offers a line of creek for $120,000 for grad school students. 

Overall, if my parents get approved as co-signers I'll have roughly $220,000 CAD available to me which won't be enough for the full 4 years.

My question is, is the prospect of being loan free within 3 years worth not building up my savings?

Thanks!

**Scheduled Monthly Payment $198.53**

Each loan accrues interest at its own individual interest rate. 

The calculation used to determine the amount of interest that accrues per day is as follows:

* Total Unpaid Principal Balance * Interest Rate / 365 (Days in a Year)
* Based on the above calculation, my current per diem is $2.96. This will fluctuate when my outstanding principal balance and/or interest rate changes.
* **Interest per Month is approximately $90.00 per month.** 


* 102 payments left
* APR cannot be provided since my interest accrues daily. 


In short I’m paying $200 a month and $90 is going to interest alone. That is practically half! I see companies offering interest rates close to same (3%-6% APR) when you refinance your student debt with them. I am not sure of how to compare my interest now which accrues daily to annual interest rate. 


Wouldn't it help to refinance because it would be one large loan accruing interest instead of each individual loan?

personalfinance,Reducing the interest on my student loans.,"I live in the US and I have been paying off student loans for a few years now. I don't have as much debt as many people I know and I am grateful for that, I am at about 7,000 right now. I don't make a lot of money but I pay what I can on the 16 of every month. ranging from 100 to 200 dollars. But my interest rate is killing me. I hate seeing a good chunk of what I'm paying doing nothing! What is the best course of action for this? Can I move it to a different lender that doesn't start charging interest for a while? 
I know I can pay the payment more often and the interest rate goes down. My first paycheck of the month pretty much all goes to my rent and the rest of my bills are paid on the second pay check. I guess what I'm asking is: would it be better to save money from my second paycheck so that I can pay some on the 16 and some on the 1? Or would it be better to move the loan to another lender? (If that is possible) Or is there another alternative I don't know about?

personalfinance,Student loans--what to consider aside from the interest rate?,"I'm starting a graduate program this Fall and need advice on loans. My parents paid for my undergrad outright so I'm new to the student loans world.

My options:

Federal unsubsidized loan at 5.41%
I could either pay quarterly interest or just capitalize after it goes into repayment

SallieMae Smart Option loan with the following choices:

Variable Interest Rate:
a) Interest payment, interest rate at 4.25%, $70.83 in-school payment with higher post-school payments, lowest total cost and repayment term
b) Fixed payment at 4.5%, $25 in school payment, medium post-school payment
c) Deferred Payment at 4.75% with 0 in school, lowest post-school with highest total cost

Fixed interest rate:
d) interest payment at 6.75% at $112.5 in school, highest post-school, lowest total cost and repayment term
e) fixed payment, 7%, $25 in school, medium post-school
f) deferred payment at 7.25%, $0 in school, lowest post school, highest total cost and repayment term



So. If I'm understanding this correctly, the Variable Interest Rate with Interest Payment is the best option, with the lowest interest rate, but the highest post-school payment, correct? I've only heard nasty things about SallieMae, but it seems like getting the lower interest rate is better than going with the Federal unsubsidized, correct?

Long story short, I screwed myself over at a car dealership which was largely my fault. Information that was relayed to me verbally wasn't at all what I had signed for. Entirely my fault, rookie mistake and I've learned from it.

personalfinance,Unpaid training - how do I make it through?,"Hi all. First off, let me say that I SUCK with money. Made some big mistakes, huge mistakes, that I'm currently cleaning up.

Some background: My parents never set aside a dime for post secondary education for me and ""made too much money"" for me to qualify for government student loans. Got a loan from a bank. I lived off that loan and went to school off that loan for 3 years, $40,000k in debt. Graduated with a useless arts degree, no job in sight. Went to school a second time, lived off credit cards for a year. Graduated, could only find part time or casual work. Debt piled high, too high to manage. Couldn't pay anything, went to collections, etc. Fast forward a few years. I now have a job that pays 49,000k a year. I still have $28,000k in loan debt. Credit cards are paid off. Was working out of town and my POS car croaked. Because of my credit, no bank would give me a loan to buy a used vehicle. Had to finance a car at a ridiculously inflated interest rate, 12% over 8 years. Bought brand new because I needed a reliable car for all the work travel.

Currently I make BARELY enough to cover monthly bills and payments. Very little leftover after, none actually. No savings. 

I have been accepted to training for corrections. Good job, good pay. However, training is 10 weeks unpaid. It will be AT LEAST 12 weeks before I see a paycheque.

How in the world can I swing this??? Seems like shooting myself in the foot to turn down a good paying job that will help me pay down my debt because I can't afford the unpaid training. What can I do?? I am losing so much sleep over this. I've picked up 2 part time jobs on top of working full time but it still won't be nearly enough to support myself by the time training starts. I'm exhausted and stressed. Please help if you have any advice :( Thanks so much!",finance,1430937499
personalfinance,Feedback on my financial plan?,"Alright, here goes: 

About me: early 30s, just finished my graduate degree and about to begin my first salaried job (August). After years of living as a poor grad student, I want to have a good financial plan in place once I start getting a real pay check. I'm married, share finances w/ my partner, and live in the US. I'd love to hear feedback on my goals and plan. This is a very ""back of the envelop"" plan, so I'm mainly looking for feedback on my prioritization and thinking, less so the numbers themselves. 

**Goals:** 

* Save 25-30K for a house downpayment (currently have 7K set aside)

* Save 10K emergency fund (currently have 2.5K)

* Begin retirement savings


**Current finances:** 

Income

* Parter's salary: $58K (may get a raise, but that's uncertain)

* My salary: $50-52K

* Other income: ~$1-2K/ year from occasional freelancing

Debt

* No CC debt carried month to month

* $14K left on car loan @2.4% interest

* $28K in federal student loans @ 3% interest

* $6K in private student loans @ ~7% interest


Savings/Investment

* $7K in short-term bond

* $2.5K in savings account

* ~$10K in partner's 401 (currently contributing max matching amount)

* ~$500 in my 401 from a part-time job

Expenses

* Approx. 2,800/month


**Plan**

Right now, we aren't making much more than what we need to cover our expenses, so saving has been slow. We also had a medical emergency a few months ago that wiped out a lot of what we had saved. Once I start getting paid in August, I'm estimating we'll have about $3K/month left over to start using to achieve our goals. 


* First, I think we should prioritize building our emergency fund back up by putting $1K/month for 6 months, then $500/mo after until we reach $10K. That'd take ~9 months total.

* Second, since we want to buy a house in the relatively near future, add $1K/mo to the house fund for 6 months, then $1.5K/mo afterwards. At that rate, since we already have $7K saved, it'd take ~15 months to hit $25K.

* Third, since my private loan is only 6K but has 7% interest, I'd like to pay that down more aggressively by putting $300/mo toward it. That'd take about 20 months to pay off at that rate.

* With the remaining money, I'd like to open Roth IRAs and begin contributing to them. Once we hit our emergency fund and downpayment goals, then ramp up contributions to the maximum allowed amount.

How does this sound as a rough plan? What haven't I thought of? Thanks!",finance,1430937591
personalfinance,Should I take out extra money out for a mortgage just to dump it back in?,"We are buying a new coop apartment in NYC.  We have almost paid off our current apartment.  The price difference and paying off our current mortgage will probably be about 80k.  I am thinking about taking out a 200k loan instead.  
I'm planning on just making 120k principal payment right after we close.  I was planning on taking out the extra money for 2 reasons.  First the interest rate for such a low loan is slightly higher.  Second, I was interested in doing a reverse points situation.  We are only looking to stay in this apartment for a few years probably.  There are about 10-15k associated expenses that we won't get back when we sell.  So if we can do -.5 point and get back $1000 toward those expenses it seems like it makes sense.  Yes, we will pay a higher rate but dumping back 2/3 of the money back into the mortgage immediately we will be towards the end of a 15 year year mortgage so we won't be paying too much interest anyways.

Lately I've been doing really well and have sold quite a few homes back to back and I've finally found myself with more money than I've ever had (I say that with some embarrassment lol) I've used some of the money I earned already to make some larger payments on my CC and paid off my Amex, since that one is about to run out of its interest free time, I also paid off a TV that was coming up on its two year free no interest. The reason I prioritized those is because the interest rates were over 17% once the promotion expired. I guess I could have taken advantage of it for another couple weeks..

I currently have about $9,000.00 after all the payments I made.

I owe $5,800.00 in credit card debt. This is on one card at 7.99%

This particular investor purchases a 50% share in a 106k home. She takes 18k out of mutual funds for closing costs and a significant down payment to avoid pmi. She co-owns the home for 2.5 years and puts an additional 13k into improvements over this time. While living in the house, she pays 200/mo less than she would pay for a comparable rental and saves a measly $200/year on taxes. At the end of the 2.5 years, sells the house at $165k with three towards closing and no realtors fees, walking away with $42k.
However, during the same time, the stock market performed exceptionally, gaining 29% in 2013, 11% in 2014, and let's say she owns the house for half of 2015 where it's earning approximately 9% per year.

personalfinance,Strategies On How To Reduce Your Debt,"Have you ever heard the saying; you get what you focus on? It is just a law of the universe, don’t believe me; think about those times when you've hurt your toe or foot or hand or elbow, do you then tend to focus on it and try to be careful not to bump it? But despite all of your best efforts to protect it you then seem to hit everything in sight, drop anything on it, fall over or basically, knock or run into everything you possibly can! Or maybe you are focusing on being really quiet not to wake up your sleeping partner or child, but then seem to bang and crash about by being clumsy! Maybe that is just me. I believe it is a rule you just can’t escape.

Well guess what, this works in the debt world as well. If you focus on your debt, you will tend to get more of it.

What if instead of focusing on eliminating debt exclusively, why not focus on increasing your income first to then eliminate your debt far more rapidly than you ever thought possible? Perhaps this is a new way of thinking about it altogether.

Now I'm not saying forget about your debt all together, I’m suggesting stabilise your debt and meet your minimum repayments and then focus your efforts on creating another income source or accelerating your cash flow so you can pay down your debt far more rapidly. This is simply the difference between a proactive versus a passive approach to debt reduction.

What is the current state of affairs?

Most Australian’s are up to their eyeballs in debt and in reality are 2-3 years away from becoming debt free on things such as credit card debt, store cards and personal loans. This is simply because they exclusively rely on trying to save extra money from an already tight budget and fighting with rising costs of living and then try to pay down debt with what is left over, which usually is none, this can take forever and lets face it is slow, frustrating.

So how does my strategy work?

What if instead of saving to pay down debt, you could instead create an additional income stream over say a 6-12 month period, which you could then re-direct exclusively towards your debt, and then use this in addition to the extra weekly, fortnightly or monthly savings you can distribute there also? If you had more disposable income, would that then allow you to eliminate debt far more rapidly? You better believe it.

Guess what the real kicker is? After your debt is eliminated, you still have an additional income stream, which you can use to invest in assets towards your financial freedom or just bump up your lifestyle a bit with more holidays or some of those guilt free purchases without debt or even pay down your own home.

One of the strategies I teach to my personal coaching clients creates 2-3% returns on your investment per month, yes you heard me per month, so if you invested $10,000 you will see a return of $200-$300 return every single month or perhaps $30,000 and earn $500-$600 per month extra income. Even better, it is conservative, simple and time efficient; almost sounds too good to be true doesn't it? I thought the same until I started using it.

Some of you will be thinking, “That sounds great…. but first, where do I get the money? And secondly, if this is so good why haven’t I heard of this before?”

Although most Australian’s do have record high debt levels, many also have massively untapped resources lying around them at any point in time that can be used astutely to reduce debt rapidly.

Although most Australian’s do have record high debt levels, many also have massively untapped resources lying around them at any point in time that can be used astutely to reduce debt rapidly. This could be equity in a personal home or investment property; it could be in those shares you bought 10 years ago, which are now just sitting in your bottom draw doing not very much; or perhaps it is simply cash you have sitting in the bank because you don’t know what else to do with it.

One of the core activities you need to do a couple of times a year is to do a stock take of where you are financially and see what assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses you have coming in on a yearly, monthly and weekly basis. You can then use this time to uncover what assets are not performing up to scratch for you or in short are being lazy…….or if you’re not sure where to start, then it’s time to get a coach to help you and make a proactive decision to get out of your debt spiral

I did this exercise with one of my clients recently; what we uncovered were large cash deposits simply sitting in a bank account earning only 3% per annum, untapped equity in their own home, and an ill performing super fund and they were struggling to keep up with personal debt and couldn't seem to get ahead even though they were earning an above average income.

We spent the next 6 weeks, creating an investment strategy and debt reduction plan and beginning to get all of their
lazy money working efficiently and effectively for them. Instead of earning only 3% per year in a bank, it is now on the way to creating 2-3% per month in a conservative strategy using blue-chip shares, and with a step by step plan to pay down their bad debt to zero within the next 6 months.

Without this intervention, this couple was on the road to spending the next 3-5 years desperately trying to pay down debt by simply saving.

Lets look at how this can work in real life.

Imagine if you had $20k personal credit card debt at an interest rate of 18%. After setting a budget you have found and committed $200 per week or $800 per month to begin paying down your level of debt.

So when you have a credit card we have two things we need to focus on: –

1. Our ongoing interest repayment, often this will be about 18% per annum. So from a $20K credit card debt this is going to be $300 per month of interest, so we know we have to pay this every single month and this does not decrease your credit card debt, just keeps you from getting further into trouble.

2. The second part is actually paying down the principal amount, so out of the $800 per month, $300 needs to be committed to paying the interest and we can use the other $500 per month to begin getting rid of our debt once and for all.
If you were just using that $800 per month to meet your interest repayments and pay down your principal, you are looking at 2 years and 9 months to completely eliminate your debt and start again at ground zero, this is of course taking into account you make no additional purchases with it (which for most people is highly unlikely, just look at Harvey Norman’s on the weekend to see the proof!)

Now what if instead of just focusing on paying down debt, we instead focused on creating another income stream using the same $800 a month we’ve spared.

It is still important to pay your $300 per week interest amount, which you have to pay, but instead of adding those extra $500 per month to pay down your credit cards $20K principal amount, you used the extra money to create an extra level of income for you, which can earn for you 3% per month.

What is the result?

Rather than taking 2 years and 9 months to pay down your credit card debt you can pay it off 5 months earlier! Saving you $4,000!

Or what if you decided to keep creating this income for the next 5 months and then pay off your credit card? So you will still completely pay off your credit card in 2 years and 9 months, but on top of that you will come out with an additional $5,753.78 in cash! I can show you how to do this!

Lets look at the next step

Now imagine if you paid off your credit card and continued to commit the same contributions your were making to your credit card of $800 per month to continue building a second income for yourself, what would be the result?

After 2 years

You would be earning an extra $279 per week in additional income or $14,553 per year in almost passive income and also have $37,317 in cash savings.

After 4 years

This is now 4 years after you’ve paid off your $20K credit card using the same savings plan as you started with. You are now earning $775.51 per week or $40,326 per annum and have $103,400 in savings and could comfortably drop back to part time work for most.

After 6 years

You have now replaced the average Australian’s income of $62,000 per year and have $158,000 in savings! Imagine that….$20K in credit card debt to $62,000 per annum in almost passive income and $158,000 in savings.

What is even better, this strategy is conservative, easy to learn and only takes 2 hours per month to implement. We can all create 2 hours per month in our life to implement this, especially if we can use it to pay down our debt to zero, pay off your home faster than you ever thought possible or replace an income.

So many people get overwhelmed and caught up in debt; they focus on it and spend all their time stressing and worrying over it. Why not try change your thinking, look outside the box and focus on creating something positive in a new income rather than simply working so hard to pay down debt. At the same time, you will be empowering yourself to create an additional income stream not just for now, but also potentially for the rest of your life.

All this by simply changing what you focus on and working alongside someone who can coach or mentor you and guide you to proactively make the most of your money, increase your income and step out of your debt spiral!",finance,1430973210

Global sovereign bond market seeing massive selloffs as investors rush for exit from crowded one sided trade. Though this recent rout tends to be global phenomenon, European bonds are experiencing most of the brunt amid heavy price swings.

* German Bund, which stands as European monetary union's benchmark debt, has surged to 0.61% as of now from its historic low of 0.05% on April 17th.

* German yield curve that moved to negative territory, up to 9 years is now negative only up to 4 years.

* German 30 year rose from 0.41% on April 17th to 1.195% as of today. This is close to 78 basis points rise in just a matter of two weeks.

Legendary bond investor Mr. Bill Gross has warned against one way move to bring rates close to negative territory and thought of it as historic opportunity to short 10 year bund. However market moved even before he could take position according to his say, resulting in loss in his long bund positions.

This column has been warning against one way ride in sovereign bond market and lending to government at near zero rates.

However we did not consider bund as historic opportunity to go short, we preferred French counterpart and still maintain the stance and believe that lending to government even at this rate doesn't make sense and believe that central bank's monetary policy might get to successful in bringing back inflation.

The price rout came with higher volatility and price swings, posing additional problems for market participants.

* The chart from Bloomberg shows that implied volatility has reached 8.16% from just 3.3% in mid -April. Volatility has reached highest level since 2012.

Inflation expectation and rising fuel price might be contributing to latest rout in bond market, we believe lack of liquidity in the market and rush to exit is responsible for such price swings.

Reaction from ECB, over this latest rout would be vital to watch out, however ECB might shrug off any fear and taper talks as 10 year bund yield at 0.61% is still very low.

However according to her overall risks to financial stability remains stable and contained.

Ms. Yellen has also warned against sharp bond market movement especially on the longer end of the curve, when Federal Reserve would start hiking rates.

Bond market impact -

* Fed rate hike might give rise to term premium which might shoot up rapidly posing significant risks to investors shorting longer dated bond. Moreover recent rise in global bond yields indicate that investors are growing anxious over holding longer dated government securities as they fear of inflation in coming time.

Stock market impact -

* Equity market is long due a major correction so any significant sell off does not mean that good old bullish days are over for equities as return of global growth would be price supportive of equities.

 
* Clear 10-20% correction in the index might be sweet spot to buy.

personalfinance,Mortgages and the consequences of rising interest rates and decreasing real estate value. I think it's important to be aware of the possible implications.,"I am considering to buy (in Germany) and talked to my friend to get some advice. He told me that I should consider two points when deciding to get a mortgage:

**1. Rising Interest Rates**

This is obvious for everybody and all you guys probably know this. When you take out a mortgage you not only have to calculate if you are able to shoulder the monthly payments now, but you also have to calculate if you will be able to if interest rates rise to a certain level as soon as your interest rate changes. In Germany interest rates are normally fixed for 10 years. After that the interest rate WILL change according to the level they are at then. So you will have to try and anticipate a worst case scenario and find out if you can still pay your mortgage. Again, this is basic stuff and if you do not take this into consideration yet, you really should.

**2. If house prices drop**

Even though people on this sub might be mindful about point 1, a lot of people in the real world are not. They are (and have been) taking out mortgages for the past years because interest rates are so low. And that is fair enough. However as soon as interest rates will go up (and they will at some point) many of those people might not be able to afford their mortgage anymore and will be forced to sell. Personally I think that many people take out mortgages that are on the limit of what they can afford (because they want the nicest house they can get). As a consequence many people will be forced to sell when interest rates go up. This might lead to a decrease in real estate values because the market will be flooded with property. See Detroit. This will then mean that your security with the bank (your house) loses value and the bank will increase the mortgage repayments because of the increased risk. This might then lead to further house sales and boom! Bubble!

**My message is:** When you take out a mortgage, take the above two points into consideration and make sure that if either happens you will still be able to pay the bank otherwise you will lose your home. I am not saying don't take out a mortgage. Just make sure you consider possible future scenarios.",finance,1430987700

investing,Effects of Various Economic Conditions on the Markets,"When I asked Pauline about writing a second guest post here, she suggested I talk about factors that will affect the average investor’s retirement nest egg. So in this post, I’ll be discussing the various economic and historical conditions that will affect investors in the medium tern (1-5 years) and long term future (5 to 10 years out), and how you can prepare yourself when each of these conditions hit.

Inflation
Without going into the arcane and pointless details, I’ll explain QE (quantitative easing) in good ole’ plain English. QE is the Federal Reserve’s way of printing money, thereby injecting more and more liquidity (money) into the financial system. Bernake (Fed Chairman) believes that this will pull the American economy out of the muck for good, and right now, whether this is working or not is still questionable.

HOWEVER, quantitative easing does have a problem – the printing of money theoretically speaking should cause inflation. But since QE first began, inflation has been virtually non-existent. How come?

According to theory, printing money causes inflation. BUT, what the economy has been experiencing post-recession is a deflationary environment. The economy isn’t doing too well, and prices should be declining. But with the Fed’s printing of money, the deflation is negated, resulting in zero inflation.

However, sooner or later (probably sooner, along the lines of 1 – 2 years) inflation is going to (finally) pick up. Why? Think of it this way. Deflation has always existed, and the Fed’s printing of money has been negating this deflation. However, soon that negation will be over (when the inflation is sufficient enough to totally negate the deflation), and the printing of money will finally cause real inflation.

So what do you do when inflation hits? Historically speaking, investors think that inflation is bad for stocks. That’s a huge misconception. This misconception only exists because stocks went flat in the 1970s when inflation was huge. HOWEVER, the 1970s were an anomaly – we experienced stagflation, when inflation was coupled with a sagging economy. In most cases, inflation occurs in a growing economy (or in today’s case, a nominally growing GDP). I believe that this time around, the recovery is real and that we’re not going to experience stagflation.

Hence, I think that buying stocks would be great when inflation hits. When inflation comes around, currencies get devalued and nominally speaking stock prices rise, leading to greater returns for equity investors.

Devaluation
Devaluation is closely linked to inflation – when governments print money, the real value of their currencies becomes devalued. Whenever currencies get devalued, all hard assets such as stocks and commodities shoot up in price. Speaking of commodities…

The Once in a Lifetime Opportunity
People believe that precious metals are a hedge against an economic downturn. Again, that’s a misconception. When the 2008 recession hit, precious metals (gold and silver) actually fell the hardest. This misconception originates (again) from the 1970s when a crappy economy was coupled with soaring gold and silver prices.

Precious metals rose in the 1970s not because of the poor economy but because of inflation. The 1970s were a rare case of stagflation, something that doesn’t fit in with today. Currently, the economy is humming along, but inflation will be a big issue. Thus, when inflation starts to creep up it will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for medium term investors who are willing to hold onto their gold and silver positions for at least a year.

The Fight for Resources
There’s a prime fundamental reason (besides inflation) that supports the rise in commodity prices (especially gold and silver). It’s simple. We have fewer and fewer resources to feed a larger and larger population. When Thomas Malthus first predicted that the world would end (this was back in 1798), he forgot to factor in technology. Technological improvements can increase the efficiency at which we extract our resources. HOWEVER, even technology has a limit. The efficiency is ultimately limited to the amount of resources we have. Currently, the world is reaching a turning point. If all the emerging market nations start to consume at the rate Americans do, the world’s resources would be gone sooner rather than later. When the demand for raw materials goes up and the supply goes down, prices will soar.

Historical Charts
You’ve all heard it – historically, the U.S. stock market has yielded (on average) 7.5% returns. That’s actually a really clever lie concocted by brokers and financial groups to get you to purchase equities.

The “average of 7.5%” is from the post-War period. If you look at a different time frame, such as if you were to include the Great Depression, the “average rate of return” is a lot less. That’s what the financial industry does – repackaging facts to make them look better than when they first came in.

The post-war period is actually an anomaly, a period of unprecedented economic growth that is unlikely to be repeated again in the near future. This growth was caused by major technological revolutions, from household appliances to computers to the internet and high speed communications. Today? Come on guys – the market is going to grow at 7.5% with a bunch of undergrads making $0.99 iPhone apps.

My point is, if the stock market is going to pick up its pace in the long run, it needs to be supported by major technological leaps. Unfortunately, since the dawn of the internet our society’s brightest have been attracted towards the fast money of internet riches, drawn away from solid industries that actually contribute to mankind’s life (think of space mining, green energy – the capital intensive industries). Thus, without any major technological revolutions happening right now how can we expect economic and market growth to pick up? We can’t. There’s no driver for the growth engine.

The Summary
To sum it all up, I’m going to divide things into two time frames. The medium time frame is the 1-5 year outlook, whereas the long term outlook is 5-20 years.

For the medium outlook, things are looking decidedly positive. Once inflation picks up (which is inevitable with all the money printing), stocks and commodities are going to soar, particularly gold and silver whose bull markets aren’t over.

However, the long term is less positive. Sure, the stock market will still experience long term bull markets. But I don’t think the average rate of return will be 7.5% anymore, unless we experience another major technological breakthrough. The problem is that these breakthroughs are the results of years and years of work, something that hasn’t happened thanks to all our smartest engineers being attracted to industries that do not really contribute that much to mankind. (I like Facebook as much as the next guy in line, but hey, it hasn’t had as much an impact on my life as the advent of the computer has.)",finance,1430988890
finance,Question about discount rates in DCF theory,"It is a popular statement among the financial community that at normal interest rates, cash flows beyond 15 years are valueless because their incremental present value is zero or negative.

To be clear, this is not meant to be a perfectly applicable real-life question. It's meant to discover a flaw in the theoretical principal and its assumptions. Why do we completely discount $1 invested in a stock 15 years ago, when clearly it can be shown to be worth at least $1.000000000001 (by virtue of existing in retained earnings if not distributed)?

Therefor the best time to buy would be when interest rates are high, but expected to fall (if one was able to predict this).
However, i'm not sure whether this applies to bond ETF's, because as far as i am aware, many Bond ETF's hold the bonds until maturity. Does this mean the best time to buy a bond ETF is when rates are low (and thus not many people are interested in bonds) because the stock price of the ETF would also be low as a result of lower demand?

If bond rates are low now, would a Bond ETF be a good place to store money, if an investor was concerned about the potential of a significant correction?",finance,1431003521

personalfinance,"My car just broke, and I need advice quick!","Long-time lurker, just found myself with an emergency.

Back story: was really stupid about money when I was younger, and am trying to dig out of my special hole. Probably currently making bad decisions as well, which I'm sure I'm about to learn.

I have a 2004 Toyota matrix, 118,000 miles. When I bought it in '09, I got a terrible interest rate, didn't take that to my bank to get a lower-rate loan. Then I fell on lean times and FINALLY refinanced, and so now I still owe about $3400. I'm in school full-time, so living on student loans. I just got my disbursement for this semester, so I have $10,800 in the bank today. I will need $3500 for living expenses until next semester. I was planning to use the extra $7300 to pay down my old high-interest credit cards. (About $8300 total now.) I don't have housing or food costs. My only debt is the credit cards and my car, and of course student loans which are currently deferred.

So right now, I'm sitting in my broken car on the side of the interstate. I think the problem might just be the clutch. I just put $1100 into the car for new tires and brakes, and I don't know how much more I should put into it before just getting a newer car. I was really hoping to make this one last until I graduate school, in Dec 2016. Should I look into a lease situation? Will I even be able to consider buying another car since I don't have a job?

personalfinance,How to use my travel account?,"My fiance and I are about to get married, and have been saving up for our honeymoon.  We share a checking account at a credit union that is set up with both of our direct deposits from work, and have a savings account that we put our surplus into (and as much savings as we can.)  A few months ago, I realized that a different type of savings account was better for interest rates and switched to using that for our typical savings purposes, but did not close the old account.

Instead of closing it, I kept it open as our ""Travel account.""  We've been putting a bit of money into it for our honeymoon, and have saved about as much as we're going to need.  Even after our honeymoon, we both want to travel, so I imagine we can do the same thing--keep saving money into it until we hit our budget goal and can go on a trip.  My question is, how do you recommend making use of this account for our trips?  Our cards are currently set to withdraw automatically from our checking account.  Is there a way to temporarily switch them to draw from this savings account instead?  I suppose we could always move the balance over into our checking account before we leave, draw as normal, then look at how much we've spent later and put the difference back into the travel account, but that seems like a hassle.

Does anyone else have any experience/advice on how to handle this?",finance,1431005315

personalfinance,(Europe) How should I organize my money for this trip?,"I'll be going to Australia in September for an unpaid internship until mid-January with a couple of others, I need to save up some money etc. 
but I don't now how I should organize this trip.

So far I've €600 in savings. 

Income until my internship begins:

+ €100,- p/m (for being a student)

+ €80,- p/m (allowance)

+ €150,- p/m (part-time job)

-  €25,- p/m (phone bill)

That's a steady income of €305,- p/m. 
I'll also receive 15K that my dad saved up, however I don't want to spend that
money if possible. So what I try to do is save some money, currently I'm saving €100-€150 a month.
With four months left I can save approximitely another €500,- 


Tickets + the visum and some other things are going to cost me €2000,- before I even 
start my unpaid internship. 


My expected expenses are €950 p/m while I'm there. 


While I'm there my income would change as well.

+ €280,- p/m (for being a student living out)

+ €80,- p/m (allowance)

+ €100,- p/m (for not using public transport)

- €25,- p/m (phone bill)

That's a steady income of €435,-
That leaves a gap of €950 - €435 = €515

So I still need to finance that somehow, 
I could either use the money from the 15K savings or get a loan. 
Because I'm a student I can get very cheap loans. 

Interest rate on savings 1.35%
Interest rate student loans 0.35%

So I thought the best thing to do is to take a loan of 600 per month,
and cover the intrest costs with the interest received from the savings.
Is this a good thing to do? Or doesn't it work like this? 
Besides this loan I would not have any other unpaid loans. So my 
total loans would be €2400,- after my study. 


However I also want to go on a trip with friends to eastern Europe before I leave, 
this would cost me €500,- How should I finance this? I thought using the money I save from now on, and 
get a loan to finance the flight ticket, or is there a better way to do this?

As I said above - I have $5400 outstanding on my car loan, and $6700 in my emergency fund. My original plan that I got from the link above - was to keep $4000 for my emergency fund and shovel the rest directly into the car loan. 

I am getting antsy seeing that I have enough in my account to pay off my car loan 100%,  I'm thinking most of you would say stick to the plan, but what are your opinions?  I'd really like to have that one more debt gone. The interest rate is 7.24%. Once that is paid off, the only debt I have left is my student loan which I will be tackling next.

Keep in mind that I have absolutely no savings. All the extra money I have is that $6700. Of course I have money left over each month after I get paid and pay all my bills, but that usually all goes into my highest interest loan at the time. My plan is to start saving a certain percentage of extra money each month once my car loan is paid off - then the rest will go into my student loan, which is about 5.3% floating. I think it's prime plus 1 or 2 or something.

investing,Mind The $76 Trillion Global Bond Bubble Even The Experts Are Getting Scared,"Warren Buffett believes “that bonds are very overvalued“, and a recent survey of fund managers found that 80 percent of them are convinced that bonds have become “badly overvalued“.  The most famous bond expert on the planet, Bill Gross, recently confessed that he has a sense that the 35 year bull market in bonds is “ending” and he admitted that he is feeling “great unrest”.  Nobel Prize–winning economist Robert Shiller has added a new chapter to his bestselling book in which he argues that bond prices are “irrationally high”.  The global bond bubble has ballooned to more than 76 trillion dollars, and interest rates have never been lower in modern history.  In fact, 25 percent of all government bonds in Europe actually have a negative rate of return at this point.  There is literally nowhere for the bond market to go except for the other direction, and when this bull market turns into a bear it will create chaos and financial devastation all over the planet.

In a recent piece entitled “A Sense Of Ending“, bond guru Bill Gross admitted that the 35 year bull market in bonds that has made him and those that have invested with him so wealthy is now coming to an end…

Stanley Druckenmiller, George Soros, Ray Dalio, Jeremy Grantham, among others warn investors that our 35 year investment supercycle may be exhausted. They don’t necessarily counsel heading for the hills, or liquidating assets for cash, but they do speak to low future returns and the increasingly fat tail possibilities of a “bang” at some future date. To them, (and myself) the current bull market is not 35 years old, but twice that in human terms. Surely they and other gurus are looking through their research papers to help predict future financial “obits”, although uncertain of the announcement date. Savor this Bull market moment, they seem to be saying in unison. It will not come again for any of us; unrest lies ahead and low asset returns. Perhaps great unrest, if there is a bubble popping.

And the way that he ended his piece sounds rather ominous…

I wish to still be active in say 2020 to see how this ends. As it is, in 2015, I merely have a sense of an ending, a secular bull market ending with a whimper, not a bang. But if so, like death, only the timing is in doubt. Because of this sense, however, I have unrest, increasingly a great unrest. You should as well.

Bill Gross is someone that knows what he is talking about.  I would consider his words very carefully.

Another renowned financial expert, Yale professor Robert Shiller, warned us about the stock bubble in 2000 and about the real estate bubble in 2005.  Now, he is warning about the danger posed by this bond bubble…

In the first edition of his landmark book “Irrational Exuberance,” published in 2000, the Yale professor of economics and 2013 Nobel Laureate presciently warned that stocks looked especially expensive. In the second edition, published in 2005 shortly before the real estate bubble crashed, he added a chapter about real estate valuations. And in the new edition, due out later this month, Shiller adds a fresh chapter called “The Bond Market in Historical Perspective,” in which he worries that bond prices might be irrationally high.

For years, ultra-low interest rates have enabled governments around the world to go on a debt binge unlike anything the world has ever seen.  Showing very little restraint since the last financial crisis, they have piled up debts that are exceedingly dangerous.  If interest rates were to return to historical norms, it would instantly create the greatest government debt crisis in history.

A recent letter from IceCap Asset Management summarized where we basically stand today…

Considering:

1) governments are unable to eliminate deficits

2) global government debt is increasing exponentially

3) 0% interest rates are allowing governments to borrow more to pay off old loans and fund deficits

4) Global growth is declining despite money printing and bailouts And, we’ve saved the latest and greatest fact for last: as stunning as 0% interest rates sound, the mathematically-challenged-fantasyland called Europe has just one upped everyone by introducing NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES.

As of writing, over 25% of all bonds issued by European governments has a guaranteed negative return for investors.

Germany can borrow money for 5 years at an interest rate of NEGATIVE 0.10%. Yes, instead of Germany paying you interest when you lend them money, you have to pay them interest.

These same negative interest rate conditions exist across many of the Eurozone countries, as well as Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland.

Negative interest rates are by nature irrational.

Why in the world would you pay someone to borrow money from you?

It doesn’t make any sense at all, and this irrational state of affairs will not last for too much longer.

At some point, investors are going to come to the realization that the 35 year bull market for bonds is finished, and then there will be a massive rush for the exits.  This rush for the exits will be unlike anything the bond market has ever seen before.  Robert Wenzel of the Economic Policy Journal says that this coming rush for the exits will set off a “death spiral”…

Anyone who holds the view that the Fed will not soon raise interest rates,and soon, fails to understand the nature of the developing crisis. It will be led by a collapse of the bond market.

Market forces, somewhat misleadingly called bond-vigilantes, will lead the charge.

I am not as bearish in the short-term on the stock market. The equity markets will be volatile because of the climb in rates and look scary at times but the death spiral will be in the bond market.

As this death spiral accelerates, we are going to see global interest rates rise dramatically.  And considering the fact that more than 400 trillion dollars in derivatives are directly tied to interest rates, that is a very scary thing.

And in case you are wondering, the stock market will be deeply affected by all of this as well.  I believe that we are going to witness a stock market crash even greater than what we experienced in 2008, and other experts are projecting similar things.  For example, just consider what Marc Faber recently told CNBC…

“For the last two years, I’ve been thinking that U.S. stocks are due for a correction,” Faber said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “But I always say a bubble is a bubble, and if there’s no correction, the market will go up, and one day it will go down, big time.”

“The market is in a position where it’s not just going to be a 10 percent correction. Maybe it first goes up a bit further, but when it comes, it will be 30 percent or 40 percent minimum!” Faber asserted.

Where we are right now is at the end of the party.  There are some that want to keep on dancing to the music for as long as possible, but most can see that things are winding down and people are starting to head for the exits.

The irrational global financial bubble that investors have been enjoying for the past few years has stretched on far longer than it should have.  But that is the way irrational bubbles work – they just keep going even when everyone can see that they have become absolutely absurd.  However, eventually something always comes along and bursts them, and once that happens markets can crash very, very rapidly.

Banking,Apple Pay Coming Soon to You: New Banks &amp; Credit Unions Implement Mobile Payment Service for MasterCard Cardholders,"Making its way across the country, more than 20 new banks and credit unions are now live with Apple Pay giving MasterCard cardholders from California to Florida the opportunity to leverage this simple and secure mobile payment option. Apple Pay continues its rapid growth, delivering payment choice to an increasing number of consumers.


MasterCard cardholders with a consumer credit or debit card from BMO Harris, Cambridge Savings, Canton School Employees Federal Credit Union, Centennial Bank, Citadel Federal Credit Union, First Community Bank &amp; Trust, First Community Credit Union, Foothill Federal Credit Union, GTE Financial, Hiway Federal Credit Union, KeyBank, Lake Michigan Credit Union, Logix Federal Credit Union, Meijer Credit Union, Mission Federal Credit Union, Point Bank, Prosperity Bank, Sandy Spring Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, US Bank, Wanigas Credit Union, Wesbanco and West Community Credit Union now have access to easier, more secure everyday payments through Apple Pay. In addition, cardholders with a MasterCard small business card from Bethpage Federal Credit Union or Navy Federal Credit Union can also now leverage Apple Pay.

Owners of the new iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 can now use their U.S. MasterCard consumer credit or debit cards from a growing list of banks and credit unions through Apple Pay. Security and privacy is at the core of Apple Pay. When you add a credit or debit card into Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorized with a one-time unique security code.

“People are passionate about their devices and they’re ready for their connected devices to do more – including acting as a commerce device – as is evident by the positive reception and uptake of Apple Pay,” said Matt Barr, group head, U.S. Emerging Payments MasterCard. “Consumers want to be able to shop where they want, when they want and how they want – and they want to do so with the confidence that their money is safe and secure no matter how they choose to pay. Issuers are delivering on this by enabling their cards within emerging payment platforms like Apple Pay that deliver consumer choice.”

To help consumers use Apple Pay, MasterCard has developed the MasterCard Nearby app, available in the App Store, which helps you easily find merchants near your current location that accept contactless payments.",finance,1431011778
financialindependence,Solution to recent thread about a change of atmosphere in this sub,"My post is in response to this post http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/353tof/has_anyone_noticed_the_change_in_this_sub_lately/

Change is inevitable.

Their are a few constants in this sub.

1) This sub likes its numbers. Custom Excels, Mint, Betterment, 80/20 Asset Allocation, Simple math to FI by MMM, 4% withdrawal, tax brackets, inflation rate, etc.

2) This sub wants to help others who want to help themselves.

I feel a great way to get this sub organized as it continually grows towards 100,000 users is to begin developing an expansive wiki and sidebar.

Essentially looking at /r/FI as /r/pf on steroids. You can't be FI until you have mastered the majority of /r/pf skills. In this wiki we could create popular topics that link to successful posts in this sub, link back to /r/pf or reference MMM or FIentist etc. 

Along with these text sections linking back to other texts, there should be some in-house graphics and excel systems that can provide visual representation of certain topics.

The great thing about developing these concepts is that instead of small voting wars breaking out on posts, we can simply link users to the wiki and move on to the more important posts. As users begin developing sections and creating graphics and tools they can post their work and get feedback and approval before the mods post it in the wiki. This will promote productive conversations and challenge the creators to make comprehensive resources that fit to everyone's situation. This will also allow the more talented users in this sub to merit ""wiki contributor"" tags and insure that new users know that the information they are posting is founded on good knowledge (because FI advice can sometimes sound insane).

Suggestions for tools and graphics to create:

MMM's Simple math to early retirement graphics but with the ability to adjust interest rate and tax bracket.

Comprehensive tax forms that show what taxes you will have to pay when withdrawing money in retirement. i.e. you enter how much you plan to take out of the traditional account and the form shows how much gets taken off for taxes, FICA, medicare, etc.

I also at the time got the 5K first time home buyers ""loan"" that I have to pay back 500 dollars each year from the federal government (if I waited 2 weeks to close, I would have gotten the 5k loan that you don’t have to pay back.  Aint that a bitch?)  So, looking at what these units are selling for, it would seem that I'm under water.  Some units have gone for as little as 65-68k.  Most of which are all outdated though, where as my unit I've put in a new kitchen, and done a lot of work to the bathroom.

I would love to rent the unit out, but the co-op board makes it absurd to deal with.  I need to pay the board itself $400 dollars, then pay the management company $500 dollars.  In addition to that, they require that we also put down one month of maintenance fee's which is about $850.  Now what their sublease doc says is that the 500 to the management board is per tenant, so if I were to rent to a couple it would be 1000 dollars instead of 500.   Now none of this guarantees that the board will approve the renters.  So If they deny it, I could be out at least 4-900 dollars.  Now if they approve the rental, they only allow lease agreements for one year at a time.  So if I want to rent it a second year I need to pay all the fee's again and go through their approval process again.  After two years, they require that you demonstrate significant financial hardship to be even considered to be allowed to rent a third year.  What they mean by financial hardship is not clearly defined, and from what I can tell leaves it up to the whim of the board.  And unfortunately, they're pretty scummy people so who knows what they'll do.

That withstanding,  my wife and I want to buy a house so we can start a family.  We've saved up about 68k so far and are trying to figure out whats manageable.  The houses we're looking at range anywhere from 325,000 to around 380,000.  Property taxes range anywhere between 6-14k a year depending on the different towns.  My wife and I both have perfect credit (790) last time I looked.

economy,I know there are two other reasons deflation is considered bad.,"From what I understand, the reason economists view deflation as a bad thing for economies is that when people notice prices dropping, they develop the idea that they should hold off on purchases, expecting to be able to get more and more for their money as time passes. This behavior stunts the growth of economies and leads to higher unemployment, etc., because employers are left with less income to hire, raise salaries, grow their companies, etc. That's why 2% inflation is considered optimum (not too high, not too low).

High duration equals high volatility
 Low interest rate (coupon) equals high volatility
 And vice versa

Hawkish = raising rates
 Dovish = vice versa, stimulus

PLEASE LIST THE TWO OTHER REASONS WHY DEFLATION IS BAD: They have to do with lending money.

personalfinance,Graduating med school and starting residency in July. I have a lot of questions about what I should be doing.,"**EDIT:** Thanks for all the responses. They've been insanely helpful and given me a lot of stuff to read about and learn. I hope this is helpful for any other med students out there who are graduating and looking for some direction. I can't recommend the White Coat Investor book enough. It's written in plain English so that even a dummy like me can understand it. 

----

 I've never taken a single finance or economics class. Ever. I'm trying to read up on my own between now and July on what I need to be doing but if anyone has any guidance that would be great.

I have approx. $170k in med school debt (all Stafford or Grad PLUS loans at various interest rates), no undergrad debt, no other private debt. I will be making about $50k next year as an intern. I have a significant other who will be making about $30-40k for the foreseeable future but we are not married (yet). My residency will be 5 years after which my earning potential will be around $250-300k/year.

I've read through The White Coat Investor book and have gotten an idea of things to do and have spoken with my parents about how to go about setting up some of them, but I'm still fuzzy on certain concepts and was hoping you guys could clarify. I've also tried to set up a meeting with the financial aid person at my university but that won't be for another week or so.

First off, how do I student loan? I know I want Pay As You Earn during residency rather than forbearance, but how exactly do I make payments... like, where do I go to actually do that? If I make PAYE payments during the 6 month grace period are those qualifying payments for PSLF? Are payments made during the grace period eligible for the student loan interest deduction? My thinking is that if I do PAYE during residency and end up in academics I should be able to take advantage of PSLF after 10 years, and if I end up in private practice after residency then I will just switch to standard repayment. I know I will end up paying more in the long term by paying the minimum amount during residency if I go private practice, but the monthly financial flexibility during residency is worth it to me. 

Second, how do taxes work with an abrupt change in income? I earned $0.00 for the first six months of 2015, but will make $25k for the last six months. When I file my taxes, do I file based on the $25k I actually made or will I need to pay taxes on the monthly salary which comes out to $50k/year? And just to be clear, my first year of residency I should be eligible for a $4000 tax deduction from my spring tuition which was paid for by loans according to [this](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch06.html)? Are there any other deductions I should know about other than that, student loan interest, and IRA/403(b) contributions that are above the line? As far as I can tell for residents it's easier and better to just take the standard deduction and personal exemption than try to itemize, is that a safe assumption?

Third, what is the optimal way to save for retirement? My residency program does not provide any match at all during residency for their 403(b), so my current plan is to max out a Roth IRA, then put a small amount of money into my 403(b) and a small amount of money into an individual investment account for big purchases down the line (down payment on a house, etc). I also plan to get a separate bank account for an emergency fund, and a regular savings account from a community bank that gives 3% interest if you meet certain conditions.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I really appreciate any help you guys can offer. I'd also appreciate recommendations for books to read about this kind of stuff. I've already got a few on my list that were recommended in The White Coat Investor, but please recommend any others you think would be helpful!",finance,1431020070

My girlfriend and I will be moving back to my mom's house for 6-9 months for me to accumulate money for when I go to The University of Utah in a year. During this time, I am planning to save up around $15,000 and will be to $20,000 by the time I get to the university.  
  
My initial plan was to use this to avoid student debt, however, after a conversation with a friend, I am reconsidering where that money should go. His argument was that I can easily beat the interest rates of a student loan in the market and therefore the math says I should invest to get the most out of the money. My work will reimburse $5,250 a year for school and I imagine that I should be able to pay them off quick once I'm finished.

personalfinance,"Federal Student Loans $350,000 (consolidated) @ 6.9%","My wife has $350,000 of consolidated student loans at 6.9%.  She is eligible for, and already enrolled in Income Based Repayment (15% of discretionary income over 25 years, with any remaining balance forgiven and taxed at the end).

We used [this calculator](http://www.finaid.org/calculators/ibr/phtml), and the following settings:

* Year of forgiveness: 25 years

* Tax filing status: married filing separately 

* Adjusted Gross Income (student): $80,000

* Expected Income Jump (student): $100,000

* Years after graduation (student): 5

* First loan (unsubsidized): $350,000 @ 6.9%

Any other settings we left as standard or blank. **Edit: Discount rate adjusted to 2.91% as per /u/loopy212 comment below.**

From the calculator it seems like the best option financially, by comparing Net Present Value, is to ride it out for forgiveness. We know that it will leave a potentially very large tax bill in year 25 but discounting that back to now still makes it look attractive in comparison. It will also give us 25 years to plan for it. We also think we have been very conservative with the numbers we put into the calculator. I know there are many tax deductions we can make to her AGI to minimize IBR payments, and there may be periods around when we have kids where her income may drop. Congress may also make the final forgiveness tax free over the next 25 years. 

On the other hand, we know there are risks with this approach. The calculator is making assumptions which if they are off can compound dramatically over 25 years, and there is a possibility that congress will change the scheme to our detriment (and we may or may not be grandfathered in). We will also have this hanging over us and factoring into our financial planning for the next 25 years.

Can anyone offer advice on how we are viewing this and if we are missing anything important?

personalfinance,Not sure if we should refinance.,"Last year we closed on our townhouse and had a mortgage of $314K on a purchase price of $349K. Rather than traditional PMI, we got a slightly higher interest rate of 4.625%. In the year since, we've been able to throw bonuses and wedding money at our mortgage and have brought it down to 283K.

Looking online at rates and closing costs published by banks, I was seeing the option to refinance to 4% with $3500 in closing costs. It seems like a no brainer, but we're not actually sure if we're going to stay here all that long. I  have a new job much closer to where my husband works and we like the idea of moving closer to there. So while the math says we'd save about $100/mo in interest, it would take nearly 3 years to make up the closing costs (according to this calculator http://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/refinance-calculator/).

However, because we've thrown so much extra capital at our mortgage in the last year, refinancing would lower our monthly payment by $300 total from my calculations. I know this means our loan is back to 30 years instead of the 25 or so we've got it down to (I actually have no idea, I made that up), but the idea of bringing down our required monthly payment is certainly appealing, if only for peace of mind if one of us were to lose a job. I'm just not sure how to weight that in the equation.

So that was a bit of rambling, but thoughts on if it makes sense to do so? Staying 3 more years is certainly not guaranteed, even when we bought we weren't planning for much more than 5 tops.

We also have the option of refinancing to a 15 year mortgage which would increase our monthly payment about $200/mo. It's certainly an amount we could afford, but I don't love the idea of that payment if something were to happen.",finance,1431045661

Back in 2009, I married the absolute wrong man. And that is when all my money troubles began.. just looking at my credit report, it was all excellent until about 6 months into the marriage, when all of a sudden I lost my job. My husband, who was here in the US on an expired work visa wasn't earning very much &amp; I was forced to basically work for tips. I tried my best, but the hole kept getting deeper. He refused to contribute to any bills and I had to let things slip. Eventually, the only money I was allowed was money to buy him groceries or to pay the bill for power &amp; internet, since he couldn't be without his computer. I should have left much sooner than I did, but abusive situations are hard to extricate yourself from.

By the time I did leave (2.5 years later), the financial hole was so deep I couldn't even bear to think about it. I also was without steady income for 3 years after the divorce, so even if I'd wanted to make payments, I couldn't have when I was living on less than $100/week. Now I have a steady job, &amp; I want to do whatever I can to dig myself out of this hole. So that's my backstory. I know I shouldn't have buried my head in the sand, but what's done is done &amp; all I can do now is try to move forward &amp; make it right.

Onto the debt:

* Approximately $38k is from federal student loans. I have already been in contact with the company handling them &amp; am enrolled in the loan rehabilitation program to get me out of default &amp; into good standing.
* Approximately $20k is medical debt. I had a couple of ER visits for a recurring problem &amp; apparently my insurance was inactive at the time, though I was still covered under my mother's insurance at the time. I have no idea why insurance denied the claims &amp; I don't have any records from my visits any longer (again, leaving an abusive situation is difficult..)
* The rest of the debt is from private student loans &amp; credit cards. I believe at least one of these items was opened fraudulently by my ex-husband, as it's for AT&amp;T but I have never had an account with them in my life. Regardless, this is a small amount &amp; merely a drop in the bucket of my debt.

Onto now. My approximate take-home each month is $1820. Between bills &amp; essentials (food, gas), approximately $1540 is spoken for each month. Leaving me with less than $300/mo to put towards paying down my debt. And that's not including putting money aside for an emergency fund for any unforeseen expenses. How on earth am I ever going to manage to pay nearly $50k back when I have so little to put towards paying it off? 

I've been researching debt consolidation, debt management plans, bankruptcy.. but I have no idea what is the right option for me. I've been looking into free credit counseling from a DoJ approved non-profit, but my boyfriend seems to think they are all a scam &amp; that I am too nice &amp; will get suckered into something.. will I?

economy,Fitch: Low Oil Prices Provide Marginal Benefit to Emerging Market Corporates,"Fitch Ratings has published a special report entitled, 'Effect of Low Oil Prices on Emerging Market Corporates.' This report takes a look at the cash flow impact upon corporates of lower oil prices in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and South Africa. The impact is positive throughout Asia but neutral in Latin America. Throughout EMEA, the results are mixed.

Fitch believes Brazilian and Mexican corporates can expect no positive impact in terms of credit quality despite low oil prices.

'In Brazil, prices are highly regulated and have risen in U.S. dollar terms due to the depreciation of the Brazilian real. Fuel isn't a large part of the consumer's daily expenses, nor does it make up a large portion of the inflation basket,' said Joe Bormann, Managing Director and Deputy Regional Group Head of Fitch's Latin America Corporate group.

More than one out of every four Brazilian corporate issuers rated by Fitch has a Negative Rating Outlook or is on Rating Watch Negative. Consumer and producer confidence have fallen to levels not seen since 2009. Inflation continues to hover at around 8% despite multiple increases in interest rates.

'In Mexico prices also remain highly regulated, and lower international oil prices will not positively impact Mexican corporates' cash flow,' said Bormann. 'Fitch expects upgrades and downgrades to be evenly balanced during 2015 in Mexico despite no positive cash flow benefit from lower oil prices globally.'

Fuel prices in Brazil are established by Petrobras, which has the only refineries in Brazil and supplies in excess of 95% of the country's liquid fuel demand. In Mexico, energy reform will result in the liberalization of fuel prices by 2018, which will then result in local prices closely mirroring international prices. Until then, prices remain heavily regulated.

I am an addict, and I am  one that works daily on my recovery, I see a therapist 1 time a week, I see an addition specialist doc once a month, I then do regular check ups with my main doctor as well. This has kept me clean for the last 4 months, and I knock on wood it will continue that way, one day at a time. 

The house that we bought when we first got married, is in my wifes name only, though it's been my money paying for it. We own 3 vehicles, worth around $100,000 for all 3, then a boat and a jet ski. Dogs, no kids, our American family that worked for us until it didn't

Now, over the years, my wife has come to have justified resentment over my addiction, my only cheating on her was with the pills, outside of that, the bane has been my pill addiction and the lies i told her to get more pill, never cheated on her, and I would be home most all days straight from work, no nights out partying just home chilling with my dogs that I love. I am a very successful person, to where the last 10 years I have made no less than $100,000 a year. My wife makes $30k-$49k a year depending what year we are talking about, a couple years she did not work at all, collected unemployment and I covered everything.

The reason I am writing this, is within the last 1.5 years. I have really started to do well. I average no less than $20,000 per month, gotta pay taxes out of it, which all of this money goes directly into my wife's account, which I can log into. Now my wife set up another account, an ING account, that she transfers part of my check into this, example, I made $30,000 in one month, so $15,000 went to the ING to hold for 1st quarter taxes.  She has been holding back 50% of my money into another account for taxes like this for 19 separate deposits of my payroll. Out of those 18 of them I can see leaving the bank and being sent, totaling $110,008. When the quaters come, she goes and get checks for the exact amount of what I need to send off to the Feds n States, this leaves money in the ING account. 

I was not alarmed with things, until I found a weird letter, that I am convinced, but I have doubt as well, that my wife has has 2 lesbian affairs. I have confronted her about the letter and the affairs, at first she had no idea what I am speaking about, Then I showed her the letter, that was in her email, that was sent to my wife, that is speaking about  my wife, and the ""intimate"" moments they shared, as well as talking about my wife just breaking off a 4 month fling with another chick. This hurts, I undersatand why she did it if it happened, but boy I do not se any future if I can confirm it true. This would mean that while I checked myself into a treatment center, she choose to go get laid with her husband working on the right thing, errr.  Though I have cleaned my self up, and this job is going fantastic. Though I feel to much damage has been done to our marriage to ever repair it, I could be wrong.

On March 18th, I asked my wife to send me the account info to log into the ING account, the account that she sends the money to for saving and our taxes, She has flat our refused to give me the log into this, Anytime I ask, she brings up something I have done, and that starts a fight, I have a reminder in my phone daily to ask her for the log in daily, this is going on 2 months now, and she still has yet to give it to me. 

I get paid on the 26th, I have reopened my own account once again. Which I will no longer be sending my money to her account. I am feeling like she is doing this, in order to horde as much of my money that she can knowing that our marriage is going to fail, and she would be able to keep the money since it is in her account.

personalfinance,(NL) Should I pay off part of my mortgage?,"Hi Reddit,

A bit about my personal situation: 23 y/o male, living together with my 25 y/o GF in The Netherlands.

I have a stable full time job, bringing home $2.9K a month. GF has a part time job with varying income.

I recently (december of last year) purchased an appartment and got a $100K mortgage for it. (value is approx. $135K). The mortgage has a 2.9% interest rate and will be paid off over a period of 30 years.

I have no debts at all, beside my mortgage. I own my car and my bike and have approx. $22K in savings. I'm planning on transferring a 6 month emergency fund into a seperate savings account, which will be approx. $10K.

Currnetly my back account offers a 1% interest rate on my savings. Would it be a smart idea to make a payment of $10K on my mortgage? 

When I purchased the appartment the mortgage interest rates were at historical lows, as of today they've hit new historical lows. Besides that the house prices are also very low at the moment.

personalfinance,Questions about investing and a 457b vs a Roth IRA,"First, a big thanks to all who contribute to PF. I've learned a lot just by lurking on these forums and it's what made me realize that I should start investing for retirement. Prior to visiting PF, I knew absolutely nothing about investing (parents have zero stock market investments, so I learned nothing there).

I'll try to keep this short: I am 26 and I work for a state government agency, so I will be receiving a pension when I retire, but I realized that I should supplement this income with some investments. 
I'm single and my only debts are:
Auto loan - ~6k @ 1.9% 
Mortgage - ~150,000 @ 4.0% 

Both interest rates are relatively low, so I figured putting some excess income into investments was a good idea.
The state offers a 457b plan, which i just started contributing to minimally last year. There is a $20/year fee. I currently make Roth contributions to a T. Rowe Price Retirement 2045 Fund based off my expected year of retirement (I want/plan to retire when I hit 55). The expense ratio is listed at 0.78. 

My Questions:
1) Would it be better to contribute to a Roth IRA, with say Vanguard, where the expense ratio seems much lower? Or are there other fees that I am not aware of?
If I were to open a Roth IRA, and if I were to reach the max yearly contribution, I would then start contributing back to the 457b.

2) I was thinking of contributing to the 2055 fund instead, due to it being more aggressive for a longer period. Does it make sense to split contributions between 2045 and 2055 or should I just choose one? 
(I also have the option to pick from a selection of individual stocks, but I don't know enough to feel comfortable doing this.)

I loaned 70.000 at policy rate + 2%. When I got the loan the policy rate was 0.0%, right now it's -0.25% (which makes my current interest 1.75%)

- I’m having a new baby….and I’m pretty sure another baby right after (if I don’t commit suicide)…I have no idea how much im’ gonna spend on a freaking baby lol

Right now the market for homes are increasing in price….so my thinking is that I just wait til the market tanks again and buy when it’s low again…that could be in 5-10 years. 

I don’t think that I can do both…pay new consolidated loan and afford a mortgage.

personalfinance,Help! Selling condo in Texas and HOA manager is sabotaging my deal!,"Long story short, I'm selling my condo in Texas and am scheduled to close in a few weeks. 

The entire process has proceeded without issue, except for the fact that the buyer's lender requires that the HOA manager sign a condo questionnaire and provide the HOAs tax ID. 

The problem?

The HOA manager refuses to release the tax ID on principle. Is this legal?

The HOA is managed by a private LLC. The manager's justification is that they've never been required by a lender to do this, and thus will not abide by this lender's requirement. 

I was told verbatim over the phone that this may kill the deal - which in my honest opinion is utter bullshit. 

What can I do in this situation?

I've looked up the LLC's public tax info with the state of Texas so I have the state tax ID. I'm uncertain whether that is enough, I will get clarification as to whether the lender requires that or the federal EIN. 

One thing I found is that under The Right To Transact Business In Texas, it states FRANCHISE TAX INVOLUNTARILY ENDED. Anyone have any ideas what that means?

personalfinance,Options for Eliminating PMI,"EDIT:

I spoke to my loan officer.  PMI would fall off my loan at 78% LTV but, since it is an FHA loan, ***PMI must be paid on the loan for 5 years.***  Thus, the best option would be to wait until month 60 of my loan and make a single principal only payment for the difference, which in my case would be approximately $21k.

Thanks for responding, u/BenSavageGarden and u/nonameyetgiven!

ORIGINAL POST:

I've been reading a bit about how to get out from under PMI on my current loan.  We bought in a part of town that has a slower rate of home appreciation.  I want to hold on to this property even after we buy a new house, since the interest rate is low and the property is very close to a central urban area, making it a good candidate for renting and for an increased future value.  Based on a few articles I've read (specifically [this one](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/outsmart-pmi.asp)), I want to explore the idea of securing a 15 year second mortgage to put enough equity into my home to eliminate the need for PMI.  Here is the info for my current loan:

* Purchase price of $258,000
* Current principal balance of $239,555
* 3.25% interest rate
* $277.54/mo PMI premium
* I have 28.2 years (338 payments) left on the note


&amp;nbsp;


**Option 1 - Business as Usual**

Pay my current mortgage payment.  PMI falls off at $22% LTV after 79 more months.  Total PMI remaining paid is $21,925 over the life of the loan, or a NPV of $10,611 (assuming a discount rate of 2.12%, the current 10-year treasury bond rate).  The NPV of the remaining interest paid over the life of my current loan would be $27,671.  **Total NPV of PMI and Interest is $38,282.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 2 - Add a Second Mortgage/Large Principal Payment**

The extra principal payment required to reach 22% LTV would be $38,315, which we don't have lying around, so I would get a 15 year 2nd mortgage.  Assuming 6% closing costs and a 3.75% interest rate, the NPV of the interest paid on the 2nd mortgage is $4,676.  PMI goes completely away since I would make 1 large principal payment.  NPV of the interest paid on 1st mortgage is now $22,188 due to the large principal payment I made.  The total payment I would make each month for both mortgage payments would be ~$17.50 more than Option 1.  **Total NPV of Interest and PMI for both loans is $26,864.06**

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 3 - Additional Principal Payments**

Pay ~$200 per month towards extra principal, **NPV of PMI and Interest is $35,775**.  I would need to pay at least $2,840 per month in extra principal for the next 14 months for the NPV of Option 3 to be less than option 2.

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 4 - Refinance and hopefully capture equity**

In my mind this is not an option, as our interest rate is lower than what is currently available today and home prices in our area have not risen enough to capture any appreciable equity.  Also, closing costs would eat up a lot of benefit to refinancing.

&amp;nbsp;

Do any of you all have experience with making this type of decision?  For some this may be way to granular, but I enjoy this kind of research.  What am I overlooking?  What are the traps of taking out a 2nd mortgage?  What decision would you make?  The goal here is eliminate the PMI payments while minimizing the costs that I would pay to do so.  Thanks in advance for any input!

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: There are cheaper alternatives to paying PMI and I want to explore the risks of each option.",finance,1431102751
personalfinance,"Paying off multiple federal student loans, best allocation of each payment?","So I have 32,993 in loans that will come out of deferment later this year. The following is a breakdown of these loans:

2,471 @6.8%


5,568 @3.4%


2,341 @6.8%


5,070 @3.9%

So my dilemma is given that I should have the right to choose where my monthly payment goes on each loan, what is the best strategy for avoiding the most interest? I understand the largest interest rates should go first, starting with the highest principal one of those, but how do I go about this most effectively? 

Should I pay the interest charge on every other loan each month to prevent them from growing and then devote the remainder of the payment to the highest prin highest interest rate loan? Or does that under cut my progress on that loan too much? 

Should I take a few of the sub 3k loans and wipe them out so they no longer add interest to the equation each month? Doing so would allow me to devote more of my payments after that to larger higher rate loans and in theory bring them down quicker and avoid interest that would have otherwise accrued.

Should I take some hybrid of these two theories and prioritize total interest each month, then attack the largest high rate loan while devoting a decent portion to the smaller ones to get rid of them quickly? 

Is loan consolidation a good option or do you end up getting burned by it?

They have this mess set up so it seems impossible to figure out the best way to approach repayment. 

Again I'm assuming I'm allowed to choose where my payments go, this is at least correct right? These are all federal sub and unsub loans.

I could enter my username/password and it would connect and ask if I wanted to link my checking or brokerage account.  No matter what I clicked all that happened was a page refresh without linking.  After the third attempt I was locked out of adding accounts

I contacted support a few weeks ago and when they got back to me I was told I could try again.  I could attempt to link my account but same outcome: pick which account and the page would refresh without linking.

I messaged support again saying I still couldn't link my account.  Here was their response:

personalfinance,Going hard on undergrad loans or putting money towards grad school in the fall? Best long term plan?,"Hey Everyone!

So i'm new to r/pf and I havent found anyone asking a question like mine. I'm moving cross country to attend the most affordable grad school program I got into and I'm trying to plan what is the best long term solution to school debt. NOTE: I have NO other debt other than student loans. I've been out of school for 2 years and have already paid off 15k using the snowball method.

**IN:**

* currently make 2300 per month (42k monthly) 

* saving 400 a month for grad school expenses 

* work a side job with unreliable monthly numbers, but usually about another 100-300 a month lately its been covering wedding/grad gifts 

* 9k already in savings, incl. emergency fund


**OUT:**

* paying 700 on current loans (500 per month towards my parents' PLUS loan and about 200 on my own fed stud loans) total is just shy of 90k

* grad school will cost about 3k after scholarships, high probability of getting an assistantship 2nd yr that will cover all + living expenses

* yearly living expenses budget while in school = 9k high estimate


**Questions:**

1) Does it make sense to pay more than the minimum on the loans I already have or to save the difference to not have to take out more in a new loan? I have the ability to pay off the smallest loan in my name (3k) before I start in august, but I think it may be better to have that in savings to live off of.

2) My payment on the PLUS loan will need to continue to be paid while the fed loans in my name will freeze over the next two years. Does it make sense to take out the equiv (6k) to pay off the PLUS loan in monthly payments? I know id be taking out a loan to pay a loan, but due to my agreement with my parents it may be the best option for my mental sanity. I don't want the stress of coming up short on that debt.

3) The goal is to work while in grad school. My current company has not decided if they will keep me on part time (telework) or not, but I will get a side job at school to make sure I still have some income while in school. Would it be smarter to use that income to pay my frozen loans/new loans or to save that to cushion for the next year? I can't imagine I'll make more than 12 bucks an hr so it wont be lifechanging but it would help with incidentals, etc.

personalfinance,"YSK that for most unsecured personal loans, the higher the term, the higher the APR","While it might seem like common knowledge, there is a shocking amount of applicants that expect the lowest APR a bank may offer for a personal loan (specifically unsecured) that choose the longest repayment term and are shocked by  being offered a higher APR. Regardless of how amazing your credit may be, or you may think it is, choosing a longer term often directly correlates to a bank's higher risk model and therefore a higher APR. The bank will likely not tell you this outright so when you're asking, ""If I choose a lower term, will my interest rate be lower?"" the answer is yes. 

An 84 month term for x amount of dollars may seem attractive for getting a lower payment, but that payment could easily only be within a ~$100 at the highest rate from what your monthly payment would be at say, a 60 month term that would likely result in a much lower rate.

The exception to this ""rule"" are those with excellent credit accompanied by a low debt burden and debt to income ratio. Those people can usually choose any term and be offered a very competitive rate. Of course, if you don't care about the interest you're paying, definitely go for the longest term to have the lowest monthly payment.

personalfinance,MBA at a low price- worthwhile investment?,"Hello PF!
Long-time lurker, first time poster here. Hoping some folks in this community would be willing to weigh-in on my situation.

I am a 23 year-old college graduate (B.S. in Biology from state school). Started this degree with my mind set on medical school. By the time I was nearing completion I was no longer interested in medicine. My grades were fine and my MCAT score was actually quite good, but I found the nature of the work that I had seen through various shadowing experiences to be fairly depressing- the people who can do it are truly saints. I also lost my father junior year after a long battle with cancer which I believe contributed to my distaste for practicing medicine. While in school, I worked part time as a technician for a small IT company and came to enjoy it so upon graduating I stayed there about another year and then took a job at a large (S&amp;P 400) tech company with an office in my home city. I don't love the work I do now and it only pays 35k a year. They provide excellent benefits and I am contributing the maximum amount they will match to my 401(k). After everything is taken out of my checks I'm left with just enough money to pay all my living expenses and pay a bit more than the minimum payment on my undergraduate loans (I owe about 15k in federally subsidized Staffors loans).

My employer also offers tuition re-imbursement for employees seeking a degree that is relevant to their position in the company. My supervisor has approved the use of this program to cover an MBA. A small, private liberal arts school in my city that is well-respected locally offers a 1-year MBA in the form of night classes. It would cost, in total, about 30k, but with my employer's tuition program it will cost about 20k. 

The question is: does this make sense from a PF point of view? I have already determined I see non-monetary value in having the degree. There seem to be good opportunities within the company for MBA grads and I have otherwise taken an interest in entrepreneurship. I am a partner in a small consulting gig on the side that earned us a few thousand last year helping small assisted living organizations with minor IT concerns that other larger firms wouldn't handle for an appropriate price. We are both simply too broke to grow the company to a point where we could take on larger accounts and make it sustainable. 
Does this program sound like it would be a wise investment or would I be better off to save my money and pay off my debt before attempting more education? I believe it would increase my income potential and my ability to possibly find investors for other business ideas I have but I don't know if these things outweight the fact that I would more than double my debt.

Forgive me if this isn't the place to ask and thanks so much in advance!

Edit: fixed a couple typos. On mobile. Apologies.

Edit 2: Thanks for all of the insightful responses everyone! It has given me a lot to consider. I agree with a lot of the points made - for and against. Where I live, my particular employer is well known and highly respected (not trying to toot horns, but it is a smaller metro area and there just aren't many large companies here, especially not in tech), and many people I know who work there have grown in the company without getting any graduate degrees (some don't have any degrees- just technical certifications). However, many of the ones who seem to break out of middle management and eventually into executive level positions do have MBAs. Most from state schools, some from online programs even. I don't believe i have encountered anyone here with a top-10 MBA, not to say there aren't any, but the company's culture is far more concerned with your willingness to demonstrate commitment to your personal growth and to the company than it is to big names and I feel like getting the MBA would set me apart from the multiple other engineers, most of whom have been here way longer than me. 

As far as the MBA program in question, I do believe it is a great school if I wish to stay in this area- which I do. There is an extensive alumni network and the university boasts that many noted business leaders from the area are grads of the MBA program. Are there alum that are executives at Google or GM or any Fortune 500s even? Not that I know of. But in the microcosm of were I live the name carries some water and I feel there would e a great deal of networking opportunities for expanding my career locally, which would be my goal. 

Still a lot of factors to take into account so I will continue to think on it. I keep telling myself that even with the MBA debt, I would be around the national average for undergraduate debt but would have a degree that can earn me considerably more than my biology degree, which I feel is mostly useless unless I want to go to grad/professional school with it.

 Fast forward past some heavy depression and aimlessness to now and I am completing my first year of an engineering degree (another degree, I know not the wisest decision but I needed to distance myself from my past failures, and its working so far) and I work part time at a job I enjoy but unfortunately with near zero upward mobility. My entire debt load is now at 37.5K - all federal student loan debt, mostly subsidized and deferred while in school. Of that 37.5K, 2K is earning 6.8% interest (from originally 23K principal) and the remainder is a more recently borrowed 12K earning 4.6% (borrowed partially to finance education and partially to pay down higher interest debts)

Unfortunately because its engineering I cannot accelerate the curriculum and it will take me another 3 years to finish, however in that 3 years I only have 55 credit hours. My best approximation of the remaining cost is about 24K, at 355/credit hour with fees and marginal increases in tuition  (rough estimate)

My part-time job pays 14/hr anywhere from 15 to 32(occasionally more) hr/wk depending on my academic needs and the job is very flexible for school, 

I live at home with family, no car note, no rent, no cc debt BUT also no savings,no emergency fund, no retirement. I don't have much of a budget because of whatever isn't going to tuition, nearly everything goes into the student loan accruing the highest interest (currently the 2K loan at 6.8%, originally 23K prinicpal). I've occasionally gone on a small spending spree because I feel a tad overwhelmed by the debt burden but I usually corral everything pretty quickly and am mostly pretty focused on making sound financial decisions moving forward.

I just need help on what to do next, my coming year is light on the course load so I can work a lot more. Internships in my field can be lucrative, so that would open things up greatly in the coming summers, but I'm operating under the assumption that I will have my current job only.

personalfinance,150k in student loans- should my parents help with their equity?,"Hello Reddit! 

I have 150k loans in grad student loans. They are an accumulation of separate loans, each varying in principal and interest rates. 3 of the loans are huge (such as 30-40k with 6.8% interests). As of now, I have been paying off for 1.5-2 years around $2330/month.  It has been going down steadily. I also have a 40k+ loan elsewhere that has 5% interest rate and I am paying an extra 500 dollars/month for a 10 year plan but I am not caring for that.

Should I ask my parents to help out by getting a home equity loan? They don't have enough money in their bank account to help but they do have a home equity. I tried researching google but couldn't find the answer or I just didn't understand the answer. I need a ELI5. 

The home my parents have (and I grew up in) cost around 200k at the time of purchase. I'm sure it is appraised for 400-500k now. They bought it back in 1989 so either they paid it all off or have about 5k left on it. They are both retired with no income. Is it still feasible to ask them to get a  home equity loan? Will the bank allow them since they have no income? Their credit rating is most definitely &gt;760. If yes, how much do you think they can take out for a loan? What are the repercussions?

If it matters, my credit rating is 750. My financial relationship with my parents are great. They would help if they know they could. My loans currently will take me 8 years to pay off if I continue the $2330/month route. I think mortgage APR are at the lowest point now, 4-5% so I was just thinking this is the best option. I am not sure if it is worth it to ask my parents to help but I know I am getting reamed every month on interest only.

personalfinance,I'm an European who wants to study in the USA. Please read and help me.,"Hello, I'm going to try to be as thorough as possible with the information in this post. Please read.

I'm an Italian. I'm 20 and I've finished high school. I want to move to the USA and attend college there. Now, if you just want to tell me NOT to do it - please don't.

I'm partially deaf (my deafness is considered ""severe""), so I MIGHT be able to get something out of my disability?

We've estimated my budget to be 20-21k of $ for each year, for 4 years.

The primary issue is of a financial nature - I'd have two main expenses. Tuition and living expenses (plus maybe medical expenses?). My parents have calculated living expenses alone to be around 15k, and medical insurance to be from 1k to 3k. (these numbers look overestimated to me, but I'm not sure how to do my own calculations) And a plane to the USA is going to cost around 1k alone, give or take a few hundreds.

Then there's tuition. I only want an undergraduate's degree (the major would be English). I have considered some options - like, for example, going to a Community College and complete the last two years elsewhere. But even that goes over budget, as Out-of-State tuition would apply to me - and OoS rates for Community Colleges are between 5k and 10k.

I haven't done any standardized tests (ACT and TOEFL) yet, but I've booked for both of them and am fairly confident that I'll do well in them (if it's even going to change anything at all)

______

I've been told that it MIGHT be a possibility to have Out-of-State rates waived and pay the in-state ones. But the information about it is quite nebulous.

I've looked at many schools, and they're all quite expensive. Maybe you know a school that's more affordable?

Being deaf, I've seen that I CAN'T get disability money UNLESS I have worked and paid social security taxes (and even then I've not understood if I'd be even eligible). It could be harder to find a job because of this.

I'm not sure if I would be able work a job ALSO because I'd have to tend to a home (having to live alone most likely - or at most, with one or more roommates - as it seems to be the cheapest option for housing, bills and food), I'd have to study, go to school, and then I need time for myself of course.

I've also seen that, it seems, I'd not be eligible for most federal aid programs.

I cannot even get a student loan UNLESS I find an American co-signer for it (fat chance).

______

Keeping in mind that my budget for this is a yearly $20-21k (as an optimistic estimate) . . .

Can you PLEASE help me find a way to afford goingfor 4 years to university in the USA? If that changes anything, I also plan on settling in the USA after getting the degree.

So far I've looked at a lot of things, but I've not yet found a definitive way to do this, and time is passing inexorably.

I'm at the end of my rope, and I REALLY want to do this. The only other thing that I do *need* apart from this is being able to set some time aside for learning about art/wrting (as it's the career path that I'm most interested in for after the studies).

I feel like I've thought of everything that I could and, short of setting up a fundraiser (which I suspect would be largely fruitless anyway, and would probably also damage my reputation for the future), I can't seem to think of much else.

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans with home equity. Spreadsheet for comparing debt management options?,"I get a little overwhelmed trying to optimize my strategy and making complicated spreadsheets. I know there is a lot of information on this subreddit, but I could really use some pointing in the right direction

My situation:
- late 30's medical student, just finishing my 3rd year. One more to go until I'll be earning about $45-50k as a resident.
- $250,000 in student loan debt. Various interest rates from 6.2% to 7.9%. Likely to grow to $330,000 over the next year.
- $15,000 in credit card debt. 13.9% to 14.9% interest.
- $50,000 in mutual funds and stock. Not sure what the growth has been like recently
- Own a house (not where I live now due to school) with $175k at 5.35% interest and $75,000 at 3.0% (d/t first time home buyer program.) Value according to Zillow is $500k, so hopefully over $200,000 of equity. 

My questions:
1. can I pay off my student loans and pay next years tuition and expenses with a home equity loan even though my only ""income"" is student loans? 
2. Can anyone point me in the direction of a spreadsheet where I can model various scenarios of payment determine the optimum plan?
3. I think I should probably pay off my credit cards with my mutual funds money, but have a really hard time committing to tapping that. There's no way I'd earn more on the investments than I lose on the debt right?

Forex,Let's look at next week's news releases (10 to 16 of May),"Continuing in last week's spirit, let's discuss what news releases you think are going to be important next week and why.

---

**GBP**

The UK elections are over, and with a conservative majority and uncertainty regarding the USD, the GBPUSD pair surged. This next week's Monday we will see what BOE has in mind for the future. No rate hike in sight, but it's time we heard something from the central bank that could get the markets interested in this currency again.

However, we haven't seen any new inflation data this week, so perhaps we will have to wait until the week after to see any interesting developments.

What do you think the BOE are up to?

---

**NZD**

The RBNZ's interest rates are delicate at the moment, as the bank has all but threatened a cut in recent press releases. As always, but specially with this bank, a cut will be dependent on bad data. There is going to be the biannual Stability Report from the central bank. We'll see what Wheeler has to say. This will give us clues as to how to react to future NZD-related news.

---

There's talk that as oil prices return to normal, inflation figures should stabilize across the board (I think it was someone from the BOE who said that?), and that stimulus programs are unnecessary. I don't think Europe's problem will be resolved easily with or without QE, but that's a very complex debate for another day.

What do you think of the inflation situation in the UK and Europe? What's in the future for Australia and New Zealand?

Do you think the recovery of the US economy is stable? Is the Fed being effective? When do you see a rate hike happening?

personalfinance,Who is the Owner of your Bank Deposit?,"Most people have some money in the bank.  It may be just enough to cycle paying the bills, or it can be many $100,000s.

Who really is the owner of the money you have deposited?

Why its simple, the Bank owns it.  You merely have a claim upon it.

For a very clear explanation see:
http://www.silverdoctors.com/frb-bail-ins-you-dont-own-your-money/#more-53235

""Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal; it is then the money of the banker, who is bound to an equivalent by paying a similar sum to that deposited with him when he is asked for it. … The money placed in the custody of a banker is, to all intents and purposes, the money of the banker, to do with it as he pleases; he is guilty of no breach of trust in employing it; he is not answerable to the principal if he puts it into jeopardy, if he engages in a hazardous speculation; he is not bound to keep it or deal with it as the property of his principal; but he is, of course, answerable for the amount, because he has contracted, having received that money, to repay to the principal, when demanded, a sum equivalent to that paid into his hands. 

In very clear terms, when you deposit funds in a bank account, those funds are no longer yours.  You become an unsecured creditor, or lender, to the bank. Interest payments are supposed to compensate you for the risk in lending funds to the bank but today’s interest rates – being close to zero – do not compensate you for that risk.""",finance,1431169442

personalfinance,"Parents and I stuck in a terrible housing situation, need advice","My parents are retired due to health reasons, so I live with them and pay all their bills, etc.

About 5 years ago, when their health was better, they needed my sister to co-sign on a house for them. I would gladly have done so, but my credit was (and still is) shot. They had managed to find a bargain of a house and, with my sister's good credit, managed to get a really low interest rate.

About 6-8 months ago, work started to cut back my hours. My father got sick (again) and spent some time in the hospital. At the same time, my mother needed extra care. As a result, I started to fall behind on all bills. The mortgage has ALWAYS been paid on time, but sometimes it's been a few days after the due date. The bank assured my parents (multiple times) that this was fine and wouldn't be reported to a credit bureau and there's no danger of forclosure. Indeed, their credits scores continues to go up a little. 

Because my sister's on the mortgage, the bank automatically sends her notification when the mortgage is paid. She apparently noticed that the mortgage was paid a few days late, though not late enough to be charged a fee/start forclosure proceedings, and started harrassing my parents. At various times, she has demanded:

1.) We let one of her druggie friends move in. She pockets all of the rent.

2.) We find a roomate. She pockets approximately 75% of the rent.

3.) We let her husband's family crash, when they're in the area. No money involved.

4.) She gets to use part of the house as storage for her eBay business, coming and going as she pleases.

5.) Refinincing the house. Because having two houses that are PAID ON TIME is adversely affecting her maxed-out-credit-card ass and she should get AT LEAST 50% of the refinance money as reparation for her to sign a quit-claim deed.

Because she never signed as a tenant-in-common but as a non-owner occupied, my parents and I have been (politely) telling her no. She has never, not once, contributed anything to the upkeep of the property nor towards supporting my parents. 

Moving a roomate in with my sick parents is absolutely not an option. We don't have a spare bedroom and, even if they crashed on the couch, the increase in utility bills would make it a money-losing proposition. 

We can't sell the house and buy another because of credit issues. Also, there's a 50/50 chance that the bank would cut HER the check and we'd never see a dime, leaving us all out on the street.

Renting even a 1-bedroom  apartment in this area would cost almost twice what we're paying for this house and that's before utilities.

We're in a bad spot financially at the moment, and she's taking advantage of it in revenge because my parents didn't approve of her pimp-husband (literal pimp, that's what he did/does for work). She doesn't live anywhere nearby, but she's even started anonymously calling the cops on us for things like late-night loud music and whatever else she can think of. The police are very gracious about it and I understand it's not their fault at all, but they still have to investigate and I consider it to be harassment. 

I'm doing various things to get caught up on bills and should be in a much better position in 6-12 months. I've got better pay, better insurance, etc. But I'm also petrified that my sister is going to try to get me fired next, in order to force my parents from their home. 

I'm at my wits end as to what to do, because my parents and I could lose everything if she keeps this up. She may even force a partition sale for ""her"" half of the money.

TL;DR: Because I'm paying all my parents' expenses and all the upkeep on the house, can I sue my sister for her half of the house? Can my parents? What's the quickest and least expensive way to end this financial relationship?",finance,1431180290

worldpolitics,"Corporate America is being allowed to ruin us--while We the People are being over-taxed, over-fined and over-regulated...I seriously Fear that our constant and unnecessary military actions (which just make the Rich even Richer) will start WWIII...","[The USG allows the bankers to walk away from prosecution](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/05/no-wrongdoing-here-just-6300-corporate-fines-and-settlements.html). If a citizen transfers money illegally or commits mortgage fraud--we'd be locked up, but the banks are allowed to make out of court settlements with no prosecution on the record. But We the People must follow the ever-increasing library of laws and regulations now imposed on us.

The USG allows the DoD to write their own checks with [no audit necessary](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part2)--while the citizens and small businesses of the country follow the law and submit their taxes or face serious penalties. Every taxpayer, business, and government agency in America is supposed to be able to pass a financial audit by the feds, every year. It’s the law, so we do our duty. There’s one exception: the Pentagon--which is even so bold as to announce it has misplaced [TRILLIONS](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget) of dollars.

The USG allows the intelligence agencies to trample our rights and the U.S. Constitution--no serious investigation of the NSA has taken place. We do not know the true actions of the CIA-FBI-DoD because of the extreme secrecy. How can we possibly know if the agencies are acting in our interest--and within the law--if we do not even know what they have done?

The USG allows our law enforcement to [jail millions](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/13/wonkbook-11-facts-about-americas-prison-population). They would rather pay for our citizens to be jailed than pay for our children to receive the best education or provide training for those who need it.

The USG attacks other countries around the globe--JSOC has boots on the ground in about [100 countries right now](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/14/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-us-has-military-personnel-130-nation/). Will we end up in another ""war""? Will it be in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? Iran? Korea? China? Russia? Will it be because they attacked our soil or because we are protecting the business interests of the .01%?

The [USG also wages economic warfare against other countries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-a6jzU0YgQ) which leads to instability and is not a peaceful long-term solution. 
We do not need to [overthrow other governments](http://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list)--they have a right to be their own sovereign nation and to live peacefully. Other nations have a right to make their own laws and choose their own leaders.

The [USG would rather invade other countries and build military bases](http://www.rawstory.com/2013/05/authorization-for-use-of-military-force-a-blank-check-for-war-without-end/) and infrastructure over there than upgrade our own infrastructure. I wish most of our soldiers were employed out of the military--building roads, high-speed rail lines, and green energy infrastructure in the U.S (and around the globe--HELPING people).

The USG allows corporations to write our laws: agriculture, banks, energy, healthcare, media/cable conglomerates, transportation, tax laws...

FINALLY: The USG allowed our country to be attacked on 9/11 with no open investigation. In fact, our leaders openly resisted the investigations of both the [Joint Intelligence Committee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0) and the [9/11 Commission](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/911thebigcoverup). Evidence was destroyed, the investigations were [obstructed](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) and the evidence hidden from We the People (and the world). GW Bush couldn't even testify under oath and in public before the 9/11 Commission--he held a [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) press conference afterwards.

I do love America--but the USG is FAILING. Our leaders should be concentrating on helping us--the tax payers--instead of bombing other countries around the globe and leading us into another War. Who is running things--the Pentagon? the CIA? the defense companies? the bankers?

I seriously FEAR that WAR, INC will take things too far--and the Corporate Perpetual War may very well end up in [WWIII](http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/04/15/will-washington-kill-us-paul-craig-roberts/).",energy,1431184410

personalfinance,Advice on saving for a house/retirement/investing,"I'd love to get your take on our current finances and what we could do better.  I'm in my early 30s, my spouse is early 40s.  First baby on the way in a few months.   Sorry if this is long, just want to explain the whole picture.  

Current Finances: 

- Savings for a house:  300k in capitol one 360 savings account (.07 interest generally).  This is our savings to buy a house.  Spouse is in the military and we move every few years, so we expect to buy a house in 5-10 years or so, either in San Diego or San Antonio.   Based on advice on this subreddit and other resources, I started a vanguard 500 account that now has 3k in it.  We're going to get about 12k in extra pay in the next few months which I plan to invest in a Vanguard VTSAX as well.  

- Retirement:  spouse has 69k in a traditional IRA with pioneer plus about 9k in First Command investment accounts.  I have 34k in my TSP, 15k in spouse TSP.  My husband will be eligible for a significant military pension in 5-10 years (when he decides to retire), probably somewhere around 65k per year depending on various factors.  He'll continue to work for another 15 years after retirement probably.  Mostly free health care for both of us right now and when he retires.  

- about 30k in various other savings accounts 

- DEBT:  I have about 22k in student loan debt, federal Stafford, about half subsidized half unsub. I have about 8 of 10 years towards public interest loan forgiveness for this loan.   No other debts.  

Plan:  
I'm getting out of the military soon when the baby is born.  I plan to go back to school to get a degree in the medical field (2 years of part time (while caring for baby) to finish the pre-requisites at a junior college and 3 years full time for the degree).  I'll use my GI bill for the degree part, and I'll savings for the pre-reqs at a JC.  I estimate pre-reqs will cost about $7k in tuition and books.  Child care could be pricey during class time but the military child care program is $4 an hour, which we're eligible for, so I estimate child care to be about $500 per month.  I plan to defer the student loan debt while in school and once I get a job in the public health sector, resume payments for 2 years to get the public interest loan forgiveness.  Based on my husband's income, in a few months after I get out of the military, we should be able to continue to put about $500 per month towards my husband's TSP and the IRA, I'm thinking 400 towards the TSP, 100 to the IRA.  Then we'll have about $1500 or so in extra income which I plan to put in the Vanguard accounts, which we could use to add to our house savings later on and/or some savings for the baby.  My husband will transfer his GI bill to the baby so he'll have a lot of his college paid for, but we may have another baby later one, which we'd do a 529 plan for probably.    

Do you think we should put more towards retirement?  Do you think we should leave the 300k in the capitol one 360 account or put more towards investing?  I'd like to leave a good chunk the 300k it as fairly liquid and relatively safe.

I was unable to work during the rather exhaustive clinical requirements of my degree. As a result I'm leaving school with $176k in debt, mostly graduate plus loans (7%). My new job will pay $150k a year.

Assets: $87k combined IRA ($6.6k in a Roth). ~$7k cash once I start working.

Debt: $176k student loans, ~$7k credit card debt. 

Monthly Expenses: $100 cell phone, $2k loan payment to start in November, $300 in food, $150 utilities, $1,250 rent. 

Monthly Income: $12,500 before taxes. Net is going to be roughly $8,000-$8,800, not sure exactly what it will come to after insurance, taxes, etc.

Plan: I'm looking at ~$4k in free cash per month. First and foremost is to build a small cash nest egg of ~5K. Then proceed to put all available cash in paying off my credit card. Loan repayment will have started by then. Proceed to build a nest egg of $20k that will remain untouched. 

Save $5,500 to put in my Roth before the end of the year as I will be ineligible next year due to salary. Then talk to my financial advisory (whom I've had for over 5 years) and begin monthly contributions to both the IRA graveyard I have with him and into a cash mutual fund for wealth building.

The reason I am not doing an IRA with my company is that they offer no matching. If I work for them for 24 months, starting the 25th month they begin contributing 14% of my base salary into an IRA without any contribution from me.

The question is how much do I invest and how much goes towards paying down my student debt. The obvious answer is ALL available cash should go towards paying down the loans given their high interest rate. However, being in school for 3 years has stopped all financial progress and I think it would be unwise to completely abandon wealth accumulation altogether.

I'm thinking $500 to both the IRA and the Cash mutual fund per month to begin with.

Thoughts? Any glaring holes in this plan? Thanks in advance!

I've been keeping it separate in order to keep my EFC low on my FAFSA, and because my dad contributes to it here and there - anything we can spare. My parents are pretty financially responsible, and we're just your typical lower-middle class family - but I'll be the first person to admit that I grew up very conscious of/concerned about money, to the point where I can definitely be stingy.

Just now, my dad and I were sitting and talking about some old things he wanted to sell to help my little fund, and it slipped out that my parents had used some of it - $420, to be precise - in the fall to pay for some badly-needed repairs on our roof without asking me, and hadn't replaced it. 

Now, I have a really, really strong relationship with my parents. I'm more upset that they didn't ask if they could use it, but my parents explained that the roofing estimate and the final bill were off by a bit, so they had to cobble a little more together. That I can understand and I most likely would've said yes if they had asked (considering I also live under this roof for a third of the year), but it didn't occur to them to do so.

I'm also a little miffed at how easily they hand-waived $400 - true, it's not a lot of money in the big scheme of things, but it's a lot to a broke-ass college kid who grew up with almost nothing. My parents have vowed to replace it and then some, but I'm hurt that they're not taking it seriously and they're not concerned at all (and I've told them as much).

Now that I've typed this out, I'm kinda pissed, but more importantly I'm not sure what to do. I'm going to be away working for more than half the summer, and I'm not stupid enough to keep 1.5k+ in straight cash sitting around anywhere. My bank only gives like .01% in interest, and even though it won't do much to my EFC I'm still nervous about that being impacted. I'm just really bummed out that I have to consider these options at all - I just don't want anything else to happen to my money.

Thanks in advance.",finance,1431209191

Josh was 38th with top speed of 182.729 in Practice 1, then moved up to 32nd in Practice 2 with a 186.393. He started off in decent shape in Qualifying before being moved to last place, but with a few minutes left, he hit another lap and moved to 38th, before being bumped twice more to starting 40th... whew! Not his best start (32nd last May), but he'll make up 10 or so spots before you know it =)

personalfinance,Investing in stocks for the dividends.,"I'm relatively young. I have some extra cash and I would like to invest a little bit in stocks with dividends so I will have a little extra income but at the same time make a long term investment in a stock.

Also when I say stock it could also mean an index or something similar.

What amount of money would I have to invest to make it worthwhile? I would be relatively okay with losing 1000$ in the short term if I were to gain it back within 5 or so years either by the stock coming back up or through cumulative dividends.

If I were to hold the stock for like 50 years, would dividend stocks measurably increase in value adjusted for inflation, or would all my gains come from the dividends. Am I better off just investing in a stock and holding it for 50 years?

Can I just purchase from the S&amp;P 500 or something similar, and do indexes pay dividends.

Mostly I'm interested in getting some simple interest (That could be reinvested) in the form a dividends without having to sell the stock, and some compound interest that can be sold 50 years from now or something.

Also for a divided stock what return can I expect yearly? Say the stock costed 100$ to buy, usually how much dividends per share is payed out?

I have quite a bit of money in bonds etc but they are gaining about 1.5% interest, but I don't even think they matching inflation. I don't want to see my money being devalued because I'm responsible and don't spend it. 

Edit: I'm in Canada

Edit: Side Question - I have over 5000$ in my checking account. I think it gained 3cents in interest last month. Is there a way I can put it into a relatively liquid account. For instance the checking account is good if I need to make lots of transactions, but I don't need to do with 5000$, so is there some account that can earn a meaningful interest rate, while still being liquid enough that I could maybe make 1 free transaction a year or something?",finance,1431224735

Just a year ago I was convinced (by my father) to buy a brand new car, he always did, so he expects me to as well.  I could afford it, beautiful car (13' Regal).  I love the car, but hate the fact that the value of the car is just barely above the loan amount.  ($30k car, $10k down payment, $290 monthly at 1.5%, loan rate is excellent at least)

I made the decision to never have to get a loan for a car again.  My wife and I started saving for a used car for her, her car had 100k+ miles.  We figured for 17-20k we could get a decent used car for long distance trips, salvaging the warranty on mine (I work 7 days a week most of the year 30-60min commutes).  

An opportunity came up through a family friend, they were selling their 2002 Infiniti I35, with ONLY 52k miles!  At first I scoffed at the idea, a car that old, but they were willing to sell it to me at dealer price, $4350.  The only thing I had to worry about was an old car, the owner even waxed the engine.  We had already saved more than that, but jumped on the opportunity.  We may have been able to get a used car for 30k miles for 15-20k, but the mileage difference for the price difference was crazy.  After some research, math and self convincing, I didn't turn my nose up at it, and it turns out it is a real nice car.  Swapped out the radio for bluetooth and hands free (cell phones are technically illegal in a moving vehicle in this state, also the FM/AM radio sucks around here), and now I don't mind putting miles on a car for once.  Due to that, my Roth is maxed for the year, and we can fully focus on maxing my wife's Roth as well!  It is a crazy idea to be excited about socking money away for most Americans.

We have used it sparingly and paid mainly out of pocket for education costs when possible. I now have two years left and my education costs are about $20,000 a year ($40,000 total for remaining time). They have increased due to changes in schooling and such. The problem is the situation with my noncustodial parent isn't the best and as such I report the dividends used on my 529. As such, it shows up as untaxed income on my 1040, so when I apply for financial aid the following year (the school is actually about 70k/year), it is looked at poorly and I might receive less aid. Usually, the parent reports that, but my parent is unwilling to. Untaxed income for students is calculated differently into aid than untaxed income for parents, from my understanding. According to some sites, I should try to withhold withdrawing from the account until my last year as they use the prior year's information to determine financial aid. I have considered taking out loans for the coming year, using the 529 the following year, then using the 529 to pay off the loans after graduation. I do understand the 529 cannot be used to pay off loans easily as they are not considered ""education expenses.""

personalfinance,SL/Debt paydown strategy/consolidation question. ~$125k (x-post r/studentloans),"**Background**

I've been done with school for about 5 1/2 years now. My original principal when I graduated was approx $140k. After about a year of deferment &amp; forbearance (I was very broke and stupid) my total balance turned into ~$154k, and this is the point that I started to get things in order and turn it around. 

When I began paying on the loans, I had 3-4 separate federal loans with various companies and about 15 private loans with 2 different companies (Sallie Mae &amp; Citi). I immediately sought to consolidate them all into one loan, which was what everyone said was so easy and smart, but had no luck. I ended up getting 3 hard inquiries on my credit report from 3 different consolidation lenders (BB&amp;T, Wells Fargo, &amp; dont remember) to only be offered a longer term, higher interest rate, and higher monthly payment than the total of all my loans combined for the consolidation loan. 

Private loan consolidation was out the window with my credit. I consolidated the federal loans (now with Nelnet), and have a separate low balance federal loan with AES. I did my best to work with Sallie Mae &amp; Citi on refinancing and other options, but they basically told me to kick rocks. Sallie Mae since became Navient and Citi sold half my balance to Discover. When I first started making payments in 2010, it was a total of ~$1500/month. Since consolidating the federal and paying some balances down, I'm now paying an average of $1,170. This is a good portion of my take-home, and obviously is my #1 priority. I'd like to get the monthly payment lower so that I can have some more breathing room month to month, in case of emergencies. Especially since I found out I'll likely be getting laid off in the next 2 months and I wont be eligible for unemployment benefits.

**Here's the current breakdown:**

* Navient (**P**) - $360/mo | $21k (4 separate grad loans @ 6.5-12%)
* Citi (**P**) - $220/mo | $26.9k (3 separate ug loans @ 4-9%)
* Discover (**P**) $360/mo | $36.5k (8 separate ug loans @ 4.5-9%)
* Nelnet (**F**) $200/mo | $35.6k (2 separate ug loans @ 4.25 %)
* AES (**F**) $30/mo | $4.6k (1 ug loan @ 5.25%)
* Total = $1,170/mo | $124.6K ($84.4k P | $40.2k F)

I've been aggressively paying these down over the last few years, always making payments the days the billing cycle opens, and always at least $20 extra per loan. However, the Nelnet and AES balances have barely changed at all that time (about $900 down in 3 years, but that's neither here nor there at this point). *In any case, my goal is to have these loans completely paid off by 2020.*

  

**Personal Finance Summary**

I currently take home about $5k/month as an independent contractor, and immediately transfer 1/4 of each paycheck to savings to cover taxes. I have a separate savings account I also occasionally make deposits to when I have extra cash at the end of the month that I don't put towards my loans. Currently have about $2800 in checking and $4500 in total savings.  Also have credit card debt of about $8k (0% interest balance transfers). Credit score hovering at/above 637.

Any strategies here? Should I consolidate for a longer term, better average rate, and lower monthly payment (enabling me to continue to pay aggressively, but not be on the hook for such a high amount each month if my income drops off)? If so, with whom/how should I pursue consolidation? Should I pay off the credit cards first? I can knock out some of my small loans right now. At this point every $1k of CC debt I knock off will save about $50-100/mo, but $1k of SL debt is only ~$15-30/mo. Or should I just cut back to minimum payments across the board, possibly even pay some months in advance, and save as much as possible in preparation for what could be an indefinite period with no income when I get laid off?  I've even heard it might be a good idea to do a balance transfer of some of my higher interest rate loans to a credit card to effectively lower the monthly payment in the short term to prepare for this.

personalfinance,What factors should I take into account when determining whether or not to refinance?,"My wife and I purchased a duplex for 400k nearly a year ago at an interest rate of 4.5%.  While I know that was a relatively high rate even at that time, it came with near zero closing costs, plus we were in a rush to close the deal to get the house, so we didn't have the luxury to shop around.

This month, I looked into what sort of savings a refinance could offer, and found that we could refinance at 3.75%, which would save us ~$150 per month (afer including insurance and taxes into the quoted estimate).  Also, the mortgage refinance calculators I could find showed that the cost of the refinance should easily pay for itself in about a year (assuming I understood the results correctly, of course).

Am I missing any factors or gotchas that might make refinancing so soon after purchasing the home a bad idea?  We plan to be in the house long-term and have great credit, can't think of any downsides - however, I'm nervous that there may be some compelling factor that I'm not considering here.

personalfinance,Need some quick advice regarding my situation.,"Plain and simple I got kicked out of home because I choose to go to school. I have around 2K in debt with Discover that I can not seem to get rid off, all my other cards are paid off monthly. The discover card is going to be acquiring interest pretty soon. What would be my best bet to get rid of this debt? Discover also offered me a loan at low interest, I thought this would be my best bet right now. Get the loan from Discover, pay off the card which if I'm not mistaken has a 22% interest rate on it and get rid off it and take the hit on a 3K loan from Discover and just pay about 700 plus on the loan.

personalfinance,Advice - using savings/investments to pay rent while I wait on salary bumps,"I could use some advice on how I should go about paying rent outside my means for the next several years as a live off a probationary/incremental salary.  I'm looking forward to PF really tearing me a new one for this but I figured I would ask anyway.


Me:

* 27

* Single

* Washington, D.C./Virginia/Maryland areas


Job:

* Salary starts at $45,000 (~$2,600/month take home)
* Increases by $10-15,000 per year 
* Reaches full performance level at $92,000 in four years (from that point it will increase based on time-in-grade raises)
* Federal job; increases are not contractually guaranteed by are very likely to happen unless I give cause


Assets:

* Brokerage: ~$60,000
* Savings/emergency: ~$10,000
* Retirement: ~$5,500
* Car: ~$5,000 

Expenses:

* $1,200 per month not including rent/utilities.  I can break this out if needed.  

* Looking to spend $1,500-1,900 all included in rent (the point of this post)


Obviously, my salary will not support that rent initially, so I will be digging into investments to the tune of $100-600 dollars per month.  I will also be living at first with more than 50% of take home going to rent, which I realize is not too smart.

My question: Does my plan to pay myself out of savings/investments in order to live more comfortably make sense? Any advice? Should I live more modestly for the first year and then reassess (the downside here being that I would face moving/application fees and a bit of a life shakeup when it is least wanted)?

personalfinance,I am a [19M] college student wondering if my mother's marriage will ruin my financial aid?,"Hey there /r/personalfinance. I'm incredibly grateful for all the help you've been with paying for college as a resource. Now I have a specific question about my situation, and I would appreciate any knowledge or experience you guys can offer. Thanks in advance:

I live with my single mother and younger siblings. The past year was my first at college, and I received about $40,000 in financial aid. I also earned approximately $10,000 in scholarships/grants, leaving me to deal with about $10,000 for the year. I took out government loans, and the remainder was manageable between my mother's $70,000 income (gross) and my savings/Federal work-study.

Now, my mom plans to marry her boyfriend of about 2 years. He has a much higher income than her (at least $200,000). This won't affect my ability to pay tuition, since it's not like he'd pay for my schooling, but I worry how this will change my school's appraisal of my financial situation. Would it be enough for my mom and soon-to-be step-father file taxes separately? What should I do to make sure my financial aid stays about the same? Thank you so much for anything you can contribute, and let me know if you guys need more information.

(Also sorry If this breaks any rules. I've never posted here before.)

Edit: My step-father is a nice guy, but we aren't very close. I've only known him for the past two years, and I've been at an out-of-state college for the past year. Asking him to contribute would be out of the question. 

Also, he currently has to live pretty far away for work (like 5 hours), and he and my mother will likely continue to maintain separate households for at least the next year. Does this make a difference? Thanks again.

Edit 2: For anyone who found this thread and is looking for help, the resounding answer seems to be that the stepparent married to one's *custodial* parent has to be included when filing the FAFSA. I'm going to try talking to my school's financial aid department about my specific situation and see if they can work with me, but there's absolutely no leeway when it comes to filing the FAFSA and government grants/loans.

* I work for the federal government and make approx. $96,000/year. She is a high school teacher and makes approx. $60,000/year. 
* Our combined bi-weekly net salary is roughly $3,900. 
* Combined, we have about $250,000 in savings (actual savings accounts, CDs, mutual funds, etc.). 
* Our monthly expenses are about $700-900, combined.
* My credit score is 826 and hers is in the upper 700s.

Can we realistically afford this house? If not, what general range should we be looking at?

I paid $100 up front, and was told that I would be getting a bill in the mail and a phone call if the initial $100 didn't cover it.

Fast forward to last week, I tried to get a credit card from my credit union (promotional 2.9% introductory for a year, going to 9% after that.) with a limit of $3000 to transfer some balances on old cards with 25% interest rates to so that I can pay them down easier. I was declined. My credit score isn't fantastic due to the aforementioned balances (around $2600, high but nothing insane) but they only needed a score of 650 for the promotional rate and the limit I wanted.

Obviously my first step is calling the collections agency, explaining the situation and setting up a payment plan with them for the minuscule $179 I owe. What do I do after that?

I just started this position last month the position is a long term contract with no foreseeable end date I get PTO and Holiday pay as the only benefits. Healthcare is through parents. 

My current debts are as follows:

$1400 To unemployment for some benefits overpayment shenanigans they pulled on me last year when I was out of work. Minimum payments of $75.00  a month

$3000 For a un-insured accident I had back in 2012 it was a lot more but after $2000  down payment and monthly payments of $150 a month its down to about 3000 left now. I don't know the interest rate off the top of my head. 

I pay $120 a month for my phone bill.

I pay $117  a month for car insurance however my car of two years just died and I salvaged it so still need to turn in tags cancel insurance ect.

Due to constraints of transportation in my area having a car is a must for me to get around and accomplish my day to day responsibility after work. For the past week I have been commuting using the bus too and from work the cost between the train and bus are very close to when I was driving. I take a train to work even when I was driving. 

The car that I had 2 years ago ran me $1800 more like $2400 after legalizing it. I put 30k miles on it before the transmission died. However this time around I am looking to get something to last me a little longer and to re-establish my credit. 

I have the option of a $7000 Camry with low miles excellent condition well maintained clean carfax ect. I have $1600 dollars to put down on it and finance the rest with the help of a family member I was approved for the loan @ 7.3 percent interest at 40 months I believe with the monthly payments being around $190 a month. The agreement I had with my family member was to give them $1000 a month towards the car to pay it ASAP and to control my spending ect.

I have wa friend selling my a civic he got from and auction for around $3500 however I am not looking into getting another cheap car that I have to keep putting money into to repair ect.  

My issues with my poor spending that I have noticed is I eat out almost all meals of the day this hurts my waistline and my pocket as well as the crap ton of money I have invested in my gaming P.C which I am taking a break from as there is no need to spend more. I am asking for advice on how to deal with these debts as well as this vehicle I am planning on purchasing and having money saved to pay my first semester out of pocket as I don't qualify for fasfa due to my parents for 4 classes it is roughly $2000.

personalfinance,Help! In-laws are pressuring us to buy their house even though we already own and just had a baby.,"My wife and I have been married for a year, lived together in our own home for 2+ and just brought home our first baby. Before we even got out of the hospital, my mother-in-law started asking us to buy her house.

Shotgun blast of hopefully relevant information:

My mother-in-law is two years from retirement and wants to move in to an apartment at a retirement community immediately. Like, preferably before she even retires. MIL and her already-retired husband want us to ""take over"" their mortgage to accomplish this.

We at least all realize that we don't know anything about assuming a mortgage and that some solid legal counsel will be needed on both sides of the transaction. My in-laws have not asked for, and my wife and I will not accept, anything less than a formal agreement. No handshake deals or ""mutual understandings"". And nothing drafted by the parties, either.

In-laws bought their house in, if I recall, 2008 after getting fed up with several years of bad experiences with landlords. It is a nice place, and they've kept it well, although they haven't really added any value to it. Their house is in a suburban area near a small city about an hour from where my family now lives.

I bought a house in the rural area where I work years before meeting my wife and, unfortunately, it is quite a way from her work. The in-laws place is about a 10 minute commute for her, while our place is almost an hour.

I don't know how reliable this is, but I looked up the in-laws house on Zillow, and it appears that it was listed at $119,900 at the beginning of 2008, was taken off the market, then purchased by my in-laws late that year for $122,500. (Could they actually have paid OVER the last asking price?)

From their county RPTS site, they pay approximately (working from memory here) $5,000 a year in combined taxes. I don't know what their utilities and other expenses are, but they are perfectly willing to give us detailed information on that. I doubt it could be any less than our current expenses.

I also don't know particulars of the mortgage, but MIL told me that there's about $101,000 outstanding and they currently pay about $1,100 per month inclusive of taxes and homeowners' insurance into escrow.

I bought my house in 2005 for $60,000. I ""refinanced"" 3 years ago via a promissory note with my own parents. There's about $20,000 left on the note to be paid over the next 12 years. I also put another approximately $50,000 into the house since purchase, all of which was paid for as savings for the purpose allowed. Our monthly payment to my parents is $300.

Our taxes are about $3,000 per year combined and our utilities are another $3,000-4,000, depending on the price of heating gas in the winter. (I should've mentioned that we are all situated in central New York State.)

We have a household income of about $90,000 pre-tax. Our savings are pitiably low right now, what with baby stuff to buy and hospital bills (our son was very pre-term and we were in the NICU with him for over three months--we've got really quite good insurance, but even so...). We will need a new vehicle within a year as we must replace my pickup with something more baby- and gas-friendly.

The area we're in now is small and has low housing turnover--people tend to buy a house and raise a family; there isn't much moving in and out or around within the community. I've been a long time and feel quite confident that it would take a couple of years to sell our place. While it's a nice little home, I think that it would suffer in comparison to others available, even to those looking for starter homes.

The one plus for our house is that we get a bustling summer tourist influx and for about 16 weeks in the summer it's possible we could rent the house by the week for somewhere in the range of $1,000-$1,500 per week. We'd have to clean the place or hire a cleaner and we'd use a booking agent who would take a percentage. But if we just shuttered the place in the winter, it might be that our current property could at least be a net-zero cost until we can sell.

There are some intangibles here, and unfortunately they compete. My wife is tiring of her commute. Her job can be stressful and I'd like to lessen her load, what with a new baby and all. She also is the higher earner, has the good health insurance and there are no decent alternatives for her line of work more convenient to our current whereabouts (believe me, we've been looking and networking around here ever since she moved in and she realized, yes, it's a long commute, especially in January in the Northeast). Plus, she has student loans of over $200,000 that will be forgiven if she completes another seven years with her current employer. To say nothing of gas and wear-and-tear on her vehicle.

My concerns are totally selfish and I have already conceded that they don't outweigh the above. I just fucking hate the suburbs. I like my little house with a patch of land and only a couple of close neighbors. We've got chickens and dogs and cats. My commute is about 5 minutes. My work schedule, however, is more flexible than hers and I can even arrange a work-from-home for some of it. I might only have to make the trip three times a week if we moved.

How do I calculate whether this makes financial sense? What questions should I ask of her parents and of our lawyer? Any thoughts on assumption of an exisiting mortgage? It feels like it could be full of pitfalls for the un-savvy. We don't have the means to refinance and by the place outright and the MIL's big selling point is that we could just ""take over"" her place without needing a 20% down payment.

I'm not sure what else may be helpful in giving advice, but will surely add anything that PF thinks is necessary.

Also, general retirement planning question: I've always been given to understand that it is inadvisable to take on large debts, such as a mortgage for a primary home, as one approaches retirement. For my own family's planning purposes, what's the conventional wisdom on this? I'd like to avoid the situation that my in-laws find themselves in.",finance,1431341490
Forex,NFP Data Didn’t Come Out As Expected,"On Friday, last week Non-farm payroll data was released. A total of 223K jobs were added in the US economy in the month of April. The released number was close to the expected number of jobs of 224K but we would agree to the fact that this is a very improved labor market situation since only 85K jobs were created in the US economy in the month of March. Another data was unemployment rate, which was also released at the same time with the NFP.

Traders seemed confused over this confusing data release so does the market. Market rallied by 70 pips initially and then later erased all those gains and had plunged by 40 pips and again rose up. In short, market was being indecisive but highly volatile as anyone would expect during the release of NFP. But later, EURUSD move further downside.

Today on Monday, EURUSD has been sliding downwards since the market’s opening. Technically, immediate support can be found around 1.1065 whilst the immediate resistance can be found around 1.1285. While EURUSD remained indecisive during the last Friday, the Great Britain Pound had a solid gain against the greenback. GBPUSD was able to break above the previous resistance of 1.5495 level but was unable to close above it. The Immediate resistance for the GBPUSD is the Friday’s swing high. And the immediate support for the pair is the low of Friday around 1.5355.

To highlight the major economic events this week, we have BOE asset purchase facility report today along with BOE’s interest rate decision. On Tuesday we have NIESR GDP estimate report, which is also expected to move the market. On Wednesday we have Germany’s GDP report, CPI report coming out.

I've been a lurker for a long time, I learned some things in here and generally learned how to live below my means as a student but I never had any serious bills or loans to pay off before.

I got my father's life insurance benefits paid today (around 19,500€) after he passed away a month ago.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing questions,"Hey /r/personalfinance,

I currently have ~87k in student loan debt all through the federal government/nelnet. Average interest rate is 6.2%. I'm going into medical residency so my expected gross income for the next 3 years is &lt;60k/year, but after that average salary for my specialty goes up to ~250k. 

I've looked at the options for public service loan forgiveness (which is less likely because my chosen specialty is mostly employed by private groups that staff hospitals rather than non profit hospitals themselves) , the government backed loan forgiveness, and other options that I have if I keep the federal loans. The problem is that all of the nelnet and federal estimators, even with income based repayment, have me repaying my loans after 8 years max, making the minimum payment. So I'm not sure if I'll ever even reach these benefits. 

I currently have a pending deal with DRB to get my rate down to 4.5% or 4.75% (depending on whether or not I open an accoun with them) over a 10 year loan with numerous benefits of it's own. Primarily, my minimum payment while in training would be $100/month. I fully intend to pay more than that, but this does help my limited salary. So my questions to /r/personalfinance:

1: Does anyone have experience with DRB? Any issues or concerns with the company that I might need to know about?

2: Any advice on refinancing vs keeping my federal loans given my current borrowed total and potential repayment options?

Thanks for the help!

financialindependence,Justifying a higher withdrawal rate in the 8% - 10% range. Am I crazy?,"Here's the scenario:

M/28 and I've been working my butt off in the finance industry since I graduated college in 2009. A lot of my 20s have passed before my eyes while I've been stuck in a cube. On the plus side, I've managed to save a good chunk of money. I'm finishing up a 2-year contract with my current employer in a few months and I'm considering a mini retirement. For the sake of round numbers, let's say I'm expecting to have about $200k when I leave.

I want to spend some time doing some things that I've been putting off due to my time demanding work - fitness, hiking, reading, seeing family/friends, travel, etc. I plan to do some independent consulting from home part time to help pay the bills, but I honestly have no idea how much money this will bring in. I've done a bit of this consulting while I've been in my current job as a side-hustle and I can typically get $50-$100/hr but the # of hours I am able to get vary widely. 

I'm trying to convince myself that I can get by on only the income from my $200k invested. This will give me the reassurance to take that next step and work as an independent consultant without a guaranteed paycheck twice a month. Otherwise I have trouble making the leap. I know I can't live off $8k/yr (4% withdrawal rate). I can live off of $16-$20/yr (8%-10% withdrawal rate). Here's how I'm justifying the 8%-10%:

- I don't need the 4% to cover me indefinitely. 
- I expect to bring in some money through consulting, but I have no clue how much. I wouldn't know where to begin to estimate this number (which is why I'm going through this exercise)
- About 20% of my $200k will be in Lending Club. My return so far on Lending Club has been great about about 11% net of all defaults, etc. I find this bullet particularly interesting. What are some of the arguments against putting 50%+ of my portfolio in here? The anticipated default rate returns incorporates the great recession, so even if another recession hit, the projected 11% return should hold true unless some other outside event causes a drop greater than the last recession. If anything, this rate may go up if interest rates rise in the coming years (as most people expect they will). I know there is risk as a whole that something happens to the Lending Club company and somehow none of the investors get their $ back, but what is the real risk of this? I view it as &lt;1%.

Sorry for the long back story, but what are this sub's thoughts on this higher withdrawal rate? I realize I'm trying to rationalize this, but it gives me the security I need to take the leap into self employment and mini-retirement. The Lending Club point above could also help justify higher withdrawal rates for those that wish to retire indefinitely, instead of my unique scenario with this mini retirement.",finance,1431361327
personalfinance,SO's mother received a large inheritance sum. I have a partial plan and I really could use some feedback and further suggestions.,"I am posting this on a throwaway for privacy and security reasons. The situation we are in is somewhat simple yet somewhat specific. We all would greatly appreciate any advice and feedback you have about this. Thank you in advance!
  
My SO's mother inherited at least $250,000. Since she has no outstanding debt, ours and the mother's first priority is for the mother to get a divorce, which the father may or may not contest. This reason the divorce is priority is for personal and sensitive reasons. I'm merely mentioning the divorce so that any costs, if any at all, could be factored into the financial plan. According to our state law, inheritance money is non-marital so he shouldn't be able to receive any part of the money during the divorce since only the mother was named the recipient of the inheritance (If I am wrong, please correct me). I don't anticipate on the divorce being costly for the mother since she has grounds for divorce which can be testified by many others, including her children. She also doesn't have any personal estate that we need to worry about (no car, no house, no other money, literally nothing). The father also doesn't have any personal estate
  
With that aside, I'll get to the plan I am considering and would greatly appreciate your assistance:  
  
* The mother has a 16 year old who wants to go to college. We feel that this inheritance opened the door for better education opportunities for the 16 year old outside of community college. I feel that if we invest $50,000 in a short term, high growth account, there is a possibility the amount could increase and the child can either use the growth income (correct term?) for expenses in school or for tuition. I also know there is a risk that we could lose money this way. The child will also be able to apply for a FASFA and other forms of financial aid since inheritance doesn't count as income and the mother has little to no income currently. I really don't think the 16 year old is interested in anything beyond a bachelors degree nor will they be going to a super expensive college. With that in mind, is $50,000 a good amount for a 4 year college fund? And what type of investment should do you feel is best for this?  
  
* Another concern is that the mother has zero working experience. It's a long story, please don't ask. She is definitely able to work, however she will probably not be able to get a job where she could afford rent or a mortgage on that income alone. That is why I am thinking that a good portion of the remaining money needs to go into some investment account which she could use the interest (or growth income? terminology?) to assist her with paying the bills. I do not know how much to allocate or what type of investing to go with. But given her circumstances, I feel that a ""safe"" low-risk investment is better since she can't really afford to lose any of that money. What are your thoughts? How much should go into this and what would be best? 
  
* Since neither the mother nor father have a house, I don't see an apartment as being the best choice for the mother in the long run. My SO and I feel that some of the inheritance should go into a down payment on a house for obvious reasons: a chance for the housing market to appreciate, a stable place for her and her 16 year old to live in, the means to place a larger down payment on the house means lower monthly payments and finally, something she can leave her children when she passes. If you feel this is a good idea, how much should go towards this? The housing market in our area runs from $180,000 - $250,000 for a house that would suit her needs. I should also mention that the mother may have bad credit (we're going to check this asap) so she may not get the best interest rate on a loan. She definitely isn't going to have good credit though
  
* Given what I said earlier about the mother having absolutely no estate or work experience, this means she has no retirement funds. I often see high praise about putting money into a Vanguard for this. My question is, since the mother is in her 50's and given our other concerns, how much should we put into the Vanguard (or other recommendations for retirement plans)?  
  
**So in summary:**  
  
Out of $250,000:  
  
1. How much should go into the 16 year old's college fund and what should we invest it in?  
2. How much and what should we invest in for the mother to have some extra stable income to pay the bills  
3. Is a down payment on a house worthwhile? If so, how much?  
4. How much should we invest into a Vanguard (or another retirement fund) if at all?  
  
Once again, thank you so much for any time and consideration. Your advice will be extremely invaluable. As with a lot of people who post on here, we've never dealt with this much money before and I'm trying very hard to make the best decisions.",finance,1431363425
personalfinance,(CAN) Balancing medical school and life.,"Hi Personal Finance,

I have casually browsed this subreddit for over a year now and it seems that people here are very helpful and knowledgeable. This post will likely be on-going and edited as I find out more. My hope is that the fine people of PF will be able to shed some light on other options as well as sharing their experiences. 

So here's the situation:

1. I was recently accepted into medical school. Tuition is approximately $20 000 CAD/year for 4 years.
2. I am in a long-term relationship (Just celebrated 5 years) and I want to get married/move out within the next two years. According to some sources, weddings cost an average of $20 000-$30 000. Due to the fact that I will likely have a Chinese wedding, It is likely that some of the costs will be recouped in gifts (Money is one of the most common gifts, to my understanding).
3. I currently live in the metro-Vancouver area and housing is EXPENSIVE (Average house is ~$1Mill CAD). I do want to work and live here in the future, after graduating.
4. I currently have zero debt from completing my undergraduate degree.

Regarding the financial aid, here's the information I have:

1. I am an instructor as an exam-prep company; I teach 4 or 5 courses a year and get paid $1000~$1300 CAD per course (Total is about $5 000 ~ $6 000 CAD)
2. Student loans can provide about $12 000 CAD/year towards tuition. To my understanding, it is interest free for 500 weeks for medical students. 
3. Banks pre-approve medical students a loan of ~$250 000 CAD with a 'low interest rate' (I have yet to meet with a financial adviser at the bank). They also allow repayment of just the interest until I finish school.
4. My girlfriend has offered to help pay for school, she makes $65 000 CAD/year before taxes
5. I have yet to talk to my parents about finances, but I think they are willing to help if I need it (But they are by no means well-off).

That's what I know thus far. I will edit throughout the week and probably throughout the next couple of months, as I try and work it all out. Any and all advice is welcome. Thanks!",finance,1431363813
personalfinance,Girlfriend apprehensive to pay off $50k loan debt because she thinks future legislation will ease debt burden,"Hi guys,

My girlfriend is $50k in debt at a 6.8% federal loan. She currently makes about $75k a year, and has around $2k in monthly expenses. I advised her that she should pay off as much as she can monthly to get rid of her loans, but she says she's worried that by time she pays it off down the road there will be legislation that will ease the debt burden since it's such a national crisis at this point. She's a big saver and would rather save up so we can put a downpayment on a home.

A part of me agrees with her, but I also don't think it would be wise to gamble on Washington. I was also thinking perhaps if she agrees to pay the loan off quickly that she could negotiate a better rate or something like that, but I am not sure. 

What are your thoughts on the matter? Am I wrong in telling her she should just rid of it ASAP?

personalfinance,Major One-Time Retirement Decision – Help Needed,"I work in a large practice group. I’m in my mid-30s [M], married with kids. Work is giving me a one-time decision to opt-in to a retirement package. This decision will last the entirety of my career with the group. The plan is comprised of the following:

1. 401(k) / Roth 401(k) plan as usual: I will be able to adjust these as I see fit throughout the years, as well as self-manage. There is no company match.

2. KEOGH plan = roughly $25k/yr. This contribution is set in stone annually. I won’t be able to adjust it. I will be able to manage this money similar to a 401k plan. No company match.

3. Cash Balance Plan = roughly $50/yr. This contribution is also set in stone. These contributions are scheduled to rise each year from the current $50k all the way to $200k by the time I’m nearing retirement. The goal is to provide a sizable annuity at the end of my career. These funds are completely managed by a third-party. In addition to the annual contributions, a small amount of interest will be credited each year (usually around 5%). Funds are managed to reduce volatility for the sake of the entire fund (similar to a pension plan). No company match.

I currently have approximately $200k in a 401k. My expenses are high and will remain high throughout my career and I suspect into retirement. Savings and other taxable investments are healthy.

As I see it, here are the Pros to opting-in:

1)	Tax Savings. The main benefit to these types of plans (as far as I can tell) is that they have a huge impact on taxable income. We’re talking about annual contributions of $100,000 (to start with) vs. $18,000 in a 401k. 

2)	Near-complete peace of mind regarding retirement. The practice group is very successful and I don’t foresee the cash balance annuity ever being in jeopardy.

The Cons:

1)	Huge amount of money out of my paycheck. I do well, but this will still be a major hit toward my financial flexibility in the present.

2)	No ability to make a different decision in the future if my financial situation changes for the worse.

3)	The Cash Balance plan is basically forced savings. I’m not especially moved by such a large chunk of change being relegated to a 5% interest rate.

The big question mark for me is the tax savings. I’m in the highest federal tax bracket currently (and have about a 41% effective rate). The thing is, with my expenses and the annuity payouts, I expect to be in roughly the same tax bracket (or close) in retirement as well. So I don’t really know how much the tax savings matter now. Wouldn’t I be better off putting that money in a taxable account, aiming to draw down the money at a 15-20% cap gains rate (or whatever it ends up being) in retirement?",finance,1431365555

I am familiar with the concepts of emergency funds and contributing to employer matched retirement plans, etc. This is more specific than just following basic sound advice for handling money.

Because I have not held a job at a participating entity for the past 5 years (I switched to the private sector), the money I previously contributed to a state-run retirement pension is about to be refunded to me. After federal income taxes are withheld, I'll have about $13,000 to use.

Our home mortgage has a variable rate and I want to refinance to a 30 yr fixed in the near future before rates start climbing much further. So I'm trying to decide whether I would get more bang for my buck in the refinance process from having an additional $13,000 of equity in my house via applying this towards the balance on my HELOC, or whether the smarter play is to pay off a couple high interest CCs (or more accurately, pay off one and pay off a majority of a second).


The specs:


-$175,000 primary mortgage, variable rate, currently around 4%

-$33,500 HELOC at 6.5%

-$8,174 CC at 18.99%

-$8,767 CC at 15.24%

-$4,865 CC at 9.69%


So the options are:


1) Roll $13,000 into an IRA that doesn't help me with my refinance or my too-high credit card debt

2) Put $13,000 towards the HELOC, gaining equity but leaving myself with lots of high interest CC debt

3) Put all $13,000 towards the high interest CC debt, leaving myself with ~$3,900 at 15.24% and ~$4,800 at 9.69%.

Both options 2 and 3 will improve my FICO score and should help get me a lower rate on the primary mortgage.

My balance is currently around $45,000 (roughly $30,000 in federal loans and $15,000 in private). Her remaining balance is around $60,000.

We started out doing a 10-year standard repayment, and then switched to IBR when we had kids and our monthly expenses increased due to daycare tuition. As a teacher, my wife will be eligible for PSLF loan forgiveness in a few years. Now that our month-to-month budget strain has eased up a bit, we were considering moving me back to the standard repayment plan to pay down the loans a bit faster. (I have about 5.5 years to go if I stick with IBR and my income remains reasonably steady, while I’d have it paid off in about 3.5 years under a standard plan).

If I switch back to a standard repayment, is that taken into consideration in calculating my wife’s monthly IBR payment? In other words, it’s my understanding that our payments are capped at 15% of household discretionary income. Can we effectively pay down my loans faster while reducing the payments on her loans since her loans are going to be eligible for forgiveness in a few years?

Savings: 1500

Credit card debt: 1700 (no interest till August) planning on paying this off first.

The remaining is after taxes and it's worth mentioning that I am contributing 6% to a 401k that has an employer match. A few of my concerns are that once I finish school and owe 30k that my minimum payments will be more than what I make. I currently owe 17k on my car and I would like to pay this off in two years (I was dumb and purchased it when I had a higher income) the car is now valued at 12k although it's my last car purchase until it dies.

My thoughts are to put 350 of the Remaining money into savings and start building the emergency fund. In a different conversation here someone mentioned https://www.bcu.org/Products/Banking/Savings/Rainy-Day-Savings for the emergency fund since they offer a decent interest rate for savings and I could still withdraw money if it was critical.

personalfinance,Want to consider my options regarding how to best pay off credit card debt aggressively.,"**tl;dr:** Should I look into a loan for refinancing our debt, or just stay the course? Reviewed the FAQ, but I haven't seen much about loans for refinancing.

Currently, we have two cards with $9.5k debt in total ($5.6k at 14.24% APR, and $3.9k at 19.99% APR). Some may think this is a lot, some may think it's not that bad. Considering we just flushed away $150+ last month on interest, I'd say it's far too much. Our goals are two-fold: to pay off this debt and to be in a position to start house-hunting by the end of 2016, if possible.

Additionally: I was just approved last week for an AmEx card with a $10k limit, because I was encouraged by coworkers to start reaping travel rewards. I plan on using this card properly, only charging to it (a) what I know I can pay off in full by the time the bill is due thanks to a strict budget, and (b) work travel expenses that my job will reimburse me for, usually within 10-14 days of making a claim. According to what I understand about credit, this will hopefully raise my credit score somewhat, as my credit utilization percentage will have dropped significantly.  My score was in the 690-700 range before the new card, and as of January, I'm up to a $65k salary at my first 'real' job. I have already received fantastic feedback, so I'm not worried about being unemployed anytime soon.

Basically, I'm considering a couple options now to address the first two cards' balances:

1. Stay the course, paying what we can, focusing on the card with the higher APR to help minimize interest payments. It looks like this will total nearly $1k per month, but it's kind of taking a toll on our daily stress levels. Fortunately, my wife's new part-time job might bump this figure up even higher.

2. Taking out a personal loan with LendingClub (which I heard about on reddit) or Upstart (which I saw on CreditKarma), in the hopes of minimizing our interest rate. It would also reset the two cards we have to a zero balance, so they are no longer toxic and we could start using them for daily expenses and rewards (according to a budget, charging only what we can budget for).

I guess there's also the prospect of biting the bullet and trying to open a balance transfer card, but to have two new cards opened in rapid succession seems inherently more risky towards my credit score.

I'm starting to seriously consider option 2, because it may help our credit, and it may help us in case emergencies come up to have a lower minimum payment. (I'd want to make sure we don't end up in a situation where there's a prepayment penalty, though.) However, I don't want it to adversely affect our credit scores, either, considering we're hoping to start the house-hunting process in 12-18 months. (That's a whole 'nother can of worms that I won't try to open here.)

No matter what advice I get here, I am going to continue to do my research and probably not take any action until the end of the month, because this it obviously a huge move with a lot of potential impact.",finance,1431379066
personalfinance,Looking for finance/career/schooling advice,"To start off with some context lets do a rundown on what I have so far:
I live in Canada - 28 y/o male working for the railway making between 65,000 and 80,000 a year for the last 7 years. Of that time I have had to take off approx a combined 1 years due to medical reasons and the first couple years are basically gaining seniority and laid off most of the time. I would save I have had a solid 4 years working steadily. During this time I have had training for a promotion from a conductor to a Locomotive Engineer. I am expected to make around 75,000 - 80,000 this year.

I do not own my own home, as I have been working out of town and have moved 3 times in the last 4 years. I pay $950 rent and live in a basement suite with my girlfriend of 4 years. $950 rent includes everything. I own my own truck, fully paid for with insurance costing $170 a month.
My girlfriend makes 30,000 a year working for her family business. We keep our finances separate however I pay all the bills, cellphones ($200 combined) rent ($950) car insurance ($170) and food. She gives me $800 a month to pay for all expenses.

I have $38,000 in stock matched shares with my company sitting in a reserve fund which I have been contributing to for 4 years. My stocks trend is upwards as they always are with the railway because of a recent split 2 years ago which put the stocks at an extremely low price. Although they have recently went down ~$5 a share - this obviously isn't the time to sell as I am down ~4,000 from a few months back (but no sweat as they always go back up) I also have a retirement/pension plan at work with ~$40k in it

I have ~8,000 in debt from small loan I have which I am paying off steadily. The interest rate for it is ~5.89% and I am on a payment plan of $250 a month. I have 7k in credit card debt from work expenses (i pay upfront and repaid after being submitted/approved by supervisor) which will be cleared off shortly.
I have 3k in my savings account and another 3k in my regular account as a small backup and another 600 in an account with another bank that I don't touch and will not touch unless absolute dire straights - all expenses and bills are up to date. My girlfriend has 5k in savings. I have been putting most of my money into the stock/share program at work, including my 2 bonuses over the last 4 years. I have excellent credit not a single blemish.

Now comes the tricky part, I am unhappy with my job and the amount of travel/sleepless nights and the list goes on (as anyone who has a railroading background will understand) I want to go back to school and possibly get a trades degree. The diploma is 2 years. After my diploma I will make around 50,000 the first couple years and it will quickly shoot up to exactly what I have been making currently. I am so unsure if its a good idea to re-take schooling at my age. I have been seriously looking to buy a home lately but obviously if I start a new career I would be investing the money I have for a down payment into schooling. My schooling tuition would be $6000 at BCIT.

personalfinance,Parent bailed on tuition. Too late for FAFSA and don't want to defer for a year.,"Hi, I just finished my first year of a graduate program at a prestigious university on the East Coast. Next year was supposed to be my second and final year. My father had a great job and was generous enough to pay for my undergraduate and graduate tuition with cash. Living expenses and rent are also paid for. 

Unfortunately, work visa issues have left him without a pay check for a while. I am a little fuzzy on the details as he is not forthcoming but essentially I was told I would have to figure out next years tuition with loans. Rent would still be paid for. I didn't ask about other living expenses. He also said that he would pay the loans back for me once his job got sorted but obviously I wont count on this. My philosophy in life tends to be expect the worst, hope for the best. 

Now my problem is that i was told AFTER the FAFSA deadline. I didn't apply for FAFSA because I never needed to. Does this mean that I cannot get any federally subsidized student loans? Can I get private student loans just by going to a bank even if I don't have a job? Lastly, I was accepted into a summer program that costs $4,000 and the tuition for that is due on the 15th of this month. Is it possible to get a loan before then? I know loans are something that millions of college and graduate students deal with on a regular basis, I guess I just feel really scared right now because I wasn't prepared.

I currently have a Discover card which I signed up for via mail ~10 months ago. I have made my payments by auto draft every month and never missed a payment. The card is alright in my opinion.

investing,How to tell whether the structured settlement buyer you’re dealing with is genuine?,"The annuity that you are receiving as a part of your structured settlement due to some personal injury or as a part of your worker’s compensation may just not work out if you have a sudden need to make some lump sum payments. It could be to make some urgent payments that need to be made otherwise there could be legal penalties or to pay for education or health related issues or to make any other equally important payments that needs a substantial amount- one that you cannot generate from any other avenue. Although the amount that you are receiving as your settlement would normally have been sufficient to cover the expense but because the settlement is being awarded to you structurally in parts as monthly or annual installments, it is difficult to get your hands on to a larger sum of money that you need now. This may just make you make up your mind to sell your structured settlement to another buyer who will in lieu of the settlement amount give you your desired huge amount in one go.

You must check the buyer before agreeing to sell your structured settlement

To ascertain that the settlement buyer that you are dealing with is genuine is difficult but not altogether impossible. It does require to you to file the required papers in the court before you seek to sell your structured settlements. The court will then set a date for you when you will have to appear and you can have an attorney represent you the expenses of which are generally borne by the buying party. You may even have your private attorney alternatively. If the buyer discourages you to have your personal attorney then it is a clear cut signal for you to be worried. Also, the role of the broker’s in getting your structured settlements being sold cannot be neglected. These people have the best of your interests in their hearts and it could be a part of their jobs to look into the profile of perspective buyers who wish to buy your structured settlements as to their credibility and capacity to provide you with the lump sum payments that you need. However, you may use the services of brokers only when there are huge sums involved because even their services come with a price tag. But if you employ their services they are able to get you the best buyers who will pay you a good amount for the sale of your structured settlements and will also take care of all the legal formalities in a way that there can be no way in which the other party can cheat you with your money. Ask for the quote of their services before you commit them to your case.

Few things to know before selling your structured settlements

Normally before the person or company buying your structured settlement offers you any advance against your structured settlement, should you opt to sell it to them; the brokers provide you with ready cash which can get you started in making the pressing payments for which you were selling the settlements in the first place. This also is a part of the services of the brokers and one that they are earnest enough to perform. The skilled representatives of the brokers leave no stone unturned in getting you the best rates from a reliable buying company in no time at all. It is however understood that the amount you will be receiving from the buyer will be lesser than the total value of your structured settlements, all installments put together but this the price that you pay to help yourself in dire circumstances by getting a discounted price for your settlements by selling it to another buyer. The consent of the judge in the legal court is mandatory for such dealings to take place; you will have to cite your reasons before him for selling your structured settlements prematurely. But if you have made sure that the buyers are genuine, you should have no cause for worry while selling the structured settlements yet in any case having a tight proof case with full transparency is best advised so that you are secured legally to receive all the payments that you must receive after selling your structured settlements. The brokers again play a vital role in this regard because their work is not done until you receive the full payment as you were promised.

The conduct of the buyer is proof enough

The amount given to you as decided is dependent on some factors. You may choose to sell full or half of your structured settlements. It is also subjective to the current economic conditions and may have certain additional extras added on to them. The company willing to award you all the money as their prerogative in the most transparent way would most likely be your true savior. As per Richard from (company name), structured settlements should only be sold to credible buyers with good intentions. You may be assisted by brokers during the sale to guide you through the legal proceedings and it is imperative too because the federal law can have an imposition of a 40% excise tax on transactions which are not in accordance with the ‘qualified state statute’ and hence before proceeding any further with the plan, you should ascertain in all ways explained earlier the genuineness of the buyer whom you are selling your structured settlement to.",finance,1431407319
personalfinance,Crazy/Stupid situation with ReFi/Escrow. Advice? (x-post r/mortgages),"So I'm in a situation where I'm just not sure what to do. . .
Bought a house 2 years ago at 3.75% with an FHA loan. Payments started out just fine at $1500/mo, then dropped to $1400/mo after an Escrow adjustment.

Last month I had another Escrow adjustment that jumped me up to $1750/mo due to an increase in Escrow - caused by a shortage from last year and a normal increase from this year both due to property taxes increasing with the value of the house. That $1750 amount hurts, as I've gotten a divorce since then and am running a little tight already due to medical bills and a decrease in what I'm getting from the ex-wife (the ex thing is complicated, but the house is completely mine and she is contributing nominally to expenses as she tries to buy her own house).

So I'm looking into a Refi which seems like it shouldn't work or it should be stupid. . .

There is a slight chance that I'd be able to refi at the same 3.75%, but 3.875 seems more likely. I can't afford the closing costs, so that would be rolled back into the loan. Obviously the property value has gone up, so I'm below the 20% threshold to avoid PMI.

Essentially I'd be adding ~2years and ~4-6 thousand dollars to the loan itself to lower my payments back down to around $1400/month. The savings would be getting out of FHA Mortgage Insurance and resetting the escrow to remove the shortage that I'm paying (though I'm assuming that is getting rolled into that 4-6k increase in the total loan amount).

How crazy or stupid is this decision? It seems like it should be crazy or stupid. You are supposed to refi to get a lower rate, not a higher one and just to lower escrow payments. But I know that if I don't do something about that escrow now, it's gonna go up again next year, which will be REALLY painful at that point. Interest rates certainly aren't going to be down at this level again anytime soon.

I don't incur any out of pocket costs until the appraisal comes around, which is next Monday.

Do I need to talk myself out of this and find some other way to handle the escrow? If so, what do you suggest? From what I understand, Wells Fargo refuses to do escrow adjustments outside of their regular annual one, so anything I do will take until next year to take effect.",finance,1431409167

I have around 35k in student loans. My credit is pretty great but my current interest is 3.12%.

It used to be under 2% but Navient bought my loans from Chela and then they raised the interest which I think is pretty shitty since I had worked so hard to find good interest rates and consolidate back in 2008.

Does anyone know if it would be worth it to refinance to try to get a lower interest rate? Or is 3.12% about the best I can do?

If so, anyone have any suggestions for which company might be able to get a lower rate? Any other ideas for avoiding that 3.12%?",finance,1431414035
Banking,"China stocks jump, property shares rally after rate cut","May 11 Chinese stocks jumped about 3 percent in volatile trading on Monday, led by property and infrastructure shares, after the central bank cut interest rates for the third time in six months to shore up the world's second biggest economy.

While the reduction in benchmark lending and deposit rates by the People's Bank of China over the weekend came as no major surprise, the move gave investors an excuse to pick up stock after the market slumped to its biggest decline in nearly 5 years last week.

""We still stick to our view that the market is in an upward trend, despite increasing volatility,"" said Li Haoshu, strategist at Chuangcai Securities Co.

The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen rose 2.9 percent, to 4,690.53, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 3.05 percent, to 4,333.58 points.

Real estate and infrastructure stocks gained as investors bet the sector would benefit from lower borrowing costs.

The start-up board ChiNext surged 5.6 percent to a fresh record, spurred by hopes the tech-heavy index would benefit from Beijing's economic restructuring efforts. (Reporting by Samuel Shen and Kazunori Takada; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)

Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen

1 It’s always a challenge for an ophthalmologist, an eye surgeon, to address an audience like this, who knows far more than me about financial services and financial institutions.

2 Mr Stephen Aguilar-Milan is a futurist with the World Futures Society, and he has a hypothesis that every 50 years or so, there is a major technological wave. My hypothesis is that every time there is major technological wave, you have a period of intense disruption, a period of increased opportunities, a period of great inequality and robber barons, and it takes some time before the middle class adopts the same technologies and creates more wide spread prosperity. My thesis tonight is that we are in the midst of such a wave.

3 So let’s start with Stephen’s hypothesis. If you go back to 1770 in England, the time of mills and canals – the canals that you can still see in London and England – that was the start of cottage industries, of early industrialisation in England. The fact that it happened in England gave it a head-start in the Industrial Revolution.

4 You move forward another 40 or 50 years from there, you get to the early 1800s. The pivotal invention then was the steam engine, and with the steam engine came railways and railroads, and many fortunes were made by the successive rollout of railways in England, Europe and America.

5 Fast forward another 50 years to about 1870 – that was the age of steel, electricity and heavy engineering. That was also the age of large ocean-going ships, warfare, refrigeration and trade opened up on an industrial scale.

6 The 4th wave began sometime around 1910. That was really about oil, and oil opened up the possibility of the automobile, and especially in America, the age of the car, interstate highways, and the long American love affair with the car and all that it represents in popular culture.

7 If you stop to think about these waves, and think about some names associated with these waves – if you go back to 1910 and think about oil, what names come to mind? For instance, Rockefeller – that was how huge fortunes were made. If you go further back to the age of steel, the American name that comes to mind is Carnegie, and related to that, Mellon, the bank. And if you go back to the age of the steam engine and railways, there are pantheons of tycoons, technologists and early-adopters who made huge fortunes because suddenly, everything changed, and there was a period of big disruption - old industries were gutted, and new industries were made. The people who got in first made huge fortunes.

8 Now let’s move forward to the 5th wave. You can roughly date the 5th wave to the late 1940s, after the Second World War, in particular the invention of the transistor, which replaced the old vacuum tubes. By accident or design, this started off in Silicon Valley. I think it was William Shockley who moved back to Palo Alto from New York, because he had an ageing mother in Palo Alto. At the same time, Stanford University was also trying to find and define an opportunity for commercialising its academic pursuits, and finding daily relevance for the discoveries in the labs and the work that its professors did. The transistor in turn led to an explosion of electronics, and in a later wave, electronics in turn led to computers and much of what we know of modern electronics today. So starting from the transistor in 1947, we move all the way to today.

9 If you believe this theory of 50 years, we are clearly past 50 years. This is where I will take a risk, and posit that there is a 6th wave. The difference in technological waves is that they don’t come and go; each wave builds successively on preceding waves, and this 6th wave is actually about connectivity - meaning that the transistor led to the CPU, which led to the computer and now it is about the Internet, the World Wide Web, big data analytics, the Internet of Things, and telecommunications. We are moving beyond hardware to bits and ideas, and we are now living in a world which is far more densely connected than ever before.

10 Today, a lot of the political polemic is about inequality. My favourite theory is that inequality is not the result of a covert right wing conspiracy, but really just another episode of the fact that there is a major tectonic technological wave sweeping through our society, and the people who get it, the few people who understand and are first able to capitalise, will make fortunes as large, in historical terms, as the Rockefellers, the Carnegies and the rest. So it’s no accident today that the names you hear about, whether it’s Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Carlos Slim in Mexico, Jack Ma of Alibaba, are all people who are early riders of this emerging wave. The point I want to make, therefore, is that this is only just beginning. It will take some time for these tools and technologies to be democratised, commoditised and to be in the hands of ordinary people, and for the middle class to regain its wage-earning capacity, its productive capacity and its fair share of national wealth. So that is my hypothesis for what is currently happening in society and economics, and in the political arena as well.

11 Now let me cite a few examples. Many of these examples you will be familiar with, but they help make the point.

12 In the mobile banking space, many of you would have heard of Safaricom’s M-Pesa. Since Kenya’s M-Pesa brought banking-by-phone to Africa, this has grown from a novelty to a bona fide payment network. Even at a few dollars a transaction, mobile payments in sub-Saharan Africa will generate about US$1.5 bn in fees for mobile money providers by 2019, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group. It was also reported that in sub-Saharan Africa, more people will have a mobile money account than Facebook account. Mobile phones are clearly spreading faster than bank branches, and especially in emerging markets like India, Bangladesh, Africa and other parts of Asia. It is no wonder therefore that many banks and telcos (such as Safaricom), and even Technology Giants (such as Google and Apple) are now focused on creating innovative financial services via the mobile channels.

13 If you move into the retail space, you’ve heard of the names: eBay, Amazon and Alibaba. Alibaba has come to dominate Internet Retailing in China, and frankly anyone who dominates any sector in China is going to be huge. Just to give you some idea of scale, Alibaba has moved beyond its remit of just connecting businesses to each other, which is how it started. It has moved far beyond that. It now allows companies to sell directly to the public, and for the members of the public to transact with each other. We’ve heard of Tmall, we’ve heard of Taobao. Taobao and Tmall processed 1.1 trillion yuan – which I think is about US$170 billion - in transactions in 2012, and in September 2014, Alibaba's market value was measured at US$231 bn. I am sure the numbers have changed since then, but these are numbers with many zeros.

14 In the crowdsourcing space, you have heard of Kickstarter and Indiegogo, and nowadays artists, entrepreneurs, communities, even people in trouble with the government can raise funds from crowdsourcing sites – to raise funds from the “4F Bank”. You know what the 4Fs are? Fans, Family, Friends and Fools. We laugh about it. But the point is that it allows everyone to mobilise funds and it goes far beyond this 4Fs, because in this world currently awash with liquidity and low interest rates, people are looking for ideas and services to take a bet on. According to the Crowdfunding Industry Report by Massolution, in 2012, US$2.7 bn was raised online through crowdfunding, and this number can only grow.

**15 In the virtual currencies space, Rajendra mentioned Bitcoin, and I think you had a convention or a seminar on it. Frankly, I am not sure about the future of cryptocurrency, although clearly if you think about the way governments are managing paper currency, it doesn’t give you great confidence either. But actually what intrigues me more is the technology behind Bitcoin. I am not sure how many of you are familiar with the Blockchain Technology. Blockchain technology is a computational algorithm that enables distributed verification of the integrity of ledger items. Whether that item is a transfer of money, or cryptocurrency, or contracts, or services, it is in fact a generic platform technology which I believe has not yet found the most appropriate use case. But nevertheless, further breakthroughs in this area will open up the world and will disrupt services in a major way.**

16 And for those of you who are involved in banking and finance, you know that some key competitive advantages which banks have had are (i) funds (ii) reputation (iii) some kind of protection by government regulations and (iv) knowing your customers’ businesses because you were lending them money - in other words you had access to information. But if you were to stop and think about it, what this technological wave has done is that it potentially disintermediates all those competitive advantages which banks and traditional financial institutions have had. You want access to funds, you can go to crowdfunding portals. As for having information on what businesses are doing, it is not just banks, and it is not just the consultants like Accenture, it is the people who have accurate pulse on the flow of bits, data, and transactions who know what is going on. I think David Lee was telling me just now that Alibaba employs hundreds of PhDs to do data mining. Is Alibaba really a retailer or is it actually in the information business? Are telcos really just selling you voice or are they preludes to the mobile banking business? Even Amazon or take any logistics company, are they really just delivering pizzas and electronics or are they really in the fulfilment business? So the point I am making is that if you can find the centre of gravity between money, information, fulfilment, and then the elusive quality called trust, that is where a huge focal point of opportunity is.

17 So I hope I have given you enough food for thought. I just want to appeal for you to do three things.

18 First, please for the sake of Singapore and Singaporean institutions, find new ways to deliver new services to our people and the people beyond Singapore. If our banks, financial institutions and businesses are doing exactly the same thing next year as they were doing last year, we are going to be swamped, because the pace of change is not slowing down. So please find new ways to deliver new services.

19 Second, please focus on this field of data science and data analytics. Whether you are a bank, financial institution, consultancy firm or university, we now live in the age of big data. And I used to joke with my medical colleagues that you almost do not need to do a clinical trial now, when you can measure the universe. Why settle for a sample and then engage in fancy statistical gymnastics to prove your conclusions, when you can measure everything in real time. So pay attention to data analytics and data science.

20 Third, we need more rational, careful, and technologically-based conversations on the issues of cybersecurity, protection of privacy, and especially protection of identity. Because you cannot have a world that is fully able to take advantage of financial innovations, information revolution, even electronic medical records, if a decent level of security, protection from identity theft, and protection from a loss of privacy and confidentiality is not guaranteed. In other words, security is the essential flip side of the coin of utility; and if we can get that done right here, then we have a head start.

21 So my final point is why Smart Nation. The answer is: we do so because we have no choice. Like many things we have done in Singapore for the last 50 years, all the way back to the time when Mr Sim Kee Boon was a pioneer senior civil servant working for Mr Lee Kuan Yew, we had to break new grounds, we had to be adventurous, we had to be innovative because we have no choice. Jobs were going to disappear in the early 1970s as the British forces pulled out of all ports east of the Suez, and that’s why we industrialised. Similarly, what I have described now is potentially another occasion when 20 to 30 percent of previously stable, good, middle class, white collar jobs are at risk because you cannot out-compete a robot, a machine, or a computer for routine, white collar work.

22 So we need to do all these things, and we believe we have an edge because we are small, and we have a single layer of government. Half of our cabinet ministers are engineers. Our PM is a mathematician who can still code. If you do not believe me, you can check his Facebook account and so far after five days, people have only found a little boundary error in his algorithm. But it is a very elegant program.

23 So the point is that we get it, we understand technology, we are not afraid of Science and Technology, but we need to have not just the PM coding, we need an entire society that is capable of understanding and exploiting the opportunities that this wave provides for us. So I wish you all the very best and I hope SMU, and especially the Sim Kee Boon Institute, continues to break new ground, not just because it is fun, but because it is essential for our continued prosperity and progress as a nation. Thank you all very much.",cryptocurrency,1431434785

She has about 4000 left on a student loan with an interest rate of 2.625%, which is our 3rd highest interest rate account.  She thinks this is 'good' debt to have and the interest is tax deductible, so it's worth paying down slowly.  I say, let's kill this debt, because the $145 we paid in interest last year isn't REALLY being made up for in tax benefits.  What I plan on doing is using the 130 we pay every month for this loan, and applying it to my student loan, which is about $20,000 and 3.25%.

My real question I guess is: Should we pay the loan off, or are we better off claiming the interest on taxes?

personalfinance,A friend of mine is on the brink of forclosure.,"She told me this in confidence, but is okay with my asking for advice on her behalf here on Reddit.

The Monthly Bills:

* Car insurance- $250
* Mortgage- $913
* Car payment- $300
* Cell- $220
* Cable/Internet- $220
* Groceries- $400
* Gas- $240
* Credit Card- $141

The Debts:

1. **Credit Card**- There is roughly $4000 left at 16%
2. **Mortgage**- The house was appraised at 165k. She doesn't know exactly how much is left, but their loan at the time they bought it was for $127k, so at least she's not underwater in it. She can get the amount for me later. The interest rate is 4.5%.

The Situation:

Her mother became very ill and could not work anymore to take care of her debts. My friend, let's call her Jill, couldn't let her Mom starve, so Jill took on credit card debt to support her mother. Her mother unfortunately passed away from her illness, and Jill now has this debt.

While caring for her mother, she got behind on her mortgage by 5 months. Not only that, but her husband's once stable income has recently become unreliable. He used to bring in $3400 a month, now he's lucky to bring home $1200. He's a concrete contractor. There's been tons of flooding where we live, so nobody needs concrete poured right now. Jill has also recently lost her job.

The stress is killing her. 

I suggested that she drop the cable and downgrade the phones. Her cable contract ends in 4 months, and there are 3 months left on the phones. She is going to call and see what the termination fees are to see if it's worth it to drop now, or if they need to wait until the contracts are up.

What emergency fund they had, has long been drained. There are no more savings, and they don't even have a retirement fund to borrow against. I told her to *stay away* from pay day loans no matter what, but I don't know what else I can tell her. 

The bank is threatening foreclosure proceedings by June 1st if they don't pay 5k in back payments. Jill has already started packing things up since they don't have the 5k. She is trying to find a new job, and her husband is taking all the work he can. Is there anything else they can do? Can they even try to sell the house at this point? Can you pay a mortgage with an equity loan? I think both their credits are wrecked, so that might not even be an option. Is there anything else they can do?

personalfinance,(UK/NZ) Help with student loan in NZ but earning in the UK.,"Hi there, I moved to the UK a couple of years ago from NZ, leaving behind approx. NZ$55k of student debt.

My repayment obligation is now NZ$4k a year. I pay £180 (approx $350) a month (after tax) directly to NZ, which I am hoping to increase to £200/250 shortly, depending on my job situation. Note, there are no fees for these transfers as there is a fee free deal.

In NZ, I am now being charged 9.2% interest on the loan (thanks JK), so am barely paying off the interest.

My question is, would it be a better idea to get a loan in the UK and pay off the debt in full?

My concerns are; 
 - NZ IRD can be flexible with payment, so if something happens and you are unable to pay, they will sort out a payment plan (even as little as £10 a month). Not sure a UK bank would be the same.
 - Unsure of what kind of interest rate I'd get given that as I've only been in the UK a couple of years, my credit rating is still a the low end (3/5 on the free noddle site).
 - Worried about tying myself in to a long term debt here, as I may move home eventually and the minute I begin to earn back in NZ, repayments will come out before tax and I won't have to think about it.

Other details about me;
 - currently earn around £25k a year, this is soon going to change to somewhere between £28-32k
 - currently saving £300-400 a month (a chunk of which goes into paying back my parents for money they have lent me previously).

personalfinance,Running out of cash. How to delay payments on mortgage and other expenses?,"**EDIT**: Thank you everyone. Not a troll. Just, f'ed up my finances. Starting work on a budget today. So many bills, it's hard to keep track. Any advice on delaying payments is still appreciated. I think I need a budget *and* some more time.

I live in the US. I have a decent income, but running out of cash. I don't know what to do or what will happen when I do run out of cash. If I stop paying certain bills, things won't get ""bad"" right away, right? Which bills can I delay paying, with minimal ""bad"" effects? For how long can I delay paying them? How do I do it? (Granted, that does not solve my problem, but it buys me a little more time.) 

A few years ago, I accidentally discovered how to do this with medical bills. You have a medical bill and you don't pay. They keep sending it to you. Then, after awhile, they send it to a collections agency, which starts haggling you. When you return their call, you ask whether, if you pay today, they are willing to give you a discount. On larger bills, I've received discounts of 20%+, even as much as 50%. Result: I delayed paying a bill for a few months, and in the end, instead of paying a penalty, I actually paid less. 

Is anything like that possible with any of my other bills, of which there are plenty?

* My biggest bill is the mortgage payment, which includes an escrow payment for real estate tax. What happens if I stop paying and how long do I have?
* Homeowners Association (HOA) fee. What will happen if I stop paying the HOA? 
* Utilities, mainly electricity. Landline phone. How long do they give you until they turn off the service?
* Car loan. What happens if I stop paying? How long until they take away my car? What about financial penalties?
* Car insurance. If I don't pay, will it lapse right away? So I have to keep paying?
* Student loan. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ee4a4/wife_and_i_are_losing_money_down_to_3k_in_the/) talks about hardship forbearance. I have to investigate it more. Anything else I can do? 
* Loan against my 401k. I don't think I can do anything here. They take payments directly out of my paycheck.
* Preschool payments. How long until they kick my kid out of school? (Public preschool is only for the poor. Since I have an income, I don't qualify. Hurray!)
* Credit card, which I use to buy everything, including groceries, gas, and everything else, and which I pay in full every month. I do qualify for one of those promotions where I can transfer the balance and pay ""0%"" for X number of months. It's alright, but not as great as it sounds. You do pay a 3% fee, so it's not really 0%. Plus, you can only transfer your balance for a couple of months. 
	* Any other ideas for credit cards? Or how to make purchases some other way, where it's easier to delay payments?

What else can I do?",finance,1431451540

personalfinance,29/m trying to get a grip on my finances,"I'll be hitting 30 next year, and like too many other American kids, I spent my 20s spending myself into debt with no understanding of what it meant. 

My life has gotten a bit more serious in the past year, I got a great promotion at work and I'm planning to propose to my girlfriend within the year, but I want to get my finances in order before taking such a big step. 

The biggest issue I would like to get a handle on is my credit card debt. I've got $13k spread out over several cards at interest rates ranging between 17-23%. 

Additionally, due to a high utilization (about 90%), this debt is killing my credit score. I used to have a score above 700, but as my utilization rose, several of my cards cut their limits hurting my utilization even more, and my score has dropped below 650 for the first time. 

Over the past several months, I've gotten a good grip on my spending and have managed to start making a dent in my balances, but I've quickly realized that the high interest rates are really slowing things down. 

Would it make sense to look into consolidating the debt to a single lower interest loan and getting rid of the credit cards altogether?

I realize with my credit score in the dumps right now it might be smart to pay off some of the higher balances first to get my score back up a little higher before applying for any loans because that will greatly affect the rates I can get. 

About $3500 of the CC debt is on cards with interest rates close to 23% with the remaining $9500 on cards below 20%. 

I think I can pay off the $3500 in the next few months. Would it make sense to do that first and then start looking into lower interest loans to consolidate the remaining $9500 and get it on a single payoff plan?

I've seen some great offers from credit unions like MCI and I've heard great things about Lending Tree. What do you guys recommend, and how low should I try to get my utilization / how high should I try to get my credit score before applying for a consolidation loan?

I'd really like to get this CC debt squared away onto a simple monthly payment at a reasonable interest rate so that I can start learning more about saving and investing with my extra money. I realize that the best return on any investment comes from paying off debts first, but if I can get a decent rate on the last few thousand dollars, it would allow me to at least start getting my feet wet with figuring out the rest of my long term savings plan.

ethereum,"Ethereum name, logo and psi effects :)","I was recently thinking about how _awesome_ the ""ethereum"" name and logo are!  The name sounds great _and_ it's extremely unique (like the name ""google""), so it works excellent for branding.  


Also, the root word ""ether"" has massive historical and scientific significance as many scientists of the past believed ether (or ""aether"") was the medium that light traveled through (famous 19th century [Michelson–Morley experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment)) _and_ the substance where all of space, time, and matter exists!  

(I personally still believe aether exists, but it's now called the [Zero Point Field](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-baksa/zero-point-field_b_913831.html)...1 cubic meter of the ZPF contains enough energy to boil all the water of all the oceans on planet earth!)

The word ""ether"" is a perfect metaphor for the background substance that will hold-together and power Web 3.0.


The crystal tetrahedron logo is also badass!


Here's where my psi story comes in...Vitalik said he found the name ""ethereum"" while browsing a Wiki list of elements from science fiction.  The name ethereum is from the 1986 movie ""Laputa:  Castle in the Sky"".  Here are some [screenshots](http://imgur.com/0DjIbez) of the movie - a massive tetrahedron ethereum crystal is making an entire Castle float in the sky - the massive crystal is identical to the ethereum cryptocurrency logo!


Whoever knows, please tell me exactly who created the logo for ethereum and how and why they chose it.  They could've simply chose the crystal shape from the 1986 cartoon, _or_ they could've ""created it on their own"", which would certainly be a case of psi.


For those who aren't well read in the psi area, here are a few examples:

-  A novel written 14 years before the Titanic - [Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futility,_or_the_Wreck_of_the_Titan)...in the ""unsinkable"" Titan novel, all the details are nearly identical with the actual Titanic story...trust me, click my Wiki link and read the details - it'll blow your mind!!!

-  50 years before Bobby Fischer's dominance of the chess world, a fictional novel was written about an American grandmaster named Bobby who dominated the chess world (with identical details and idiosyncrasies to the real Bobby Fischer)

-  A book written by Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating's brother, 4 years _before_ The OKC bombing, featured a Federal building bomber named Tom McVey, pulled over exactly like McVeigh for a minor equipment violation.

-  All of the [911 stuff](https://johnkimber.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/simpsons-9-11-1997-m11-622131.jpg) that appears in cartoons and other media _before_ the actual 911 attacks...and NO, the ""Illuminati"" didn't 'put hints' in the Simpsons cartoon about what ""they where going to do""


As David Hume [pointed-out](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/) with his Causal Skepticism - inductive causal claims lack proper justification.  Just because A and B always occur in ""constant conjunction"" doesn't necessarily imply a causal relationship.

If you want your mind blown about causality and psi effects, listen to this [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aan5hiQYlNs) from Dr. Dean Radin.

Those of you not familiar with psi effects probably think I'm crazy...lol  My point is - powerful events in human history can often ""leak backwards in time"" and they'll appear in a novel or other types of artwork.  My hope is that a 1986 Anime production was influenced by something that powerfully changed the world 30 years in the future.  (or not...maybe all the causal relationships were ""forward in time""...but if my psi theory is correct, then ethereum is going to be powerful and world changing!)",cryptocurrency,1431466124
technology,"Tom McClintock, CA Representative FINALLY (after a full year) replied to my Net Neutrality support e-mail.","Dear Exit143

Thank you for contacting me regarding government regulation of the Internet.

 

Fundamentally, I believe that freedom of access to the Internet is a value of paramount importance that can only survive under a competitive free market, not the heavy hand of government.  I am very troubled by the actions of the Federal Communications Commission in March that absurdly classified the Internet as a ""publicly switched telephone network"" and subjected it to the onerous and antiquated provisions of the 1934 Communications Act.

 

While these regulations were imposed under the guise of promoting openness and fair access, they are bound to achieve precisely the opposite result.  Since bandwidth is a scarce commodity – there is simply not enough to fulfill the unlimited needs of every user – it has been allocated since the Internet's first days by the free market to its most efficient use.  The new FCC order sacrifices that fundamentally fair system in favor of political considerations and government edicts.  

 

Furthermore, the FCC has opened the door for federal bureaucracy to someday regulate content and impose taxes – both ruinous to the notions of unfettered access and the free exchange of ideas.

 

Finally, the FCC's power grab upends the very model of Internet governance that had made its rapid development possible in the first place.  Starting with the Clinton administration, and for over twenty years, there had been widespread consensus that the Internet is best governed by its users and the innovators who provide the experience and ingenuity required to keep it constantly growing and evolving.  The future of such rapid advances is in great doubt if the Internet stays shackled by a law written when copper wire was still a novelty. 

 

I will continue to advocate for the free market as the cornerstone of Internet governance.

Please visit my website at http://mcclintock.house.gov to reach me regarding any issue that concerns you or your family.  Again, thank you for contacting me.

personalfinance,Is it advisable to take out a short term loan or line of credit to pay off a Visa with a large balance?,"Putting aside the solid financial advice to never get into this situation in the first place, what would you suggest?

After speaking with the bank, appears the options are:
-Continue to pay 18.99% on the Visa (~$5k balance)
-Take out a short-term loan (10-12% interest)
-Take out a line of credit (6-7% interest)

How should I proceed?","So, I am just about begin a graduate school program, which I will graduate in just over two years from now with $130,000 in school loan debt. Unfortunately, most of the school loans in this debt have interest rates of over 7%. Some are under 4, others under 6, but for argument's sake lets make it all $130,000 at 7% for planning purposes.

Anyways, when I graduate, I am going into a field which makes on average about 80K (this is about 10k lower than both mean and median salary, so I think it'll be good to plan with.)

I will also be getting married, and my future wife will be working whatever she can, hopefully at 10 dollars an hour, likely more depending on where I end up working.

So between the two of us, we will hopefully be bringing in $100,000 before taxes. My big question is, what do I do with my money. We will be 23 and 24 with $130,000 in school loan debt at 7%.

Here is where I am planning on putting my money immediately after graduating:

1) Paying off school loan debt  
2) Roth IRA (one for each of us)  
3) 401k (one for each of us? maybe? or is there a good reason why I should just get one?)  
4) Emergency fund of 10k (Should be saved up prior to graduation)  
5) I am estimating 700$ per month in car payments to start off. I live in a snowy state and want two reliable cars with all wheel drive.  
6) rent 1200  
7) other normal living expenses (gas, food, cell phone, cable and internet, insurance)  
8) Everything left over will either be put into an emergency fund, 401k, IRA, or paying off loan. which leads to my big question-  

In what ratios should I put money into paying off the loan/ 401ks/ Roth IRAs?

My loan payments are going to be fairly high I would imagine, but I am absolutely planning on making more than minimum payments. Based on what we will be making, what will be best? 

What if I end up in a rural area where it takes her to find a job, and we are only making 80k, does that make any difference?

Also, is a 10,000 dollar emergency fund good enough to begin?

If that's the case, how much do I invest into paying off my loans, and how much should I invest in my 401k(s) and Roth IRAs?

I know it's two years away, but I figure it's never too early to start thinking of these things.

I got into my dream school of Emerson College in Boston and should be entering as a Junior this fall as a TV Production Major.

I applied for Financial Aid and my school found me over $17,000 for the first year I attend. However as I will be attending full time and living off campus I need $60,382 for the year. 

$12,500 of the $17,000 is already a Direct Federal loan. So I will need another $42,857 of loans if I can't get any scholarships for my first year. And another $42,857 for my senior year as well. 

So I might be looking at a $110,714 debt for a Television Degree if you count the $12,500 from Federal and the $42,857 Private loans I will need each year. However this is at a school with an Impressive alumni and great connections. 

I have seen multiple times on this subreddit people who get ""useless degrees"" for an expensive price and don't want to be asking three years later how to get myself out of this hole. 

I'm asking if I should maybe avoid the hole altogether?

I might have other options, such as getting a AA at my Community College and going into News but News has never really been a passion of mine.

I could wait and apply to cheaper state schools? Choose a more sensible career path like business of HR? Although I have no Passion for either things. 

Or just join the work force somehow.

I decided a year ago that I wanted to get a credit card as tool for credit building. This credit card is only to be used as a tool and not to be confused with an ""emergency fund"" or ""extra money""...but I have been a bit gun shy.

Is this enough credit use to benefit my credit score (I am aware that process is very slow)?

-LOANS: Currently I have about 4k saved for my next loan I am registering for, that number should climb to about 10k in next 5 months. I am currently at school and have about 4 weeks left in my semester out of 10. Then I will be off to work for 3 months. 

-What I owe so far- bottom line I owe about 10k so far with a 13.26% interest rate. Last years schooling for freshman year was about 43k due to mandatory dorm housing and meal plans. This should decrease by about 5k next semester if I were to live at home and commute to school about an hour. My parents paid a lot of my freshman year, which I am very grateful for, but after this Freshman year I am not receiving any more assistance from them. 

-Schooling total per year- about $37,000 a year, that being because of $18.5k per semester.

So my question to you Reddit, what loans are the cheapest/best for the long run? And how can I best prepare myself for the future loans? Me being where I am in my life I do not know much about loans other than interest rates and how they are compounding monthly. I do not want to be $120,000 in debt by the time I graduate!

personalfinance,Did I dun goof while applying for a loan today?,"As some of you may remember, recently I made a thread about handling some debt I had unwisely tangled myself in. Basically, I had around $10k worth of debt tied up in credit that I was looking to consolidate. I decided to go to the bank and take out a personal loan for a lot of reasons:

- To get away from high APR's associated with credit cards (I had APR's ranging from 10.35 all the way to 24.99 I believe was the highest)
- To lower my monthly payment
- To make one payment instead of several
- To help improve my credit by not having several accounts close to their limit
- To accurately report my debt to income ratio by applying for this loan to pay off all existing credit while I am earning the highest salary I have already earned

Here's the part where I goofed, but I'm not sure how bad it hurt me, if at all.

At one point, the banker asked me about my GROSS monthly income. I answered with my NET, which is about 800 dollars a month less. I mixed the two up unknowingly. Assuming I understood the question, I just answered it without double checking.

Would I have gotten better terms if I gave the correct answer? Would it not have really mattered? If there would be a big difference, is there anything at all I can do to change this? Thanks in advance for your help.",finance,1431486015

personalfinance,(CAN) Young family needs help getting on right track.,"I would just like to warn anyone reading this that I am *very* painfully aware of how bad this is and how much we have screwed up. My wife and I have had a tumultuous past few years and are on a very good footing now. Except our finances. Id like some advice as to how to proceed with paying off our massive debt. I think the best thing going for us is that we don’t pay any rent. We are caretakers for an apartment block. We pay no rent at all, and very little utilities. 

Anyways, please take a look at the numbers. I welcome any constructive feedback! I would be so appreciative.

Note: We are in Canada. We are both 32 and our child is 4.

Credit Card 1: 962 @ 19.9% minimum is 20$
Credit Card 2: 11,415 @ 9.99 minimum is 160$

Bank Loan 1: 11,160  @ 7.35% bi weekly payments of 192 on payday.
Bank Loan 2:  7,230   @ 7.35% b/w payment of 140 on payday.

Car: 12,000 for 5 years 147 b/w on payday friday.
Car insurance: 100$ monthly. 

Student loan debts: together we owe about 35k. In canada its separated between provincial loans and federal loans, and for the time being we both only have to pay the provincial loans, as we qualify for lower payments due to low income. We pay $70 a month combined right now. Nothing to federal, but that could change in a few months when our repayment assistance period is up.

Income:

I make about 50k a year, pay into a pension, and extended health benefits.

I take home about 1,150 every two weeks, so 2,300 a month.

My wife takes home about 660 a month in wages plus a bit of tips.

We get a government payment of 250$ every month.

So we bring in 3,210 monthly, and yet we can’t seem to dig our way out of debt. 

Our total debt is just under $77,000. 

We have just started to seriously make a budget, and i have taken on a second job. (although Im not sure how long that will last. I work M-F days at a very physical job and she works MWF evenings, and we have a young child. And we do caretaking duties on top of everything. I don’t know if its even worth working a few shifts at minimum wage.)

So to the question: I've racked up about $40,000.00 in Federal Student Loans. I've finally found a state job and discovered that as a public servant, I'm eligible for student loan forgiveness. Talked to the dude on the phone today. He stated I could make $100 payments for 10 years and the rest will be forgiven! Totally great news since right now I pay $550.00 a month.

However the catch: I'm married with no dependents. We usually file our taxes married joint. With this program, we will be required to file married separate. How badly with this mess with our taxes?

-We keep all of our assets and debts separate, aside from 1 GE loan.  
-In New York, my husband owns a house. I'm not on the deed, note, or mortgage

investing,Who wants to short Japan?,"For those of you who don't know, Japan has 220% debt to gdp, an aging population, declining workforce and uses nearly half its tax revenue just to service debt on ultra low interest rates. As the government continues to issue more debt, the central bank has stepped in to create new currency and buy bonds and now buys 70% of all new bond issuance.  Two scenarios seem likely to play out for the foreseeable future:

1. The central bank continues to print more currency and buy government bonds and the Yen weakens against the dollar and commodities like gold. You could short the Yen against the dollar and gold or borrow in Yen like Mark Cuban who currently has all the Dallas Maverick's debt in Yen.

2. Seeing the currency that they are being paid back in decline, holders of Japanese debt sell their bonds, causing prices to fall and yields to rise. Japan is then forced to either raise rates to entice foreign creditors (which will increase the interest they pay) or default on their debt. Shorting Japanese government debt is the likely play there.

I've found numerous resources below that explain the situation further and give investing advice on how to take advantage of it.

personalfinance,[Banking] Looking for a new bank/credit union for several reasons.,"Ok, let's start by saying, i'm terrible with money.  I have awful spending habits and i've never been able to save a dollar in my life.

First  credit union I had was OK, but had awful overdraft fees and because it was a local credit union they were...subpar quality as far as service and standards go.  I left them some years ago, and signed up with USAA.

USAA was GREAT for a long time until we ran into some SNAFUs(right word here?)  I found that anytime I tried to deposit a check from a new location they would hold between 10-70% of the check for 8 business days.  I tried calling and speaking with them but due to my ""excessive overdraft record"" they didn't want to push the funds.  This makes absolutely no sense to me, because of MY bad record, you think my employer's check won't clear?  We even called our payroll bank together and they said it was all on USAA and USAA still wouldn't budge on it.  I had to pay my rent and utilites late.  Anywho, I was fed up and decided to move to another local credit union, oh boy was that a mistake.  

Wife and I walked in to sign up for the account, spent 45 minutes to an hour filling out paperwork and talking(seems very excessive to me), then they told us we'd have to deposit 25$ to start our account.  We were like, cool, get paid in two days, we'll just drop the check in and boom we're open.  They closed our account because we didn't deposit right then and there.  Then after reopening the account for me, they wanted to charge me to cash my check.(I pay my rent with cash-to-money order every month to avoid bouncing a check/paying % extra for card.)  It ended up being a percentage and it cost me about 8$ to cash it.  Pissed.  Then THEY held a check on me for 8 days.  small personal check, not that big of a deal but still.   Then I found they stack their charges strangely resulting in hefy hefty fees.  Like if i spent, 5$, 5$, 5$, 40$.  in that order, they take the 40$ first, then hit me with 3 overdraft fees instead of one.  Their balance does not update for several days at a time even using debit.  With USAA it was instantaneous.  Oh and the last straw, I asked for my ATM withdrawal limit to be increased so that I could pull my rent out monthly without having to visit a branch (atm fees refunded here.)  they said no and they wouldn't do it.  

TL;DR:  Looking for a bank/credit union that:



* Updates the balances at least very quickly
* Preferably refunds ATM fees
* Mobile app is a must
* Free checking I guess is a thing
* Local to Mobile county, AL (hopefully, maybe? 100% online is fine if there's a way to deposit cash/checks in person)
* I would prefer 24-hour customer service, but I understand I won't get that with most institutions.",finance,1431521741

personalfinance,Very specific personal finance question: pay cash for car vs. pay off credit cards,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I read the Rules and the Wiki, and I think I'm posting this in the right place. Please forgive me if that's not true. I'm happy to delete and re-post this in the proper place. I've learned a lot just reading the Wiki -- so thank you!

Anyway, I have a bit of a dilemma on my hands. Currently, I have about $10,000 in credit card debt. I have been getting by paying just above the minimums for the last couple of years (~$500/month). Recently, I landed a new job that will increase my salary by about $15,000/year (~30%) overnight. Since I am a teacher, this job will start in September. While I am thrilled about this new development, it comes with a caveat: I will need a reliable car to get to and from work (currently, I take the train).

I have also been fortunate enough to land a summer job that will net me about $7-8k in additional income over the summer. *So, here's my dilemma: Do I put all of that money into (almost) paying off my credit card debt, while financing my new car? Or, do I save the cash and put that all toward buying a car, and worry about paying down my credit card debt with my new income next year? Or, would you recommend some kind of combination of the two?*

Since the interest rate on my CC debt is sky-high, I'm inclined to want to put as much money into those as possible and 100% finance the cheapest reliable car that I can find (even if it's at a 5-6% interest rate due to my shitty credit). Is this a misguided approach?

personalfinance,Wife and I just finished paying off our student loans!,"Wanted to make a post discussing our debt payoff journey so far over the past two years (25 months), paying off just under $61,000 in that time, averaging ~$2440 per month.

Here is where we started: [Start](https://imgur.com/vixEiUj)

And here is where we ended up: [Victory!](https://imgur.com/mplFUYn)

We *somewhat* followed the Dave Ramsey plan, though did not go as scorched earth as he typically suggests (we still had a budget for eating out). We certainly didn't deprive ourselves of all luxuries, but certainly reduced our lifestyle well below our income. 

**The particulars** (since I know people always want to know these):

* Gross income: $102,000 to start; $121,000 current (before bonuses - see below)

* Method used: Debt Snowball - because of the particular interest rates and balances, the difference between Snowball and      Avalanche was ~$200-300 over the two years. Was worth it for us to have the small psychological victories along the way. The snowball has grown to $2,300 since we started.

**Points of note:**

* We established monthly budgets accounting for 2 pay periods each month, for 24 total pay periods each year. For the months of the year when we had 3 paychecks (25th and 26th pay periods) we threw those entire checks at the debt, effectively paying an extra month's worth of net income at the debt each of the two years.

* Not all, but the vast majority of bonuses that were received during this time also went towards the debt.

* We increased our income during this period by raises and me switching jobs. We did not significantly increase our lifestyle with these pay increases (will admit we added $50 more per month to the restaurant budget at one point to loosen things up a bit).
 
* Our cost of living compared to our income (especially now) is quite low, with a PITI payment that is only 14.38% of our net income each month (God bless Texas). That certainly freed up a decent amount of cash to be able to put towards debt

**Next Steps:**

* Contrary to PF advice, we are going to pay off the remainder of our car loan over the next ~4 months, even though it is at 2.19%. We don't want the $438 payment we *have* to make in case of one of us (or both) losing our job. The ""loss"" in potential interest is worthwhile to us for the peace of mind. We will be completely debt free except our house in September according to plan.

* Max IRAs for both of us for this next year

* Start stockpiling cash for a new car and down payment on our next house

1 - E-trade sent the IRS a statement containing a bond sale that I made, and the IRS took it as income instead of capital gains. The sale was for about $10800, I made $800 profit. They wanted to tax me $800 on it (I had low income that year). This was 2011.

2 - I filed my first return this year since 2011 where I was owed a refund. The IRS took out the (now) $900 owed from my federal return - fair enough. But they also took $900 from my state return.

personalfinance,28/m Divorced. Stuck with ex-wife's student loan. What are my options?,"So I just received a call from a collection agency saying they are trying to collect on a $14,000 private student loan that I had co-signed for my ex-wife 2 years ago before we got married. I think I am fucked because apparently i'm not eligible for the ""co-signer release"" which is a option with some banks after 12-36 months of consecutive payments through the collection agency that called me. 

Apparently nobody at the collection agency can reach her, and it's likely she won't respond to my Facebook messages. I told the guy over the phone that there is no way in hell i'd pay on that loan, but he said that the interest rate for the loan is 10.26% and that there is currently $122.53 of interest on top of the loan and it'll only go up as long as it sits there and nobody pays. 

So I need some advice and options. How badly will this affect my credit if I let it go? Basically in the debt collector's minds her and I are equally responsible for the loan, so if I let this go and ""forget"" about it then it'll affect my credit just as badly as hers' right? 

I don't know what to do. The only way I would pay anything on this loan, is if I somehow got a hold of her and she agreed to pay the majority of it and I would supplement the payment somehow. I have my own student loans to pay ($48k), and I just started building my credit back up when I get hit with this shit. 

Thanks for reading. 

Pro-tip: Don't co-sign anything for anyone. 


**Update:** Thank you (some of you) for your helpful replies. I did get a hold of my ex, and she said she will call the debt collector today to see if she can get my name off of the loan. Whether that happens or not, I don't know yet. I'll update if I learn anything new. I also called my attorney and left her a message, and i'll update about that when she calls me back. I agree with some of you that the likely scenario is that they won't just take my name off of the debt even if she requests it because this way they have two people to go after for the money instead of just her. I will also inquire to see if someone else in her family would be willing to sign something that says they'll be the cosigner for the balance. If that doesn't work, and she skips out on the payments then I fully understand that i'll be responsible for it. In that case i'll try to get the whole amount over to my name so she doesn't benefit from the re-payment as far as her credit. I will update when I learn more.",finance,1431540267

About us:  I am 39, my wife is 31, we both work full time, and we have 3 kids (a 5 yo and twin 1 year olds).  We just moved to a new house.  We had a hard time selling our old house and ended up getting quite a bit less money than we were expecting.  The old house is finally sold, and we are now taking stock and trying to plan for the next few years.

**Current financial situation**

$70,000 debt on a line of credit (3.85% interest rate)

$45,000 debt that we will have to pay in the next 1-3 years due to a sketchy investment we made a few years ago

$532,000 mortgage (2.7% interest rate)

No credit card debt

Car payments of $746.09 on our minivan (37 months until it's paid off)

*

We also have a live-in nanny who we pay $10.20 per hour, 44 hours per week.  We also provide her 15 meals per week (she is away on the weekends).  We recognize that this is a big expense, but it's cheaper than day care.  

Our goal is to pay off the line of credit and the sketchy investment as fast as possible.  But I started to do some numbers and based on our current spending it will take a hell of a long time.  Here is what we are currently doing with our money.

*

**Fixed costs (per month)** 

Mortgage $2165.16

Car payment $746.09

Property taxes $400

Nanny $1750

Car insurance $151.79 (two cars)

Life insurance $64.75

Home insurance $77.94

Cell phones $75

Interest on line of credit $250 (roughly)

Utilities (heat, electricity, water) $275

My wife's student loans $131.67 (interest is tax-deductible)

Family gym/pool membership $60.56

Bank fee $10

Warcraft $19 

Church donation $40 (tax deductible)

Netflix $8

Total fixed costs of roughly $6225

*

**Income (typical month)**

My take home pay $3669.84 x 2 = $7339.68 

My wife's pay $3570.62

Child tax credit $300 (Canada)

Total income: $11210.30

*

This leave a balance of roughly $4985 for all other expenses plus savings.  Seems like a lot right?  **Here's where it is going on average:**

Groceries $1500 per month

Restaurants $750 per month

Gas $250

My spending on lunches and coffee at work $300 (my wife takes her lunch)

Wine/Beer $300

RESP contribution $500 (this is an account to save money for our kids' educations) 

This leaves just shy of $1400 for additional savings and unusual expenses.

*

At this rate it will take roughly 115000 / 1400 = 82 months to pay off our short term debt.  And that assumes no unusual expenses; but of course there always seems to be something on top of what we've budgeted.  And it doesn't leave any extra room for saving for retirement.

We did not plan to be in this situation, but the sale of our old house did not go according to plan.  We ended up getting a lot less that we had expected and also having to put a bunch of money into repairs in order to sell it at all.  We also had to carry two mortgages for several months before we finally found a buyer.  ANYWAY that is finally resolved and we are trying to make smart decisions going forward.

Any advice would be appreciated.  If you were in this situation, what would be the first things you would change?  Please be honest, I won't be offended.",finance,1431548084

Both of the cars are used and in good condition which should last us at least 3-4 years (05 TSX, 04 Cavalier).  House has a value of between $200,000 and $215,000.  I've been looking into the idea of refinancing my mortgage to bring the balance up to $172,000...would this be advantageous with current low interest rates?  We have additional assets (I put 6% of my income to company stock, 4% of my income to RSPs, and have a pension I contribute to as well....wife roughly about the same...our net income is after these payments).  Collectively our stock is around $15,000.  Since April I've also been saving 10% of our income in a savings as we haven't been doing this, so when shit hits the fan, we had to ask parents for money or sell stock as we didn't have a plan B.

We're at an age where we should start having kids, but right now there isn't a lot of money left over per month, and going to reduced parental leave pay + increased cost of baby would leave us under water.

Right now of our $5,500 per month salary we spend $1400 on housing costs: mortgage, taxes, hydro/water/gas, maintenance fee (townhouse).  We spend around $950/month on transportation (both car payments, both our gas costs, car insurance, and maintenance). We spend around $850 in debt repayment, ~$542 in savings, and $1400 on living expenses (Internet, 2x Cell phone, Netflix, Groceries, and occasionally eating out).

It feels like we aren't getting out of debt however.  We'll make a $200 payment to an account that'll return $150 in interest and fees, and the only thing we seem to be making progress on is our mortgage.

We aren't people who buy stuff.  We aren't driving flashy cars, and I think we live in a reasonable house for the amount of money we make.  I have a long commute, so I spend a little more on gas.  I feel like we're saving money for our retirement (stock, RSP's, pension, etc), but some months it gets a little stressful and there is a cost I'm willing to pay to get rid of this stress.

Refinancing the house will allow us to get much smaller payments, which we'll continue to stick to the same debt repayment plan, but it'll also allow us to continue saving when we have a child (possibly later on this year).  I don't like having my parents as plan B's in terms of money lending and think we make enough to stand on our own two feet.

Sorry for the long post, but is there something that I haven't considered?  I know paying off the highest interest loans is the best strategy, but given our current budget what's the best way to pay this off the fastest?  Should I leverage my home equity?",finance,1431551331

personalfinance,(Arizona &amp; Oregon) Consequences of cosigning brother's federal student loan?,"EDIT TO ADD: This is a [PLUS loan](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/faqs.action) for graduate/professional students, which seems to require either good credit history or a qualified endorser.

EDIT 2: Problem solved, thanks for your input. I'm going to refuse to cosign, and my mom is going to give me the money to offer him as a ""personal loan"" instead. If he pays me back, I'll pay her, and that's that. If he doesn't pay me back, she considers the money a gift anyway, and we both know not to loan him money in the future.
---
First, I didn't notice information in the Wiki or FAQ that would be immediately relevant, but could have missed something -- definitely feel free to link any helpful information if you know of them!

Now, on to my issue: I am stably employed in Arizona. My husband and I have great credit. My brother was accepted to law school in Oregon, and he just wrote me asking for me to be the ""endorser"" (which seems to mean cosigner) on a $3300 federal PLUS loan for him to attend law school. He said he can't get this loan on his own because he was overpaid $1200 in unemployment benefits in 2009 and just now found out about it, and that once he pays this money back, he'll be able to get future loans on his own. He says he anticipates getting some money from the GI Bill (I think) next year with which he will pay back this loan.

I know children normally ask their parents to cosign for loans, but my brother refuses to talk to either of our parents, so he asked me instead. I also understand that I would be responsible for paying this debt if he couldn't/wouldn't pay it for some reason.

Here's my question (well, two of them really): 

(1) How likely is it that a single credit issue, $1200 overpayment of unemployment benefits, has hurt his credit enough to prevent him getting a $3300 federal student loan? Does he likely have other credit issues that are concerning? 

(2) Say I want to buy a house/car/other large purchase before this loan is repaid. How much is being a cosigner for my brother's loan likely to hurt my ability to get a larger loan myself?

I'll be happy to provide other details if needed. Thanks for any comments you might have!",finance,1431552953
personalfinance,It's been 4 months and the IRS still hasn't giving me my tax refund. Any idea what the hold up could be?,"I filed my tax return using Tax Act at the end of January and my federal tax refund is a little over $1700. 

I never heard anything about it until I received a letter in the middle of March that told me to verify my identity online. I did that then never heard from them again so I called the IRS at the end of March and was told that it hadn't been verified so the rep went ahead and did it then. 

Another month goes by and I hear nothing from them so I called at the end of April only to be told that there is nothing that can be done until 60 days since the date they initially sent me the letter passed. So I wait until that date passed (last week) and called again. Now they want me to wait another 30 days before an IRS rep calls me or sends me another letter. 

What is going on? None of the representatives I've spoken to can give an answer to why my refund is being withheld. There is nothing out of the ordinary on my return. I still received my state tax refund back in March after originally verifying my identity.

personalfinance,Grad School/Part-Time Work/Debt,"Hello,

I wanted to use a throw away so I could speak freely about my situation, as it is something that I feel some shame about. Around two years ago I went through a divorce that really impacted my finances and ended up with a leased car (terrible decision I know). In getting out of that position and financing a car I ended up with a loan worth more than the car (loan is for 18,000 car is worth 14,000). 

I am currently attending grad school full-time so my ability to obtain more income is impacted and I've been looking for ways to reduce my expenses. The amount I'm paying on this loan is $350 and I'm seeking to reduce this. I applied for refinancing through the bank but got turned down. 

One option I was thinking about was selling the car for the most I could get for it and taking two loans out:

1. For the difference on the current loan I'm paying
2. For the new reduced cost car that I locate. 

I'm assuming by my research that my interest rate would be a little higher than what I'm paying now but I have a great FICO score (800) and I'm looking to do this in a way that makes the most sense. If I found a car for around $6000-9000 and another loan for $5000 (for the rest of the balance on the old car) my monthly payment by my math would still be lower. What does PF think of this? Worse choice of my life? Ideas on ways I could do this differently?

personalfinance,"(M)39 vet, homeless for three years, just starting to get life together. No idea where to start.","Hey guys, just discovered this subreddit and made an account for it.  I've been dealing with some shit that belongs in /r/offmychest and /r/veterans more than this sub, but I need you guys' advice.  So I'll summarize.    
    
Spent most of my life in service, deployed 7 times from 1998 to 2012, and was utterly committed to my job and what I felt my duty was.  Got injured in service making my last deployment into my final deployment.  Had some pretty complicated PTSD and physical trauma/damage that ended up costing me my entire life.  Ended up homeless with nothing, lived in my car and racked up about a 12k credit card bill using it to feed myself.    Committed suicide in dec last year.    Survived and was finally directed to the treatment I needed to get my head back together.  Had some surgeries that have left me with some pretty significant physical disabilities, and that limits what I can do.  With the assistance of a few pretty incredible people that found me in the hospital, I've been able to get a disability claim filed and processed that puts me at 70/100% disability.  This means that the VA under rated my physical disabilities because the don't want to pay it off, but can't wiggle out of the other stuff so I fall under 70% disabled with 100% unemployable status.  This brings me to present.    
    
Now that I've stabilized and have a stable place to live, I have to start thinking about what comes next, plan for some kind of future.  I'm not allowed to work, or the VA cuts my disability, but only make about 2930 a month.  I found a house to rent that costs me 750 a month with a few extra bedrooms, which I use to help other OEF/OIF vets trying to transition out of homelessness and get their lives together, but it's hard to keep the place running.  I'm on food stamps which makes it a little easier to keep every one fed, but we still only kinda barely make it.    
    
Now that things are evening out some, I need some advice about how to earn extra income without tripping my disability limit (I think I'm allowed to make an extra 1000 a month) and plan for a future.  I'm passionate about helping these guys and want to keep doing that, but I need to find a way to afford it better.  I have all kinds of questions, but no idea where to begin asking them.  If any of you have any experience or advice, I'm eager to hear it.

gaming,Story Time in Day Z,"So, I got the game because my brother had it and I played the mod before. I haven't played much since, but I found this post I made on the STEAM forums a long time ago and thought I would share.

1st Spawn
Sort of getting the controls down and trying to remember what they used to be in the Day Z mod that I played about two years ago. They're mostly similar, but still had a bit of bugs to deal with. Ultimately, I got my style down. Move slow, shift to jog, double W tap for sprint.

I find a shovel in an Industrial area by some railroad tracks. I'm still getting used to the use of 3rd and 1st person cameras. Out of NO WHERE some guy that looked like my twin brother comes at my with a knife screaming. I had a shovel that I didn't completely know what to do with. Ultimately, I died. But, the last thing I saw before I blacked out was blood just pouring off the idiot. I am content in knowing he will soon die after I am gone.

2nd Spawn
I manage to get a little bit further this time with the general state of affairs. I'm wondering around and finding stuff that I have no clue how to use. I've gotten myself a Baseball bat and a sweet hat. I look like a real shit kicker at this point. No guns, no food, and no water unfortunately. I run into a few zombies, learn that you can't out run them, and learn that 3rd person melee mode is shit when you're trying to land headshots. Luckily, I don't get murdered by them before I figure this out and begin using 1st Person to really WHACK them in the head. Needless to say, the terror in me is real when they go down I am sitting there bashing their head in over and over again JUST to make sure they don't get back up (which they did on me a few times).

I am bleeding, out of breathe from fighting two zombies, and it's raining. The world is gray and dreary. I enter a house and go prone to try and let my guy rest and just hope that it's possible for bleeding to stop naturally in the game. I black out shortly after, and then thirty seconds later die. Oh well, at least I went out like a champ.

Final spawn within the hour
I spawn in a place I somewhat recognize from the DayZ mod. I know there are some roadside diners that have two floors that often times have loot. There's also extra buildings added in from what I remember. I feel comfortably at this point with movement and have found my niche that works for me. I'm also confident in my melee weapon abilities.

I luck out and find a splitting axe, which, I ended up using twice on two zombies. I'm a bit more skilled now and I quickly switch to first person and drop them with a hit to the head quickly. I still have the crazed terror as I still find myself bashing their heads in over and over just to make sure they don't get up.

I've found a yellow raincoat. Not my best choice of colors in a hopeless atmosphere, but it says it's suppose to protect me from the rain.. and it seems to rain ALOT. I find a rifle with no bullets, but find out I can store it on my back. I'm okay with this as it could come handy later. My pants are stuffed full of junk but I slowly replace them with bits of food and even a bandage! I'm getting the hang of things at this point, but the intensity is increasing the more helpful stuff I find. It's as if the game knows I am making progress and I can almost hear the sniffing of bandits as they try to find where that fresh noob smell is coming from.

I'm still picking through the diners and come across a medkit on the second floor; I'm ecstatic. It has bandages and a whole lot of stuff dealing with blood, syringes, and IV's that I have no idea how to use. I'm sitting there with an Axe in my hand just poking around trying to figure out how to fill the blood bag with my own blood so I can use it later. This involves dropping the syringe with my blood in it, picking it up, then dropping it again.

I'm sitting there toiling around with the medkit stuff when out the corner of my eye a man steps into the doorway. He's got black sunglasses on, a black jacket and some cargo pants. He's got two things on his back I can't quite make out. I freak out and move my guy against the wall. I don't know what to do at this point. I know it's kill or be killed, but I really didn't want to get into a fight!

I quickly tell him I'm friendly, and he hasn't pulled any weapons out so I'm assuming the window of peace has yet closed. Before I give him a chance to make a decision I quickly tell him I just got the game, and am really new to DayZ. I was trying to play the noob card, and I was playing it hard at this point. If I was in his shoes it would be impossible for me to murder... well.. me!

After I let him know I'm new I put away my Axe as an act of good will and stand up straight. He comes into the room to chat with me. I don't let the conversation die down- I don't want to give him a chance to decide I'm easy prey! So, I start asking him questions about using the medkit I had just found. So here's two guys voice chatting about blood and game mechanics.

He then tells me to drop the medkit. Now, he followed up with this statement after answering a question but I could tell something was a bit more forceful, a bit more demanding in his voice. I take a few seconds to consider my options but quickly decide that the medkit isn't worth losing my precious yellow raincoat and ammo-less rifle. I drop it. He picks it up and then tells me that I am missing some component. At this point he's standing right in front of me.

As soon as he says this he pulls out his axe, pauses a full second, then says ""The first thing to learn in Day Z is to not trust anyone"" and immediately swings at me. I make a quick lunge to the left to avoid it but he still manages to clip me. I'm not sure where, but the sound of it connecting wasn't something I liked very much.

I'm in over drive mode at this point. It's fight or fly at this moment. For some reason, and I don't know why, my instant reaction to being hit by this stranger I just met wasn't to run out of the room but to fight! In the middle of my quick dodge to the left that probably saved my head I was pulling out my own axe.

I don't hesitate. I don't say a word to him. There is nothing but pure, intense, focus. I surprise him with how quickly I reacted as he sort of paused just long enough for me to hit spacebar and ready my axe. I come in hard and fast and crack a direct hit to his neck. This shakes him awake as he rears his own axe back and swings at me. I can hear it connect, and he is amping up his movements to avoid my own swings. I'm trying not to lose control of my movements and try to stay focused on my footwork as well as my aiming. There's a table in the middle of this small room that both of us are bumping into, I quickly compensate.

It's an all out brawl. Halfway through the fight he seems to regain his composure and starts trying to time his swings with our footwork... I notice this and quickly try to respond in kind. At this point he's in my ballfield now. He's not just messing with a Day Z noob, but a champion rock fighter from RUST. But, by no means am I confident at this point. It's like fighting a zombie that learns your moves and tries to murder you with new tricks each time. I keep my composure and let him make mistakes. I'm watching his footwork and timing his swings to come after I step back from swinging my own axe. I'm landing hits, he's landing hits, and my screen is quickly becoming barely manageable by how gray scale everything was becoming. I can barely tell the difference between him and the table at this point; I feel like I'm fighting blind and am swinging at any movement just hoping to hit.

Finally, I drop back quickly as his axe goes right in front of my screen only to follow up with a crack to his chin. He falls. All I can hear is the breathing of my character and see a dark, humanoid outline in the grayness of the floor below me. I only pause in shock that he is not standing, and was knocked unconscious. I know he may still get up and I immediately crouch down and begin hacking away at his head. I don't stop swinging for a good twenty seconds as I am terrified that he'll magically get back up and finish me off. I can see blood squirting out from the bottom of my screen where I am bleeding from the wounds he gave me.

Soon as I felt like he wouldn't be getting up anytime soon I quickly went through his belongings to pull MY hard earned medkit out. I bandage myself and just sit there staring at the gray, dark outline of his dead body. My heart is pumping and I am losing my shit in real life. I have a sudden urge to talk shit to this guy but there's no text chat that I know of and I never knew his Steam name... he was just some random stranger that I put my trust into that tried to murder me in cold blood.

I happily go through his stuff just absolutely thrilled with the new additions to my own gear. I grab his black aviators and put them on my character and realize that maybe.. just maybe.. I'm not such a noob after all.",technology,1431559198

Looking at other options.,"Long story short: parents think it's a good idea to commit credit card fraud and puts a bunch of credit cards on my USAA account (linked to car insurance). I file police report. Warrant issued. 

Back in November I flagged the account. I SPECIFICALLY requested a passphrase in case I need to unlock the account. Reprensentative says she will put it on. 

Come January, USAA did not send me my proof of insurance that I requested so I tried to unflag my account. EVERYTIME I called them from January to march, they said the fraud department would call me back. Never did.

Come May, I am completely fed up (at this point I have called them six times.) I call them and now they want a phone verification instead of a passphrase. The person who was supposed to write down the passphrase never did. I contacted the supervisor and he said the authentication department would contact me in 48 hours. Of course that doesn't happen. 

I call today and they give me the same story. Contact Authentication department. The supervisor I talked to gives me a direct line to the Authentication department. Guess what? That wasn't the right direct line, instead it's the Fraud Department. The fraud department links me back to the security department. Guess what? They say they will file paperwork for the authentication department to contact me and give me a direct line to the fraud department. They say that they can transfer me over but I refused, saying that they were the ones who directed me to the security department in the first place.

personalfinance,How I invest in Lending Club,"I originally posted this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/35rjnp/lendingclubcom_good_idea_or_bad_idea_to_invest/cr8jn5l?context=3). Your mileage may vary so don't take my word for any of this, do your own research and figure out what works for you if you.  
.  
Currently, I have 104 notes, that are live (so excluding fully paid and not yet issued notes). I have $25 in each note ($2600 total) and they are all current right now. My Net Annual Return is 10.85%. As a caveat, I should note that they are all fairly young notes so that **will** change in the future.   

 I use two methods to determine what notes are purchased through the automated investment system:  

* First, is the grade distribution, which the system unfortunately does not let you override, even though my filter is set in a way that largely makes it irrelevant (my filter is strict enough to pretty much eliminate all D,E,F, and G notes)  
  Because I can't use my filter to set distribution I have had to constantly tweak my percentages to allow me to get new notes that fit my criteria as they come available. That admittedly sidesteps/weakens the diversification element achieved through LC's rating system; however, I have confidence in my filter so I feel comfortable doing so. I would only recommend tweaking your ratings constantly if you know the risk and know what you are doing.  
  
 * My current distribution of note grades is set to:   
 * A: 17%
 * B: 40%
 * C: 43%  

* Secondly, is my filter. I'm just going to go down the list and write out how I have it set with brief footnotes. Any settings that I don't mention are unchecked if they're checkmark boxes or otherwise left at their default (unless it's something I obviously forgot, in which case call me on it).  
.  
.  

* Initial listing status: Both    

&gt; Unless you are investing a fantastical amount of money, you aren't going to be investing in whole loans, and even then, it's probably not advisable from a diversification standpoint. I gather that whole loan notes are fairly uncommon anyway.  

 * Months since last record: 60  
&gt; Public records are things like bankruptcies and defaults. Setting this high weeds out the loans from people shown to be a bad bet when previously being given credit.  

 * Inquiries in the last 6 months: 5    
&gt; Certain actions, such as looking into getting a new car loan, credit card, or mortgage can shoot this number right up since it counts hard inquiries (such as inquiries to get a new line of credit or increase an existing line of credit). If you set this too low then you will remove a whole bunch of otherwise good loans; however, you don't want people who are just racking up credit and burning through it.  

 * Monthly income: 0 to &gt; 20,000  
&gt; Might be a little controversial, but income != ability to repay, especially when other filters are in place to limit how much credit the borrower has and is using at a time. This is another slightly redundant filter because of the other filters and the affect on the number of available loans should be measured before raising this too much.   

 * Total credit lines: 10 maximum  
&gt; See the open credit lines section before for more on this, but this is to catch people who quickly open and close credit lines. There can be legitimate reasons for this being high, especially since accounts stay on the report for 7 years + 180 days (delinquent and collected accounts) or 10 years (accounts closed in good standing), but too many credit lines on the credit report is a major red flag for me.

 * Listing expires in: Any  
&gt; IMO not a relevant factor  

 * Loan purpose: Consolidate debt 
&gt; Unlike other loan types this loan is not increasing the borrower's debt, nor does it increase their spending. In fact, quite the opposite. Everything I have read has led me to believe that this is the the lowest risk loan type to invest in.  

 * Credit score: 660 to 850   
&gt; I tried tweaking this, and I may again at some point, but all increasing it did was exclude most if not all of the possible loans. Credit score also lags behind reality, as in, by the time that someone's credit score is hit, they've already been a risk, hurt their credit from that risk, and tried to move on. Along with the fact that I'm doing debt consolidation loans, using other factors such as public records, inquiries, number of credit lines, , derogatories, and utilization to weed people out seems to work better.  


 * Public records: exlude loans with public records   
&gt; May or may not be redundant with months since last public record, depending on public records falling off of credit reports. This is pretty much a fail safe to stop loans from getting through with older bankruptcies or defaults that are still on the borrower's record.  

 * Funding progress: 0%  
&gt; This is **minimum** funding percentage. Because of the other checks in my filter, plus the checks that Lending Club has in place before a loan is issued, I don't mind being one of the first people in on a loan. I don't have a benchmark to compare with, but a fairly high percentage of loans that I fund get issued. That's a good thing IMO because it means that Lending Club is weeding out, for whatever reason, many loans and the consensus of other users (through automated investing and/or filters and/or manually selecting loans) works to each lender's advantage too.

 * Min length of employment: 5 years   
&gt;  Ask pretty much anyone who extends credit, this is a biggie because it shows income stability and it lends itself to the idea that the person, barring some unforeseen event, will be bringing in money to pay back the loan  

 * Exclude relisted loans: exclude relisted  
&gt; Don't want the returns, if a loan has been rejected then I'm not interested. I'm not sure what constitutes a relist to Lending Club so it's possible that this catches some loans that were relisted for a typo or some other innocuous reason.  

 * Major derogratory: &gt; 60  
&gt; This is months since the last major derogatory mark (which seems to be 90 or more days over due) on the borrower's credit report.  

 * Open credit lines: 0 to 10  
&gt; Per the total credit lines option, more lines of credit = more risk and a higher chance that yours will be the bill that's put off or not paid.  Looking at the statistics on CreditKarma, a lot of people have a large number of credit lines open (you actually get a slight credit boost from having more credit open, as long as your utilization is good and you pay on time). This is something I wish could be tweaked down, but doing so pretty much kills the number of loans.  

 * Location state: all  
&gt; IMO, not particularly relevant to anything. Even if there was a sudden wave of defaults in one state, it would be too late at that point and not investing in that state's loans would have minimal to no effect.  

 * Max loan amount up to: 35,000  
&gt; IMO, not relevant because delinquincies, credit balance, and utilization, among other factors, negate the slightly higher risk from bigger loans.  

 * Delinquincies (last 2 yrs): 0   
&gt; Should be pretty self explanatory, probably redundant with derogatory marks and records filters.  

 * Revolving credit balance: less than $50,000  
&gt; Credit without a fixed rate repayment, so this doesn't include car loans or mortgages but it does include credit cards and home equity credit. This is a big one and I could probably tighten it up even more.  

 * Home ownership: any  
&gt; I tried tweaking this, it just caused problems. In this day and age, many people rent by choice because it makes more economical sense so there isn't necessarily a correlation between renting and higher risk.  

 * Exclude loans invested in: √  
&gt; Self explanatory, I invest $25 per loan for a reason so I don't want to invest in the same loan twice.  

 * Max debt-to-income ratio: 30%  
&gt; Another one I tried to tweak down with various consequences. More debt = more risk, yet again so it's good to get people who are bringing in more income than they have debt. Obviously this doesn't equal free income, because the borrower can still be spending a lot of their income on month to month expenses, but it means they aren't taking on excessive debt.  
  
 * Loan term: 36 month  
&gt; This is a personal choice based entirely on what I feel comfortable with. I've thought about dabbling in 60 month loans, but a shorter loan means fewer payments to start with for the borrower (allowing them hopefully a greater chance to pay off early) and a shorter time for them to potentially get into trouble.  

 * Months since last delinquency: 60 months or more  
&gt; Per the above related items, I don't want anything to do with borrowers who have shown themselves to be credit risks in recent history. Since Lending Club gives us no better way to determine if the borrower is still a credit risk, it is best not to take the chance that they are still having issues.  

 * Interest rate: all  
&gt; Irrelevant due to the other criteria pretty much excluding D and lower loans. I kept my distribution settings to allow D loans when I first started and zero came up as meeting my filter criteria so I'm reasonably sure that this isn't an issue.  

 * Earliest credit line: 10 years or more  
&gt; In conjunction with the rest of the history based filters, this is using the very limited tools Lending Club makes available to get a picture of the person's credit history. It's tough to get comfortable with a person being a credit risk or not based on a short credit history.  

 * Collections excluding medical: 0  
&gt;  Again, eliminating people with credit issues on their account.  

 * Revolving balance utilization: any  
&gt; I had to double check this because I was sure I had it set to something but if I remember correctly, from my testing it was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I have debt to income and other filters that catch high utilization borrowers. I will be revisiting this one though.",finance,1431574563
investing,How I invest in Lending Club (x-post /r/personalfinance),"I originally posted this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/35rjnp/lendingclubcom_good_idea_or_bad_idea_to_invest/cr8jn5l?context=3). Your mileage may vary so don't take my word for any of this, do your own research and figure out what works for you if you.  
.  
Currently, I have 104 notes, that are live (so excluding fully paid and not yet issued notes). I have $25 in each note ($2600 total) and they are all current right now. My Net Annual Return is 10.85%. As a caveat, I should note that they are all fairly young notes so that **will** change in the future.   

 I use two methods to determine what notes are purchased through the automated investment system:  

* First, is the grade distribution, which the system unfortunately does not let you override, even though my filter is set in a way that largely makes it irrelevant (my filter is strict enough to pretty much eliminate all D,E,F, and G notes)  
  Because I can't use my filter to set distribution I have had to constantly tweak my percentages to allow me to get new notes that fit my criteria as they come available. That admittedly sidesteps/weakens the diversification element achieved through LC's rating system; however, I have confidence in my filter so I feel comfortable doing so. I would only recommend tweaking your ratings constantly if you know the risk and know what you are doing.  
  
 * My current distribution of note grades is set to:   
 * A: 17%
 * B: 40%
 * C: 43%  

* Secondly, is my filter. I'm just going to go down the list and write out how I have it set with brief footnotes. Any settings that I don't mention are unchecked if they're checkmark boxes or otherwise left at their default (unless it's something I obviously forgot, in which case call me on it).  
.  
.  

* Initial listing status: Both    

&gt; Unless you are investing a fantastical amount of money, you aren't going to be investing in whole loans, and even then, it's probably not advisable from a diversification standpoint. I gather that whole loan notes are fairly uncommon anyway.  

 * Months since last record: 60  
&gt; Public records are things like bankruptcies and defaults. Setting this high weeds out the loans from people shown to be a bad bet when previously being given credit.  

 * Inquiries in the last 6 months: 5    
&gt; Certain actions, such as looking into getting a new car loan, credit card, or mortgage can shoot this number right up since it counts hard inquiries (such as inquiries to get a new line of credit or increase an existing line of credit). If you set this too low then you will remove a whole bunch of otherwise good loans; however, you don't want people who are just racking up credit and burning through it.  

 * Monthly income: 0 to &gt; 20,000  
&gt; Might be a little controversial, but income != ability to repay, especially when other filters are in place to limit how much credit the borrower has and is using at a time. This is another slightly redundant filter because of the other filters and the affect on the number of available loans should be measured before raising this too much.   

 * Total credit lines: 10 maximum  
&gt; See the open credit lines section before for more on this, but this is to catch people who quickly open and close credit lines. There can be legitimate reasons for this being high, especially since accounts stay on the report for 7 years + 180 days (delinquent and collected accounts) or 10 years (accounts closed in good standing), but too many credit lines on the credit report is a major red flag for me.

 * Listing expires in: Any  
&gt; IMO not a relevant factor  

 * Loan purpose: Consolidate debt 
&gt; Unlike other loan types this loan is not increasing the borrower's debt, nor does it increase their spending. In fact, quite the opposite. Everything I have read has led me to believe that this is the the lowest risk loan type to invest in.  

 * Credit score: 660 to 850   
&gt; I tried tweaking this, and I may again at some point, but all increasing it did was exclude most if not all of the possible loans. Credit score also lags behind reality, as in, by the time that someone's credit score is hit, they've already been a risk, hurt their credit from that risk, and tried to move on. Along with the fact that I'm doing debt consolidation loans, using other factors such as public records, inquiries, number of credit lines, , derogatories, and utilization to weed people out seems to work better.  


 * Public records: exlude loans with public records   
&gt; May or may not be redundant with months since last public record, depending on public records falling off of credit reports. This is pretty much a fail safe to stop loans from getting through with older bankruptcies or defaults that are still on the borrower's record.  

 * Funding progress: 0%  
&gt; This is **minimum** funding percentage. Because of the other checks in my filter, plus the checks that Lending Club has in place before a loan is issued, I don't mind being one of the first people in on a loan. I don't have a benchmark to compare with, but a fairly high percentage of loans that I fund get issued. That's a good thing IMO because it means that Lending Club is weeding out, for whatever reason, many loans and the consensus of other users (through automated investing and/or filters and/or manually selecting loans) works to each lender's advantage too.

Is this an advantage of bond funds over individual bonds?,"For IL, for example, The tax form starts with the AGI from the Federal form, which includes interest income and ordinary dividends.  There is no place to add back qualified dividends.

If I held individual bonds, though, that would be ordinary interest, right?  So, owning a bond fund has the advantage of not being taxed by the state, among its other virtues.  Is this the correct understanding?

So then, regarding the ordinary dividends, should I be able to calculate the portion of the ordinary dividends that were from bonds that are exempt from state tax, like US Treasury bonds, and deduct that?

There is a section where you deduct interest from such exempt bonds.  Perhaps it would be a trivial amount of savings, but curious if I would be entitled to do so.",finance,1431589884

    Hey everyone,

    This is my first post in reddit, and I’ve really enjoyed the posts here in r/personalfinance. I figured I could use your collective help. I’ve saved some money over the years but also made some ill-thought financial decisions I’m trying to fix. I am 27.

    So I’m about to get off of my deployment, leave military service, and start studying at a top ten business school in August. After school I should expect to make $120K to $135K based upon median outcomes for my school. Ideally, before school starts I’d like to be credit card debt-free, have the house sold off (or rented but preferably sold off), and still live comfortably enough to have money saved each year for investments and travel. My two biggest worries are my house not selling and whether I should take out my full loan eligibility to give myself a cushion during the year just in case of an emergency.

    I bought my home in the East Coast in 2011. It was a fixer-upper, and I thought I could do all the repairs myself. Bad decision. I ended up fleeced by two contractors, before finally finding a good one and an honest realtor. I then took the HELOC out to do a major kitchen renovation (as well as finish all the work the others had done shoddily while I was deployed the first time). I then put the house on the market last year for a slightly lower price, but it didn’t sell and the property manager I looked at wouldn’t take it as a rental because it “needed more work.” This past year, I finally decided to take out another loan to do “touch-up” work that turned into an extra $5K expense because of a burst pipe this past winter. The house should go on the market by the end of the month. I can’t wait to get this off my hands.

    Even if it doesn’t sell, I’ll probably be able to rent it out this time around for about $1500/month. Still in a worst-case scenario, it could take a big chunk out of my living allowance.

    So with my next 7 paychecks and an uncertain housing situation in July (apartment lease runs out, currently looking for a willing couch before I move across country in August), I’d like to knock out my credit cards before school starts and pay cash for the tuition soon-to-be owed. However, would it be wiser to just to apply for the full federal student loan and have that as a cushion? Should I dip into my mutual funds to pay the tuition balance or the credit cards? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1431611729

personalfinance,I put myself into $65k of Credit Card Debt for a Good Reason,"I love PF! I read every article and store tidbits of information in my memory for future use. This thread will have NO similarity to anything else you read here. I literally put myself into debt on purpose. I do not recommend anyone follow my lead without proper understanding.

To start off, I was 25 when I began this ""project"" and I live in New York in a very high cost of living area. I was working for a small company making $800 per week before taxes. I have a Master's degree in Business Management but couldn't find a job after graduation (damn economy). I had no wealth and maybe $2,000 saved up in my bank account. From the age of 18 I applied for credit cards to build credit. I had an AmEx (no ""limit""), State Farm Visa ($7,500 limit), Chase Visa ($15,000 limit), and PayPal Visa ($4,500 limit). I used every card every month and paid them off immediately. I would charge my every day purchases, wait for the statement and pay them in full. The interest rates were around 18%-22%. 

A friend of mine told me he was going to purchase a house to fix up and sell for a profit. The house would cost him $335,000 and it would need $100,000 in work. He estimated it would sell for $650,000 and it would take 1 year to sell. He got an FHA mortgage for 95% of the purchase price ($318,250) and put down the remainder in cash ($16,750). He had another $40,000 in cash to do the renovations but that wasn't enough. I worked out a deal with him, I would partner with him on this house flip and I would take 33% of the profit. He said it was a deal!

I applied for 3 credit cards in 1 day. I had a 760 credit score and absolutely no debt. All of my applications said pending and I called the second look line for each card and after a few questions I was approved for: Chase Freedom ($24,000) Chase Ink Cash ($7,500) and Discover It ($10,000). I now have a total of $68,500 in available credit plus my American Express. 

Over six months, my friend charged every house expense he could on the credit cards. He had to pay many things using his cash but most of the materials and contractors took credit. He quickly racked up $65,000 worth of charges on my cards. The monthly payments came due - they started at $25 each card and by the end of the project they ranged from $150-$400 based on the balance and interest. The deal was my friend would make the minimum payments from his cash and he would pay the mortgage. 

Fast forward to now, 11 months later - My credit score is now 610. My utilization is 95% but all of my payments have been on time. We are scheduled to close on the sale of the house tomorrow for $655,000. After closing costs and expenses, I will make around 1.5x my annual salary without actually investing any of my own cash. Things could go wrong in the next 24 hours and the economy could tank and I would have to file bankruptcy, but lets hope that doesn't happen. 

By 4pm tomorrow, I will pay off $65,000 worth of debt and will hopefully be depositing a whole bunch of money into my bank account. I am going to keep my eye on my credit karma profile to see how all of this will affect my credit score. 

I just want to point out that this was a close friend of mine. We had a contract drawn up by an attorney (cost him $500) which outlined my ownership of the house (10%) and my share of the profit upon sale (33%). This was an investment - with investments there are risks. I was fully aware of the risks/reward before embarking on this adventure. I was very anxious throughout the whole process seeing my credit balances reach 100% of their limits. 

I posted this in PF rather than business because I want to show you that credit can be a good thing. So many people get themselves into trouble with their credit and many think that credit cards are the devil. You can use your credit cards as tools especially when so many banks offer 0% introductory rates. 

My tip to walk away with - don't apply for 0% cards when you don't need them. Apply to get bonus points and to get higher limits. If you are ever going to need a bunch of credit and you have time to anticipate it, then apply for the 0% cards such as Chase Freedom (15 months) or Discover It (14 months).",finance,1431614106

I feel as though I am paying too much for a car. My other monthly expenses add up to $1331 (Rent, Utilities, etc.) and I bring in $3215.82/month after-taxes in income so I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, but still am not saving as much as I should.

My credit score is around 750-760 last time I checked. I agreed to a higher interest rate originally because I had a lack of credit history, but with a year of on time payments I should be able to get a better rate. 

I though about refinancing but don't want to stretch out the term on my loan. I've looked into different cars myself, but I'm having trouble finding a balance between cost and the features that I need. I live in a part of the US that has bad weather in the winter months, so 4WD is a must. I would also like to save on gas, so the higher the mpg the better. I would ideally like a PHEV as I park in a lot with an electric car charger, but its appears that the cars may be too expensive with 4WD. Hybrid car sounds like a good option. It would be ideal to have the car cost less than $15k and be used but no more than 2 years old.

Any suggestions?",finance,1431615451

personalfinance,I need to save $20k in 15 months and need thoughts/ideas on cutting my budget.,"Wall of text to come, apologies. 


I am currently working 37.5 hours/week and earning $15/hr. After taxes, I make around $1900/month. I am a single mom to a school age child and live with my parents rent-free, and I get $200/month in child support which goes directly into a separate savings account for my kid that I don't touch. I have a small car loan of about $6k that I am paying off as quickly as I can, other than that I have no credit card debt, no student loan debt, no debt of any kind. The rest of my budget is laid out a bit further down.


I'm pretty embarrassed about the fact that I'm 25 and still living with my parents and I've come to the realization that if I ever want to get anywhere in my life, I need to go back to school and get a degree in something useful. I'm hoping to go to nursing school next September. I will need to quit my job to devote my time to nursing school, and I really want to make sure I have enough money saved up to pay my gas/food/phone bill/kid expenses/car repairs and insurance/life insurance while I'm in school. I think those are my most essential expenses. I've left health insurance off because my state does the Obamacare thing and I'm pretty sure I'll qualify for very low cost or free healthcare once I become a student. I've averaged out my spending in the areas I mentioned over the past 4 months (I only started tracking expenses budgeting 4 months ago so I don't have more long-term data) and it comes out to around $700/month. $700 times 24  = $16,800 so I'd ideally like to have AT LEAST that much saved up. 


I will also need to save up an additional $4k to pay the first year's worth of tuition/books that my estimated federal aid won't cover. 


Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think my first priority is that I need to pay off the car. I hate making payments on an item that depreciates so quickly and that could be wrecked at any time. I have a little less than $6k to go on it and really want it over with ASAP. I would sell it, but I live in a semi-rural area and it's basically required for me to get anywhere. I also need to pay around $1400 to take two nursing school pre-reqs online, so that's $7k I'll be spending in the next year just to prepare to get into school. 


My problem is figuring out where/what/how much to cut. I currently spend/save in the following categories:
FIXED MONTHLY SPENDING:
Health Insurance - $311
Gas - $125
Life Insurance - $33.00
Phone - $50
Entertainment - $7.99 (Netflix)
Groceries/Household - $200.00
School Lunch for Kid - $5.30
HBA - $20
Gym - $31.26

MONTHLY SAVINGS: 
Clothing - $50/mo
Car Insurance - $100/mo
Car Repairs/Maintenance - $50/mo
IRA - $100/mo
Saving for Nursing School - haven't designated yet
Emergency Savings - $100/mo
HSA (medical spending) - $100/mo
(My Kid's) Stuff - $200/mo
Haircut - $14/mo 
Car Payment - $300-$400/mo
Nursing Pre-Reqs Saving - $50/mo


I just don't know what categories to stop saving in (aside from the obvious clothes and haircut categories) and what categories I could stand to keep saving in but just not save as much? This is very confusing and I'm very discouraged because in order to save up $20k in 15 months I'd need to save $1300/month which leaves me with $600 to live on, 100% of which is immediately gobbled up by health insurance and car payments leaving me nothing to put in the rest of my savings categories/pay my regular bills with.",finance,1431617693

*      Only income is Social Security and a small retirement  totaling about $1500/mo.
*      Expenses of $1400/mo. not including CC payments, nothing extravagant.
*      No chance of working or increasing income, expenses are home, insurance, car and food.

I have called the credit card companies, explained the situation and they only offer a lower interest rate that ""will get him back to paying the minimum payments"". He can't pay them. He would like to sell his condo and pay off the cards and buy a cheaper place but that won't be immediate or a sure thing. We have been advised by some to just stop paying the cards and wait for a collection agency to settle for a lesser amount. Of course this would hurt his credit (currently at 580) but are there other things I am missing? My Uncle is very worried and frankly can't take much more stress from this debt.

I had a steady income stream and bought items to a value that I had the ability to pay back in monthly installments. However my personal financial situation has changed for the worse as i am now a full time carer for my mum. 

I've been trying to keep up with payments but they have gotten on top of me and now the first company has put the bill through to collections and they wan't a minimum payment of £279.59 and they want it by the 22nd of may. The total debt for that company has risen to £873.63 due to various late fees and extra charges. The second company has not yet put my account into collections but the total owed is £451.53.

 I have tried to set up payment plans in the past but due to being on a very limited income as a carer i was unable to keep up with all of my obligations and fell behind. This has put me in the position where the first company is unwilling to negotiate a new monthly payment plan. 

I have not told my mum about the situation because i am worried about the effect that the stress will put on her already fragile health.

I have applied for loans and credit cards to try and spread the cost out and give myself more time to make payments but my credit score is not high enough to be approved by most of the large banks.

personalfinance,"25M, looking for budget feedback","Hello everyone, I started my first full time job about two months ago and now that I've had a few months of expenses I'd like to see what you all think of my budget and ways to do better. I've been lurking in /r/personalfinance since I started looking for work, so I also just want to contribute my information to the community that I've learned from. I know I'm in a good position, but I don't really know what to be doing with the cash I have left over each month.

Job pays 74K per year with 5-10K bonus. I have health/life/disability insurance through the company, and it gets deducted from my paycheck. Thanks to PF's advice, I'm contributing 21% of my income to my 401k each month. The company matches 9%, making my effective savings rate 30% of my income. Here is the first question: should I be saving less in the 401k each month to finance a Roth IRA?

After all that, my monthly budget is as follows:

* Take home pay: 3,000
* Rent: 710 (Includes water)
* Phone: 50
* Electric: 35
* Guitar lessons: 80
* Car Insurance: 80
* Groceries: 200
* Fuel: 125
* Spending Money: 50
* Restaurants: 100

This leaves me with about $1500 'left over' each month. More so these last two months because I'm not yet qualified for the 401k; tomorrow will be the first time it is deducted from my pay (bimonthly pay).

I moved cities for this job so I'm starting out with little but a bed and clothing, so over the past two months I've managed to spend close to $800 on kitchen supplies and household goods. I did splurge a bit on an awesome coffee kettle, but overall I researched my items and bought things that I believe will last most of my life. I can see spending another 300-500 on household items over the next couple of months but I have everything I need (and most of what I want) so I expect that number to drop off dramatically.

My other assets:

* Emergency fund: 10000
* Roth IRA: 7500
* Checking: 5500
* Savings: 25000
* Schwab: 24000
* Single-company investments: 16000

Normally I would be happy to have that portfolio, but the savings account and the single company investments were inherited from my father, who passed away several years ago. I hate thinking of them as assets because I don't want to feel like I've gained anything from his death. The Schwab account was from $1000 of stock given to me at birth - thank you reinvested dividends!

My next life change will be getting married about a year from now, assuming things continue to go well with my girlfriend and I. To be honest, I would feel pretty boring if I were to save more and more. I'm planning to fund my IRA with whatever bonus I get every year. If I do that, I'll be pushing 40% saved income! That's nothing to complain about! I was planning on consolidating all of my stocks into a Vanguard account as well, then moving the Roth to Vanguard to make the portfolio easier to manage.

After writing all this, I suppose a few obvious points would be to put some money towards a house down payment. And probably an engagement ring as well, though I was just planning on taking that from the savings account.

Yes, the monthly payment would be lower if I took the 10, 15, or 20 year loans, however, the interest rate offers are ridiculous.  I didn't even need to do the math to laugh at the insanity of this offer. 

Yes, you can get 0.50% off the interest rate if you both open a Citizens bank or credit account and allow autopay. 

Thank you, I'll stick with the current rates and keep my focus on those higher loans and higher interest rates.

Bitcoin,Exchanges using HD to prove proof of reserves and protect users.,"I believe HD wallets can really help both exchanges as well as their users. It can create proof of researves for every user without disclosing any other information about funds held, in total or other users. No ""outside auditor"" required.


An exchange can create an HD wallet on a per user basis. The xPub can be sent to the user. The user can monitor their own funds in real time.
Periodically funds are settled. (few times a day, once a day, whenever decided by the exchange) Settling would mean, on the blockchain, transfering funds between addresses to where they should be relative to the trades since the last settle. Pending sells go to your address, they are your coin until sold. Funds transfer can be lumped into one transaction, this would not overly strain the network, it would just be one huge transaction.
When you issue a withdrawl request, it can be processed after the next settling. 


We could also do something comparable, but in reverse. Allow people to short on your bitcoins without them ever leaving your wallet. Upload your (dedicated to this purpose) xPub to bitfinex (or any other exchange that allows shorting). Any transfer of coins to these addresses are sent with an nLockTime transaction. So if you want to allow a short on your coin for 30 days, nLockTime of 4320 blocks. When they see this transaction they can allow shorting of that many more coins. I believe you could even specify your requested interest rate with an opcode? Interest would be paid to the nLockTime'd address.

We already trust the exchange not to naked short in the background. We would still need that trust, but at least you would not need to also trust them with your coin. Those coins cant move for the specified amount of time, so thats the window for them to be ""borrowed.""",cryptocurrency,1431652134

personalfinance,"Recent graduate, confused about how much to save, how much to invest, and how much to put towards debt.","I graduated last weekend and will be working soon, taking home approximately $4k per month. I have approximately $20k in student loan debt, all federal loans and with interest rates at 5% or lower. I have about $3k in savings, and my expenses are about $500 per month. 

I'm pretty confused and stressed about the best way to allocate my income each month. I realize that I am very fortunate to have so little student loan debt and a steady income.

My first instinct was to throw everything at my student loan debt, but now I am leaning towards focusing more on contributing to a Roth IRA and just paying 150-200% of the minimum payment towards loans (minimum is ~$220) each month. This came from realizing that the interest rates on my loans are quite low (max 5%, as low as 3.4%), and that prioritizing investing would yield a higher  return than paying off my loans. FWIW, payments don't begin until November.

However, I also want to begin saving for a used car, and to just build up savings to move out and relocate eventually. 

I'm confused on the right way to allocate my income. I could go gung ho and pay off my loans very quickly, within about 6 months, leaving me with little savings or IRA contributions. I could also just make slightly above minimum payments and focusing on saving more. 

Given that my interest rates are low, is this the best strategy? How much of a priority should I give to $20k of low interest loans?",finance,1431653899

personalfinance,I hit my goal!!! now what?,"Hi all,

I have been on track to saving 6 months of living expenses for years. Had a couple of bumps in the road on the way but I have finally hit that glorious milestone about a month back.

A little about my wife and me:

We are in our low thirties

We purchased a house about 5 years ago 

my wife wants kids (not sure im ready financially)

We have 0 debt

The way I saved the money that I did was by opening 14 different accounts and assigning them names for every foreseeable expense that I had. Next, I over budgeted how much each of those accounts actually needed for me to live so they slowly built up to the point where they reached a predetermined cap.



Now I have money going over the cap after each paycheck is deposited and the extra is building up. My initial thought was to work on paying off the mortgage so that if the whole world went to hell I could at least own my house.



Now Im starting to think that if i refi from a 30 year fixed to a 15 year fixed rate loan I would up my monthly payment by around 200 dollars but shave 10 years off my loan. With an interest rate at about 3% for 15 years I think I should focus my extra money somewhere where I can beat that rate. 



What should I do with the excess that goes over the cap of my accounts? I have been lopping off the excess amount and putting it back into my main account just to sit there for now.



I definitely don't see myself living in the house I currently own forever. It was a starter home and I would like to make it a rental to help with some extra income. Would it be smart to take the excess each month and start throwing it into some index funds to at least try to keep up with inflation so when I go to buy a house I can have the initial money I started with and the potential interest? If the money took a hit in the market it would not be the end of me seeing as I have the 6 months of living expenses and an employer matched 401k at 11% already.

personalfinance,I am trying to get an auto loan for a car at the end of June. But when checking my reports/scores I am confused about the derogatory status of my deferred school loans?,"**TL;DR:** **I have 5 deferred Fed loans and 2 ""regular?"" school loans that are reporting as in collections and going into collections that are all reporting negatively on my credit reports. Is there anything besides paying on them that can be done to make these not on adverse accounts?
Besides that, currently my score on equifax is 622, and although I know that score is not my overall credit score,  I know it is possibly good for me. My loan counselor at my credit union who ran my equifax report, said I need a score of at least 640 to be approved for an auto loan.  Is there any way to raise my score up 20 points or more (overall I suppose not just on equifax) by the end of June?**



I have my report from Transunion (which I got from annualcreditreport) and Equifax (which I got for free from my bank). My Equifax report had a score of 622 (which is greatly improved from last time I checked at 543), but I know that is not the only score that is important for my FICO. My transunion report did not have a score that I saw.

However, on both of the reports I had derogatory accounts that were all school loans. On transunion and Equifax I have 5 Federal school loans that are deferred but under adverse accounts. There are also 2 other loans, that I guess were directly from the college, one of which is currently reporting from a collections agency, the other is  saying it is going to be placed for collections? 

Although I know I really should be paying on my loans now, however, I am not quite ready yet to especially since I *hopefully* will be also having a car loan payment to be taking care of and insurance and any other new car such and such, so I'd rather wait to start paying them until I know about how much I have left over after these other living expenditures.

Anyways, I had thought that loans that were deferred or inactive yet or whatever, would not be reporting on my credit until I had started paying them. Although I did not have access to experian without paying, I assume it is reporting the same things.

The only positive account I have on my reports is a closed/completed loan I had with my federal credit union last year that I had gotten specifically to improve my credit.

So, besides claiming disputes on the reports, is there anything that can be to fix these from being derogatory or am I screwed until I start paying on them?

Also, I'm really close to being eligible for a loan with my bank. At 622 on my Equifax, the loan counselor there told me I need at least a score of 640 to be approved (probably for the lowest APR :/ ) for a loan at my credit union. Is there anything I can do to raise my score about 20 or more points in the next 2 months?
I had found somewhere on the internet that I could try to get some of my utilities that I have been paying on for over a year or so to report my account, but when I called cox communications, they said they only get involved with my credit if I default on my payments.
So no positive reporting from them I guess...
I also have accounts with Dominion power for over a year as well, and possibly my water company I could try maybe? I also recently have gotten health insurance this year, would it be possible to get any of these accounts to positively report on my credit reports to bring up my score?

I am in a situation where I'm going to desperately need my own transportation to get to work and school (will be moving to a place where buses and taxis are not common) so I really need a car by July.

My last thing, I think I currently only have a few ""hard"" inquires on my account and getting the equifax report counted as another. If at the end of June I thought my credit score had increased enough to qualify for a loan, should I try to get another free credit report from my bank (that will only check the one report) or buy the 3 reports and FICO score from myFICO to check my score before applying for a loan (which would be another hard inquiry I think)? Or should I just not risk adding extra inquiries to my credit report and just apply for the loan?

personalfinance,Which credit card personality are you?,"Which credit card personality are you?

Credit card companies provide credit cards with different features like different interest rate, different 

reward structure, different credit limits etc. If you understand the way you deal with credit it gets easier to choose the best combination for you. Let’s see what kinds of credit personalities exist and what 

card they should opt for.

If you're looking for a new credit card, it's possible that you get overwhelmed with various options available. 0% introductory rates, no annual maintenance fees, cash back, airline miles and low 

interest rates etc., all have their own benefits. As such, you'll want to choose something you can optimize for your particular requirements. For instance, it's not worth to earn airline miles if you don't 

travel.

To choose the best credit card, you should check your credit card personality. Understanding spending habits will help you narrow your choices. Following are few personalities to guide you 

judgement:

The Lady / Big spender

This breed works hard and plays harder. They like the best of everything.

These people are usually not good planners. As such, they'll want to find a card with low interest rates and no annual maintenance fee. That way, they'll be less exposed to get burned by high costs 

over time if they make the occasional bad buying decision.

The Planner

Unlike the first category, this breed is willing to sacrifice short-term pleasure for long-term gain. Cards with rewards that pay dividends over the long time are best suited for these people.

The Newcomer

They're finally out on your own shell. So, what next? They're inexperienced with credit and while they're ready to test the waters, they don't want to get in over their head.

These people need to get a card with low interest rates and low limits which is best suited for such personalities.

These are just a few credit card personalities and its possible that you possess altogether different requirement. Make sure that you brainstorm on your credit card personality before going for one.",finance,1431668155

At that point I shelfed it, as to be honest I didn't feel it was production ready and I have a full time job, so this is just a hobby. Battling against non compiling code I do enough of during the day! By the way, I was not a participant in the crowdsale and have no vested interest other than academic.

Since last weekend and the announcement of Frontier I decided to dust off and try again. I've evaluated on Ubuntu 14.02, Windows 8.1 and OSx with both geth and Alethzero

Alethzero I have found to be very buggy and difficult to compile on platforms other than OSX. Apparently it is the only one that has GPU mining (crashes on windows), so its the only option if you want to compete. Geth also crashed a couple of times and got invalid blocks etc, but at least it compiles and seems to be slightly higher quality.

In my opinion the Team would better to suspend Alethzero and concentrate purely on Geth in OSx and Ubuntu. Forget about pretending to support windows for either product. By having Alethzero around with GPU mining you are locking out people who don't have OSX and users of Geth. I can't get any test Ether to run even trivial contracts. I just wanted to play with it, but now I've given up again on Ethereum. If its still around in 6 months time I might try again.

Rate hike expectations have shifted considerably with relatively dovish commentary from FED policymakers and weaker than expected economic releases from US.

* **As of now market is predicting first rate hike of 25 basis points in January 2016, followed by second rate hike in June 2016. Chart courtesy SoberLook.com.**

As of now, Federal Reserve policymakers have indicated that any move would be data driven and now with market predicting no hike this year it is a challenge for policymakers whether to act ahead of market expectation. Most of the officials so far seems to have agreed on at least one rate hike this year and March's Fed funds rate projection by participants indicate still 50 basis points hike.

**June meeting turns crucial -**

* With data faltering to downside, FED will have to clearly communicate what it might be doing this year, any hawkish indication could result in severe market swings given no hike expectation this year.

* Moreover FED will publish participant's projection for growth, inflation and fed funds rate, which will be closely watched. If projection still maintains upbeat forecast with 50 basis points hike signal would be very hawkish and dollar and short term treasury yield will more likely shoot up. However as of now that doesn't look to be very probable.

Federal Reserve will hold press conference post policy announcement on June 17th after two day meeting.

A quick rundown of what I'm about: I'm halfway through a technical degree, I want to apply to grad school when I finish. I have been living on my own for 5 years, and made ""a lot"" of money serving. I paid for my first two years of university in cash from tips, but once my course work became more demanding I had to apply for a student loan and work less. I'm 4 years into my program, I expect to finish in 6 (which is normal for the program I am in).

In the last year I spent A LOT of money travelling and was being pretty irresponsible. This has lead to both financial, and academic, problems.

I'm ready to stop being an idiot though, and get both my finances and academics under control again. I've moved back home and won't be paying rent, although I will be taking care of the internet bill, my wireless bill, and my commuting. Food is being taken care of as well. I am very fortunate this is an option.

I am not concerned about buying a house/condo/property anytime soon, I am not eager to start a family, and owning a vehicle is not really a big deal to me. Financially, I am only worried about my education. I just want to keep everything manageable so that I can continue with university.

So, today I am here for financial advice.

A basic run-down of my accounts:

Chequing: +150

Visa: ~ -5,200

Mastercard: ~ -4,100

Student loans (prov/fed): ~ -25K (I still need to get the exact numbers for the federal loan)

Monthly expenses (Internet/Wireless/Commute): 205

I think the job that can potentially generate the most income for me is serving, so I have 2 serving jobs this summer, plus 2 casual jobs. I am hoping to bring in at least 2K/month for this summer. In the past, I have made more than this but I'm at new jobs so I am not sure what to expect. When I return to school in Sept. I expect to make at least 600/month. 

I am going to focus on paying down my Visa first, then my Mastercard. I want to work really hard on living cash-only. I have no plans to travel in the next year. 

I also want to try and pay more of my tuition upfront instead of using my loan. It is interest free for 6 months until I finish/stop going to school, but I'd like to try and slow down how much I am borrowing. I may take a lighter course load so that I don't have to pay as much in tuition per term.

This summer, I want to pay off most of my Visa and save 1500$ for tuition, and maybe borrow a little from my student loan. Between Sept and Dec, I should make at least 2400$, and would like to use 1500$ toward tuition for the Winter, and the rest towards the remaining balance on my Visa and Mastercard.

Once I graduate, I may consider taking a year off, working in my field+working part-time serving, and paying off as much of my student loan as possible/saving before applying to grad school. 

I'm going to keep track of all my spending and debts. I made an excel sheet today with all the information. I have never done this before, and seeing it all laid out is already helping me more clearly see my situation. I know this is probably trivial, but I guess I've just had a flippant attitude towards money.

Anyway, if there is any advice, or any insight, it would be very appreciated.",finance,1431683340

We don't make a whole lot of money, but we are comfortable enough to spend up to $200 a month (once we make the last $200 payment on his truck) for a while, and have enough in savings and such on the off chance something happens, so we won't miss a payment.

Our easiest option seems to be [Newegg's credit offer](http://promotions.newegg.com/Newegg/PA110708/index.html) since that's where I will be buying things from , but I'm a bit confused on how they word things. From my understanding, you get 6 months no interest up to $500 and then 12 months no interest over $500. If you are late on a payment, it's a $35 fee? We're planning to get right at $1,000.

How do they determine the monthly payments? Will they just divide $1000 by 12? Or will they set it up some other way? Say I want to plan to pay it in 8 months, can I set it up so that's the payments? My parents have warned me that some credit cards will charge if you make more than the monthly payments, but I don't know how true this is, and couldn't find anything like that in what I read... but legal stuff confuses me.

Our other option would be a loan from [our bank](https://www.fivestarcu.com/), but I'm really not sure how loans work, or what the difference is between it and a credit card? To my knowledge, credit cards can loan you money as you need it, without having to apply over and over, in exchange for higher interest rates. Loans on the other hand, require applying for each time, but have cheaper interest. Correct? Do they effect your credit history differently? Or is a $1,000 loan vs $1,000 credit card charge going to equate to the same amount of credit?

I just want to make sure I make the right decision for this. We want the least amount of hassle for the most amount of credit. If anyone has any advice, please do let me know! :)",finance,1431692719

From my paycheck it says my Gross pay  Year to Date is $7264.26

I have claimed 0 so they take the most out of my paycheck as possible, just in case I end up owing.

Hi PE,

A year ago I have been admitted to a university with a full tuition scholarship. Last semester it's been lowered by 50% since I didn't achieve a 3 GPA and this semester I'm losing the other half.

The university charges $190 per credit and I have 116 to go, leaving me with roughly $22,040. Parents can pay for my housing and other needs.

This university is the only American system uni in Morocco, and it is by far the best compared to pretty much every other college out there. This is the university that forges tomorrow's leaders, sons of ministers, foreign diplomats and a lot of VIPs so to speak receive their education here.

And to be honest, this whole scholarship ordeal only hindered my studies really, always looking for the easy A teacher, dropping courses fearing for my GPA... paying for my own shit should make the process more relaxed, and I feel that if I actually did pay for my tuition (for where I live that's a tremendous amount) I'll pay more attention to my courses.

God damn I'm rambling, anyways, from what I've seen from my bank's website, students loans are paid 15 years later for undergrads, tomorrow I'll set up a meeting with the nearby bank and have a look at the interest rates and what not.

**Personal Loan**

Background: my boyfriend graduated college 7 years ago. His father took out a student loan (not co-signed) at that time and has been presumably making minimum payments on it. The rate is about 7%.


Now: His father would like to ""transfer"" this loan to him now since he would like to take out new loans for other kids now starting college and wouldn't be able to get these new loans without having this current one (~$30,000.00, I believe) paid off. My boyfriend has called the loan company and he can't be added as a cosigner at this point and there's no way to actually transfer it to his name from his dad. 



**Car**

My boyfriend also plans on purchasing a car soon as his current one is on its last leg. I know a lot of car dealerships in our area have a promotion for 0% APR for 60 months, which he'll qualify for.



**Questions**

* Are the rates going to be higher for a personal loan?

* By getting a new loan to pay off the student loan under his dad's name, would he be ""gifting"" him the money?

investing,Euro and Cable rallies face key resistance levels as momentum slows down,"Currency markets continued trading under the same themes as the past few days and the price action was anything else that exciting. The Dollar was again in the backseat as the Euro and the Pound gained against it, however we could see a change in momentum or at least a slowdown as the week ends.

Both the Euro and the Cable have posted significant gains against the US Dollar recently on the back of disappointing reports coming out of the American domestic economy. Traders are looking at a string of weaker than expected performance from the US and have begun to doubt whether the Fed will pull the trigger and raise rates in September, hence the decline of the US currency.

However time might have come for these rallies to slow down a bit, even if it is only temporary, as both European currency pairs are in close proximity of key resistance levels. The Euro traded to 1.1450 yesterday and we know how important the 1.1500 area is as the Single currency slowed down its ascend. With the Euro battling to remain above the 1.1400 level this morning we believe that a retracement lower or at least a consolidation seems more likely during this last trading session of the week.

Similar is our analysis for the Cable that hit 1.5800 during the past 24 hours with the UK currency having run a more than impressive rally against the Dollar. The surprisingly easy win for the Tories in the General Election has allowed the Pound to move higher as investors looked to back the currency ahead of more years under the same government.

However, from a technical standpoint the 1.5800 level is a critical resistance area and we are not surprised to see that the Cable rejected it after its first approach. We think it will be tough for the currency to overcome this barrier at this time, there’s little in terms of expected news, developments or reports to spur further gains. Our analysis points towards a step back from the Cable and it will be interesting to see whether the currency will remain above the 1.5700 area.",finance,1431703755
personalfinance,Taxes for a commission based independent contractor? This is completely new for me.,"I live in Oregon, by the way, if that makes any difference. I don't know how varied state tax laws are.  I've only ever worked in Oregon. I make between $500-$1200/month depending on if I work 2, 3 or 4 days that week. It's roughly $70-$140 per day but it's usually about $100, give or take $10ish.

So I just got a job where I'm paid commission only. I just get written a check with no taxes taken out. I put about $200/month in savings for taxes because I will have to pay them eventually but that's all I know. Can someone please explain this to me? The whole idea is new to me. 

My co-workers have a lady who does their taxes each year but they don't really know what she does. She just tells them to keep receipts for anything that could even almost be related to owning your own business. I can do that but I don't know how any of this works beyond that. I don't like being so in the dark about my money. 

Could I claim space rent on my taxes? I work in a grooming salon for dogs and they pay me 60% of whatever I make while they keep the other 40%. They provide the facility, work space and limited work supplies. I provide my own tools. 

Do they still give me a paper saying how much I made around tax time? Like a W-2? Could I get that more often? How? How does doing taxes quarterly work? Can I learn to do this myself? If so, how? Do I do separate things for state and federal? Can this be done online? I'm rather lost. 

I'm also planning on working in a different department of the company occasionally and that position is paid hourly with taxes taken out like normal. I've done those before without problem but never at the same time as commission work. 

On another, slightly related note, how would I have a proof of income for this job for applying for state healthcare? I have checks but they don't say how long I had to work to get that amount or anything. I don't clock in or out or anything like that. 

Let me know if you have anymore questions. I included what I thought was relevant but, with how little I understand of this, I could have easily missed something.",finance,1431704564
personalfinance,"Considering joining the Peace Corps, is this a financially sound idea?","I am 22 years old and currently taking my final junior level courses, and beginning my senior year at a very small public state school in my hometown. 

I'm majoring in Accountancy and have been interning at a small, local CPA firm since the beginning of 2015. I currently have a 3.34 overall GPA, and have maintained a part (sometimes full-time) job since starting college in 2011. My job prior to the internship was at a local animal shelter for three and a half years.

Most of my college has been paid for by taking out student loans, the rest has been out of my personal pocket and scholarships. I currently have ~16k in student loan debt, and will finish college ~22k in debt. 

I also have a small unsecured loan that my uncle cosigned with me. My interest rate is 8.95%, and I have paid the balance down from $4k to just under $3k over the past year while making timely payments, well over the monthly minimum.

I have been doing a lot of soul searching lately, and I have found myself at a crossroads with my future career in the accounting field. 

I love accounting. I love the mental challenge it brings, along with the satisfaction of a job well done. However, I realize this is a money hungry field, and many people that become deeply involved in it can potentially go down the path of greed and self-satisfaction. I personally cannot allow myself to do this. I have seen first hand what the love of money does to a person, and it is not something I find appealing.

Without trying to sound conceited, I know I won't have any trouble finding a job upon graduating. I've got the social skills required for business down pact, and the experience I am gaining from working at the CPA firm has immensely bolstered my resume. I will continue to work at the firm from now until I graduate college in May of 2016. 

Having said all of that, it has been weighing heavily on me lately that I need to give back. I have a gift for communication and uplifting those around me, I feel it would be selfish not to utilize these talents. 

The advice I'm seeking from r/personalfinance is:
* Should someone in my shoes venture down the path of the Peace Corps? 

* If this does work out, what are some things I could do to take care of my debts while away from home? 

* I will earn roughly $15k this year, is there a method of saving that could help me pay down my car in almost full?

Any and all advice is appreciated, and if there are any RPCVs on here, I'd really enjoy your feedback as well.

I will be checking in through the day periodically, so if any more information could be contributed on my end, please feel free to let me know.",finance,1431704714
personalfinance,"401k to IRA, Roth IRA or new company SRA","I recently started a new job and have $25k in a 401k with my old company. I'm 26 y/o in the 25% bracket, claiming 2. I claimed 1 in Jan, Feb, March with lower salary.

Option 1: Rollover to SRA
My new company (a college) accepts rollovers to the TIAA-CREF SRA (supplemental retirement annuity) which guarantees my principal and minimum interest. I am not yet eligible for the 5% match TIAA-CREF RA (retirement annuity) which also guarantees principal and a minimal interest rate.  The RA and SRA are treated as different ""buckets"". I am definitely going to do the 5% match when i am eligible (1 year from April). But i can rollover the 25k to the SRA and contribute with pretax dollars until i get the match for the other bucket.

Option 2: Traditional IRA
Traditional IRA would allow me to invest as I would like. I would like to use Motif to buy and sell, and Falcon Stocks on the side for research and opportunistic purchases. Going down this route would give me the option to contribute after tax dollars if I want, but also allow me to invest freely while building up another 401k from scratch.

Option 3: Roth IRA
The only con here is the 6k tax.. which I am not sure I can afford outside of the money in that bucket. I just bought a house this past november and am now buying a roof and pool. The other issue is that this will push me to the 28% bracket but probably not by much. Depends on deductions for my house, if i do any pretax deductions for retirement here at my new job, if i have deductible contributions to an ira or the SRA since i'm not eligible for the 401k yet. But tax free growth is enticing.. 

Option 4: Leave it! It's all index funds right now.

personalfinance,I'm paying off a Parent Loan that my Dad took out to help me pay for college. I need a strategy to lower the interest rate and get it paid off quicker?,"My Dad took out a parent loan to help me pay for school. Once I graduated, he informed me that he had been deferring payment the entire time I was in school and that he expected me to pay the loan back now that I had graduated. In the interest of keeping the peace with my Dad, I agreed to pay back the loan (since it was for my own education) even though he had let 4 years of interest accrue without making a payment while I was in school. The interest rate for the loan is 8%, and the payments are currently approximately $275 per month. The current balance is about $32,000 (which means at this rate the loan repayment duration will be 20 years, and I'll end up paying more interest than the principle amount of the loan). My question is this: is there a way I can get this loan in my name and lower the interest rate somehow? I am thinking about taking out a home equity loan to pay off my Dad's parent loan, but I'm not exactly sure how that works. I have an estimate $35,000 of equity in my home currently.

personalfinance,"I am not vested and leaving my job. If I rollover my basic retirement fund from my employer into an IRA, then convert it into a Roth IRA, could I then withdraw this contribution as principal from my Roth IRA penalty/tax free?","Hello! I am leaving a job and would prefer to take the money from my retirement fund because I am trying to obtain a visa and only money in a checking/savings account, and not money in investments, counts for a visa requirement.

Regardless, my retirement fund gives me two options upon leaving since I am not yet vested: take the refund and pay plus 4% interest, 20% federal tax, and 10% tax penalty OR roll it over to an 'IRA or a qualified retirement plan.' (There is no option of keeping it where it is by the way)

Since you can withdraw principal from a Roth IRA penalty free at any time, if I roll over my employer retirement fund into a Roth IRA could I then withdraw all of it as in would it all be considered a contribution, none of it because of some rule about initial contributions, or just whatever my contributions and not gains were initially in the employer retirement fund? Would this be penalty free and tax free, or what would the taxes be on withdrawing?

If a Roth IRA does not count as a 'qualified retirement plan', could I roll over my employer retirement fund into a Traditional IRA, convert it into a Roth IRA since anyone can convert a Traditional IRA into a Roth, and then try and withdraw the principal as above?

And finally, is all of this shady or is it a totally legitimate thing to try and do?

news,"Laughingstock of MENA? Oligarchs Hijack the Anger of Arab Youth, LOL…….","A lot of conferences and symposiums and fora are held in the Gulf region. All allegedly representing the whole Arab world, from the Gulf to the Atlas Mountains. Another one was held recently in Dubai which seemed to trend toward pinning the blame for Arab problems on anybody but those responsible: the Arab establishment.

Just why are the Arabs angry? And how angry are the “young Arabs” at being “a laughingstock” according to Roger Cohen and Amr Moussa? And do the masses of Arab youths from Iraq to Morocco really give a hoot about the preferences and prejudices of unelected Gulf oligarchs? 

And who best expresses the anger of Arab “youth” according to most Western media types and pundits?
Why, it is first of all Amr Moussa, former Egyptian foreign minister then secretary general of the Arab League under Hosni Mubarak. Who else can express revolutionary anger but an octogenarian man of the establishment? Then after that who else but the absolute Saudi princes, then the absolute oligarchs of the UAE and Bahrain and Qatar.

And why are the Arab youth allegedly supposedly perhaps so angry that Persian Iran has influence in the Persian Gulf, but they are not angry that Britain, France, Monaco, and Colombian mercenaries are building bases in the same Persian Gulf faster than pero-money can finance them? And why are these “youths of the whole Arab world” allegedly represented by a handful of foreign absolute kings, princes, potentates, and their paid media minions?

And why are Arab youths, according to Amr Moussa and others, not angry at their rulers instead of being angry at foreigners who take advantage of meddling opportunities created by the rulers? Shouldn’t they be angry, as they used to be in past decades, at their rulers for enabling foreigners (Iranians, Turks, Israelis, Westerners) to wield influence?

All this puzzling “stuff” I gleaned from the recent article by Roger Cohen in the New York Times.  Written in the warm afterglow of a well-fed six-star conference in the United Arab Emirates. While the Yemenis next door got bombed and starved by the same brotherly and sisterly Arab oligarchs.

As the title says....$25,000!! That is after I go in for confirmation. Well, firstly I would like to double check to make sure that my math is right for the taxes. Federal tax for sweepstakes winnings is 25% ($25,000 x 0.25=$6,250) and the state income is 5% ($25,000 x 0.05=$1,250). So, total that is taken for taxes is $7,500. Which would bring my take home total to $17,500. 

Provided this is legit and my math is correct, here is my game plan:

* Pay off debt (Credit card = ~$1,500, Car note = ~$1,800, student loan = $1,900)
* $10K into my betterment account (half for emergency fund and half for my 'new car fund')
* The remaining $2,546 for my spending account?? Not too sure on this, may add it to the investing account or shrink it down and add less to the spending account.

I maintain a $5000+ emergency fund, and if anything drastic were to happen, my dad would be able to help me out.

As it stands, I'll have approximately 200K in loans at graduation, mostly federal, but some from my school. As an intern/resident I'll make 45-60K for 3-4 years and then 200-250K from there on out. Job security is extremely good in the field I'm planning on going into. How I'll pay off my debt depends on where I do my residency, but basically the plan is to minimize lifestyle inflation so I can pay it off as quickly as possible before I have kids or a mortgage. My current expenses are pretty low relative to other med students because I don't have a car payment or dependents and I have a roommate. Because of this, the financial aid office would happily give me a few thousand dollars extra in federal loans each year if I asked for it.

I have some time off each year, and I've been considering the possibility of traveling abroad as cheaply as possible. For example, I could go to Iceland for a week for ~$1000. Alternately, I could visit my brother and friends on the opposite coast once or twice a year for  ~$500 each time. 

Part of me feels like I shouldn't spend money I haven't earned on something I don't need, especially when I'll be paying for it two or three times over by the time my loans are paid off. But another part of me feels like a couple thousand dollars is a drop in the bucket compared to the the sum I'll owe, so I might as well do something awesome and memorable instead of just blowing money on takeout and Netflix. I've also heard the argument that by the time I have a real salary I won't have the time or flexibility to travel that I have now, and my standard of living will have increased to the point that I'm no longer willing to fly at 6am and stay in hostels, so the cost of a similar trip would be much greater. Honestly I don't know which argument I find more persuasive.

After school I went to grad school (3 years) and started working as a scientist ($65,000/year).

At this time, my student loans have now ballooned into $265,000 of debt, just based on interest accrued over the last 10 years. I owe about 10 different lenders, mostly SallieMae (now Navient), AES, and Chase. My monthly loan payments are around $2,500, and my monthly take-home is about $3,300. I've used all of my deferment and grace period extensions on all of my loans.

I've been living paycheck to paycheck since my first job in high school and have no savings. I rent, and don't yet own my car. If given the chance, I'd certainly do things differently and attend an in-state school, and approach things in a much wiser manner. My parents didn't know any better, and neither did I.

So, I am almost to the breaking point. I've been the CheckIntoCash and pawn shops way too often just to try not to default (obviously these are extremely poor stop-gaps). I shopped around for my current job and had to move thousands of miles to get this salary, and unfortunately the cost of living here is very high, making $800/month unfeasible for where I have to work when considering rent, utilities, car payment, etc. Within a month of two, I'll stop being able to make on-time payments, and my parent's equally bad finances mean the repayment burden will fall on them, which will mean they will lose their house.

I'm not a bad kid, and have been continuously employed since 14, never got into any trouble, and just didn't know a thing about finances when starting out in the world. Is there anything I can do now to fix my situation? I don't want my parents to suffer horribly because of my own ineptitude, and wish there was something I could do. I called each loan company and spoke at length (many hours) about alternate repayment plans, hardships, etc., but the best they can do are graduated repayment structures, etc., but nothing brings the monthly payments into payable territory for me. I really need the advice of somebody who knows how to help.

Thanks for any insights.


EDIT -- Thanks for all the helpful suggestions. Oh, and fuck all the idiots saying I shouldn't have kids and stuff... I'm a goddam human being working hard, and picking the wrong school at 18 doesn't equate for mandatory sterilization you retarded pricks. On a happier note, I got a lot of good advice here and will contact a lawyer with my parents, and will work on a plan. I'll attempt IBR for my smaller federal loans and graduated payment structures for the private loans. I'll also consider consolidation, release of parental co-signers, and just generally pick up odd jobs and keep hunting for a better job. Thanks everyone (except the assholes)!",finance,1431749236

8 months ago when I was 18, I applied for and received a Capital One card with a $300 limit and a 24.90% interest rate. I was stupid and maxed out the card within a few days. I did not pay the bill for 8 months, and accumulated a balance of $438.07.

According to Credit Karma, both my TransUnion and Equifax scores are 378, my utilization percentage is 150%, and my payment history percentage is 57.1% Capital One's credit tracking service says that my Transunion score is 526.

Last week I payed off my balance in full. I do not owe Capital One any more money. My question is what should I do to raise my credit score to an acceptable number, and how long will it take? Also, why is the credit score that Capital One is reporting so different than the one Credit Karma is reporting?

personalfinance,Success v. debt collector! Some Saturday morning inspiration,"Hey fellow PFers,

I [posted a while back](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/30cms6/debt_validation_outside_the_30day_window/) about a debt collector who was basically refusing to validate.  Here's a happy update.

I asked a lawyer to draft a notice to the effect that the debt collector's refusal to validate was a violation of federal law and that we were within our rights to sue.  Lo and behold, not a week later they have sent me a copy of the original bill.  Oddly enough it references the original validiation request which they claimed they never got :)

The bill was from a medical clinic.  Apparently, during an urgent care visit many years ago, one of my doctors was actually from this 3rd party clinic, not the hospital.  However, it was the hospital's job to give the clinic my insurance and billing info, which they apparently never did.  So, I found my EOB and receipt for payment to the hospital and had a phone conversation with the clinic's business manager.  I made sure to keep a respectful tone and stuck to trying to ascertain the facts rather than placing blame.

She was actually very sympathetic and said ""Obviously you shouldn't get you credit damaged for something that was not your fault.  I'm going to call the collection agency and get this taken care of.""  So now I have in writing that the clinic admits it was a billing error and has requested that the debt collector cease attempting to collect.

So, hopefully, this is ironclad defense against the debt collector and any future shenanigans.  All it took was some patience and a respectful conversation with the right person.  It helped that I was able to prove I had provided my information to the hospital and paid them on time.  Save everything!",finance,1431786004

personalfinance,"18 F, currently in college, in debt, and need advice before I screw myself over.","Hi, I am a female freshman enrolled in a community college.  I have been in school since summer of 2015, but was only going part-time + working, so I technically only have a freshman amount of credits.  I will be taking summer courses starting Monday, about ~11 credit hours, which is the largest amount of hours so far I've taken in college.
I currently have a workstudy job at my school and make 8.25$/hour, ~15/hours a week.  
For Spring semester and Summer semester I have taken out a Direct Federal Unsubsidized loan for $5500, and am currently thinking about taking out another loan for the fall semester.  My parents make too much money on paper for me to get a grant, but they cannot afford to help me with college.  They already pay my car insurance, utilities, among a few other things. 
I also have a Wells Fargo college credit card that I owe $491.28 on.
I pay 325$ in rent a month, 49$/mo for cell phone.  Those are the bills that are constant.

I plan on getting an associates degree and transferring to a State university to do a B.S. in Computer Science.

Anyways, lately I feel myself spiraling deeper and deeper into bad spending habits.  I live with my boyfriend, who I drive to work because we only have one car.  He works kind of far away so it is quite a bit of gas.  He is also a college student.  He makes 9.50/hr with about 30/hrs a week and is taking the summer semester off to work.  He just recently got this job and was unemployed before this.  He will owe $650 to my mother this month because he was unable to pay rent last month. He hasn’t been paid yet so I’m hoping his job can help some…

I applied to the Wells Fargo credit card because I thought I would use it to build up my credit, but that quickly went bad...I started using it to buy food, gas, pay college bills, etc.  I now owe almost 500$ on it.  I just simply don't make enough at my work-study job and I really need extra money security.  I don't live frugally enough either.  

I have really bad anxiety issues and depression, sometimes so bad I cannot leave my bed for a few days and I do not shower, eat, etc.  That is the main reason why I took part-time college classes, and mostly at night, because I could not handle a full load.  Also, for this reason, I tend to miss a lot of work because it is such a flexible job that they don’t care if I miss.  However, I end up suffering financially when paycheck times come, because of this. 

I pay rent to my mom, who is the one on the lease.  Last month I was short 100$ for rent.  This month I don’t know if I’ll even make enough because last week was really hard for me and I had to miss work.  I feel lost, and useless.  I am scared about this summer semester because of how many hours I’ll be taking plus work, I might have a meltdown.  I have had to stop seeing my psychiatrist and therapist because my parents say they can no longer afford to pay for it.  I have a few refills on my prescriptions but I don’t know how I’ll afford them, except for using the credit card and getting into more debt.

I am really going to try and push myself as hard as I can this summer, and get used to working and going to school.  I applied at an out-of-state University that I am in love with, but I realize that is going to just put me into too much debt, so I’ll have to just stay in-state.  

I receive the portion of my loan that gets taken out of my tuition in June, which will be about ~$1,393.  I will use that to get food, rent, etc.  My parents already have paid for my textbooks.

Does anyone have any advice for me?  How to be more frugal, student grants or something.  Should I cut up this credit card? I know I should, but I feel like it gives me a safety net in case of emergency.

Any advice would be helpful!!! Thank you, and sorry if this is disorganized and hard to read, I’m kind of sleep deprived.",finance,1431790932
personalfinance,High-yield checking accounts still exist. Not using one is tantamount to leaving money on the table.,"[The trick is, most - but not all - of the banks offering high-yield checking are local.](http://www.debt.com/news/best-high-yield-checking-accounts)

In contrast, the smaller banks listed offer up to 3.25% interest with no fees or minimum balance requirements.

On a $10,000 account, that's the difference between $3 and $325 of interest annually.

politics,"The Political Truth About Trade Agreements, and the Facts Behind the TPP","Democrats do not support trade agreements, while Republicans do.

That is the main idea of the first half of what I'm posting about.  To support that claim, we can look no further than the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the FTA between the US, Canada, and Mexico.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce credits NAFTA with increasing US trade in goods and services with Canada and Mexico from $337 billion in 1993 to $1.2 trillion in 2011.  

So what was the vote when it reached congress?

**House:**

 | Total | Democrats | Republicans | Independent
:---|:---:|:----:|:----:|:----:
Aye | 234 | 102 | 132 | 0
Nay | 200 | 156 | 43 | 1

**Senate:**

 | Total | Democrats | Republicans 
:---|:---:|:----:|:----:
Aye | 61 | 27 | 34
Nay | 38 | 26 | 12

NAFTA was also [credited with creating wage](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/11/12/study-nafta-raised-pay-here-and-abroad/) increases in Canada, Mexico and the US (.96%, 1.3%, and .17%, respectively).  In the 90s, wages were either staying the same or falling, not rising.  The NAFTA changed that for the better.

My point in this is that most Democrats would be against the TPP even if it were public.  The fact that Obama is keeping it private gives Democrats something else to complain about that will only help them in the next elections.  What is going on is a political move.  It bars Republicans in Congress from sending threatening letters, and it allows for the Democrats to speak out against the TPP without actually having to speak out on a controversial issue that might affect them in the polls.  It's pure political genius.

So, why would the US be interested in the Trans-Pacific Partnership?  Well, for starters, **Brunei**.  In 2013, over 95% of Brunei's exports were oil, gas, and other related products.  Currently Brunei extracts about 372,000 barrels of oil everyday.  By 2035, they are expected to be extracting 650,000 barrels per day.

Another party involved in the TPP is **Chile**.  The US has been expanding its presence in South America, with a FTA put in place with Peru back in 2006 (put into effect 2009).  US goods exports to Peru totaled $10.1 billion in 2013, up 7.6% from 2012, and up 63% from 2008 (pre-FTA).

Now, we already have a FTA in place with Chile, with this year marking the 12th straight year of tariff reductions, meaning all US products will now enter Chile duty free.  So why is Chile so important to the US?  In 2013, the US goods exports to Chile totaled $17.6 billion, down 6.3% from 2012, and up 548% from 2003 (pre-FTA).

Right now, the US has a small advantage over China in Chilean imports.  The TPP will bring the US and Chilean economies closer, helping to expand that gap.  So yes, I am saying that the US has a positive benefit for the signing the TPP just because of Chile, due to economic competition with China.

Another country involved, **Vietnam**, is one where we have lots of money tied into investments already.  The US and Vietnam do not have a FTA in place, though they have what is called a TIFA in place.  TIFA stands for ""Trade and Investment Framework Agreement.""  What that means is that the US dumps money into Vietnam's economy in exchange for reduced tariffs and increased communications between the two countries (we also have a TIFA in place with Brunei).  

Another country we have a TIFA with, who is involved in the TPP talks, is **Malaysia**.  Our exports in 2012 to Malaysia were worth $15 billion, while our imports totaled $27 billion.  As of right now, Malaysia has FTAs in place with Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Chile, China, and Pakistan.  Once again, the US would benefit from a FTA just because of the economic competition with China.

A TIFA does not compete well with a FTA.  By that I mean, a country will favor those with whom a FTA is in place with over those with a TIFA.  The US wants in on the talks because they have TIFAs in place with Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam, while other countries would be getting FTAs.  That puts the US further down on the pecking order when it comes to imports/exports.

The US already has FTAs with **Australia**, **Korea**, **Singapore**, **Canada**, **Mexico**, and **Chile**.  That leaves us getting FTAs with Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan.

So what are the intentions of the US in this deal?  I think this will lead us to a FTA with China.  Right now, China has very large tariffs on US products.  The last time we had a major economic deal with China, China entered the WTO.  Their entrance was subject to them reducing large tariffs.  One example of this is the tariffs China had on our auto manufacturers.  In the year 2000, China had tariffs upwards to 100% on our auto manufacturers, and they were required to reduce that to 25% by the year 2007.  In March of this year, car sales between Ford and GM in China totaled 443,192 cars, compared to 485,804 sales from Ford and GM in the US in March.

A new FTA with China would be amazing, and could be the best thing for our economy.  In a new FTA, we could negotiate for reduced tariffs, or even product/design protections for US corporations, though that probably won't happen for a while.

So what are the cons of the TPP?

Well, we don't know what is in it.  I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing.  Look at what happened when the terms on the deal with Iran became public.  Our stupid ass Congress sent them a letter saying they would be willing to violate international law by revoking the deal if Republicans get the Presidential office next election.

I am not one to trust authority, as virtually everyone who knows me would be able to tell you, but I can trust authorities who have safeguards in place to protect us.  For example, I trust the police because I know that there are processes in place to hold them accountable if they do something illegal (although, not so much right now).

As I see it, there are nine safeguards on the TPP: South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.  If our economy were to be ruined by a trade agreement like this, none of those countries would support it, let alone all of them.  When our economy falls, so does the global economy.  Our failures in 2007/2008 led to one of the worst global recessions in a long time (sorry, Greece).  Every single country in the global economy suffered because us Americans fucked up big time.  Those nine countries were all hit hard by our fuckups, and so none of them would support something that we fuck us over.

I would love to be able to read the TPP before it gets passed, but I understand why our government wouldn't want it public.  Us, as Americans, usually do not handle foreign affairs properly, and tend to only do harm in negotiations.  The TPP will be the largest FTA the US has ever signed, with this FTA controlling 40% of our imports and exports around the world. 

_____

What will this mean for the next federal election cycle?

If the TPP is fast tracked by Republicans and the deal turns out to be a good one, Republicans will get a lot of support next cycle.  If the TPP is fast tracked by Republicans and the deal is awful, Obama's head will be on the chopping block, but Democrats will see lots of support.  If the TPP is fast tracked by a bipartisan force and it turns out well, Democrats can take the trophy home.  If the TPP is fast tracked by a bipartisan force and it sucks, Democrats as a whole will take the hit.

Democrats in Congress should support the TPP because they actually have a large amount to lose.  If the TPP turns out to be a success, it will be another victory claimed by the Republicans.  If it fails, it will fall on the Democrats.  To limit the political attacks on the Democrats, they should follow the bulk of the Republicans so they can say that they were all wrong.  It would be way too risky, politically speaking, to separate from Obama and the Republicans.

**TL;DR** I think that this FTA will be successful because there are so many allies involved in this deal, and the other countries are all countries we currently invest in.  This deal has high upside, with very, very low risk.  To me, the reward outweighs the risks heavily, and congressional Dems need to either publicly make a stand against the fast track or support the TPP.",energy,1431792783

I honestly don't know who to turn to, and would definitely appreciate any advice. My parents have been helping me out with paying them up to this point, but they are no longer able to help financially, and I desperately need to find a solution.     
    
My background:    
Graduated with a degree in Film in 2011. Currently living in my parents house, saving as much money as possible, and have a wedding later this year (which is paid off already). My fiancee and I are hoping to be able to save for a down payment on a house, though I'm not sure we are financially stable enough to afford even a basic home at this time. My credit score is surprisingly decent at 770.    
    
My salary (after taxes): $26,000    
Her salary (after taxes): $17,000    
    
Student Loans:    
Discover Private Loan: $47,000 @ 3.25% / $400 monthly payment    
Discover Private Loan: $28,000 @ 11% / $350 monthly payment    
Federal Stafford Loan: $25,000 @ ~6% / $350 monthly payment    
    
My fiancee and I live pretty frugally, though we do have a car payment to contend with, as well as normal living expenses. To be honest a $1100 monthly payment is just too much for us to afford, especially if we start paying rent/mortgage, but every time I try to work out a different payment plan no one is willing to budge on the payment amount (since the bulk of my debt is private loans). I don't want to keep using forbearance as it will just make things worse in the long term, and my forbearance is nearly maxed out on the Discover loans. Based on our budget we can afford about $600 a month, which doesn't go very far when the loans are so piled on. And that's with putting no money into savings or retirement planning.    
    
I have been considering loan consolidation for the private loans, especially to get rid of that 11% one, but I'm not sure who to turn to. I know Wells Fargo, SoFi, and CharterOne offer student loan consolidation, but I'm not sure who would be best or if this is even a good decision. Any advice from someone who has consolidated student loans?    
    
Many of those places also offer rolling your federal and private loans into one, but since federal loans are much easier to handle I'm concerned about doing this, in case of future financial hardship.    
    
I'm trying to come up with a plan of action to take charge, get these loans paid off, and get on with my life. I just don't know where to go yet. I'm hoping someone out there has some advice; I would be very thankful for anything.

Right now, I have about $4k in ""extra"" relocation bonus from my employer that I want to use as the start of an emergency/short term savings fund. I will be able to kick an additional $4k/yr into this fund from here on out. I also plan to pay for vacations, of which I might take one a year (~1k), and a new used car (~$5k) whenever my current car becomes uneconomical to keep repairing (I'm guessing it has two more years). Here is my specific question:

Note: I am not separating my emergency fund from my other short-term savings *yet* because it would difficult to invest an amount smaller than $3 or $4k. 

**Is it worth it to invest these funds in a low-risk, low-expense mutual fund (for example, Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index)? It seems like this would give significantly better returns than any savings account I can find and it would not be difficult to get my money out in case of an emergency.**

Follow up questions: 
What would happen to this investment when interest rates in inevitably rise? 
Do funds like this buy/sell bonds as well as collect interest from them (in which case their value would be hurt by rising interest)?
Would a high-yield savings account reflect higher interest rates sooner? It seems like there would be some lag with even a short-term fund as the average maturity is ~2.5 years.

And before anyone asks about retirement savings: My employer is contributing 9% of my salary, or $6,120/yr, into a pre-tax 401k and I am currently kicking another $17k/yr into my after tax 401k, which I plan to roll over into a roth IRA as soon as there is enough in the account (I would probably roll any interest back into my pre-tax 401k to avoid the penalty).",finance,1431794454

Details inside","So, after 6 months of careful budgeting (thanks to r/personalfinance and YNAB) I am now free of credit card debt. Which is an awesome feeling, but I am not sura what my next step should be.

I live in Europe, so the following numbers were converted to USD:

I make approximately 1300 USD a month. With a semi-frugal lifestyle I can save about 350 USD every month on average

I have a student loan of approximately 10.000 USD, with a 5.75% interest rate. Minimum playment is 100 USD/month

Normally the advice in my situation would be to build an emergency fund first, but:

- the company I work for is a Fortune 100 company, and they appreciate young talent - I make almost twice as much as I did 3 years ago when I started. I am performing well, and my responsibilities are continously increasing

- even if there would be a lay-off, the goodbye package will cover at least 3months' salary

- my parents can still help me out if there is an emergency (which I would like to avoid, but there is a safety net)

Now I have calculated a lot, and I think I have 2 options:

A: build an emergency fund and save money while keeping the minimum student loan payments. At this rate it would take like 20 more years to pay it back, but the payments don't hurt a lot, and the interest is relatively low

B: put my monthly savings into my student loans, and pay it back in 3 years. I would be debt free in a few years, but no savings until then.

Amy advice?

personalfinance,"New job starting in August, $250k in student loans. Help me plan to tackle my debt.","30F, married

Short term goals: All unsecured debt paid off ASAP

Long term goals: Financial Independence 

Student Loan debt: 250k as of August 2015
The bulk of the loans (185k) are in a 7.375% federal consolidated loan. I have three private loans for 20k at 7%, 12k at 6.75%, 7.5k at 11%. All other loans are federal at 3.86%.

Credit card debt: 16k at 7%-15%.

Car loans: Car in my husband's name for 15k. I don't know the interest, kind of a complicated situation with that so it may not end up being our responsibility.

Mortgage: 220k at 4.1%, house is rented out with the rent covering all expenses plus the manager's fee. I'll make about $200 a month on it once the PMI is paid off next year. I plan on just rolling it back into the mortgage.



Pending test results I'll be starting a new job as early as mid July. It's contract work, but pays a minimum of 170k a year, though with overtime and some luck could be as high as 260k. I'll have to move to a new city with a high cost of living, like NYC, DC, or San Francisco in order to take this job. It's not a market where I will go more than a few weeks between contracts and most contracts last a year, sometimes several years.

My initial plan is to live on 50k a year plus whatever my husband makes (estimate at 10-25k a year once he finds something), and throw everything else after taxes at my loans highest interest rate first. I'm not worried about managing that at first - I lived in Tokyo on 40k a year, but I know it's going to be hard to stay disciplined, especially after a year or two. That means at the most conservative estimate of my income I'll have the credit cards and the 20k private loan paid off by the end of 2015, but it will take until 2020 to be debt free (not counting the mortgage). Give or take a couple of months to build up a small emergency fund (5k-10k).

Other than shoveling everything I can into the loans and picking up all the overtime I'm allowed, as well as keeping my living expenses down in these expensive cities, I figure my best shot at helping myself along is trying to refinance my big federal loan with a private company like SoFi. I have a decent credit score 700-750 and would meet their requirements once I get a job, but I'm not sure how they are going to see the contract income. It's possible I would not be able to get a better rate. I'm definitely going to apply, but it's possible I won't be able to refinance.

The car situation is this: my husband is broke with no tertiary education and terrible credit. I'm living abroad right now in order to study for the test that's going to qualify me for this work. His mother cosigned a car loan for him so he could get an affordable loan at all. It's complicated because she picked the car and insisted on a new car instead of something used like we wanted. She...doesn't approve of his relationship with me and the decision about the car may have been an attempt to bribe and or control him into staying in his hometown with her when I come back. I take her (32 year old) baby away from her, and have been doing so for the past 7 years. 

Both the loan and the title have her name on it, and she may take the car back from him when we move in July or August. If she does that I don't expect that we will end up having to pay the note since she won't want to bomb her credit as well as his (which can't get much worse anyhow). I believe she'll sell it. I don't even know the interest rate. My husband is not a money person and apparently she has all the documents. I can't find any of this information out until I get back to the US in early July and it's going to be a battle. Worst case scenario is we have a 15k car loan with an overly high interest rate. 

Now let's talk about MY car issues. I have a horse. Riding is my main hobby and keeps me fit. I compete, and it's a big part of my lifestyle. I know a big part of PF is keeping your expenses down and lots of people are going to see the horse as a big expense, but I usually pay around $300 a month for him and I would pay three times that and consider it money well spent. I would be pretty fat without him, and don't even ask about my mental state. I have always worked the barn on the weekends in exchange for a cut in the costs of keeping him, and expect to continue doing so because I have a couple of rare (if not highly paid) skills when it comes to this hobby. 

EDIT: I found out you can rent trucks for this purpose, so I'll just buy a cheap trailer and rent a truck, then go without a car until by debt is paid off.

I only have a tiny (5k, maybe) Roth IRA for retirement so I'm going to need to start worrying about that in the next couple of years. My husband has no retirement savings. Emotionally I'd like to avalanche the whole thing - pay off all the debt then put what I was paying towards that straight into retirement, but I know with compounding interest that's not ideal. I don't really know what I'm doing with this yet.

I plan on hiring an accountant my first year working these contracts to learn how to minimize my tax burden as an independent contractor. I have never had to itemize before, but it's going to be pretty beneficial to learn how to do it.

I know nothing about insurance. We have no children and I am sterilized so that won't become an issue, but my husband has an injury that will probably land him in a wheelchair eventually, though not for quite some time. Perhaps the insurance issue is a good one to table for the moment since I've already thrown a ton of information at you guys.

I'm not even going to consider another mortgage until I'm done with the student loans, and possibly not at all given the cost of real estate in some of the cities I might be working in.

So, TLDR people: I have huge student loans with usurious interest rates. How much and at what point should I start saving for retirement? And at what point should the small emergency fund get turned into the big 6 months to a year's worth of living expenses emergency fund? Is there anything I haven't thought of?",finance,1431800186

- we have a mortgage of $4000/month and no other debt. Our take-home is about $22k a month. Our expenses, including enough savings to maximize retirement, and our nanny, is about $14k/month
- we have $400k in a corporate investment account (I used to run a business and this retained earnings just earning passive income now)
- We have $700k in retirement savings. This is tax deferred, called an RRSP because we are in Canada.
- We have another $350k in stock awards from my company. About half of this is deferred, i.e. can't access it until it vests over three more years. We also have another $400k in equities, non-registered. I guess this our rainy day account.

personalfinance,Personal Finance: Opinions on Student Loan Re-Financing?,"Hello All:

This has been a great sub to read through, learn a lot, and I'm hoping to get some advice on something I'm considering.

First, a little about me, Mr. Dip-Shit-Who-Thinks-Student-Loans-Can't-Hurt-Me:
First off, I'm 29 years old, no spouse, no children (thank god).
2 years ago I graduated law school owing over $100,000+ across 4 federal loans and was paying over $600.00 per month in interest alone. It was painful to look at so I ignored it for about a year. I was raised the son of a frugal janitor and to see that much of my money just evaporating into interest-vapor every month was a kick in the gut.

Then I finally read too many posts about debt management on this forum and got serious. Over the past year I've paid $1,500.00 per month automatically withdrawn. On top of that I usually kick in another $1,200.00-1,800.00 per month to beat down that principal. Doing that things are finally starting to look better. A month ago I paid off the loan with the worst interest rate. It is difficult to express how good that feels. I can stare at that sweet ""paid in full"" notice for HOURS. (I know that's weird, but every dollar I give those a-holes is one less I get to invest for retirement.)

With three loans to go, I am attacking the next beast. My student loans currently sit at about $88,000.00 with an average interest of around 7% averaged across them. Even with the extra money I have each month from paying off one of the loans it'll be at least a year before the next one is repaid. (It comprises about 35% of the remaining debt). And the interest is still in the hundreds each month.

Now here's the question: What do you guys think of Student Loan Re-Financing?

Specifically, I'm looking at SoFi and Ernest. Here's what they're offering:
-FIXED rate of between 5.00-5.4% for a 5 year repayment loan (about $1,600.00 per month)

-NO prepayment penalties, origination fees, starting or application fees

-A late payment charge of only $5.00. (Not a huge issue. I use auto-pay.)

-Reasonable forbearance in case of unemployment (Also not a huge issue for me. I'm lucky enough to be fairly certain of my ability to stay employed or regain employment should my company ever down-size.)

With all that in mind, they'd earn between $10,000-15,000 from me in interest over the next 5 years. But I'd save $15,000+. And if I continued my current rate of repayment I could be paid off in less than 3 years! This seems too good to be true. Do any of you have horror stories or experience with these guys?


TL;DR: I'm considering using a student loan refinancing service for a lower interest rate. The interest rate is fixed, no prepayment or origination fees... so what's the catch? Anyone have experience with SoFi or Ernest?",finance,1431813410

We currently rent a town house for $1270/month, and with interest rates at rock bottom, we're looking to buy a place with a monthly mortgage at or less than we're paying now in rent. However, affordable housing is almost non-existent. We've begun looking at Hamilton due to the lower prices, but even prices there have gone ballistic. We put an offer in on a house listed at $235,000. We went in with a firm offer of $245,000 and still got beat out by $25,000!!

investing,Investing in Human Capital?,"Hello /r/investing!

I have read about things such as [human capital contracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Capital_Contract). I wanted to get the thoughts of people who actually actively invest on something similar though.

I am not sure what return on investment the average person looks for when considering to invest. I was wondering what sort of annual interest rate you would all want out of something closer to a bond.  The idea is to treat these funds as student loans but to buy back bonds regularly upon graduation.

Specifics:

- Bonds would be worth 1000 dollars each.

- Originally looked at 5% interest, compounding annually.

- Bonds begin getting purchased back upon graduation with people being able to opt for ""fast repayment"" or ""higher repayment"" to put themselves in order.

The purpose of this is to eliminate the financial stress of if you can afford routine expenses, tuition in some cases, and other things that can come up (such as car repairs). 

I wasn't sure which subreddit would make the most sense, but if my goal would be to at some point seek investors for this, then asking investors makes the most sense.

Summary of questions for ease of reference:

1) What interest rate or return on investment do you aim for annually. 

2) Do you think you would be open to a model similar to what is listed? Investing in the future of another person with a guarantee of repayment and interest.

3) How would one go about finding those in their area interested in such a proposal? I assume calling an investment firm would be a no for privacy reasons, so would carpet bombing letters be the best approach? I assume such things are spam. Question is how to reach the audience.

investing,Creating the Bond Bubble - Role of the Stock Market,"All over the place they are touting that the stock market will crash and burn. Indeed, when you say there is a coming crash, everyone immediately assumes that means the stock market. It appears that the bulk of those who claim to be analysts are all proclaiming the coming stock market crash. This is typical since no one in the field has really be around for a collapse in government. In the United States, we had the Sovereign Debt collapse during the 1840s of many states who defaulted permanently on their bonds trying to bail out the banks after Andrew Jackson’s closure of the Second Bank of the United States. [Here](http://i0.wp.com/armstrongeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/913-ECM-1830-1839.jpg) is Wave #913 of the ECM. What is relative here is that the famous Panic of 1837 came on the half-cycle after the peak where the share market actually topped out in the USA during 1835. That wave bottomed in 1839 and thereafter began the State Sovereign Debt Defaults since Jackson had destroyed the central bank and the USA entered the age of Wildcat Banking where state banks issued money.

 The [share market](http://i1.wp.com/armstrongeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DJ1840s-SovDefaults.jpg?zoom=1.5&amp;resize=584%2C438) in the USA peaked in 1835 with the ECM and it declined for about 7 years into 1842. The Panic of 1837 unfolded as Jackson effectively adopted austerity demanding everything be paid in gold. That set off a massive deflationary wave and the closing of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836 set off a real nightmare. Jackson closed the bank because it had been funding political candidates who were his rivals. In this respect, Goldman Sachs has learned to pay both sides and bet on no one but themselves.

The above ECM chart of Wave #913 illustrates that the US share market bottomed in the chaos in 1842 as the massive deflationary wave set in thanks to Jackson’s austerity move. Yet once states began to permanently default in 1842, capital ran into private assets. We see the US share market bottomed with the deflation in 1842 and then rallied for 10 years.

 The State and Federal defaults in the USA go back further to the collapse of the Continental Congress and the reorganization of the United States where the constitution forbid the states from ever issuing money on their own once again. The transition to US dollars was not without its pain. There were wild gyrations and Hamilton directed the bank of New York to buy his paper to try to do the exact same type of stimulation the ECB and the Fed have engaged in today. The Panic of 1791 was also a banking crisis.

So How did the financial markets respond to such events domestically within the United States? The  Panic of 1791 was followed by a massive real estate bubble which then burst during the next Panic of 1792.

At this time, we see that there is the traditional risk of a correction in the share market that could set off the final stage of the bond bubble. Keep in mind this is not going to materialize in the long-end of bonds/bunds. What we are seeing is capital is not rushing into the 10 year or greater paper, it is rushing into the very short end. Rates there are negative as there is not enough short-term paper around to meet the demands to park cash.

We [still see](http://i2.wp.com/armstrongeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DJFOR-W-5-13-2015.jpg?zoom=1.5&amp;resize=584%2C438) May – July – September as key targets for turning points. Whatever we end up with in September should produce the opposite trend immediately thereafter. As we now head into the last week of May/first week of June, we should start to see the choppy trends begin.

It is more likely than not that we should see a retest of support that will scare people and cause them to believe the stock market will crash. The high in the Dow still remains March 2nd at 18,335 level. Support begins at the 17,153 level and a daily closing beneath that level will signal the correction is then possible. The key support lies back at 16,540 level. A drop back to that area in the weeks and months ahead should convince everyone to buy more government paper and complete the final bubble top in government debt.",finance,1431851814

I had a student interest free overdraft of £1,600 and a £2,200 bank loan (not student loan -- the biggest one I could get which involved the woman at the bank telling me to claim I was buying a car, not putting it towards tuition fees!) that I used to pay for my fifth postgraduate year (along with some money from my parents). I left home six months ago to go into a graduate professional position, where for the first two years I am a trainee on a relatively small salary before I qualify and take a jump in pay. 

So details: as at right now my bank balance is at -£1,350. I get paid in a fortnight. My overdraft is still £1,600 interest free (I have no idea when it starts to reduce) and my loan is around £1,850 left to pay off (I pay £55 a month). My phone bill comes out at around £65 (yes far too much but i am tied into the contract) Other monthly payments: rent (375), bills (100), food (200?), spotify/netflix/gym/cinema (60). I take home £1,350 after tax (in August that will go up to somewhere nearer £1,500). 

So £1350 - 855 = £495. At the moment this basically all goes on socialising, lunches at work (though I take a pack lunch probably three times a week), and other random things. I rarely buy clothes or anything nowadays.

Also did something stupid - work paid me an additional £1500 in October, and I pissed it up against a wall.  

On my income and expenses, do you think it is easily possible for me to start cutting my overdraft back and to try and start having a bit of money for holidays, clothes etc? Fed up of running out of money every month!

Cheers

personalfinance,Can you guys review a plan I made for my mom (family) after my dad passed away. I'm not sure if I'm doing this right.,"Hey everyone.
My father passed away last month, and I got his insurance benefits paid out so I sat down with my mom to review everything and came up with a plan but I have no experience so I'd appreciate someone elses opinon.

First let my say we've always been short on money even tho we had around 2500 - 3000€ combined income each month. This is above average in my country. But needless to say they 'had' to help all 3 of my siblings (I'm the youngest) by putting a down payment for a new car and then they would further pay for it themselves.

So to get to the numbers.  

**Current income:**  
- 800€/month - mother.  
- 360€/month - family pension that I'm recieving  
**€1160 TOTAL**  


**Expenses:**  
 - 50€ mom's phone bill (will lower to 25/mo. in Aug.)  
- 330€ family car payment  
- 225€ sister's car payment  
- 118€ Internet, Tv, Phone, two laptop installments  
- 30€ additional insurace  
- 12€ mandatory contribution to country's TV station  
- 4€ newspaper  
- 130€ electricity  
- 120€ health insurance  
- 30€ accident insurance (6€ for each)  
- 50€ goes toward moms credit card debt pay off  
- 80€ car insurance  
- 60€ parking garage  
- 145€ moms school  
- 150€ gasoline  
- 200€ food etc. (I'm pretty sure this could easily be 300€/mo. currently, but shouldn't be a problem to get it to 200€ with budgeting)  
- 420€ dad bank credit  
**€2154 TOTAL**  


**Debt:**  
- 4700€ dad's credit card debt  
- 17K bank loan (420€/mo., 3 years left)  
- 11,8K left for financed family car  
- 2K borrowed from uncle for funeral cost.  
**€35,5K TOTAL**  


**Plan:**  
I got 19K paid out of my dad's insurance so I was thinking that currently the most important thing would be to lower monthly expenses as much as possible. And being that his credit card debt has to be paid off and the money we borrowed for the funeral paid back I'm left with 12,3K.

And I can't pay off his bank loan, which is the highest expense, with that amount. Although it just hit me that minus interest I could perhaps get fairly close, but I'll have to stop at his bank to get exact info on interest rate, but I'm guessing this could be a viable option?

If I won't be able to pay off his bank loan (which I assume is most likely) I thought that paying off the car loan would be the second best option, but unfortunately it's on a fixed schedule so I'd have to pay the interest anyway, but being that this would lower my moms expenses for 330€ I see it as an option.
The second thing I said we'll do is split the living expenses among the four of us (mom, brother, sister &amp; me. Another brother is living on his own). So we would pay 123€ each (Internet, accident insurance, dog food, electricity and groceries) which would significantly lower her expenses. Also my sister will have to start paying for her own car (mom was paying for it for the time she was in college).

So if we pay off the car loan (11.8K) we'd be left with 500€ with which mom could pay the last two installments for her degree (290€), pay last 4 laptop installments (120€), and her last 3 phone installments (75€).
So with the above paid off and the expenses split among the four of us expenses would be **€1128 TOTAL** which would leave her with an extra 30€ which I suggested to add to the 50€/mo. credit card debt pay off.

Also she was promoted recently but public sector promotions are frozen till December so she'll get around 800€ in December and her salary will be higher for around 100€ or perhaps 300€ due to her degree being higher. But she is planning on getting a new job as soon as she finishes her degree anyway as that would almost double her salary (public sector salaries are very low here).

Do you see this plan working? I'm assuming paying off the bank loan should be a priority if I'll be able to pay it off completely? If I'm not able to pay off the bank loan should I pay off the car loan or seek other ways to pay off the bank loan, if so, what options do I even have? Also is it worth putting the rest of the money into those small monthly installments to pay them off completely?

Thanks for reading and any advice is much appreciated.",finance,1431859713

financialindependence,Amazed by other people's spending choices.,"My spouse and I are working very hard to build up our retirement savings and pay off our home. I feel like compared to the general public we're doing okish, but compared to this sub I feel quite behind. However, what truly is eye-opening is the exploding volcano of wastefulness around us. Right now it's our siblings and their spouses.

Sibling set #1. Live in a trailer on a large lot out in the country. If you think traditional homes are a poor investment, try a trailer. They don't even appreciate. Pretty sure they have a 30 year note on it because they've been living in it for close to 15 yrs and SIL recently told me they can't find a bank to refinance it b/c it's a manufactured home (I wonder what their interest rate is?! Probably 6-7% for that time period). They both work full time, kids go to private school (yet the public schools there are fine), and they have two giant 4 wheel drive vehicles (1 full size truck, 1 suv), plus assorted vehicles for the country life: a tractor (no, not a lawn mower, an actual farm tractor. They have no crops), a 4-wheeler, a side-by-side atv, a large camping trailer, and yesterday I found out they bought a boat. They are a significant drive from any body of water. But the real kicker is they bought an airplane hanger and a plane.

Sibling set #2. More income than the other set, yet similar lifestyle, now that I think about it. Just a more expensive lifestyle/house. House out in the country, which just means a longer drive to private school for the kid in the next town (public schools are fine there as well). Full size truck, classic car, more expensive side-by-side atv. They recently adopted a baby. SIL told me they had an unexpected adoption cost to the tune of $30k, so they are throwing themselves a fundraiser. Yet they spent over $20k last year for their side-by-side atv, and they also went on an all-inclusive vacay to Mexico just a month before the baby was born. They also received an approx $20k inheritance from a family member in 2013. I'm completely sympathetic to the costs of infertility and adoption (we've also been through both), but the fundraiser angle rubs me the wrong way. Because they aren't needy financially. They just spend too much.",finance,1431867047

I have ~630 credit score, and don't know that my $40,000/year salary would qualify for me to refinance either. 

My question is, would the Student Loan Repayment (would repay all of the federal loans, if I understand) and signing bonus (up to $20,000) from joining the reserves or national guard be worth the 6 year commitment that it requires. 

I don't have any experience with the military. I have no idea if they'll actually try to back out of these payments, as I've read.

I graduated from University of Santa Barbara mid-September 2013 with a Humanities degree. A close family member in the Fremont area offered me a place to stay, as well as dinners, free of charge until I got my footing in the real world. I landed a retail banking job somewhere in December 2013. I have a couple of questions, bolded them to help with visibility. 

**Income**

1. ~$35,000.00 gross from my full time position

1. ~$2,00.00 extra in side + hobby income

**Monthly Expenses**

1. Lunch: ~$60.00 a month. My workplace is quite close to Chinatown. I would order a lunchbox plus soup for about $5.00-$5.50 and split it between two days. 

1. BART: ~$220.00 a month. I commute through the Bay Area Rapid Transit. The whole commute is probably around an hour and a half, including my walks to and from the BART stations.

1. Rent: $100.00 a month. I love you, close family member. I had the option to move to Daly City with some friends for about $500.00 a month (closer to $410.00 because I would save on BART fares). I decided to stay for the time being as I'm pretty happy here and they love having me stay with them.

**Debts**

1. Student Loans: $25,759.00 principal with $1,377,85 interest during school. Within the last year and five months of work, I made 34 total payments and the total balance sits at $7,003.00. After my next payment, all remaining balance will be at 3.125%  interest rate. I'm planning to pay the rest down slowly ($250.00 each month) until I put more money into retirement. **Any oppositions to this plan?**

**Savings**

1. All checkings + savings account: $250.00 at all times for lunch money and commute. I know I should have an emergency fund, but I feel that I can hold off on that now because of my current living arrangement and expenses. I feel like anything short of a disaster can be paid using my credit card for the time being. Afterwards, I would budget the next month to pay it off on time. Once I maxed 2015 Roth IRA contributions and paid off the remainder of my student loans, I hope to save around $3,000.00 in a high interest savings account online. **Thoughts?**

1. Roth IRA: $6,900.00 contribution ($7,100.00 current balance) in VTTSX (2060 retirement fund). I did not think to put money into a Roth IRA for the first four months of 2014. Thinking back I would have tried to max the 2013 limit before paying my student loans aggressively. Currently, I have maxed 2014 contributions and started on 2015. I know once I hit the $10,000.00 mark I can change to VTSAX for the lower expense ratio, but **what about the other funds in my currently target  date retirement fund? Will I need $10,000.00 in order to get admiral shares in those as well?**

1. 401(k): $8,300.00 vested ($9,660.00 account value). My contribution rate changes every couple of months depending on what goals I set myself. All other funds available are much higher expense ~.60%-1.0+%. **Opinions on this spread? Should my Roth IRA be invested elsewhere if my 401(k) is mostly US stock market?**

* VFIAX: 80% (.05% gross expense)
* VIMAX: 10% (.09% gross expense)
* VSMAX: 10% (.09% gross expense)

**Current Job Search**

I have been searching for a new position in the San Francisco area for about two months now. There are no openings in the internal departments I am interested in (inquired with my recruiter) and I do not see much room for advancing in the retail banking side for the next couple of years. My current boss and coworkers encouraged me to find a better position which prompted my search. 

Most of my work experience is in customer facing roles from my full time job and side income. I narrowed my search down to two areas starting: loan processing/verification roles in peer to peer lending, and customer support/advocacy roles in tech companies.

1. I applied to Prosper Marketplace and Lending Club for the loan processing/verification roles. I actually went in to interview at Prosper, but did not manage to receive an offer. 

1. I applied to a couple of tech companies with interesting products, but nothing so far. Phone interviews and two in person interviews. No offers.

I feel like my success rate has been improving, at least with getting a response. I have been making unique cover letters and resume changes for each application. However, I applied to all the companies I found interesting already. **Which website do you guys use to research interesting companies?**

Also, I thought about moving to maybe Seattle or Orange County. I hear Minneapolis is pretty awesome too. **Any advice about moving or insight into these cities?**

I tried looking up networking opportunities in the Bay Area as well. Mostly tried Meetup, but most groups involved in tech are usually catered to developers. **Any advice for networking?**",finance,1431892890

financialindependence,Critique my plan please,"I'm 39, had a setback with the -ex who liked debt and spending, she's out of the picture, and I went from very much less than nothing to 240k net worth in a few years. My take home after taxes is 164k/year. Expenses are 55k/year (high cost of living place), and I'm renting the bare bones apt I can find which covers girlfriend/student(school is paid for thanks thanks to grants).  That means $108k/year is saved, half of that is 401k/IRA, other half is taxable accounts (index funds). This means 66% of my total take home is being saved. [According to MMM](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) I can retire in 10 years. But I plan to live in a lower cost of living area for retirement so I can cut that down by retiring elsewhere.


For the 401k, 27k comes from me and a generous employer match, 53k(401k max)-27k = $26k goes to after tax which I'll roll over to an IRA every year. Never done this before but I read that this is recently possible. That means 27k/year goes to pre-tax 401k, 5500(backdoor)+26000= $31500 will be stuffed into a roth.  I'm banking on an ira ladder + taxable accounts so I can retire early. 

Putting it all together, each year I'll invest:

personalfinance,"How much should I save for retirement, on top of Railroad Retirement contributions?","Hello! I tried searching, but couldn't find a satisfactory answer. 

Background: I'm 25, and just started working for a major railroad company. The job is blue collar, pays decent enough for my background and lack of higher education, and I look to do it for the rest of my life (with promotions and such). 

30% of each paycheck is automatically sent to the Railroad Retirement Board. I have state and federal taxes on top of that. I still have some leftover after all that, and am working towards an emergency fund at the moment. 

So my question is: **how much should I put away into a retirement fund, after my current contributions?** I look to retire on time (30-ish years), and want to live comfortably, but not lavishly. 

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Thanks in advance!",finance,1431904000
personalfinance,A little credit card advice,"I want to share two tidbits that I do regarding my credit card. For information purposes, I use a Discover credit card and in this discussion I am only referring to Discover but I'm sure these tips carryover to other credit cards. 

The first thing to do is to put the cash advance (CA) limit to zero. The reason for this is that the interest rate on CA is higher than your credit card rate and also it prevents merchants from charging a purchase as CA without you knowing. 

The second thing to do is to make all purchases with your credit card. The amount of protections on my credit card are quite numerous- price matching, dispute/fraud protection, cash back for shopping at certain places, extra warranty, a paper trail to keep track of your expenses and my credit card even allows me to return something to them even if the place where I purchased it refuses to accept it.",finance,1431904024
financialindependence,What are your assumptions?,"As the title states, what are your assumptions for your quest to FI? I'm currently about a third of the way there (8.35x annual expenses saved - about 5.5 years to go), and I've been meaning to check with everyone else to see how they build their projections. Without further ado:

* Overall portfolio has an annualized 7% RoR; current-year contributions will received a halved rate of 3.5% due to DCA. Rudimentary.
* The bonds portion of my portfolio will not have a RoR.
* Expenses are tracked each month, and I'm *presuming* they remain constant, though I have a goal expense rate about 15% lower than current; my current spending rate is about 33% lower than before MMM/this sub, and while I'll eventually have an expense floor as I progress, I'm not there yet. Once that occurs, I'll revise my assumptions.
* Once I reduce expenses in what I consider a permanent basis, I skim it off the top and increase my automatic contributions to Vanguard.
* I'll receive 4% annual raises, which in turn affects my 401k matching contributions. This is conservative; my lowest has been 6%, but they'll slow as I continue to make more. Each year's net gain will ultimately be automatically invested, however I don't actually calculate these future contributions into my portfolio - that will be at the time of raise-received.
* My wife will not receive annual raises; I only presume this as she's in her first year; this is conservative.
* My wife and I continue to max 401ks (DCA) and Roth IRA (DCA). Although I assume it, I haven't been unable to fully contribute to our Roths at year start.
* Once I'm at 25x annual expenses (~5.5 years out), I'll be switching to part-time (16 hours weekly). This keeps me on decent, federal health-insurance, minor matching of my 401k, and a safe withdrawal rate of 0% (rather, a negative rate - I'll still have a bit leftover when working part-time). I'll likely do this until something else presents itself or just plain fatigue.
* Finally, nothing entirely unexpected. No kids, no unexpected major costs, and so on. The kids piece might change, but I'll address it then and push back my projections accordingly. 

I find the more conservative the assumptions, the more positive occurrences outside my norm occur. Anyway, enough about me - what are your assumptions?

I've spoken with many people in the industry and all I've been hearing are positive things. Many smaller banks are interested in decentralized ledgers and IOU systems.

personalfinance,Retirement and Buying a House,"I've read through the wiki and used the search feature. I know you see a lot of these ""what should I do with $xxx"" posts, so I'm a little hesitant to post....but, I think my situation is a little different than what normally pops up, though, and I would like some advice. 

My husband and I are both in the military (E6) and stationed overseas. We both have 10 years left until we can retire from active duty and receive our military pensions (which is 50% of our base pay; we're both anticipating to retire at least as an E7 and hopefully O3....[pay charts here](http://www.dfas.mil/militarymembers.html) .)

We each have 20k in a Roth, and we are both saving 600 a month in it. 

I have another 20k in mutual funds that I was saving specifically for a house. I put about 600 a month in that as well. He's got another 20k spread out through CDs and savings accounts. We have an emergency savings fund built up, as well. We have no debt, not even cars or loans.

Upon reviewing our budget, and making a few tweaks here and there, we have about $2000 ($1000 in each of our pay checks) extra.

My goal, upon retiring from the Navy in ten years, is to not have to work unless I want to do so. I want to be a soccer mom and dote on my children. When my husband retires from the military, he wants to get another job, a federal one, so he can pull that retirement as well. 

The big discussion we are having is this: 

I want to buy our house outright when we return to America (roughly 5 years; 2k a month x 60 months + interest + what we have in our mutual funds/savings should get us close to 200,000 which is a modest house in the area we want to retire) That means we won't have a monthly house payment, which lessens projected expenses by a significant amount. 

My husband would rather save that extra money in our Roths. The problem I have with this is we can't touch that money until much later than 10 years down the line.

Paying thousands of dollars in interest on a house makes me feel queasy. 

What's the best way to meet both our goals? What's the best thing to do with that $2000 extra a month?",finance,1431914891

Via Black's Law Dictionary, just because I was curious what ""money"" meant in leagalese, and it appears to only mean currency issued by a government.
 
What is MONEY?

A general, indefinite term for the measure and representative of value; currency; the circulating medium ; cash. “Money” is a generic term, and embraces every description of coin or bank-notes recognized by common consent as a representative of value in effecting exchanges of property or payment of debts. Hopson v. Fountain. 5 Humph. (Tenn.) 140. Money is used in a specific and also in a general and more comprehensive sense. In its specific sense, **it means what is coined or stamped by public authority, and has its determinate value fixed by governments.** In its more comprehensive and general sense, it means wealth.

Bitcoin is NOT coined nor stamped by public authority and has no value determined by governments. It sounds like currency is only money if the IMF controlled it's issuance?

I will be graduating with a BA in Sociology and I also have an Associates in Math &amp; Science. I had a solid public health internship for a year and have worked a part-time job for 6+ years and am making $14 an hour plus tips (I'm considered a manager I guess). 

I have also been living with my boyfriend rent free and bill free for almost a year. Sold my car in January because it has 190k miles on it and need several thousand dollars in work. 

My only monthly expense currently is my phone bill (100/month) and my credit card bill which has been about 100/month as well. I also have $10,000 in loans (federal unsubsidized).

First thing I want to do is buy a lightly used car. Subaru Legacy preferably for about $16,000. I have $8,000 saved but was only planning on putting $5,000 down so I have some money to fall back on. I figure my insurance will be about 100/month and my payments will be about 180/month. I will not go over 200/month for a payment. Is this a good idea? Would it be better to lease? 

I currently make $14 an hour plus tips but I'm only guaranteed 12 hours. Although sometimes I work more (this week I worked 46) sometimes it's only 12. I got a job offer from a friends father who is a doctor and needs a front desk person. It only pays $12 an hour but it's consistent MWF $300 a week paycheck. I like that it's consistent and I don't have to work weekends. I also want to go into nursing or dental hygiene so I think I could benefit from the experience in a medical setting. 

I want to start giving my boyfriend money for rent and bills even though he tells me no. He makes about $50,000 and currently paying $1,400/month for rent, utilities, cable/wifi. What kind of money can I contribute without completely draining myself of all funds? 

My parents cannot contribute at all and I am definitely going back to school probably in-state but that won't be for a while.

I seem to have checked off most of the things on the typical to-do list and have some money left over. If you guys could chime in and give your opinion on what I should consider doing, it'd be greatly appreciated. Here's a summary of my finances. 

1) No debt, except this career starter loan. I'm not particularly worried about paying off this loan since the interest rate is very low and I'll have a guaranteed income once I commission into the Navy. My only expense is my monthly credit card bill which is usually around 350, usually spent on eating out, clothes, etc. 

2) I get paid $300/month, which will increase to around 400-500 starting August. So basically my monthly pay covers my credit card bill each month.

3) I've started/maxed my Roth IRA for 2015. 

4) Invested in S. Korean stock market which is doing pretty well. 

5) paid for a very memorable vacation to Thailand for springbreak. (memories and friendships are worth a lot more than cash!)

investing,Effects of Various Economic Conditions on the Markets,"When I asked Pauline about writing a second guest post here, she suggested I talk about factors that will affect the average investor’s retirement nest egg. So in this post, I’ll be discussing the various economic and historical conditions that will affect investors in the medium tern (1-5 years) and long term future (5 to 10 years out), and how you can prepare yourself when each of these conditions hit.

Inflation
Without going into the arcane and pointless details, I’ll explain QE (quantitative easing) in good ole’ plain English. QE is the Federal Reserve’s way of printing money, thereby injecting more and more liquidity (money) into the financial system. Bernake (Fed Chairman) believes that this will pull the American economy out of the muck for good, and right now, whether this is working or not is still questionable.

HOWEVER, quantitative easing does have a problem – the printing of money theoretically speaking should cause inflation. But since QE first began, inflation has been virtually non-existent. How come?

According to theory, printing money causes inflation. BUT, what the economy has been experiencing post-recession is a deflationary environment. The economy isn’t doing too well, and prices should be declining. But with the Fed’s printing of money, the deflation is negated, resulting in zero inflation.

However, sooner or later (probably sooner, along the lines of 1 – 2 years) inflation is going to (finally) pick up. Why? Think of it this way. Deflation has always existed, and the Fed’s printing of money has been negating this deflation. However, soon that negation will be over (when the inflation is sufficient enough to totally negate the deflation), and the printing of money will finally cause real inflation.

So what do you do when inflation hits? Historically speaking, investors think that inflation is bad for stocks. That’s a huge misconception. This misconception only exists because stocks went flat in the 1970s when inflation was huge. HOWEVER, the 1970s were an anomaly – we experienced stagflation, when inflation was coupled with a sagging economy. In most cases, inflation occurs in a growing economy (or in today’s case, a nominally growing GDP). I believe that this time around, the recovery is real and that we’re not going to experience stagflation.

Hence, I think that buying stocks would be great when inflation hits. When inflation comes around, currencies get devalued and nominally speaking stock prices rise, leading to greater returns for equity investors.

Devaluation
Devaluation is closely linked to inflation – when governments print money, the real value of their currencies becomes devalued. Whenever currencies get devalued, all hard assets such as stocks and commodities shoot up in price. Speaking of commodities…

The Once in a Lifetime Opportunity
People believe that precious metals are a hedge against an economic downturn. Again, that’s a misconception. When the 2008 recession hit, precious metals (gold and silver) actually fell the hardest. This misconception originates (again) from the 1970s when a crappy economy was coupled with soaring gold and silver prices.

Precious metals rose in the 1970s not because of the poor economy but because of inflation. The 1970s were a rare case of stagflation, something that doesn’t fit in with today. Currently, the economy is humming along, but inflation will be a big issue. Thus, when inflation starts to creep up it will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for medium term investors who are willing to hold onto their gold and silver positions for at least a year.

The Fight for Resources
There’s a prime fundamental reason (besides inflation) that supports the rise in commodity prices (especially gold and silver). It’s simple. We have fewer and fewer resources to feed a larger and larger population. When Thomas Malthus first predicted that the world would end (this was back in 1798), he forgot to factor in technology. Technological improvements can increase the efficiency at which we extract our resources. HOWEVER, even technology has a limit. The efficiency is ultimately limited to the amount of resources we have. Currently, the world is reaching a turning point. If all the emerging market nations start to consume at the rate Americans do, the world’s resources would be gone sooner rather than later. When the demand for raw materials goes up and the supply goes down, prices will soar.

Historical Charts
You’ve all heard it – historically, the U.S. stock market has yielded (on average) 7.5% returns. That’s actually a really clever lie concocted by brokers and financial groups to get you to purchase equities.

The “average of 7.5%” is from the post-War period. If you look at a different time frame, such as if you were to include the Great Depression, the “average rate of return” is a lot less. That’s what the financial industry does – repackaging facts to make them look better than when they first came in.

The post-war period is actually an anomaly, a period of unprecedented economic growth that is unlikely to be repeated again in the near future. This growth was caused by major technological revolutions, from household appliances to computers to the internet and high speed communications. Today? Come on guys – the market is going to grow at 7.5% with a bunch of undergrads making $0.99 iPhone apps.

My point is, if the stock market is going to pick up its pace in the long run, it needs to be supported by major technological leaps. Unfortunately, since the dawn of the internet our society’s brightest have been attracted towards the fast money of internet riches, drawn away from solid industries that actually contribute to mankind’s life (think of space mining, green energy – the capital intensive industries). Thus, without any major technological revolutions happening right now how can we expect economic and market growth to pick up? We can’t. There’s no driver for the growth engine.

The Summary
To sum it all up, I’m going to divide things into two time frames. The medium time frame is the 1-5 year outlook, whereas the long term outlook is 5-20 years.

For the medium outlook, things are looking decidedly positive. Once inflation picks up (which is inevitable with all the money printing), stocks and commodities are going to soar, particularly gold and silver whose bull markets aren’t over.

However, the long term is less positive. Sure, the stock market will still experience long term bull markets. But I don’t think the average rate of return will be 7.5% anymore, unless we experience another major technological breakthrough. The problem is that these breakthroughs are the results of years and years of work, something that hasn’t happened thanks to all our smartest engineers being attracted to industries that do not really contribute that much to mankind.

I grew up incredibly poor, have been homeless once, and close to it more times than I'd like to count.  Money has never NOT been an issue, except for a brief few years where my mom was married to a multi-millionaire, and we did things like ""go yachting"" and ""go to the summer house"" when I was 10-13 years old.  Needless to say, both my view of, and relationship with money is incredibly not okay, especially for an adult.

I'm 26 years old now, and recently started a new, incredibly secure job as a professional in a global industry.  With this job comes a 401(k), PTO, healthcare, and a host of other things I've never had before, so I've decided that it's time to get my (financial) shit together.

So, for starters, here is a copy+paste of my credit report, current score is 586
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/120TE0SPWtplC8xQ8loGaWi_eLbu4iPlo0WZKBLFnHzE/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true

I started college at a private university at 16 to try to get away from insane family problems that are a whole different thread, but needless to say this screwed me later.  I don't think I understood what I was signing when they pushed papers at me saying ""sign this for money!"" and it fucked me pretty hard, but hey, my fault.  These have sat in collections for a long time, and finally got paid off with my National Guard enlistment bonus + them taking my tax returns every single year.

*Total Expenses	$2,680*

This (technically) leaves me with *$602.60* after everything.

Rent is WAY expensive.  My old roommate tragically took his own life in December.  I was having a rough time, so I let my best-friend from childhood move in with me rent-free, pretty much for moral support.  I was making ~$5000/month at my old job (working 70 hour weeks, so most of that is OT mind you), so it wasn't a huge issue then.  I started my new job at the end of last month, and make more hourly, and have benefits, and am a permanent (not contract) employee, but OT is non-existent.  The good news is that she has found a job, and will start paying her half of the rent come the first of next month, so this will drop to $700.  

Internet is also expensive.  I worked from home a lot at my old job, which required me to have a fast, stable connection, so the $100 is for 100meg cable.  This can be lowered.  Not gonna like it, but I'll do it.

Phone is about to drop from $85 to $10, due to my new employer being my phone company.  

Gas is a ballpark, but seems about right.  I don't really drive anywhere, except to and from work (15 minutes each way) and the 2 hour drive to National Guard weekend once a month.  

Food is ballparked, yet outrageous.  I eat out pretty much every meal, but have been working on this for the past two weeks, and have eaten out ~5 times in that period, which I still understand is a lot.

Netflix is... netflix.  

CreditCheck is credit monitoring/my credit report from Equifax.  This can stay or go, I'm not sure what you would recommend.

Entertainment is also ballparked.  I figure this is about what I spend on a couple of concerts or whatever.  I try very hard to not go out and blow money, so I hermit life it most of the time.  

Alcohol might as well go with entertainment.  Again, I try to not go out because I'll wind up leaving with a $120 bar tab.

Tobacco - I chew a can every 2 days of copenhagen.  Yes, I should stop.  Realistically, I probably won't.

Snacks - I like to grab a bag of M&amp;M's and a poweraid before work.  This coupled with Vyvanse usually lets me get through the work day without getting too hungry, so I very rarely spend money for food at work.  

I have $537.83 in my bank account.  

Unfortunately for me, I'm a dumbass and screwed up my time card for the past two weeks, so I only got paid $607.93.
Also unfortunately, I had 0 savings when I changed jobs, and rent has NOT been paid this month.  I have $650 in cash from my roommate + selling things on craigslist to try to pay rent,plus the $537.83 but, after math, I'm still negative a few hundred in being able to pay rent, and I've just about sold everything I can.

So, /r/personalfinance, please help me get my shit together.  The most important thing right now is being able to come up with a way to pay rent.  As bad of an idea as it is, I think my only option might be to get a payday loan for a few hundred, leaving me just enough to pb&amp;j it until the 30th when I would get paid, which would then go immediately to rent again, putting me behind until the 15th of next month.  I have no family that I could ask to borrow the money from, and all of my friends are just as broke as I am right now.  

I think priority #2 would be paying off everything on my credit report as quickly as possible.  Afterwards, trying to get an emergency fund going, and then, hopefully, putting money into my 401(k).

In the next 2 months, I should be getting a raise that will probably put me close to, if not at $30/hr, but it could also be a lot less.

I'm also deadly serious about trying to fix my credit score.  My car, although it is paid off, is quickly approaching it's end-of-life, with somewhere near 260,000 pretty rough miles on it.  I tried to buy a car last December as mine was having odd electrical issues that I've now fixed, and couldn't get a loan ANYWHERE except from shady used-car dealers that tried to tell me that a 29% interest rate is a good deal, which, while it might be a good deal for someone with credit as bad as mine, I knew better than to pay that much for another shitty car.

Please ya'll, help me figure my shit out.  I'm quickly approaching my 30's, and don't want to ever put a wife or kids through the financial mess that I grew up with, and that I currently have for myself.  I'm sick of being late on rent.  I'm sick of having to plead with company x to give me a few weeks to pay some bill that's now outrageous because I've ignored it.  I'm sick of debt collectors calling.  I'm sick of being stressed out about money.  I'm tired of it.

personalfinance,"Mother giving money to use for vehicle, don't want to accidently structure it based off some bad advice from Wells Fargo.","Throwaway obv, but I'm sure if the IRS cared they could figured it out.

My mother is planning on giving my wife and I $15k to use towards a new vehicle that we are buying in a few months.  The idgets at Wells Fargo told her that the Feds investigate any deposits over 10k, which, working at a credit union myself, I know is a lie.  While I know that when there is over 10k in CASH brought in, a CTR must be done, CTRs are not done for checks unless the check is being turned into cash.  I have businesses come in all the time with checks well over 10k being deposited that I know I don't have to do CTRs for, and the same for personal accounts too.

So, in order to follow what the Wells Fargo people said, my mother is planning on making out one check fro 7500 to me, and one for the same amount for my wife.  She wants us to deposit them into our respective accounts, and after the check clears, she wants us to transfer the 7500 from my wife's account into my account.

Going off what I've known for working at a CU for over a year, this sounds like structuring, even though the deposits are checks.

Am I wrong in assuming that even though the checks are being deposited and just transferred that it is still structuring, or because there is no actual currency being withdrawn, this is not structuring?",finance,1431928359

Over the past 3 years, we have been renting a house in a suburb of Sydney, Australia for $600 per week. We have been able to save approximately $150,000 in a savings account. We currently get about 4% interest on that amount.  

In the next ~12 months, we would like to have our first child, and my wife would like to take (ideally 12 months) off work to care for him/her. 

We are struggling with what we should do with the $150,000 in the bank at present. The local housing market has been skyrocketing lately, and a lot of our friends have made a tidy ""on paper"" profit buying suburban apartments and sitting back and watching the market increase in value.

Interest rates are at an all time low, locally, and last I heard, the local property market has increased by 15% since January, and by about 30-40% in the last 12-24 months. Its suddenly trendy for everyone in Sydney to own an ""investment property"" and my wife keenly feels that social pressure.

For context, a 2 bedroom suburban apartment, 10km from the Sydney CBD costs about $700,000 AU. Basic, everyday houses (the average, middle class kind) in that same vein start at about $1.2 million AU. We've been pre-approved for an ""interest only"" loan of 900k (less than I suspect we would otherwise have been approved for because I'm self-employed). 

Unfortunately, a house that we would like to actually live in is well and truly out of our budget, so real estate wise, our only option seems to be to rent a home we like, and invest the money we save in the hope that we can afford to buy later. 

Everyone we know is telling us that ""property never goes down in value"" and that we need to ""get a foot on the ladder anyway"". I am concerned that this is a bubble, and we would be buying in at the top. That said, I've been saying that for 5 years now, and I somehow it keeps going up.

Chicago FED president Charles Evans reiterated his stance once more today, no rate hike in 2015 but first one in 2016. Chart courtesy Sober look.

* Mr. Evans said that he prefers overshooting the 2% inflation target in the medium term to guarantee that there is enough upward momentum in inflation to sustain rate hike. According to him unemployment is still higher by half a percentage point. So as per him, FED needs to continue being accommodative and not to rush things.

Charles Evans is a known dove in the FOMC committee and he is probably the most dovish member.

* In previous comments he said that he will be pursuing his colleagues to consider first rate hike in 2016. Notably market participants are also expecting first hike in January 2016, as measured from fed funds rate future.

Impact -

As of immediate, market is not to pay much attention to his remarks as though it remains unchanged from previous versions. However recent weakness in economic releases from the US to grow Charles Evans argument stronger and more members are likely to join his camp.

Dollar is to continue trading weak versus major counterparts. Dollar index is currently trading at 93.65, up 0.45% today. Major focus is on FOMC meeting in June, about one month from now.

personalfinance,To the 22 Year Old Seeking Budgeting Help,"You asked for help and deleted before I finished my comment lol. 

Here's my thoughts: 

Ok, Here's your new game plan as I see it. 
 Strategy: 
1) Reduce Credit Debt Systematically
2) Build Savings
3) Reduce Costs

1) Budget Has $573 Unaccounted for. Using only this, here is what you should consider doing: 

1. CC 1 - Pay $614 June, $614 July, $155 August - Paid Off
2. CC 2 - Pay $486 August, $435 September - Paid Off
3. CC 3 - Pay $231 September, $204 October - Paid Off

2) Now: 

Take remaining in budget and build savings:

1. October Goal - $462
2. November Goal - $666
3. December Goal - $666
Total Saved by December - $1,796

3)
1. Haircut - Reduce this to $25/month - June to Dec - Save $105 ($15.00/saved)
2. Misc - If it is not that important to be named it is WASTE - Save $150/month June to Dec - $1,050
Total Saved By December - $1,155

Now combine savings from waste, budget left over and cost reduction and by December of 2015 you will have $2,951 in the BANK and no Credit Card Debt. 

In the next 7 Months you will change you Net Worth by $5,690 (negative credit card debt and new savings) 

Other considerations, your loans - are they student loans? If so, how much do you owe on each, what are the interest rates and years remaining? 

How long do you plan to live at home? 

Do you pay your own cell phone plan? or do your parents? 

Car payment is almost 23% of income - High 

How often do you eat out? - Large $$$ Waste 
How often do you entertain - movies, bar, shows, sports events? - plan and budget for it 
Do you buy birthday, holiday presents? - plan and budget for it 

Buy Used Car - Pay down Loans First before getting a new car 

Have you considered getting a 2nd job - waiter or bartender can earn you $100-$400 a shift at a busy place - increase income by 100%

Presuming you work 8am to 5pm Monday through Friday that leaves you with 24 hours on the weekend (12 hours sat and 12 hour sun) and 6 hours per week night or 30 hours per work week.  If you can fill this same time you have now 54 hours of working time to earn money. 

At a minimum $10/hr that's $540/week or $2,160 a month.  

I have a full time executive role at 60 hours/week and a side job of 20 hours a week.  This allows me to live to a level of comfort, entertainment and debt reduction that is satisfying. 

You're 22.  Pay off your 3 cc, pay off your loans in the next 4 years and at my age, 26, you're debt free and have $10K+ in the bank for a down payment on a house or whatever you want.

This past semester a full load (15 credits) cost me roughly $3,200 (USD) I'm looking to take on the next two semesters going to school living near campus (because they don't have a student living area, yay community college). Which in the last ad for the nearest apartment building would cost me around $4k for an academic year (9 months) and when I add it all up for just school and living on my own costs me around $10,400. For good measure I put on another $2k guessing for internet (for homework needs), food, toiletries and so on. Which leaves me with a total estimate of $12,400 it will cost me for the next two semesters. That's just the school debts.

Now to my income. I make $8.00 an hour working at a bar that just put me on full time and are expecting to get me at most 35 hours a week. Roughly a minimum of 30 a week. Which makes me about $240 every week before taxes at the 30 hours. Plus tips which are so much of a variable that I can't actually come to an estimate on what I make weekly on those. So on income alone at 30 hours a week for the next month I came up with a total of $2,880 which is a small fraction of what I need for school. One of the big problems is for myself is I'm under academic and financial probation due to past semesters before I buckled myself down and said I'm getting this degree. So these last two semesters I was only allowed to borrow (all federal loans) $2500 and with financial my school was mostly paid for except around $1,500 for what financial aid didn't cover living from home that year. 

What should I do with the little money I'm making to help myself pay for my tuition and other bills and necessities for this coming school year? Oh also the nearest high paying jobs ($12+) aren't hiring because they had enough people show up from the year before.

My sense that buying into a bond index fund (VBMFX, for example) is a good deal right now if we assume the interest rate will go up in the next bit.

personalfinance,Qualified for Hawaii state Medicaid. Any reason NOT to enroll?,"I'm recently unemployed in Hawaii and need health coverage. I was planning on buying my own insurance through the state's marketplace (via Affordable Care Act/Obamacare). They told me I would probably qualify for discounted/subsidized insurance but had to apply to the state Medicaid program first. Surprisingly, I got accepted.

My questions:

1. Are there any reasons NOT to enroll in Medicaid if I honestly qualify for it? The alternative is buying my own private insurance (hopefully subsidized?) via the cheapest barebones plan (""Bronze"" or ""Catastrophic"" types).

2. Does my enrollment in Medicaid affect my credit history/score at all? Or limit future benefits I might receive (e.g. Social Security?)

3. Did the state Medicaid office (""Med-Quest"" in Hawaii) make an error (details below)? I'm guessing they only consider modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) now and not any kind of asset test?

4. I'm healthy, young and active. Is Medicaid enough? Would private ACA Bronze or Catastrophic coverage be enough? At least until I find new employment again?

5. I travel quite a bit. My main concern is emergency coverage away from Hawaii. Medicaid is nationwide right? 


facts:

* ~$23,000 adjusted gross income (from dividends, interest, IRA distributions, capital gains, etc. as reported in 2014 income tax filings; excluding my W-2 earned income)

* Hawaii has a higher federal poverty level (FPL) than the mainland; source https://www.healthcare.gov/qualifying-for-lower-costs-ak-hi/

personalfinance,Fiance and I got sweet jobs abroad and making more than ever - but it may only last for a few years. How we do best take advantage of this?,"Here's my general situation, and I could really use some advice or recommendations for other reading. 

I am 33,M, American. Engaged and will be married June 2016. 

I currently make about $88k in base pay and my fiance makes about $68k. We both work for the same company. 

We were recently put on an overseas assignment which has been fantastic financially. In addition to our salaries, we each get an additional 40% in premium pay (danger and hardship), each about $10k / year in cost-of-living adjustment, and we get our housing provided which is approximately a total of $17,000 / year which is split and applied to both of our taxes. This all gets rolled up into my total reported income which ended up being about $134k on my W-2 last year. 

We will be on these assignments at least through this year, hopefully another few years if we play our cards right. 

From my understanding, after 2015 is done we will qualify for foreign earned income tax exclusion in the US and be able to reclaim most federal and state taxes paid on the first $100k each starting from February 2014 - when we moved. This will be through bona fide residency test - we spent too much time in the US to qualify now under the physical presence test (both our parents had health issues so we extended our christmas leave a bit longer to spend time). 

Here's our current strategy. 
1) Max out 401k (company matches 25% with no limit)

2) Slaughter my student loans: about $135k at a blended interest rate of about 7.5%. I'm prioritizing the largest interest rate first. I'm also looking at refinancing with a private lender to get a lower rate. If we can keep these positions for 2-3 years, my loans should be gone. 

3) My fiance is putting savings away for us to have a downpayment ready when we move back to the US. We normally live in the DC area, so need a pretty big downpayment. 

4) We've already got a good nestegg set aside for emergencies, etc. So comfortable there. 

5) We have no credit card debt. We use one card for items and then pay off in full each month. 

Here are some questions: 

1) I've been considering opening a Betterment account to do a Roth IRA, but from what I've been reading it appears that I'll be outside of the income level. Does this seem true? 

2) Should I just ignore that initial strategy and focus on throwing everything I have at loans? 

3) If I can't contribute to an IRA-type mechanism, are there other products or strategies I should consider? 

4) My credit isn't great. Right out of graduate school, I was stupid and ignored some student loan payments so the biggest dings are a bunch of late payments. What approach would do the most to help me improve my credit?

personalfinance,[Auto] Want to finance a used car. Car Insurance going up to $200+/mo after first accident.,"Hi PF, I'm in a stressful situation.

Last month I was in my first at-fault car accident (Damages in excess of $1,000 and bodily injury — I'm a little annoyed with the ruling because no one was injured, and the car I hit isn't even worth $1,000 — but it doesn't seem there is anything I can do about it). 

Anyway — I had been driving my 1994 Honda Accord that I'd had for 8 years. I paid only $50/mo for liability only (50k/100k property damage) insurance on it. After the wreck, the car still ran, but it wasn't drivable, so I sold it and decided it was time for an upgrade.

I was approved for a 2% interest loan from my local credit union, and I was ready to start shopping for a 2006-2009 Toyota/Honda/Mazda. I decided to gather insurance quotes online before committing to anything, and I sent my agent an email with a few example cars to have her run real quotes for me. 

I was looking at $500 deductibles for collision and comprehensive, and 50k/100k property damage limits. She got back to me and said that car insurance would be $170 for the next month or two, and then it *might* go up to $270 during renewal if the accident is reflected.

I know that because I'm financing I should expect the insurance to cost more. I also know that my accident will raise my rates as well. But I feel that $270 seems very high. Esurance quoted me for $214/mo if I change my deductibles to $1,000 (which I could do).

I am almost considering just not purchasing a car, or purchasing another very cheap car and not having full coverage. I don't drive that often — I take a bus to work. A car would strictly be for running errands, getting out on the weekends, etc. For the last month or so I haven't been getting out at all because I don't have a car, and it's really starting to wear on me. On the other hand, spending $200+ a month on car insurance for something that is parked the majority of the time would also wear on me.

I'm crushed because I thought I was picking out a reasonable, safe car, and I had a good interest rate, and I was doing everything so responsibly. Am I out of line? Is this actually a fairly normal insurance rate given my coverage/history/situation? Should I just live without a car?",finance,1431972037
personalfinance,Good idea or a terrible idea?,"I have been struggling with debt since I graduated from a for-profit school about a year ago. As you can guess, my private student loans are ridiculously high and couldn't afford the monthly payment out of school. I was working retail and was unable to pay them for a few months and then finally was able to get a job where I make a decent amount of money.

My federal loans are currently on income-based repayment and I making minimum payments every month. I also have been able to make payments to my four different private loan companies as well as a couple credit cards. Every paycheck I am stretching to make the minimum for all of my bills.

My dad is the best and wants to help me out once he retires in two years by paying off my private loans. He would then leave me to pay back the federal loans as my responsibility. I just need to buy him a vacation every year as pay back.

My question is, should I continue paying the minimum on my private loans well they aren't going anywhere because the overall principle is so high? Or stop paying them and wait until I have a lump sum to offer them.

My credit is already screwed up so I'm not really worried about that, I am more worried about them suing me before two years when my dad can help me out. I would take the rest of the money that I'm saving each month and put it towards my federal loans.

My options expire in January, and with SWKS breaking new 52-week highs and a trailing PE of around 30, I don't see that I could gain much more by riding this option play out until expiration, but I do stand to lose a lot in a market pullback (whether its a crash or not, doesn't matter).

I have watched my credit score go from a wonderful 680'ish to a terrible 560 just because of these high balances. I've cut the credit cards up, I no longer use any of them. I've been making just above minimum payments on them all, but the APR's are killing me.

personalfinance,(x-post from/realestate) Options for Assuming Mortgage from Parents,"Hi there-

I did some searching and was unable to find any posts related to my question. Here goes nothing. I'm going to try to bullet point the main facts to make it as clear as possible.

* The home that my parents live in is worth around 350k. They are in their late 50s/early 60s.
* There is a ~44k left on the mortgage. Property taxes are around $8800 total annually.
* My Mom had major health issues 6 months ago (she almost lost her life), and my Dad has been with her ever since. He's lost his job and they have very little income (only from the one small apartment on the property that they rent out).
* They have been unable to pay the mortgage/property taxes/utilities and my sister and I have been stepping in to help
* If they don't pay the property taxes or mortgage, they will lose the house. The plan is that I will eventually live there one day, and they would like to give me the house if I pay for the remaining mortgage and annual property taxes.

I plan to go to an real estate planning attorney in Pennsylvania, but wanted to get the main gist of what to expect. I have very good credit, and I'd be interest in refinancing (they have an obscene interest on the mortgage), and get a bit more for basic upgrades (i.e. replacing 30 year old windows and adding A/C in the house).

Options that I researched:
1) Selling the home outright for less than market value - what would the lowest price that they could do that at?

2) ""Gifting"" the home

3) Life Estate Ownership

4) Revocable Living Trust


In a nutshell, I'm trying to figure out the best way to use my good credit to allow my parents to stay in the home for as long as they wish (this house was in our family for generations), reduce the interest rate (they are currently around ~11-15% because of their bad credit, and also because the loan was taken out in the late 80s at the worst time) and allow me to gain some tax advantages while I'm footing the bill for the mortgage and property taxes (I do not own any property).

personalfinance,Gift Taxes - Parent transferred over limit to son's account for which they are an account holder,"EDIT: Answered by the lovely gents/ladies below; thank you sirs/madams *tips fedor'01k*

Short recap, my father recently passed away and my mother received some money from life insurance etc. She wanted my brother and I to receive some of the money and just did a straight up transfer into our accounts from her personal checking. Problem is, she transferred a few thousand over the annual exclusion limit of 14k to my brother so that he can get a new (used, but nice) car (drug addict stole his and totaled it during one of the snow storms, but hes still driving it after getting it in working/safe condition). I didn't know she was doing it or I would have told her to hold on while we figured it out as I was aware of the gift tax, or told her to simply purchase a car and gift the title.

She is an account holder for my brother's account (USAA Checking) and thus can take move money into/out of it freely, but I'm not sure if that matters. If she just takes ~4k back out, I don't think it matters what the net activity was between the accounts, just that it was over 14k from one direction. My questions are:

1. Does the gift tax definitely apply to her in this case?
2. Is there anyway to ""undo"" a gift (transfer was this morning and instant)?
3. Should I have her look into filling out some kind of forms that would help exclude these gifts as some part of my father's passing (e.g. inheritance)?

Also, I asked her to call the bank regarding this, they simply said she needs to speak to an accountant/tax specialist. By that I assumed they meant /r/personalfinance of course.",finance,1431985952

Googles mortgage calculator estimates that with an interest rate of 4% over 30 years the monthly payments would be $780. Which I think is doable, especially if we get roommates. Once we finish school and have actual incomes  we would try to pay off the house as soon as possible and rent it out when we move.",finance,1431991668

personalfinance,I always find awesome sounding jobs and then horrible things happen. Any advice on how to fix my life/finances would be appreciated.,"I'm a 25 year old male. No kids. Live with girlfriend in her awesome and nice parents house. I worked at a car auction job for two years (after two years of no one hiring me). The job was fun, easy, and I met some amazing people who are my friends now. But it was part time and paid 8.50 to start and in two years went up to 9.00/hr. 

I needed a new car because the 93 mercury cougar wasnt cutting it anymore with no a/c and no working windows and a blown strut. So I got myself a 03 eclipse. Awesome car but I paid way too much for it. About 11,000. the cougar was a traded in down payment to get this eclipse. I needed a car asap and the cougar wouldn't make it home from the dealership, which I didn't tell the dealers lol. So I ""talked them down"" from 15k to 11k, which in hindsight is way too high still. Anyways I love the car and drive it everywhere. So after I got the car, I begin to notice my payments of 170.49 every two weeks was severely cutting into my checks I made at the auction. I just put up with no money every day and didn't really care so much because I finally found a job I'm good at and enjoy. 

So then, of course, my girlfriend starts nagging me because I have no money due to car and car insurance payments which were high at the time (state farm). Side note... state farm was supposed to give me full coverage when I got the car, and I've been paying full coverage prices. Only until I switched to nationwide for 80 bucks cheaper a month did nationwide tell me I never had full. Thanks state farm, you're the best. Anyways...

So my girlfriends complaining. So as I work at the auction, I'm looking for better paying full time jobs. I end up finding one that's part time (39 hours a week max) but pays weekly and was supposed to pay about 350 a week. So I applied and suprisingly got a call a day or two afterwards and got the job.

It's for a company called CJD or HBH depending on what they feel like calling themselves. I was supposed to drive the company truck (ford f250) to various places and deliver construction supplies to people building or fixing houses. Sounds easy enough and I looked forward to it. My first week and a half all I did was travel to one place daily and shovel shingles and put them into a dumpster. Correction... I picked shingles up with my hand until the last day when someone brought a shovel. The job absolutely sucked but I was told by one of my four bosses that it wasn't typical to be doing that and I should be making deliveries. Did I mention this place never even let me give a two week notice to the auction?

So I then begin making deliveries... I'd get a list of items to get at home depot, which has no experienced workers imo. The list is always wrong and the items were usually wrong. I'd take the items an hour+ away to Philadelphia area and when the worker sees something is wrong I'd have to go to the nearby home depot there and return the item and try to find the right one. 

So this goes on for a month I'd say, just getting worse and worse. Then on a Thursday, two weeks ago, I pick up a large enclosed trailer for a job. Someone replaced the ball hitch on my truck the day before and I didn't realize it. Luckily the trailer didn't pop off on the highway and it did it on a local scarcely used street near the CJD office. So that was the first breaking point. The second and third ones were me getting sent to a house an hour away to shovel more shingles the roofers threw everywhere and for bother days I was supposed to stay there all day from 7am to late at night. I got fed up and applied for a new job just last week.

This job is a contracting job. I use my own eclipse and deliver auto parts to garages. Easy enough. I filled out a ton of forms on and offline, got a replacement social security card, got my driving report which costs me 23 dollars for two pieces of paper saying no violations. Heads up for anyone in PA trying to get one... do it online and if you can't, go to a notary place because the DMV doesn't print them out in person. Anyways, I'm all set and happy to have quit CJD (with no notice because fuck them). So I start this job today (Monday). All went well. I met the other contracted driver, Brian, who just got his first mitsubishi after his ford died on him. Instant friend lol. So I worked all day from 8:30 till 5pm. My boss got along with me and he was happy and talked to me like I was his favorite driver ever. Great day. I get home and am all happy and tell my girlfriend and her parents about the awesome day I had. Then right before dinner I get a call from the contracting guy who got me this job. He tells me the manager doesn't want me back because he thought I was too slow. Mind you, I got all of the deliveries done efficiently and as fast as possible. I didn't take any breaks at all. Just constant running of my car. So now I'm out of a job. 

Here's my issues besides what I said.... I have no job. I have about 7k left in car payments. I have a cell phone bill and car insurance bill coming up. Nationwide told me if I do deliveries with my car that I need to pay commercial insurance with triples my payments. I told the lady, Candy, that I can't afford the first down payment until my first paycheck from this job. I was supposed to make 550 a week btw. So now I can't afford the first down payment and I don't know if I should call her and say I got fucked out of a job or just not say anything since I'm still on my original insurance. I have zero dollars, now a half tank of gas, no job, and the contracting guy said he's gonna call other places to get me in but he doesn't know how long that would take or if I'll be hired. So Should I just get rid of my car (but then have no way to get to any jobs), get rid of my cell phone (and then can't get job calls), and ditch car insurance? I have no way of paying these things and I'm freaking out. Hope my story was a fun read.",finance,1431992553
financialindependence,Pension catchup contributions - should I put my whole paycheck towards it?,"I've been having a hard time coming up with the best course of action here.

I'm in a pension program where I can start collecting at age 50 with 10 years of service and I put 6% of my check into it.  I'm also allowed to buy 4 years of military time, so long as I make payments to handle my portion of the contribution.

I just got the packet and I'm going to need to put in around $42k.  If I put the money in pretax via payroll deduction (which is my plan) then once I agree to a plan, it cannot be changed.  It can be spread into as many payments as you like, but the interest rate on making payments is 7.5%.  I'd greatly prefer that the contributions be spread over 15 months at most - I'd like to have the option to walk away from my job once I've met the minimum requirements.  The contributions must start sometime in June.

I've also got $27,500 left in 457/401k contributions and $11,000 in IRA contributions that I want to max on the year.

My wife isn't pregnant yet, but that's coming sometime soon and we plan to have a baby next year if all goes well, along with some maternity/paternity leave that will reduce income.

Details:  
$5,400 my check after tax  
$4,000 her check after tax  
$5,000 monthly expense  
$2,000 401k contributions  
$10,000 emergency fund (currently invested)  

I'm not really sure how to set my contribution in a way that minimizes risk.  

Set it to take the whole check - gets done in about 5 months, we should be able to live off my wife's check without issue.   Impossible to max the 401k/457 for 2015, but IRA could probably happen by April.

Set it to 15 months - now I'm paying interest at 7.5% and I don't know if it's less risky.  At least on the 5 month plan, it's going to be over quickly before my wife gets pregnant.

Set it longer than 15 months - it would be a long time to be paying that sort of interest.

Anyone have a decent plan of attack for this?  I'm having a hard time seeing the appropriate course of action.  I'd prefer maxing the 457/401k's this year and being done with payments by the time my wife is due with a kid.",finance,1431994372

Here are my relevant details.  Personal goal to buy a home in the next year. Emergency fund in place, Roth maxed out, 401k contributing to maximum employer match, contributing twice-monthly to HSA at a rate that will max me out, including employer contribution. Currently have $10.7k in federal student loans at 6.8%, to which I have been paying off $1-2k per month, depending on fluctuating income. Currently have cash reserve of 4.6k for home buying. Probably looking for a house between 150k-250k. Committed relationship but unmarried, no dependents. Income ~120k/yr.

Due to my aggressive loan repayment, I have pushed my next ""due date"" several years into the future. My loan repayment strategy has limited my ability to put away cash for home buying (currently renting). 

If I were to start taking what I had been paying on my loans for, let's say, the next year, my loan balance would accumulate ~$730 in interest during that period but I would definitely be able to save up enough for down payment, closing costs, etc. for the cost of less than what I am currently paying toward my loans.

personalfinance,"Graduated a year ago, been working, been paying loans off, next step/long term questions","I read a bunch of the sidebar and did some searching, I got a bunch of questions answered but also a lot of questions were raised. Would love to get a dialogue going and really understand what exactly I have going on right now and what my options are.

Some facts to get started:

* My salary is 65k/year
* I have ~5k in my savings account available as emergency
* I have 10k left in a 7% student loan
* 7.5k left in a 3.5% student loan
* 28.5k left in a 3% student loan
* I have been applying 5% of my pay to the ""Roth 401K"" provided by my employer (what the match), diversified it, and am earning ~5.5% atm

My plan has been to kill my 7% loan as fast as possible. Whatever the difference between my paychecks and bills is I have been applying to that loan. After that was done, I was going to look into what investment options were available to me. After some budget planning today,  I realized I could comfortably payoff that loan by November and needed to start making the future plan. As listed above, my Roth 401k has been making about 5.5% so I figured it would be better to pay off my expensive loan first.

Questions:

* Would you be paying off that loan right now or just making minimums and investing elsewhere?
* When I start investing, should I be putting everything I can afford into the Roth 401k investment fund or a Roth IRA?
* To get reach the 2015 max for my Roth 401k, I'd need to put ~25% of my pay into it, is that what you would suggest if I can budget it?
* Just to make sure, I do want to be post-tax right? Because I'm in the lowest tax bracket I will probably ever be. I am given both options
* What exactly is a Roth IRA and should I be getting one and maxing the 5500 before anything else? This would be with an investment management company like Vanguard right?
* Why do I keep seeing the suggestion to buy a used car with cash? I don't own a car yet but everything I hear from my friends is that you can get really low interest loans for a car, like 2.5%. If this is true, wouldn't that cash you are putting into a car be better spent put into an investment of some form?
* Finally, less important, just curious, I called my student loan provider, it's federal, a month ago and they had mentioned that my student loans do not compound. They wouldn't charge interest on my interest. This blew my mind. I just assumed it would compound. Is this normal? When I make payments, the interest I have accrued is paid off first and then the principle is paid down and ultimately on that new principle interest is accrued.

personalfinance,"[Housing] Want to buy an apartment in San Francisco next February, what should I be doing","After spending all my savings on a startup that didn't work out.  I've now moved to San Francisco and gotten a stable job.  In San Francisco rent is very expensive, I'm currently paying $3400 a month for a larger studio, in a nice building that's not in the best part of the city.  My lease ends next February at that point I'd like to be in a position where I could buy a small apartment ideally in the city.

My base salary is $145k, so if I stop contributing to my non-matching 401k for the year I believe I can have about 20-30k available for a down payment.  Worth noting I currently have very little in my retirement savings.  In addition to that my parents have offered to loan me 40k (possibly slightly more) for the down payment with the expectation I pay that back including the interest it would make them in a savings account.  I can't get a straight answer on how the rules for loaning that amount of money would work legally, the best I can find is that it would have to have interest rates of a standard loan, but real estate people seem to believe it can be paid as a ""gift"".

I do not currently have any debts and have good credit.

stocks,Wanna get started trading? Here's how.,"**A summary of the market of stocks can thou givest me?**

Google ""NFLX"" (the ticker symbol for Netflix, the on-demand movie-streaming service corporation). You will see it around the mid-$500s in a 1-day chart. Click ""max"" on the right side of the time-frame tabs. Move your mouse cursor to the pits of hell when it was around $60/share in 2012. Click, hold, and drag to its current price now, on the right. The % you see is the amount of money you'd gain off of however much you threw into it at that time.

* $1 x 800% = $8. Or...  
* $10 would've become $80,  
* $100 would've become $800,  
* $1,000 would've become $8,000,  
* $10,000 would've $80,000,  
* and so on, had you bought that corresponding amount of NFLX shares in 2011 and sat on it, picking your nose until today. (Not counting dividends as applicable.) Make money accordingly!

**Then one share canst be profitable, no? I need not much money to invest!**

Sure, at large prices like this (and including such a long wait, which is easily agonizing for 99% of non-Warren Buffett human beings). But if you want to trade a sub-$500 stock, then you're not going to get very far with one share, because your financial foes will kill you. So normal traders will *probably* need around $10,000+ to start (or at least $5,000+), if you want to do anything more than dabble and earn and lose mere pennies. You want to be able to do trades costing a rough minimum of $1,500 at a time.

**Those knaves! Who art thy devious financial foes?**

Four foes constantly poke at you:

* Your own broker (who will usually charge you a broker-specific commission fee of $5-10 for *EVERY buy and sell transaction*, whether you win or lose);  
* The SEC (at least one to a few pennies are scraped off of every single sale you make);  
* The Bid-Ask spread (market makers always set whatever-the-current-sell-price-is to at least 1¢ lower than whatever-the-current-buy-price-is); and, of course,  
* Uncle Sam (annual capital gains taxes)  

Tip: you can deduct from your taxes, or offset gains, by losing! Just as you can count capital *gains*, you can also count infinite capital *losses* (~~up~~ down to no ~~more~~ less than -$3,000/year, but losses roll over into future years. Ask your wickedly awesome CPA for more info).

**Lies there any way around these devious charges?**

One famous brokerage that's making other greedy stock brokers sweat bullets is the commission-free, currently-iOS-exclusive [Robinhood](http://www.robinhood.com). It will supposedly come to Android and also add a website platform sometime this year. ^Google ^Ventures ^is ^financially ^supporting ^it ^so ^I ^believe ^it ^is ^taking ^so ^long ^because ^Google ^may ^be ^trying ^to ^integrate ^Robinhood ^into ^Google ^Finance.

However, acc. to /r/robinhood (just what I've read of it, since I'm no Apple fanboy and have never used the broker), it has a *few* downsides:

* Listed financial data can be wildly inaccurate (even as basic as what today's High or Low was for a given stock, or its fundamental metrics)  
* Robinhood has [only a few order types](http://i.imgur.com/4D9h6Ah.jpg); it lacks trailing stops (an advanced order type that automatically, passively captures potentially better prices for you) and automated orders (like OCO—Order-Cancels-Order—or other self-automating triggers)  
* No shorting nor margin capabilities are available (without margin, brokers must lock up your money for 3 days after sales, on certain conditions)  
* Robinhood lacks after hours and pre-market trading  
* Some stocks are not available to trade (you may not be able to find your rapturous millionaire penny stock in the platform for whatever reason. Blast!)  
* Sometimes you cannot sell shares of your own holdings (this was supposedly fixed but another user reported this less than two weeks ago in /r/robinhood. The ""sell"" button literally disappeared at times and they couldn't sell their shares.)

**Just atrocious. I seek more powerful armament and shall deal death blows to thy enemies accordingly. How canst I trade more powerfully?**

Find a broker who can grant you a platform to execute trades (none of these will be crippled by any of Robinhood's current problems listed above). Try making a fake paper account with any of these brokerages and just start off virtually. My broker is [OptionsHouse](https://www.optionshouse.com/), which has an initially confusing layout but very possibly [the lowest commission fees](https://www.optionshouse.com/rates/compare/) out of all conventional US brokers. Others use:

* TD Ameritrade (which comes with a very powerful proprietary ""Thinkorswim"" stock analysis platform),  
* Scottrade,  
* E*Trade,  
* TradeKing,  
* SureTrader,  
* Interactive Brokers (non-US),  
* Questrade (epic for Canadians),  
* Motif Investing, and more.

On top of commissions (a flat fee per buy and sell, or a smaller, dynamic fee that changes based on how many shares you order), some of these brokers may charge you a monthly data fee*(for the real-time quote-streaming that they provide you), unless you meet a minimum activity quota each month. OptionsHouse has no monthly fees and will only charge you for filled orders.

Google all of these. Research their fees and capabilities and pick a good one. And let me know if you want to join OptionsHouse; don't sign up there yet because I have a referral link and can show you how to navigate the *entire* platform, as well as provide all the basics to trading on-the-go. I'll also send you my personal stock picks and analysis of ones you want to fire off to me.

**How shall I defeat thy foes?**

It's up to you. You can:

* Day-trade (*not recommended for beginners*): buy a share of [VALE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=VALE) at $8.00, sell at $8.10, rinse, lather, repeat. This is one of multiple approaches called scalping and, when it comes to the raw numbers, it is as simple as that. Of course, once you actually try it, you see that timing is endlessly devious and even the world's very best day-traders basically have a 55% success rate. (*Edit:* Just FYI, this is a horrible % rate! Don't start with this approach.) You will need $25,000 to day-trade due to federal regulations. If you don't have that much, you can still carefully manage your unsettled funds and make approximately 3 or 4 potentially profitable day trades per week, IMO.

* Swing-trade: hold for days to months. Day-trading and swinging classify as short-term capital gains.

* Invest: Don't sell until a minimum of 366 days later after buying. Such investments are long-term capital gains (you get taxed at a lower rate, as opposed to short-term gains).

There are other methods but these are by far the most common.

Key Statistics ≈ Fundamental Analysis (how sound/secure/safe a company is)  
Interactive Chart ≈ Technical Analysis (how good its current position in its chart is)

* Fundamental analysis: helps you pick a good company. Is it in debt? (Hint: nearly all companies have debt.) How is it managing it and why? How is its earnings per share, price-to-earnings ratio, P/E growth, book value per share? What did its last financial statements look like? What do analysts like [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com) think of the stock?

* Technical analysis: helps you locate a good time to enter a company. Does the chart look like it's in a wedge that's just waiting to break out or collapse? Is it in a severe downtrend? Is it on an uptrend or flat-lining? What price ranges look like a resistance (price ceiling) or support (price floor) for it in the short-term, intermediate-term, or long-term? What recent news might cause it to fly or plummet? Decide if you like momentum-trading, bottom-feeding, value-investing, or any other mix of strategies.

Aside from my car loan, I've never been in any sort of debt and am completely clueless about how to handle it.  Honestly, my after grad salary isn't going to be too high (though higher than the 40k I make now), but I'm passionate about the field and can't see myself doing anything else in the long term.  Because of that, I will be looking into PAYE or PSLF when it comes time to pay back my loans.    

I know student loans come with a high interest rate and that I should try my best to avoid taking out more than I need.  I also know that these loans accrue interest while I'm in school.  So what's the best way to balance spending the money I have now, with taking out loans?  Should I take out loans for the amount of tuition and pay living expenses out of pocket?  Should I pay the first year of tuition out of pocket and then only use loans for the tuition and living expenses I can't cover down the line?  Ideally I'd like to retain some savings as an emergency fund, as well as keep 15k around to eventually pay off my car (I assume since that loan is lower interest than my future student loans I shouldn't pay it off right away?).

personalfinance,Questions about federal student loans...,"So some background: I attended college a few years back before personal reasons caused me to take a break. In that time I have been paying off some student loans that I qualified for through FAFSA now I am ready to return to school and had some questions that I THINK I am right about, but I'm not sure.

1. When I return to school will I still be required to make payments for my previous loans?

2. While I'm in school are those loans still collecting interest? 

3. Assuming the federal loans are interest free while I'm in school would it be a wise idea to get more loans from FAFSA (my school is already completely paid for so I don't need the money) and just put them in saving to collect interest and hopefully improve my credit (I am very good at not touching money and would just pay it off completely once I am done with school)",finance,1432015007
personalfinance,Will paying my credit card in full every month not increase my credit score as much?,"I'm not sure if this is a rumor or not, but I always hear it's better to let a company charge interest rather than pay it off in full. Is this true?

personalfinance,Company is being acquired -- what to do with 401k,"So I realize the obvious answer is to move my 401k into my IRA.

But I have a significant amount of student loans.  14k of which is at a 6.8% interest rate.  I have 10k in my Roth 401k at the moment and in 2 months will be able to cash it out since I'll be moving to a new company.  

I have the extra cash to fully pay off this loan and close out the account with the extra cash.  Am I looking at this right?

Paying off my loan would be a guaranteed 6.8% return over the next 8 years (time left using minimum payments) with zero risk.  Better than the stock market at the moment.  

It would also save me 200 dollars a month in minimum payments.

I would pay off the loans and then continue putting 5% (100% match) into my 401k and max out my IRA this year.

Does this make sense, or should I leave retirement accounts alone entirely?

personalfinance,Thank you PF! Got a car loan today!,"This is long, sorry, I NEED to tell someone who understands how huge this is for me!

So for the last couple of decades my financial behaviors and patterns have been abysmal as well as my credit.  I pretty much figured I would never have any ability at financial independence or security because of bad choices, a divorce and unemployment.

I am 40 years old, I should not feel like a rookie any more. 2 years ago I started halfheartedly trying to change that.

Well, thanks to suggestions and info I have gleaned from PF, I was able to get a car loan today, at a decent interest rate so I could replace the vehicle I had that had become an unsafe money pit.
no more dangerous car for me because I couldn't afford to keep repairing it.

1. I started with pulling my credit. I had a lot of bad debts from prior to my divorce and student loans that were delinquent and some of my ex's debts also.  *FICO was 515*

2. Disputed a bunch of the debts (duplicates, over 8 years old, not mine etc.) and got 55k in bad debt reduced to 15k.

3. Then, I sought out and acquired a credit card, for the first time in 10 years. $200 limit. 

4. I then followed the advice given here on how to use it to improve my credit. Using the card for small regular purchases (gas, and clothing and shoes I needed for work.) and paid it off every month or every other at worst. limit bumped to $500.

5. Found a new apartment after being nearly homeless. had the 1.5 x rent size security deposit from savings. 

6. Got a ""cash back"" credit card. $2k limit. Stopped using original one, parked it for emergencies (used it for car repairs). *FICO at 585*

7. Had a discussion with family about value of car loan vs. car repairs when car was unable to drive over 50 any more without losing bits of itself every time and gas mileage had halved. safety, vs. cost etc.

8. Set goals and expectations for interest rates, trade in, cost, what kind of car, where we would need to adjust the family budget to make it work.

9. Talked to my credit union before anything else. got pre-approval for loan for twice what I was comfortable with spending (based on what the monthly payments would be).*Fico is now 631!*

10. Used the power of the internet to look for cars online before I walked into a showroom to get ideas of price ranges and availability.

11. Waited until I was well rested, fed and comfortable to go test drive cars.

12. found car, asked dealer to run numbers to see what loan terms they could get. Not bad, but went with my CU deal instead!

I bought a car! I had a down payment, had good enough credit, and feel like I got a decent deal on the vehicle type I WANTED instead of settling for whatever I could get.

I don't follow ALL of the advice here, and I don't even follow all of it the exact same way it is suggested here. I have credit card debt I am paying off slowly (more than minimum payments less than in full), and I am ok with that.  I know how to not feel overwhelmed by financial decisions any more also because of advice given here. As well as my credit report is not the big dark thing I feared for so many years.

My next steps are to work on paying off 10k in student loans. increasing my income, and eventually buying a home so that I can be shelter secure once my kids are on their own.
Baby steps, but it IS happening!

I will still follow PF, I will still make financial errors but I will not get drowned by them any more. and having a place to go to find answers to ""stupid"" questions without judgement and with a variety of experiences and expertise has been a large part of my success.

**TLDR:  PF gave me enough info for many things that I have been able to make considerable steps forward towards my financial stability. And I GOT A NEW (to me) CAR!**",finance,1432034653

I'm thinking of selling stock I've held for ~3+ years, so I believe the proceeds from this transaction will be taxed at 15% at the federal level, plus some percent at the state level.

Details:

* I live in CA
* Annual salary: 80k base, 10k bonus paid out quarterly (translates into ~$1500 after tax every quarter or so, generally the month after the close of the quarter. Got my Q1 bonus in April, Q2 bonus should arrive in August, Q3 in mid November, Q4 in mid January? etc.)

The company I am leaving had a better deal - 3% match with no vesting, so I was contributing 3% and putting the rest away for other priorities such as an emergency fund (6 months, right?) and saving for a home - looking to have about 15% in a couple of years.

personalfinance,"2 credit cards, one high interest. Balance Transfer advice.","I lurk in this sub a lot, but I'd finally like some advice.  I'm pretty sure I know what to do with my situation, but I would like some feedback.

I accumulated some CC debt the last year of my schooling because I was one semester away and couldn't take out any more federal loans, so I used 2 cards to help pay for a small portion of the cost and my books.  My job wasn't terrific and I was only making minimum payments until now.  I finally got a decent job and I want to pay these things off in the best way possible.

So, I have $2,837 in CC debt.  It's not much compared to a lot of people with credit problems, but I want it gone before Christmas this year.  The breakdown of the 2 cards is as follows:

* $1,705.27 - Chase Amazon (22.24% APR)
* $1,131.30 - Chase Disney (12.24% APR)

Obviously I want to get rid of the Amazon card balance as quickly as possible because of the APR.  My question is if I should find a 0% interest card, pay the balance transfer fee, and pay it off with the same plan but cutting out the few months of the 22% that is going to be gouging away at me. 

I could get a Chase Freedom card and pay a 3% balance transfer and have 0% interest for 15 months. Which would give me more than enough time to pay it off in my goal period or a month after if something comes up.  Would this be the best course? Or is there a better card option with less or no transfer fee %? Or am I going about this completely wrong and missing the point?

Also, I set up a goal on my Mint account and I can realistically put a maximum of $500 a month towards this debt.

personalfinance,My wife passed away May 4th. How do I make the best use of the life insurance?,"My wife passed away on May 4th. She was 33, I am 35. We had a 50k life insurance policy through my employer than I expect to receive sometime in the next 1-2 months. We were in a poor financial situation when she passed, and I would like to make sure that I am using the money effectively so I don't get into this sort of situation again. I have a plan, but very little experience, so I'd like to know whether my plan is the right one under the circumstances. 

Debts: We had about 4k in unsecured credit. I owe 17k (8%) on our car. I have student loans which recently defaulted totaling about 19k (4.25% I believe. Whatever the federal subsidized loan rate is). We also had not filed federal taxes since 2010, and I estimate we owe roughly 15-20k (this includes expected penalties and interest) in back taxes from 2011-14. I have a meeting scheduled with an accountant tomorrow to get the tax returns filed and get an exact picture of what I owe. The only other debt we have is some unpaid medical bills that have gone to collections, mostly under her name.

Income: I earn $5,100 a month. Our 2 children will receive SSA survivors benefits for 2k a month. 

My plan is to use the life insurance to pay off the federal tax debt, unsecured credit card debt, and then vehicle debt, in that order. I will request rehabilitation on my student loans. Any funds left I intend to stick into savings. Is there anything wrong with this? Is there anything I'm missing?

Other questions/concerns:
1) As far as medical bills for my wife, am I liable for those? They are from several years ago, but still from when we were married. 2) Is there any truth to those commercials advertising programs to reduce tax debt if you owe more than 10k? I hear them on the radio and they sound like scams, but is there any merit to them? Is that worth pursuing? 
3) I am going to be taking our children and moving in with my parents in about a month. I will be staying with them for at least the summer so my mother can watch the kids while I work. When I am ready to get a place of our own again, I will be looking close to where they live since my mom has volunteered to continue to watch the kids. This means a longer commute to work (about an hour), but will be better than paying out the nose for child care. Rents in their area are about $1800-$2300 for 2-3 bedroom apartments and homes. Is this affordable for me? It's $1900 a month where we're staying now, but we were slowly drowning financially here and I don't want to do that again. On the other hand, I will be moving in to the new place without the car payment or other debt payments, which amounted to about $900/mo total.  I know there is a general rule that rent should be less than 30% of income, but I don't know if that is built around gross or take-home. I pay into a pension and pay health insurance through my employer, so my take-home usually ends up being about $3,600/mo. This may go down a couple hundred if I need to adjust my tax withholdings to ensure I don't owe again. 

So please, let me know if my plan is sound, or if you have any advice that would help me refine it. Since I have to start over at 35, I want to make sure I do it right.",finance,1432074249

I'm going to use round numbers for simplicity here. Let's say I have a 30 year fixed mortgage paying $2000 per month right now. If I go to the proposed $1000 every other week payment they are saying I'll have paid off the mortgage in ~22 years (again, round numbers) and saved ~$30,000 in interest. When the woman explained it to me she said something about the extra two payments per year (because I'd be making 26 payments) going to the principal and thus paying everything off faster.

They have a bunch of information for what to do when you can't afford your loans but nothing for what happens when you're able to pay them off quickly. 

**My situation:**

I'm dropping out of school to take an extremely well-paying job in the tech industry. I'm $20,000 in debt, in a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans. I make about $3,000 per month more than my cost of living (yes, after taxes, and not counting bonuses). This means that I'll be able to set aside a satisfactory emergency fund and then pay my loans off in under a year. 

I find it unpleasant to be in debt, so my natural inclination is to just pay off the loans as fast as I can afford them (after setting aside an emergency fund, maxing out my 401(k), etc.). 

My specific question is: **How will paying off my loans before they're due affect my credit score?** 

In searching for an answer I also came across [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/qusby/how_aggressive_is_too_aggressive_in_paying_off/), but it didn't discuss the impact that early repayment would have on one's credit. 

Additionally, I'm curious whether the potential harm done by paying things off too quickly would be counteracted by making day-to-day purchases on a credit card then paying it off in full at the end of each month.

Thank you, and I apologize in advance if this was hiding in the FAQ but I searched the wrong thing!

personalfinance,Paying for classes to prepare for graduate school.,"I'm taking classes at a local university in order to prepare a good application for graduate school. Over the next year I'll need to pay about $16,000 for the courses I need in order to have the appropriate background before applying. At the moment I earn about $1,116 a month (with minimal living expenses thanks to a very generous GF and family).

Here's the tentative schedule of the payments I'll need to make: $3,366 by late August, but I should have enough money saved by the end of the summer to pay most if not all of this. $5,049 for three classes in winter quarter (January - mid March), then $5,049 or $6,732 depending on if I take a certain course due sometime in April. I may elect to take an independent study course or two in the summer after that, which tentatively would be another $3,366 but I can think about this later.

The two options I seem to have so far:

1. I still have about $33,000 in student loans from undergrad, and so far I've stayed on top of those payments. I don't know if already having loans will impact my ability to borrow more, and I'm also pretty sure I will need a cosigner. My dad may or may not cosign for me. If I can make it work this would be the best option.

2. My university accepts credit card payments for tuition. I understand interest rates tend to be pretty high, and with payments of thousands of dollars within several months of each other the additional fees would get out of hand very quickly. This would be a last-resort option.

business,"Stronger European growth, US weakness, more hawkish MPC","Analysts believe that the upward revisions to Euro Area consensus growth forecasts have now largely run their course (taking 2016 GDP consensus to 1.8%). Likewise, the correction in 10-year Bund yields from 7bp to 72bp flushed out excessive longs and should now be over. The ECB will increase the pace of QE in the next few weeks, and the narrowing in the Treasury/Bund and Gilt/Bund yield spreads should now pause.
 
US growth should pick up in the months ahead from the winter softness. The pace of the recovery continues to be tepid, but employment and real income growth are strong enough to suggest that a 2 ½ % or so real growth rater will be maintained, and that remains inconsistent with current monetary policy settings. 
Socite Generale expects a September lift-off for Fed Funds and so little is now priced into the Fed Funds futures curve (1% Fed Funds at the end of 2016) that even a single rate hike would cause a re-pricing supporting the dollar.

The Sterling money market prices rates at 1% at the end of next year too. So any upside economic or inflation surprises could trigger a re-pricing and a flattening in the yield curve. But with a Budget announced for July 8 and CPI falling in the year to April, the first UK hike still seems to be more likely to come in 2016 than 2105, lagging the Fed by a clear margin.

My credit report calls them student loans but they are also categorized under ""Installments"" on those credit reports. 

Also, the ""status"" of the loan it asks for is either ACTIVE or CLOSED. What exactly does closed mean? Not sure which one to pick. Maybe closed means I'm not having to pay it off right now?

I also have a Capital One card with a $2000 limit, a $700 balance and a very high interest rate. For about the past year, I've been making a little bit over minimum payments each month. Seeing how signifigantly the interest rate has made my balance not really go down, I've decided to crack down, budget, and pay it off.

I haven't used this card in forever, since I have a history of being frivolous with credit and feel like sometimes it's easier to just pretend that it doesn't exist.

I have about $10000 in CC debt and $45000 in student loans. The loans is a mix of federal and private with the majority being the first. My new job offers several benefits towards investing such as 401k and I was also thinking about opening an Roth IRA. But my question is should I first payoff my debt and then begin to start saving/investing? Or should I begin the investing while paying off the debt? Someone mentioned that this may depend on the interest rate on both the debt and the investment. Meaning if the investment is of a higher interest rate than the CC or loan interest than it's viable. I want to learn if there is a smart way of accomplishing both. If there is any extra information you need to give a better idea just let me know. Thanks Reddit!",finance,1432123195

I called CU Student Loans yesterday since they're generally pretty well regarded in the research I did prior, and they told me over the phone their variable rates go from 3% to 8% based on credit score.

I have a credit score of 768 and they approved me at 7.78%, so I politely informed them that I wasn't interested in refinancing for them if it's impossible to get a reasonable rate with a good credit score.

The thing is, I WOULD still like the refinance these loans SOMEWHERE, but I don't want to have to put in applications with 10 different places and rack up hard pulls on my credit report until I find a place that'll actually give me a decent rate compared to what they advertise.

**If what they're going to offer doesn't line up with what they advertise over the phone, what can I do to make sure that the next place I put in an application with is going to offer me a decent rate?**

I feel like my credit score is well good enough to get a lower rate than 7.78% and I make WAY more than I need to in order to pay the loans off ($46K/yr). I'm just refinancing to get the interest rates lower for the next couple years until these are all paid off.

Anybody have any insight on what's going on here? Anybody have a lead on a place that isn't going to tell me 3%-8% based on credit score and then offer me 7.78% with a great credit score?

Bitcoin,"Radio Host goes Anti-BTC, help me set this straight.","So the following negative article was written by a radio host that is obviously of a different mindset regarding Bitcoin.  I would like to ask my fellow bitcoin enthusiasts to rebut and set this straight. I'd like to address this to Mr Dietrich. I am requesting your assistance in forming a logical and comprehensive reply to the points addressed here:

BITCOIN PROVES THE LIBERTARIAN IDEAL OF PARADISE IS HELL-ON-EARTH
DOP (Direct Open Post)
From MISTER SHON CLEMONS 
To &gt; DOUGLAS DUANE DIETRICH:
""Douglas, I was curious as to your thoughts on Bit Coins and the surge to make all drugs across the board legal and the advent of darknet BlackMarket sites such as The Silkroad and Agora? I reference silk road because that is the one most are aware of due to the media.
""There are many such sites on the DarkNet as I am sure you are aware of.
""Such sites are no different than a gun or even knowledge. It can be used with honorable or dishonorable intent.""

Per DOUGLAS DIETRICH:
Not So By Way of Bitcoinage, Mister Clemons. As a Supervillain-of-Necessity myself, I can Assure Thee BITCOIN IS FOR CRIMINALS.
Libertarians love Bitcoin (a Warning Signal if ever there was one [Libertarians Advocate Elimination of Child Labour Laws]).

About 44% of the online cryptocurrency's users self-identify as Libertarians (id est, Clinical Psychopaths).
They love the fact that it's not controlled by a government or central bank — so no online Fed can ""print"" more of it and inflate our way out of trouble. They love that it's decentralized; it's the currency of The People, not The Man. They love that it's ""mined,"" a bit like gold, because that makes it a bit like the gold standard, which libertarians think real currencies ought to be tied to. They love that Bitcoin isn't taxed, so you can hide your income from the government if you want to. They love the way its value reflects pure supply and demand, and not a value forced into the system by regulation or monopoly. And they love that it's fairly lawless — it's difficult to enforce rules (other than the rules of the market) when everyone in the market is anonymous.

So the Bitcoin experience gives us a glimpse of Libertarian paradise: What life would be like with as little government interference as possible, in a market free of burdensome laws and taxes.
Unfortunately, that experience proves itself a total nightmare. It's characterized by radical instability, chaos, the rise of a boss-class of criminals who assassinate people they don't like, and a mass handover of wealth to a minority even smaller than the 1% that currently lauds it in the United States.

If Bitcoin were a state — Libertarialand ? — it would be like Somalia (a State-In-Failure).
Consider: Bitcoin is most exploitable to Sociopaths.

Currently, for ordinary people, cash and credit work just fine. While some mainstream businesses do take Bitcoin, there is no compelling reason — yet — for ordinary people to use it. If you're a criminal, however, there are very compelling reasons to use it: you can transfer vast sums of cash completely anonymously. Cash transfers are a real problem for criminals. When you can't use bank accounts, lugging around vast sums of cash gets old pretty quickly. Bitcoin solves that. So Bitcoin is very, very empowering for criminals.
The Bitcoin ""Economy"" manifests as a crime wave.

Given that Bitcoin is good for criminals, it should not be surprising that those criminals are targeting other Bitcoin users for thefts. The most spectacular theft so far is the Sheep Marketplace robbery, in which one hacker appears to have emptied a massive Bitcoin marketplace of up to U$D220 million in Bitcoins. Note that Sheep Marketplace was basically a trading post for drug dealers. Bitcoin exchange and account thefts are very common. Herewith a historical scan of recent moral atrocities as committed in currency of Bitcoinaige.

Bitcoin-backed Libertarian ""law"" is enforced by paid assassins.

The most shocking aspect about the indictment of the Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht was not the amount of money in Bitcoin he controlled (U$D28 million, approximated). Rather, it was the fact that when other drug dealers ripped him off, he didn't put it down as the price of doing business. Instead, he is accused of hiring a hitman to murder six people he believed had stolen from him. Ulbricht was a Libertarian. In other words, there will be laws in the Bitcoin Libertarian paradise: And the people with the most Bitcoins will decide what that law is, when it should be applied, and how ""justice"" will be meted out. In Libertarialand, the sentence for nonviolent financial crimes evidently includes the death penalty.

There is literally a Bitcoin market for assassinations.

There have always been people engaging in murder for hire, using old-fashioned cash. But the operator of this Bitcoin website seems to believe that Bitcoin creates enough anonymity to allow assassination to take place ""at scale (to borrow the parlance of the tech startup world)."" He wants to destroy ""all governments, everywhere.""
Bitcoin as a currency is horribly unstable.

This chart (e[lectronically]-ttached) tells you all you need to know. One day you're rich, when Bitcoin approaches U$D1200; the next day half your wealth is wiped out as it plummets to U$D700. Bitcoin isn't backed by any government's bonds or central bank gold. It's literally an asset without an underlying asset. So its price is determined entirely by its flows.

Libertarialand makes the Weimar Republic look sedate. Even if you could live with the crime, the instability makes transactions wildly unfair to the party on the downside.
Bitcoin has produced farcical wealth inequality.

Libertarians don't care about inequality, of course. They see it as a reflection of individuals' natural talents, and as an incentive to work harder. But even the most hardcore free marketeer ought to blanche at the incredible level of inequality already endemic to Bitcoin. Just 47 individuals own nearly one-third of all Bitcoins. About 927 people control half the entire currency. There are just over 1 million Bitcoin holders — the vast majority of them own mere crumbs.

Bitcoin hoarding will inevitably produce a cartel that controls all Bitcoin.
A study from Cornell has concluded that if Bitcoin miners co-öperate, they could end up controlling most Bitcoins and thus control the currency's price. The cartel could beggar or enrich all Bitcoin holders overnight, depending on how they trade it.

That kind of thing just doesn't happen with the dollar.

Even if you can live with the crime, the inequality and the cartel, you might not tolerate the accidental chaos.
When you have a normal bank account with cash in it, you're almost guaranteed not to lose the money. The bank can burn to the ground, be robbed or even go out of business and because of federal deposit insurance you'll always get your money back. You can't ""lose"" US dollars if they're parked in a checking account.

Not so with Bitcoin. If you're ever unlucky or careless with your Bitcoin wallet, you're just completely f__ked:
This guy lost about U$D600 because he reset his mobile phone — permanently deleting his Bitcoin wallet.
This guy threw away an old hard drive — and now he's looking for U$D6.5 million in a landfill.
This guy lost about U$D90 000 because he hit ""delete"" at the wrong time.
Sure, the entire Bitcoin economy isn't run by criminals YET — but it WILL be. There is a price to pay for the freedom and anonymity that Bitcoin provides, and that price is a lack of enforceable laws that benefits only the most ruthless.

The Bitcoin dream of Libertarianism is a literally criminal idea, and you don't ever want to live there ....",cryptocurrency,1432135400
personalfinance,"~ $140,000 (+ 17,000 interest) in student loan debt with ~ $70,000 income","Hey guys,

I've seen some useful posts on here about attacking student loan debt, and I have gotten some information from the Wiki. I was hoping to get advice on my particular plan of attack. I mainly would like advice on lowering my payments initially, and what to do about my private loans. Thanks in advance.  

**loan Summary**

Federal Subsidized: $21,500 (@ 3%-4.5%)

Fed Un-subsidized: $11,500 ($7500 @ 3.86%, 4,000 @ 6.8%) + ~ $2,000 interest

Parent Plus Loans: $40,750 (@ 7.9%) + ~ $11,000 interest

Private Loans: $65,800 ($32,000 @ 3.25% Variable, 33,800 @ 5% Variable) + ~ $4,000 interest  


**Consolidation and repayment periods**

   1. Split the Federal Loans into two groups for consolidation (I am still waiting for this to be approved, has anyone consolidated into multiple groups?). Group 1 will be the 4,000 at 6.8%. Group 2 will be all others. I am applying for extended (25 years) repayment plans for both.
   2. The parent Plus loans I could extend the payment period, but since I will pay them off first I probably will not bother.
   3. The private Loans I don't think I have an option. It's either a 10 or 12 year repayment period (Somehow Sallie Mae doesn't have this info available). This is really killing me right now since they have lower interest and I would like to extend the payments so that I can tackle the high rates. Although paying off the variable interest loans may be a good idea. Advice here would be appreciated.  

**Repayment Plan**

   1. For the first ~ 10 years I plan to make the minimum payments on everything except the Plus loans so that they can be fully paid off in 10 years. I would like to pay them faster, but the private loans will require a substantial chunk of my repayment since they cannot be extended. This will require over $18,000 a year which at $70,000 a year will be tough living in a somewhat expensive city. Any advice on how to reduce payments at first are welcome.
   2. For the next 4 months I will take care of the rest of the private loans and tackle the higher government loans. (rate of $18,000/year, so 6,000 for the period).
   3. The last year I will finish off the rest, which will be about $18,000 of the low interest Federal loans.  


As you can see I am trying to tackle the high interest rates first, but am really struggling since paying them back any faster than 10 years really isn't possible with the payment plan I am forced into with the private loans. Also, the fact that the private loans are variable adds a complication. Finally, even with the plan I have come up with I will struggle to make the payments for several years until I get a substantial raise.  

Any advice would be appreciated.

personalfinance,When to consolidate federal student loans and apply for Pay As You Earn?,"Brief Overview: 

*I just graduated college.

*I have accepted a teaching position in which I do not begin until September. 

*I won't receive my first paycheck until mid-September. 

*I intend to consolidate my federal student loans and enroll in the Pay As You Earn repayment plan.

*I'm currently unemployed and looking for summer work. 

* **My question is two-fold: 1) When do I consolidate my student loans? 2) What do I list as my income?** 

Other Info:

The application for Pay As You Earn prompts me to link to the IRS website for my income, which will determine my monthly payment. Since I was in school all of 2014 (and tutored students last summer), my latest income tax return lists my income at about $3k. The form then asks, ""Is your **current** income significantly different than the income reflected above?"" Since my employment does not begin until mid-September (and thus I won't receive any income until then), I am inclined to select ""NO."" Based on an income of about $3k, my monthly payment will be $0 for the next 12 months. Should I, instead, list my teaching salary as my income? Obviously, I want the lowest payment, but I also do not want to lie to the federal government. What do I do?",finance,1432137523

Let's say I have a $10,000 unsubsidized student loan at 12% interest (monthly rate of ~1%) and am in school long enough for it to grow to $20,000, and now need to start paying.  So half of it is principal and half interest.  The interest continues to accrue on the full $20,000 does it not?  So why does it matter what they say my regular and additional payments go towards.  If i pay $1,000, it drops the total from $20,000 to $19,000.  So the monthly interest that accrues would change from $200 to $190, regardless of whether i tell them to apply it to principal or interest.  Or am i completely wrong and the 12% interest rate only applies to the initial principal, $10,000?",finance,1432142234
personalfinance,Best way to deal with finances when I want to buy a $10k-$15k used car with no credit history?,"Hi there! So I am 20 and work full time with a commute of 44 miles round trip everyday. I am currently borrowing my grandfather’s car due to the fact that I bought a car for $1,500 and the engine exploded on me the third day after I bought it. So...my fiance and I have decided to just go with buying a more new car that will be more reliable. The bigger price you pay, the more reliable….right? Haha.
But anyway, I have a limited time of borrowing my grump’s old car and he is getting very antsy about getting it back so I really need to find a car fast. I barely have enough to pay for a down payment. I have about $500 in savings to for it, unless I can get money off of my dead car, then it can be a bit higher. 

So I want to buy a recently made, used car. But the problem that I feel like I am going to run into is that I have no credit history. I’ve avoided signing up for credit cards because I frankly don’t trust myself with them. The only loans that I am paying off right now are student loans and I hear that they don’t really do anything to your credit score. 

Is there any way that I can buy a car without the interest rate being extremely high or will I just have to expect it and I have no room to work with? I was thinking that maybe I could just go for a car loan that has a super high interest rate and I’ll get a credit card and build up my history over the months and then somehow refinance the car to get a better deal? 

Is there any other way that I can do it? I don’t know anyone that could really co-sign for me, so if I can avoid that option, then that would be great. 

Any suggestions will help. Thanks!",finance,1432144703

personalfinance,Dad wants to add me to the title of the house,"Hi PF! 

A bit of background: I (22 F) recently graduated from university and am working from home as a Software Engineer ($50k base). My parents are divorced but living in the same city so I ""live"" at my mom's house but work from my dad's. Originally my dad said I wouldn't have to pay for rent, but once I moved in he suggested I pay for utilities. We agreed on $100 a month. This is totally fine by me, but now he has been passive aggressively suggesting that I help him pay off the house. I have politely declined each time because I don't have the spare money ($6k emergency fund). I feel like I should help because i make more than he does and eventually the house will be mine (for cultural reasons, he always reminds me that it is ""my"" house). Plus, I'd like to give back to both of my parents for raising me, supporting me etc. 

He doesn't know how much money I have but he must think I am rich because originally he asked for $20k as a loan which he would pay me back with interest. His reasoning being that he would rather give me the interest rather than the bank. Of course, I don't have that kind of money.

Anyway, today he asked if I wanted to be added to the title of the house. I am thinking this is a way for him to get me to make payments on the house, but is there any financial incentive for me to do it? My credit score is 777 according to CK.

I do not have any additional details on the mortgage or interest rate. He has told me that he recently used some money from his retirement plan to pay off around $10k (the taxes he paid ended up being less than the interest he would have paid). He mentioned that after he made that payment, his interest rate went up. I'm not sure if this is common, but he thinks it is the bank trying to make more money off of him before he finishes paying the house. Oh yeah, I asked him how long he thinks it'll take for him to finish paying it off and he estimated 5 years. I really think he is getting antsy and just wants to get the house paid off asap.

Should I add myself to the title? 

I appreciate any and all advice, thanks for reading!

**Edit since my living situation is not clear:

Basically I have two rooms. One at my mom's house and the other at my dad's. I work from the room at my dad's place, but I sleep in the room at mom's. They can both technically charge me for rent and utilities since both rooms are used solely by me. 

From 8-5 I stay with my dad, the rest of the time I am with my mom. I do this to maximize the amount of time I can spend with them (my mom works regular shifts and my dad works night shifts so I can see him while I work )",finance,1432146044

personalfinance,Should I wait for loan forgiveness or focus on paying off all my loans?,"I saw a similar thread posted today, and realized I have a similar question, but with different circumstances. I just graduated with a teaching degree and will begin as a teacher in the fall. I start work in August, but won't get paid until September. My loans will be in their grace period until around November. I will have a yearly salary of just over $41,000. Because of my teaching degree and job field, I will be eligible loan forgiveness after teaching for 5 years in a low income school. All the schools in my area (including the one I will work at next year) qualify as being low-income. My question is, should I focus on paying off all my loans quickly, or pay minimums until I qualify for loan forgiveness? My current plan is to pay off my unsubsadized loan right away, and I have been paying off the monthly interest on it to keep it at the original amount when it enters repayment.

**Loan Breakdown**

*Total Student Loan Debt: $12,871.14*

As for what *kind* of loans I have, they all just say ""direct loan"" from the US Department of Education. 

*Subsidized Loans*

Three loans at 3.4% interest totaling $5824.49

Four loans at 3.89% interest totaling $5014.29

Two loans at 4.66% interest totaling $1018.00

*Unsubsidized Loan*

One loan at 3.86% totaling $1014.36 

**Information on Loan Forgiveness**

There is a [state level program](https://www.iowacollegeaid.gov/content/iowa-teacher-loan-forgiveness-program) and a [federal level program](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation#teacher-loan). For the state, it sounds like they would annually award me 20% of my total eligible federal student loan balance, including principal and interest, but it can't exceed tuition costs at the regent universities (last year tuition at regent universities was around $7,000). It says I can get this for up to five years.

For the federal, it sounds like I may be able to have as much as $17,500 of my subsidized or unsubsidized loans forgiven. This is obviously more than I have in outstanding loans.

I am a 25 year old teacher, and have about $90,000 in student loans. I am finishing up my Master's degree right now while teaching. I plan on enrolling in the 'pay as you earn' program', and applying for loan forgiveness after 10 years (120) of consistent payments on my loans working in a non-profit as a teacher. I am going to start making payments after my deferment period in Fall 2016 with an income of about ~$42,000. 

I already know that I will be stuck paying off these loans over the course of the next 10 years, so I am considering taking out another $10,000 in unsubsidized federal student loans and investing them into my mutual fund. If I did this, it *should* grow over the next 30 years at a 6% compounding interest rate. The reason I am considering this is because I already know that my loans will be forgiven after 10 years - Why not take more out and put it towards my retirement? With a compounding interest rate of 6%, I could turn my ~$10,000 in loans into an extra ~$55,000 at retirement. It's tempting because the 45,000 would make up for the amount I do end up paying over the ten years of repayment, and I would love to be retired at 60 thinking about how I didn't let the system screw me over. 

The way I look at it is that the loan is really just creating cash flow for me to use my personal earnings in my mutual fund... Is this legal? What do you think? Is this as viable of an option as it is in my head?",finance,1432167585

personalfinance,3 Tricks Car Salesmen Use to take your money,"How to Overcome 3 Tricks Car Salesmen Use to Take your Money.  

 
Purchasing a vehicle from a dealership can be an anxiety inducing experience.  What I discovered was that the number one emotion women felt when considering buying a vehicle was ANXIETY followed by uncertainty.  In this article we will review 3 tricks that dealers and car salesman use that cause this anxiety and uncertainty.  I will teach you how to overcome these feelings, and become immune to the tricks. 

 The worst thing that can happen to us as consumers is purchasing something and quickly regretting it.  This is called buyer’s remorse and it is a terrible feeling.  Why? Well you just spent $20,000 and you are married to a monthly payment for 3-6 years. I do not want this happen to you!  The following tips are designed to prevent you from being pushed around by the salesman and to ease your mind of worries in regards to overpaying.
 
#1 ~ Emotional Manipulation

During my car salesman days, we were taught many subliminal tactics to get customers interested in vehicles.  One is emotional manipulation.  The reason salesmen often insist on test driving is to get you to create a sense of ownership in your mind.  “Ma’am take a seat, adjust the mirrors, now adjust the seat until you are comfortable .  Go ahead and turn on your favorite radio station and flip back the sunroof.”  Is your heart beating faster and you excitement increasing?  You are unknowingly getting excited and your mind is taking mental ownership of this nice new vehicle.  That awesome new car smell isn’t helping either is it?  That feeling of euphoria is a very human response.  They are counting on you to feel this way. 

What happens next is quite primitive.  As our excitement builds, the emotional part of our brains begins to take over. When this happens, we are much more likely to make a choice based on emotions.  Have you ever heard of dogs that go crazy and get scared during lightning and thunder storms?  I had an adorable shizu dog that would run miles away when thunder rumbled the house. RIP Bootsy.  During these storms the logical part of his brain would turn off and the emotional part would take over.  In this case fear dictated my dog’s behaviors.  Much like my old boy Bootsy (my mom named him btw), this happens to us when we take mental ownership of a new car.  The budget we set and the price we wanted are now more likely to be negotiable.      

**How to overcome trick #1 “Emotional Manipulation”**

Be mindful of your emotions.  Simply being aware of this tactic beforehand and how our mind/bodies will respond is a half of the battle in not making a poor emotional based decision.  I always recommend that we sleep on it.  My rule of thumb is to never make a large purchase the same day.  This isn’t the same as picking up a Snickers while in the checkout line. This is a 5 figure purchase that we will be married to for the next 3-6  years. Be smart, go home, sleep, and revisit it the next day when your mind has had a chance to tend to other matters.   
 
#2 ~ Pushing you towards Payments

After the test drive we will be directed to go inside, sit down, fill out our contact information, and discuss the price.  Car salesmen are taught to negotiate the payment with us instead of the price of the vehicle.  This has two benefits for them.  1) Making an affordable payment is relatable and gets your mind off of the actual price.  We end up paying more this way. (See Ex1 at the end for a math based scenario) 2) The interest rate and the length of the loan can quickly fall into the background with this payment focused presentation.  The payments method works because we are more likely to digest the affordability of a a monthly payments versus the 5 figure sticker price.  Over six years, a $100 dollar increase is not that much, but by doing the math it will add on $6K to the total price - wow, that's mind-blowing!  See below how Customer 1 saved $4,200 by focusing on a $70 lower payment.  This is worth repeating...A $70 monthly difference saved $4,200!!! 




**How to overcome #2 “Pushing you towards payments”**

Tell the salesman up front “I am not interested in going over payments right now, let’s stick to the price of the car out the door.”  You must be proactive here.  A skilled salesman may even give you a rebuttal of “well ma’am, I just want to make sure you get something that is affordable and fits your budget”.  Just smile at your new adversary and politely say “While I appreciate your concern, I have all of that figured out, please just get me the out the door price”.  (Make eye contact and smile for added value and enjoyment). They will get the picture.  You want the individual price of the car and that is what you want to negotiate.  You have now become a formidable opponent.  You have now indirectly saved yourself hundreds if not thousands of dollars by directing the negotiations down this road.  (See Ex1 at the bottom for a math based scenario on why this works)   Also, the out the door price is the price of the car plus all of the fees that the dealer adds on.  Better to know sooner than later what fluff fees the dealers will add.   

#3 ~ The Finance Office

After a price has been agreed upon, we are sent into the finance office.  Here you meet the Finance Manager.  This person finishes your paperwork, gets you financed (or takes your check), and offers you products to protect your new vehicle.  This is where even the toughest buyers lose.  Why? They lose because their guard is down.  When we agree upon a price, we get a handshake and a congratulations.  Usually the sales manager gets in on this as well.   You give out a big sigh of relief.  In my sales days, I will never forget this one customer who was an excellent negotiator. He knew what he was doing and worked us down to a super low profit.  He clearly was prepared and this resulted in the dealership making around $100 on the car (Nice job!). What happened next really opened my eyes.  He ended up paying $4500 on the warranty and GAP products as well as accepting an interest rate 2% higher than he should have. (explanation of these products below in Example 3)  All of the money he had just spent his energy and time saving was washed away in the finance office.  Customers let their guard down when a price has been reached with the salesman.  Don’t let this happen to you.  Being aware of yourself and the situation is half the battle.
  
I want you to know the background of the Finance Managers and how they get that job.  It’s not by going to business school and majoring in Finance.  They get there because at some point they were the top car salesman in the dealership selling 20+ cars a month.  That is part of the car sales business ladder.  It takes a different set of skills since they are selling an intangible product.  You can’t put your hands on a warranty or an interest rate. Therefore it takes a higher degree of sales skills to be successful here.  They are the best at what they do and that is why they get paid the big bucks. 

The first move when we enter the finance office is to make us feel comfortable.  Let’s nott let his smile and firm handshake fool us.  He has one clear goal.  Convince us to buy what he has.  He doesn’t make as much money otherwise.  He will once again show us the NEW payments if we were to purchase products A, B, or C.  They make money in 2 ways.  The first is by increasing the interest rate we are charged.  They borrow your loan money from Bank A for 3% and charge you 4%.  The dealership gets a part of that and the Finance Manager gets around $500 per % point he charges us.  See Ex 2 to see how a 1% increase can cost you well over $500.   The second way they make money is by selling us the company warranty or gap products which can vary drastically. 
 
**How to overcome #3 “The Finance Office”**

As before, we want to ask for the total price of the product we are interested in.  It really is a personal preference whether you want any of these or not. I personally have and never will get any of them even if they do add free oil changes.  Don’t let my stance deter you though because there are some amazing packages out there that add free oil changes for years.  Be ready to pay a little extra than you would normally though.  The convenience is worth it for some.  (See example 3 below for more information on products and how to get the best deals.)  Next if not already done, we want to clarify what the interest rate is. 
 
Good luck!  I hope that this information will allow you to walk into a dealership with confidence.  I hope this was helpful for you and will aid you in saving hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on your next purchase.

**Example1**

 We are purchasing a $25,000 car.  Let’s say we go in wanting to pay $22,000. 
The salesman comes out and says you can choose from a payment of $460 or $391. “Which one works better for you sir?”  Do you see what he did there?  He changed your $3000 price reduction to a payment and asked you a question directing you to pick from HIS two options.  Many people lose here. They say they like one of the payments and lose OR they say they negotiate and say they want to be at $350 a month.  The salesman takes your $350 request to his sales manager, they come back at $360 (They always come back higher).  Great. Car is sold.  Let’s do the math though.  You wanted to be at $22,000.  By accepting $360 you just paid $23,000 for that vehicle AND you have no idea what the interest rate is.  The lesson here: Keep things simple and stick to the vehicle price first.  When that is settled THEN work on payments. 
 
**Example 2**

A $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 4% ~ You will pay $25,920 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
A $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 3% ~ You will pay $25,200 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
That is a difference of $720
Know your local credit union or banks rates before you finance a vehicle. 
 
**Example 3**

Be familiar with the products BEFORE you go into the finance office.
 
GAP Insurance:  http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/car-gap-insurance-is-it-right-for-you.aspx
Extended Warranty: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/04/extended-warranties-for-cars-are-an-expensive-game/index.htm
 
The $4500 example above was many years ago. Competition in the warranty market has increased and they are much less expensive nowadays.  Still, do your homework and check around. Credit Unions often offer much cheaper products that do more if you finance with them.  Companies like State Farm Insurance now do auto financing and will give you GAP for FREE if you finance through them!  My credit union charges $349 for GAP. Dealerships charge $750 and above.  I hope you can appreciate the value.

personalfinance,Transferring money from my girlfriend's account twice a month for rent and utilities. Are there any issues with how I have this setup?,"I want to make sure there's nothing wrong with how I've currently got our ""rent account"" setup.  I'm a member at a local credit union where I have my personal checking, savings(emergency fund acct) and another checking account I opened that I just call the ""rent account"".  I get paid twice per month on the 15th and 30th and she gets paid every other Friday.  I have transfers scheduled to pull from my checking account on every payday as well as her account.  

The ""rent account"" is strictly in my name.  We have no ""joint"" accounts.  My credit union has the ability for me to ""pull"" money from her account every payday using a ""transfer from another bank or institution"" feature.  From what I understand this is called an ACH transfer.  My girlfriend's account is at a completely different bank, and also exclusively in her name.  There's also a debit card attached to this account with my name on it that we occasionally use for dinners, groceries etc.  At any point there is only about $100 extra dollars in the account.

When I set this up initially, I took the routing and account numbers from one of her checks, fed it into a web form at my credit union and my CU made two small deposits to her account.  I was told to verify these amounts and I gained the ability to ""pull"" money out like mentioned above.

I need to know if there are any issues with this.  Being that these are not joint accounts could I be held liable to pay tax on the money I pull from her account?  Is this the best way to do this?  I really, REALLY want to avoid the exchange of checks/cash between us as we've both become so comfortable with this being completely automated and at this point it would be difficult to adjust.  Would it be better to ask the landlord if we could each send a check(this complicates utilities payments which are all in my name and also paid out from the rent account).",finance,1432184378
personalfinance,Need a complete financial overhaul. Please help.,"I browse this forum quite regularly looking for someone with a situation like mine so i can take advice thats already been given without cluttering up the board as well as blocking those who may need help. After some time though i still don't have quite the path or plan that i need to get me out of my current situation.

So i am aware that other than not knowing how to, i know a large part if not all of my problem is self discipline. For this i have begun to see a therapists. My first appointment is tomorrow, so hopefully that will help as much as i believe it will. Background, i make around 70k a year. My monthly bills total around $1500. I plan on moving out within the year, get engaged, and lastly i need a new car. I get paid on commission and salary, so i get two small checks with one large check at the end of the month. 

* How do i save? I make no less than $4000 a month take home, yet i literally have nothing saved, I live paycheck to paycheck.

* How do i determine how much i should save? I have heard everything from 10% to a certain amount every two weeks. Whenever i save i inevitably end up going back into it. How can i make a savings account that I won't draw from. I put money in but within two weeks I've taken it back out. Right now my backup plan is various electronics that i pawn.

* i have student loans totaling over 50k and i keep deferring payments and not making them. i can't even begin to start paying it because it seems like such a large sum.

* My credit is awful. The last time i checked it was 480, how can i improve my credit score? I have had so many late payments with my last loan, and on the next one i would like to come in with the best possible interest rate.

* I never pay any bill on time. How can i get to the point where not only am I paying bills on time but almost paying them ahead of time so to speak?

* This really should be number one but i just remembered it now. I haven't been able to renew my drivers license because i owe the state around $1700 in fees in order to renew. I need a plan to pay this immediately.

At this point Im about ready to give up but the only reason i won't is because i plan on having a family and want a better life for them. I recently lost my father and we have such similar money habits its not even funny. I remember my dad saying if money is the problem, well make more money. I have lived this way all my life. When i was having issues budgeting i would just look for a job that paid more. I now realize that its now what you make but how you use it and how you save it. He died with nothing saved up and lived by the seat of his pants so to speak, he was a great dad just really terrible with money. I don't want to be the same kind of parent or husband when it comes to money. i have found the woman i want to spend the rest of my life with and i want to be a  great partner for her, and one of the biggest things that can affect a marriage is money. I witnessed this first hand. This is my life story so to speak, Please help and thanks in advance for the help.

Edit: First off thank you everyone for the responses. I took the advice of this place and went to mint to take a look at where my money is going and Im depressed and shocked at the same time. First major problem, is that every month this year i have spent more money than I have made except for one. I am just shocked at the lack of awareness in myself. Second, i have spent $3300 dollars on food this year. The only thing I have spent more on is the house. Im not sure how long this is going to take or how hard its going to be, but this has to change. I appreciate the help so much and any more on how to curb this would be appreciated.

I believe the price for the car was $25,000, but my mothers credit is horrible so the interest rate ended up being 11-12% (according to my mother.) Now I make $469 payments, but $171.50 goes towards financial charges. As of today my unpaid balance is $20,294.35, with a payoff amount of $20,468.64 which increases by $5 a day up till 5/30/15. I'm trying to consider my options whether it means getting rid of the car completely and getting a used car that I can pay for out of pocket or even just getting my payments lowered. I've considered refinancing the car into my name because as of December 2014 I had a credit score of 697, and it should have only gone up since then.

personalfinance,Buying a new/slightly used car...should I finance or just pay cash?,"We need to buy a car to replace a totaled vehicle (we're okay) that we got some money for, so no trade-in. We have an emergency fund that's just the right amount to buy a new or slightly used car but not much more. It's sitting in a savings account getting almost no interest, about 0.75%. Our emergency fund isn't too critical because we have family that would help us if something really unexpected happened. I have a solid job and the only other debt is our mortgage.

I'm wondering if it makes more financial sense to buy the car outright or finance it. We have a mortgage rate of 5.25% on the house with more than I can afford to pay it off, but I've thought about paying some of it off to lower the amount of interest paid to the mortgage company, assuming the interest rate on an auto loan is less than that. We're planning to sell the house next year, so I don't think it matters too much and I'm worried that if the house can't sell, any money we've sunk into it is wasted.

I don't know how much car loan interest usually is, but I have an excellent credit score, around 800. I don't like having debt, but if the car loan interest rate is low enough, does it make more sense to take it or not?",finance,1432221896

personalfinance,Looking to come up with a plan for borrowing and repayment.,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for advice on the best course of action to take with a graduate school loan that I plan to take out. So the total loan amount that I need for the first year is roughly 70k. To come up with that sum of money, I will need to take out two different loans with different interest rates (I think because there is a maximum amount I can take out under one loan). Those options are 6.2% and 7.2% interest. My current plan was to take out the maximum amount on the 6.2% interest loan, let's say 50k. That leaves 20k for the 7.2% interest loan. 

Now comes the hard part for me. I want to know what kind of repayment plan would save me the most amount of money. If things go right for me, I plan on having about $1000 per month to spend on the repayment of this loan. I think I read on this sub that one should always pay back loans in order of decreasing interest rate, but since the amounts are so different, and the interest rates are only 1% different, I thought maybe that did not apply here. I am wondering if it would save more money if I started paying back the larger loan first versus the 7.2% interest loan.

economy,The Fall Guy is in Place for the Next Financial Crisis,"An interesting article by Mr. Kolhatkar describes Shadow Banking as being the new buzzword and intended culprit for the next financial crisis (and there will some kind of upheaval coming, although what will trigger it and what form it will take unclear at the moment).  We have worked in the financial industry for about 17 years before becoming involved in our current business (which we have been running for another 17 years so you can deduce my age based upon that).  And the point to be made is that there are a number of financial activities that are either regulated by different authorities, all depending upon the activity or depending upon the corporate structure involved (banks versus say hedge funds), or in some cases perhaps almost not at all.  And of course in recent years the growth of OTC (over the counter) derivatives trading and swaps have ballooned (both in volume and bubble like proportions).  However, it was a former head of the US Federal Reserve Bank that testified to the US Congress that banks are sophisticated financial institutions that need not be interfered with (our words and not the actual testimony, but you get the picture).  But of course if that is the case, then why have they been bailed out with tax-payer money?  The past 2008 financial crisis involved over zealous and sloppy lending standards by the financial institutions as it related to real estate loans, but the next crisis may very well involve derivatives, swaps or both.  If they knew what they were doing with mortgages and mortgage backed securities, and were bailed out when they had gotten into trouble, what makes anyone think this scenario would not be repeated with a possible derivatives problem?  Unless of course they have no intention of getting any funds from the government run deposit insurance or the tax-payers next time and intend to grab it from some place else. 

Despite the positive intentions of the 2010 US Dodd-Frank legislation (which addresses OTC derivatives trading among other things) we find it very interesting that a November 16, 2014 G-20 meeting resulted in what Mr. Martin Armstrong calls the case of government walking away from its promises (to protect bank account holders).  Mr. John Lawrence, writing an article dated January 6, 2015 titled: The Bail-In: How You and Your Money Will Be Parted During the Next Banking Crisis (San Diego Free Press) says it quite well:

When you deposit money in a checking or savings account, that money no longer belongs to you. Technically and legally, it becomes the property of the bank, and the bank just issues you what amounts to an IOU. As far as the bank is concerned, it’s an unsecured debt.  The way Dodd-Frank has managed to screw things around, derivatives (bets banks have made in the Wall Street casino) have priority over your checking and savings accounts when it comes to paying off their debts. And don’t think that the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) will save your money. The assets of the FDIC are minuscule (in the billions) compared to the valuation of outstanding derivatives (in the trillions). Your deposits are protected only up to the $250,000 insurance limit, and also only to the extent that the FDIC has the money to cover deposit claims or can come up with it.  Ellen Brown asks: What happens when Bank of America or JPMorganChase, which have commingled their massive derivatives casinos with their depositary arms, is propelled into bankruptcy by a major derivatives fiasco?  So, shadow banking, alien invasion or whatever (whomever) that may be called to blame for another financial crisis, it seems the average bank account holder could be at risk.",finance,1432231109
investing,[Help] - Fed Reserve Requirements,"I have spent well over six hours researching this question on my own - asking this question of reddit is my last resort so please bear with me!

I am a university student and am reading an old school book - *Winning* *on* *Wall* *Street* by Martin Zweig. He talks briefly about measuring the Fed's changes in its reserve requirements in his Monetary Model. He was writing in 1986 and explained: ""At this writing, the Fed hasn't touched reserve requirements since the fall of 1981"" (p. 52).

I have looked at the Fed's website that explains their history of changing reserve requirements (list at the bottom) - http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm#na

I definitely see some activity from 1981 to 1986 in their changes (#s 43-70). Are any of these ACTUAL changes to the reserve requirements? Which data point in 1981 is the latest change to the reserve requirements that Zweig was mentioning? I cannot understand why M. Zweig mentioned that the Fed didn't touch reserve requirements since '81 when I can clearly see that there are data points between '81 and '86.

I find this important because although reserve requirements may not be as relevant as they used to be, I would still like to be able to completely follow what the author is explaining.

personalfinance,Is refinancing smart in this situation? Need help making a decision on car loan.,"Hi Guys,
Here is the story

Purchased a 2014 Dodge Challenger last February with an interest rate of 15.22 %.

Here I am a year and some 13-14 odd payments later, i'm researching and looking back and considering refinancing for a lower interest rate through my bank Wells Fargo. 

I currently am paying $537 a month on a 75 month loan, which wasn't initially what was discussed with the sales rep, but the finance department of did some low down stuff. I always pay over by at least 10 to 20 dollars. Would it hurt me to refinance? I absolutely don't want my loan extended, and the payments aren't really hurtful as I have a decent salaried job,over 50k yearly, with no kids. I do have substantial other bills such as Student Loan debt, and rent.  I just feel like why should I pay more in interest if I qualify for something better a year later. If payments can be lowered that is only a plus, but it's not an end all be all. Chrysler Capital does not offer refinancing, so I decided that my bank may be a good option at 3.99% and less for active accounts.Any advice is welcomed before I make the call to Wells Fargo.

I first found out about this on April 18th, and since then, I have been making multiple visits to the IRS trying to find out why my taxes haven't been processed yet, but they have been unable to help me. I paid Federal Taxes this year, and I got my State refund via a debit card about a week after filing taxes. The last visit to the IRS said that the possibility might be because of a discrepancy between the listed Wages earned on my W-2 form, and the wages shown on the return form printed by TurboTax. My W-2 shows $5,992.49 in wages, but TurboTax is always showing a value of $6,769.00 on the review page.

EDIT

So I got home and did some research. **My State Offers a $4,000 tax deduction**.  My state offers three plans. One is mostly invested in CDs, the other is advisor-sold (whatever the hell that means) and the third plan is with Fidelity. 

I don't know how to interpret the fees.

*Program management fees:
0.09% for the Fidelity index fund options (includes 0.02% state fee); 0.20% for the Fidelity fund options (includes 0.02% state fee); 0.35% for the multi-firm fund options (includes 0.05% state fee). For the Bank Deposit Portfolio, fees vary from 0.00% to 0.10% (including 0.05% state fee) based on the Federal Funds Target Rate.*

*Expenses of the underlying investments:

Ranges from 0.10% to 0.20% annualized in the Fidelity index fund portfolios, from 0.36% to 0.83% annualized in the Fidelity funds portfolios, and 0.70% to 1.09% in the multi-firm portfolios. For the Bank Deposit Portfolio, there is no underlying fund expense. There is, however, a Bank Administration Fee, which ranges from 0.00%-0.40% and is based on the Federal Funds Target Rate.

Total asset-based expense ratio:

0.19% - 1.44%*

These figures might as well be Greek. I have no idea what good rates are. It does come with a Fidelity credit card which rebates 2% of purchases....we only have 2 credit cards so that might be something we would eventually consider. ?

personalfinance,Is continuing at my current university worth this much student loan debt?,"I'm entering my sophomore year at a top engineering school, and I currently owe $24k on a private loan and a few thousand on federal loans for my freshman year. I'll need to borrow around $30k in private (or parent PLUS loans) each year for my remaining three years in addition to a few thousand in federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans (total cost of attendance is around $60k and I get $25k in grants).

I understand that this seems like a very bad idea, and attending this school was not a decision I made lightly. The only way I justified this is because the median starting annual salary for graduates from my department is $85-90k for a BS (or around $100k for an MS, which I could complete if I stayed for a fifth year), and it is by far the most prestigious university I was admitted to.

Basically this:   

Baby on the way. Our weekly spending budget is $300. I am in full-panic-mode trying to figure out how we're going to do this.  

More specific:  

As far as our monthly bills, after things like electricity, rent, water, etc, our only luxuries (NON-necessities) are:  
-Netflix ($8)  
-Hulu($8)  
-Cable/internet($105)  
-gym membership($64).   
-cell phone bill ($180)  
...So $365 goes toward stuff we don't ""NEED.""  

We also just got a new car (it's a used car -- but newer than the one we had). Our old car was a death trap, and again, with a baby on-the-way, we needed something safe. 
...$370/month.  

Aside from that, our major problems are credit card payments.
...$240/month.  

Here's what I've tried to do to help cut down on our monthly bills:  

--We're in a 2-year contract with our cell phone provider, and I've looked into switching to T-Mobile, but since we're so new into our contract, we'd end up having to pay $$$ to get out of it, ...which we cant afford right now to get out of.  

--I've looked into cutting our cable contract (we will need internet for business situations at home). So next month when we can afford to pay the ""Early termination fee"" we will be getting rid of cable.  
...So that'll be maybe +$60/month  

--The gym membership is a big question. We really do use the gym membership--4 days a week--so while we don't NEED it, we definitely do benefit from it greatly... I don't know if I could let that go -AND- therapy. Especially after having a baby. (I was spending $320/month on therapy before, and decided to cut that out to save money). And our neighborhood isn't really ""walk outside with a baby after the sun sets"" friendly...if you get what I mean.  

--We don't go out to fast food, or Starbucks. I love cooking and don't mind cooking at home. 
...However, Costco membership is out of the question because our apartment cannot handle 30lbs of (enter food here). There's no room for large pallets of cereal or meat. I don't know how to cut back here unless we eat spaghettios and canned beans 24/7.  

--I've been wondering if I should look into debt consolidation loans for our credit cards? Our total amount of credit card debt is about $14,000. I looked into going through our credit union, but the monthly bill would be $310 for the loan. And while the interest rate is lower than that of our credit cards, it's still more cash we would have to pay every month... which would eat into our weekly spending. So, would that be worth it? Or not?   

This whole thing is massively stressing me out. I just don't know what to do.   

I know that living in Los Angeles is a major part of our problem, because rent is so damn expensive ($1400/1 bedroom apartment--no utilities included). And we plan on moving, when we can... who knows when that will be.

personalfinance,Postgraduate course (UK) - putting myself in too much debt?,"Dear /r/personalfinance,  

I finally muster up to ask for your help after years of lurking. I'd like to know your opinion about my current situation and kindly seek your advice on how to proceed.  

**At present:**  

I have been accepted for a postgraduate degree at Manchester, in [Operational Research and Risk Analysis](http://www.mbs.ac.uk/masters/courses/analytics-operational-research-risk-analysis/). I would really like to go ahead and take the opportunity, but I am unsure whether it is financially a sound decision. I'll first share some relevant information in order for you to understand more about my situation.  

**Background:**  

I am currently a 4th (final) year student at University of Manchester, UK, graduating with an Upper 2.1 (65-69/100) in BSc International Management. I have spent 1 year on exchange at the University of Hong Kong. My strong points are Decision Analysis/Statistics/Data(Financial) Analysis (scoring in the 80s). I am a Romanian citizen, living in the UK since September 2011 (except for 2013-2014 when I was in Hong Kong). I have a high GMAT score (690), with a low numerical (58%), high verbal (91%), high analytical (92%), and quite high integrated reasoning (81%) (the numerical score is a huge disadvantage imo, I know I can do better if I were to take it again, but short on money).  
My previous work experience is close to in-existent: I have interned in a Romanian bank (Payments &amp; Credits) for 3 weeks in 2012, and worked 1 month as a Student Ambassador for my uni this past autumn. I have been involved in societies (AIESEC, Romanian Society), and volunteered as a Peer Mentor for the uni.  

Here's where it gets nasty: my current undergraduate debt is **~12,500 GBP**, with an interest rate of 1.5% p.a. I am only going to start payments when I have a fulltime job earning over 18k GBP per year, and pay the loan at 9% p.a.  
I still have accommodation until the 11th July 2015 paid for. I have **3000 GBP** in savings.  

The postgrad program costs **10,500 GBP**. Accommodation would be another **~6500 GBP** (until July 2016). Since course finishes in December, it will probably add another **3,000**. Food will probably cost me another **3,000**. Transportation **400**. Other stuff (books, photocopying, laundry) will add to another **1000**. This puts me at a total cost of **25,000 GBP**.  

I currently have no job. My parents can probably help out with **300-500** per month at best. That's **~5000** let's say. Combined with my savings, I would still need to somehow make up for the remaining **17,000**.  

**My current ideas are:**  

Get a job for the summer here (as moving back home for the summer would yield peanut money) - that's wishfully **2,000** in profit.  
Find some kind of part-time work during the program. That would realistically give me ~500 a month, **~6000** for the year.  
  
**Summary:**  

As you can see, I'm still in a hole for about 9-10k. There's very little solutions on how to manage this, and it resolves to either my parents taking out a loan with which they'll most likely struggle with, or me trying my best to obtain a [bank loan](https://www.gov.uk/career-development-loans/overview). Either that, or deferring for a year and working full-time (still waiting for a reply if deferring is possible).  

In addition to Manchester, I have also applied for MSc Finance &amp; Investments at University of Copenhagen, and Masters in Management at University of Mannheim (both which are free), and I'm hoping to receive a positive answer. However, in terms of curriculum, I find the one at Manchester more attractive, better suiting for my skills and capabilities, and in a domain in which I highly want to work in.  

Data/risk analysts' salaries vary from 20k with no experience and going up to 100,000k GBP after a few years if you're good and get into the right places. Finding work in something I like and I'm good at at the moment with only an undergrad degree seems difficult.  

**Solutions?**  

Am I being unreasonable here? Am I focusing too much on Manchester and not even considering the other alternatives I have?  
How can I get hold of some extra money to survive the next year if I do end up accepting?  
Would the undergraduate loan + an eventual bank loan put me under immense financial struggle after finishing the degree?  

I kindly appreciate any recommendations and will do my best to provide more info if necessary. Thank you everyone for reading this.  (edited for formatting)

/r/relationships

(throwaway because I'm overly paranoid)

Hi all!

**A little background first... Skip this part if you're not interested or if not relevant...**

I graduated an expensive college (yes I know I was very dumb) a few years ago with about $75k debt. I intentionally neglected paying it off because my plan was to just live in foreign countries my whole life (remember when I said I was dumb?). My plan worked and about 1/3 of it, $25k, quickly defaulted and is now in collections. The seven year clock on that should run out in 2-3 years.

However a couple years ago I moved back to good ol' USA and got my shit together in just about every way. Quit smoking, read the best book ever (*I Will Teach You To Be Rich*) and the best subreddit (you guys), got good checking and savings accounts, started an IRA, even CapitalOne shockingly approved me for a credit card, no annual fee Quicksilver, with a TransUnion score of about 600 (must have been a mistake).

And of course I started paying back the remaining $50k. Half of that is private through Sallie Mae - now Navient, the other half was Federal. I consolidated the Federal at 5.6% fixed and snowballed that down to less than $9k now. I've been snowballing the Federal instead of Navient loans because I've been on their private loan rate reduction plan since my move back to USA. It's currently at 3% and since I've only been paying the minimums the balance is still around $25k. But I'm not going to be able to stay on the rate reduction plan forever. In a few months it's going to shoot back up to 7-11% rates.

**So now... Sorry for all that setup...**

My long-time girlfriend, who as you're about to find out is an amazing person, has very sizable (over $100k) savings from being financially responsible her whole life. She's agreed to give me a $25k check to pay off the remaining private loans all at once, and then I'll pay her back an agreed-upon amount over the next couple years.

I know this is possible because that's when I would have paid off my loans anyway, based on the math I did and tools like ReadyForZero and Tuition.io. My current salary is $50k but I have very low living expenses.

**I guess my questions would be something like...**

* Will the bank teller look at me funny when I walk in with a $25,000 check?
* Will this $25k count as income? Would the IRS even know? If so will I have a huge unexpected tax bill?
* Am I better off just paying Navient over time, since student loan interest payments are tax-deductible, while payments to girlfriends are not?
* Any other thoughts you may have on my situation. Don't be afraid to tell me I'm still being dumb.",finance,1432252162

finance,A couple detailed questions about the Treasury General Account and governmental spending...,"Just had a couple questions about how the government spends:

1.  When the Treasury issues debt is it doing so to cover the Treasury General Account (just to prevent it from overdrafting) or is it tied to the shortfall from the amounts passed in the appropriations bills (i.e. the sum of funds appropriated less current TGA balance less tax and misc. revenues)?

2.  The TGA is a reserve account at the Fed.  When the government pays for services it credits the TGA and debits the recipient's account.  Let's say for simplicity that this payment is going directly to a bank.  The bank's account that's debited is a Fed account as well, correct?  Yet this account is different than the account the bank would have to hold its required bank reserves, yes?  So the bank has two accounts at the Fed - one for these types of transactions and one for its reserve requirement?

3.  If we assume the government pays an individual for services, the TGA account is credited and the money shows up in the individual's depository account at his/her bank.  How does this transaction take place?  Assuming that the bank has a Fed account the money is transferred into from the TGA, how does that money go from the bank's Fed account to the individual's depository account?",finance,1432253386

While these statements can apply to more to just finances, the chances are that you understand that it is a bad idea to invest all your cash in one stock, or put all your money into the same property - but have you really thought about a long term strategy?
Current bank interest rates can only be described as shocking. I read an article at work today that discussed how an Aberdeen Assets fund manager has stated that the safest place for savers to put their money is in shares. While this might seem like an outrageous statement to most, he makes a good point; investing money in a savings account is a pretty bad idea. Given the current rates of inflation versus the interest rates… you are guaranteed to lose money.

What is Forex Trading?
Forex Trading is something we have all probably heard about at some point – perhaps through an advert in the Financial Times or a money magazine of some sort; but do you actually know what it means? Forex trading is the trading of foreign currency (hence the name foreign exchange). Essentially, you buy one currency with another – the idea being using the fluctuating currency conversion rates to your advantage.

Success Story – The Accidental Pay Day
I have a great personal example of how you can make some serious money on the Forex markets. My uncle and his family live in the US after he emigrated over 20 years ago. After leaving the UK, he sold his property and left a large sum of money in a UK bank account. He owns a project management type business and a few years back had to transfer a large sum of money as collateral for an insurance bond – essentially he had to use the nest egg as a guarantee against the insurance policy for a job. He transferred the money from GBP (British Pounds Sterling) to USD (US Dollar) at a rate of approximately $2 for every £1. £80,000 of savings became equivalent to $160,000.
Now he kept this money in the bond to guarantee the insurance for about nine months and transferred the cash back to his UK account shortly after. He thought nothing of this for about a year, until he received his annual interest statement for the UK bank account. Can you imagine the shock (and delight) upon finding out that £80,000 was now over £100,000!? Now I can assure you that the bank didn’t decide to pay him 25% interest, but instead the foreign exchange markets had changed significantly: £1 to $2 had become £1 to $1.50. A case of trading the money at the right time – Had it been the other way around, he would have made a significant loss!
 
Who is Forex Trading For?
The simple answer is everyone! Anyone is able to trade in foreign exchange, but those who have interests and investments in multiple countries had a slight advantage as they can trade between bank accounts. For example, if I have investments in the US (or at least in dollars) and in the UK, I could benefit from having assets in both currencies and move funds when the markets are advantageous to your positions, but there can be significant fees associated with this technique. Others will use Forex trading platforms to convert money between different currencies with the intent purely to make money – i.e. there is no practical reason (like to invest in a property) for converting from one currency to the other.
 
Like anything else, Forex Trading has a level of risk associated with it. There are many resources online where you can learn about the principles of Forex and trading within the market. I highly recommend that you do some reading and research before jumping in – You can lose money as well as gain through trading currencies. That said, if you are totally risk adverse, maybe the low-interest savings accounts are a better option. You have to be prepared to lose some (if not all) of your investment or play. Similar to the stocks and shares, some currencies are more stable than others – politically unstable currencies are far more likely to fluctuate than the US dollar.

I know very little about finances but I know that starting my life with massive debt is never a good thing. Also, I have really shitty credit that I'm trying to fix. My score is 545 if that helps at all. Interest rates on loans might be really high.

To give you a little background: I am a California resident, currently finishing my GE and major prep at community college to save money. According to financial aid calculators, if I'm still classified as a dependent, I will have to pay anywhere from 28,000-34,000 per year at a UC and 22,000-24,000 per year at a CSU. That would include tuition and on campus living. I know in some areas living off campus is cheaper but I would have to investigate that based on where I end up and who I can find as a roommate. I have 26,000 in savings for college but that still leaves me with anywhere from 18,000 to 42,000 in debt if I finish my bachelor's degree in two years. So thats option 1. 

If I hold off on doing my major prep until I'm 22. I can finish it by the time I'm 24 and gain independent status. This would reduce these debts to 0 according to financial aid calculators. (This is the net balance owed - 26,000). This makes me wonder if taking a few years off would be beneficial. I understand that education gaps look bad for college applications which is why I'm considering joining Americorps for a couple years (At the end of each year term you get a 5,000 dollar scholarship).

 The third option, would be to use the 26,000 to go to Europe and obtain my education in Germany for free and use any extra money to travel. With either option I'm really scared about how it will effect my future. Any other suggested options are welcome! I'm only 19 so please any advice from someone who has dealt with this sort of conflict, is financially successful, or is a financial advisor would be much appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1432284651

technology,Dianne Feinstein responds to my letter of concern over US Patriot Act renewal,"Dear Mr. /u/magic7s:
 
Thank you for contacting me to express concern about the USA PATRIOT Act.  I recognize that this is an important issue to you, and I welcome the opportunity to share my point of view.
 
As you may be aware, on May 26, 2011, Congress passed, with strong bi-partisan support, legislation to extend three expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act – known as ""roving wiretaps,"" ""lone wolf,"" and ""business records"" provisions – until June 1, 2015 (Pub. L. 112-14).  It is important to note that all three of these authorities can only be used after being approved by a federal judge.  These provisions do the following:
 
Roving wiretaps – before this authority was established, warrants could only be issued for a specific phone number.  In the modern age of telecommunications, terrorists were able to evade surveillance simply by switching phones, which is easily done with throwaway cell phones.  Thus, the ""roving wiretap"" authority simply authorizes a judge to issue a surveillance order that is specific to the suspect terrorist, rather than specific to a particular phone number. 
 
Lone wolf – the lone wolf provision allows for court-ordered surveillance of foreigners who engage in international terrorism but for whom an association with a specific international terrorist group has not yet been determined. 
 
Business records – finally, Section 215, or the business records section, allows the government to obtain business records relating to a suspected terrorist if it receives a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.  This provision also provides the legal authority for the National Security Agency to receive information about phone calls (the phone numbers and the time and length of the call), pursuant to a court order.
 
In the interest of making sure these provisions can't be abused, on November 18, 2014, I joined 57 of my Senate colleagues in voting to bring the USA FREEDOM Act to the Senate Floor for amendment and debate.  This bill would have reauthorized these provisions in modified form.  Unfortunately, it did not receive enough votes to overcome a filibuster, but I am committed to working with my colleagues in the new Congress to pass similar legislation to extend and reform these provisions, especially Section 215, before they expire in June of this year. 
 
I understand your concerns that these authorities may be misused.  As Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have seen how United States intelligence and law enforcement agencies have used these authorities, and I have come to believe that these programs are legal, properly controlled, and have not been widely abused.  I take seriously my responsibility as Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee and will continue to vigorously pursue oversight over these programs by working to verify that these programs are conducted legally and with the proper safeguards. 
 
Again, thank you for taking the time to write.  Your feedback on this subject is important to me, and I will keep it in mind as the Senate continues further extensions of the programs authorized by the USA PATRIOT Act.  If you have any additional comments or questions, please do not hesitate to contact my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 224-3841.  

Sincerely yours,


  Dianne Feinstein

* 35k in 401k/IRA
* 85k salary
* Renting in Northern Virginia area @ $900/mo
* 10 min commute to work

House:

* 350k comps
* Seller agreed to 320k plus closing costs, sold as-is
* Renovations are estimated at 25k, but aren't required for the home to be livable (unfinished basement, aging HVAC, no washer/dryer)
* I am ready to put down 5% and put some money in immediate renovations.
* PITI, PMI, HOA = $2300
* 60 min commute to work

I understand that in most situations, this wouldn't make sense at all.  However, my cousin is willing to live with me and rent most of the home for $1400 a month, so this will be cash outflow neutral with my current rent.  Cousin is super responsible and stable, he understands that this will be a purely business landlord-tenant relationship, will keep emotions out of any renting-related issues (as will I), and estimates to remain a tenant for at least 5 years.  Another consideration is the low interest rate environment and my area's strong housing market (home value could possibly rise to 400k? Or plummet back down to 150k, a la 2008/2009 recession... who knows).

TL:DR: Should I buy a house that I otherwise shouldn't, given that my cousin will pay most of my mortgage and help me build equity?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses and feedback! To be clear, I could technically afford the full mortgage on my own... It would just be very painful and I'd likely have to tighten my budget. And I know my cousin (or even I) may get hit by the proverbial bus, but I wanted to see if y'all's though that the rewards outweighed the risk.

EDIT 2: There seems to be some confusion as to why I am even considering this move, so I wanted to clear it up.  Reiterating my response to /u/aBoglehead, assuming the happy path, I will be 5 years ahead of the the mortgage curve and will have built equity with no difference in monthly cash outflow, while (hopefully) experiencing some appreciation.  Also, interest rates are super low right now (was able to lock down 3.75%), and housing prices in the area may appreciate (admittedly, speculative). If housing prices increase at the same rate as my savings, what's the point? Might as well lock in a good rate and a good price now.  Feel free to poke holes in this logic.",finance,1432305261

personalfinance,Internet Scam Contacts Victim Through HIJACKED SHERIFF'S PHONE NUMBER!!!,"I rarely do any investigative/expose writing, but in this case I will make an exception!  (This article is NOT a satire!)  A personal friend has recently fallen victim to a heinous Internet scam which induced severe panic attacks, paranoia, and loss of sleep.  An email was sent by someone claiming to be Senior Law Enforcement Officer Michael Black of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  The Email states that a debt is due which has been turned over to the local Sheriff's Department.  If the debt is not settled immediately, ""You will be arrested!""  Shortly after reading this email, you will receive a phone call from your local Sheriff's Department (or some other law enforcement organization).  The phone number will be the REAL phone number for that department!  If you reverse lookup the number, you will find that it actually does belong to your local Sheriff's Department!!
A phone number is provided for settlement of the debt.  In this case the number was (510) 356-6617.  It should be noted that this number is registered to an ""Angel"" (probably a fake name) in Berkeley, CA, whereas the REAL FinCEN department is in Virginia.  Upon calling the phone number, a series of hoops will be presented through which you are expected to jump.  You will not be permitted to hang up the phone, and will be directed to a nearby gas station or grocery store.  In this case it was a Winn Dixie.  Once you arrive, you will be told to load a certain amount of money (the total amount of your settlement) onto a prepaid card... this time it was a PayPower Prepaid Visa.  While still on the phone, you will be asked for the card information, then told NOT TO REGISTER/ACTIVATE the card!  The man on the other end of the phone will tell you that this did not work, and you will be sent to another place (all while remaining on the phone).  The next step in this particular instance was to go to WalMart to send a MoneyGram... not to an account, but to another prepaid card.  To reiterate, you will then be asked to load someone else's prepaid card via MoneyGram.  When this ""doesn't work"" you will then be told to put more money onto yet another prepaid card, in this case a Greendot Visa.
All throughout this process, you will be threatened repeatedly with arrest within half an hour if you hang up the phone, or refuse to comply in any way.  They will use whatever personal information they have managed to get on you in order to lend credence and substance to their threats.  However, be warned that this is a SCAM!  In the case of our friend, the Sheriff's Department, upon being contacted locally, had no knowledge of the phone call that came from their phone number.  These law enforcement numbers are being hijacked to make the scam's threats seem real.  The prepaid card you purchase will be quickly registered to the name of the scammer and promptly emptied, then closed!
It should also be noted that our friend did not answer the initial phone call from the Sheriff's Department.  Later, after the scam, she listened to a voicemail message left by that number, and heard that it was the same voice of the scammer with whom she had spoke for almost two hours!
DO NOT FALL VICTIM TO THIS SCAM!!!  If you already have, know that it is a scam, and immediately report all of the pertinent information to your local, state, and federal cyber crimes divisions!",finance,1432307639

* $14,500 Car payment @ 2.99%  Min: $249/month

If I were in an accident and the car were totaled (assuming no personal injury), I assume insurance would only cut me a check for $11.5k and I would be out the other $3k.  Therefore, in this case is it smarter to pay more on the car first even though it is as a lower interest rate?

My payoff is $9600, and I pay $267 monthly (generally I round the amount up to $300). CarMax has offered me $5500. That leaves me $4100 underwater.

I'm having a bit of trouble wrapping my head around the math. $350/month is about my ceiling where I'm not going to have to considerably adjust my lifestyle, which puts my right at $20,000 total maximum cost.

personalfinance,(GERMANY) Not sure whether to refinance; 32K€ penalty( and total mines of 3000€) in exachange to a fixed lower interest rate for another 10 years.,"Hi there,

I have an issue which I'd like to discuss with you all.

I have the option to refinance my current loan which has fixed interest rate of 4.19% and is fixed until 2020. After that, it will be fixed based on the then interest rate for another 10 years.

Now I am considering to refinance and pay a fine of 32k€ and fix the interest rate at 1,27% for another ten years until 2025. I have computed the costs and it will cost me around 3k€ (32K€ -  lower total  interest rate down payments)  if I choose to refinance in total. The upside is, that I basically have to pay 3000€ for fixing the interest rate at a lower rate for another ten years (2015-2025).

My questions are:

Is it worth the 3k€ to do that? Or should I wait another 5 years with the assumption that interest rate will be comparably low as they are today.

I apologize for my suboptimal financial English, but I hope that I got my point across.

personalfinance,Refinance my mortgage to consolidate debt? (US),"Apologies for the length, TLDR at the end.

My mid-range financial plan includes possibly refinancing my mortgage next year to a fixed 15-year loan. I expect to have eliminated all credit card debt by January so I'll be able to shift my payoff goals to the mortgage and the second mortgage I took out a little less than 10 years ago.

My current mortgage has a 4.25% APR and the second is 3.25%. I've been making interest only payments on the second for many years because of the low interest rate and the fact I have other higher interest debt. I'm told I'll have to start paying on the principal sometime next year although I have not verified that by reading the loan docs. I also don't remember it being mentioned at the time the loan closed but the lender was Countrywide. It's now owned by Bank of America.

According to my lender's (Quicken Loans) website, a 15 year loan refi would have a 3.25% APR. Shortly after I found this information, they began calling me to discuss my options. I had just wanted to find out what they had on the website but I relented and answered one time they called.

They are offering to refinance me for the amount of my mortgage, the second mortgage and enough cash to pay off two substantial credit card debts (9.25% and promo 3.99% until August). I would still have a 30-year fixed mortgage with 4.25% APR. My plan was to pay credit cards off this year using Restricted Stock Units granted to me by my employer. I have two separate grants vesting in August which I had planned to sell immediately and payoff two cards with promo rates (3.99 and 0%) that are expiring then.

If I decide to do this, I'd either choose to hang on to the stock in case the price rises, and/or spend some of the money on a new used car. Or perhaps some home repairs.

TL;DR: Should I jump on 4.25% refi consolidation to accelerate paying down higher interest accounts? If I do, I can hang onto incentive stock grants or use the money for something else.",finance,1432317887

personalfinance,The case against an FDIC insured rainy day/emergency fund,"Hey guys, hear me out before burying me with downvotes! 

tl;dr: allowing several month's worth of expenses to stay in a liquid account like a savings account has a larger opportunity cost than people generally realize. 

$2,000 in a checking account is approximately no liquidity, as it handles only month to month expenses like rent/mortgage etc. I'll take that as the baseline. $20,000 is a few months of living expenses based on $80,000 annual cost of living. People tend to recommend rainy day funds of 2-6 months, so I think this is a reasonable estimate.

If I maintain an approach of keeping a rainy day fund between the ages of 25 and 65, I will assume this means holding $20,000 instead of $2,000 in cash.  This is $18,000 in, let's say, a savings account making 3% interest rate (not bad, about triple the best you can get today!) instead of 7.5% in some ETF. In both cases you keep $2,000 in your checking account. We will assume 3% inflation.

Scenario 1:
$2,000*(1.00-0.03)^40+
$18,000*(1.075-0.03)^40=
$105,290 in 2015 dollars

Scenario 2:
$2,000*(1.00-0.03)^40+
$18,000*(1.03-0.03)^40=
$18,591 in 2015 dollars

That is a pretty remarkable result! This is a difference of almost $90,000 between early career and retirement age! If you take issue with any of the numbers I would be interested to hear, but they seem reasonable to me. And of course the values are easily swapped in the calculations if you care to do it. The only one I don't know if it was reasonable was the 3% rate on FDIC insured, immediately accessible, cash? Seems weird that it would be the same as the long term inflation rate, which is commonly estimated at 3%. 

That means that it costs you $180 per month in today's dollars to guard against black swan events like the stock exchange shutting down. That is an expensive insurance policy, especially given that even in the case of the stock market shutting down, you are likely only guarding against a few days of having your assets unavailable! While it is true that holding cash protects you some from extreme deflation, periods of deflation are extremely rare. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation#Historical_examples), and even if 50% deflation happened overnight, the $18,000 rainy day fund would only save you ~$9,000 vs having it in stocks! 

It is extraordinarily rare for large, emergency expenses to require you to write a check right then and there. Hospital bills, unemployment, car trouble etc can all easily wait 3 business days for your broker to liquidate some assets. Especially true if you have a credit card that doesn't have a bill coming due the next day. In fact, I haven't been able to come up with a single example where the cost of delaying a couple days might approach the cost of leaving your emergency fund in a checking or savings account (of course, if it is in a checking account, this calculation becomes even more insane without that 3% interest benefit). 

Another possible protest is that stocks can lose value quickly, rendering your rainy day fund inadequate. This is of course true, but a reasonable portfolio, even in the Great Depression, did not lose more than half its value. [edit: u/adle1984 pointed out that a recent 25 month period did see more than a 50% drop, at 53%] In fact, you can set your little investment to automatically sell at a certain threshold of loss! (10%? your choice!). It requires _very_ little risk tolerance to handle a rainy-day-sized principle's market fluctuations, especially in light of the tremendous opportunity cost!

personalfinance,Need assistance with paying off Debt / Raising Credit Score,"Greetings, /r/personalfinance.

I've been doing a lot of digging lately and there is so much conflicting information on the web that I'm not sure where to start.  My story is pretty similar to a lot of folks, I was careless with my finances in my 20's and have never had that great of a credit score.

Recently I've been trying to figure out how to improve my score and I'm unsure if I should pay off old debt or leave it on there.  I don't have a lot of debt ($3024 in total) and the majority of that is medical bills.  

I'm looking for assistance in how to go about taking care of these.  Realistically I could pay off all of my debt in about 6 months (3 if I was aggressive about it), but I hear that paying off some old debt can have negative effects, and the majority of the advice says to not touch it.  I want to do the right thing, but I also don't want to throw away money for no reason.

So, here's the breakdown of my current FICO scores and debt / date opened:

**FICO**

*  Experian: 598
*  Transunion: 610
*  Equifax: 623

**My Debt in collections are as follows:**

*  Alliance one (old utility bill, Feb 2010): $220
*  AMO Recovery (old utility bill, Aug 2013) $138
*  ARStrat (Medical bill, Jan 2014): $1412
*  ARStrat (Medical bill, Jan 2014): $615
*  Midland Fund (T-mobile Bill from 2008, but showing opened 2013?):  $523
*  Comcast (2013 bill, but showing opened Feb 2015??): $116

I do have some positive things as well.  I paid off a 3 year car loan in November of 2014 w/ no late payments.  I recently opened a small credit card that I use only to pay insurance and gas and pay off the bulk immediately.  I keep my utilization &gt;20% at all times and leave a small balance on there to do so.  I'm hoping to get a new car around August or September and would like to have a higher rating so I can get a better interest rate.

As for the old debt, should I think about taking out a loan and paying them all off?  Will that help me positively?  I know some of the debt is still relatively recent and now that I'm making decent money, I don't have an issue with taking care of all of it.  Should I start by paying the smaller debt first and working my way up?  

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!  I'm apprehensive to contact a debt consolidator or talk to someone for advice as a lot of them on the web seem like scams, and I want to make sure I go about cleaning this up in the proper way.

As you can see, there are quite a few loans and the ranges of interest rates vary greatly. The problem is that his parents keep talking about how he needs to consolidate his private loans, almost as if that will make the problem go away. As I understand loan consolidation, it seems like it would only be helpful if he was having issues making the monthly payments, which is not the case.

I created a budget with him and we figured that he can pay $1500 a month towards the loans while living comfortably. Using unbury us, I showed him how if he sticks to that plan, he can pay off these loans in 5 years, and will be able to pay off the two highest interest rate loans by November of next year. 

The problem is that there are 15 loans there, and he is afraid that he may miss a payment, and his parents are on his other shoulder telling him about how necessary consolidation is. I am afraid that if he does listen his parents, he may have these loans for much longer than necessary.",finance,1432337480
personalfinance,Is it possible for me to get approved for a student loan without a cosigner?,"I just got my financial aid award letter for this upcoming school year.

personalfinance,Need some guidance on my family's disastrous financial situation and whether bankruptcy is a viable option,"My father worked in the business end of a software company that he founded, and was its largest shareholder. A short while before I went to university, a merger happened and a lot of changes occurred in corporate structure and management. He was essentially thrown under the bus by his partners, the company took a huge nosedive, and eventually went into bankruptcy. He could've backed out of the mess and sold his shares, but he didn't and he lost basically everything (we're talking several million $$$...). Since then, he had been trying to fix the company and has just now started looking for new work, but has not had a steady paycheck for a long time. My mother works and brings in a steady salary at $55,000, but it's nowhere near enough to pay off the debt. Retirement funds have been used up just to stay afloat.  

List of debts that accumulated over the years:

- Loans from family friends ($14,000 and a lot of animosity over repayment)

- CC debt (estimated at around $60,000, though it is being paid under a settlement)

- Mortgage (behind in payments by $20,000 and several hundreds of thousands of dollars left to go)

I haven't gotten a chance to ask about the interest rates on any of these, but I can't imagine they are very good. My father is an educated man, but he fell into some very poor circumstances and made even worse decisions. There's a lot of shoulda-coulda-woulda, and some may be wondering how it could come to this, but all these details were being swept under the rug whenever I asked how things were going. I was not living with them at the time and had no say over what they did. My father has an enormous sense of pride and he probably thought he could have reversed some of the things that went wrong. 

That's all in the past, and I want to know what steps we can take moving forwards. Even though my father is looking for work, I'm afraid that it will be little too late and my sister and I will be forced to dig our parents out of their hole unless they file for bankruptcy. They have some overseas assets that they are trying to liquidate in order to pay off the loans from family friends, but it's taking a while and I don't know exactly how much they would be getting out of that. I have no idea what they are planning for retirement with all this, but my sister and I are going to have to support them in some way or another. We are both very concerned, as we are literally just starting our careers and have our own student debt to manage. Any guidance would be appreciated.",finance,1432340042

personalfinance,Streamline Refinance - Skip 2 payments,"Hi!  Has any one refinanced their mortgage with the same company that you already had for a lower rate?  I am working with my current mortgage company to refinance and lower my interest rate from 5.5 to 3.85%. This is a no cost refi. (they are paying all the closing costs)  They have told me that based on my close date I could skip either one or 2 payments. I have heard of missing one..but not 2. I am a little nervous that it sounds too good to be true, and that come closing time I will end up paying the prepaid interest at closing or that my escrow account will be short.. or that my first payment will be high to cover the missed interest. I have asked all the questions and the answers I get back, are just ""it will be rolled into your loan"".
So I guess what I am asking is if anyone has actually skipped two payments, and if so what was your experience, or is there anything that can come back to bit me.

Some things about me that I think are relevant:

1. Getting someone to cosign is not an option.

2. I have a Capital One 360 MONEY account (a checking account by Capital One for teens) that I want to close down sometime during this summer and replace with a Charles Schwab checking account. The MONEY account is about 15 months old and has had hundreds of dollars of transactions with no overdrafts nor bounced checks (ones that deposit money into my account; this checking account cannot issue checks so I've never written one from this account), ever.

3. Interest rates do not matter as I do not intend to ever spend more than I have in my checking account. Furthermore, I do not care about introductory APRs nor do I care about balance transfer offers (as I don't have any outstanding balances). 

4. Rewards, while nice, are not essential to have because I don't anticipate spending more than $250/month on a credit card. Assuming a 1% rewards rate and a $3,000 annual spend, that's just $30/year in rewards. Which is, in all reality, negligible.

5. I do not want a Discover card.

6. I do not currently have any debt. I do anticipate borrowing some direct federal loans every year for the next four years.

I'm a 36 year old woman, divorced (no kids), and have only student loan debt. I’ve worked hard to get to where I am today - thanks in large part to this sub. Just want to make sure things continue to go in the right direction. I’m also starting a new job in 3 weeks and ready to start a new chapter in my life. So, here goes:

•	Salary = $80k per year, paid bi-weekly. My previous employer paid monthly which made it very easy to budget.

•	In my new job, my net pay bi-weekly is estimated to be: $1536.77. I’m factoring in Federal Withholding, Social Security, Medicare, State and Local Taxes and 403B. Taking 1 allowance. I contribute the maximum amount to retirement (and no matching for 1 year). 

•	Expenses are roughly between $1670-1950 per month (~$700 is for various savings goals - I pay myself first and “treat savings like a bill”)

•	Checking = $500 (leftover usually)

•	Online Savings = $15400 (@ a paltry 0.75% APY)

•	Retirement = $164,231 (sitting in 403B)

•	Traditional IRA = $39,685

•	Roth IRA = $25,242 (Maxed my Roth IRA for the past 2 years)

•	Online Brokerage = $10,892 (stocks) but want to start 3-fund portfolio

•	No credit card debt; no car (rely on mass transit - monthly pass=$128/month)

I would like to buy a house in the next 5-7 years. I am looking in the 210k-225k range depending on a variety of factors (and prices can/do change). I plan on putting 20% down on the house to avoid PMI (having learned my lesson from my first home). My FICO score is ~ 815.

I realize the wiki covers “I have $X, what should I do with it?"" I’m not sure what to due with a recent windfall of $15K. I’m thinking I will use this money to do the following:

- Pay off my last student loan ($1800 @ 3.25% interest)
- Finally start my 3-fund lazy portfolio (I’m an aspiring Boglehead)

If there's interest I'll put another one up next week and if you have any questions hit me up in the comments and I'll try to give you an intelligible answer, or I'll just make one up. Enjoy!

US investors continue to find themselves in a difficult position this week with the current outlook placing them firmly on the horns of dilemma. On one hand, more positive housing data and inflation data at expectations this week is reinforcing the theme of a Q2 resurgence while simultaneously lining up the Fed for 2015 rate hike. Wednesday’s FOMC minutes did little to clear up the confusion with the Fed continuing to wait on more data but essentially taking a June hike off the table due to ‘strong economic headwinds’. 

The S&amp;P thus recorded a meek 3pt gain to close at 2,127 on low volumes and in a relatively tight trading band which says to me that firstly, the desks were already focused on the long weekend and secondly, no one is really sure what to do next. In FX, the better economic backdrop is helping the USD to find its legs as the market increasingly discounts the weaker Q1 data with the EUR/USD cross losing 4c (US dollars now more valuable) in a quick move downwards.

Elsewhere in the world, rates volatility in the Eurozone has subsided (Bill Gross’ now infamous Bund short trade – which he talked but didn’t actually do) as the ECB announced it would front-load QE purchases to support the market. Greece continues to be a concern as the next IMF payment data approaches in early June. Chinese growth is looking increasingly shaky with investment and industrial indicators all down making it more likely the PBoC will ease again in the coming months.",finance,1432387602

Their interest rates are some of the best out there and I have heard nothing but good things on this sub. Am I the only one who had a bad experience?

The last month has been back and forth with them, resending them the same documents over and over as they request them. They tell me ""great, we will process this and you will get a phone call or email in 2 business days"" but I always end up having to contact them after 4-5 days of no response.

They can't accept my ID or my husbands because drivers lisences typically expire 5 years after they are issued and that is not the case with either of us. My drivers lisence is only good for one year because I got a new one when my name changed but didn't have the money to pay for a renewal. My husband got a new one when he turned 21, but still had 3 years left before it needed to be renewed so it's only good for 3 years. Ally basically told me that we both needed new lisences to open an account with them (even though my husbands is good for 2 more years, mine is up in November). Is this normal? Seems rediculious to me.

I finally called (3 days after I was supposed to hear from them regarding the ID issue) and cancelled my application.

personalfinance,[18M] Car loan or pay for the car in cash?,"Hello /r/personalfinance! 

Let me describe the situation here. I am an 18 year old male serving overseas in the United States Navy. I bank with Navy Federal and have ~$1150 in my savings account and usually have about $500 in my checking at all times. Starting next month, I'm going to be promoted from E1 to E2 and start getting some special bonuses due to where I'm stationed. I'll go from getting about 1400 a month to 1800 or even close to 2000 a month. 

I'm highly considering buying a car to allow me some freedom to get around and not have to rely on the bus schedule. I have a friend selling a '92 Ford Ranger for $1600. I test drove it and I know it has a failing master cylinder. He said he would replace the master clyinder before he sells it to me. Now, I know this guy pretty well so I'm confident he's not going to rip me off.

Now I'm debating, should I take a loan for like $1000 from Navy Federal and pay for the other $600 out of my own pocket? The benefits to a loan is that I can build my credit and (to my knowledge) it should be easy to get a $1000 loan when I have good credit. I don't know my credit score but assuming that I pay off my bill every month when I do use my credit card (which is once or twice a month for minor purposes), I would guess I have good credit.

Anyhow, I also have the cash to pay for the car right now. I coudl easily withdraw $1000 and dip into my checking and pay off the truck one time. Or I could give him like $1000 now then pay him like three $125 over the next 1.5 months.

Anyhow, which is a better idea? Taking the loan or just using what cash I have? My mother (who is an accountant) says cash but my father (who is the vice president/production manager of a medium sized company) says loan. I've since come here for a third opinion since now I'm split down the middle.

personalfinance,"My boyfriend, who I would like to build a future with, is about 100K in debt from student loans. He recently told me he is considering filing for bankruptcy and I want to make sure he's making the best financial decision not only for himself, but for us as well.","UPDATE: I misspoke in regards to the university. It has NOT closed, but the majority of it's programs have lost their accreditation. The reason my boyfriend left the university, is that he could see that it was going downhill quickly and got extremely frustrated with his money basically being thrown away. I have often heard him talk about this school as one whose only goal was to make money and fuck the education and the students.

I apologize for the length of this post, I tried to only include the details that I think are pertinent, but that turned out to be quite a lot of details. Throwaway as my boyfriend browses reddit and this contains some quite personal info. I'm posting in personal finance, even though it could be construed as a relationship issue, as I really want to understand to the best of my ability his financial situation, what his options are and how this could affect our financial future. Both my boyfriend and I are in our early 30's and we live in California, if this information is relevant to any answers/advice. SO, THE SITUATION:

&amp;nbsp;


* My boyfriend, when he was in his early 20's, went to a very expensive private university. In order to be able to attend he had to take out student loans to cover the entire expense, which now amounts to around 100K in debt. He didn't end up finishing his degree, although I don't know how close he is to potentially graduating, and since then the school he attended has closed/lost it's accreditation. This makes finishing his degree all the more difficult as he would need to transfer to a different university and he would probably lose a lot of credits. As far as I can tell, he has no interest in going back to school and is pretty ashamed of what he describes as the incredibly financially naive and reckless decisions that he made (his words not mine). So basically he is 100K in debt with nothing to show for it. 


* He is currently defaulted on almost all of his loans, and is only paying one of them back. The one that he is paying back has his mother as a co-signer.  He pays this one so her credit won't be negatively affected. I believe he pays around $380 a month on this loan, although I'm not sure of the exact amount and I don't know what the principle amount of this particular loan is. 


* Because he's not paying back any of his loans, he has extremely bad credit. He told me can't even get a credit card or anything like that. Also, even if he wanted to go back to school, he would never qualify for more student loans, which he could very well need to finish his studies.


* I asked him about loan forgiveness, and if that was an option for him (I don't personally know much about this), but he said that only about $5000 of the $100K is federal loans, the rest are private, and only the federal loans would potentially be eligible for loan forgiveness. I have no idea if this is true or not. 



* He recently told me that he is considering declaring bankruptcy so he can ""wipe the slate clean"". He says he will have bad/no credit for the next 7 years, but then at least by the time he is 40 he will have a chance at a fresh start (this is all his words, not mine, I know almost nothing about how this process works, or if what he says about bankruptcy is true).  Unfortunately he doesn't have the money to declare bankruptcy (he told me it could cost around $6000 - again I don't know much about this).



* One option he is considering to come up with money to declare bankruptcy is cashing out his 401K ahead of time. Obviously he would pay a huge penalty for this, and lose probably more than 1/2 of the money. I believe he has about $11000 in his 401K right now.

&amp;nbsp;



So that's his situation. I was a little overwhelmed when he told me all of this. I really love this guy, and I see a future with him.  Other than his financial problems, he is an amazing boyfriend. He treats me so well, and we get on enormously. We both feel that this could be ""the one"" that makes it to the end. For me, that means marriage, and I'm super concerned about marrying him with this financial mess he's in. I've been lucky in that my parents paid for undergrad and I received scholarships for about half of my Masters degree. The rest I paid for with money I inherited from my grandparents. I have almost no debt, and have never taken out a loan (except for one student loan for grad school that was subsidized and I paid back in entirety before it started to accumulate interest).  I'm actually going back to grad school this year, and it will be the first time I have to take out substantial student loans to really pay for everything. Luckily, I'm going to a public state university so tuition is fairly reasonable. I will also graduate with a degree that will funnel me into a very specific career. I'm not going to be making oodles of money or anything, but I imagine I'll graduate with about 20K in debt and a good job secured or at least a degree that will help me find a good job in the field that I want to work in. For me, I'm not worried about having this amount of debt, and feel like it's a reasonable amount to be able to pay back within 10 years (or maybe less?) or graduating. I currently have good credit (a score of 770).

&amp;nbsp;



So, my questions are:


* What are my boyfriends options financially? Is declaring bankruptcy really a good option? How does this work exactly, and how would it affect his financial future? Are there other reasonable options for paying off this debt? 



* If, or when, we were to get married how would this affect me?  I'm obviously concerned about tying myself financially to someone who has either declared bankruptcy or has 100K in debt, and in both cases, has bad or no credit. Would this affect my credit? If we got married, would I be responsible for debt he accrued before we married? Would it be better to just wait it out, and get married after he has all this sorted out (potentially having to wait 10 years for this to happen)? I'm not thrilled about that prospect, as I do want to get married, and like I said, most likely to this guy.  Luckily neither of us wants to have kids, but I also go by the motto ""never say never"". Meaning, there is a VERY slim chance that I or he could change our minds and decide we want kids. But, if we did decide to have kids, this would put an obvious much larger financial strain on our life.  Basically, would I be a total idiot to tie myself legally to these financial problems, especially when I have a very strong, solid finances and almost no debt?

&amp;nbsp;



Like I said, I have very little experience in dealing with financial problems of this kind as I've been extremely lucky and haven't had these issues arise in my life so far. I don't believe that my boyfriend is financially irresponsible (although typing all this out certainly doesn't look good for him), but that he made some bad decisions early on, and they are having detrimental effects on his financial life. 


&amp;nbsp;



Thank you Reddit for any help/advice/information you can give me regarding this issue. I really want to arm myself with as much knowledge as possible so I can help him to figure out the best way to deal with all this, and of course, to protect myself and make sure that I'm making the best decisions for my future. 


&amp;nbsp;



TL;DR: Boyfriend, who I really want to marry eventually, has 100K in student debt, with no end in sight to be able to pay it off. He is considering declaring bankruptcy to rid himself of these debts.  Currently has basically no credit, and would continue to have this problem whether or no he declares bankruptcy. What would be the best way for him to deal with this debt? Is declaring bankruptcy really a good option? If we did get married how would this affect me and my credit? Would I be responsible for this 100K debt? Would I be a fool to tie myself legally to someone with such deep financial problems?

personalfinance,Withdrawing from IRA or Private Student Loan?,"Hi, everyone! Thanks in advance for considering my post. 

I am attending law school this summer in NY. I currently live in the Bay Area and will be moving to NY in July (school doesn't start until the end of August). As of today, I have no savings and am using the money I do have to bring down my credit card debt as much as possible before I move (~4k). I plan on taking out federal student loans, but these won't be disbursed until the start of the school year, so I'll have a couple of months with no income/no savings. 

I have a 401k with about 16k that I plan to rollover into a traditional IRA after I leave my job. I would like to use that money to pay for an apartment and live off of until my loans kick in. I expect that with the requisite first/last month's rent, security deposit, and likely broker's fee, I will have to hand over at least 6k upfront.

My question is: how much money can I expect to get if I withdraw from the IRA? I would like to take out a minimal amount, but if worse case scenario arises and I need to withdraw everything, how much will I actually receive? 

(My mom makes less than 20k a year and my siblings are just as strapped for money, so a temporary family loan just isn't an option. 

I have considered taking out a private graduate student loan as to not touch the funds I have in the IRA, but that seems like a whole other can of worms.)

personalfinance,"[Taxes] Need help understanding my deductions on my paycheck, and where this will leave me at the end of the year","Hi, I'm sorry if this all sounds really misinformed or ignorant, and would really appreciate any help laid out as blatantly as possible.

I have a part time job as a waitress. I average probably 25 hours a week, but make on average about 150 dollars a day in tips. I've been recording my tips, but up until recently they hadn't been taxed on our paycheck. The IRS contacted the owners of the business, so our tips are taxed.

On my pay stub, I only got 14 hours in last pay period (due to a work-related injury), but I made 285 in tips. For an hourly wage I made 132, so overall I'm taxed on $417, leaving me a $65 dollar paycheck. 

So under my deductions there's FICA taxes and the Federal W/H, both were around 30 dollars each. But under the deductions it also includes my tips, of 285. Why do my tips appear under my deductions if they're being taxed as my wages? Again, sorry if this is a stupid question, and would appreciate an ELI5 answer that guides me in the right direction. 

My employer is having me file a new W-4 form also, and I'm wondering how many allowances I should claim. I'm single, not a head of household, and only have this one part time job. 

Is being taxed on my tips going to leave me screwed at the end of the year, or will I get some sort of return? I'm just really confused. Thanks so much to anyone willing to read this.",finance,1432413842

personalfinance,Should I buy a house?,"To begin with, I'm a 19 year old University Student. Next year i'm set to rent a house, i'll be paying $400 a month and will have a few roommates.

I was thinking that if i'm fine with having roomates and got a house, they would essentially be buying me a house. I've been looking at the numbers, and at current interest rates in my town, I could get a mortgage for about $850 a month. If I move in with 3 guys again, and charge them $400 each, i'll be making $350 a month and be living for free. I'll be here for another 2-3 years, so thats a few years of not having to pay my mortgage. Additionally, my Uni is a pretty good one and is growing, so property value for the area should only keep increasing until I graduate and sell.

If I get enough money together for a down payment, would it actually be as good as an idea as it is in my head? I'd probably have to go with the FHA loan or the Fannie Mae 3% option in order to afford it. Thanks for any advice!",finance,1432441157

Only accounting for my husband's income, we have a monthly deficit of $1292. I'm a commercial real estate broker (2 years in) so my income is incredibly volatile and hard to predict. I made my entire 2014 income ($60k) in the 4th quarter of last year. So it's hard to budget because I can go months without receiving a paycheck and there's no guarantee that I'll even get one. I'll need another couple years before my client base can sustain a stable income. We currently have $8k in our checking account as a cushion. My commission checks often exceed $10k so I'd like to have a strategy on which debts to hit first when I get these big lumps of cash. 

The interest rates on our credit cards are through the roof. I've called multiple times to get them lowered and they all tell me to buzz off. We've looked into consolidation but all the offers we've received feel kind of scammy. We've attempted to play the balance transfer game but get denied for new cards. We're thinking about going through our credit union (who holds our mortgage) to get a personal loan.

dogecoin,"daytraders, love them or hate them?","As a daytrader I have become kinda used to sorta getting scoffed at, but now I am going to take a stand and try to counter some of the arguments why I think people dislike daytraders. 

1. it increases volatility
A: As people compete to have thier orders clear the diffrance between buys and sells gets smaller. Without people looking to buy and sell on a daily basis the order books would be empty and obviously the price would fly all over the place. In less liquid markets like p2p trading it is more volatile for this reason.

2. Newbies get hurt.
A:I encourage newbies to start with a small amount and learn though experience. The fact you can get into trading currency with such low barriers of entry is one of the great features I tell people about, when introducing them to dogecoin.

3. they have weak hands.
A: they have weak hands for btc or whatever your trading for dogecoin equally as much. Having people buying dogecoin and holding it for even a moment gives that much more upward pressure. If these people had no hands it would be worse!

4. Its not a real job
A: its deff ""work!"" What other job in a first world country to you spend hours on a tedious task to be like noice made a few cents profit! To do well at trading you need to do research to. Not just the specs of the coin itself but market research. 

5. It doesnt spread the word to anyone else.
A: people often ask what I do to make a living, and then I end up explaining cryptocurrency to many people that have never heard of it. 

6. It slows our progress towards infinity/the moon.
A: Ok maybe so, but going back to the first point, it finds the true price. That way instead of getting to the moon and falling off right away there is a stable foundation of buyers below when it gets there. You get a real moon and not just a bubble that way. 

7. We should go in the ""creation of a currency road"" not in the ""lets learn trading and treat it like a speculative commodity road"". A: These goals are not mutually exclusive at all, in fact, they positively feedback on each other. Having good liquidity and a stable price attracts more people to use it as a currency, and more use as a currency attracts more people to speculate.

8. Daytraders give me a banker like vibe and I am a hippie.
A: Most crypto daytraders are not like wall st crooks. Generally we only trade money we actually have. Collusion doesn't work as well in this sphere because its easy to just backstab your partners with no consequence (ok that sounded banker-esque I will admit!)

personalfinance,Where to get the best personal loan.,"I'm less than 20K in debt thanks to student loans and I've been paying them off since I was in college. The federal loans payments aren't bad but I had to take out a private loan for one year. Those payments are kicking my ass so hard right now because they can't be consolidated or refinanced. After looking at how much I had to pay off with that loan I realized it was less than 10k. I just received a job that is paying me less but offers a chance for me to save money as long as I'm not making $700 payments every month like I am now with **just** that one loan.

My idea was to go to my bank (I opened my first account with them at 16 and have been loyal ever since) and talk about personal loans. If the loan interest was lower than I would take it, pay off my student loan debt, and not have back breaking payments for the next couple of months because by the end of my contract with my job next year I should have enough to pay off the personal loan if the monthly payments are even *half* of what I have to pay on my private loan now.

I went my bank (BOA) and was informed that they no longer give out personal loans. I'm kind of at a loss here because I went to a couple of other banks and credit unions only to be told that since I don't have customer activity with them they can't approve a loan.

Is there another way to get a personal loan that won't have a ridiculously high interest rate so I can get these back breaking student loan payments out of the picture?",finance,1432478506

As far as I know, he has not filed any federal taxes this year for his own pension or for his deceased wife's earnings. He claims that the state and town are paid, but I am having trouble confirming this, and when pulling up old records I keep finding old judgements for delinquent taxes, which make me think he is not filing properly or there is some other issue going on. Other family members have come to me concerned about his taxes, mortgage, etc. When I asked him about federal taxes he got very upset and just told me ""I didn't get anything from the IRS, so I wrote them a letter and didn't get anything back."" When I suggested we make a phone call or look over his documents, he yelled at me not to worry about it and that no one would be there to answer the phone because he read in the newspaper they are short staffed.

I'm 21 y/o, live at home, and have a good part-time job that makes min. wage + sales commission (av. $750/mo. after taxes). I'm finishing up Community College with an AA this coming school year and hope to transfer to a state school in Fall 2016.

My Father had a period of extreme financial success in the early/mid 2000s ($300,000-$500,000/yr av.) That success didn't last; he lost everything due to financial incompetence, and we've been living close to the wire ever since.

While doing the FAFSA, I've come to realize that you need a record of your parent's tax records to get a federal student loan: my parents haven't filed in 4 years. They've applied for extensions, payment programs, etc., but I don't think they have a record of any of it. Their financial records are just a huge pile of papers sitting in a closet.

If federal loans aren't an option, I want to know what my private options will be. I most likely won't be able to get a cosigner (my parents have the shittiest credit possible). I have a good GPA (3.5), I just opened up a credit card to start building credit, and I've reasoned that I can have $4,500 saved up by the time I move out (it sucks living at home, but no rent makes life so much easier). My girlfriend will be graduating University right before I'll be transferring to a 4 year, so she'll be looking for a full-time job to help with rent and general expenses. But a student loan will be on me to repay.

TL;DR - My Dad's a financial idiot, hasn't filed taxes in years, I don't think I can get federal student loans.

My questions are: 
1) How can I find out what my parent's tax situation is? They don't even know.
2) Will any bank give a 22y/o with limited credit history a decent student loan without a co-signer?
3) Should I consider not going to a 4 year and just getting my AA degree? I'm looking to go into an industry that doesn't value a bachelors incredibly highly, but it would help. And I'd just personally really like to study more and get a BA.",finance,1432492065

energy,Does the world need oil and gas from the Arctic?,"Last week at its annual shareholder meeting, Shell made it clear it will pick up its Arctic campaign again, after having been given permission from the Obama Administration two weeks ago to do so. In its annual Sustainability Reports, Shell insists that drilling in Arctic waters is justifed, because the world needs the oil and gas resources from that region. For example, in Shell’s Sustainability Report 2014, Ann Pickard, Executive Vice President Arctic and Alaska, says: “Exploration of the Arctic is important as future generations may have to depend on it for a significant amount of their energy, especially as the world’s population grows from seven billion to nine billion by 2050."" But I believe this is a misleading claim. It can be easily shown that the oil and gas in the Arctic can meet global demand for at most about a year. It is not the world but Shell itself that needs Arctic oil and gas. As Shell's own Investor Handbook 2014 shows, the company simply does not have that many other major options. I argue my case here: http://www.energypost.eu/shell-wants-go-arctic/ If you can shoot holes in it, please do!",energy,1432499555

It said DC's Office of Tax and Revenue never received my return for 2012, and that ""based on available information"" they gave a ""proposed assessment"" of $1900 in ""Assessed Tax"" and $580  in ""Interest"". 

I physically lived in DC from 2009 to October 2011. From October 2011 to December 2011, I was traveling overseas. From mid-December 2011 until mid-January 2012, I crashed on a couch in the DC house.

personalfinance,Should I apply for a loan with my Bank instead of the dealer?,"To keep things short and sweet, 

My credit is at 601, not because I've ever missed a payment, but because I've utilized most of my credit. I'll be paying it off as soon as graduation comes around. Basically what I'm asking is if there is any chance of my bank (well credit union) saying yes to my income/credit/no co-sign situation. I have steady employment history for at least 4 years, with the last 10 months at 20$/hr. I'll have about 40-50% down for the car, and a portion of my debt paid off before the new debt. 

I need a car for work, and no, bus is not an option considering the number of meetings I'll have for work, and I plan to drive for uber on nights and weekends to try and wipe my student loans out for good. 

Assuming no co-signer, with 601 credit, should I even apply to my bank? There's a number of dealers in my area that advertise no credit/bad credit okay. I know that these have outrageous interest rates, what I'm not sure is if there is penalty for paying off early(the only way that I would go with one of these is if there was no penalty for payment). Remember, that I desperately need a car for my new job. I'm buying used, not new. 

I've calculated my payments, insurance, gas, parking, etc.... I know what I need and what I can afford, etc.  I'll be on commission basis too if that makes a difference. 

Edit 1: I guess I never considered this before, in theory if I took all my money to pay off my debt (everything that isn't my student loans) had in person meetings with my credit union, would it be more likely to get approved? I wouldn't have much to pay down though.

 Like I said, my credit is only bad due to utilization rates, not missed payments.",finance,1432526343

personalfinance,Paying off CC debt or saving money for a house?,"Redditors, I need financial advice. Let me start with talking a bit about my situation. I got married about a year ago. Currently we live in an apartment but we want to buy a house which will cost about 350K. Our goal is to buy a house in two years.

I have 30K in student loans which I pay about $500 a month for. I also have about 35K in credit card debt. About $25K has deferred interest for 18 more months. This currently puts me at about 70% credit utilization ratio on my credit report.

So here is my question. Currently I can put $3000 aside after we go through all of our expenses to have a good life style. As I am thinking, there is two ways I can utilize this money:

1.) I can pay $3000 towards 35K CC debt which will clear my debt in one year. I can then start saving money for my house for a year which will total in $36K for down payment. With this much down payment, I will have to pay PMI though.

2.) I can immediately start putting $3000 aside for down payment. In two years, I will have 72K for down payment which will get me where I need to not worry about PMI. However I will need to get a mortgage loan with about 70% credit utilization shown on my report which I have no idea how much will affect my interest rate.

So, what should I do?",finance,1432530529

I feel like I've wasted the past 10 years of my life, but enough is enough, I've had it, I want to stop my self sabotaging.
 
 So this is where I stand right now, this is my current situation:

Right now I have a job at a nonprofit, which is really fulfilling since I feel like I'm doing a lot for people,  and I went back to school last year to get my law degree.

- My current income is $600 a month.
- My monthly rent is around $150.
- My Internet/phone bill is around $30 a month.
-  I have around the $150 in medical expenses a month.
- I spend around $80 a month in groceries.
- Another $40 in utilities.
- $20 in bus fares a month.
-  $10  for pet food.

 My debt:

- I have a $6000 debt, that is unpaid and defaulted. ( I couldn't pay it at the time for medical reasons,  that's a lame excuse, I know, but I still hope to pay it some day,)
- I owe $400 to my ex.
- I know another  $400 to my grandfather.
- $400 to a credit card with 49% interest (I kid you not, that's the interest rate)
- I owe $150 to my country's equivalent of the IRS,  I contacted them, and they said that they are not pursuing the pending fees, they pretty much told me that I can pay them if I want to,  I still want to do it though.

 My skill set:

- I can tear apart a computer and rebuild it in a couple of hours. (I used to work for a major gaming computer company).
- I speak three languages.
- I have a diploma in human rights. (I don't know what the American equivalent for  that would be)
-  I can code HTML, CSS, PHP, I can build websites in a couple days.

personalfinance,I'm moving to China for work (US citizen) -- how should I divvy up my money to minimize loss and make the most of what I take home?,"**First**, some background information from me. I currently work in South Korea, and in August I'm moving to Shanghai. I have a credit union account in Arizona, and two credit cards (Citi and BoA). I have $2174 in credit card debt (which I will have paid off in full by July) and $9500 in student loan debt which I've been in deferment for. Repayment starts in July. Interest on $8864 of it is 3.15%, and the remaining $621 is 5.35%.

I've accepted a job that doesn't pay so much, but for China it is quite good: 15500 RMB (2500 USD) gross, 13830 RMB (2230 USD) net.

Currently, I remit money through PayPal. Hana Bank in Korea has a relatively low fee to use their PayPal ""Global Pay"" service and neither PayPal nor my bank charge any fees once the money is in dollars. I lived in China before and used Paypal as well, but it was a bit more expensive. I do this because my credit union charges $10 for incoming foreign wires on top of intermediary bank wire fees. My credit union's savings account gives me 1.0% interest rate and the interest rates here in Korea are practically nothing. Plus, I can do this online, whereas a bank transfer in China must be done in person, and is subject to proof of income tax being paid.

Right now, I don't have a 401k or any investments. I have a pension through the Korean government, but I will have that (plus employer's contributions) refunded to me when I leave.

In China, the renminbi is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar, but every so often it's allowed to float, and it's said to be undervalued. It doesn't seem to fluctuate the way the Korean won does. I can store my money in an Alipay yu'ebao account, which is a money market account without minimum deposits or withdrawal limits, and which right now nets 4.185% annual interest compounded daily.

**Goals**: I want to start a retirement account and build a rainy day fund. I want to pay off my student loans in 3-5 years, and I want to minimize all of my fees, both in sending money home and in using foreign visas. I've converted one of my credit cards to a card with no foreign transaction fees, and I'm thinking about opening a Schwab checking account without fees.

As such, everything I buy will have a majority of what I purchase going onto my student loans. However, I am planning at refinancing in residency onto a 3.8% interest rate aggressive 5 year fixed payoff plan that begins once I enter my specialty. It has payments of $100/month during residency. (Medical residency is a paid position averaging between $45,000-$55,000/yr for those of you who are unfamiliar with the system.)


Three years ago, I needed to buy a vehicle. My parents really wanted me to get a Toyota, and were going to match my down payment. The only problem is they were insistent my monthly payment remain around $150 per month. The only thing I could get into for that was a 10 year loan, or a lease. Despite my thinking a 9 year loan at 1.2% interest on a new Nissan would be the better option, they threatened to pull cosignature (I had no credit at the time) and stuck me with a lease-purchase agreement that I can only look back and call a scam.


Point being, I have the option to buy a 2012 Corolla pre-tax, title, and fees for $12,008. I estimate it'll be around $13,060 after all of that is satisfied. I also have new tires, new brake pads, and a transmission flush that has to be done at some point in the next year. That'll add another $900 on average (got those figures from some websites that show average repair rates.) The average interest on a used car loan is 8.56%. That interest will be rolled into my student loan over the next 2 years.


There is another car I've been looking at. My sister works for a big chain of car dealerships, and is able to get me at factory invoice + $200 at all of their dealerships. With all of the other rebates and factory &amp; dealer incentives for this particular car, I've negotiated a 2015 Sonata hybrid for $20,085 before fees, and $22,593.93 out the door. The finance terms are 0% interest for a 72 month term loan.


When I analyzed it in an excel spreadsheet, the total cost of ownership difference between the two is under $4000. Of course the 2012 Corolla is the cheaper option, but is the $4000 difference worth the warranty, and presumably 3 extra years of life I'll get out of the vehicle?

In July 2014, I had the bright idea that I wanted to start a software startup out of my basement - I'm a recent college grad with a comp sci. degree who has always enjoyed tinkering in personal projects on the side, so lacking a job I thought I would create my own, hopefully getting some friends involved as well. 

I knew they, not having jobs either, might be more reluctant to start down an entrepreneurial path instead of searching for employment. In what I now in retrospect would consider a poor approach, I thought the best way to convince them to sign on would be to incorporate the company, *then* get them on board. I incorporated a C-corporation in the state of Delaware (I live in Massachusetts, but  every message board seemed to indicate that Delaware incorporation was a tip-top idea!) and got a registered agent there. I typed up some documents issuing the shares in the company, and ""paid"" the company $100 for a 50% ownership of the stock (the rest remaining in treasury).

However, the idea ended up being a flop. My friends were not interested, got jobs, and I eventually abandoned the idea as well without having made a single cent. I took a job, with the intent to simply close the company and move on, but a series of life events (including my mother getting sick, switching jobs after a few months, etc.) led to *both* me forgetting to close the company AND not filing my Federal Income Tax (with income of 0). The forms are months overdue, and I'm wondering if there is a (relatively) simple process for me to close the ""business"", seeing as it never had any income, had any employees, nor engaged in any ""business"" in any sense of the word.

Bitcoin,“CAR WASH” THIS! How the Blockchain could have prevented the biggest corruption case in Brazil’s history,"“CAR WASH” THIS!

How the Blockchain could have prevented the biggest corruption case in Brazil’s history

Blockchain for beginners

The Blockchain is the backbone of the Bitcoin protocol. It enables the Bitcoin network to reach consensus on which transactions should be validated or not in a transparent and decentralized fashion. 
There is no single entity or individual responsible for overseeing or approving transactions. It is a public ledger and the network oversees itself. Anyone can see the transactions happening in the Blockchain in real time through the Internet. 

There is a growing trend to use the Blockchain for much more than just processing bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions. The latest developments in the digital currency space have focused more on the power of the Blockchain technology for things such as data storage, titles, contracts and settlements than on the trade of bitcoin units. This new trend is called Bitcoin 2.0.

Companies from all sectors around the world are currently exploring ways to utilize this innovative technology. The list of companies that have already publicly announced initiatives in this front includes Samsung, IBM, UBS, NASDAQ and the Bank of New York Mellon.

The “Lava-Jato” (Car Wash) Operation 

Brazil’s state-run “big-oil” company, Petrobras, was the center stage for the biggest corporate corruption scandal ever put in place in the country’s history. Although investigations are still being conducted by the Ministério Público and the Polícia Federal, at least US$ 2.1 billion were diverted from the company just in bribe payments and illegal donations to political parties in the past 10 years, according to statements from Petrobras itself. A total of US$ 17 billion has been written off for related asset impairments as of April this year. 
The scheme involved contractors’ executives, Petrobras’ executives, political parties’ treasurers, black market foreign exchange dealers and ghost money laundering companies. The starting point of the “Lava-Jato” operation used to be the auction processes for projects in 5 different oil refineries. Around ten big construction and engineering companies allegedly formed a “club”, a cartel basically, and would stage bidding disputes but in reality they were colluding to inflate each project’s cost and pre-assigning winners in a rotational arrangement. The over budgeted amount would then be used to pay kickback bribes to executives and political parties and ensure the continuity of the scheme.

image

It is unquestionable that there was wrongdoing in each and every step of the operation but any attempt to prevent it would have to focus mainly in the two first steps: the auction process and the contracts handling and oversight. And that’s exactly where the Blockchain technology can be so powerful to make these processes transparent, auditable, yet fully secure.

Throwing light into darkness

According to recent articles by the press, the contractors organized themselves as a club, the “bribe club”. The public tenders budget and the bribes were pre-arranged between the club and Petrobras´ executives. The most obvious first step to make this process more legitimate would then be to open it to shareholders and the public.
New Bitcoin 2.0 startups such as Factom have created smart and versatile solutions to all sorts of data applications into the Bitcoin Blockchain. Factom actually works as a data layer on top of the Blockchain.

Running Petrobras’ public tenders using a solution such as Factom would allow every step of the process to be “hashed” and transformed into entry blocks building a chain of events. From the tender announcement, prospectus, every contractor’s bids, documentation, contracts, payments, everything would be securely stored and timestamped. The information would be organized into directory blocks which would allow someone to pull only the data that was available to him/her. These directory blocks would then stored into the Bitcoin Blockchain, which allows for real time auditing and instant verification against rules built in the entry blocks. For example, if one of the contractors was missing a certain required document, it would be detected instantly before the process moved forward. 

Most importantly, this would allow different levels of scrutiny and governance. For instance, the general public could be able to see the winning bids, their amounts, the date and time they were submitted and the name of the winning firms. On a higher scrutiny level, shareholders would be able to see all the competing bids but only after a winning bid was declared. On an even higher level, an internal compliance manager would be able to see all competing bids even before there was a winner and check for any potential conflicts of interest. External auditing firms would have access to contracts, payments and approvals in real time. Additionally, multi-signature arrangements could be designed to avoid giving too much discretion to a single executive in deciding the winning bids.

So why this can’t be done in a regular private network instead of Bitcoin’s public ledger? There are several reasons. The main one is that in this specific case there were empowered internal “bad actors”. At least three Petrobras’ directors were part of the scheme. If you are running a private and centralized network to perform the governance and record-keeping actions mentioned above, there are good chances that these “bad actors” will have power over the network to backdate, modify, forge, delete documents or audit trails in the private database. This cannot be done once the information is in the Blockchain. It creates immutable audit trails. 

While adopting such transparent and auditable business processes wouldn’t completely prevent the contractors from colluding and gaming the new system, the chances of them being successful in the long run would be significantly slimmer at the same time that the likelihood of an internal corrupt employee being caught would be dramatically higher. 

Implementing a Blockchain solution in any company should not be considered an easy task and in a state-controlled giant firm certainly wouldn’t be a walk in the park. In addition to the technology challenges, an immense political effort would be necessary. The Blockchain technology is still a novelty in many ways and a lot of its features still have to be developed, tested and re-tested. However, if we put things into perspective, when you have a fraud case of the magnitude of billions of dollars, in which a total of 97 individuals have already been indicted with charges, including politicians and government officials, then such an investment in transparency and governance starts to make a lot of sense. 

Whether this is all utopia or not we will only know in the future. However, the Brazilian people would certainly love to see ways to keep corruption away from their larger state-controlled company and be able to proudly say again: “O petróleo é nosso!” (“The oil is ours!”).

personalfinance,Lump Sum Payments - How to best use?,"Hi all, thanks in advance for considering my circumstances and for any advice you can offer. I've summarized some facts below, but the crux of my question relates to annual payments I am receiving and how to best use that money to secure success in the long term.

Through 2018, I will receive $36k (after taxes) annually - the total being $144k. I want to be sure that I use this money in a way that will give me a serious leg up in the long term rather than letting it trickle away over time through overspending.

I make enough on salary to cover my living expenses, max my 401k employer match, save money and enjoy life. Yes, I know I should be spending less on discretionary items and saving more, but I do fall victim to the mantra of ""only being young once."" I have a lot of fun with my friends and girlfriend, and am confident that as my earnings continue to grow, my expenses will not grow at nearly the same rate.

Basically, as you will see below, I am maxing my Roth contribution and contributing to maximum employer match in my 401(k). I have debt, but it is at pretty low interest rates. Should I direct the first of the payments to my debt and become debt free? Or should I invest elsewhere for a better return? I am willing to take on a fair amount of risk given my age and overall financial stability. I am not currently interested in home ownership because I will likely move to another part of the country/spend time living abroad in the next 5-10 years. That said, having 20% ready to buy a home down the road is one use I have considered for this money. 

Facts: 
22 year old male, living and working in Boston, making $60k + bonus, 10-15% annual increase (higher if stay with current job long term)

Monthly Income after Fed and State taxes, before Pre-tax deductions: $3650

Pre-tax deductions: 6% to 401(k), matched to 4.5%., contribute to HSA ($40/month). Employer contributes monthly amount to HSA equal to health insurance premium cost.

Monthly Expenses:
Rent: $1250 (ouch, I know, but this allows me to walk to work (save $75/month on transit, and greatly reduced stress when working long hours.)

Utilities: $100

Student loans: Minimum payments around $200, currently pay between $400/500

Car payment: $200

Auto Insurance: $100

Gas: $80

Groceries: $180

Restaurant/Bars/Discretionary: $250

personalfinance,Transition from hourly to salary while paying off debt,"Wall of text for background:

Looking for some insight into a transition from an hourly employee to a salary one. I had a review last week and I was asked if I would be interested in taking a promotion to the next level of employment. I was also told that I'm maxed out at my current bill rate and if I take a raise now instead of the promotion it would be marginal at best (I did the math on this and it seems to check out). I told them I was interested and am waiting for them to come back with a number. They also said the next meeting would be the beginning of negotiations (as to be expected). So here's the dilemma:

Married, 2 kids, wife stays at home so I can work excessive hours. My wife and I are 31

I currently make around 63.5k base and worked over 600 hours of OT last year and almost as much the year before. Between the base, OT, and performance bonuses (rare) I'm really pulling in around 90k (per 2014 taxes). I've gotten wind of the numbers they'll be offering and it's only about 72-75k, which in and of itself is good but a relative ""paycut"" overall (bonuses are rare and usually marginal at ~1% of base pay). I can take the ""paycut"" which gives me more breathing room long term financially, but I also know there will be tons of OT in the very near future and I'm anticipating the hours I currently work will be expected to be the same (fairly or not).


On top of this is the amount of debt we have: house, student loans, vehicles, and credit cards. We have around 80k in retirement savings between our 401k and my wife's roth IRA. We are currently running our debt through a snowball program and we're looking at being debt-free in 3-4 years (at my current rate plus OT) by using 0% interest xfers between cards. All but 1 card are 0%. My truck is close to being paid off (18 mo) and her car is a ways out. Student loans have low locked-in interest rates (2.875% and 4%).

Here are the options as I see them:

* Option 1: Stay hourly until debts are payed off. This gives us more flexibility now but I can't guarantee the OT will always be there.

* Option 2: Take the promotion and weather the storm. This will extend the snowball to 5+ years until payoff.

* Option 3: Cash out roth IRA about ~~15k~~ 8k(which is currently giving us limited returns) and pay off truck so we have an extra 400/mo to kick start the snowball effect into high gear. This would also allow me to take the promotion which opens up more financial opportunities over the next few years.

* Option 4: Double-down: Take the marginal raise, work my ass off on OT, cash out IRA (per Option3), and close the payoff gap and get shit done. Position will be available in the next year and take it then.

Any insight would be appreciated.

tl:dr - Not sure whether to take promotion with relative paycut as paying off debts will be more difficult.

personalfinance,"Paying off $40,000 in student loans and saving for retirement. I have some options to make my life easier - which should I take?","I'm 28 years old. I have about $40,000 in student loans. $10,000 is at 4.5% and 30,000 is at 6.2%. I have NO retirement savings. None. 

Starting in September I have a 12 month overseas teaching contract for $30,000 (tax free there and in US). I will also be living rent free. I will FINALLY have some money coming in! I plan on tutoring as well which will allow me to save a good portion of my salary.

So from reading and talking with others, having this much debt at these interest rates makes diverting money from my future paychecks into a retirement fund a bad idea, right? I would need a guaranteed return of more than 6.2%. However, I do want to get some money into a retirement fund now, rather than after the 2 to 4 years it's going to take me to pay off these loans.

First idea: I have the good fortune of having parents that could float me maybe...$5,000 to invest towards retirement this year. I would pay them off after I knocked out my student debt.

Second idea floated by father: They could take out a home equity loan, pay off the loans, and then I would pay them back at a much lower interest rate. Say the loan was then 4% or less, would it then be acceptable to invest while paying off the debt?

As of now we're just bouncing ideas around. Of course there's always the option of just doing this on my own like a fully independent adult, but I suppose when you have people in your life that can and want to help, why not weigh all of the options?

 1) Drip system, preferably gravity fed but possibly via water pump.  If I do this, how do I decide how much to drip, and how often?  And do I always drip the nutrient solution, or sometimes nutes/sometimes plain water?
 2) Ebb and Flood system.  If I do this, how do I determine how often to cycle and for how long?
 3) Self irrigating container.  Can I just put the nute solution in the base and let it go?

personalfinance,I just graduated from college. What advice do you guys have for starting my savings plan and situation in general?,"Hi all, 

Been lurking on this subreddit for quite sometime, thought I'd finally post something! I just graduated last week and am set to start work this early August. I will be a teacher but I will also be attending a graduate program! Here's the rundown:

What I have:

- 5k in bank account

- I'll be getting 1k as a kind of signing bonus to help me move in to the area and help with other expenses

- Starting September, my salary after taxes should be about 33k a year (40k taxed)

School costs:

- 3.6k for the cost of the graduate program (this summer only), the total cost of the masters degree would be about 18k. An interesting thing about this is that if I am placed into the right school, I could get this cost waived but I am just going to assume that that won't happen. Even if I do get it waived, I still have to pay the cost of the program first before I get reimbursed!

- 20k in student loans (15k in direct subsidized loans 5k in perkins, both just starting their grace periods with less than 5% interest rates on each individual loan)

What I'd like to do:

- I would like to save at least 25k after 3 years

- I would like to pay off all my student loans after 3 or 4 years

What I'm unsure about:

- Having a car and all the expenses associated with it

So I've done some quick estimations as to what my monthly budget would be like. After taxes, I would collect about $2700 a month. Monthly costs as follows:

Housing: ~500

Food: No more than 200

Transportation: 200 (carpool gas, uber, public transpo, etc)

Utilities: 150

Misc (going out, etc): 150

This would leave me with about 1500 to put towards savings, student loans, the potential costs of my graduate program, and also possibly a car. Presently, I figure that once I start working, I'll save as much as I can until the first payment of my loans needs to be done. I just wanted to ask you guys that with that 1500 leftover after living expenses, how do you guys think I should disperse that between savings, students loans, and potentially a car, as well as the costs of the graduate program?

I apologize in advance if I've left anything out. I would appreciate any advice, be it general or specific!

EUR/USD sank lower on Tuesday morning, as traders weighed up increasingly worrying signs that Greece may be about to default. Greek officials declared over the weekend that the country would be unable to make its June debt repayments to the IMF. Meanwhile European stock markets took a hammering after socialist party “Podemos” made significant gains in Spanish local elections. Podemos has an agenda similar to that of the Greek Syriza party, including an end to austerity, which is a condition of previous bailout agreements with the EU.

The dollar managed to consolidate its gains versus other currencies through exceptionally light markets. USD/JPY was nudging towards a six month high. The pair rallied to 122.33 overnight taking it to the top reach of the range that has trapped it since late 2014. The Japanese yen was trading cautiously ahead of a release of the latest Bank of Japan monetary policy meeting minutes. The yen also fell sharply versus the British pound and commodity currencies.

USD/JPY rallied towards a six month high ahead of the release of the latest BOJ meeting minutes

Today will see a raft of economic data that may help to throw more light on the state of the US economy and the possible course of interest rates. US durable goods orders will be in at midday (European time). The report covers orders for longer lasting manufactured items and analysts look at certain categories as a barometer of business spending and investment. The consensus is that orders (excluding the volatile transport category) will rise by 0.4% in April. If the report meets expectations, this will be the third consecutive monthly rise and will be a bullish indicator for the US dollar.

Also highly significant will be the consumer confidence report. The Conference Board’s survey is due later in the afternoon. Analysts have pencilled in a reading of 95 for May, just a notch down from a month earlier. A decent number will be essential to underpinning retail sales and consumer spending going forward. Likewise, the new home sales report is also worth watching as a barometer to the health of the consumer sector. Analysts expect new home sales to have risen by 510k in April.

DOLLAR BOUNCES BACK ON YELLEN REMARKS

EUR/USD fluctuated around the 50-day moving average and with a lack of momentum to push the pair decisively upwards. The dollar continued to see strong buying interest after Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s speech last week. Yellen surprised the markets with a hawkish tone, which suggest that rate rises are closer than had been anticipated. The Reserve Bank has been under pressure to offer markets clearer guidance to prevent any sudden shockwaves as were seen in the past. Most traders viewed the hawkish remarks as guiding the market back towards an expectation of rate hikes this year. Many had reduced bets of an early hike after sluggish first and second quarter results.

CABLE MOVES TO LOWER SUPPORT

Cable spent the session nudging lower. GBP/USD found support at 1.5428 but was unable to attract enough momentum to break upwards and reverse the strong downward trend that has been in place for the past two weeks. The price appears to be descending towards the 200-day moving average, which lies around the 1.54 level. Beneath this, support is likely around 1.5341. This marks the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line.

EUR/GBP bounced off lows of 0.7072 several times, but the euro remains pressured and the support level was not enough to prevent further drops. The pair touched a two and a half month low at 0.7069 on Tuesday.

BRENT RISES ON CHINA ANNOUNCEMENTS

Brent crude rose by over $1, taking the price of the front month futures contract to $65.83. The price had rallied over $66 per barrel earlier as markets cheered news that China will lower taxes on imported goods in an effort to spur consumer demand.

The New Zealand dollar saw a bounce after better trade figures came through overnight. The country’s trade balance stood at a surplus of $123M in April, topping expectations by $23M. That took the country to an annual deficit of $2.62B. The kiwi gained against the yen pushing NZD/JPY up towards 89.16. The Australian dollar also recovered ground spiking up as high as 95.61 against the yen.

I will call this 30k and say I have ~ 24 left over for savings.

I have a few questions and things I'd like to confirm going forward. 

I started a roth IRA account a little under 2 years ago and based on the amount it has increased, it has an interest rate of approximately 10% Now I know there is a lot of debate on whether roth IRA vs traditional is better. From what I understand it's based on income and future growth. I think that in 10-15 years my salary will be around 120 k and plateau there. I read on it for quite a bit and still can't figure what the best route for it is in order to optimize money in and money out. Could someone give me a little more guidance here on which kind of IRA I should put my money in? Or is this really more of a personal preference on what I think will happen to the economy?

My company offers 401 k and 6% matching and an additional 2% on top. I would like to take advantage of this, however I don't know very much about them and what their interest rates are, however I read that you can easily achieve 10%+ interest without too much risk. At first I was thinking I would pay off my student loans in 2-3 years, but after looking more into it, would it be more worthwhile for me to just pay the minimum monthly payment ($157) on my student loan and invest the rest that I was planning to put in into a 401 k ($250)? Is it actually easy to achieve 10%+ on a 401 k?

I also plan on buying a new car later around August, at first I also thought about paying this off fast (&lt;5 years) however I have a decent credit score (~750) and I think I can get a low interest loan for the car and finance it through a credit union. Although I know most people would suggest buying a used car, I will be buying a new one since I get a good discount on cars through my company. The discount is not a fixed amount, however, my friend bought a 25k car from them for ~21k. I'm looking at a 16k car, however, I have no idea what kind of minimum monthly payments I will to pay for it yet. Either way, I think it would be more beneficial to pay the minimum monthly on the car and take the extra and put it into the 401 k. Once again though this goes back to how much interest can get off a 401 k without much risk?

personalfinance,"Employer goofed on tax withholding for 2.5 years, now withholding an entire paycheck. Help!","Greetings, all. I'm hoping you can help me navigate a sticky wicket. My employer is planning on reporting an extremely large sum of ""imputed income"" -- the value of my domestic partner's health insurance over the past 2.5 years -- in my next paycheck to correct a ""mistake"" they first made in 2012. We're talking something in the neighborhood of $20,000.

This extra income comes with, in theory, a $5,000 tax liability. The rub is that, for the most part, I don't actually owe anything additional! My employer only made a mistake *in terms of their own policies and procedures,* which are to blindly withhold money for taxes on domestic partners' benefits just in case you owe it. Reality: *My domestic partner is also my tax code dependent. Her benefits aren't taxable; they aren't treated as imputed income.*

I'm looking for some advice from you on how to handle this. I can't afford to have money withheld from my paychecks unnecessarily. Further explanation below; feel free to skip to the questions ...

**Background:** My employer provides health insurance for domestic partners. In late 2012, my domestic partner needed coverage, so I added her to my plan. 

Fast-forward to last week. I get a phone call. It's a nice HR lady with some very bad news. Payroll discovered they'd been screwing up since 2012. They were ""supposed to"" be reporting the value of my domestic partner's benefits as income. They hadn't. Now, they're going to report two and a half years’ worth of ""imputed income"" at once in my next paycheck. (Bear in mind she's reporting what payroll told her.)

The long and short of it, I'm told, is that this extra ""income"" is going to result in an approximately $5,000 tax bill (note, this is in theory, as touched on above and explained further below). The ""system,"" she said, payroll informed her, is going to take my entire next paycheck and put it toward taxes. I'll then be left with $3,500 due at tax time.

However, according to everything I've read, a domestic partner's health benefits from your employer are NOT treated as imputed income IF your partner is also your TAX-CODE DEPENDENT (i.e. the value of the benefits doesn't appear on your pay stubs or W-2s). Except for the couple months in 2012 -- the last year in which I did not claim her as a dependent on my tax return -- she was and is my dependent.

**Long story short,** my employer is going to hold $1,500 hostage for the next six to nine months to satisfy a debt I don't, for the most part, even owe. Apparently, some employers verify whose domestic partners receiving benefits are also tax-code dependents and adjust things accordingly. Mine does not, meaning that they treat everyone as if they're going to owe taxes on imputed income. You just, I guess, have to wait until tax season to get your money back. Stupid ...

**So, questions:**

* Am I correct that since my domestic partner is also my tax code dependent (i.e. I claim her as a dependent on my tax return), the value of the health insurance she receives from my employer is not treated as imputed income?
* If my employer insists on wrongly treating the value of these benefits as imputed income, can they go back as far as 2012 to calculate it?
* If they insist, should they really be reporting the entire value in one paycheck or should they be fixing their books on a year-by-year basis and giving me corrected W-2s?
* If they should give me corrected W-2s, what would that mean for tax year 2012? Unless I am mistaken, the window to correct 2012's tax filing is closed.
* I am going to argue that they should use some logic and not withhold money for taxes unnecessarily. Is there any reason they shouldn't be able to make an exception in my case, particularly since they're the ones that goofed?
* Is there any other way you can think they ought to be going about this? Is there anything I should be doing differently?

I have to stop now or I am going to go insane. I've edited this post a couple of times before submitting it. I hope it makes sense. Thank you!

**ADDENDUM:** Well, I took so long to write this, that I actually received a follow-up phone call from the friendly HR lady (yes, she is actually friendly). Turns out the latest is that the supposed liability is up to $7,700. Also, when ""the system"" eats my next paycheck to satisfy this debt-on-paper-only, it's going to take the money that would normally go toward my healthcare contribution and retirement plan. I'm going to be in arrears in those departments and that money will get taken from the paycheck after this one! Ugh ...",finance,1432662130

personalfinance,Does it make more sense to split expenses equally or proportionally in a couple? What about if the majority of the income is scholarships? (CAN),"My fiancé and I [25M&amp;F] have been together for nearly a decade, file our taxes together and are technically common-law so, even though we're not officially married, we budget jointly and share a chequeing and savings account.

We're in a weird spot right now between him starting a job after a brief hiatus (I gave him 6 months to find a job after we moved for my grad program) and are just starting to join some of our finances.  We've agreed on a join chequeing and saving account with separate accounts for our 'allowances'.

I'd say he makes about $30000/yr while I make closer to $55000.  My income is tax free and $10000 of it goes directly to tuition.  The rest comes to me in the form of one cheque per semester and a handful of TA positions and research assignments throughout the year.

Now, where our incomes are so close, I really have no problem splitting the majority of our expenses 50/50.  My issue is that most of my income is in the form of a federal grant for research (and living expenses).

We have a rough budget but are waiting until we have the numbers for my summer research assignment to finalise things.  As much as I would be happy to split everything evenly if this income was from a 'normal job', part of me feels like I should be keeping some of the grant money back for research trips, books and specifically school related expenses.  Between student loan payments (his), saving for a wedding and sharing a joint 'fun' savings account, I feel like I at least warrant my own monthly amount put towards program-related costs.

Basically, I dread the day someone asks me why I couldn't afford to go to a conference when I have the money from this award and I tell them I give half of it to my fiancé.  This isn't how I would word it or how I feel, but it's how some of the people in my program would hear it.

Every time I asked her if this deleted the collections from my credit score she said yes, but I don't think me giving the ""balance in full"" letter is going to do that (sounds like it will just mark my collections as paid, not remove it). I also told her before I made a payment I would like them to send me a letter stating my balance, the payment plan we talked about on the phone, and the pay to delete but she kept saying that once I make a payment they will send a confirmation I was paid up (aka the payed in full letter). Thoughts?

TLDR: Debt collector says their is no settlement option on my account because their client (the hospital) does not allow it. Is this bullshit or correct? Also, will paying this debt off fix my credit score quickly or do I have to wait the 7 years for it to disappear from my credit score history?

Hello everyone!

I was linked to this subreddit by a friend and I am hoping to get some advice. I am 25 years old and never have had debt. I only purchase things on my CC when I know I have the money to pay it off immediately (sometimes I leave a 100 bux on the CC to help build my credit). I've never missed a payment on my CC and I have no student loans (I worked while going to school and paid them off in full). 

However, in OCT 2013 a 2400$ hospital bill I couldn't pay for because I was not working (and going to school) went into collections. I just spoke with them today and while there has been no interest applied (thank god) they won't negotiate on the price. The lady said that the hospital doesn't allow settlements on this type of account, so there is no negotiating the amount owed on the collectors end.

My question is, is this correct or am I being bullshitted? I thought you could settle on anything in collections but I'm being told otherwise. 

Lastly, I'm pretty sure my credit score has since tanked. During the last year and a half my credit limits went from $3500 and $4500 down to $1050 on both my cards. I'm also getting some bullshit loan offers that have the excellent interest rate of 99 fucking percent. I know I need to check my credit score but will paying off this debt immediately raise my score up quite a bit or do I have to wait roughly 7 years or w.e?

Longer version I apparently didn't know what I was doing when I bought the SUV, and paid $20,838 (including all the crap you shouldn't buy from the finance guy) on a $17,000 vehicle. Then signed up for a 7.49% interested rate over 60 months to boot. IO didn't consider the interest rate to be that bad at the time since my credit rating was 550 at the time. Since the interest rate is so high, it seems like the right call to refinance, but since I'm trying to rebuild my credit, I'm gun shy on nearly anything involving my credit now until my debt is significantly lower. Beyond Capital One, I'm not sure who to even contact about refinancing. All of the online options I tried to look at had buried in the fine print they plan on selling my personal information and calling me non stop (I'm looking at you lendingtree.com).

personalfinance,Low interest student loans - Debt free or invest?,"Hey PF, quick question based off a thread here I can't seem to find again...

I have about $16,000 left in federal student loans at 3.8% interest rate. I've already paid off the all the higher interest rate loans, but I'm not sure what to do now.

I'm currently maxed out on my 401k employer match contribution, pay off credit cards monthly, and have about 3 months' paycheck of savings.

Is it better to make myself debt free faster by continuing to aggressively pay off student loans, or pay the minimum and use excess to start investing in something higher than 3.8% now?

TLDR: pay off student loans at 3.8% interest, or invest for higher returns?",finance,1432692766

personalfinance,Medical Student trying to sort through all the rumors about loans and need help understanding my options,"So a little background. I'm in a 6-year program in which the first two years I am an undergraduate student, and then after that I become a graduate medical student for the next four. Tuition changes, but very slightly, so all-in-all, I'm looking at a lot of loans. 


&gt; So for my first two years:
&gt; 
&gt; University charged me: $77,000
&gt; 
Parents paid for me: $40,400

&gt; Navient Loan: $6,600 [3.86% interest--Stafford loan]-deferred

&gt; Myfedloan: $30,000 [6.16% interest--Parent plus?]-$400 due monthly

&gt; Wells Fargo: $15,000 [goofed and took this accidentally]-deferred


So my real goal is to get rid of the Myfedloan and the Wells Fargo. The Myfedloan is a burden on my parents and I want to get it deferred if possible, so I was thinking of taking another loan to pay it off, one that would be deferred. The Wells Fargo loan was a mistake because we messed up math and it got sent to us in a check that my dad invested. I'm calling them tomorrow to find out how to access my account and figure out the interest rate on that.

And then, starting this summer, I'm a graduate medical student. So I'm now eligible for graduate loans, including higher amounts. And this is where a lot of the confusion comes in. Of off AAMC's website, it says I'm limited to $40.5k annually, but my school will cost me $46k annually. At the same time, the next paragraph says I'm limited to $224k over my lifetime, so does that mean I'm expected to stay in medical school for 6 years? This confuses me greatly. My initial plan was to take this larger unsubsidized stafford loan so that I could repay the Myfedloan as well as the Wells Fargo loan, and my tuition (living expenses are not a factor). However, due to this annual limit, I don't know if I can.

The last thing is the rumors I've heard all my life about government will forgive my loans yada-yada. Basically it amounts to three things I've heard. I've done research and have found very little in the way of official sources, more just corroboration of rumors. 

1. If you do your residency in an underprivileged area, the government will take care of your loan.
2. If you have an 8 year residency and then pay 2 years of your loan at full monthly price, then the government will take care of the remaining based on some 10 years volunteer clause or something.
3. As part of a residency/doctor signing bonus, they pay off the remainder of my loan

Can anyone give me more information about any of these rumors, or point me to where I can find out the full story.

personalfinance,What should I do with my extra money for the next 8 months? I really value this sub's feedback.,"My wife and I are in a position we've never been in before, in that we've saved up enough for a down payment on a house in our price range ($200,000-$250,000).  Our lease is up in January 2016 and we are planning to purchase a home then.  

We are currently running a $2-3000 surplus each month (I am paid a base salary plus commission, so there is some variance in our monthly surplus).  This may increase to $4-5000 per month if my wife passes the background check for a job she has been offered (which she should, she's never been in trouble with the law and has great references).  Even if something happens and the job falls through, I would estimate around a $3000 average surplus for the next 8 months (this is conservative because the next 8 months are the busier time of year for my job).

Our IRAs have been maxed out for the year.

We have saved a six month cash emergency fund.

We have no student loan debt, no credit card debt (we pay the cards off in full every two weeks), and no medical debt.

The only debt we have is two car loans:

Car 1:  $16,000 remaining, just under 4 years left on loan, 1.49% interest.

Car 2:  $17,300 remaining, just over 4 years left on loan, 2.25% interest

We plan to keep each car for at least 10 years.

Options I am considering for our surplus money:

1.  Use our surplus money to invest in Vanguard index funds (lazy retirement strategy).  

2.  Use our surplus money to pay down Car 2's loan, as it has the higher interest rate.

3.  Put half our surplus in index funds, and half towards Car 2.

4.  Something better that /r/personalfinance suggests ;)

The reason I am struggling with this is because the car loan interest rates are so low.  Looking purely at long-term market returns, the obvious answer would be to throw money at the index funds.

However, the stock market is near record highs these days, which is the worst time to put money in the market.  I'm not trying to time the market, but I've been unlucky in the past just trying to get money in the market.  Right now I feel like I'd prefer to take the 2.25% return paying off Car 2 would give me because the market is so high.  

There's also the fact that paying down the car debt will help get us a lower interest rate on our mortgage (correct me if this is wrong).  We'll save much more in the long run by having a lower mortgage interest rate (and also save on car insurance if the car is paid off, but this is probably minimal).

In addition, there's the psychological factor.  Until we purchased our cars last year, I'd never been in debt in my whole life.  I don't particularly care for it.  I'd like to pay some of it down before we take on even more for the home.  That being said, I'm an adult and can learn to deal with it if paying the car loans off for the next four years is the smart play.

What should I do?

investing,Effects of Various Economic Conditions on the Markets,"When I asked Pauline about writing a second guest post here, she suggested I talk about factors that will affect the average investor’s retirement nest egg. So in this post, I’ll be discussing the various economic and historical conditions that will affect investors in the medium tern (1-5 years) and long term future (5 to 10 years out), and how you can prepare yourself when each of these conditions hit.

Inflation
Without going into the arcane and pointless details, I’ll explain QE (quantitative easing) in good ole’ plain English. QE is the Federal Reserve’s way of printing money, thereby injecting more and more liquidity (money) into the financial system. Bernake (Fed Chairman) believes that this will pull the American economy out of the muck for good, and right now, whether this is working or not is still questionable.

HOWEVER, quantitative easing does have a problem – the printing of money theoretically speaking should cause inflation. But since QE first began, inflation has been virtually non-existent. How come?

According to theory, printing money causes inflation. BUT, what the economy has been experiencing post-recession is a deflationary environment. The economy isn’t doing too well, and prices should be declining. But with the Fed’s printing of money, the deflation is negated, resulting in zero inflation.

However, sooner or later (probably sooner, along the lines of 1 – 2 years) inflation is going to (finally) pick up. Why? Think of it this way. Deflation has always existed, and the Fed’s printing of money has been negating this deflation. However, soon that negation will be over (when the inflation is sufficient enough to totally negate the deflation), and the printing of money will finally cause real inflation.

So what do you do when inflation hits? Historically speaking, investors think that inflation is bad for stocks. That’s a huge misconception. This misconception only exists because stocks went flat in the 1970s when inflation was huge. HOWEVER, the 1970s were an anomaly – we experienced stagflation, when inflation was coupled with a sagging economy. In most cases, inflation occurs in a growing economy (or in today’s case, a nominally growing GDP). I believe that this time around, the recovery is real and that we’re not going to experience stagflation.

Hence, I think that buying stocks would be great when inflation hits. When inflation comes around, currencies get devalued and nominally speaking stock prices rise, leading to greater returns for equity investors.

Devaluation
Devaluation is closely linked to inflation – when governments print money, the real value of their currencies becomes devalued. Whenever currencies get devalued, all hard assets such as stocks and commodities shoot up in price. Speaking of commodities…

The Once in a Lifetime Opportunity
People believe that precious metals are a hedge against an economic downturn. Again, that’s a misconception. When the 2008 recession hit, precious metals (gold and silver) actually fell the hardest. This misconception originates (again) from the 1970s when a crappy economy was coupled with soaring gold and silver prices.

Precious metals rose in the 1970s not because of the poor economy but because of inflation. The 1970s were a rare case of stagflation, something that doesn’t fit in with today. Currently, the economy is humming along, but inflation will be a big issue. Thus, when inflation starts to creep up it will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for medium term investors who are willing to hold onto their gold and silver positions for at least a year.

The Fight for Resources
There’s a prime fundamental reason (besides inflation) that supports the rise in commodity prices (especially gold and silver). It’s simple. We have fewer and fewer resources to feed a larger and larger population. When Thomas Malthus first predicted that the world would end (this was back in 1798), he forgot to factor in technology. Technological improvements can increase the efficiency at which we extract our resources. HOWEVER, even technology has a limit. The efficiency is ultimately limited to the amount of resources we have. Currently, the world is reaching a turning point. If all the emerging market nations start to consume at the rate Americans do, the world’s resources would be gone sooner rather than later. When the demand for raw materials goes up and the supply goes down, prices will soar.

Historical Charts
You’ve all heard it – historically, the U.S. stock market has yielded (on average) 7.5% returns. That’s actually a really clever lie concocted by brokers and financial groups to get you to purchase equities.

The “average of 7.5%” is from the post-War period. If you look at a different time frame, such as if you were to include the Great Depression, the “average rate of return” is a lot less. That’s what the financial industry does – repackaging facts to make them look better than when they first came in.

The post-war period is actually an anomaly, a period of unprecedented economic growth that is unlikely to be repeated again in the near future. This growth was caused by major technological revolutions, from household appliances to computers to the internet and high speed communications. Today? Come on guys – the market is going to grow at 7.5% with a bunch of undergrads making $0.99 iPhone apps.

My point is, if the stock market is going to pick up its pace in the long run, it needs to be supported by major technological leaps. Unfortunately, since the dawn of the internet our society’s brightest have been attracted towards the fast money of internet riches, drawn away from solid industries that actually contribute to mankind’s life (think of space mining, green energy – the capital intensive industries). Thus, without any major technological revolutions happening right now how can we expect economic and market growth to pick up? We can’t. There’s no driver for the growth engine.

The Summary
To sum it all up, I’m going to divide things into two time frames. The medium time frame is the 1-5 year outlook, whereas the long term outlook is 5-20 years.

For the medium outlook, things are looking decidedly positive. Once inflation picks up (which is inevitable with all the money printing), stocks and commodities are going to soar, particularly gold and silver whose bull markets aren’t over.

However, the long term is less positive. Sure, the stock market will still experience long term bull markets. But I don’t think the average rate of return will be 7.5% anymore, unless we experience another major technological breakthrough. The problem is that these breakthroughs are the results of years and years of work, something that hasn’t happened thanks to all our smartest engineers being attracted to industries that do not really contribute that much to mankind. (I like Facebook as much as the next guy in line, but hey, it hasn’t had as much an impact on my life as the advent of the computer has.)",finance,1432709609
personalfinance,Roth IRA - Thinking of switching from USAA,"So I will start off by saying I've read the Wiki/FAQ and quite a few of these USAA vs Vanguard, etc IRA posts but now I'm even more confused about what I should do. 

I switched all my banking to USAA about 3 years ago for better interest rates and for a 2.99% loan to pay off my college loan debt that had a higher interest rate.

I knew I should be investing so I did some research and started my Roth IRA through USAA about 2 1/2 years ago with 2 mutual funds with $4000 and a minimum investment of $100 a month thereafter. 

I got the USBSX - Cornerstone Moderate Fund https://www.usaa.com/inet/imco_mutualfund/ImFundFacts?action=INIT&amp;fundNumber=0047&amp;fundCategory=AA
and the USAWX - World Growth Fund. https://www.usaa.com/inet/imco_mutualfund/ImFundFacts?action=INIT&amp;fundNumber=0054&amp;fundCategory=EQ

Looking back on it I wish I knew more than I did, but I'm not disappointed in my decision and am glad I'm able to put money into it every month and its made money each year so far.

Currently I have $458.33 every month automatically transferred into the IRA (roughly 70% to the world growth, 30% to the cornerstone moderate) to put $5,500 in per year(which I plan to continue to do). The dividends I get are automatically reinvested. Currently the IRA is worth $14,500 but after reading other similar posts, I think the expense ratio on these is going to cost me quite a bit of money compared to Vanguard or Schwab. I like the idea of me having to do nothing but have the money taken out of my account every month and watching my account grow not having to do any maintenance. Should I continue to do this? I think I'm making a good move but could I be doing things better?

I guess ultimately what I would like to know is should I make the switch to Vanguard or another company to avoid the high expense ratio? It seems as though I could save thousands in the long run with the expense ratio.  Would I lose any of my current money by rolling it over to another investor?

Which I now want to do (this isn't a very important amount of $$ but hey, when you're a student every penny counts right?).

personalfinance,Used car vs new car,"I need to buy a car, and I've been doing a lot of reading up on what to buy. Right now, I can spare upto $5k. In two months, I'll start my first job and then money will start pouring in. 

Now this is going to be my first car, and I'm 24. One option is to buy a used car, something from 3k to 6k, from an owner, use it for a few months and then buy a new really nice car, like a top end Honda Accord or so. The advantage with this is, I have the money now for this, and no loan issue, and I get some time to ""burn in"" with a cheap car. The problem is it may be an unreliable seller, (Craigslist the best option for the cheapest deals?) and I may have repair headaches. 

The second option is to buy a car in the 6k to 14k range. I'll have to take a used car loan for that and that will be expensive, like a 4% interest rate probably. I was seriously considering this earlier, but I noticed that it doesn't really seem that I'm getting the best value for money with this option. With this, I will look at dealers as well as private owners. Dealers charge a lot extra though. I won't get a really awesome car with all the things I'd love to have, but I'd have a pretty good car. I'd probably use the car for 2-3 years. Won't have the patience to last longer because I'd crave for a better model.

The last option is something I never considered earlier, but I'm seriously considering now. Buying a new car. This will be expensive of course, but a lot of reddit posts made me look at the advantages of getting a new car with no headaches, getting 0% APR and a good value for money. 

Above all, value for money is very important for me. And then, reliability is important. I don't want to deal with repairs and breakdowns at all.

investing,How to analyze a property as an investment,"I know you are busy.

However, just because you are busy – doesn’t mean you shouldn’t seek to find an amazing deal when shopping for a rental property. In fact – I believe it’s because of your busy life that finding the best deal is so important. You don’t want to be stuck with a property that drains your time, empties your wallet, and makes you want to throw your tenant’s belongings off a twelve-story building.

Shopping smart is key, but at the same time – smart shopping doesn’t need to take forever. There are several “quick and dirty” techniques you can use to look at an investment property and decide if it’s something worth pursuing. This post is going to share my method for finding the best needles in the real estate haystack.

 How to analyze a property as an investment

What Metrics to Measure
For me, cash flow is king.

Cash flow, in it’s simplest definition, is the profit left over in my bank account after all the bills have been paid on arental property. For example, if a property rents for $500 per month and all my expenses for the month come to $400 – then I’ve just made $100 in cash flow.

Cash flow is important because it adds money to my bank account each month, rather than take money away. It helps me save more and gives me a scorecard for measuring my investment’s potential.

The other side of the coin is “appreciation,” which is the value gained when real estate prices rise. While appreciation is a welcome thing, (I love when my property values rise) I don’t use appreciation to determine a good deal. After all – there is no way of predicting the future since my crystal ball broke last year. Appreciation is simply the icing on the cake, but should not be used to determine an investment’s future value. Again – for me, it’s all about cash flow.

So how much cash flow is good? We’ll get to that in a minute, but first- let’s look at the quick and dirty way to calculate it.

Knowing Your Expenses: The 50% Rule
One of the most valuable “tools” to a real estate investor is known as the 50% rule. This “rule of thumb” states that for a real estate investment – the non-mortgage expenses will usually average out to about 50% of the rent.

Huh?

Let me explain. If you own a 4-plex that brings in $2,000 per month – you can probably assume that over the long run, this property is going to cost $1000 per month in vacancies, maintenance, and other charges (not counting the mortgage.)

Now, it’s easy to estimate your monthly cash flow by simply taking the amount of money you have left (known as the Net Operating Income) and subtracting out the monthly mortgage payment – which you can find using any online mortgage calculator. My favorite is this one.

For the example we’ll use in this post, let’s assume we bought the 4-plex for $140,000 and put a $28,000 down payment for a total loan amount of $112,000. At an interest rate of 5% for 30 years, the loan payment works out to approximately $600 per month. Additionally, this four plex rents for $500 per unit, per month, for a total of $2,000 per month in rental income.

Going back to that first example, here’s how it would look:

Monthly Rent: $2,000 per month

-$1,000 per month (50% Rule)

- $600 per month (Imaginary mortgage payment for this example)

———————————————————

= $400 per month in cash flow.

Now – you may be tempted to argue with me that 50% for expenses is high – and maybe you are right. However, this “rule of thumb” has been used by a lot of seasoned investors for many years for one reason: because it seems to just work. Maybe you’ll have no expenses for several months, and then be hit with a ton (like me, this month!) Maybe your roof will go bad and need to be replaced. Maybe the heating system will go out. Maybe you’ll have an eviction. The 50% rule allows you to look at cash flow over the long run, which is why I advocate using it. If it ended up being less – you win! But at least you won’t be tempted to buy a property that is actually going to cost you money to own (negative cash flow…bad.)

So, back to our example… is $400 per month in cash flow good? Well, maybe. Let me explain how I determine it.

How Much Cash Flow is Right?
For me – it comes down to 3 different methods:

Return on Investment: Your return on investment is the tool used to calculate your investment’s use. If a $1,000 investment gave you $100 in profit over a full year, your ROI (return on investment) was 10%. So, let’s look back at that example of the four-plex. We determined that we could expect about $400 per month in cash flow with a $600 per month mortgage payment and a $28,000 investment (down payment.) $400 per month is $4,800 per year. $4,800/$28,000 = 17.14% return on investment. Also keep in mind that this ROI does not include any appreciation, tax benefits, or loan pay down (each month, the balance on the loan drops a little bit.) Officially, this number is known as your “cash on cash return on investment” and is a good way to compare your investment with other investments like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
Per-Unit-Profit: Even more quick and dirty than the ROI measurements, sometimes it’s enough just to look at the “profit per unit.” This means – if I were to buy this property, would I clear a certain price per unit in cash flow? This is truly the “quick and dirty” way to analyze a property: begin with the total monthly income and use the 50% rule to take out the expenses. Next, subtract the mortgage amount. Using the example we discussed earlier, the fourplex supplied $400 per month in cash flow – or $100 per unit, per month – which is the minimum amount I’d ever generally accept though I like to see $200 per unit, per month.
The 1% Rule
Another “rule of thumb,” I should mention, and the fastest way to quickly decide if a property is worth pursuing, is known as the 1% rule. The 1% rule states that an investment property should rent for at least 1% of the purchase price. So, the fourplex we discussed earlier – which was bought for $140,000 – should bring in at least $1400 per month in total income (which, according to our example, it does meet.)

Some investors choose other ratios, such as the 1.5% rule or the 2% rule to achieve greater returns and greater cash flow. I typically won’t buy anything below 1.5% and try to aim for 2%, though your percentage may depend on your location and risk tolerance.

Conclusion
Did I lose you? Hopefully you stuck with me on these calculations!

The methods I mentioned above can be used to quickly analyze an investment property for further investigation. With thousands of properties listed for sale at any time, it’s simply impossible to do a thorough analysis of each. This is why these “quick and dirty” methods can be great for filtering properties and only looking at the best options.

One final disclaimer: never buy a property based entirely upon one of these methods. This is a way to filter out the 99% of properties that are not good deals and only focus on the best. Do your homework and learn what the actual expenses and income are, and buy amazing properties.

No matter how busy you are – I encourage you to spend some time trying out your new math skills to analyze some properties. Once you are good at it, you’ll be able to decide if a property is worth pursuing in just seconds – saving you time and helping you build wealth at the same time.",finance,1432726461
Bitcoin,“CAR WASH” THIS! - How the Blockchain could have prevented the biggest corruption case in Brazil’s history,"“CAR WASH” THIS!

How the Blockchain could have prevented the biggest corruption case in Brazil’s history

Full article: https://flowbtc.net/research/CarWash_This.pdf

Blockchain for beginners

The Blockchain is the backbone of the Bitcoin protocol. It enables the Bitcoin network to reach consensus on which transactions should be validated or not in a transparent and decentralized fashion.

There is no single entity or individual responsible for overseeing or approving transactions. It is a public ledger and the network oversees itself. Anyone can see the transactions happening in the Blockchain in real time through the Internet.

There is a growing trend to use the Blockchain for much more than just processing bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions. The latest developments in the digital currency space have focused more on the power of the Blockchain technology for things such as data storage, titles, contracts and settlements than on the trade of bitcoin units. This new trend is called Bitcoin 2.0.

Companies from all sectors around the world are currently exploring ways to utilize this innovative technology. The list of companies that have already publicly announced initiatives in this front includes Samsung, IBM, UBS, NASDAQ and the Bank of New York Mellon.

The “Lava-Jato” (Car Wash) Operation

Brazil’s state-run “big-oil” company, Petrobras, was the center stage for the biggest corporate corruption scandal ever put in place in the country’s history. Although investigations are still being conducted by the Ministério Público and the Polícia Federal, at least US$ 2.1 billion were diverted from the company just in bribe payments and illegal donations to political parties in the past 10 years, according to statements from Petrobras itself. A total of US$ 17 billion has been written off for related asset impairments as of April this year.

The scheme involved contractors’ executives, Petrobras’ executives, political parties’ treasurers, black market foreign exchange dealers and ghost money laundering companies. The starting point of the “Lava-Jato” operation used to be the auction processes for projects in 5 different oil refineries. Around ten big construction and engineering companies allegedly formed a “club”, a cartel basically, and would stage bidding disputes but in reality they were colluding to inflate each project’s cost and pre-assigning winners in a rotational arrangement. The over budgeted amount would then be used to pay kickback bribes to executives and political parties and ensure the continuity of the scheme.

image

It is unquestionable that there was wrongdoing in each and every step of the operation but any attempt to prevent it would have to focus mainly in the two first steps: the auction process and the contracts handling and oversight. And that’s exactly where the Blockchain technology can be so powerful to make these processes transparent, auditable, yet fully secure.

Throwing light into darkness

According to recent articles by the press, the contractors organized themselves as a club, the “bribe club”. The public tenders budget and the bribes were pre-arranged between the club and Petrobras´ executives. The most obvious first step to make this process more legitimate would then be to open it to shareholders and the public. New Bitcoin 2.0 startups such as Factom have created smart and versatile solutions to all sorts of data applications into the Bitcoin Blockchain. Factom actually works as a data layer on top of the Blockchain.

Running Petrobras’ public tenders using a solution such as Factom would allow every step of the process to be “hashed” and transformed into entry blocks building a chain of events. From the tender announcement, prospectus, every contractor’s bids, documentation, contracts, payments, everything would be securely stored and timestamped. The information would be organized into directory blocks which would allow someone to pull only the data that was available to him/her. These directory blocks would then stored into the Bitcoin Blockchain, which allows for real time auditing and instant verification against rules built in the entry blocks. For example, if one of the contractors was missing a certain required document, it would be detected instantly before the process moved forward.

Most importantly, this would allow different levels of scrutiny and governance. For instance, the general public could be able to see the winning bids, their amounts, the date and time they were submitted and the name of the winning firms. On a higher scrutiny level, shareholders would be able to see all the competing bids but only after a winning bid was declared. On an even higher level, an internal compliance manager would be able to see all competing bids even before there was a winner and check for any potential conflicts of interest. External auditing firms would have access to contracts, payments and approvals in real time. Additionally, multi-signature arrangements could be designed to avoid giving too much discretion to a single executive in deciding the winning bids.

image

So why this can’t be done in a regular private network instead of Bitcoin’s public ledger? There are several reasons. The main one is that in this specific case there were empowered internal “bad actors”. At least three Petrobras’ directors were part of the scheme. If you are running a private and centralized network to perform the governance and record-keeping actions mentioned above, there are good chances that these “bad actors” will have power over the network to backdate, modify, forge, delete documents or audit trails in the private database. This cannot be done once the information is in the Blockchain. It creates immutable audit trails.

While adopting such transparent and auditable business processes wouldn’t completely prevent the contractors from colluding and gaming the new system, the chances of them being successful in the long run would be significantly slimmer at the same time that the likelihood of an internal corrupt employee being caught would be dramatically higher.

Implementing a Blockchain solution in any company should not be considered an easy task and in a state-controlled giant firm certainly wouldn’t be a walk in the park. In addition to the technology challenges, an immense political effort would be necessary. The Blockchain technology is still a novelty in many ways and a lot of its features still have to be developed, tested and re-tested. However, if we put things into perspective, when you have a fraud case of the magnitude of billions of dollars, in which a total of 97 individuals have already been indicted with charges, including politicians and government officials, then such an investment in transparency and governance starts to make a lot of sense.

Whether this is all utopia or not we will only know in the future. However, the Brazilian people would certainly love to see ways to keep corruption away from their larger state-controlled company and be able to proudly say again: “O petróleo é nosso!” (“The oil is ours!”).

&gt; If you have any private variable loans, pay those off first.

personalfinance,"PSA: Money can't be moved to a different country and ""earn"" higher interest just because rates are higher","FX trader here.  I see a lot of Americans complaining about 0% interest rates. 



While other countries may offer higher interest rates on paper, you must also consider differences in exchange rates and in inflation.



As pointed out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/37e8ng/instead_of_a_5_raise_my_job_gave_me_a_500_raise/crm4ol4), one New Zealand bank offers 4.3% interest.



While this sounds amazing compared to the 0% earned in a US bank account, the rule of thumb, is that there is no free lunch.  
To keep it short: In a perfect world, inflation and exchange rate fluctuation would keep the real interest earned on $US and NZD the same.  When comparing two countries, covered interest rate parity says that the currency with the higher interest rate will depreciate by the difference in rates.  If the NZD interest rate is 4% higher than the US rate, this says that the NZD is expected to depreciated by 4% over the course of the next year.  



In reality, fluctuations are much wider, but if you looked over the past year, changes in exchange rates have VASTLY benefitted the American over the New Zealander.  While the US interest rate has been low for many years, the $US has appreciated considerably vs other currencies to compensate for this.  



**Here's an example:** On May 2014, an American moved $100 to New Zealand to take advantage of higher interest rates.



May-2014 exchange rate: *0.86 USD/NZD*



May-2015 Exchange rate: *0.72 USD/NZD*



These are the amounts of US Dollars that 1 NZ Dollar would buy.  

1.  American investor changes **$100US** to NZD in May 2014.  He recieves **116NZD**.  ($100/0.86 = 116)

2.  The investor happily recieves 4.3% interest over the course of the year in the New Zealand bank and in May-2015 he has **121NZD**.  116*1.043 = 121

3.  The investor converts his money back to $US to buy his friends ice cream with the earnings.  Unfortunately he only recieves **$87US** (121*0.72 = 87)

4.  The investor would have ultimately been better off keeping his money in $US, earning 0% ($100x1.0017 = $100)  **$100 vs $87**.



Differences in inflation rates between the two countries will also play a factor.  It is not as big of a deal in this case since New Zealand and United States are stable countries with about 2% inflation depending on who you ask.

**tl:dr** no free lunch in other country's interest rates.  Look for investment income from equities or bonds if you are interested in that sort of thing.  



EDIT: Others are pointing out that slippage, taxes and transactions cost would be enough reason not to do this anyway.  The point is that 10% interest rates overseas in Utopia-land is not what it seems.  I would say, as a little guy, do not convert money to another country unless you are moving/travelling/have some personal reason for doing so.  Do not spend your time worrying about changes in exchange rates, as it is akin to trying to predict tops/bottoms in the stock market.",finance,1432734616

Thankfully, the fire happened before the end of the month, which means her homeowner's insurance was still valid.  The insurance company paid for the house to be rebuilt.  The insurance company made an initial payment to the contractor (one that I hired, but the insurance company approved) at the start of the rebuild.  The house took a year to complete.  Thirty days after the house was finished (June, 2014), the insurance company sent a check for the remaining amount- with both the contractor and myself (as my mother's executor) on the check.  I hand delivered the check to the contractor's office, shook hands, said thank you and that was that.  The house was sold with my sister and I splitting the proceeds. About 45 days ago, I get a letter from the insurance company stating the final check was never cashed.  They enclosed another check, this time, just my name was on the check.  I contacted the contractor's office- the guy that I used to deal with was no longer there.  I spoke with the office manager and she said she wasn't sure what the issue was, she would have to pull the file and get back to me.

Basically – I currently live in a loft apartment in a college town where rents are extremely overpriced because people move around too often.  I found a cute little 2 bedroom house right near where I currently live and enjoy life with an asking price of 92k$ in the middle of Central Texas.  I offered them 87,000, they came back and countered at 91,500.  I agreed.  So now I’m waiting on some paper signing and an inspection, but in my mind the deal is about halfway done and I need to start thinking about where to come up with my down payment.


I would prefer to put 20% down, but to do that, I would need to dip into retirement.  So here’s the main question – Do I get a 401(k) loan for the down payment and keep my cash and taxable account as a buffer/e-fund like I have been doing?  Or do I pull the money from contributions on the Roth IRA (seems like the worst option)?  Or do I work out some sort of personal line of credit and deplete most of my cash reserves?  Or do I just bite the bullet and pay PMI for a couple years while I build up 20% equity and refinance (when interest rates will probably have climbed?)


The NYT rent vs buy calculator says that if I stay for 2 years it makes sense to buy.  I will definitely be here for two more years, and I would prefer to get out of my overpriced lease, but keep the same location (this house lets me do both).  I would have no problem making payments on a 401(k) loan or even some type of personal line of credit, but my current cash situation makes a full 20% down payment difficult.

personalfinance,Calculating Ideal Down Payment and Mortgage Term,"I'm planning to be a first time home buyer in the next several months. 

I would like to maximize my return on investment over the next several decades. 

Anyone know how I would go about calculating the ideal down payment and mortgage term?


For example:

House cost: $250,000.

Real estate appreciation: 5% per year.

Cash return on investment: 8% per year. 


Scenario 1: 

$62,500 (25%) down payment

30 Year Mortgage: 3.754% APR

$868 / month payment


Scenario 2:

$62,500 (25%) down payment 

15 Year Mortgage: 3.004% APR

$1,295 / month payment

Other scenarios we could look at: 
A 15 year mortgage with 49% down payment raises mortgage rate to 3.104% APR, $880/month. A 30 year with 49% down payment raises it to 3.825% APR, $590/month. 


So if I do the 15 year mortgage I will get a lower interest rate, but I will be have less cash to invest. So the extra dollars I spend on mortgage payment I cannot invest and get and 8% rate of return. However, with a 15 year mortgage I will be done paying off the mortgage sooner, so in years 16-30 I can invest those dollars instead of paying the mortgage.

personalfinance,[Medical Student] Need a little help with my loans and future repayment,"So a little background. I'm in a 6-year program in which the first two years I am an undergraduate student, and then after that I become a graduate medical student for the next four. Tuition changes, but very slightly, so all-in-all, I'm looking at a lot of loans. 

&gt; 
&gt; So for my first two years:

&gt; University charged me: $77,000

&gt; Parents paid for me: $40,400

&gt; Navient Loan: $6,600 [3.86% interest--Stafford loan]-deferred

&gt; Myfedloan: $30,000 [6.16% interest--Parent plus?]-$400 due monthly

&gt; Wells Fargo: $15,000 [goofed and took this accidentally]-deferred
&gt; 

So my real goal is to get rid of the Myfedloan and the Wells Fargo. The Myfedloan is a burden on my parents and I want to get it deferred if possible, so I was thinking of taking another loan to pay it off, one that would be deferred. The Wells Fargo loan was a mistake because we messed up math and it got sent to us in a check that my dad invested. I'm calling them tomorrow to find out how to access my account and figure out the interest rate on that.

And then, starting this summer, I'm a graduate medical student. So I'm now eligible for graduate loans, including higher amounts. And this is where a lot of the confusion comes in. Of off AAMC's website, it says I'm limited to $40.5k annually, but my school will cost me $46k annually. At the same time, the next paragraph says I'm limited to $224k over my lifetime, so does that mean I'm expected to stay in medical school for 6 years? This confuses me greatly. My initial plan was to take this larger unsubsidized stafford loan so that I could repay the Myfedloan as well as the Wells Fargo loan, and my tuition (living expenses are not a factor). However, due to this annual limit, I don't know if I can.

The last thing is the rumors I've heard all my life about government will forgive my loans yada-yada. Basically it amounts to three things I've heard. I've done research and have found very little in the way of official sources, more just corroboration of rumors. 

1. If you do your residency in an underprivileged area, the government will take care of your loan.
2. If you have an 8 year residency and then pay 2 years of your loan at full monthly price, then the government will take care of the remaining based on some 10 years volunteer clause or something.
3. As part of a residency/doctor signing bonus, they pay off the remainder of my loan

Can anyone give me more information about any of these rumors, or point me to where I can find out the full story. 

Thanks a lot for your help and for reading this very long, messy post.",finance,1432748939
personalfinance,"Should I graduate early, and what would the implications be if I did so and took off for the Spring Semester before working?","Hello, 

I am currently a college student going into my senior year of college. To graduate early I would have to take 1 class this summer (a gen-ed at a community college for ~$750 total -- have contacted my advisor and just need the right forms in order to register for it -- 2nd summer session) and 18 credits in college in the Fall (6 business classes, I would be able to handle the coursework). 

College is about $19,000 a yr, so ~$9500 a semester. I currently have ~$50,000 in student loans - composed of $30,000 private, $17,000 fed unsubsidized and $3000 fed subsidized. 

I'm currently in an internship where around the end of the summer I should end up with around $8000 total in my bank account, so I plan on spending about $5-$6k of that into my fall tuition (and take out loans for the rest). This would leave 2-3k for rent and expenses, and if I get super low my parents can help a little bit. 

In the Spring semester I would be able to finish a minor - take interesting classes, and possibly get certificates, but after thinking about it I have realized that it is not worth $9500 to do it, as I would have to take out loans again.

However, I'm not sure that I would want to go straight to work in January. I'm thinking maybe I'd take some of the money I have ""saved"" (i.e. not spent) by not going to school in the Spring and taking a trip or something before going into the job force. 

Another thing to note is that while I can handle 6 courses in the fall, I would also be job searching because while the internship I have now would pay well I don't really think I want to work at that place. I do believe that I should be able to get a job that pays &gt;$60,000/yr and hopefully more than that due to my good academic standing and experience along with some connections I have made.

Also, would the companies start harassing me to pay back the loans?

personalfinance,Finally ready to pay off some loans! Which should I pay off first?,"I want to pay off one of my loans (car loan or student loan). Right now I have about $11k saved up.

I would like to save around $5k of that for an emergency fund.

Here is a summary of the loans:
	       Total Balance 	  Interest	     Monthly Payment
Car Loan	    $5,950 	          ~4.5%	                $385 
DOE Loan	    $6,900 	          ~5.5%	                $120 
Federal Loan  $5,400 	          ~6.0%	                $140 

I know that the student loans have a higher interest rate, but I feel I should pay off the remaining balance of the car first because:
1. It has a much higher monthly payment
2. I can use some of that car payment to increase my student loan monthly payments
2. In case I lose my job, I have the option to delay my student loan payments unlike my car.

Bitcoin,Legality Question,"I'm not 100% sure if this question should go here or in r/personalfinance. 

After seeing a thread yesterday about banking interest rates in other countries, I came up with a plan for all my future savings, but i need to know of any legal issues with my plan. 

I'd like to open an online savings account with Bank of New Zealand and take advantage of the 3.9% interest rate. In order to avoid exorbitant exchange rate fees I'd like to open the account with a small amount of money, and in the future convert all my money using bitcoin. My main question is if this would be considered money laundering. I am more than willing to pay my taxes on this money and interest every year, I am not trying to hide my money from the government. I just want to make sure that this process is legal, and if there are any precautions I should take during this process to protect myself. 

(I decided on New Zealand because while certain countries like India can offer much higher interest rates, their currency is more volatile, leaving more of a chance of me losing more money than I gain in the process. Any advice on other stable currencies with high rates is appreciated as well.)

personalfinance,(UK) Buying a house in London?,"Hopefully I won't make a fool out of myself by saying something completely ridiculous, but please bear with me.

My family owns some property in Italy, where house prices have been going down the drain. Luckily, the area where the properties are situated have been holding relatively well, though we are quite confident that it is not going to last for long.

This year, I have moved to London for my Masters degree and have got to know the real estate market around here. It is completely different from the Italian market, with house prices increasing even by 20% year-on-year, not to mention the fact that, rather than the landlord being the slave/personal handyman for the renter, it is the renter that is treated like shit around here (I'm living it first hand).

On top of that, given how expensive rent is in the capital, and knowing that a mortgage would actually be cheaper than rent, I was wondering if it would make sense for me and my family to buy a house around here, possibly selling off some property in Italy for the downpayment? I believe this would be a profitable use of money that otherwise would probably be burned by a fall in the value of the property it's currently tied to. I think the ideal price of the house would fall in the £200k-£400k ball park.

- leasehold: why is it that you buy a LEASE in London? If I'm paying, say, £200k for a flat, does that mean that me or my son or my grandson will have to pay another £200k in x years? No one explains this decently enough anywhere and it's confusing me a lot...
- **is it likely that house prices will start falling on us during the duration of the lease?** I don't believe this to be the case, since the London housing market appears to be a very poorly regulated market rather than a bubble, but still?
- the mortgage: how much (%) would you recommend putting in as a downpayment (i.e. is there an approximate percentage that optimises profit in the lower interest rate-more money upfront trade-off?); is it more convenient to buy-to-let or buy to live there myself?; would you recommend collateralising some remaining property on top of the downpayment and the house itself (i.e. would that make financial sense given the London real estate market outlook and future prospects)?

I just had a few questions about financial aid and college. I currently live in Alabama and am wanting to attend a small community college in Tennessee for a year to qualify for in-state tuition and transfer to a larger university. It is important that I go to TN because of the specific fields that this particular university offers.

One thing that I am wondering is if I decide to take a year off, move up to TN and work, then qualify for in-state tuition, would taking the year off effect my ability to be awarded a federal grant such as the Pell Grant?

Follow up to that question. On the FAFSA the majority of what you receive, aid wise, is based on the ability of your parents to help with your college and living expenses. Say that my parents do not claim me on there taxes, and I claim myself as an independent the next tax year, will that help me with that I will be awarded? 

I just am trying to figure out the best way to avoid student loans, because if I can get a good chunk of money from the Pell Grant, it would greatly reduce my tuition cost.

personalfinance,Should I accept or appeal a surprising property valuation?,"We bought our house, located in a bustling market, in 2013 for $275,500, with a 30 year conventional mortgage at 4.5%.  In March of this year our mortgage company, a large, mostly web-based organization, cold-called us saying that we were candidates for a refinance depending on how the numbers looked.  When asked what we thought the value of the house was, I said $290k, which I think is conservative for this market.  Weeks later the deal fell apart when the appraiser reported the house's value at $280k - we could have gone forward, but would have only saved about $10/month and we'd have added two years back on to the mortgage.

Fast forward two months - we get a postcard from the county assessor's office stating that our current year assessed value is *$328,800*.

As I see it we have two options...  We could appeal the valuation based on a two month-old appraisal, which would reduce our tax burden.  Or, we could let the valuation stand and use that in the near future to pursue another refinance while interest rates remain low.

If I had to bet, I'd guess that we've got nearly 0% chance of using tax valuation as a justification to override an appraisal with a bank, and will in the long run be better served by reducing our tax burden.  However, the wife was highly encouraged by seeing that large valuation, and is lobbying to go back to the bank.

I have EXTREME anxiety because of it (Even typing this makes me shake, so please please please don't drive home my idiocy). If I knew then what I know now, I never would have gone to college. Like countless others, I feel like I should just kill myself because there is no point in trying to make things work. [It comes and goes, I'm not seriously suicidal.] Alas, here I am, and thankfully it's just money. (Right?) I don't know where to begin, so I'm hoping there's some solace here. I don't know how to keep this short and still to the point, but here's what I've got:

Come July, I will be moving to Japan to teach English. I hear income is about $27,000 a year, how much I take home depends largely on other factors, none of which I know since I'm not even sure what prefecture (state) I'll be living in. I can't even begin to pretend to have a budget since I don't know anything at this point, other than I have a job, and I'm leaving the US on July 25th.

27, single, living at home- no car, no rent, no insurance, no real ""obligations"" other than student loans, food, and helping my mom out. Dad's dead, mom is disabled and out of work 8+ years. I've already sold about everything worth anything, and any current income is cashed and stashed for when I leave the country. Given my own and family situation, I have no co-signer, and I do not want a co-signer. No one is an option to borrow money from.

Recent grad after 10 years of an ""adventurous"" life in college, $67,000 in private loans, $67,000 in federal loans, stopped paying about $20,000 in CC debt about 2-3 years ago. Don't make enough money to be garnished (but, I make too much for food stamps). Defaulted on one private loan last year October, not sure where it is now. A few of my loans are changing servicers as time goes on, some are in deferment, some have been in repayment for the last 4 years. I would like to consolidate to get better rates, as well as have two payments instead of 7+, especially since this will be a complicated process that involves me wiring money back to the states. 

Currently, I work one job that pays about $11 an hour, 20-ish hours a week. I don't really have much leftover as it is, and what I do have is going straight to my overseas fund. Currently, I'm paying $216 a month interest only to Sallie Mae/Navient on $28,000 (which will jump to an unknown amount in July), about $200 a month to AES on two loans that are $17,000. Uncle Sam estimated $740 a month for my federal loans when I did my exit survey.

Has anyone had experience with consolidating loans and paying from overseas? What's my best option for trying to tackle all of this? I don't really have anything to start with, so I'm not sure where to even begin. I don't want to just stop paying my loans like I did my CC, but when I'm getting estimates that are close to $1200 a month, I just laugh because that's impossible. If they were reasonable amounts I'd be fine, but I defaulted on that one loan because I opted to go grocery shopping instead of paying my loans. I find the system to be a joke, but I still want to put forth the effort to at least work with it.

personalfinance,"Goin to school, projected 80k debt without scholarships/grants. Can I start paying what I owe the school now?","Howdy. Going to a great school for a pretty penny price. Sucks. I'm looking at 40k in federal loans, and the rest I have been chipping away at with scholarships, grants, and once fall of senior year hits, cover whatever rest with a private loan.

 The school is aware I can't take out loans due to an egregious identity theft debt on my name (that I still haven't gotten clear; I've sent a ton of paperwork to those companies and *NOTHING*) so its just debt owed to them that is accruing absolutely no interest.

I get a stipend from my dad per my mom and dad's divorce agreement. ""Pay child support to child when they turn 18 until child finishes four year college"" so I'm getting 5.8k a year, min from him. Great guy, he's helped me like you wouldn't believe. I recently quit my (shit) $100/wk job and took on a commission or two so that I can float 'till I get a new job. That's just a quick snapshot of my kind of income.

I've got several promising interviews to places that'll earn me roughly 1000 a month and another roughly 1200 a month (I want to work fulltime during the summer) and then working a solid 20/week at the 1200/month job should I get it. I'll be using all extra money to shove into a savings account. 

My question is that when i'm making money so that I can cover all my bills without my dad's contribution, can I start sending that 400/450 to the school this fall to minimize the private loan I'll have to take out on my financial exit interview? Is that a good idea, do you think? 

All of my bills/budget amount to ~400 and the rest of my money will be dutifully in a savings account. I get a tax return soon and I'm paying off my credit card with it and then shredding the card to not use it, and then using my lower interest cc for grocery or gas and paying it off fully every month (up to limit of 50 dollars) so as to continue building my credit. Last I checked it was 700-720. 

I guess I'm asking permission in a weird way to start paying off loan debt interest free, if its a good idea. I heard somewhere that student loand debt is good, but I don't want to grad with 80k when my starting job is 60k. Much rather grad with 60k or even less (These scholarships are freaking hard to get)

personalfinance,"It's my birthday, time to look back on my first year handling my finances","Hey guys,

Graduated college this time last year and took control of my finances for the first time in my life basically.  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

In this time I have done things that some people would say are out of order and I would partially agree as well, but I'm living and learning from that as well.    
  &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

*Unfortunately I graduated with over 27k in federal student loans, but have paid 3.3k in the past 10 months (with over half of that being in the last two months.. I know a little too late, but better late than never)  
&amp;nbsp;

  
*I built up a 1k emergency fund in a high yield debit/check access money market account which I add a bit more to every month
  &amp;nbsp;

  
*I bought a new 99 Ford Crown Victoria that is in excellent shape with only 93k miles with CASH.  
&amp;nbsp;

*I paid cash for all of my medical school interviews, suits, hotels, etc (few thousand dollars)
  &amp;nbsp;

  &amp;nbsp;

*I have also put 3k into my Roth (this is the part that I think I did a bit backwards.. I should have been putting this on my loans, which I am doing now.  Some of my loans are above 6%, so I figure part of the money I have put into my Roth could be well spent since some of my loans are as low as in the 3s)
    &amp;nbsp;

  &amp;nbsp;

  
Most importantly, I have greatly changed my views on money.  I literally have never done a budget until recently.  I grew up in a household where you just spent money until you were out and then you winged it until the next payday.  I NEVER heard my parents say ""We can't buy/do that because it's not in the budget"".  If we (as a family) wanted to eat out, we ate out.  If we wanted to go on vacation, we went.  House was refinanced multiple times to pay off debt (which isn't always a bad thing, but I don't necessarily think my parents were looking at the cost benefit analysis... just the immediate benefit analysis), they have pulled out of retirement accounts, my mom took out extra Parent PLUS loans while I was in school to help her get by (she makes upper 5 figures, she definitely didn't NEED it), etc.  
  &amp;nbsp;

  &amp;nbsp;

I just never had any good financial role models, and looking back on this last year really makes me smile and know that some day I am going to be in such a glorious position to be able to give so generously to my kids/wife (if applicable) and my local church and other charities.  It just truly makes me so happy that I have started on this journey because I no longer want to live letting my money control me. 
&amp;nbsp;

So my biggest motivator is seeing this line move up and up and up in regards to how much student loan I have paid:

gaming,My horrible experience with Sony support and how I lost my PLaystation 4 for 2 months,"Hey guys, if you're considering getting a Ps4, make sure you get a warranty with some other company like Gamestop or Walmart because you do NOT want to deal with Sony support.

I was unlucky, I got a Playstation that had some MFG problems (overheating when in an isolated, raised location) which is what it is, no need to get worked up about it. I call support, ask the procedures. They send me a box (3-5 business days) I send it back (3-5 business days) They fix it (7-10 business days) and ship is back (3-5 business days). In total, that's 16-25 business days (no weekends). It usually winds up being real time of 3-4 weeks. For reference my first sony support email came March 22nd.

After the first round of Ps4 surgery the worst happened...My Ps4 started overheating a second time in the exact same way as the first. So I call Sony support thinking ""There must be a way around this horrible warehouse deal right? This is the second time their machine has crapped out in a month"". 

Boy how wrong I was. I called tech support, let them know I was upset with the situation and was wondering if there was any way to expedite the process. Maybe a console exchange with a hold on my card (you send me a working system I send you a broken one) but they got scammed doing that before so no dice. Maybe a quick exchange? Tell the Warehouse it's busted again and just send me a refurb straight away for the inconvenience? Not a chance. **I even had one tech support guy say that if I wasn't pleased with Sony support I should do buy an Xbox!!!**

Flustered, I await my new box to ship the system back in. I get the box, tear away the shipping label to reveal my return label and... My return label tears &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232; I call support and ask them to email me a new sticker, no biggie right? YES BIGGIE. Sony must now send me a NEW box (takes 3-5 business days, got the first box on a Friday, so this is another week max).

It is now 2 months and 6 days after my first dealing with Sony and I and scheduled to receive it TODAY (unless FedEx makes another mistake...but this isn't about them!) and I'm as pissed as I can be. I'm a long time Sony supporter but this process has been slow, agonizing, and they're completely unwilling to expedite a process for someone who is having MFG issues twice on a console. Did I mention they **won't refund my PSN time?** because they won't. 2 months  of PSN gone and nothing I can do about it...

Come on Sony...

**TL;DR: Ps4 overheats. Cry and send in cosole for 1 month. Ps4 comes back and does it again. Wait over a month this time, no exchange system in place. Can't email a shipping Label. 2 Months have gone by and I don't have my console. WONT REFUND 2 MONTHS OF PSN**

personalfinance,"Starting to seriously try and save my money, and I'm overwhelmed and confused about what options would be the best.","I recently became a permanent resident of the US, and I'm trying to set myself up so that I have a decent financial safety net. However, I'm only 22, so I don't have a whole lot of knowledge.

I currently have a DDA, a Savings (~$1,500) and an MMA ($4,100). My DDA and Savings are with the same bank, while my MMA is at a separate bank.

I also have an account still open in Australia, which has a balance of about $2,700. My interest rate there is currently at 2.00%. I don't really know what to do with this money, as sometimes I transfer money to my mother's account, whenever she desperately needs to borrow money. Though this doesn't happen often.

I did work in Australia, and had superannuation, though I have no idea how much it is. I doubt there's a whole lot, since I only worked a few years before coming to America. I have no idea what my options are for that money.

My Savings account doesn't have a very good interest rate, so I've moved most of my money into the MMA, which has a 0.75% APR/APY currently. I want to make sure I keep some money in my Savings though, since I pay the bills out of my DDA, and want to be able to transfer money quickly between accounts. 

I want to make sure I'm getting the most out of my money, but I also don't want to do anything that has a risk with it, such as stocks/investments. However, I'm not knowledgeable on these subjects, so I don't know exactly how they work. I also considered a CD, but I don't know if I want to have my money tied up for years at a time. If anything were to suddenly happen where I needed money immediately, I wouldn't want to have money I couldn't access.

Additional info: My pay cheque is around $380 a fortnight (part time), and I usually pay about $300 in bills per month. I have 4 major credit cards, though I only really use 3 of them. I have good credit. No mortgage/rent or car payments. I am married, but I don't want to include my husbands funds, as I'm trying to be as independent as possible with my savings. My husband is on my Savings and MMA account. My employer has 401(k), and will match up to 4% of my contributions, though that hasn't started yet. Also, if I contribute 4% of my pay, but it doesn't equal $2,000 they will contribute the difference.

So, should I keep doing what I'm doing? Is there a better way to save my money for the mid to long term? Should I leave my money in Australia where it is? Also as an aside, do I have to declare that money for my taxes in the US?",finance,1432822515
personalfinance,Starting my Master's Degree Education,"I will begin a two year, four semester long education in New York City. My biggest concern is how to use the money I have and when to use a loan.

My savings: $30,000.00  
Help from family: $30,000.00  
Tuition Fall 2015: $18,145.50  
Tuition Winter 2016: $18.481.50  
2016-2017 Tuition will probably be roughly the same.  

I have been offered a Federal Direct Loan (Unsub) for $20,500.00 to be split over the two semesters.  

Currently, I am unaware of any scholarships or fellowships being awarded to me. Work study offers $400-$600 waived tuition for 40-60 hours of work a semester.   

Living situation: I will be living rent free but will have to pay for general expenses like utilities, cell phone, health insurance, transportation, and food, which I'm rounding up to be about $500/month.  

I will definitely be finding work, probably part time, hopefully around $15-$25 an hour. During the summer I will be busting my ass to make money.   

My biggest question is, should I avoid taking out loans the first year if I have the means? I'm hoping that by the second year I will earn merit scholarships that will lower my tuition, therefore less likely to take a big loan out my second year.   

My other question is, $30,000.00 is basically all the money I have. I am selling my car for $5,500-$6,500. These being my personal assets, how much money should I spend on school, and how much to keep for emergency and padding.   

Right now, with tuition at full price for two years, if I want to spread my funds evenly, I could take out about $6,000-$7,000 in loans per semester without knowledge of any scholarships I may receive.   

The Future: Median salary of a photographer in New York City is $66,000 - $76,000. I plan on continuing my career in New York, and will probably be able to live rent free if I need the help but I don't want to depend on that. I will also like to pay back my family at least half of what they have offered to help me, around $15,000. I already have many connections in the art world (established artists, art institutions, and galleries), therefore job leads, that are in New York. Trying to give perspective for anyone who can help me. I know a lot of people move to New York in the hopes to be an artist. Art is my passion, being an artist will always be part of me but I am definitely open to career options that lead me to working in an institution or part of a city program or education.

personalfinance,Immediately pursue MBA or defer grad school for a year?,"Hey all,

Long time lurker and subscriber, first time posting.  I'm an undergrad about to enter his final semester this Fall, and recently discovered that I have the option to defer my grad school start until one year from when I graduate.

More context -- my school has a program that allows undergrads to declare their intent to enter graduate school and if a certain GPA is maintained, automatic acceptance w/out testing is guranteed.  I am on track to graduate with all conditions met and have decided to pursue a 13-course MBA degree which should consist of about a year to a year-and-a-half's studies.  My undergraduate degree will be in Accounting.

To make the story shorter, I am also able to take two graduate courses this Fall while completing my remaining three for my undergrad degree, reducing the amount of courses to 11 for my MBA.

I recently found out that upon officially completing the application for graduate school (I will be required to do this by September), that I may defer the official start of my graduate studies for up to one year.  My two options essentially are to immediate pursue the MBA in Spring 2016 or defer and wait another year to begin.

I currently have an internship and guarantee that an offer for a full time position will be made.  I do not know what salary I would be making, and my employer does not know about my MBA intentions as of now.

I stand at approx. $37,000 in federal student loan debt, before graduate school.  The total cost of the MBA is approx. $55,000.  I am fortunate enough to receive undergraduate grants of $38,500 annually and my family fronts the rest of the bill.  I do not know how much in grant money I would continue to receive for grad school (there is need-based aid available).  The maximum federal aid available for graduate school in the form of unsubsidized Stafford loans is $20,500 annually.  For conservative purposes, I assume that I will be taking on the entirety of this debt to fund my MBA degree.  However, depending on how much/how little aid I receive will certainly be a significant factor in how much additional debt I would be taking on.

By taking a year off and working for the company I am interning at full-time, I could live at home and save as much as I can to pay down the undergrad debt PRIOR to beginning grad school.

The salary I would be receiving is purely an estimate, but the budget is conservative and expenses are consistent with what I am currently spending.  Moreover, I do not anticipate much of a change in lifestyle since I would be living at home and have much of my food expense provided by my parents.

Here's a financial breakdown:

**Option A - no deferment**

* Current Debts $37,070 
* Anticipated Future Debts 		
* Final Undergrad Semester 2,750 	
* Graduate School 20,500 	  
* Total Debts 60,320 
		
* **Estimated Monthly Payments $580**

**Option B - Deferment**

* Current Debts $37,070 
* Anticipated Future Debts 		
* Final Undergrad Semester 2,750 
* Graduate School - (deferred)
* Anticipated Savings from Gap Year 27,744 (based on gross income of 50,000)
* Debts Prior to Graduate School 12,076 
* Add: Anticipated Grad. Debt 20,500 
* Total Debts $32,576 
		 
* **Estimated Monthly Payment $346**

As you can see, my estimated payments would be greatly reduced, as would my total debt owed.  Calculations were performed via the Estimated Repayment calculator at studentloans.gov and the deferment option did not take into account the likely increase in salary due to having an MBA.

My parents are pushing for me to continue with school and to ""get it done,"" but I wanted to consider my options.  The possibility of reducing my debt significantly is enticing to say the least.  What say you PF?",finance,1432835443

&amp;nbsp;

I will be attending a law school starting this fall (before you suggest that I do not attend law school, I have enough experience in this field of work and am firm in this decision :)  )! Thanks to scholarships and my parents footing half of the remaining payments, I would only be in debt for $51,000 (not considering any accumulated interest payments). 

&amp;nbsp;

My question is, how should I finance this loan? There are three options available to me right now:

&amp;nbsp;

1) Use Grad PLUS loan, which comes with a 7.21% interest rate. Not too great of an option.

&amp;nbsp;

2) Use Unsubsidized Stafford loan at 6.81 (?)% interest rate. Much better than option 1, but I am hoping there could be options better than this one. 

&amp;nbsp;

3) Ask my parents to take out the remaining 51k from their bank loan (backed by their house, interest rate fixed at 4.0%). Best option so far financially, but I hate burdening my parents further and I strongly desire to get a loan in my name so that I feel much more responsible for the payments.

&amp;nbsp;

Reddit, what should I do? Do you know of any private loan options better than options 1 and 2? (option 3 is nominal; in reality, it is most likely the last option I would take unless the accumulated interest payments between option 3 and my choice would differ by more than 10k.)

I recently received my first full time job with benefits and all that jazz. I’ll be working in the IT field, starting at the bottom of the pyramid on June 1st.



As this is my first real job and I still have debt and what not from school, I was wondering if you all had some advice.



I’ll be making about 40k. I make about 3k with my side business (could be more, could be less).

My wife goes to school and works part time. I figure she’ll make 6-7k.

So, together we’ll make about **50k**.

I also have about **15k** in the stock market that I would like to keep there. As bad as debt is, I make more money with that in stocks than I would taking it out to pay off the loans and shit. This is just here for some wiggle room and to add another variable for you guys.

We have about **10k** in savings right now.



My wife and I rent an apartment for about 850/ month + 30 internet + 20ish electric = 900/month

The job offers insurance, which I will be taking about 120/month.

I pay 150/ month for student loans (about 7k left) – they are a few different loans with varying interest rates. One is 3k at 4.5%, the other is 1k at 6.5%, the next is about 2.5k at 4.5%

125/month for car (about 6k left) 1.99%

Wife car is about 150/ month (6kish left)

Car insurance about 100/month

Total of **1500/month** - roughly




She will be in her last semester and tuition for the whole year will be 12k… I’m not 100% sure what she’ll get for student loans and/or grants.



I’m not 100% sure on taxes, but I figure a good estimate would be about 35%.



So our take home would be: 32500… lets round down to **30,000** for simplicity.



My company will match 50% of what I put into my 401k up to 6,000. So if I put 12,000 they’ll match with 6,000, but not anymore.



My question is, what are my first steps here? Should I put 12k in the 401k? Should I pay more for my student loans 
and get rid of those? Should I pay my car off? This is the first time I’ll ever have steady money like this coming in and there are some big decisions to be made that will impact my future, so I’m just looking for some general, solid advice from people. Ultimately it will have to be my choice, but hearing from other people doesn’t hurt.



If I forgot some useful information, let me know and I'll do my best to include it.

personalfinance,Use 401k to pay off remaining mortgage?,"Hi all,

I am contemplating using my current 401k saved money to pay off my mortgage. The balances are about the same now. I am 40, mrtg left 300k, 401k is 320k

I get 6% company match for every $ and would keep contributing 6%. Sure you take a hit taking the 401k money now (10%?) it now, but is there sanity in the plan to use 401k to effectively be done with paying mortgage?

How much higher can the stock market really go? There is no more will for another QE, rates are going to rise eventually, I think we're going to be like Japan and move sideways for years to come.

How much upside do I really have on my 401k (which has done quite nicely over the last 6 years due to the FED pumping the markets)

Mortgage is 3.75%. So by paying it off early I will not be paying $498,775.49 (300k + interest)  but just the 300k! That's 200k 'saved'!

I'd basically have my house as retirement. I could downscale and sell and use that to live on.

personalfinance,Looking for a lot of help digging myself out of a very deep hole.,"Here is my situation. I've made a lot of financial mistakes (not all my ""fault"", I'll explain later).

My Credit score has fallen below 500 and is making life very difficult.

I have a lot of accounts in collections on past cell phone carriers that I switched between from ages 20-24. I also have an unpaid credit card balance.

My biggest issue is my student loan debt. I have nearly $90k in student loan debt with loans across different banks. Sallie Mae, Wells Fargo, and federal loans. The payments are impossible to keep up with even with my $40k/yr income with $800 bi-weekly checks (before garnishment) and an average $400 commission check at the end of each month. I have 6 private loans and another 5 federal via Sallie Mae (now known as Navient) which they refuse to consolidate and the payments they want exceed $600 and they won't budge. Wells Fargo loan is only about $5k and has a very flexible payment plan. Federal loans are currently in default status simply because I could not keep up. I get multiple phone calls every day from the loan companies and debt collectors and a mailbox full of collection letters. It's a nightmare.

To make it even worse, I never graduated so that was money well-spent :(

To compound these issues even more, I have a spending problem due to a mental health issue I have. I have borderline personality disorder and it can and does cause a lot of uncontrollable spending. For example, I'll get depressed and then I'll go out and spend money on frivolous things to make myself feel better, feel bad about spending the money, and then go out to spend more money to feel better about feeling guilty about spending money. It's a vicious cycle.

My rent is $400/mo.
Car Insurance: $150/mo.
Home Internet: $60/mo.

I have a lot of medical bills, A LOT. I have several different medical issues that put me in the hospital several times a year. I tend to hit my out-of-pocket pretty early on in the year. I'm a type 1 diabetic that has to buy a lot of supplies and insulin and the costs are quite overwhelming ($400/mo. just for the insulin).

I'm trying to get myself out of the gutter, but am finding it near impossible with everything falling down on me at once.

**Edit**: Some of my income and student loan information:

**Monthly Average Income: $1,600/mo.**
 * Wages being garnished at 15% per check due to Federal loans in default.

**Private Loans - Temporary 1% interest payment option.**

* $20,212.42
* $7,991.98
* $5,892.85
* $11,916.94
* $19,384.73
* $9,288.88

**Total: $75,187.80**

**Payment Per Month: $262**

**Edit** My father is currently making these payments as he is the one who cosigned for them. It really helps that he's doing this, but I would really like to take responsibility for this.

**Federal Stafford via Navient(Sallie Mae)**

* $2,898.02 - 2.33% - $600.82 past due
* $1,420.48 - 6.8%  - $169.17 past due
* $3,003.39 - 6.8%  - $357.59 past due
* $1,475.13 - 6.8%  - $175.69 past due
* $5,688.20 - 6.8%  - $677.31 past due

**Currently $1,980.58 past due.**

**Total: $14,485**

**Active Debts in Collections (Transunion, Equifax, Experian reporting)**

* AT&amp;T - $752.00

**Other Monthly Recurring Payments**

* Home Internet - $45.00/mo.
* Entertainment - $15.00/mo. (Hulu and Netflix)
* Rent - $400.00/mo. (Includes my share of utilities)
* Car Insurance - $177.00/mo. (really need to find a cheaper option, I also have to postpone payments sometimes, so every so often it's $192 due to stupid late payment fees)

**Goals**:

I really want to find ways to get my student loan debt under control and get my credit score up. I would like to at least be able to get it good enough to start renting a place on my own (get denied everywhere I go) and get some sort of line of credit going.

I also want to work on a budget that I can stick with to ease some of the financial stress and back on my feet.

I would also LOVE to go back to school and finish my degree. I made the huge mistake of going to a for-profit school (Art Institutes, big mistake...) which is lacking a lot of accreditation which makes it virtually impossible to transfer the credits anywhere else.

**Edit 2**

I have recently started up a 401k with a 10% contribution from each paycheck.

**Edit 3**

Still trying to get all the info from Wells Fargo, but call times are in excess of 20 minutes and I don't have that kind of time during their business hours. To make it even more stupid, my password for looking at it online was reset and you need to call them to get the password reset.

I also took a look at my credit report from the three major reporting companies and it looks like only AT&amp;T is in active collections. The other debts I had (credit card and T-Mobile) are older than 10 years and I believe they just fell off.",finance,1432845761
personalfinance,Help: Mother illegally claimed me as a dependent and dramatically increased my tuition costs.,"I'm an undergraduate student [21/f] entering my final year of college. My parents are divorced, and I live independently from both of them. I am estranged from my father and have had no financial connection to him since 2012. My mother pays for my medical expenses and monthly public transportation pass, which total to $100 per month. All of my other expenses -- tuition, rent, utilities, groceries, etc. -- are covered solely by myself. I work two jobs in the restaurant industry to pay my bills, so the vast majority of my income comes from tips. I typically earn $10-$15k per year, and my total monthly expenses amount to $800.

I have allowed my mother to claim me as a dependent on her taxes, because her tax break and extra refund was more helpful than hurtful to us both. But this year, unbeknownst to me, my mother received a large promotion and raise at work, and she claimed additional child support payments. This caused my FAFSA Expected Family Contribution to raise from $50 in 2014-2015 to $11,000 in 2015-2016. This renders me ineligible for state and federal grants I relied on every year prior (totaling to about $7,000) and raises my overall tuition cost for this year over $10,000 from last year. Regardless of these changes, my mother refuses to contribute to my tuition costs.

While I usually file my own taxes and allow my mother to claim me as a dependent, she went behind my back to a new accountant this year and filed for us both. She did this to hide her increased income and child support from me. I did not give her permission to do this, nor can she legally claim me as a dependent -- I haven't lived in her house in 3 years, and she provides much less than half my financial support. She also filled out my FAFSA, as she used the form to receive aid for her Master's program. Obviously, I'm upset at myself for assuming my mother was doing me a favor by taking care of this paperwork for us both.

I've been trying to handle this myself, and it's getting down to the wire. Financial aid awards will be distributed in two weeks, and my college aid advisor informed me of many of these issues just a few days ago. Is there any way to re-file my taxes individually to reflect my independency? What can I do about the FAFSA and tuition situation, if anything? Are there any emergency/last-minute scholarships or funds for students in situations like this? Thank you so much for your help.",finance,1432846873
personalfinance,Is owing the IRS better or worse than owing a credit union?,"My husband and I have a somewhat unique financial situation, and are in need of some advice. 

My husband is self-employed and has no taxes taken out of his paychecks. He makes anywhere from $100,000-$150,000 a year and is paid sporadically. In 2013, the first year of this work arrangement for him, we were blindsided and unprepared by the taxes we owed when the IRS sent us a bill for over $30,000. We set up a payment plan through the IRS, but it has a terrible 30% interest rate. We have been making a monthly payment of $1300 dollars a month since the summer of 2014, and are finally starting to see light at the end of the tunnel (roughly 6,000 left). 

So, in 2014 we were more prepared, but still owed 10,000 at the end of the year. Not a huge deal, but to avoid paying it all at once we were going to roll half of it into our installment agreement. However, we just found out today that the IRS never received our return. Somewhere between the Post Office and the IRS it was lost. So we have to re-file, and will likely be charged interest on the balance for the time between April and now. 

**Note** No one from the IRS told us they never got our return, and the check we sent at the same time as the return was processed. We had absolutely no way of knowing it didn't get there, it was just luck that I happened to call and inquire about the balance today. On other forums, people have reported not being notified for up to two years that the IRS was missing a return! Does anyone know anything about this in particular? Is there any way to fight the interest owed? We were told our Certified Mail receipt is useless, because it only shows we mailed an envelope and has no proof of the return actually being inside it. 

So, anyway, my ultimate question is if we would be better off at this point just taking out a personal loan from a credit union (probably at a lower interest rate, our cars were both financed at .9%, and we are both have above 750 credit scores) and paying the IRS in full? Is it better or worse to be in debt to the IRS or to a credit union? Any information anyone has about this would be so helpful. 

Other info: We have almost no other debt, no credit cards, no mortgage, one car loan with 5,000 remaining. I work as well, but I'm a substitute teacher and I make next to nothing. Every penny I have made in the last two years has gone into taxes. Our spending habits aren't necessarily out of control, and we live in a very high cost of living city. We are financially stable in virtually every other area, but we can't seem to disentangle from the IRS. 2015 is the year we finally save up to pay the full amount in April!",finance,1432850698

personalfinance,Variable Interest Rates vs. Fixed Interest Rates on student loans?,"Hello, long story short I am trying to figure out what is the best option for me in terms of finding a private loan to fund tuition. I need about 12k in loans to cover the rest and it looks like the two ""best"" options are Sallie Mae or a Parent Plus Loan. Sallie Mae has two choices for rate loans, being variable and fixed. The variable ones look tempting because they range from 6% to 7% but I know this could skyrocket at anytime depending on the market (But it could also drop). Their fixed rates are higher at 7.875% to 8.875% but I suppose these would stay the same throughout the entire loan duration. Now Parent Plus Loans have a fixed interest rate of about 7.210% which is pretty high but less than Sallie Mae's fixed rates. However, PLUS loans have a disbursement fee and are in my parent's names. Having read all that, could anyone who's been down this path offer me any advice as to what to choose? Sallie Mae's fixed options look tempting because they are only about ~1.5% higher than the Parent Plus Loans and they would be in my name after I get a job and release my parent as the cosigner but I have heard horror stories about using Sallie Mae. 
Any advice would be much appreciated please!",finance,1432853177

personalfinance,"Contributing to 401k, am I stretching too thin??","I just turned 29 and have been working a month at my first ""real"" job. I have not contributed to any retirement account before so I want to start saving aggressively and taking full advantage of everything my employer offers. Below is some pertinent information.


* My base salary is $58k
* Employer 401k matches 50% of the first 4% of base salary
* Employer stock options matches 100% of up to 3% base salary in company stock
* Employer will contribute a flat $500 per year into a HSA account should you choose to have one
* No car payment, student loans or any other debt
* Credit score ~800, credit cards paid in full every month


&amp;nbsp;


The shares from the stock options have no vesting period or any other stipulation on them. As soon as they clear and are in my account I can sell immediately if I choose to, including the employer matched shares. I am contributing the full 3% here. I have opened a HSA and after the employer contribution I am planning to have ~$1700 a year in it ($50 per paycheck, paid twice a month).


&amp;nbsp;


Currently I am setup for a 20% 401k contribution. No matter what I do I will well exceed the employer match so that won't be an issue. This is a contribution of $11,600 per year. I was considering higher but I think I would rather choose to max a Roth IRA instead of fund the 401k further.


&amp;nbsp;


I spent some time preparing a budget and running some numbers on take home pay based on 2015 tax rates for both federal and state. I made very liberal estimates for expenses to be sure to leave some wiggle room. I already have an emergency fund built up of approximately 6ish months. 


&amp;nbsp;


Also worthwhile to note is that I am actively looking for a new place to live and currently have budgeted $1200 but am hoping to come in well under that (live in southern California). My current living situation was just to get me to California and on my feet and I have been fortunate enough to have lived for free for the past couple of months.


&amp;nbsp;


Anyways, on to the meat of this. All in after taxes, contributions to everything, and all expenses including things like gas, miscellaneous entertainment and travel(budgeted per month for a couple trips a year) I currently estimate to be adding to be savings to the tune of $400 - $500 a month. In reality I think it would probably be more than that because of my conservative estimates of some expenses. My question is simply is this acceptable or am I spreading too thin here? I would need another $5500 is fund the Roth IRA which basically means that my personal savings account is not growing much at all for the year. Should I consider throttling back the 401k contribution in order to develop a bigger cushion?

personalfinance,Invest or Pay Student Loans with a Low Interest Rate,"My wife and I (35/31) have ~67k in student loans consolidated at 1.875% from her education.  We also have five children (1m-10y).  We have been on IBR since a bit after the inception of IBR (2008).  Prior to entering IBR, we were deferring payments.  I work as a teacher in California.  My wife does not work and this is a mutually agreeable arrangement.  We have had little to no required payments since we began IBR, however this will no longer be the case.  I am moving up the salary schedule and we will have to begin paying in the coming years, because we have the ability.

We are considering three options and are leaning towards one.

These models rely on several assumptions-
Tax laws remain similar to today.
The children remain tax dependents through age 22, the end of undergraduate education.
I continue teaching and the salary schedule doesn't change drastically.


1) The IBR route will have us paying ~$83k in monthly payments, ending in 2033.  The loan would end paid in full, not relying on any loan cancellation.  

2) If we don't rely on the IBR at all and pay $430 per month for 15 years we would end up paying ~$77k. 

3) If we put $430 per month into an index fund for 13 years, even assuming only 4% growth, we could pay for the student loan in a lump sum.  We would only pay the minimum required under the IBR program.  Over 13 years this would require ~$67k in contributions.


We are leaning towards option 3 because it looks like we would have the shortest repayment period and pay the least into the loan.  It would also be a significant hedge against disaster.

Is there something I am not considering?  Is option 3 reasonable?",finance,1432868805

investing,ELI5: How does one actually take advantage of a bond yield?,"Hi, r/investing,

I have a quick question: how does one actually go about taking advantage of a bond's yield. As I understand it, a bond has a principal value, let's say $100, which is paid to the investor at the maturation date (say, in a year). However, the buyer doesn't buy the bond for $100, he or she would buy it for less, let's say $95, and receive the $100  principal on the maturation date. 

Furthermore, there is a coupon, which is an specified interest rate which is fixed and paid on the initial investment quarterly (or annually for longer maturation dates). This coupon could be something like 2% which, when combined with the additional money in the principal, compensates the investor for the temporary loss of money.

Now, all of this is *different* from the yield on the bond as I understand. There are markets for bonds, and the prices of the bonds in these markets reflects inflation, the current interest rates of the bonds, and what we expect the future interest rates to be. 

Now, the yield of the bond is the effective interest rate of our bond that is encoded within the price in these markets. So, let's say I have a bond that has a coupon of 2%, and I see in some financial reports that the yield is 5%. How do I go about taking advantage of this supposed profit? Do I just sell my bond in these markets, and the price I sell it for will be the same *as if* I had a coupon of 5% and held it to maturity?

Note: this is for educational purposes only, I don't actually own any bonds.",finance,1432874617

cybersecurity,Start-ups companies need to care about security!!!,"Start-ups beware: Security is not just for established companies. One big data breach could cost you your business.
Big companies have been able to weather major data breaches, but young companies that aren't taking security seriously are at high risk of losing everything when they get hit with an attack, security industry pros. 
""You are never too small. If you have vulnerability and it gets exploited. It will bring a great deal of attention on you, and the smaller the start-up the more likely it is that a major incident will kill your company,"" said Sushant Nayak, Founder Chairman, Acura Consulting Company. 
So what should young companies be doing to protect themselves?
First, start-ups should have a plan in place for how they will deal with a breach, ""If you are not planning ahead you are going to have terrible, terrible legal problems,"" who defends companies that have been breached.
Forty-seven states have notification laws in place for breaches under certain circumstances, he said. Companies who have experienced a breach may be required legally to provide notice of the incident and if there isn't a proper plan in place they could land themselves in more legal trouble.
""Every company is going to have a security breach, there is no question about it.
""Just because you are an emerging company, there's no 'emerging company exception' to the federal laws and notification laws.""
Besides having a plan in place, companies should also constantly be monitoring what kind of information they are collecting about their users. 
""It's really important to know what data you are collecting, processing and storing and why. One of the best things you can do as a start-up business is be very, very selective of what information you collect and store,"" Sushant Nayak said. ""They can't steal what you don't have.""
Another thing companies should be doing is encrypting all their stored data, Sushant Nayak said. If data is encrypted and there is a breach, companies reduce their risk of information's being exposed, but there could still be legal implications.
""There are a number of states, though, that even if the data is encrypted, under the terms of the statute, you have to provide notice to the consumers and perhaps to the attorney general and that's the kind of thing that could spark an investigation,"" he further added.",technology,1432901913

personalfinance,Student loans burying me -- advice appreciated (PSLF discussion too),"I have read a few threads in here about public service loan forgiveness and how great it sounds...even though it really doesn't apply to that many people when all factors are considered (total loan amount, salary, where you work, etc etc).  
  
Here is my situation, in a nutshell:  
*Graduated with a doctorate degree (6 years total schooling requiring student loans)  
*Total student loans ~130k  
*Currently working federal government making in the 100-125k range.  
*Enrolled in the PSLF program which financially makes sense for me (I THINK)  
  
**ISSUE**: As most of you probably know, to be enrolled in PSLF you have to be under an ""Income based repayment plan"", where your minimum monthly payments are based on your income (they look at your tax info for the previous year). When I was doing residency my minimum payment was about $225 or so. Then after my first year out of residency my minimum payment jumped to $960/month. I felt this amount seemed high to be a ""minimum payment"" so I called a fedloan agent who said they probably would be able to lower my monthly payment if I resubmitted a new ""Income based repayment application""...so I did.  
  
Well now I find out my minimum monthly payment has jumped to $1560/month! My salary in the past year was raised less than 7%, so what gives?  If this trend continues how can anyone even afford to participate in the PSLF?  
  
Warning, rant incoming: I have no problem paying for the education I received. It was my choice to go through a rigourous schooling program that I knew would be at least 6 years long and would accrue me an excessive amount of debt, because I  knew it would result in a stable job for the rest of my career. What I **DO** have a problem with is the interest on my loans. OVER 6%! You want to make an impact on our country, you want to inspire our youth to pursue further education? Stop raping us for going to school.  
  
To put some (personal) perspective on this situation: In the past 6 months I have paid $6,000 towards my student loans. In this same time frame, the total amount due on my student loans (Principal+interest owed) has RISEN by $3,000. 
  
Another concern I have that I know has been discussed before...PSLF is a new program, one that has not had a ""graduating class"" yet as it was only started in 2007 (correct me if I am wrong). What is to say when it comes my time to be ""forgiven"", the program is still even around? If the program is canned any time in the next 7-8 years for me, I am so screwed from the interest I will have racked up in that time. It seriously overwhelms me to think about this.   
  
Sorry for the great wall of text, but would love for anyone to chime in. I know many others are facing similar situations so even if you do not have specific advice for me I would be grateful just to hear from you.

I am about to use a big portion of this to pay down my loans, but am nervous because I feel like I need a decent amount in case of emergencies.

personalfinance,Question about balance transfer,"I had a quick question about opening up a credit card for the sole purpose for a balance transfer.

personalfinance,"Another recent grad here -- 12k in Debt, could use some help!","I come from a very financially irresponsible home, and upon graduation am trying to make sure I don't make the mistakes my mother did. However, I haven't had the opportunity to see what real financial responsibility is like, or what are good habits to start up. I've read through all the FAQs and kind of have a rough idea, but want to make sure I'm approaching this in the right way. 

I have about $12,000 in federal student loans, both subsidized and unsubsidized. I will be working full-time (40 hrs/week) at a job paying $14.50/hr. I've calculated that after all my living expenses each month I should have around $600 extra. So do I put this into an emergency fund for the first few months, and then from there start to pay off my loans? Or do I split it up, putting some toward an emergency fund, and some toward my loans? Should I look into payment plans, or just accept the standard repayment plan provided? What about IRAs and such? I start work next week and will find out then what type of 401ks and such are offered by my employer. If they offer matching, should I withhold the maximum amount that they will match?

I'm wanting to pay this off as soon as possible, as it's my only debt. My boyfriend and I are planning to get married within the next couple years, and I would prefer to be able to start saving for that rather than paying off loans and interest. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: Ok, I was able to find more detailed information. I have two unsubsidized loans, each with 6.8% interest that is already accruing, one of $666, the other of $2000. The rest are subsidized loans at 3.4% interest that won't start accruing until December. I'm considering paying off the larger of the unsubsidized as quickly as possible, and then tackling the smaller one before then moving on to the subsidized.",finance,1432931803

personalfinance,"$500k in student loan debt, $300k mortgage... what would you do?","So I kind of don't have a trusty person who knows finance well to help me out so I figured I would post here and see simply, if you were in my shoes what would you do?

So I am a general dentist.  I'm 28 years old, I've been practicing for almost 3 years. I'll break down my total debts here:

* $500k student loans interest rates varying from 3.4-7.9% (rates are fixed though)
* $300k mortgage w/interest rate 4.2%
* $20k car loan interest rate 5.9%

* No credit card debt.

**This next section is pretty dry and it details my student loan situation so skip through if you are bored already:**
I have about $120k in private loans that have a relatively low interest rate around 3.4%.  Not much flexability there.  I have about $370k in federal student loans.  All of which I am paying under the Income Based Repayment program.  Basically I submit my gross income every year and they calculate how much I pay.  Last year I was paying about $800 a month, this year it will be about $1200 a month.  After 20 years under this program the remainder of the balance will be forgiven and that remainder I will have to pay taxes on (which could be $50k in taxes? who knows).  

There is an alternative where I could enter the ""Pay As You Earn Plan"" which lowers the monthly payment and drops the forgiveness date to 15 years, but stay with me, I have to pay off about $20k in one certain loan before I could apply for that program if I want to.

**Ok you can start reading again**
My income is very tough to gauge, I get paid completely on production (almost like sales), last year was around $120k gross,  I should be around $160-180k this year.  In theory my income should continue to increase, but again tough to really tell.

I do rent out a room in my condo for around $1100 a month, so I get an extra $13200 a year from that.  

Right now I am paying about $5k a month for all of my student loans and mortgage and miscellaneous bills.

I have about $20k in the bank (some of which inevitably will be paid towards taxes).  I have no other investments.

So... if you're in my shoes, how would you handle this situation?  Should I continue to take advantage of the income driven options for the majority of my student loans and take my chances on a big tax bill in 15-20 years?  Or should I try to attempt to pay them off and have the next 5-10 years of my life suck?",finance,1432938274
personalfinance,Student Loans/Life Balance,"I'm using a throwaway because I'm very private about my financials. 

Sorry for the long post, but this stuff has been stressing me out lately.

I've used the resources in the sidebar to develop my rough repayment strategy below:

**Loans**

* Parent Plus loan: $33, 328 @  7.9%
* Parent Plus loan: $1, 021 @ 6.4%
* Direct Subsidized loan: $10, 000 @ 3.4%
* Direct Subsidized loan: $7, 500 @ 4.6%
* Direct Subsidized loan: $5, 500 @ 3.9%
* Direct Unsubsidized loan: $7, 421 @ 6.8%
* Direct Unsubsidized loan: $2, 115 @ 3.9%
* Federal Perkins loan: $14, 168 @ 5.0%

**total**: $80, 983 @ ~ 6.0% (according to studentloans.gov)

My plan is to tackle the parent plus loans first because they do not have a grace period (collecting interest now) and because they have the highest interest rate. I'll have to make minimum payments on the other loans once the grace periods for those expire (I think 6 months).

I'm living in Southern California, and I'll be starting my job in July. 

Annual salary is $71, 500 and my bills include

* rent + utilities: $900 (I have 2 other roommates)

I would love any advice on repayment methods, but the reason why I chose to make a thread was to get some advice on balancing repayment and enjoying life. Let me clarify:

I know debt isn't good, but I feel like your 20's should be a fun time and I don't want to spend most of it broke/not being able to do anything. 

My original goal was to be debt-free in about 5 years, but that would require some hefty payments (i.e. no money for me). If I follow this route, I'm afraid that I'll look back and regret not extending my loan repayment time in order to enjoy myself more while I was in my 20s. Furthermore, if something bad were to happen to me the day I paid off my loans, then I don't think I would have lived a fulfilling and meaningful life. I would have just spent the majority of my time working and paying off these loans.

At the end of the day I guess it comes down to people's preferences and how negatively debt affects them, but I was hoping to maybe get some perspective from people who have been in this situation before.

financialindependence,Lessons learned about tax lien investing,"I posted a question earlier about tax lien investing. I have since done some research. Basically, it's not that great.

In my state (Colorado), you will earn an interest rate of 10% on the tax lien. At auction, you'll bid a premium somewhere from 0 to 10%. If the homeowner paid the lien the next day, you would lose that premium.

The amounts are small (some just a few hundred dollars) but commercial liens could be quite alot. If you are bidding on small loans, I'm not sure how all the work to service the lien is worthwhile. Say you had a $1000 lien and it costs you $50 to check out a property. That means that you lose -5% with that cost.

Given the uncertainty of the cash flows, it's nearly impossible to do a proper valuation. I'm sure most investors just do seat-of-the-pants calculations.

Now, the sexy part of these investments is foreclosing on the properties. However, this happens very rarely. I've been researching the properties that go this route and they are really crappy. Seriously. One lot was full of mining debris. Another was on a steep north facing and covered in snow (today!). 

Others were in this amazingly poor land subdivision. Some of these roads were not safe for my car; you would need a 4x4.

personalfinance,In a pretty deep hole...need advice,"So my wife and I are getting buried in credit card debt. I thought we were too smart to get caught up in it, but life happened. We're stuck in a cycle now where we put groceries/essentials on credit and have no emergency fund. After having an unexpected medical issue last week, we started really scrutinizing our budget for the first time in a while. Turns out, we can't make minimum credit card payments and keep the household running. Not asking for handouts at all, just advice. I've never been late/had bad credit before in my life. 

Facts: 

1. Minimum payment on the cards (we have 6) is about $800/mo. Some are interest free at the moment, so I expect that number to go higher when that promotion ends. Most are maxed out, or pretty close to it.

2. My wife's hours were cut back to part time at work, and she's tried to use this time to get a dream business of hers going (with some success). This is the other part of the issue, but the truth of the matter is if she was making what she was prior to getting her hours cut, we'd be *just* making it as opposed to getting ahead.

Questions: I've called at least one credit card and they're willing to help - they put us in an ""Early Assistance"" program, which suspends things like late payments, etc. so we can pay as we can. The problem is, we still can't afford it the payments overall and it seems as if this could put us back further in the weeds ultimately. Should we be seeking debt consolidation, or is there some other solutions here that can help?

I'm very stressed out and depressed...so I'm sorry if this is rambling. I'm happy to clarify anything if needed.

So the question is what to do until then? FWIW I'm 28. 

Relevant financial information (total $5025 net):

* Monthly net (only taxes/FICA taken out): $4400
* Income from roommates: $625/mo (rent only, they pay 2/3 of utils as well but that fluctuates) 

Expenses (total $2978):

* Mortgage - $830/mo ($90,500 left @ 4.6% with 28 years remaining and I'm planning to sell it, or rent it out, in 2-3 years)
* Utils - $430/mo average (roommates pay 2/3 of it but I don't factor that in to these calcs as it fluctuates)
* Medical - $425/mo (have to go through open market and have medical stuff requiring a more expansive plan) **
* Life learning lesson due to an exwife - $400/mo 
* Car : $348/mo+$140/mo for gas/insurance

Student loans (all federal) I figured should be their own section:

* 1) 9,084.58 @ 6.8% - $120/mo
* 2) 11,981.94 @ 6.8% - $135/mo
* 3) 12,391.56 @ 6.8% - $150/mo

* 2015 Roth - $1000 so far
* Liquid cash - $7700
* No CC debt (paid in full monthly) 

My thoughts are as follows (note these are once I get a permanent position, but averaged out as I'll be saving the money in liquid funds until then) using $2k/mo post expenses:

* 1) Max Roth contribution. Averaged out over 7 months to year end is $650/mo leaving $1350/mo net
* 2) Put $1k/month towards student loans. At the end of August (3 months out) I'll be really close to being able to pay off loan 1 directly and will likely tap into emergency fund a little to just pay it off. 
* 3) Roll the $120/mo from loan 1 to loan 2 payments+$1k/mo until 401k matching becomes available in Feb of next year. This will bring my balance on loan 2 down to about $6500
* 4) This leaves $350/mo for stuff like groceries and other shit+roommate utilities income of ~$400/mo. I may end up using this to throw some more randomly at the loans, but it's more for house/liquid/emergency savings

**Summary/Questions/TL:DR** - Am I missing anything here? Should I be doing something different, perhaps putting money towards my traditional IRA? The only other real option is to forego the Roth and put $2k/mo to student loans. That would let me have loan 1 and 2 basically paid off when 401k matching becomes available at the expense of retirement/savings. 

*I do understand this is still ultimately a contract job until I get the permanent offer and as such should plan for that. Which is what I'm doing. The next 3 months will be saving as much as I can through the contract period. Boss has made comments about thinking the contract is only a month more, and he would love to bring me on sooner (although unlikely to happen). But like I said until I actually have the permanent position I'm working to save as much as I can of it. 

**Net income/remaining income is, let's say, $2k ($5k net - $3k expenses) for the next 4 months. After that I'll be able to get on the company medical plan with HSA (although slightly lower income most likely as contracted rate is hourly rate+cost to me of medical, perm rate will just be the hourly rate), which I'll be maxing out each year. But for these calculations medical would be the same through the rest of this year (I'll actually increase them most likely to hit $3300 HSA limit but that changes a lot so just want to use same $400/mo for ease of calculations).",finance,1432985487

Hi PF,

My wife had TEACH grants when she was in college. For those that don't know, these are grants awarded to students who plan to teach 4 years in a high needs school after graduating.

She has to ""actively certify"" that she is teaching every year or the grants will be converted into unsubsidized student loans. She does this by filling out online forms and also snail mailing forms to the Fed.

She has done all of this and we still received an email this morning that she failed to actively certify and that all the grants are now loans. Real convenient considering it's Saturday and we are supposed to fly out for vacation today.

personalfinance,Should I use this 401(k) loan to pay off my student loan?,"We bought a house before selling our old house.  Since bridge loans are largely a thing of the past, I was told to take out a 401(k) loan to bridge the gap.

Unfortunately, I made some bad assumptions about what we'd get out of selling our old house, and bought a lot of new home furnishings that I thought I'd have cash for post-sale.

When everything was said and done, I was about $5k short of being able to pay off the 401(k) loan.

But that means I have almost exactly enough to pay off my student loan.

To me, it makes sense to do this.  I can either pay off most of the 401(k) loan now, pay the rest back over two years, and pay the student loan off over about six years; or I can pay off the student loan now, and pay the 401(k) loan back over five years.

It gets me out of debt about a year earlier, the interest rate on the 401(k) loan is lower, and with the 401(k) loan you actually pay the interest to yourself.

So I'm really not seeing a downside here.

The second has about £90 in it (and no, I'm not kidding), and I have no idea what it's invested in.

My new employer has no pension scheme at all (too small to be impacted by the change in the law), and I'm happy with that as I want to plough my money into a larger deposit and remortgage.  My question is, is there any point doing anything with them?  It's a middling amount of money in that I don't want to lose it, but equally it seems daft worrying about it.  However, I'm very fussy about getting good interest rates etc.

Should I just wait until my company implements a pension scheme (which could be 12+ months depending on our growth - as I understand it when we hit 50 staff we'll need one) and then roll my old ones into it?",finance,1432992640

I don't know what to do or where to start explaining my situation.  I need a plan and a way to get through this while maintaining my sanity.
Student debt: yes, it was stupid; yes, it's a ton, it's my responsibility, I  should've never done it, I was stupid, etc - whatever along those lines you think, I've already thought it; yes, I wish I never took it out, etc.  I don't need to be told that.  It is the most depressing thing I deal with in my life.

School: attended art college (STUPID) from 2007-2009, and it's where most of my debt comes from.  After $70k, my aunt stopped cosigning halfway through my sophomore year second semester because it was too much and she said I would never be able to pay it back as an artist. Knew practically nothing about paying for school or money upon graduating.  My mom and brother now come to me for help with things like the FAFSA and I teach them.

I took 2009-2012 off from school because I couldn't access my transcripts to send to other schools, since I owed money.  I dealt with various degrees of incapacitating depression during that time (where I would go a week without showering, would only get out of bed to go to the bathroom or get food).  Had two minimum wage jobs in that time, lasted about a year each, and my parents took all of the money I made from my first job because they said I owed it to them.  I owed money to my art school for which they'd only release my transcripts one time if I paid them $3,000 and my parents took out a loan for it.
Attended state school from 2012-2013 hoping to be smart and minimize my further debt.  I changed my career pursuit to nursing, which I know now where I work (as an PCA, more on that further down) will get me about $70k/year gross to start; I knew back then it was more profitable and it would allow an easier time paying back loans.  I tried transferring into the program internally, and I was not accepted.  (3.6gpa, one person was admitted out of many, but nursing is competitive and I didn't plan for this; again, stupid, stupid, stupid)

I then attended a private nursing school from 2013 to part of 2014, since which I've taken a leave of absence from various issue: depression, abuse, money, car...

When I took the leave of absence at the end of October 2014, I was struggling greatly.  I was so depressed that I could not force myself out of bed in the morning.  I could not concentrate on my reading.  I would have panic attacks.  I tried dorming because I thought it would allow me to escape from my parents, but I found myself on my own tackling those demons by myself unsuccesfully.  I wish I had been stronger.  It got to the point where I'd missed so much class time that I would've been kicked out, so I took a leave of absence.  The week I did so, I had called the suicide hotline numerous amount of times in one week and kind of attempted (poured a full bottle of propranolol in my mouth before spitting it out).  It very much scares me that with all the stress I'm under, I will return to this state mentally when I return.

I want to return to nursing school in September.

At the private nursing school, I have 2 semesters left, but once/if I return there I will get into ~30k more of debt.  

However, I also just applied to a community college, and if I'm accepted, then I don't have to go on the 2 year waiting list and though it will take me 3 semesters instead, until December 2016.  I would get in ~16k debt or less, depending on financial aid.  I am going to find out within a week whether I was accepted or not and the details.  I contemplated waiting until then to  post, but I'd rather post ASAP for car reasons.

Other school related things- I made decisions upon returning to school when I did because I was trying to defer payments on my loans as long as possible and was worried about how to pay for them.  No matter how much I try to plan or decide, it has always been wrong, it seems.

Current work/money situation: 
I work as a PCA (patient care associate, AKA nurses' aide/ CNA) at a hospital.  I make $16/weeknight or $18.50/weekend night.  (This is because my base pay is $12, plus an added $2.50 for evenings, $4 for nights, and $2 for weekends.  I frequently try to work doubles on Saturday mornings (aka Friday 11pm to Saturday 3pm) because I make time and a half for doubles or overtime including the differentials).  I am ""per diem,"" which means I make my own schedule/ pick up hours when I can.  On average, I make around $2,000 gross a month (at least, what I had figured out as of May 1).  I work anywhere from 32-40+ hours a week, as many as 62.  Here are my bi-weekly paycheck amounts from January until now:

date -  gross - net

5/29/15 - 561.83 -  447.57

5/15/15 - 546.39 - 436.38

5/1/15  - 903.99	 - 700.32

4/17/15 - 777.42 - 604.49

3/6/15 - 733.56 - 572.25

2/20/15 - 1178.44 - 859.19

2/6/15 - 1241.39 - 940.90

(I didn't work for all of January due to a back injury I got while preventing a patient from falling)

Generally, per a month, I spend:

$55 on my phone

$250-400 on groceries and food (which includes take out and fast food that I need to cut back on, as well as paying for my boyfriend frequently when I only see him a few times a week)

$100-200 on medication/ medication copays/ doctors visits

$100/ month for 3 of my student loans

various amounts on other things; which in the past few months, have included things like $60 for a in room closet (since I have no clothing storage furniture nor closet), concert tickets ($80 on 2 concerts since February, and $100 on one DC4C concert that I plan to sell on stubhub and should've never bought), and clothes (some necessary, because of pants not fitting or having no shorts, but maybe ~$80 on clothes I didn't need?)
I have $4,000 in checking, and $500 in savings (? just so that I wouldn't be tempted to touch it, and also because my bank has a savings acount apr of 3% on up to $500)

These are my recent credit card statements ): - which are ever since I've started paying for food and my copays.

May:  710.75 

April: 729.92

March: 732.21

February: 934.75

January:  558.75

December:  704.55

Before December, I was only paying each month for literally my phone bill, the student loans, and occasional work food or cab.

If anyone wants, I could use my mint.com information to post specific transactions per month.

After looking more in depth at this, I'm astounded by how much I'm spending each month on simply food and groceries.  I mean, I knew it was a lot, but I didn't know it was THAT much.  I spend a ton of time at my boyfriend's apartment (maybe somewhere up to 50% of the week sometimes), during which I'll pay for things for their house such as bulk toilet paper, paper towels, plastic utensils, etc (which I figure is the least I can do since I'm over there so much, I'll also clean when I can).  I'll also pay for take out or fast food a lot, frequently paying for my boyfriend as well (I'm realizing I'm doing this very often; the take out or dine in happens maybe twice a month that I'll pay for, but I'll generally always pay for our fast food).   I was going along paying for this thinking ""well, it's food, and I need to eat.""

Well, it looks like my biggest thing I need to figure out how to cut back on is food and groceries?  My inital plans are to cut back/not get take out and to spend time preparing meals instead of buying frozen food, to buy cans of soda or bottles of water instead of more expensive individual drinks, etc.  I also want to kind of ""steal"" a thing my ex used to do, which was prepare meals for the week in a crock pot for very cheap.  My parents say they they can help me more with this because they didn't realize I was spending so much, but I don't want to burden them with more.

My parents:  Living with them is both a huge blessing and has at the same time taken a huge toll on my mental health.  They pay $660/month for the rest of my student loans that I do not pay for, which I am so grateful for (huge blessing), among other things like some food, as well as just letting me live here.  However, in the same breath, they are abusive to live with.   My dad has gotten on top of me and tried to choke me and my mother, he has threatened to kill me, came at me with a knife acting like he would stab me, came at me with a knife saying to kill him, threatened suicide then disappeared, is an alcoholic, throws things at me, has tried to smother me... this has gone on since I was a kid, but I didn't come to the realization/ admit to myself that this wasn't normal until last summer.  He drives me to every night shift I work, because we work the same shift at the same place (-blessing), but for the whole ride he screams swears at/about me putting me down, honks at least three times, drives generally recklessly, calls people the n-word or other profanities (-curse/ damaging to my mental health).  They do not allow me to drive their car, so I depend on them or a cab or bus for rides.  Ever since December or so I have stopped responding to any of this and remain silent for the whole drive, which worked at first, but not anymore.  My mom has become similar, probably from  years of abuse at the hands of my father.  She screams at the top of her lungs at me for doing something like leaving my room, saying one thing to her that interrupts a show she's watching, and so I go back to my room - where I spend all of my time, except to go to the bathroom, shower, get food, or leave/enter, essentially.  Most recently, when I called out of work the other night, she told me she didn't believe that I had a headache (that has now lasted two weeks) and that I go to the doctors too much/am making it up.  Today, she told me that she never said that, and that she told me to go to the doctors.  She does that - for example, she tells me that I can succeed in school and at work, but then at another time when she's in a rage, will tell me that I will never amount to anything because of xyz.  My brother tells me every time I see him (or at least 98%) to hang myself or die of cancer.  He swears at me when I stay downstairs in the living room.  This only used to happen when I would be negative to my family and complain, but now all of this happens with every interaction with them no matter what.  Trying to apologize for my terribleness, being kind, and not responding to their violence has not made it better/ go away.  If anything, it has made it worse.  I am told regularly that they do not want me here and I am the cause of everyone's problems.  Staying here for extended periods of time makes me very depressed and worsens my panic attacks.

I have wanted to move out, but I really don't think I have many viable options?  I would need to start paying all of my loans by myself as well as rent ($300/month if I moved in with my boyfriend) and things I take for granted that they pay for.

My mental health:   I am pretty sure that most of my health problems are from stress and anxiety.

I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since December 2009 when I had a psychotic break from depression.  I'm on meds and have tried 15-20 others.  I have been hospitalized once since then, three years ago.  I used to suffer from almost daily panic attacks, sometimes as many as three times a day, that would last for hours with me sobbing and hyperventilating.  This happened the most when I returned to school, and especially in Spring of 2014 when I was under a lot of stress in school, thinking all the time about my debt, family stress, and relationship issues (with an ex of four years that broke up with me a year ago).  It goes through periods of being under control and then worsening.  I have tried very very hard to develop better coping skills and rarely have panic attacks to the point of hyperventilating and being completely irrational, but as a result, I think I have anxiety in the background all of the time.  Low grade depression, as well, that sometimes manifests in me wanting to die because of all the stress in my life, my debt, schooling, and seeing no hope for the future.  Putting off figuring out all of this school/money/work/budgeting stress seems to have made my anxiety worse (with an onset of bad tension headaches).  I feel my depression and anxiety getting much worse again very rapidly.  I am very concerned with how I will handle everything once I am back in nursing school.  I cannot underscore this point enough.  I am currently having thoughts of how it would be better if I just killed myself, but that pops up from time to time and I think I can dismiss it for now.

Health:  I have asthma, which at its worst will give me daily attacks, but it's under control right now.  I have generalized aches all over my body daily.  Seasonal allergies, which makes my nose runny/eyes watery and itchy/sneezy, etc, for which only benadryl helps.  I have unexplained tachycardia, where my resting heart rate is usually above 100, up to 150 (before I started typing this and took my propranolol, which lowers it, it was at 120).  This is probably stress or a medication side effect.  I got an EKG and Echocardiogram, which were normal, and I was supposed to get a Holter monitor, but I didn't go to the appointment because I felt ridiculous.  I break out in hives all over my body every day, and I haven't figured out why, other than it's probably anxiety?  This has been happening for months, but has worsened and the hives are now bigger, last longer, and are harder to get rid of.  They cover my legs and arms up and down, at their worse, and are insanely itchy.  I've ruled out detergents, soaps, etc.  I can't find any pattern to food or anything else that would cause it.  I have eczema as well, which I use hydrocortisone cream for.  Constipation - I have had this chronically for over three years now.  A doctor proposed IBS and suggested a GI doctor consult, which never happened.  It takes me 40 minutes at at time, up to two or three times a day, once or twice a week to have a bowel movement.  I have been taking Lactulose for it, after trying a variety of other things.  At its worst, I will not have gone for a week and need to take Magnesium citrate to go, after which over the next 24 hours I'm back and forth to the bathroom.  I always seem to have nausea or heartburn, which I think goes along with the constipation, and now, headaches.  Headaches- I've taken ibuprofen every day for headaches, usually right after work, for the last few months.

Currently, I had a headache that lasted for all of last week, and on and off this week (as pain meds wear off).  The pain was so bad to the point where I could only tolerate laying in bed with a heat pack on my neck and an ice pack on my head, barely moving.  When I returned to work this past Tuesday, the only day I worked this week, I threw up and my headache came back full force.  Moving exacerbates it, and that is the most moving around I've done since I've had these bad headaches.  On the 20th, my doctor said it was a tension headache.  I've gotten IV fluids, zofran, Toradol x 2, Robaxin, and Tramadol, none of which keeps them away.  I went to the ER the 18th and my doctor the 20th, called my doctor again the 22nd and was prescribed Tramadol, and called again yesterday.  I waited so long because I feel ridiculous.  They never called me back?

All this health stuff is most certainly stress related, and the depression and anxiety meds are what cost me the most money other than buying ibuprofen, Pepcid, Benadryl, and other things.  I am getting completely fed up with feeling so sick all the time.  ? It leads to spending a lot of money as well, which I cannot afford. ):  I feel like my parents don't take me seriously, I don't know if doctors take me seriously because all of it is probably stress related, but all of this affects me on a daily basis and I just want it... not to.


Car:  I am trying to figure out what to do to get a car.  With my credit, I can get a loan.  Actually, I am currently approved for a $7,000 loan through my bank, but I requested that amount before actually picking out a car or doing more research.  But, with the research I've been doing, I think I can get an ok-ish car in that ballpark or hopefully under.  My monthly payment would be about $112/month and car insurance would be $300/month (yikes ): )- it's a guess,  but it's how much my parents' insurance went up after adding me.  I don't know actually, yet, how much I'd have to pay for car insurance.
Is their a better way to do this?  I am completely lost.  Does anyone have advice speficific to my situation on what I can do to buy a car?  I really need one, ideally, by the time school starts again.

Health insurance:  This is huge.  I am going to lose this in two months when I turn 26.  I am kind of ignoring this but I can't do that forever.  I could get a plan through my college once I return, I think.  Or, I could try to go for a non per-diem job at my work that would have benefits, but I am unsure of my ability to be a responsible employee while I am in school.  It has been hard enough for me to work out scheduling myself per diem based around my health and mental health.  I am very concerned with how I will handle work and school and do not want to jeopardize losing my job because my boss has basically said she'll hire me as a nurse once I graduate.  I have learned from coworkers that starting nurses at my hospital make around $70k/year gross (with differentials) when working full time.

So, basically, any advice anyone has would be very much appreciated ): I feel like I'm drowing with no way out.  I feel like ever since realizing the huge mistake of the art school loans, I have planned my life around what to do to repay them.  Even if I worked many more hours than I already do, it is not enough for me to do everything I'm trying to do currently.",finance,1432999198
finance,"Trying to rent a house, property manager needs proof of income, won't accept anything I can show him. Ideas?","So my BF and I have been living together for almost 8 years now, renting for all that time:

* 1 year in 1 appartment in FL (my BF lived there even longer before I moved in)
* 5 years in 1 appartment in NC
* 2 years in 1 house in GA

We were planning on staying in this house for at least 1 more year while I finish up school (the reason we moved here), but the people who own the home we live in are moving back at the end of our lease so we have to find a new place to stay.  It's a huge inconvenience, but there's nothing we can do about it.

We found a new house nearby that is very similar to the one we're renting now and we have applied to rent it.  The only problem is that the property managers require proof of income and apparently they won't accept any of the proof we've submitted.

My BF and I are very financially secure.  We have more than enough to put a down payment on a nice house, but we haven't done it because we aren't planning on staying here very long, and as you can see from our history, we move around a lot.  It doesn't make any sense to buy a house especially since we are very likely moving again in the next year or two.  We'll probably buy a house *next time* around, but not right now.

I make all of my income from investments.  I had a trust fund growing up that turned into an investment account and I've been managing it myself for over 10 years now.  It's substantial and it's more than enough to pay for my expensive out-of-state professional and graduate school tuition as well as other living expenses including rent.  I take money out of the account no more than 2 or 3 times a year and make sure that I take out enough for tuition and other living expenses each time.  I don't have a regular job and haven't had one since about a year ago, so I don't get a W2 or a biweekly check/paystub which is what the rental property wants.  Instead, I gave them the front page of my federal income tax return for the past 3 years, each one showing that I declared more than enough money to pay the monthly rent.  On my own, too, not even including what my BF makes.

My boyfriend is co-owner of his family's business and currently isn't taking any salary because he is reinvesting everything into the business while it grows.  He gets occasional checks from various rental properties that his family owns which cover half of our living expenses and incidentals, but he *also* doesn't have a biweekly paystub.  They won't accept his tax forms either.

Their excuse when we ask them why showing them our declared income isn't sufficient is that ""that money could be gone by now,"" which I think is absurd.  1 semester of my out-of-state tuition costs more than the entire year-long value of the lease.  We have an 8 year history of paying rent every month, on time, with no problems, and have provided all of the relevant names to them but they won't check the references because ""we really only do that if there is a problem.""  When we press them to check anyway they come up with other excuses like ""we really just need to see your income because this homeowner has had problmes collecting rent in the past.""

We have shown them proof of income!  We have a very long history of paying rent on time!  I'm not going to default on my rent and risk getting evicted in the middle of the school year that I paid a ridiculous amount of money to attend!  Why is my Federal Income Tax form good enough for the government but not good enough for this company?

This is the only rental company that has even asked us for proof of income so far.  Everyone else has been satisfied with a background check (clean for both of us) and a credit check (&gt;700 for both of us).  I would have given up on these guys by now if I didn't *really* like the house they are renting.  It is the best one we viewed by far because it fits our needs, is a good price, is in a good area and is in good condition.  I don't want to lose this house just because we couldn't find a way to prove to these people that we are good tenants.

The guy on the phone made a joke (I think it was a joke) about paying the entire lease value up front.  That's not how renting works, and frankly I don't trust these guys since they apparently don't trust us.  We have enough money to do that, but we're not *buying* anything, we're renting.  Not to mention that paying upfront deprives me of the interest that money could have earned if it had stayed in my investment account.  It's not insignificant.  When my BF told him ""that's not how renting works"" the guy laughed, but didn't have any other solutions.

So my question is this: is there some sort of way to prove to this guy that we are financially responsible other than the other things we've already tried?  Would an escrow account work?  I'd rather not do that due to the lost interest, but it's a step above just paying everything up front.  Is there some sort of statement I can get from my bank that these guys would listen to?  I'm completely at a loss here and I have never had this problem before and I just don't know what to do.  Any advice or ideas you guys can offer would be great.

**TL;DR: My BF and I have an 8-year history of being good renters (paying on time, always get deposit back) and we have tons of money, but neither of us gets a regular paystub.  How can we prove to our prospective landlords that we will pay our rent on time when they won't check our references or accept our tax forms?**",finance,1432999931

personalfinance,Variable interest rates vs. Fixed interest rates on student loans?,"Hello, long story short I am trying to figure out what is the best option for me in terms of finding a private loan to fund tuition. I need about 12k in loans to cover the rest and it looks like the two ""best"" options are Sallie Mae or a Parent Plus Loan. Sallie Mae has two choices for rate loans, being variable and fixed. The variable ones look tempting because they range from 6% to 7% but I know this could skyrocket at anytime depending on the market (But it could also drop). Their fixed rates are higher at 7.875% to 8.875% but I suppose these would stay the same throughout the entire loan duration. Now Parent Plus Loans have a fixed interest rate of about 7.210% which is pretty high but less than Sallie Mae's fixed rates. However, PLUS loans have a disbursement fee and are in my parent's names. Having read all that, could anyone who's been down this path offer me any advice as to what to choose? Sallie Mae's fixed options look tempting because they are only about ~1.5% higher than the Parent Plus Loans and they would be in my name after I get a job and release my parent as the cosigner but I have heard horror stories about using Sallie Mae.

Because we have no credit the credit union says that they have to give us an E credit rating and that alternate forms of credit, like paying my bills on time and having a lease, won't factor in.  They have said that the only type of loans I would qualify for are adjustable rate mortgages or a first time home buyer loan that has an interest rate that is one percentage higher than their other mortgages.  They haven't told me what this rate will be with an E credit rating but I am assuming it will be high.

I make 45,000 a year and my husband makes minimum wage working around 30 hours a week. I've saved 26,000 dollars for a down-payment on a house and hope to save a few thousand more in the next few months or so.  Our budget for a house is around 100,000-130,000.   

I have tried several times over the last few years to build credit by getting a credit card and have  been denied by my credit union, amazon, and macy's due to a lack of credit history.

personalfinance,Credit Score Question,"Me and my fiancee will be getting married this October and grossing about $140k per year in annual income before taxes. Currently, we are planning to move into an apartment for ~$900 per month for a one year lease. After this lease is up, we would like to begin house hunting for a new house.

This is where the problem begins. My fiancee has a good credit score (around 700 she told me). She uses her credit card as a debit card for groceries and other purchases, then pays the entire balance off at the end of the month (i.e. no interest charges).

I, on the other hand, have no credit score because I've never had a credit card. I don't see the point in having a credit card, to pay it off with my debit card at the end of the month. It seems like a needless middle step.

My question mainly pertains to: 

1) how will banks view our credit scores combined when applying for a loan on a house?

2) Will banks refuse to loan to us if I have a bad credit score but can still put a large down payment up front (20-40% cash)?

3) With putting a large down payment up front, will the interest rate be larger if I don't have a credit score for us?

4) do I need to get a credit card and begin building a credit score as my fiancee is doing now?

5) Would I have a credit rating from renting an apartment over the past three years?

General suggestions on this finance problem would be greatly appreciated. I'm somewhat stubborn and don't want to get a credit card. I was raised in a Dave Ramsey home spending style of no credit cards.",finance,1433014855

personalfinance,"My family is about to inherit upwards of 950K, what can I do to make sure we don't blow it?","(Short Version): In the near future my family (Mom, Dad, Brother, and myself) are going to be inheriting upwards of a Million Dollars from my Grandmother and I want to know what I can do to make sure my parents, brother and I create a stable future for ourselves.

(Long Version): My Grandfather was a Federal Agent from around 1955 - 1985 and was a smart and responsible guy, he saved and invested for years to make sure after he was gone his wife and family would be taken care of, I spent most of my childhood doing stuff with him and his passing at 78 hit me really hard (I was 10, it was 2006). I plan on following in his footsteps and becoming a Federal Agent.

Last weekend my Mother went for her Bi-Weekly visit with my Grandmother and when she got there my Grandmother was sitting at her kitchen table with my Grandfather's Lawyer, and she told my Mom they had to talk. My Grandmother was diagnosed with a Medical Condition about 4 years ago and she doesn't have much more time before she passes, although she did blow the fucking roof off of the 2 years the Doctor told her she had to live. Anyway, my Grandmother and her Lawyer then went over with my Mom that based on her savings and the sale of her Condo she will be receiving roughly 975k in Inheritance and also my Brother and I will both be receiving 50k each and an other undisclosed amount of money strictly for College Tuition which at the point of Graduation whatever money is leftover would be split between my brother and I.

The main point of my question here is what can I do to make sure we don't blow it, I want to make sure my parents can have a happy retirement and not worry about their future. My main concern is that they aren't very good with money. My Father is a Mechanic that specializes in antique Volkswagen and Audi cars, and my Mother is the head of the Medical Records Department at our local hospital, and as far as I know they are in roughly 2K worth of personal debt and nothing more. However I'm afraid based on my Father's impulsive behavior that he will blow away a lot of their retirement money on personal project cars (I mean he does attain the business skills to buy,restore, and flip cars) but I worry he'll bury himself in to many projects to complete along with expensive tools and equipment. The worst thing I see my Mother doing would be buying a house  to big for what she needs and spending large chunks of money on expensive contractors to renovate said house (She's obsessed with HGTV shows). Other than that they're responsible adults and I am confident they can handle their finances beyond the initial money shock.

As far as my Brother goes I am not worried, he's a cook at a local restaurant and working on getting a degree at the local community college, he's good with money and saves most of his earnings.

I'm 18 and entering my senior year of High School and hope to eventually become a Federal Agent like my Grandfather. It's actually a coincident that my first choice College is also the one that my Grandfather attended in 1950, so I guess I'll have the legacy thing going for me. I want to get a Degree in Criminal Justice, get some Law Enforcement experience and eventually apply to place like US Customs, The FBI, or CIA.

I have 0 debt, a savings of $6,000, and very few bills. I spend roughly $100 a month on food, $100 a month on Gas and $80 a month on my phone bill, which I pay for with my weekend job at 7/11.

The only money I'd spend would be on a 2004-2008 Subaru Wrx Sti (Long time dream car), Car insurance, and costs to completely restore the car. This wouldn't cost me more than $25,000 (High Estimate) with the added benefit that I could also sell my current car to help pay for the costs (Current Car is worth roughly $8,000)

The Strictly College Money is more than enough to pay for my tuition, living expenses, and my brother's as well with more than a 50% overflow. 

Any advice on my families situation here would be greatly appreciated, and I'm sorry for writing so much, it's just a lot to take in, writing it down like this helps me organize my thoughts a little more.

personalfinance,General financial overview and asset allocation,"Hey PF!
I want to start with saying that as a year long lurker of this subreddit I want to thank everyone who contributes to this community. When I received my first 'real*job' paycheck a year ago with wide*eyes I looked for guidance and found this awesome place. PF has been instrumental in developing a more mature outlook of my finances and gave me the tools and information I needed to reach some of my financial goals in the past year and for many years to come!


This is however, another 'how is my 401k allocation' thread. So if you are sick of these I'll understand if you stop here!


Background:

- 23 years old
- Currently making 52k.
- Just became eligible to contribute to my 401k.
- Will be contributing 20% of my gross income starting next paycheck.
- Will also be maxing out a Roth IRA through vanguard.
- Only debt is 36k in federal student loans @ 6.8%
- I have a 6k emergency fund in a savings account. (Thanks PF!)
- I paid cash for my car. (Thanks again PF!)


Questions:
The 20% (~$10,400 annually) I am contributing to my 401k will be split up as follows:

- 80% (52% of annual investments) Principal Global Investors LargeCap S&amp;P 500 Index (0.53% ER)
- 8%  (5% of annual investments) Principal Global Investors MidCap S&amp;P 400 Index (0.53% ER)
- 12% (8% of annual investments) Principal Global Investors SmallCap S&amp;P 600 Index (0.53% ER)


For the Roth IRA ($5500 annually) I was looking at VASIX or VSCGX. These are 40%stocks/60%bonds and 20%s/80%b respectively. I am leaning more towards bonds because I would like to keep about half of what I currently have in savings for an eFund and keep the rest in one of these liquid Roth IRA's so that I still have access to it if I really need it, otherwise it will be growing and will help to diversify my overall portfolio.



&gt;What do you guys think about the above asset allocations?



These investments leave me around $600 monthly to put towards my student loans. This will have me with paying off my student loans in 6 years. My reasoning behind putting more towards retirement than paying down my student loans is as follows:

- I will not be able to contribute in the future what I wish I had contributed now because of the annual contribution caps.
- The amount saved in interest by quickly paying down the loan is nothing compared to the compound interest I could earn by not waiting to contribute to retirement accounts.



&gt;Am I missing anything major in this reasoning? I feel like it comes down to if you want relatively small short term gains (saved interest on student loans) or much larger long*term gains (compound interest on retirement accounts).



This leaves plenty of leftover loot (~$1300ish) for expenses and the occasional extra student loan payment (or evil consumer purchase).


If you made it this far, then thank you for your time!

personalfinance,(SA) What is the average low-risk interest rate in New York?,"Hi, I'm writing an article that only briefly touches on banking in the US (particularly NY), and I'm not sure if the same systems, terminology and conventions apply there as they do in South Africa.  
  
My basic question is: what would the average interest rate be on a small amount of cash that the user has put into savings, for example. My article proposes a man putting small amounts of money away (between $5 and $12 a day) and earning interest on them over the period of 15 years.  
  
Some articles I've read suggest a 10% interest rate in Stocks, but that sounds a little hard to believe. And even if it's true, practically, my hypothetical man wouldn't jump straight into Stocks investment with his first $12.  
  
Capital Bank's site suggests an interest rate of 0.05%, but that seems a bit low to my inexperienced eye. I thought at first that this was because it listed it under a Money Trader account (which I assume means that you can take out that money whenever you want it), but it goes on to set the same 0.05% for Personal Savings (which I would assume means that you CAN'T just take out that money whenever you want it). I must be wrong somewhere here...?

Graduate: pharmacy school as out-of-state resident, which cost ~$60K (the only in-state pharmacy school was private, so it would have cost more to go there instead)

personalfinance,Fear despite a budget,"Thanks to this subreddit, I've started keeping a tighter watch on my finance and have made a game plan for getting out of debt, building an emergency fund, etc. Currently I have budgeted to put $500/month in an emergency fund, and pay $600/month on debt payments (that's minimum payments on student loans, 2 of 3 credit cards, car payment, and $60 extra that I'll be putting into the item with the highest interest rate and rolling back into paying other debts as things get paid off). At this rate, I'll have a 3 month emergency fund built up in 11 months, and with the debt payoff plan I've devised, I'll have that all paid off in 5 years.

My budget plan for June includes some extra income from a housesitting gig I'll be taking on, so I've planned to pour most of my income from that gig into paying off a store credit card with a rather high interest rate. My plan was to do this by paying off that CC with yesterday's paycheck and then finishing my monthly savings with the housesitting money and my other paycheck for June.

But then I got paid yesterday and sat down to check my budget, and I froze. I don't know if it's the stress of my job (knowing I'm not the best at it and living in constant fear of getting fired in spite of indications that it probably isn't the case, and in spite of knowing I can probably get a new job quickly), or what the deal is, but suddenly I'm petrified of paying off that credit card. It's only $340 currently, so I can still pay extra on it each month and pay it off in a reasonable amount of time, but I know it would cost me interest. I can also pay it off with my next paycheck and probably do that before another month of interest accrues because my next paycheck is a couple days before the CC billing date. My instinct right now is to just squirrel away the cash in my EF, though. Am I chickening out? What are your thoughts on this, PF?

**MEETING**

So, the main thing I wanted was to be secure w/ my retirement income. I am in the process of rolling over my Fidelity to my 401a. I opened the Vanguard Roth and did the 2060 retirement fund. She also advised me to purchase stocks based on things I like, so I opened the LOYAL3 account and bought $10 worth of shares of Google, Apple, Berkshire, Samsung, Facebook, and Intel.

I also brought up the idea for me to pay off my car loan earlier by making full payments biweekly instead of monthly. She disagreed because my car still loses value. She did suggest, however, to refinance it to 1.49% APY.

I don’t know the main differences between a ROTH and a Traditional IRA, but since I was recommended the ROTH, I used that.

I have about 2k in savings extra after all my bills and budgeting; my main question was what to do with it? We decided to build my emergency fund up to 10k (she originally suggested 15k, but I don’t need that much), and then contribute the max to my ROTH.

personalfinance,26F needs advice about saving vs. student loan repayment,"Hi PF,

I'd like to ask for advice regarding how to best distribute my money. Here is my breakdown:

Income: $50k/yr + commission, so currently around $3200-$3300/mo (after taxes), but hopefully will be going up quite a bit in the next 6 months due to commission

Rent: $1250 + $50 utilities &amp; internet--I live in a REALLY expensive city, so unfortunately finding cheaper rent isn't really an option (and yes, I already have a roommate)

Phone: $80/mo (I pay for mine and for a parent that I financially support)

Car: $300/mo (Currently being paid by my bf every month because he uses the car at this point--has about $8500 left at 0% apr)

Food: $250/mo (again, I support a parent, and so this budget reflects the amount for the both of us)

Car insurance: $115/mo (I pay for both my bf and I since he pays the car payment)

Netflix: $8/mo

Laundry: $20/mo

Misc. stuff (going out with friends, eating out every once in awhile, traveling to see my bf): ~$125/mo

That comes to just under $1,900. 

For student loans, I currently have around $37,000 left. I'd say about $20k of it is at an interest rate of 6.8%, the remaining at 4-5%. My savings account has somewhere between $5-6k in it. I do not contribute to any sort of 401k or retirement fund. 

This is where my question comes in. I've been putting about $700/mo towards my student loan. I can put more towards it, but should I instead be trying to put more towards my savings account to reach around $10k for an emergency fund? Should I be contributing to some sort of retirement fund?

financialindependence,Maxing out IRA while a college student,"I'll be graduating from high school within a week and then continuing on to college. I'm attending a local community college for two years so each semester is only $2,000-$2,500. At the moment, my 529 has around $60,000.

Is it more valuable to max out an IRA as soon as possible even if I have college tuition to worry about once I transfer? Would it be more beneficial to start saving for college expenses rather than maxing out my IRA or would one interest rate outweigh the other?

personalfinance,"Almost a year in hell, is there anyone who can steer me in a new direction?","Hello,

I have never posted in Reddit before, and frankly it never occurred to me to post on here, especially about my situation. I generally just browse. I do hope maybe someone out there has some answers to share. Thank you all in advance. Regardless, here in the gist of my situation, and after that a total breakdown. 

I am a 19 year old male living in New Jersey. I graduated last year from high school in the top 1% of my class from a rather reputable high school, with 35 college credits under my belt, national awards and some enticing offers to colleges, some which, from an academic standing, offered full rides. Since August last year, I've worked as a night time janitor, paid for and continue to go to community college to this day, worked as a facilities engineer in a hotel close to New York full time, moved out of my parents house at their suggestion, left the hotel and back to night janitorial, and now am temporarily living with a friend. 

In the meantime, I have been able to accumulate an over 700 credit score, have history with my phone company in order to be in a contract soon, and can graduate with an associates in Business Administration this winter. 

Why all this? I am a not fully undocumented immigrant. 

I was brought to the US at an early age and have been here 14 years this October. I went through most of my life here. Please, I don't need any hate for my status. I get it all sides. But I'm trying to survive. Don't hate me for that at least. In 2012 I was lucky to be able to receive DACA, which is deferred action for childhood arrivals, and am allowed to work legally, pay taxes for everything, and drive. It does NOT give benefits that I needed such as federal aid for school. 

I will break down other parts but here is a financial bit for those who do not want to continue reading: I have $800 right now in savings, a car I own, and clothes. I'm no schmuck; I have many unique and higher education experiences such as interning at town hall, experience in owning my own business, and real life work in various, various jobs. From hotel engineer to pizza maker. I've been going around looking for jobs that I can make decent money with because of the amount of money it will require me to get a degree. What should I do? I can't live with my friend here for too too long. My parents is not an option. Not because I don't want to, but that's another story.
Thank you for anyone that responds up till here.

In terms of the educational bit, in case anyone has any insight, I was offered full rides to a few colleges for my academic record and extracurriculars. My father walked out on my family 7 years ago now, and my mother does not have any legal documents, although my two younger, much younger brothers, are citizens. So yes, dirt poor. 

FAFSA rejects me every time I try to make it because my of my mom and my information most likely, and the colleges I contacted last year told me they needed it to make a correct offer for how much they would be willing to help me with. Free community college under this program known as STARS in NJ, although awarded to me based on high SAT and class rank, was also denied because of my status.

My mom has no experience with any of this, and being the oldest I was left to fend for my own. I did not know what to do last year. After the initial response from the colleges I spoke to, most around this area, I refrained from speaking to the ones who offered full rides. I'm not even sure if that was a mistake. I recently reached out to them again. But the let down of what took place as May-June 2014 came along, I withdrew and suffered a minor depression period seeing everything I had acquired be broken down. I understand I need an immigration lawyer and am working  towards set goal.

Strangers behind a screen, i need advice. Any advice. Because I want to go to school and get my education and work the way it was all supposed to happen. Like I said, this past almost year now has been pure hell, one that based on what I was worth and have the accolades for, did not deserve. 

Whatever it takes, I want to turn it all around.

Thank you.",finance,1433046303

personalfinance,I Have a Question about Breakdown of Index Fund Amounts as a New Investor.,"Hello, I have some specific questions about investing in some Vanguard accounts, a little information about me situation:

I’m 28 years old and have a current salary of $78,000. I have no debt and my financial situation is as follows:

* 8 months of expenses Emergency Fund in a credit union money market.

* Approximately $18,000 in my work 401(k) which I contribute 8%

* About $7,000 in cash in checking/savings credit union account
 
* $45,000 in Vanguard funds(account opened in April 2015):
 
		$18,000 in Total Bond Market Index
		$4,500 in Total International Index
		$15,750 in Total Stock Market Index
		$6,750 in Total International Stock Index

The last area is the one I have questions in. I’ll admit I opened the Vanguard account with probably a little less knowledge than I should have. I opened it on some vague advice from a family member and the quick advice Vanguard gives you on their website.  My concern is that I’ve invested too much money into the Bond Indexes. Everything I’m reading says, “Stay out of the bond market, when the Fed raises the interest rate it will drop!”, but also reading “Stay out of the stock markets, it’s due a huge correction!” Should I leave the amounts as is? Or should I rearrange the amounts?

I’m trying not to let emotion run any decisions, but this is my first time investing and I feel a little overwhelmed. Thanks in advance for advice.",finance,1433093486

Here is my situation. I am 29, Work full time in a crappy deadend job and am going to college for my Bachelor's but I start my 2nd semester tomorrow and it'll be about 4 years before I finish and get a decent job. My wife is 28, Works full time as a librarian and is currently in Grad School to get her Masters. I make about 24k a year and my wife currently makes 26k a year. She will be making around 44k per year next summer after she graduates. (Job already ready to go, She will start in July 2016)

Currently all of our bills and expenses add up to about 2800/month.

Car Loan - 440 (Going to try to refinance this loan in July/August and hopefully get a better interest rate than 14.9% which should bring it down some)

Electric - 150

Phone - 325 (Might seem like a lot but we have 4 people on our phone plan and can't remove anyone)

Cable - 175

Conns (Debt) - 200 (Will be paid off in August 2015)

Friend (Debt) - 500 (Will be paid off in December of 2016, Unavoidable Debt that we must pay, Wife is adamant about how much we pay them back every month and won't budge, We have gotten into several arguments about this subject)

Trees - 240

Groceries - 400

Gas - 200

Misc - 200 (Going out to eat, Hanging out with friends, etc. Everything that doesn't fall into another category) This, Gas, and Groceries are what take the biggest hit when we don't have money. Generally these 3 categories end up around 500 for the whole month.


That is all of the bills we are paying out every month. I did not include rent as we use our Financial Aid Money from School to cover our rent. We bring in about 2800 a month after taxes, 401k, medical/dental/vision, etc. As you can see we are barely making it every month. We can't afford to really go out with our friends or enjoy life at all because we never have any money to do anything. My major problem is next year when my wife graduates. We will have to start paying rent every month as my financial aid is not enough to cover rent. (I'm only getting about about 1500 per semester) All of our bills will remain the same minus Conns but we will be adding another 1200$ bill every month. Even with the very nice raise that my wife will receive I still can't manage to make the finances work.

I already work 40 hours a week and go to school full time as well as my wife, So getting a part-time job to supplement our income is really out of the question. I thought about contacting my financial aid office at school to see if there was anything that can be done but I triple checked my fafsa to make sure all my information was entered correctly and it is and I'm still only getting about 2500/semester. My schooling is around 1000$ a semester leaving me with 1500. (I'm taking 3500 in Federal Loans every school year, About 1750 per semester, That's all that they are offering me, Is this right?)

Any help, suggestions, critisms, etc. welcome. Please help me as I feel this financial burden is breaking apart my marriage. :(",finance,1433095401
personalfinance,Should I be more concerned with paying off my credit card or saving money at this point?,"The title is remarkably vague so allow me to explain. I'm a 22 year old college student about to graduate in December. I'm majoring in Political Science with a minor in Humanitarian Affairs. I have no idea where to even begin to look to for job prospects so while I have two on campus jobs, I want to make the most of them. I make about $600 a month; between groceries and gas, I don't spend money a whole lot else. So onto the credit card.

I foolishly got a credit card about a year ago and my bank gave me a $3,000 credit limit. Needless to say it was maxed out within a few weeks. It has a interest rate of 17.99% and my minimum payments are $60, sometimes less. I've never had a problem making payments and frequently pay $100 or more just to negate the interest. To this day, the current balance is $2,687.41. 

About my savings. I've always been really bad about saving money. If I have something in mind I want to save up for I can normally do it, but having a growing, consistent savings account is impossible for me. My past two paychecks I put $50.00 into my savings so I currently have ~$100 saved up. I read stuff in this sub all the time about how important emergency funds are and the importance of saving and I just get freaked out thinking about how I only have $100.00 right now if something bad happens.

So I guess the question is, what should I prioritize my funds towards more, paying off my credit card or building savings? And are there any flaws in my habits that need serious correction? I really appreciate any and all advice",finance,1433100721

personalfinance,Summer Internship is my first job: What's the smart way to use my money (0 expenses),"I'm being paid in the $15-20 an hour ballpark, with forced 40 hours a week (no overtime allowed). Essentially my overall wage will be in the $6000-8000 depending on how many weeks I end up staying.

Here's the catch: I have basically no expenses. I'm lucky enough that my parents cover most things for me so this internship is pure profit for me. Even for my situation after college, my parents will be helping me out a little bit with the initial transition so I won't need an emergency fund immediately. I know it'll be a valuable thing and it will be one of the first things I do, but I don't need it at this moment thanks to my parents' generosity.

**How can I use this money intelligently?** By the way, I'm pretty noob about how taxes are calculated, but I'm pretty sure my taxes will be very low (my parents file me as dependent so no personal exemption but my wage still barely puts me above the federal standard deduction if at all) but I'm not sure exactly how much money I'll have after taxes.",finance,1433107185
personalfinance,Optometrist lookin for student loan advice,"I just graduated school and will be starting a job as an optometrist in July making 100k for the first two years and 120k starting the third year (contract didn't state what pay would be after third year but I think it would def be higher than 120k)

I have ~250k in student Loan debt (~302k including the interest that has already started building) at interest rates between 4.5% - 7.5%.

I am considering the pay as you earn repayment plan or the extended fixed plan. With the extended fixed I figured I would be paying ~2100 a month towards my student loans.  With pay as you earn I would be paying ~1000 a month towards student loans (debt would be forgiven after 20 years but it would be taxable).

Should I just sign up for the pay as you earn plan so that I am locked into a lower monthly payment while paying extra per month on top of that? How does that work? Does the ~1000 a month for PAYE go towards the interest and anything extra paid go towards the principle?
Or should I just pay the ~2100 per month fixed rate. Basically is there any benefit of me using the PAYE repayment plan and paying extra vs just doing he fixed rate?

Also, how much money should I put in my 401k per month based on my debt and salary? I want to start saving for retirement ASAP.

I currently do not have any CC debt, my car is payed off (who knows how much longer it will last though haha), will be paying around 400-800 a month in rent.

personalfinance,Need advice on trading in my vehicle. Worth adding more debt?,"I currently drive a 2011 Kia Forte Koup SX. My credit was not the greatest when I purchased the vehicle, and honestly it was a dumb decision to buy it in the first place. I took $2k in negative equity on the kia from a trade in, and had a 13% interest rate. 72 month loan at $385 per month. After 6mo of payments, I refinanced and got a 6.5% APR with a local credit union. I still owe 12500 on the vehicle. It's been beat up a bit, and when I appraise it on Edmunds I receive a trade in estimate of 7000 at the most. If I wanted to make the car look great, it'd cost me $2000 easily in repair work.

I'm currently being offered $12500 trade in on my Kia towards a 2015 Chrysler 200 S. After rebates, it's $23500. 72 Month loan, with 2.6% APR. I'll be paying the same monthly payment.

It's an attractive deal. That car is a lot more car than what I have currently. I also have been really wanting 4 doors. The issue of course is that I am adding on another 2-3 years of paying ~$350 a month, when I could have this paid off in 2 years and put the month towards student loans.

personalfinance,Many letters from student loan requesting I sign an affirmation of consolidation,"I have a student loan with American Education Services. The loan was disbursed around 2000 or 2004. I don't remember much about these particular loans (whether it was for undergrad or grad, if/when I actually did consolidate something). I have been paying on this loan for several years, and there has never been a problem.....until around 2 years ago. 

I received a letter requesting my signature. They wanted me to sign an affirmation of consolidation. The letter stated that signature was voluntary, so I tossed it.

However, every month since then, another letter has shown up! 
 I attached photos of the letters below. Here is some of the text:

""By signing this letter, you are not altering the terms or conditions of your promissory note. And, although you are not required to sign the document, your participation is appreciated.

""I, the undersigned, acknowledge that I completed and signed a consolidation loan application and promissory note to consolidate my student loan debt into a federal consolidation loan. In accordance with my request, the consolidation lender consolidated the following loans.

My federal consolidation loan is currently owned by Brazzers/US Bank National. By signing this document I affirm that all the loans listed above were to be included in my federal consolidation loan disbursed on 1/28/2004.""

My interpretation of these letters (which, again, have been sent once a month for 2+ years) is that they probably lost my signature on a document. Does that sound right?

I am a person who pays his debts. However, I reluctantly admit that I've been tempted to dispute the debt or something. Can anyone comment on what these letters mean?

The application process was really simple, and the only income I listed was about $2400 from a summer job that I do. (Plus I have no credit). Also, they never asked for a parent co-sign, and the only thing they needed documentation for was proof of college enrollment. I was accepted in like 2 days and received my card in 3.

gaming,[Story] I've been playing the same Football Manager save for almost 5 years and still haven't won the World Cup. This is my story...,"Gather round ladies and gentlemen and hear my story. A story of ups, downs, thrills and spills. One spanning from 2010 to 2015 in real life but an epic that runs from year 2010 to 2040 in game time. This is my Football manager story, in which I've been  playing the same game and the same save for almost 5 years and have failed to win the World Cup, despite 5 attempts and counting. 

Despite this being a story of international affairs, I'll start by giving a brief overview of my domestic story as it is a fulcrum to the whole narrative. From the years 2010 to 2026 I turned Sunderland from mid-table minnows to the greatest team the world has ever seen. Onwards from 2015, I won both the premier league and champions league every year until my resignation in 2026. In the 2020/21 season, Sunderland managed to score over [150 goals](https://i.imgur.com/9KzPJrH.png) with my three strikers, Fabinho, Fabinho Jr and [Hernandez](http://i.imgur.com/1t1Rspf.png) managing to score over 30 goals each and my defender Hulk exploiting the near post corner tactic with 28 goals. My midfield maestro [Markovic](http://i.imgur.com/ozzVmEE.png) consistently got over 20 assists each season, reaching a zenith in 2024 with 56 assists. Why is all this relevant? My team was essentially Brazilian as I recruited young talent and transformed them into global superstars before they reached the age of 21. [Eight of my starting XI were Brazilian: Fabinho, Fabinho Jr, Hulk, Fabio Souto, Rodrigues, Marcelo, Bento and Beto](http://imgur.com/a/9EQLu). As I was essentially managing Brazil at a domestic level, I was eager to become the actual Brazil manager as soon as possible so I could fully harness the ability of Fabinho and co, leading them to glory. Nevertheless, it must noted that originally the World Cup was never the final goal. It was only after achieving an unbeaten season in 2022 that club football merely became a 4 year filibuster. In essence, I was dominant at club level: could I transfer this to an international level? 

My first, reluctant venture into international management was with the nation the Republic of Ireland in 2012. This spell has nothing noteworthy to mention as I quit a year later. Ultimately it was a stepping stone to a bigger nation - I’m sorry Shane Long but you were terrible. I waited eagerly for a top nation’s manager to either get sacked or resign, applying for many jobs and seldom getting it. It was only in 2014, after the World Cup, that Fabio Capello retired and the FA finally looked my way after finishing an impressive second in the premier league. I easily qualified for the the 2016 European championships with Wayne Rooney banging in the goals and flew through the group stages with ease. The last 16 promised tournament glory for us as we defeated Holland 4-0! A hattrick for Rooney followed by a goal by Ashley Young would’ve even got the now pessimistic English media excited about our chances. However in typical English fashion, we were defeated to Spain in the quarter finals 2-0. Nevertheless, this was my first big tournament, with a big nation and with big players (sorry Shane) and I had performed fine. By 2017, I had once again swept my qualification group and for the first time in my career, I had my eyes firmly on the World Cup. Despite this, with the growing presence of Fabinho for Sunderland my eyes diverted to South America, hoping that the Brazil job would open up. A doorway did open in October 2017, although rather than yellow it was the next best thing: Argentine blue.

I couldn’t manage the upcoming Fabinho, who had just been voted second in the Ballon d'or, so instead I managed the guy who came first: Lionel Messi. By the time the tournament came around Messi had reached the tender age of 31 and hence his stats had began to falter. Nonetheless, he was still a world class player and alongside Sergio Aguero my strikeforce was looking rather formidable. Indeed, during the group stage it showed with 15 goals scored and only one conceded. This was surely my time. For the second round knockout I was drawn against rivals Uruguay who also had the fairly prolific strikeforce of Cavani and Abel Hernandez (not to be confused with the aforementioned Hernandez who plays for Sunderland). At half time I was leading 1-0, dominating possession and the game as a whole. The next part is hazy and the only evidence for the match is this [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/upenf.jpg) Either way, I ended the match with significantly less players than Uruguay. Why? In my hubris I had used my 3 substitutions either before or just after the Messi injury at the 50th minute. Thus I was playing with 8 or 7 men depending on when i used my substitutions. However, leading 2-0 I felt strangely confident. If I could turn Sunderland into a mammoth, surely I could overcome 2 red cards and 2 injuries… right? In typical football manager fashion, my 26 shots meant nothing as Uruguay scored a last minute goal in extra time to prevent even the slightest glimmer of hope through a penalty shoot out. I was devastated. I even considered restarting the game but I couldn’t bring myself to it; although I did post the event on Reddit in December 2011: http://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/nlaw0/i_wanted_to_restart_this_match_so_badly/ 
/u/whocarestom commented: “What a heartbreaker.” 
Trust me tom, it gets worse.

After this catastrophic defeat, I quit. I knew Argentina were going to go through a transitional phase, as I could see their upcoming youth couldn’t match the talents of Messi and Aguero, so I bailed. Once again, I hoped for a Brazil sacking but naturally the manager was enjoying the fruits of my Sunderland success, coming runners up against shock winners Russia.It’s worth noting that just before the World Cup I had signed a 17 year old Russian CB called Emil Niftaliyev for 6k. Bizarrely, he was called up and played every game. Unlike me, he had won the world cup on his first attempt. My jealously had a reached an apogee. 

Just as I had in 2017, rather than getting Brazil, I got the next best thing. France had finished in third place in the World Cup of 2018 and looked a fine choice to lead to glory. I swept the qualifiers for the Euros 2020 and easily reached the Semi Finals. It was there I faced arguably the second best striker in the world, Giuseppe Parisi. I would later sign him for 80 million for Sunderland (Don’t give me that look, I had millions to spend and as previously mentioned, club football became a bore). Here’s his [stats in 2023](http://i.imgur.com/K1jWyY9.png) 
After taking the lead, Italy pegged me back with pacey Parisi leading the charge. I eventually lose but now, after seeing Italy in action, they become my next target to manage. After losing in the final, their manager left and thus I pounced. Surely Parisi would lead me to victory in 2022. In hindsight, the France job seemed like a waste of time with my only real success being the transformation of Cedric Bakamba into a [goal scoring god](http://i.imgur.com/ewyAMqp.png)
It goes without saying that I dominated the qualifying groups, with Parisi essentially unstoppable. I had found the perfect striker for my tactic, and thus I decided to sign him for Sunderland at the beginning of the 2021 season to ensure he was not injured for 2022. Fabinho still dominated for both club and country scoring 68 goals in all competitions in the 2021-22 season. However my longing for Brazil had been negated by the presence of Parisi. This time around I only edged through the group stages. 2 draws and a win led me to doubt. Maybe it just wasn’t to be. Despite this falter, I had a surprisingly easy route to the semi-finals beating both Belgium and Bosnia. I thought the same about the semis when I saw who I had been drawn. England. My former team and heavily reliant on their star right winger - I should’ve walked over them. A tense game where neither team could break the deadlock. Then, in the 90th minute [this happened](https://streamable.com/nvf0)

An own goal by my keeper. 90+3
Devastated

Denial

For a week I didn’t touch the game, and even contemplated ruining Ivan Peretti’s career by signing him for 5 years and not playing him, nor allowing him to train. To this day, I regret not following through on that. To make it worse, I’m one of his favoured personnel.

A story of ups, downs, thrills and spills. 
Ivan peretti jumps up, the ball drops down, the thrill is dead all due to that spill.

A light at the end of the tunnel, a yellow one. The Brazil manager finally retires, surely this is it. Without thinking I apply and immediately receive the job. I mean, who wouldn’t want the most successful manager in the world? On the flip side, who would want a manager who chokes in every world cup? After viewing the squad everything looked grand...except their age. By the time of the 2026 world cup, I calculated that: Fabinho and Rodrigues would be 32 whilst Beto would be past it at 34. Other crucial members of the squad were also aging, but surely I could squeeze something out of them? My worries were dispersed when I [went unbeaten for three years](http://i.imgur.com/Q2j8ew8.png). Winning the Copa America and the Confederations cup with Fabinho beating Pele’s goal scoring record. Sweeping through the group stages I was drawn Senegal in the second round knockout. A breeze...or not. My hubris, once again, led to making three subs in the 57th minute, even before I was leading. Fabinho popped up in the 67th minute, however an injury to Parana (another sunderland player) in the 71st led me to playing with 10 men. Albeit nothing compared to the disaster of 2018, this led to my downfall. Losing 4-2 AET.

The dream was dead.
I couldn’t take it anymore
I had to win the World Cup
I quit Sunderland and Brazil and took over England.
Holidayed to the Euros.
Won the Euros 2028.
Holidayed to the confederations cup
Lost in semi finals, don’t care. World cup is the goal.
Holidayed to the World Cup 2030.
This time, I made a squad selection error. Despite my tactic playing with 3 strikers, I only called up 4 strikers. Two get injured and suspended, so I’m left with 2 strikers and a LB up front. Somehow I manage to win all my group games and it is in the second round, once more, that I falter. I play Serbia, their star player is Markovic, the Sunderland assist god. Markovic was originally German however as I forgot to delete the file that prevents Germany from receiving real players (copyright issues), he never got called up. I hoped that he would one day turn to Serbia and eventually he did. In a cruel twist of irony, he levelled the game in the 120th minute to make the game 2-2 and take it penalties. We all know England’s history with penalties… need I say more?

This time, I had had enough. I quit England and RETIRED the manager of Mark Dean. 
I needed a fresh start and took over Wealdstone in 2030, the worst team in Blue the Square South. Eventually obtaining promotion to the premier league in 2037, I saw a premier league that had vastly changed. Sunderland were no longer dominant, losing their 19 win year streak in 2034, after selling future youth prospects away, only keeping Leo the brazilian striker and heir to Fabinho’s throne (eventually beating his Brazilian goal scoring record). Half way through my first season, I get two notifications: Uruguay manager sacked. Peru manager sacked. Peru could still qualify for the World Cup through the playoffs, however I knew I wasn’t going to win it with him. I qualified and got knocked out in the group stages. Although this time I had little expectation and was merely using Peru almost like I did in 2012 with Ireland (sorry not sorry Shane). I’m in the year 2040 now and have not got an international job, but the World Cup is very much the final goal.
