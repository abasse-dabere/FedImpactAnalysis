personalfinance,What is the point of credit unions when normal banks offer better interest rates?,"Quick fact about me: I recently got hired as an SI instructor. SI stands for Supplement Instruction and as a SI Coach I help students review and study for the test. Anyways, apparently, even if you are a student worker, you count as school employee and is eligible for the California Credit Union.

I've checked the accounts, credit cards, and other bank related things the union offers and they don't seem very enticing. The interest rates are really low. Alley has far better rates.

I already strongly recommended she get a credit card, what else could help her get a less insane interest rate, and who would be good option for a refinance that would take into account her salary/understand why her credit score is lowish.

personalfinance,(AUS) Can somebody please do the math.,"Hello,

Chasing some answers/advice on this please guys and gals. 

Situation, my partner and I have the following debts, a personal loan originally for $15200 @13% over 4 years. Making the repayments on that $210 p/fn. There is currently $8200 left on that and 27 months remaining.  We have finance on another thing originally 15000 over 7 years @13.8. Repayments on that are $140 p/fn, there is still $9300 an still about 24 months remaining. 

Now, my partner has just started a new job we her employer lets her use $9010 of pre-tax salary (approx $430 dollars p/fn) that she can put towards any personal loans and they will pay this fortnightly and fully reimburse her a few days later. The problem here is, her name is not on the personal loan so they have said a way around this is to refinance the loan with her name added to it. This is where we were thinking of consolidating the personal loan and the other loan and taking out a new loan of approx $17000 and taking advantage of her salary package that she gets meaning at the end of the day, it is not really coming out of our pockets? 

Does this make sense? and is it a good idea? I haven't enquired yet as to whether the interest rate on the new loan would be lower but I think it will because we now have a car we can use to secure the loan.

I'm a 22 year old college student finishing up university this fall &amp; I'd like to be free of all my debt (aside from student loans) before I leave school. Money isn't something I really talk about with my parents but i'm currently still living at home so cost of living isn't really a factor.

Current I'm working a pretty good internship that is guaranteed for at least the end of summer but I'm hoping to extend into the semester so that I can pay off all of my debt! 

So the numbers!

Total Debt:  (9,515.17)

Spread across 3 sources, 2 credit cards and 1 car loan.

Credit Card 1 - (1,081.53) w/ APR - 17.99%

Credit Card 2 - (2,091.02) w/ APR - 22.99%

Car Loan - (6,342.62) w/ Interest Rate - 11.49%

At my internship I make $22.50 an hour which nets me $706.12 a week after taxes. I also have started to drive Uber when I can to make additional income! I estimate i may be able to bring in at least an extra $100 - $200 a month doing this.

What I'm hoping you all can help me do is come up with the best strategy for paying this off. After joining the sub i'd spent a few months and actually paid off my first credit card but unfortunately fell back in the hole because of irresponsibility.

personalfinance,"Pay down car, or downgrade and tack on the loan balance?","Hello all,

I am in what I consider an interesting auto issue. Back when I was younger, my concept of money was different. I have always had nice cars, and managed to keep paying them with money to spare. Fortunately, I have been on my 2 year short journey towards Financial Independence, and have managed to live off a large salary spending an absolute fraction of my total income and saving the rest.

To get to the guts: I will use worse case numbers so I can get as real possible.

I currently own a BMW 335xi. Worth, now, on kbb around ~$10k, Monthly payments at $290/month, 2.99% Interest Rate. I have payed down 10 payments, and reduced the total loan from its original $18,900 down to ~$16,500 in this time. I spend 95$ per oil change, about every 2.5 months, and currently fill off 15 gallons of premium gas (Currently 3.19/gallon) ~54$ per tank, 1x a week. 

I allow a family member to driver her to work every day, as my round trip is 80 miles and theirs is 14. My daily driver is a Town and Country mini van, 135k miles, ~58$ per tank, 1x a week. Worth $4k, and needs $1k future maintenance to be fully running. ($5k total cost)

BMW Summary
Worth:10k
Owe(Buy Out): $16,500 ($290 per month) (Loan Balance)
Gas cost: $216/month
Maintenance:475 per year @ 95 per 2.5 months = 39.58/month
Future Cost: $1k to get tires end of this year + any maintenance costs

Van summary
Worth: 4k
Owe (Buy Out): $4k
Gas Cost: 236/month
Maintenance: 210 per year @ 35 per 2 months = 17.5/month
Future Cost: $1k to get it fully up and running + any maintenance costs


Now my question lies in what to do. I am looking to spend down $8k into whatever decision works best here. We will say gas is about the same. My 2 choices remain:

1. put down 8k into van, buy it for $5k with 3k left over. By selling my BMW for $10k, I will have 6500 loan remaining, so total price of van would be (5k van purchase price from dad+ 6500 remaining loan balance on bmw after sale) No more payments, only pay 35$ oil changes x 2 months and no estimated big repair expense that usually packs on to sudden issues with bmw = $11500 + oil changes

2. Put down 8k into bmw, with remaining loan balance being approximately 8000. I would now lower my 290 payment to 109.99/month (saving ~190/month to do wise with) I have a full warranty that will protect me for only one more year, then im on my own. I will continue 95$ 2.5 months oil changes, and need tires coming up end of this year looking at 1k$ extra. (Lets call it 9k left on loan after adding new tires and say payment is equivalent to 125/month factoring this in)

I love my BMW, in fact it was my dream car growing up. Same model, package, everything and I waited a long time to find it at an auction. I detail it every week, I mean it truly is my pride and joy. The van though, shes a beast and always reliable. Shes like a fat pig that i use as a horse, Ugly disgusting and embarrassing but cheap and gets the job done. I have also looked into more affordable cars, such as Camry ford focus etc but found that I will still have this BMW loan balance upon me, which makes it tough. (Those are still options if someone knows something that I do not) Yes, if I could do it all over again I would have bought a $5-6000 car, payed it off and been done with it.

Genuinely, I appreciate the advise, suggestions. I have been coding a program to project for me long term costs, overall costs etc but as I am doing so with learning a new language progress is slow. Reddit has always helped for things like this, neat to see it work. I apologize for the typos and length. Did it all on my phone.

A little background. I am a 22 yo male who will be starting medical school this fall. I have no student loans and will not be taking any out for medical school. In addition, my Grandparents will be paying for my living expenses during school. 

My main question for you all is how I should allocate my money so that I can see conservative growth over the next 5 years. This excludes my personal Roth which I obviously wont touch for a while. 

Now, as far as my finances:


I have $9000 in a savings account. I would like to keep about $1500 of this free for unplanned expenses while in medical school. The rest I would like to invest so that I see all of it back + &gt; inflation growth by the time I am a doctor in 5 years. I was looking into a CD, but the interest rates are so low their has to be a better option. 

I have $5500 that I invested into a Roth through Fiidelity's Contrafund last summer and it has since grown to $6,226 as of this morning. 

I also have an additional $40,879 invested in Fidelity. Of this $7,150 is in Berkshire Hathaway stocks and the other $33,728.99 is invested in the Baird Aggregate Bond Fund. 

I want to know what I should do with the $7500 I was to save and touch in 5 years. In addition, what are your thoughts on my roth and Fidelity investment decisions? 

You are probably all wondering where I got this money so I'll just disclose that now. About half was inherited and the rest was saved during the last two years as I have been working 3/4 time as I finish up college.

At nearly $1.2 trillion, the number of outstanding student debt eclipses all of the types of household debt except house mortgages. Yet while interest levels on home loans and other common forms of debt have fallen over the previous few years, allowing millions of borrowers to refinance into less expensive costs, understudy obligation can be about troublesome to refinance, federal government regulators possess said.

Rohit Chopra, Client Financial Safety Bureau college student mortgage ombudsman, described in response to issues at a panel conversation Wednesday that Given plans to engineer lower interest rates over the economy have not necessarily helped borrowers with student personal debt.

The acknowledgement may gas endeavours in Congress and within the united states wide authorities to spotlight households fighting scholar personal personal debt burdens with ways of refinance their loans as Washington policymakers begin to comprehend right now there are limits to the Fed’s endeavours, officials stated. The Fed has nearly single-handedly propped up the U.S. overall economy by reducing borrowing costs as financial authorities got decreased spending and elevated taxes.

I understand that interest rates on savings accounts are laughably abysmal, but I still have difficulty crossing that hurdle of letting my money float on the market. When is the right time to enter the market? Should I wait for a crash? Wouldn't that guarantee the greatest return?

What would help is some direction on how to get started on Vanguard, and what to invest in given my current situation. I've seen many people talk about using Vanguard, but when I visit the website I'm overwhelmed by the number of options.

personalfinance,Is it wise to take a student loan forbearance yet make the standard payments?,"My wife and I have ~$170k in student loans that are entering repayment this year. We will be able to put $2500/month towards them and want to maximize our interest savings. About $115k of the balance is eligible for a residency forbearance, but to take it would negate the automatic payment rate reduction (0.25%). 

We already plan to do extended fixed repayment, yet pay the standard 10-year repayment amounts (or more as we can). Will we save even more by taking the forbearance while continuing to pay the 10-year repayment amounts? This would leave us with only a few minimum payments and let us tackle the higher-interest loans more aggressively. 

Also, by the end of my grace period (in 6 months), I estimate I will have ~$12k in uncapitalized interest. Is there any benefit to paying off the uncapitalized interest (to avoid compounding), or should all payments be targeted to the highest interest rate loan regardless?

###Loan details:

**Me (eligible for forbearance):** 

* $65,275 @ 6.8% 
* $30,495 @ 5.41%
* $8,500 @ 5.25%

personalfinance,"Is there a calculator or easy formula for the ""take a mortgage or pay cash"" question?","From a purely monetary standpoint, it may be reasonable to take a mortgage instead of paying cash for a house, if the expected rate of investment return exceeds the cost of the mortgage (interest and fees).

The interest portion of that equation is simple, since the principal is irrelevant: if the average rate of investment return is greater than the mortgage interest rate, then at the end of the mortgage term, the buyer will ultimately have more money by taking the loan and investing the extra cash, no matter how big the loan is.

But there are two confounding factors: flat fees associated with the loan (i.e. closing costs), and the potential to sell early and pay off the loan at a point where most of the interest has already been paid (because amortization results in front-loading the interest) but the invested amount hasn't had enough time to generate returns to offset those interest payments.

Is there an online calculator that can account for these factors? Or does someone know the equation to calculate the minimum average investment return in order to break even, given the loan principal, fees, interest rate, expected (amortized) term, and actual duration (in case of paying off early)?",finance,1433180271

Right now I have about $27,000 ish in my checking account.  But no matter how much I have, I don't want to go much below that number.  So right now, if I had $25,000 in my account, I look at it as if I have $0.

That amount is more than enough for a six month emergency fund, as well as a $1000 unexpected expense fund.  My job is secure, but I guess I still look at it as what if I was laid off today?  I'd want as much money as possible.

I guess in that type of situation I'd be forced to spend it.  But it seems like if I am not in a forced situation, I don't want my account to drop below X amount.  The problem is that X amount keeps growing as my account grows.

I could pay off my student loans, which total about $15,000.  But the interest rates are all less than 3.75% (3.75, 3.25 and 2.5) So I don't mind making payments on those, since the interest rates are so low.  I have started the snowball process on these though.

I guess my situation isn't that bad of a one to be in.  But it's still a bit frustrating to always think you have $0 in your account, when in reality you have over $25k.",finance,1433182585

If the exact amounts are important I can list them all here, but this is more just for general strategy advice, seeing as I won't be making payments for another year.

I have decent grades, 3.3 GPA. Double major in Political Science and Sociology-Criminology, hopefully opening more doors as far as a career goes than just a sociology degree would. I have a 4.0 in my poli sci major and I hope to keep it that way, would be a nice talking point during an interview.

My **goal** for this year is to keep my grades as  high as possible, hopefully graduating *cum laude*, find a job, then **refinance my loans through SoFi** or something similar. So, I'll want to have as high of a credit score as possible. Is there anything I could be doing/am missing?

What Do I Do With It?!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics).  Odds are you will find *something* in there that applies to you, and will answer any basic questions you have.

* For specifics on retirement accounts, you may find [Your IRA and You: Basic Information](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras) and [Your 401k and You: Basic Information](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k) worth a read as well.  If you're a federal employee or military member, take a look at [Your TSP and You: Basic Information](http://redd.it/2bbn7n)).

* There is a [reading list](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/readinglist) in our FAQ that contains analog (and reasonably more complete) versions of the information found in the FAQ.

* This year's graduating class is the [most indebted ever](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/05/08/congratulations-class-of-2015-youre-the-most-indebted-ever-for-now/).  If you are dealing with debt, please see the [FAQ entry on Debt](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt).  Remember - debt is just like any other tool that can be good or bad depending on how it's used.  Hopefully your education was a good use of debt.

* We have an entire section of the FAQ devoted to [Credit](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index#wiki_credit).  While building credit is important, it's equally important to [keep things in perspective](http://redd.it/2q3ba7).

* While managing your finances by yourself for the first time may seem intimidating, you probably don't need a [financial advisor](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/financialadvisors).  If you decide to pay someone to manage your money for you, ensure they are a **fee-only**, fiduciary advisor or planner that offers counsel that is in your best interest, not theirs.

Finally, if you still have a question about your financial situation, it's very helpful to ask them in a way that demonstrates you have read [""I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) or the applicable section of the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq) and why your situation is special.  This signals to people who respond that you've actually put some thought into your post, and will more than likely garner a more useful response.

personalfinance,Save for new home or pay off auto?,"My wife and I purchased a new car (for her) about 3 months ago and we are trying to decide between making extra payments on the note or saving for a down payment on a new home. I am aware of the general opinion of new vehicles on this sub, but we both have driven our vehicles for a long time (she her old car for 12 years, and wasn't nice to start with).

Relevant financial info:
I am 29 and she is 28.
The car loan is for ~$34,000 over 5 years at 2.7% interest rate for a payment of around $610/mo.  
Current mortgage payment including interest (4% w/ PMI), taxes, and insurance is $1200/mo. Outstanding principal is around $130k and similar homes in the neighborhood are selling for around $180-190k.  
No other debt obligations at the moment.  
Other household bills run about $780/mo.  
Food and entertainment vary widely month to month but probably run about $1000/mo combined.  
Two credit cards with a max line of $22,000 between them. We use them to purchase most everything (points!) but pay them off in full each month.  
Reserve fund currently is at around $12k in liquid assets.  
Retirement funds currently around $50k between 401k and a roth IRA. Currently saving 10% per month after company match.  
Gross earnings between the both of us is ~$125k/year. This after taxes and whatnot we generally have about $7100/mo in take home pay.  
After other various expenses in a month we usually have between $2000-$2500 available to save at the end of a month.  

We are wanting to move to a bigger house closer to both of our workplaces at some point down the line, but we can't decide if we should save everything towards the new house or pay off the car loan a couple of years early.
The house price we would be targeting would be $300k-$350k and we would like to rent our current home out instead of selling if we don't have to. Just looking for some general advice on where the best place to but the extra money would be... thanks!",finance,1433187702
personalfinance,Using Federal Student Loans to pay off Private Student Loans?,"I believe I've found a loophole in the system and would like to know if what I'm thinking about doing is somehow a terrible idea for reasons I'm not thinking of. 

I'm currently in grad school half-time while working full-time. I'm eligible for $20,500 per year in stafford loans. I don't need all this, only about $8000 per year to cover tuition. My income covers my living expenses obviously.

I have about $30k of private loans outstanding from undergrad on top of some federal loans. I'm considering using the extra stafford loan money to pay off the private loans. I could pay off one of them right away and significantly pay down another by the time I'm done with school.

Here's my thinking:
1. The benefits that come with federal loans over private loans
2. I work in the public sector and will qualify for income based repayment when I finish grad school (I was on it before I started grad school). So PSLF means even though I'm taking on more federal debt, the amount I repay will NOT change. Thus I'm saving tons of money by getting rid of as much of the private loans as I can and doing it this way.

I know I'm just transferring debt and not paying it off, but I will have my federal debt forgiven tax-free after 10 years. With the field I'm in and the amount of debt I have my IBR doesn't even cover interest right now so it's highly unlikely I'll ever come close to paying these off. Is there something I'm not thinking of here? If it's completely stupid and a terrible idea please let me know and tell me why.",finance,1433188481
personalfinance,Question about borrowing on margin,"I'm getting slightly confused researching because most questions and therefore answers I see are related to borrowing on margin and then reinvesting. For the sake of this question let us assume I understand the following:
 
&amp;nbsp;

*I can borrow up to 50% of my current stock value.  
*If at any time my stock value dips, I would be required to pay the difference to ensure the line of credit stays at 50% or less.  
*There is a 2% interest rate on loans under 100k. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

With that being said, I own approximately $170k worth of stock. My stockbroker told me that I qualify for a margin loan up to 50%. However, I only need approximately 20k as startup for a new business. She approached me with this because I called requesting information about liquidating stock since I know my credit is too bad (crazy exes - but since been taken care of) to apply for a traditional loan at a reasonable rate. My question is whether I'm missing some glaringly obvious reason that this is a bad idea.

personalfinance,"$3600 debt with a 24% APR. I've been approved for a balance transfer card, but I'm wondering what the best next step is.","**Background:** 23 year old making $29000 year. I got 2 credit cards a few years ago to establish my credit. For about a year and a half, I paid my balance in full every month and on time. However, a year ago when my girlfriend and I moved into our own place, I racked up a bit on one of the cards by buying things for our first house. 


**My problem:** I've got pretty (very) high utilization on my Capital One card. ($3600 out of a $4000 limit) and an obscene interest rate of 24%. As of about an hour ago, I was approved for a Chase Slate card with a $2000 limit. A few of the perks were the 0% transfer fees, and 0% APR for 15 months.

**My plan:** Is currently to transfer about $1500 of the debt to the new card and pay down the remaining $2100 on the Capital One card. 

**My question(s):** Could/Should I consider applying for another balance transfer card to relieve myself of as much of the 24% interest as possible? Especially since my last ""hard inquiry"" was about an hour ago and if I apply quickly would maybe avoid pulling another hard inquiry? Ideally, I would love to have all of the $3600 split between two 0% interest cards and pay them off equally over the next few months.


I net about $440/week with $60 going into a recently opened savings account. Should I cut that out and spend the money on paying down the debt? Or continue to put money away for an emergency fund?

personalfinance,Revisiting mortgage vs investment: What rate of return would you need for investment to be better than paying off your mortgage early?,"A coworker of mine recently shared this article with me.
http://www.thesimpledollar.com/where-does-7-come-from-when-it-comes-to-long-term-stock-returns/

Like many others, it touches on the idea that you might be able to get more for your money by investing it rather than paying off your mortgage. In the past, I've heard people simply state that their rate of return in the market is greater than their mortgage rate, but they never mention how tax and inflation come into play.

For a given interest rate, how do you calculate the rate of return you would need in order for investing to be a better idea? I suppose you would also need to specify other values as well, such as average rate of inflation.

Additionally, is there something to be said about the stability of your mortgage rate over 30 years vs the volatility of the market? It is easy to get a great return from the market now, but there is bound to be a point in time over the next 30 years when that is not the case.",finance,1433196716

Quick bio:

26 years old, making about 2500 / month after tax.

* ~3.5k (1) credit card (~17%)
* ~ 14k student loan (spread out between 4.5%, 6.8%, and 3.4%)
* ~ 6k left on car

total is about 32,500 give or take.

monthly expenses:

* $300 - Health insurance 
* $632 Car payment 
* currently parents pay for my phone and car insurance


I'm currently deferred my students as they have the lowest interest rates so I'm trying to focus on getting rid of those high APR credit cards. I also moved back in with my parents and currently pay 500 dollars for rent fortunately (this is in relation to housing costs in silicon valley). 



Now, I know the health insurance and car payments seem high but hear me out. I need the expensive plan due to the back surgery I had done last year and some other medications I need)
The car I had taken over for my parents which works out because they agreed to let me have it if I finish the payments on it (had about 9k left, now down to 6k now).



Let me know if any of these plans would be ideal for me, or if there are any other plans that exist out there.

1st I want to sell the car as I only agreed to take it over because there was only a fourth of the amount left and it was too good of a deal to refuse. I can probably sell it for around 16k right now so I have some disposable income to work with. I plan on paying it off first then selling via private party. This car is worth too much right now, and too expensive to justify me owning it at this time of my life (it's a lexus is250) when I'm currently in debt.

Would it be a good idea to use the money I have from selling the car to pay off both of my credit cards and then just having my loan to worry about? Ideally I'd like to sell it and pick up something much more cost efficient and cheaper since this car will only depreciate in value.",finance,1433197625

personalfinance,"About to finish medical school, wedding on the horizon.","First post ever, so be kind.

I suppose what I'm looking for here is from  financial advice. I have a feeling what I'm doing is already silly but maybe I need some strangers on the internet to tell me that.

Just for back ground, I'm finishing up my final year of medical school, graduating May 2016. After medical school, all new grads have to go to residency, comparable to an extended internship. I'm engaged to the girl of my dreams and also getting married in the same month, May 2016. 

I somehow managed to do extremely well in medical school, and multiple advisers have told me I'm likely a shoo-in for a very competitive specialty that, after residency, makes on average 350k a year. Granted, it's dependent on location and years of experience but I can absolutely expect 200k+ right out of residency. For my chosen specialty, I can expect 5 years of residency making approximately 50k a year.

My fiancee has done great financially as well. She'll finish up a masters next year and is currently working full time as a chemist making approximately 60k a year. She bought a house 3 years ago (which we live in together) and we're renting the two spare bedrooms to local college students.

Now for the financial background. For the sake of simplicity, I'll combine some of our financial issues even though were legally haven't joined accounts yet.
  
Debt:  
College : 30k (Combined)  
Car: 6k (Her)  
House : 120k  
Medical School: 240k (5.8-8.0% interest rates)  
No additional personal debt.  
    
Income:    
Her: 60k  
Renters: 12k  
Me: Currently getting 26k/yr living expenses, can expect 50k/yr 2016-2021, 200k++ onwards.  

Here's my questions I guess:  
  
1) We both want a great wedding - not over the top, but something people will remember and have a great time at. Its also the last time I'll see many of my school friends before we go separate ways. Current estimates put the wedding + honeymoon at around 26k total. We're expecting maybe 6k in contributions from the family. We think this is reasonable and seems like a drop in the bucket on top of all the rest of the debt we have. We would have to take out additional loans to make this happen.

2) Another issue that we've been struggling with is my fiancee is she very insecure about her breasts. I love her just the same, but subjectively she is lacking in that department. She's currently an AA, and wants a B cup for the wedding. It's something that been bothering her for awhile and I think it's fair for some cosmetic surgery before we get immortalized in the wedding photos. She's seen a local surgeon and current estimates our around 6k out the door. Same as before, is this a completely ridiculous investment right now? She has the funds to pay for half now and the other half interest free over a year through a payment plan system she has through her work.

personalfinance,How I negotiated with Sallie Mae/Navient to save $100K on my student loans,"I've been a longtime lurker in PF, and my story might be of interest or use to others who were in my position. (I defaulted on my private loans due to unemployment circa 2010, like a lot of people during the recession.) Anyway, the tl;dr is that I was able to negotiate a $100K reduction in my private loans. I paid the settlement over almost exactly four years.

The numbers:

- Starting balance: $144,586
- Paid: $45,898
- Reduction of $98,688

As of today, my credit report says ""Account legally paid in full for less than the full balance"" for all Sallie Mae/Navient accounts.

It took a lot of patience and perseverance, and no small number of headaches. There are things I would do differently today, if I could--like trying harder to get documentation up front, if possible--the trouble with student loans is that the relationship is so asymmetric. That said, negotiation may be possible if you've defaulted on your private loans. (Not with federal, alas.)

The full story (with images and screenshots) is here:
http://rianjs.net/2015/06/how-to-negotiate-with-sallie-mae-navient

I'm happy to answer any questions, but the philosophy I went in with was to prefer debt retirement by any means possible over credit scores. That said, my score went from ~490 to 733 in those four years, even though a big chunk of my debts were settled, so those two things aren't mutually exclusive.

So I threw as much money as I could at the card each month, and I finally paid it off and opened up a savings account this month!!!!!!

I called the bank to lower my interest rate, but they only pulled it down to 17%. I have a good credit score (750+) and make a good wage, but I have a lot of student dent and still feel like this is high. I don't intend to use the card much and I'm currently working on building my savings as well as paying down my student debt. 

So should I try to get another card with a lower interest rate and cut this one up? Or should I just leave it be and only use it strategically?",finance,1433209001
personalfinance,Estate Tax &amp; Family to Business Loans,"I have a few questions about the Estate Tax and Family/Business Loans that I hope someone can help answer for me.

Situation:
My business partner and I own a real estate LLC that purchases condos and houses and rents them out.  Let’s call it “New Estates LLC”.  

My father has his own LLC for strictly funding projects and making loans.  Let’s call it “EG Funding LLC”.  My Father is the only owner, however, I am also a signer on the bank accounts.

Through my father, EG Funding LLC loans New Estates LLC $1,000,000.

Terms of Loan: 5% Interest Only note over 7 years unless negotiated further.  Also within the promissory note’s terms is a clause that says the borrower can repay the loan early without any penalties.

New Estates LLC has a note that is over the AFR interest rate and has a schedule for when to pay interest and and when to pay back the loan.

Continuing with this example, let’s say that New Estates LLC negotiates with EG Funding LLC and the promissory note length changes to a 30 year note.

In a freak accident, both my parents pass away.  

As I understand it, as long as there is a promissory note in place, interest above the AFR rate, a schedule of repayment, and a due date, the estate tax will not come into effect with regards to the 1 million dollar loan.

However, let’s say that New Estates LLC then decides to pay off the entirety of the 1 million dollar loan back to EG Funding.


Questions:

1. After the note has been paid off, does the estate tax come into play regarding the 1 million dollar loan that was made from EG Funding?  If so, how?

2. What is the longest legal duration that a promissory note can have? Could my business and my father negotiate a promissory note that is 100 years in length?

3. Does my being a signer on the EG Funding bank account affect anything with regards to the estate tax?

The Goal:
The goal here is to eliminate as much of the estate tax as possible while simultaneously growing my business at the same time and keeping the interest money in the family.

A few things that might be important to note:

1. I am gifted out.  Through a trust I am at the max capacity for what I can be gifted (ignoring the yearly 28k gift).

2. If my parents were to pass away, the EG Funding LLC would fall to me to run.  

Thank you for any insight and advice anyone may have on this subject.  Thanks!",finance,1433212271
personalfinance,Should I open another credit card?,"So I checked my credit today on credit karma and it went down 11 points to 784 since the last time I checked because a Jared Jewelery credit card I used a couple years ago to buy my wife's wedding ring automatically closed. The card had a 10k limit. The only other credit card I have is for emergencies only and has a 2k limit. 

I do not have any other loans or debt other than my mortgage.

Should I open another credit card with a high limit or will that do more harm to my credit than good? I was thinking about some kind of rewards card but I usually never use a credit card. The reason I never use a CC is because I have to use my debit card x amount of times per month to take advantage of my banks special interest rates where I make roughly $40 per month with my checking account interest and I see a CC as a last resort. I got the jared card because it was 0% for a year and it was a late Saturday when I couldn't get cash or call my bank to use my debit card for that large of a purchase at once.

Anyways will opening a new credit card help or harm my credit? Thanks!",finance,1433212875

investing,5 Tips For Landlords,"Everyone knows that property is one of the most popular forms of investment. Unlike shares, bonds, trusts etc. property has an extra safety-net in that people will always need somewhere to live. That said, this by no means guarantees that any property investment is a good one. House prices fluctuate, as do the rental returns – not to mention the fact that mortgage interest rates are also variable.
All things considered, property remains high on the list of possible investments for many and perhaps one of the biggest factors in making the investment a success is – THE TENANTS! Here are five tips for potential buy to let property investors:
 
Always Use a Contract
When you are first setting out in the property investment world, it can be tempting to cut corners to save a few pounds. Furthermore, you may already have possible tenants in mind; friends, family or even work colleagues. I previously lived with another couple back at University in my friends house and things actually got pretty ugly when it was time to leave. The other couple had informally agreed to live there for 6 months and wanted to leave after 4. There was no contract in place between ‘friends’ and as a consequence the friendship was no more – Don’t mix business with pleasure if possible.
Others will try and wrangle their way out of contracts on technicalities. In the UK a number of ‘standard’ contracts exist, so you won’t have to pay a lawyer to write one from scratch and solicitor’s rates can actually be pretty reasonable. If you want to save more money, you can actually download one of the tenancy agreements online and edit it yourself – although it might be an idea to have a lawyer check it over.
 
Get the Mortgage Overpayments Right
When you are investing in property, it can be tempting to get too carried away with the numbers. While paying of your mortgage(s) early is a great idea in principle, ensure that you don’t set yourself up for a fall. Reduced term mortgaged (15 years instead of 25 years for example) are very popular, but can also get you into deep water if the interest rates rise or your property goes through a period of being empty. Check with your mortgage provider, but you can often make overpayments within a given limit (usually 10% of the balance) without paying a penalty. This way, you can take a 25 year mortgage and overpay as and when you can afford to – you are not obligated to meet the higher monthly repayments.
 
Have a Contingency Fund
Unlike with stock and shares, an investment in property often requires ‘topping up’ to ensure that it continues to provide a sizable return. Curtains, carpets, walls, furniture, gardens etc. all need repairing and fixing at some point. Many landlords will charge tenants from their security deposit if they are directly responsible for the breakage of something, but soft furnishings all get tired with time. It might be a good idea to keep a ‘spares and repairs account‘ for the unexpected replacement of an appliance or to help you pay the mortgage if there is a gap between tenants.
 
Use an Agency or Do It Yourself?
The temptation when buying property as an investment is to think that you can manage it all by yourself. As your empire starts to grow, the demand on your time will also increase. Agencies charge a small fee, but can take care of many of the tedious tracks in the process. You don’t want a criminal or somebody who was evicted for trashing their last flat moving right into yours do you? Agencies can provide background checks for a fee – which you can usually pass on to the tenants and also take care of any midnight call-outs – not to mention finding the tenants in the first place!
 
Ensure That You are Insured
While this might seem blatantly obvious, it is by far the most important consideration of the lot. In my five years experience of being a student, I know of at least two groups of people who caused a fire and had to move out while the fire damage was repaired. Taking the toaster into your bedroom when you are blitzed may seem like a good idea at the time; but bed covers and heating elements don’t go well together! Many specialist companies like CIA Insurance can offer policies and advice to ensure that you have the right level of cover. The last thing that any property investor wants is to owe the bank a mortgage for a property that was destroyed. Fire is not the only force that can be of detriment to your rental – flooding, mold or disastrous tenants can all cause your property value to plummet!

personalfinance,Help with debt/learning how to save.,"Hi Guys.

Background: I live in an affluent area where everyones parents are quite wealthy and they give their children money. My parents arn't, and do not give me money to buy clothes, food, trips with. Most peoples don't I know.
Two years ago I became in debt 8k with a credit card at 19% interest and then got a loan at 22% interest for 10k to pay for that loan and my laptop for university. I used it to pay off the laptop but spent the money on a trip instead. Furthermore, I got a loan at 19.5% for 22k for a VW Golf for which I cannot sell (not worth what I paid for it at the moment, and I genuinely like the car). 

I need to get the loan and the credit card debt gone ASAP so I can get some savings and apply to transfer my car loan to a cheaper interest rate. 

I cannot get a balance transfer because my credit card is at zero balance and I've made some late payments. My loan comes out of my account every fortnight. 

Currently:

Phone Bill per month: $130 AU
Car Bill per month: $570AU
Loan repayment per month: $260
Credit Card repayment per month: $180
Petrol per month: $160
Gym Membership: $104 (I know, bad idea, but I am locked in for 12 months)
Bills per month: $120

I earn about 3k a month if I work enough hours.

2012 Dodge Ram - all gas/maintenance/insurance PAID FOR BY COMPANY

Car Allowance - $450 every paycheck/$900 per month. After taxes (25% federal, 0% state) I think its around 675? (anyone understand tax rules for car allowances?), $.29/mile for gas, only to be recorded for business travel. I estimate this as 40 miles/day. So maybe around 200$ a month I would get reimbursed. 

I don't drive a whole lot outside of work, maybe 20 miles/day with the occasional longer road trip, which wouldn't be covered using the car allowance gas mileage, But as I have stated before, using the company car would pay 100% for all gas and driving expenses.

So I do not currently have a car, I would have to buy one. I am guessing the best strategy would be 0$ down and try to keep payments/insurance under the car allowance, allowing some room for maintenance costs as well.

In 2008 I bought a house with an ex-girlfriend. We're both on the mortgage/loan. I want to get rid of it without losing my shirt. I do not care about any potential profit from the property.

~Financed $88,000. 0% down. 4.25% 2yrARM for 30 Years

~It now sits at $76,965.47 4.75 %

I have not had it appraised since it was purchased. Zillow now estimates it's value at $81,590

We took a 0% federal loan out after we bought the house ($3,750 each), this loan stipulates that the house has to be our primary residence or else we immediately owe the balance of the loan. (I pay $250 a year towards the loan during tax time)

In 2009 we separated. I lived in the house for a year or so afterwards, then got a job out of town (45 miles away). I have had relatives and friends in the house covering the mortgage since. I cannot afford to pay the mortgage and rent in my current apartment. I'm on good terms with the ex, but she's unable/unwilling to financially help with anything regarding the house.

I have more to lose if it falls to foreclosure than she does, so I grin and handle the burden. (I'm more concerned with my credit than she is.)




I'd like to get some advice. As I see it, I have a few options. I'm looking for the solution that makes the most financial sense.


A.) Sell the house for as much as I can through a realtor and take out a loan to cover costs (realtor fees, Closing costs, remainder of the fed loan, any loss on the actual house.) I'm guessing this will cost me my shirt.

B.) Contact Century21 or some leasing agency and officially rent the home until it builds more equity. This would mean getting a different insurance package, paying off the fed loan, changing the way i do taxes every year (Adding a rental property) and worrying about tennants I don't know living in the home.

C.) Continue to find friends and relatives to live in the home while it builds equity and risk the government figuring out it's not my primary residence. (I have no idea how badly I'm breaking the law with this situation)

D.) Move back in the home and commute 45 miles each day for the foreseeable future. (The house has bad memories and it's in a small town. I hate the idea of living in it again.)

E.) Refinance the house, taking the ex off the loan and hopefully getting a payment I can afford while I pay rent in another city. (This option, I'm guessing, would require a home appraisal and I'd need good credit. I'd also need her to be willing to walk away. I'm not sure what the costs would be. I'm worried that the home will appraise for less than I owe.)

personalfinance,Up-front interest rebates on Federal Direct Stafford Loans...where does it go?,"Hi PF!! I discovered this sub about a year ago, when I sat down with my student loans after graduating and realized how little I knew about money, my own finances, and the true cost of having student loans. Everyone here has been fantastically helpful, and I've learned loads, but I've finally come across a situation that nobody seems to have asked about before and I'd appreciate some insight.

I have 8 Federal Subsidized Direct Stafford Loans from my undergraduate degree at varying balances and interest rates. I've started slowly avalanching them (well, the one with highest interest) away in the year since graduation, thanks to y'all's excellent tutelage. Four of these loans, disbursed on 8/28/2010 to 12/27/2011, have recently shown up on my loan service's website (MyFedLoan.org) as having a ""Rebate -- Credited"" attached to them. I poked around and found their website stating that:

""If you borrow a Direct Loan, you receive an up-front interest rebate of:

0.5% of the principal amount of any Direct Stafford Loan (subsidized or unsubsidized) first disbursed on or between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011
1.5% of the principal amount of any Direct PLUS Loan first disbursed on or between July 1, 2000 and June 30, 2011

To keep this rebate, you must make your first 12 monthly payments on time (no later than 6 days after your due date). If you do not make your first 12 payments on time, the rebate will be rescinded and added to your principal balance, increasing the amount you must repay.""

I called my loan servicer, and the woman on the phone told me that the rebate was on the loan fee taken out by the university that the loans were disbursed to, but she couldn't seem to tell me where that rebate was going to. The latter part of the quote from the servicer's website makes it seem like you're granted the rebate up front and nothing changes after 12 months of payments unless you screw up somehow.

The woman was also muttering dates from 2012 and 2013, which is confusing me even more since the disbursement dates of the loans that have been ""credited"" don't align with the website's text, and I have 4 loans with disbursement dates in '12 and '13 that aren't credited.

Furthermore, it seems that last month, there was no interest on those loans and I just didn't catch it (which makes me feel kinda stupid).

Really what I'm hoping for here is a better explanation as to what the up-front interest rebate on these federal loans is and how it works. Thanks to anybody who can help me out.

personalfinance,Income Base Repayment on my federal student loans. Am I just hanging myself at a later date?,"about 2 years ago I placed my federal student loans on the ""income based repayment plan"". When I was once required $340 dollar monthly payments I am now only required 50$. 

For those who don't know about it, simply put I make payments based on what I make yearly. if I make more the following year my payments go up. If I make less they go down. if I amke nothing I pay nothing. after 20 years what isn't paid off is forgiven.

Now for the real worry! I read that forgiveness on credit is not something new, but its not totally free. once a credit is forgiven the person normally has to pay taxes on the forgiven amount that year. Does this apply the the IBR program when it comes to federal loans? This scares the crap out of me cause the IBR does not BEAT the loan. by the time the 20 years is up I may have paid off the initial loan, but certainly not all the interest. my total amount owed only goes up on this repayment plan cause its not beating the interest. my loans were at $49,500 but now are $50,300 in 20 years when I am forgiven am I going to be expect to pay a lump some of taxes on what could be about 70k?!?!

I will not be able to pay that at once and I cant imagine anyone who needs IBR being able to either.

I am 27, live in PA where cost of living is decent. I went to school to be an animator but my loans (both federal and private) were so damn expensive I couldn't afford to live anywhere to make my dream come true. luckily a friend helped me score an IT job where now I have plans to marry and buy a home. Currently making 35,000 a year. I am not living the high life but I can soon get out of my parents basement and on my own. But am I living a temporary dream? is this going to screw me when I have a house and kids and family who are dependent on me in the future? My fiance works but she has her own financial burdens. I always budget as if I was doing it alone and anything she can contribute is just icing on the cake.

All advice and info would be greatly appreciated.

::Edit:: Well so far the few answers I received confirmed my fear. so a question I would like to ask is. . . would it be possible to still pay the cheap monthly payments and at the same time throw extra money to keep the accrued interest down. so this way my loan is still going down. maybe not faster than a 20 year plan. . . but still down. then I can pay more as I make more later

::EDIT2:: Some people have mentioned paying more than the minimum. This doesn't make sense to me. the mimimum on a regular 20 year [payment plan was around 340. on IBR its around 50. what good would paying 200 on the IBR do? would I not have to pay 340 in order to stay ahead? 

For the record I have ALWAYS paid more than minimum. its a credo of mine. but in this case its different is it not?

::EDIT3:: Fell of from responding as I left for the day, but I did read and found out A LOT. thank you all! Pay the money back as fast as possible always the answer, but worst case scenario even after forgiven amount it will be a fraction of what is owed, so still saving a lot, and payment plans on the tax can go through IRS so I wont Sink IF and WHEN this happens. I will just have a little be more the trudge on this loan. Hopefully I can get it paid off in 20 though.

personalfinance,[TAX] federal tax return is still being investigated,"Hi,

I posted [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2wvl8k/received_irs_informational_letter_tax_audit/), that I'm still awaiting my federal tax return and the last notice letter from IRS said ""don't do anything, this should be completed May 7th"". Since then I've not received any updates from the IRS and tried calling them multiple times, without any luck getting a real person on the phone. ""We're too busy now, try again later &lt;hangup&gt;"". When I check the status of my taxes on the phone it says it's still in progress. Should I walk in somewhere and talk to a person, keep calling or just sit tight and wait for a letter?

personalfinance,Need Advice: Can/Should I refinance my student loans?,"I finished my Bachelor's degree in 2006. I consolidated my Stafford loans almost immediately after graduation.  I only have a few years of payments on the loan because it's been deferred due to grad school (I know that's not the best decision, but I was able to pay for grad school out of pocket without adding to my debt). 

I had an original balance of about $19,000 and a current balance of $15,275.  My monthly payment is now $181 and my interest rate is fixed at 6.375%. Consolidated through ACS.

My question is, is it possible to refinance student load debt if it's already been consolidated once?  If I do refinance, would it change my interest rate?  If this were a mortgage or a car loan or something like that I would definitely have refinanced already but I know the rules are different for student loans.  

$181 a month isn't bad, so if I can't do anything, no big deal.  My goal in refinancing is to reduce my minimum payment so I can start to pay more towards principal.",finance,1433265100

stocks,Should I buy delisted stock if I believe the company will turn around?,"TLDR: Historically, do delisted companies who turn around issue new stock, or relist their old stock?

Background: I'm basically new to stock investing and public offerings.

One company headquarted near where I live and that I've been following in the news for a long time and with whose product and industry I am very familiar has had severe financial problems and had to delist from NASDAQ.  The reason for their financial problems stems from the fact that before recent federal regulations, they were operating basically in a different environment, and they had been projecting revenue that simply isn't reasonable to expect going forward.  In other words, it seems to be a one-time crisis rather than a pattern of mismanagement.  Their OTCBB shares are now trading at pennies.  The company still is operating and has continuing customers, though, and recently was able to write off a lot of its debt and bring in a new management team.

If I believe the underlying business is sound and will generate enough revenue for the company to become profitable again within a few years, should I buy the OTCBB stock in hopes they will gain in value, or is it more likely the company would somehow offer ""new shares"" (not sure of proper terminology) and price of the OTCBB shares would remain relatively constant? If the latter, how does this process work?

EDIT: While I appreciate advice to stay away from OTCBB stock as a relatively new investor, I'd like to note that the point of the question really concerns the process that happens as a company becomes profitable again.  I don't take the matter lightly and am not planning to put a significant portion of my wealth into this or anything like that.",finance,1433268931

* Consumer Credit Counseling--with intention of going on Debt Management Plan. May still hurt credit but seems like the best option so far.
* National Debt Relief--they said they would settle my unsecured debt for  about ~15k, roughly 80 cents/dollar. The term is  ~$400/Month, 36 Months. Obviously would kamikaze my credit. The good news is that the debt is only in my name so the wife would still have credit worthiness.
* Additional loan--but can't get approved for full amount I need and obviously still be getting jack-potted on the interest rate. Thought about a co-signer but it seems like a temporary fix--maybe lower monthly payments but still the same long term situation.
* Bankruptcy--so depressing, time, legal fees, potentially losing my house. Having zero credit as opposed to just bad credit. BTW, my credit is ~640, biggest dings are having high balances.

(xpost from Personal Finance Canada)","I decided to crosspost these questions here, since the Canadian version of this sub is not very active at all. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!

Currently, I am 25 years old and working in Alberta. I have a job that provides a pension (public service pension plan) that I've been at for a little over two years, and besides that I have just recently started putting $250 in an RRSP every two weeks. The idea behind this was to eventually use this money with the home buyers plan to get my own place in the next 5 years or so. One thing I've just noticed is that my RRSP pays next to nothing: 0.20% interest? Really?! Granted, I only have $2250 in there at the moment, so I'm not sure if that would explain the abysmal interest rate. I don't know much about RRSPs, only that the employee I spoke to at the credit union and my parents both said it was a great idea. Starting to wonder if there's a better way for me to move forward with savings. I should add that my emergency fund is currently at $4000, with a goal of getting it to $6000 by the end of the year. I do not anticipate this being an issue. No debts, car and CC are paid off.

I've never contributed to my TFSA, so I would have lots of contribution room available. Would this be a better choice for me, considering that I already make about $800 worth of pension contributions every month? Would my returns be greater this way? I'm just shocked at how poor the interest is on an RRSP, it seems like I'm losing money on it rather than gaining, and that I would see better returns by just investing the money in other ways.

If I chose one word to describe my current financial situation, it would be confused. I have the will and ability to save, maybe even more than I am right now, but I feel like I lack the knowledge to make a good decision.

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment - Bank Wants 1/3 of My Income,"Genies of Personal Finance, please help me! I have $55,000 in student loans from a private bank that I have to start paying back in July (I just got a notification letter yesterday). I make $15-16,000 a year, around $1,300 a month. I'm worried - the payments the bank has demanded are $400 a month. I have no other debt. I have heard of a few promising courses of action, but I'm not sure where to start, and can't seem to find very much information about any of them. 

First, I've heard of a federal grant that will buy your loan from the private bank. I'd like to try this, but I haven't found any info on the program. If the federal government had my loan, it would probably be easier to make income-based payments. 

Second, my parents co-signed my loan, and I want their names off of it. I don't want them to be worried about their security if I'm not able to make payments. Unfortunately, I've heard the only way to do this is to refinance - and other advice has told me not to refinance. My parents are also offering to help me make payments, but they are both retired and I do not want to stress their finances.

Lastly, there are also some conspiracy-type theories that have caught my eye recently, about these student loans being illegal and that with enough legal expertise, one could successfully be free of their debt...But I don't know very much about this. I think it sounds super interesting though, and if anybody has any stories involving this sort of approach I would love to hear about it!

I plan on going into the bank and having a sit-down with one of the bankers, trying to negotiate the amount of the payments - are there any other things I ought to try and negotiate with the bank?

I guess I'm just hoping for a little advice for my situation, from people who might be better versed than I am on this subject.

Graduate fed student loans have an interest rate of 6.8% which is ridiculous. Look into: https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-refinancing-options/ 

Check out the options. DRB worked out to be the best for me.  

I refinanced at a 3.5% fixed rate for a five year term. Compared to 6.8% This will save me $33 per year, per $1000. My fed student loans were about 40k so I will be able to apply an extra $1200 to my principal loan this year alone. 

WARNING: If you do refinance your student loans you do lose some security (if you were to lose your job, die, etc.) So that is very important to think about before you refinance. 

I decided to keep my monthly payments the same and will pay my loans off 6 months earlier!

Also, I implore you to take a took at that site if you have private loans that are 4.0-4.5%-ish or higher. You might be able to save a ton of money. 

Just don't fall for ""Lower your monthly payments"" if you can afford what you are currently paying. This just extends the life of the loan and you end up paying more in interest.

Currently, this is my plan


$13k - Loan and CC Debt 

$15.5k – Holding for 2015 tax filing. If I am putting myself in the correct tax bracket I am putting aside about half (45%) for federal and state taxes. I am exercising and selling at the same time so it will count as ordinary income.

$2.5k - The remaining amount will be invested in my existing Roth IRA or added to my emergency fund


I was curious what would be recommended with the 14k while it sits. Currently, I am planning to simply open a checking/savings with Chase as there is an offer for $500 for new customers. However, is it advisable to invest the amount to make gains on the 14k while I wait to use the funds for income tax?

This would mean that I wouldn’t have to manage the funds, and it will be readily available when needed. When taxes are taken care of, I would be able to close the savings account without penalty.

personalfinance,PSA: Futures Markets predict future prices (probably better than you),"I've seen many posts on /r/personalfinance lately that are asking questions to which futures markets have the answers (sometimes in part). Questions like:

* [Where is the price of gas going?](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2rqmv4/yesterday_i_was_told_to_invest_is_gas_prices/)

I understand that many of you don't have exposure to the futures markets, and that standard futures contracts are a bit large for the individual investor (Gold, for example, is a 400 ounce contract, which has nominal value of around $475k at the moment, and the S&amp;P 500 is 250x the index, currently about $500k). However, even if you never trade a futures contract (and I'm not going to discuss trading, settlement, margin, and tax treatment of futures in this post), be aware that the futures market is the market for predictions in agriculture, energy, interest rates, stock markets, foreign exchange, housing, and metals.

If you believe the efficient markets hypothesis, then the present expected value of a good at expiration is exactly equal to the current price (more accurately, it is between the bid- and ask- prices) of the future. If you don't believe the efficient markets hypothesis, the futures market is the most liquid, most transparent, and most leveraged place to speculate.

Note: the futures market predicts expected values; variance is priced separately (either in a direct futures market like VIX, or through the options market). If deviations from the expected value could break you financially, you're exactly a use case that the futures market is designed for.

Here's an example of how to use expected values. I'm going to need to buy 500 gallons per year of gasoline for the next three years. Alternatively I can upgrade to a more fuel efficient car for $2000 (net over 3 years) and need 300 gallons per year. Is this a good idea? For simplicity, suppose I buy in June of 2016, 2017, and 2018. (The markets are granular enough that I can use a smaller interval, but I'm trying to keep the math easy). The current price (July 2015) is $2.0422 for RBOB, and I'm currently paying $3.069 at the pump, so I'm paying about $1.0268 in taxes, transportation, overhead, and profit. Suppose that number stays the same (probably some should be a percentage). Then I can compute:

Year | RBOB*500 | RBOB*300 | Tax*500 | Tax*300
---|---|----|----|----
2016 | 972.80 | 583.68 | 513.40 | 308.04
2017 | 982.20 | 589.32  | 513.40 | 308.04
2018 | 993.55 | 596.13 | 513.40 | 308.04
**Total** |**2948.55**|**1769.13**|**1751.04**|**924.12**

So the old car costs $4,699.59 and the new one $2,693.25, making it about $6.34 better to upgrade the fuel economy, a financial wash. Notice that the futures approach (in this case) comes to a different conclusion than just assuming that gas will be flat ($158.60 worse to upgrade).

TL;DR The futures market is (probably) smarter than you. Consult it to predict future prices.",finance,1433277681
personalfinance,"Taking out a personal loan versus a line of credit to pay for a required summer university course: upsides and downsides, possible benefits and pitfalls. What do I need to be considering?","Greetings PF.

This summer, I am in the position of needing to pay for a course that is not covered by my financial aid- a summer field camp course for geology majors, which is required for most institutions. I receive most of the money for my education through a combination of government grants, loans, and university scholarships. Thankfully, due to my high academic achievement, I have not had to take out many loans. As a senior, I have only $5000 in federal subsidized loans.

Field camp for geology majors presents an additional challenge of funding so I calculated that I would have to take out a federal loan to cover this amount. However, the government will not disburse aid money to more than one educational institution in one year and herein lies the issue. I applied for and was admitted to another university's field camp. I need my federal grants to go to my home university for 2015-2016 and so I cannot use them to pay for field camp at this other school.

I plan on applying for either a personal loan or a line of credit from my credit union. The interest rates, payment options, etc, are identical with both options. A plus here is that I figure I can pay off at least a good chunk of whatever I take out with my subsidized student loans this year, so I can pay less in interest.

Pros of having a line of credit over a personal loan: the money will always be there in case I need it again. I am thinking it will also build my credit more than a personal loan would, right, since it will be an open account for a long period? The cons are that, as a student, my incoming cash flow is not exactly stable. I do have a part time job, with the ability to work more as I please, so I don't worry about the ability to make payments on what I take out, but I have never had a credit card or line of credit before and I am very nervous about the prospect. My parents always scared me away from credit cards due to their massive debt problems, and I am scared of that happening to me. I am 95% sure that I could handle a line of credit very responsibly, but the possibility of things getting out of control is scary. 

I want to build credit, and this seems like a good opportunity to do so, but I am not sure if it is a good idea right now, as a student, so maybe the personal loan is a better idea. However, I will be attending graduate school, so I will be a student for a long time, so I don't want that to hold me back.

**TLDR:**
As a student with little credit history, should I get a line of credit or a personal loan to pay for a required summer course?

We set aside 12k for furniture and home improvements to the house but mostly just new carpet and paint. We also have 401k's with about 50k in each. My husband will have a pension and contributes extra into it and has an overage of about 110k by the time he retires it will be over 300k. We have no student loans, car loans or credit card debt. Both our credit scores are over 800 and as of now we have no children but will hopefully in the future. I think my husband is worried that when we do have kids we won't be able to afford all the bills when I change jobs to be closer to home, so basically what I'm looking for is advice on if we went over our means but buying this house and I'll have to stay at my current job because we won't afford it if I get a lower paying job. Also forgot to mention we both have investments with Ameriprise and Morgan Stanley in the amount of 160k but we don't really want to touch that. Any advice would be helpful.",finance,1433280136
personalfinance,14k in Student loans at 6.5% Interest. Worth draining cash savings/emergency fund to pay off loans?,"Ok. Here's my position. Trying to decide if it's worth draining my cash savings to get rid of student loans 6 years early. 
Here are some numbers. 

Federal Studnet Loans: $14,054 at 6.5% interest. Paying $236 per month with a pay off date of July 2021

Car Loan: $13,000 for 1.99% interest at about $234 per month for a 5 year loan

Savings Account: About $8000 plus cash from selling old car for $6000 totaling just about the exact amount of student loans. $14,054.


If I paid off the student loans now I would save about $5000 in interest over the next 6 years and would free up that $236 per month. Which would be added to what I put into savings each month. This isn't my only savings as I have my retirement account through work. But I would have NO emergency funds if something goes wrong in the next 6 months, other than my credit cards. Which makes me a bit uncomfortable. I also have a mortgage payment. So not making two $230 payments per month would give me a little monthly cushion instead of being a little tight.

I work for Costco. I started recently and only make about 16k/year after taxes. My pay will increase to around 35k/year over the next 4 years. I contribute to my employer 401k (Right now it's set to 5% of my salary and increases 1% every year).  If I understand everything right they will match the lesser amount of either half my salary or $500 annually as well as a discretionary contribution (which I don't really understand what that is that well) starting at 3%/year and increasing 1%/year to a max of 9%/year.

She works for the state and contributes to the PERS 2 (which I don't understand as well as I would like. The information I find online for it seems vague) plan that is available to her through her employer. She makes about 26k/year after taxes.

We live very close to both of our families (very important to my wife) and as a result we receive a lot of help support with childcare and pay nearly nothing for it. 

We have ~$22k in savings but I'm also carrying a little less than $15k student debt ($11k @ 6.8%, $3k @ 6% and $600 @ 5.8%). At the moment we are paying twice the monthly minimum on my student debt ($250/month instead of ~$125/month). Of the money we have set aside about 4k is set aside as a college fund for our daughter. 

My questions are;

I would like to open up an IRA (Either roth or traditional, leaning towards roth as my wife is concerned about not being able to use the money should something come up). With the interest rates on my loans would it be better to open a IRA now and make contributions to it while at the same time making payments to reduce my student debt? Or would it be better to take any contributions I would be making toward an IRA and put it toward my student debt to eliminate it faster? Are there other things we could be doing with our savings to improve our financial situation?

Along the same line, we have been considering putting the 4k we have saved for our daughters college into a college savings program. Would our states [529 program](http://www.get.wa.gov/) be the best option? What other options are even availble?

personalfinance,Loan options for an out of state classic car?,"Hello all,

I'm pretty prepared to get grilled over the ""financial sense"" of what I want to do, but I'll try to explain and ultimately I'd just like a little bit of information regarding my options.

I'm 27. Steady job, BA and MS. I make $75k per year (not including a quarterly bonus, but I don't count that). I bought a house for $135k last year. I pay $500 biweekly on my mortgage to cover everything (mortgage, taxes, insurance, etc.) This is a bit over my minimum payment. My interest rate is 4.25%. I have a roommate paying me $500 per month.

Three well maintained, reliable, efficient cars paid for (first car, winter car, daily).

I have $14,000 remaining in student loans at around 6%. This is down from $45,000 three years ago (when I started). My minimum payment is around $290 but I have been paying $500-1500 per month as I'm able.

$25k in 401(k)/Roth, contributing 6% to 401(k), 4% to Roth, 3% employer match.

Credit score: 780+

$7500 savings, $2500 checking, $0 credit card debt, a bit under $10k in company stocks that haven't vested.

I want to buy an aircooled 911. I have always wanted an aircooled 911. I spent many hours surfing the Pelican Parts classifieds while in college dreaming of the day 2-3 years down the road when I could buy my very own $15,000 911SC or 964, or longhood 911T. Anyone who knows cars now knows how laughable this is today (if not, read this http://driving.ca/porsche/911/auto-news/news/heres-why-cars-from-the-1980s-are-exploding-in-value).

Well, I found one. I spoke to the owner. It's exactly what I've been looking for, and gives me an unexpectedly low entry price into the market. This isn't an investment piece, but rather the realization of a dream that was shattered when prices began skyrocketing a year ago.

I'd like to buy the car. That being said, I don't (see above) have the cash available on hand to do this. **What are my options for obtaining a loan for around $15000? Home equity isn't on the table for me**. Most classic car loans require an appraisal which isn't something that I can do in this market. Typically cars sell within a day or so of listing. Ideally I'd secure a personal loan, buy the car, drive it home, have it appraised, and pay the personal loan with the classic car loan. Is this my only option? Are there others? Where do I go for a personal loan like this? My credit union caps at $5000.

I know I should save more than 13% in my 401(k). I know I should pay my student loans first. If this car sells, I will. But I'd just like to have a discussion about the feasibility of this and what my options are.

personalfinance,22 year old buying first car (used) - should I pay all cash or finance some of it to boost my credit score?,"Hey, r/personalfinance! I've been a longtime reader and big fan of this subreddit. I'm so glad a community like this exists to help other people out.

I am a recent college grad (majored in accounting) planning on buying a used car in the next few months. Public transportation is not an option where I live. I will be making $58,000/year at a place with high job security and I have zero debt. Assuming I stay at the same firm, I will be making ~$72,000 three years from now. I'm thinking of spending anywhere from $8,000 to $13,000 on a used vehicle, probably a late 2000s Japanese sedan like a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla, which I will keep for at least 4 years.

I have $18,000 in a brokerage account that was gifted to me by my grandfather. It is all invested, so if I want to take it out, I have to sell the stock and pay capital gains tax. All of the investments have appreciated in value since I bought them with the $18,000 I was given a few years ago.

Should I pay for the car in full with cash from that brokerage account or should I organize financing for the car? If I get financing, I was thinking that I could put down 50%-75% in cash for the car and finance the rest for 36 months for two reasons. First, interest rates are so low that I can use that money elsewhere and get a greater return. Second, having a car loan for 3 years will help my credit score assuming I never miss a payment.

Overall, I am expecting a $200 car payment, $250 for gas a month (this will drastically drop once I move out and live closer to work), and $170 for insurance a month. Is $620 a month in vehicle expenses reasonable? Also, what should be my mileage limit on the car I buy? I have no idea when a late 2000s Civic will start costing me a small fortune to maintain.

I am a medical resident. I make about $51.5k a year. When I graduated medical school, I applied for an income driven repayment plan called Pay as You Earn.

There was a question on the app stating: ""Is your current income significantly different than the income used to determine the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) reported to the IRS on your most recently filed federal income tax return?"" At the time, I answered NO because I had not started residency yet. I got approved for 12 months of $0 payments.

The time has come this year to update my information/re-apply for PAYE. My 2014 income tax return showed my Adjusted Gross Income to be $26000. This is because I started residency/work in July 2014. I have come back to the question: ""Is your current income significantly different than the income used to determine the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) reported to the IRS on your most recently filed federal income tax return?"" 

My thought is to answer NO because there is no definition of ""significantly different"" anywhere. I tried calling them and one person said that question is meant for incomes that have decreased.

personalfinance,Looking for a good mortgage loan repayment calculator or spreadsheet to optimize my funds,"* I have two mortgages (two houses).
* I live in one and rent out the other.
* The one I live in I have to pay PMI on and owe a lot more on it, but it has a lower interest rate than the one I rent out.
* The one I live in needs a lot of upgrades. I'm hoping to redo the kitchen, 2 bathrooms, bedroom, and deck over the course of the next two years.
* The money for the improvements is already saved up and in a low interest earning savings account.

Is there a calculator out there that can help me figure out the best way to utilize my money in this situation? I probably won't do any home improvements within the next 8 months, so it feels wrong to just have money sitting somewhere gaining lower interest when I have high interest loans.

1. I could take my savings account money and put it towards the low interest loan, knocking out PMI.

2. I could do the same as #1, but put it towards my higher interest loan instead (the one I rent out). I could potential completely knock out that loan if I do this.

3. I could do 1 or 2, and then take out another new mortgage when I'm ready to do home improvements.

4. I could do 1 or 2, and start rebuilding a savings account for home improvements and do the home improvements more slowly (as I the savings account grows, do the improvements as I can afford them).

5. I could keep all of my home improvement funds in the savings account, and instead of building onto that savings account I could slowly pay extra on either of the mortgages to accomplish the same as options 1 or 2, but over the course of several years.


I'm unsure of the tax implications of these options so I was hoping there is a good calculator out there that has that side of it built in.",finance,1433287905

personalfinance,"As a retirement account beneficiary (pre-tax) - Take a cash distribution, or roll into an 'Inherited IRA' account with required minimum distributions each year?","I'm the beneficiary of roughly $10k of my Grandmother's pre-tax 403(b) account. Here are my options:

A) Take a cash distribution, withheld at 25% for my Federal tax liability and ~7% for NY state (this withholding is optional, the Federal is not). My gross income will be around $50k this year, so this will not bump me up a tax bracket. 

If I went with this option, I would receive close to $7k in net proceeds. I would set aside $3k-ish towards my emergency fund (currently $1.5), and pay off my 6.55% student loan ($2k balance remaining), while putting a chunk towards my 5.69% car loan ($9k remaining). UNLESS it would be wiser to invest it, but from my understanding these interest rates are essentially a guaranteed return, no? (guaranteed return of 6.55% for knocking that loan out)

B) Roll it into an inherited IRA account. The funds would move and I would not be liable for taxes unless I withdrew from the account. However - there is a required minimum distribution each year, so I would still be liable, it would just be deferred over many years. My understanding is that my required distributions will be minimal, and one calculator I used claimed that the account could last into my 80s without any additional contributions (currently 23). I'm just a little unclear about a couple of things:

1. If I make additional contributions to this account, won't that affect my RMD, making it exteremely unwise to invest further in the account?

1. If I open a separate traditional IRA account, and make contributions to said account that match my RMD's would that essentially negate my tax liability on the distributions? (e.g. - RMD of $500 this year = + $500 in taxable income. Traditional IRA contributions of $500 this year = -$500 in taxable income). If this is indeed the case - would I be best off taking $5500 this year and depositing it into a traditional IRA, and doing the same with the balance next year?

If I went with this option, I'd likely continue my plan of building my emergency fund through budgeting excess cash each paycheck, and eventually moving on to paying down loans, etc. My RMDs would just act as a supplement to this waterfall. UNLESS that last bit in question #2 would be realistic, then it may just make sense to make negating contributions to a separate traditional IRA, and let the funds grow completely tax-deferred and free of RMDs.

I'm currently 21 years old living on my own in Chicago. I went to community college my first two years and split the payments with my parents so I have no debt from my first two years of college. I decided to transfer to a private university in the city and move in with some roommates when the housing plans fell through and I had to get a studio last minute at $855 a month.

I used the same information in tubotax, didn't try to game the system or anything of the sort, and got him ~$500 back from federal. State was the same though.

I worked a TA job for my university for the last (Spring) semester and earned $2043.79 after $154.35 paid towards federal income tax and $53.00 paid towards state income tax. I claimed 0 allowances.   

This summer I will be working an full time making approximately $1,635.20 every 2 weeks before taxes for 3 months (until school starts again), when I will go down to working around 10 hours per week and make approximately $368.00 before taxes every 2 weeks.

As such, I predict that my income for 2015 will be the following:


  * $2,251.14 from my TA Job
  * +
  * $9,811.20 3 months full time 
  * +
  * $3,312 4.5 months part time 
  * --------------------------------------
  * $15,374.30 2015 Gross Income
  * -
  * $6,300.00 Standard Deduction (can i claim this as dependent?)
  * -------------------------------------
  * **$9074.34 Taxable Income**

If I have done the math correctly, and if I can claim the standard deduction as a dependent, then $9074.34 will be my taxable income for 2015.

Falling in the 10% tax bracket, this would make me owe around $907.43 in federal income tax.

I have already paid $154.35 towards federal income tax from my TA job, and around $287 from my first paycheck from my internship (not including FICA and state income tax), adding up to $441,35. I didn't claim any allowances because I was afraid of not withholding enough, but I have come to believe that may have been a mistake. 

If I don't change my allowances, I think I will end up paying around $2,000 in federal income tax this year ($287 per paycheck during the summer), considering that I will probably pay around the same as my TA job per paycheck towards feral income tax -- $21.97.

In turn, am I correct to deduce that I should adjust my allowances in my W-4 to try to reach around $900-1000 in federal income tax paid that is paid evenly between my paychecks? Something like $33 per paycheck for the next 6 months for a total of around $400?

Am I on the right track with this math, or completely crazy?

personalfinance,Graduating resident doc. Need some advice.,"Hi, folks! I have to use a new account because the following will easily ID me along with other things I've posted with my old account. I'm graduating residency this June and am looking forward to my future.


My goals are to pay off debt and buy a home, while also providing money for college for my kids.


Income will be about $290K gross with wife and me, starting in July.


I own a condo that I'm renting out to a tenant, which is basically breaking even. Equity will give me a $10K gross profit if I sell now. My own living situation is that I am renting a place now, paying $2300 monthly.


We (wife and I) owe $260K in federal loans and about $20K in private loans. Average interest is 7% APR, with projected payments starting in July of $3000 monthly.


We also owe $27K in credit card debt, average 12% APR, with combined $600 payments monthly.


Car debt is 16K, with $500 payment monthly. APR about 3%.


Cable, gas, electricity, cell phones, etc, about $600 monthly total.


Also $800 to groceries and $2K to nanny.


In other words,

Monthly payments: 
$9800 minimum.

Monthly net after tax income with online tax calculators:
$12K


Not 100% sure about tax, but will hopefully be close.


Thus, hopefully, $2K to spare monthly.


Where should this money go?


I have heard of doctor mortgages for homes with minimal down (0-5%) and good interest rates, but my credit isn't so hot (mid-600s). In the area we live, housing that my wife wants would be $800K to $1.1M. Not at all sure we could afford even $800K, though the online calculators indicate we can.


Bottom line, I have seen great advice from all of you, and I trust you. I will seek out a financial adviser and/or accountant, but I wanted some advice from a community I trust, too.


I do know I need to pay down my credit card debt and set up a budget. Emergency fund is about $5K, and that's it.


I would appreciate any advice. I know I may be missing important info, but finance is not my specialty. If you need any other info, please let me know. Thank you all for any help you can give me. 


Edit: Sorry some folks didn't like my post. As to those of you who gave me advice, I really appreciate it, even the tough to hear stuff. Yes, we fucked up in big ways, but we're trying to make it better. Thank you for taking the time to read through my mess and help me out with it.

Many times, your ""student loan"" is actually a number of different loans bundled together, each with its own interest rate.  If you don't request to have your loans separated, the loan company will most likely apply your payments to all of them equally regardless of interest rate.  

My wife just finished graduate school, and we made our first payment to Nelnet, the loan company.  The website allowed us only one option-- pay off a single loan for $64,000.  On a whim, we called Nelnet to ask about the interest rate on the loan and discovered that it was actually three different loans at different interest rates that were bundled together (6.8%, 5.8%, 5.2%). We made our first payment naively assuming that the 6.8% loan would automatically be paid off first.  Later we called to double-check that this was the case... but discovered that all the payment was actually being split equally across all three loans.  We expressed our upset and asked why this was their protocol.  They apologized and said they would unbundle the three loans so we could pick which one we wanted to pay off.

After this frustrating experience I realized that most people probably don't take the time to contact their loan company, and just blindly make their student loan payments without checking how each payment is being applied.

personalfinance,Personal Loan From Employer/Company Re: Eventual Home Purchase,"&gt; tl;dr

Employer is a bit more than just an employer and wants to help me clear debt with a loan from the company.  The interest rate on this loan is a lot less that what I pay in on my credit cards.  Loan to be paid off in 2 years or less but I want to purchase a home in 1 year or less.  I am in the US.

&gt; The Questions

* Will I have to report this loan as debt on a home loan application?  It's not going to be reported or listed on my credit report.  
* Are there any other considerations I need to protect my company?  I've been here over 10 years, am not going anywhere, but I want to be pragmatic on the issue.  
* Any other advice/input is welcome

&gt; The long version:

So I am fortunate enough to have a very close relationship with my employer being employee #1.  I have been at this company for over 10 years and helped build it from almost nothing to a very good position today.  

There are options for me to get a % of the company but I want to get my personal finances squared away before I connect myself to the company.  My future partner, who is also a very close friend, has been trying to help me out with this for a while but I needed to do some things on my own first.  

In the past year or I have cleared some IRS issues, as well as, worked on rebuilding/establishing my credit (did not have a line of credit for over 10 years) and moved to a lower cost of living area. 

While the light is very much at the end of the tunnel, the steps above have left me with about $17,000 in debt on my cards.  Most of this came from having to put some purchases like a move on credit, a handful of unexpected travel costs for family emergencies and covering the cost of my partner who was unemployed for 5 months after our move.  She had to find a new job, whereas I work from home.  She is now employed in a very safe position that will be almost impossible to lose her job.  

I have set a budget and live inside of those numbers but the amount I am able to pay towards my debt is not enough to dig out of the hole as fast as I would like.  All of my debt is on high interest credit cards (19%-22%) and too much of my monthly debt service payments go to interest charges.  I do not owe anything towards student loans and currently do not have a car.  

**My goal is to be able to purchase a home in the next year or less.** 

In the next month or so, due to good things at work, I am going to be increasing my monthly income by about $2,000 to $2,500 per month.  

Added to this, my 'employer' wants to have the company provide me with a personal loan to clear my debt.  By law the company would need to charge 3% interest on the loan but that is nothing compared to what I am paying on my lines of credit.  

My thinking is I set a repayment schedule of 24 months, which at 3% would have a monthly payment of $730.68.  This loan payment, while a lot of money, would easily be covered by my raise in income.  

The rest of the new income, after taxes, would be split into two.  The first half would go to a savings account for a down payment/closing costs on a new home.  The second half would go towards paying off the loan faster on a + principle payment.

&gt; The Questions Again For Those Kind Enough To Read Everything

* Will I have to report this loan as debt on a home loan application?  It's not going to be reported or listed on my credit report.  
* Are there any other considerations I need to protect my company?  I've been here over 10 years, am not going anywhere, but I want to be pragmatic on the issue.

I'm hoping for some financial advice, mostly to see if I should even bother meeting with a financial advisor/bank anytime soon.

My husband and I own a house, and we want to move to a better house (current neighborhood is crappy, house is tiny). We are also pretty broke and just had a baby. Right now, our money coming is all too close to our money going out. 

I pay $400 a month in student loans (33k in total at a ghastly near 7% interest rate). If we sell our current house, our profit would cover that amount. There might even be a bit left over, but I don't want to count on it. That $400 a month could then go towards the mortgage on our new house. Ideally, a portion could go to the new mortgage and a portion could go to savings. By doing this, we would be investing money into our equity/life instead of just paying down debt.

We would not have a down payment. We have modest savings: 10k in savings, plus another 20k-30k in various retirement accounts, but we'd rather not go broke. The bank might let us borrow against our accounts, but I'm not sure. We both have good credit.

Our current housing situation is bearable, we have a fantastic interest rate (2.something %) and we are slowly chipping away at the amount owed on the house.

So, should we stay or should we go?

In a few months, my husband will be at a higher pay grade and bringing home $400 extra each month. We both have stable jobs. But, with the baby, we don't want to do anything too risky.",finance,1433345719

I put it and another $1000 that I saved into a Vanguard mutual fund that earns about 10% per year. I have one bank account and no credit card. My parents are putting money into an IRA for me and maxing it out so I cannot do anything with that.

Future Plans (this is where I would like comments and suggestions please):
First, I plan on getting married immediately following graduation. My fiance has no debts and no assets. My fiance is planning on attending grad school too, and also has scholarships and such that pay for that.

Once I graduate and have to start paying back the loan I plan on paying back the minimum every month and instead of removing money from my mutual fund and paying back with that I plan on paying back the loan out of my paycheck. It's about $650 a month that I will have to pay back but I think we'll be able to live on that. Once I get a pay raise I plan on putting the same percentage of my salary into the mutual fund. I.e. if the $650 per month is 14% of my total salary, then when I get a pay raise to $60,000 per year then I'll put $8400 a year into my mutual fund. 
I also plan on getting a credit card in the near future in order to build up a credit score since I believe I don't have one.

Is there anything that I am missing? Do my plans seem reasonable?",finance,1433346664

personalfinance,How does a bankruptcy affect eligibility for mortgage later?,"I filed for chapter 7 6+ years ago, and have been able to rebuild my credit since then (in the low 700's now). I carry no credit card debt, have an auto loan that I overpay every month, and an overwhelming ammt of student loans (almost 6-figures), but I have been on a steady IBR repayment plan since leaving school (and have had steady income as well). My SO and I are considering buying a house, and he's got no debt, immaculate credit, solid savings, etc etc etc. 

This is what I'm curious about: how would my bankruptcy possibly effect our application for a mortgage, if we applied together? Would we be better off just leaving my name off all together? Or does the application look less at the action of filing and more at other things like credit history, credit score, etc? I imagine that the addition of my income would get us a larger pre-approval number, but that's no necessarily what we're looking for...our main goal is to just get the lowest interest rate possible.

personalfinance,"A question about improving my credit score, with examples of actions I can take.","Hello, all. I read through the Wiki and it's very helpful, but at this point I need help determining which course of action is going to be the most beneficial to me.  
  
My credit score is 634. I have two debts in collection totaling ~$1300. My credit card limit was recently extended $1000, so now I have $1450 in credit available to me.  Would it be more beneficial for me to:    
  
A) Use my new found credit to pay off both debts in collection in full, thereby consolidating all of my debt into just my credit card?  
  
or  
  
B) Continue to pay off my credit card, getting my balance as close to $0 as possible while leaving these debts in collection for another time that I can pay them off straight away?  
  
Obviously I have to consider the fact that my credit card interest rate is something like 25%, so adding another $1300 to it (pushing it to nearly $4000 CC debt) will increase the amount PER MONTH I'll have to pay in interest alone. It's also my understanding that paying off a debt in collections doesn't necessarily do anything for your credit score.

personalfinance,Invest vs. Loans vs. Roth - Please help me allocate,"Hi - I'm starting law school in August and have to decide how much to take out in loans.  Here are the numbers:

$70K saved (10K emergency fund I'm not touching, 5.6K in a Roth, and the rest in mutual funds)

First year of law school estimated total cost of attendance: ~45K

My options:

1) Take out loans (mix of 6.8 and 7.9% interest for Stafford/PLUS loans; 4.3% origination fee); stay invested

2) Cash out investments to avoid loans for the first year (dodging one year of ~7% interest + 4.3% origination fee)

3) Hybrid - take out only the Stafford loans (slightly lower interest rate) so that I can continue only taking out Stafford loans next year; cash out investments to cover the difference

And regarding the Roth, for the duration of law school (3 years):

*Max out $5500 in Roth each year, or save for liquid cash

What should I do?  I am leaning towards trying to avoid loans first year, cash everything out, and max out my Roth - is this stretching things too thin?  I like the idea of keeping up with Roth because I can't go back in time to add more, it seems like a wise long-term decision.  Anything else I haven't thought of?

My goal is NOT public interest law; I am hoping to work at a big law firm and would likely restructure my loans after law school for a lower interest rate.  I have a little over a 50% chance of getting it based on employment statistics for my school.

My SO and I are attending University. Currently renting out a room in a house, and splitting bills down the middle. Her job is starting to cut immensely back on hours and it seems like she might be cut soon due to being overstaffed. We have enough to cover rent and food and school for the summer, but its kind of scary to think past that. She gets a good amount from financial aid in the fall that should cover for rent for most of the year, but im afraid of not having enough of an emergency fund. 

She has already began her job hunt again, but we are just worried about any emergency expenses. We both only work part time, and are making minimum wage.

personalfinance,19 year old student looking to build credit,"Hi guys, I'm in search of advice on how to effectively build my credit. I realize this takes time and I'm ready to invest the necessary effort: I just want to have a solid credit score when I graduate in 3 years, I'm not looking to take out a car loan in two months or something. Not quite sure if you need any specific info so here's a summary:

* Income: I do not currently work but I receive a refund from my financial aid twice a year, and I budget as much as I can (eg I use buses so the $500 or so I get for ""transportation"" every semester can be used elsewhere; I can afford about $650/mo for housing, I'm at a place where I pay about $400) All in all if I'm careful I can probably save away around $1000 semester, so $2000 to maybe $2500 a year.

* Debt: I have a $5500 loan which is federally subsidized, so there is no interest until after I graduate and I do not need to make any payments until after I graduate. I am planning on setting some money aside to help pay that, but I'm not too worried about it; that's the only loan I needed (taken for summer semester when I did not have any of my financial aid) and the payments should be manageable after graduation. Thus I would prefer to keep any savings liquid or invest them elsewhere rather than start paying that early. If this seems questionable I would welcome advice. 

* Credit: Other than the federal loan, I have never taken out a loan, and I have not had a credit card. I do not know my credit score.

* Banking: I have a checking account with Wells-Fargo.

* Investments, assets, etc: None. My parents are poor and by extension I am as well. 

--------

Should I just get a credit card and put my expenses on it to pay off every month? If so, where, based on rewards/customer service? Do I keep the Wells-Fargo account and apply for a card from them or should I look for another bank or perhaps a credit union?

I work for a big company in an important position how ever my pay doesn't reflect I make an okay hourly wage for the economy we live in in terms of what I do I make 1/3-1/2 of what I should.  Basically 35k gross before benefits and taxes. 

My fiance has been at the same place 4 years and it's total shit not getting raises she's been promised crappy expensive benefits.  

We have a 3 month old and times have gotten tough.  She was on maternity leave in wich her benefits are supposed to pay for how ever took 2 weeks for her work to put the paper work in. Another 2 for her to get her first check.  they cut her off after 5-12 why? Because they can. 

This has caused me to burn through our savings and we don't live out side of our means at all.  She has pre rendered debt prior to our getting together that makes it hard.  

We moved back in with my mom a few months after we found out she was pregnant. Wich gave us a chance to attrack some of our debt and pay off bills.  I pay rent so it wasn't super effective but it helped.  

My total debt is 

19k for the car we got her 
3500 for ccd on my end 
4800 for my car 
400 student loan for my self 
1k in utilities ( we shut off to love and continued paying however they have there own collections and decided to throw me in default.)

Its not a whole lot of debt compared to some.  But with the baby her being in the hospital for pancreatic necrosis and him having a surgery due to pyloric stenosis on top of car insurance and rent and the cellphone bill and every thing els I feel like I'm drowning.  I know I don't have a super sob story but truth is I'd like to be able to start over fresh and allow her to claim bankruptcy because she has no choice.  I'm honestly only posting this because I know it'll get burned to the bottom of reddit. But I guess you never know until you try.  Now that she's back to work were having to wait 3 weeks until we get her first check I feel as if my credit is in jeopardy and the next step is a mortgage once our bills are paid down and we get a good sum of money stuffed away.  

I feel so dumb for even posting this it's completely embarrassing for me.  Coming from a poor family having little to no money is a common thing.  But my mom always made sure the bills were paid I feel as though I can't even hardly do that haven't been able to pay the 50.00 on my student loan in 3 months.

personalfinance,Finishing construction - pay off or mortgage?,"I'm finishing construction on a house. The construction was financed with a loan against my stock portfolio, which is about $3M, and total construction costs came to about $800k. The land the house is on is worth about $300k. The loan for construction is variable rate, at prime - 100bps (2.25%), 12 months. I still have a few months left on that line, but when it's up I'll have to either pay it off or roll that into some form of longer-term financing, as I'm not willing to bet that rates stay low.

My question is at what interest rate it would make sense to take out a mortgage to pay off the $800k vs paying it off in cash? 10 year average for S&amp;P is well above what I expect I'd be able to get a 30-year fixed mortgage for (3.75+/-). Is there any reason not to mortgage? I mean I suppose theoretically I could lose my job and be forced to sell assets in a poor market to cover the mortgage payments, but I'm not sure how to model the cost of what I'd likely have to sell for various values of a ""bad"" market downturn. For instance, if the market dropped 30% and took three years to recover, and I had to sell assets monthly to cover the mortgage payments, is that ""bad"" enough to negate the earnings I'd make by having this $800k invested?

For the last two semesters, I have paid for my classes and then my employer reimbursed the full amount on the next paycheck.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated before I shell out some money to one of the big tax guys.

* Balances on accounts are high compared to credit extended

This would have been my first credit card, so no I have no general purpose cards.

I also have one small personal loan taken from my bank that I opened in the Summer of last year. I have two payments left on that and it will be closed.

Car is fully paid off and I rent my home. I have one student loan (~22k), and one personal loan (~$240 - will be paid off at the end of July). I've never missed a payment on either.

* By consolidating my student loans in the Fall did that hinder my ability to get approved for a general purpose credit card?
* What exactly does ""balances on accounts are high compared to credit extended"" mean?
* How long should I wait to consider another credit card company? I don't want to negatively affect my score by applying for another card. I know each company does a hard inquiry.

I'm 19, and I worked a part time job my spring semester, and my federal income tax rate was around 5%. Now I'm working full time over the summer at $10/hour, and my federal income tax rate is closer to 10% (judging from my paystubs).

If I make less than $6000 or so, shouldn't my federal income tax rate be 0%?
And if so what should I do? Can I file my taxes to get my money back?  
I am paying taxes right now, and with Social Security and Medicare, that's 23% of my income. I'd like to receive a tax return.

Little confusion for me:
It's my understanding that if you're not claimed as a dependent, you can include your standard deduction while filing taxes (around $6,200). And if you make less than that, you don't need to file taxes.

I think I'll be claimed as a dependent. I've lived on my own in 2015, attend college full time, and I'm under 24. I receive little to no support from my parents, but I expect that one of them will claim me anyways. Since I'll be claimed as a dependent, do I still get a standard deduction?

personalfinance,Ship has come in! Pay off mortgage or wait and sell?,"After many years at high tech startups, my employer's IPO has furnished me with a set of vested stock options that'll net me (at CMV) $75 per share. I have 20K of these shares, with more (at much higher strike prices) to vest in the years to come. This is not to brag, it just is what it is, and I know I'm blessed with this. However, this has me thinking about what's best to do with the sudden potential influx of cash and freedom.

My family is debt-free beyond our mortgage (CCs paid off monthly, no car or student loans, no home equity loan). We're 12 years in to a 30 year fixed @ 4.275%, with $165K left on the nut. We're torn as to whether to stay in our current home (like, not love) or move to newer construction in the same city. Either way, while the mortgage interest deduction has been helpful, getting out from under the mortgage seems like the best bet.

I believe the prudent thing would be to cash in some of the options (say, 20%) to net ~$200K (300K, minus 30% withholding) and pay off my mortgage. Obviously, that greatly increases my taxable income for FY2015, but withholding covers much of this up front, so while the fed income tax will be high for this year, I won't be paying a ton to the feds. FWIW, my state does not have an income tax.

Does this seem wise, or should I simply work on selling the house in the next year or two, continuing to pay the mortgage in the meantime? My home is not under water equity-wise (bought at $220, valued at $270, likely to sell for said value, +/- 10K), and is entirely livable, but is at a point where reno work is likely needed to keep it up-to-snuff with the rest of the market.

All credit cards are budgeted to be pay the statement balance in full every month. I've never had a late payment.

In my first job, I made $41k before taxes, and with my student loans on a 10-year plan I was paying $1400 per month. That was too much at the time so I extended them and switched some to IBR. My thinking was that I could use extra money from paying less to attack loans with a higher interest rate, while also enjoying more money to play with. Dangerous idea, but paying $1400 for 10 years living at home is miserable - there was no room to pay more money on loans so that would have been my life for 10 years. 

Now I'm making more money. I want to keep the loans where they're at, and actually start paying more down on the ones with higher interest rates.

My beater car broke down last year, so I gave in and bought a new car. Definitely irresponsible, but I can afford it. So with the $831.21 that I outlined above, I think my best course of action is to pay off that stupid Macbook loan, then pay off the car, then start with student loan #4, then on to the largest of student loan #5.

What do you think? I would gladly accept advice on anything here. I know most of my decisions have been horrible, but I don't think I'm in the bad spot; I can recover. I want to pay off my car and pay off one student loan before I move out - about 4 years I estimate.

personalfinance,Question about updating my information for my student loan repayment plan,"Hey guys,
I am a medical resident. I make about $51.5k a year. When I graduated medical school, I applied for an income driven repayment plan called Pay as You Earn. When I filled out the application last year, I linked my 2013 Federal Tax Return which showed an income of $0. There was a question on the app stating: ""Is your current income significantly different than the income used to determine the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) reported to the IRS on your most recently filed federal income tax return?"" At the time, I answered NO because I had not started residency yet. I got approved for 12 months of $0 payments.
The time has come this year to update my information/re-apply for PAYE. My 2014 income tax return showed my Adjusted Gross Income to be $26000. This is because I started residency/work in July 2014. I have come back to the question: ""Is your current income significantly different than the income used to determine the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) reported to the IRS on your most recently filed federal income tax return?""
My thought is to answer NO because there is no definition of ""significantly different"" anywhere. I tried calling them and one person said that question is meant for incomes that have decreased.

personalfinance,Strategy for paying off student loans?,"I have recently graduated and am beginning my career as an Optometrist. I have remaining student loans (much less than average thanks to buying and selling a house during school) and was wondering if there is an algorithm best suited to paying down my loans the quickest with the least amount of interest with a set amount of $1500/month. The loans are:

Unsubsidized Loan: $40,500 at 6.21%
Unsubsidized Loan: $19,715 at 5.41%
Subsidized Loan:  $8500 at 6.8%​

Myfedloan suggests a monthly payment of $1330 if I want to pay them off in 5 years, paying them all down equally with no specific amount toward any one loan. Is there a way to maximize which loan I specifically pay towards most to minimize time and money in interest? The minimums I must pay are as follows (on the standard 10 year plan).
$8500 monthly minimum: $97.82
$19715 monthly minimum: $212.98
$40,500 monthly minimum: $453.92

 2.43% (interest rate)

I just wanted to clarify and get some opinions on this loan, this is saying for the duration of my education +6 months I only have to pay the 35 dollars, and then after that the 300 per month correct? Should I be weary of the variable interest rate (is it tied to a floating rate like LIBOR) because I obviously want to limit my total debt, and I will have no problems making payments of 35 dollars a month while in school, but I feel like borrowing 17 and only having to pay back 19, there must be some sort of catch.

there are a few other loan options and I will post them if people would like to see / if they think that would be helpful,

* Grew up with debt as a part of life

* Parents plan for college? Get a loan.

* I want to change that attitude. I hate debt, and I generally feel pretty anxious about the looming payments I have.

* Working in Ministry (so there are some interesting tax implications)

* Average salary in my field is 35k. I have no intentions of changing this field, I'm very passionate about it.

* Have 3 (2 part time, 1 full time) years of experience already. Currently working as interim, could be permanent.

* Current salary: 27k (Interim, without degree)

* Come August of this year I should be making at least 35k (removal of interim label)


* ~70k student debt (21k private loan, the rest is federal)

* ~6k auto loan debt

* ~$800 Credit Card

Things I'm doing:

* I actively budget

* Saving goals (including saving for a big extra loan payment on my 25th birthday)

* Reading a lot on finances, teaching myself

* I know some people who specialize in minister finances and taxes, consult with them whenever major decisions 
needed.

* Plan is to tackle private loans first

Questions:

* Any advice or tips?

* Have I borrowed too much? How worried should I be? Should I plan a bank heist?

* Is there anything I can do now?

* Any tricks or programs I should know about?

* I was advised to use some of the extra federal loan money to pay off my private loan as the interest rate and payment plans will be significantly better, can I do this? Is it legal?

investing,Question about rising interest rates and impact on different investment sectors.,"A lot of my investments are in banks, energy, REITs a bond fund and other high yield dividend things. In the near term I'm wondering if this is such a good idea. I still have a lot of cash on the sidelines because quite frankly I'm a little aprehensive about us maybe being near a top and also. When the market was way down in 2009 I some things looked like screaming buys I had no free cash to buy things that were at fire sale prices. 

Rising rates seem good for financials- it means hopefully a better economy and more people buying houses/cars etc. It would mean more paid out to savers but more money made on loans. 

What happens to energy stocks and their dividend yields? Also I know with bonds price goes down when yield goes up, but I found a REIT paying 12+% (MITT) and a bond fund (EVV)paying 8% with a monthly dividend. I'm kinda wondering if theyre gonna tank. I plan on holding them a few years- but if theyre gonna go down 30% holding onto them seems like a bad idea when I could invest somewhere else and buy them later. I do have DRIP set up, so it doesnt really matter. Also knowing when to buy back in is a gamble Buying and holding in a market crash hurts- but it's easier than trying to time things.

personalfinance,I need a new car...but can I afford it??,"Hello fellow redditors,

28/m who just finished a bachelors of Accounting and starting work July 20th with a big 4 firm. I will be starting at 52k per year salary and leaving school with 61k in federal student loans (average 5% interest) and 10k in private student loans (7.25% fixed).

I've had my 2001 Hyundai Elantra since my senior year of high school. It currently has 188k miles and is covered in unfortunate body damage. There is rust surrounding both back wheel wells and covering the door runners on both sides, a broken taillight (covered with red tape), punched-in rear passenger door and trunk, punctures in the bumper, etc. It also needs engine work and 4 new tires, all of which I am positive would add up to more than the car is worth (which isn't much, 500-1000??). I know I should have taken better care of it, but just didn't care until about a year ago when I came to terms with the decisions I had been making. Because I will need a car to get to work and occasionally drive clients around, I feel its time for a new vehicle. I am not delusional, and I know I don't need/can't afford a nice new car - what I am looking for is something that will get me through 5 years or so until I'm in a better place financially to purchase something nicer that will last longer. It just needs to be clean and run well.

The kicker is that because of some poor life choices I made in my early 20's (lots of credit card debt I have only recently fully paid off, thank god) I have nothing saved up for a down payment and a credit score of only 690. I'm thinking a small loan through my credit union may be my best bet.

**My preliminary monthly budget is as follows:**  
Net pay (after taxes, 401(k), health insurance, and HSA contribution): 2854  
Rent: 690  
Utilities: 80  
Car payment (5%/36 mo): 234  
Gas (car): 70  
Car insurance: 100  
Groceries (for two): 300  
Student loans: 800 (≈$200 more than the minimum payment)  
Parent loan: 150  
Car maintenance fund: 75  
Lifestyle expenses: 150 (haircuts, new clothes, eating out, etc.)  

This leaves me with $205 roughly still un-allocated, which will likely end up going to building an emergency fund. 

My car payment is a worst case estimate, derived from the following: I read that you shouldn't finance more than 15% of your annual salary for a vehicle, which for me is $7800. I have only an average credit score of 690 and I assume/hope I can get a 5% loan at my credit union with that. I figure 12% roughly for tax/title/licence, which would mean I can afford a maximum of $6,954 worth of car without going over that $7800 limit. Of course, I'm sure I can find something less than that I will be more than happy to do so.

Am I right on, close, or way off on both my budgeting and need for a car? What should I be doing differently? I currently make about $1600 after taxes, but have no student loan expense (they start in October), parent loan payments, and spend less on lifestyle and grocery expenses. Put another way, I'm taking in more than I spend, but not by a lot.

TL;DR Is my budget (especially the car payment) too wacked for my financial situation? If so, what would be a more realistic solution?",finance,1433452351

I have a little over $1500 of my own money available and my school has given me an estimate of $32,974.00 a year COA.

personalfinance,student loan deferment + more,"Hi everyone,

Quick summary...I am 27, work-full-time for ~37000. I graduated college 2010 owing (this is cringe worthy) about 100k. Really don't want to hear anything about this number...my parents borrowed everything in my name without me knowing, I had no idea how much debt I was in until the grace period ended. Anyway, I am very responsible I have paid down my school loans so they are now ~36000 by being extremely frugal and various side jobs. 

Savings: $7550
Discover: $10200 @ 3.5%; 5800 @ 6%
Navient: 3 loans total $5800 @ 5.75 and 6.55% (federal)
MyGreatLakes: $4430 (interest unknown, federal)
Citi: $9100 @ 4.5%
Car: ~$4000 @ 4.25% (paid off in two years)

My take home pay is about $2040/month. Student loans are 490 a month, the car is 180, rent is 700. I don't budget w/ any side job income as it varies (and its been zero lately). I had been thinking of writing a post on here to see how people think I am doing, whether or not it would be a good idea to use my savings to pay off any of my loans in full (either the car or 6% one from Discover). But now I finally am because a graduate class triggered a deferment  from Navient and I am sure the same will happen soon w/ mygreatlakes. I definitely want to pay off my school loans as soon as possible and I know I can keep making payments through deferment. Right now I am eligible to get the last 6 months of payments forgiven from Navient by continuing to make on-time payments, I am about 5 years out w/ 5 years to go. Two of the three loans from Navient are subsidized and the interest for those two is only 20 dollars a month. If I get rid of the deferment and continue paying like I have been it'll save me almost 700 dollars at the end (113 a month x 7 months). Or I could only pay the interest and pay extra to my private loans.

I have excellent credit (around 750). Not gonna lie I've paid down my loans a lot already but it has been miserable, working all the time, never going on vacation, living in the ghetto. Having some wiggle room would be nice but I know I shouldn't. 

Hope this all makes sense...any feedback much appreciated...thanks everyone!

I recently turned 18 in the past couple weeks. Becoming independent I branched off of Wells Fargo's ""teen account"" and became an adult client. I created a savings account and have applied and assured I will be getting their college student credit card for the purpose of building up credit.

**Savings**


I currently have about 4.5k in my savings account and it will increase due to the money I will be receiving at graduation. 

I work as a delivery driver and this summer I will be making $7.75/hr + tips. I plan to put a lot of this in savings.

**College**

I will be attending a private university out of state next year. I plan to major in sports management. After that I plan to go to law school. I plan to become a sports agent, or someone involved in the sports world. This is what I have received from them at this point in terms of financial aid...

High school scholarship | $500

Total | $52.6k

I have received a good amount of money from the university as you can tell, but it's not enough. I know a lot of people on this sub are going to say that going to this college isn't the best choice for my future, but I know this college is very special for me and my future. It is my dream school. I am not worried I am making the wrong decision, I am finding the best ways to save and invest my money. I want to start managing my future.

personalfinance,How do I prepare for my future?,"Hello /r/personalfinance, how you all doing?

I recently turned 18 in the past couple weeks. Becoming independent I branched off of Wells Fargo's ""teen account"" and became an adult client. I created a savings account and have applied and assured I will be getting their college student credit card for the purpose of building up credit.

**Savings**


I currently have about 4.5k in my savings account and it will increase due to the money I will be receiving at graduation. 

I work as a delivery driver and this summer I will be making $7.75/hr + tips. I plan to put a lot of this in savings.

**College**

I will be attending a private university out of state next year. I plan to major in sports management. After that I plan to go to law school. I plan to become a sports agent, or someone involved in the sports world. This is what I have received from them at this point in terms of financial aid...

Type | Money offered
---|---
Subsidized loan | $3.5k
Unsubsidized Loan | $2k
University Scholarship | $10k
University Grant | $9.9k
High school scholarship | $500
Parent PLUS Loan | $27.2k
Total | $52.6k

I have received a good amount of money from the university as you can tell, but it's not enough. I know a lot of people on this sub are going to say that going to this college isn't the best choice for my future, but I know this college is very special for me and my future. It is my dream school. I am not worried I am making the wrong decision, I am finding the best ways to save and invest my money. I want to start managing my future.

As the title says i am looking to get a credit card and i would like to know which are my best options. I bank with chase but ive been told not to lock myself down with just one company.

personalfinance,Cr,"Alright, so here's my situation.

I'm 22 and I have 2 credit cards, both through Capital One. I got both of them when I was around 18 or 19. The oldest card has a 19% APR and the other has a 24% APR.

The card with a 19% APR is paid off. The card at 24% has about $3600 (out of a $4000 line) on it.

Obviously I need to pay that off. I went through with the advice of some on this sub and applied for the Chase Slate card for the 0% APR and 0% transfer rate. I was approved.

**My question is**: I still want to keep these two Capital One lines open as they are my oldest lines by a good 4 years, but those interest rates are nuts. Should I negotiate a better rate with Capital One by using this ""other Chase card with 0% APR"" as leverage? Will they know that I've already been approved for this other card? Whether or not they bump the APR down, I'm going to transfer that $3600 to my Chase card. I just want to know if this is the best way to go about getting a lower rate on the two cards I already have.

I'm a responsible young guy with a ~750 credit score.  I want to go to my bank and take out a loan for $3,000 to purchase a used motorcycle.  I have the cash to buy one outright but I am moving soon and I'd rather chip away at it in case something with my new job falls through and I need a cushion.  My bank would be Wells Fargo.

I'm assuming I go in, tell them I'm interested in a small loan, they sit me in a room and ""negotiate"".  

What interest rate should I expect?  Can I counter-offer their interest rate?  What type of interest rate should I say ""hell no"" to?  My current credit cards have interest rates from 9% to 13%.  I have not looked into cash-advance interest rates for these cards and I can't seem to easily locate this information.

I was recently offered a position at my job that comes with a sizable increase in salary. Coming from a low-class family with very little in the way of financial knowledge, I'm not to keen on how to handle this size of an in come. What I need to do is save for a car, currently I bus to work, and while it will work for now, sometimes I'll need to be on call for the new position, and having a car will make that easier.

personalfinance,Need advice on overbearing college expenses,"Hello /r/personalfinance I am currently a student at a 6 year pharmacy school entering my 3rd year in September and I am seeking advice on a way I would be able to finish school. First of all 6 year pharmacy program provides students with a Pharm D after graduating and because it is a specialized program, most credits are not transferable to other schools. The tuition is almost $40000 a year but with scholarships it is around $10000 which I have to pay. 5th and 6th years, my scholarship would also not be eligible due to those years being counted as graduate school years. I was able to scrape through my first two years with few external scholarships and money that I had saved up from working throughout high school and college. My other living expenses including rent, utilities, transportation, and food add up anywhere from 600-800 a month. I would like to turn towards student loans to help ease the financial burden but unfortunately I am unable to consider federal loans and most private loans. I came to America at the age of 4 along with my mother and father  around 15 years ago. Initially we were here on a visitor's visa which soon expired. My parents are now divorced and my father moved back to Korea and essentially vanished from our lives. My only family here in America is my mother who is an alien and my younger sister who was born in America as a citizen. I am currently on DACA which gives me the right to work legally in the US and stay without the fear of deportation. I am working as much as possible around being a full time student but I make barely enough to cover my living expenses let alone pay for school tuition and fees. My mother makes about $25000 a year which is enough to support herself and my sister but not much more to help me pay off the incoming costs of my education. My status does not give me eligibility for FAFSA as I am not an American citizen or permanent resident and neither am I able to get private loans due to not having any adult family members that are citizens. Please I need your advice on how I can continue my education for another 4 years.

-Debt: No debt
-Tax Filing Status: Single
-Tax Rate: 25% Federal, 8.25% State Income

Roth IRA:
52% American Funds Washington Mutual Fund (AWSHX)(5.75% front load, 0.6% expense ratio)

1. Does this asset allocation seem reasonable:
Goal #1: Retirement. I was thinking about a 60% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VTSMX) /30% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares (VGTSX) /10% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VBMFX) 

Goal #2: House. I was thinking about a 40% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VTSMX) /20% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares (VGTSX) /40% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VBMFX) 

If all future contributions are weighted 31% to Goal #1: Retirement and 69% to Goal #2: House, then I anticipate I should be able to reach both goals. My total portfolio allocation would be:

46% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VTSMX) /23% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares (VGTSX) /31% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VBMFX) 

2. What investment vehicles should I use, knowing that I may want to withdraw up to $80K in 7 years?

* 8X $50 Face value issued 03/2001, worth $36.80 each today, will reach final maturity in 08/2027

In total, the bonds are worth $446.20 if cashed in today. I'm currently in the summer before my freshman year of university, with an estimated cost of attendance of $27,000 per year, of which I have $6,400 paid for with scholarships so far. I also have a $3,500 subsidized federal loan and a $2000 unsubsidized federal loan this year, bringing the remainder needing to be paid to $15,000 just for this year alone, of which my parents are offered a ""PLUS"" loan to pay for.

I'm not sure when the money will be of the most use to me. By my senior year of college I anticipate to have at least an entry level position in my field (Mechanical Engineering), so $400-$500 most likely wouldn't be as much money to me then, although that's around the time when my subsidized loans will start needing to be paid off, in addition to my unsubsidized loans already accumulating interest.

Long story short, I really wanted to buy my first car Grand Cherokee today. It's very undervalued at the dealership as its been sitting there for 60 days and overall would be a great purchase. However I don't want to trap myself into a unreasonable interest rate.  I am wanting to make a used car purchase in the next year and need some perspective on going about it the most economically sound way. 

I have about 11K saved that I would be willing to make a down payment on a couple year old Grand Cherokee worth around 24k. If I were to finance about half of it the best rate its looking like I'm going to get would be around 5.9% since I'm a first time buyer, even with my 799 credit score. Obviously this is not something I am interested in and feel this is an outrageous rate. 

Without having 5 credit cards and proving I can pay them all off, Is there anyway I can get around this increased rate and/or lower it?

I understand the premise that I have to prove I can payoff debt to get a good rate. One of my thoughts is to continue to wait, save money like I have over the past year. 

One of my thoughts to avoid paying close to 1k in interest and build my credit (so I'm never again a first time buyer) would to be to wait until i have enough on hand to pay for it outright but still take out the loan and pay it all off in a couple months. Now I understand that sounds outrageous and difficult to conceivably do, that's not my concern. My real question here is would paying that off in a huge sum help my ability to get a cheaper rate eventually? Does the bank have an issue with this?

personalfinance,What order should I pay off my student loans in?,"Yes, I read the FAQ.

I am currently entering my fifth year as a teacher, which means that the majority of my loans will be forgiven at the end of the year. During my five years of teaching, I have kept my loans in forbearance and have paid off very little of them.

Once my loans are forgiven, I will have around $6500 still to pay, across seven different loans. I currently have $3860.57 in AmeriCorps grants that I can use to pay off part of that.

I am thinking I should use my AmeriCorps money now instead of later so that my loans have lower principles (since the loans continue to accrue interest while in forbearance). Is this the right choice?

My loans are split thusly:

* $2821 at 6.8%  
* $624 at 6.8%  
* $6437 at 6%
* $1474 at 5.6%  
* $6916 at 4.5%  
* $2767 at 4.5%  
* $2851 at a variable interest rate  

My initial thought was to pay off the two loans at 6.8% completely and put the remaining ~$400 towards the loan with the 6.0% interest rate, but then I was thinking that 6.8% of $624 is significantly less than 6.0% of $6437. On the other hand, even if I put all my AmeriCorps money into my 6.0% loan, the interest on that is still more than on the $624 loan. And then working in the fact that most of it will be forgiven anyway makes it even more difficult for me to make a decision.

I want to pay the least amount of money overall - is the wisest choice still to pay off the two 6.8% loans even though they're much smaller than the 6.0% loan, or should I put all my AmeriCorps money into the 6.0% loan instead?

After I use my AmeriCorps money, I am thinking I will continue making payments while my loans are in forbearance for the upcoming school year if I have extra money available. What order should I attack the loans with any extra money I have?",finance,1433530629

personalfinance,Emergency: Divorced alcoholic father turns up hospitalized with $100k in medical expenses and psychosis.,"My Dad lives a couple states away. 

After not hearing from him for a couple weeks, I called his cellphone only to find out that it had been disconnected. I called around (friends and places he frequents) and eventually resorted to calling the police non-emergency line and asking them to check on him. Turns out he had fallen in his house and hit his head. He has been hospitalized for two weeks and undergoing treatment for severe alcohol withdrawals.

Over the past few days, his mental state has deteriorated sharply. He firmly believes that his hospitalization is the result of a plane crash in Chicago. Apart from that single discrepancy, he and I had a completely normal conversation just three days ago. He was lucid and responsive, and we were able to carry on as we normally would. 

*Today* I called only to find out that he has been physically restrained (i.e. arms and legs cuffed to the bed). He slurs his speech, and his words are nothing but strings of incoherent paranoid delusions. To make things worse, the doctors say he isn't on **any** medication. The last thing I heard before they hung up on me was my Dad crying and begging them to remove his restraints. 

It seems like he's totally lost it, and I am terrified and depressed.

I finally got someone to estimate the cost of care up to this point, and they said $100,000 (and climbing). My Dad doesn't have health insurance—I begged and begged him to get health insurance last year with no luck. He fully owns his $350,000 house and, assuming nobody has swindled him out of his bank accounts, he has about $300,000 in liquid assets. He apparently has a meeting with a Medicaid representative tomorrow, but I know that while incapacitated he can't make any legal/financial decisions.

personalfinance,A few things that helped me get started on my homebuying process...,"So my wife and I bought a house about 2 years ago. Going into the process we knew nothing. I was confused. I didn’t know where to start, and, most importantly, I didn’t know whose advice I could trust or who was trying to rip us off.

I was so stressed and had this deep fear that some unscrupulous real estate agent or mortgage guy or home inspector was going to fleece us out of our hard-earned money either by not fully negotiating on our behalf, charging us questionable fees or telling us we needed to spend money on unnecessary repairs. The worst part was I felt like we couldn’t trust anyone. I thought we’d end up with a drained bank account and no home to live in.

In an effort to keep others from going through the same thing, I wanted to quickly share with you all some of the first steps you can take today to start yourself down the road to home ownership as well.

First things, first… let’s talk about the 900-pound gorilla in the room… money...

I’m assuming you’re not independently wealthy either and don’t have hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank gathering dust that you can just trade for the keys to your new mansion!

If you’re like me (and most people for that matter!), you’re gonna need a mortgage. 

So here’s where we start: How much can I afford?

Let’s start with the basics… 
We need to ask ourselves some quick questions. Your answers can change later so don’t stress about it or spend a ton of time on this now – just take your best guess and move forward!

The process of securing a mortgage and buying a home is complex one with a lot of variables specific to your individual situation. That being said, let’s do what we can to get the ball rolling.

**Your Monthly Mortgage Payment**

First, we need to figure out how much you can spend a month on housing. Ask yourself:

•	How much do I spend on housing right now?

•	Does this amount work for my budget as a whole?

•	Can I afford to spend more? If so, how much more?

The goal here is to come up with a number you’re comfortable with for your monthly housing expense. Remember, your not locked into this answer! Just figure out your best guess right now and let’s move forward!

Once we get this number we need to get a rough idea of how much of it we can use for our monthly mortgage payment. Remember: as a homeowner a portion of your monthly housing expense will have to be used for property taxes and homeowner’s insurance, so we need to account for that.

Taxes and insurance vary quite a bit from town-to-town and state-to-state, so you’re definitely going to need to fine-tune this later, but for now let’s just come up with a monthly estimate by multiplying our potential home value by 0.1875%.

Stop… let’s make this a bit easier…use the chart below to give yourself an idea.

    Value of   		Rough Estimate of 
    Potential Home	Monthly Tax/Insurance
    $100,000		$188 
    $150,000		$281 
    $200,000		$375 
    $250,000		$469 
    $300,000		$563 
    $350,000		$656 
    $400,000		$750 
    $450,000		$844 
    $500,000		$938 
    $550,000		$1,031 
    $600,000		$1,125 

Ok. Now let’s subtract this amount from our your monthly housing expense. The amount left over is a quick estimate of how much you can afford to pay monthly for your mortgage – write this number down!

**Your Down Payment**

Next, it’s important for you to get a rough idea of how much you can afford to use as a down payment. Remember, the more you can afford to pay for your home up front, the less you’ll have to borrow for your mortgage. This potentially means lower monthly payments because (1) you borrowed less money and (2) the greater your down payment is, as a percentage of your home’s purchase price, the better the mortgage interest rates that are usually available to you.

The ability to make a down payment of 20% of the purchase price is a big hurdle to keep in mind. Putting down less than 20% will usually mean you will need to get private mortgage insurance (PMI) as part of your loan. We don’t really need to go into detail on this right now, but just know that if you put down less than 20% on of the purchase price, your initial mortgage payments will be even greater than they would have been because you will also be paying a monthly PMI premium along with your mortgage payment.

That being said, the first thing to do here is to look at how much total money you currently have in the bank. Based on your personal budget how much of this are you able to use to purchase your home?

Again, there’s no single correct answer for everyone. Most financial advisors recommend having at least several months worth of an “emergency fund” saved up, so you probably wouldn’t want to dip into that. How much do you, personally, need to keep in your account? Take a guess!

Remember, your answer can change, so just take your best shot at a number for now.

Once we have that number we need to account for closing costs and prepaid expenses related to our mortgage and home purchase.

Any way you slice it, there are a bunch of costs associated with buying a home that will ultimately come out of this amount. Things like attorney fees, appraisals, home inspections, title insurance, property surveys, mortgage tax, recording fees and pre-paying part of your property tax and homeowner’s insurance escrows are all costs you’ll need to cover.

Don’t panic though! I know this list can sound totally confusing and overwhelming at first, but stay the course! While these costs can vary widely based on the specifics of your situation, how much you will need to dig into your bank account to cover them can vary just as widely depending on how your loan is structured – you will probably have some options.

**Talking to a Lender**

Once you’ve got your head around the two main numbers (your monthly housing expense and your funds available for down payment and closing costs), it’s time to take your show on the road and talk to a mortgage professional!

I would suggest starting off by speaking to the mortgage guy at the local branch of whatever bank you use. Remember, sitting down with your bank’s mortgage professional or even getting a pre-approval from your bank usually costs you nothing and absolutely does not lock you in to ultimately using that bank for your mortgage or even getting a mortgage at all. 

Think of it as a free class in Mortgages 101 – an opportunity for a professional to look at the specifics of your unique situation, answer any questions you have about the process and give you an idea of what types of loans for which you’d qualify.

Another key part of this process is that the Loan Officer you speak with can run your credit as part of the pre-approval process. Your credit score plays a large part in determining what kinds of loans and rates you’d qualify for, so this is an important blank for you to fill in. If your score is low it’s also great to find that out sooner, rather than later, so you can start taking steps to improve it! 

The other main “ingredients” the Loan Officer about which the loan officer will ask are your monthly income, your total assets (e.g. how much do you have in the bank?), and your liabilities.

For mortgage purposes, your liabilities are looked at on a monthly basis. What are your monthly payments for any loans you currently have – car loans, student loans, etc.? And what are your monthly minimum credit card payments? If you don’t have all this available, don’t sweat it – the loan officer should be able to get all the necessary info from your credit report.

Besides answering all your questions about the mortgage process, the other main goal of this meeting is for you to come away with a realistic idea of your purchase price range. You can’t seriously look for a home if you don’t know how much you can spend on it!

Have your loan officer walk you through estimates for closing costs based on your situation. This will give you a rough idea of how much money you’ll be able to spend on the actual down payment.

Now based on the money you have available for your monthly mortgage payments and the interest rates and loan types for which you’d qualify, ask your loan officer how much you can borrow. Make sure this amount doesn’t result in monthly payments larger than what you’re able to spend.

Add together your potential down payment amount and your potential loan amount. This number is roughly the maximum purchase price you should settle on when looking for your new home.

**Contact your Realtor and get out there!**

Congratulations! You did a bunch of the “heavy lifting” up front so now your ready for the fun part! Armed with your new information, it’s time to start checking out some properties!

Well, there you go – some basic first steps to nailing down your price range! The entire home-buying process is a complicated one, with a lot of moving parts but hopefully this gives you a little clarity on starting the process the right way!	

To anyone thinking about buying a home for the first time, I’d love to hear about your thoughts on the process or any fears or concerns you might have!

What is the one thing that you are most concerned about in the home buying process?

Happy to answer any questions you might have.

personalfinance,Balancing the pros and cons of a balance transfer,"I have $5700in cc debt on two credit cards through BOA. Credit limit is $10,000, so a utilization of 57%.  I have had the oldest account since 2009.  I have a credit score of ~735.  The interest rates on the cards until this morning were 21.99% with a balance of $3,415, and 20.00% with a balance of $2,150.  I asked, and they lowered them to 18% and 17%, respectively.  I am currently paying $622/month and will have them paid off by April of 2016.

A side note, this debt was accrued during the dire straights of graduate school.  I have not used them much since getting a real job.  Accruing debt is no longer an issue.

I am considering opening a new credit card outside of BOA to perform balance transfer.  We have a lot of traveling to do in the next year, &amp; would like a decent rewards travel program.  Additionally, the 0% introductory rate would be great for paying off the balances.  The typical 3% balance transfer fee would be one months interest or so if I left the debt where they are.

My plan is to open a new card, transfer as much as I can to the new card, Close the youngest BOA account (~2 years old), and retain the oldest BOA and new card.

My concerns:  I hope to purchase a house in the next 2 years or so.  I will begin saving for the house as soon as I pay off this debt.  My husband has his own savings, so we should have a decent amount for the down payment.  This was debt I accrued prior to marriage, and do not want to use my husband's savings to pay it off.

I had a hard credit pull ~4 months ago to check my credit after an identity theft scare.  This would be another hard pull, and I don't want to impact my good credit score. How can I assess if opening another line of credit would help or hinder my credit score?

personalfinance,Credit Score Plateau,"Hello PF,

Roughly 8 months ago I finally started to realize the necessity of managing my credit, loans, and personal finance. I've been using Credit Karma as a simple 'check' to gather a ballpark of where my standing is.

I've cut out almost all unnecessary spending (minus maybe $200 month to have fun with for activities/random purchases for myself/GF - which I don't always use).

Here are my current metrics from CK:

- Transunion:
Oct 2014: 444 - June 2015: 569
- Equifax
Jan 2015: 551 - May 2015: 624

Roughly 3 months ago my credit started to plateau (which I expected to same degree but I've only increased by 1 pt per month)

This information brings forth my question. I'm looking to find a way to continue increasing my credit scores so I can help myself buy a car/home someday. I'm currently not in any rush but I want to be prepared for it.

I currently have no credit cards, a few months ago I applied through the credit union that I use but I was denied. They just told me that I'll be approved for any amount under $1,500 as long as I set it up in the sense of a secured card by keeping the credit limit amount in my savings. No big deal for me as I've already got $1,000 in my savings to leverage for this if its the correct choice. The interest rate is 4.9% which is awesome. I can go into more detail if necessary.

The reason for my poor credit is I went to a private college and graduated with nearly 80,000 in loans and missed payments, since then I have not missed a single payment for any of my bills (loans, rent, utilities, braces, etc). I currently try to pay as much as possible to my loans but I pay a static $650 each month and tend to chip in an extra $100-$150 from the $200 savings I listed above.

I also have 3 accounts that I split out my paychecks into:

- Major bank - Checking
- Credit Union - Checking/Savings

Would it be beneficial to leverage the secured card through my credit union and keep my utilization at 30% and below or would it help my case to apply through my ""major bank"" as well to help increase my overall credit.

I have no desires to leverage these cards for any other purpose other than to improve my credit rating and get out of this current plateau and I fully understand to keep my utilization at &gt;30% at all times.

Any information would be greatly appreciated and if you need more information, just ask.

They have this system where they can schedule you all week for ""call-in shifts"" where you have to call-in an hour before your shift to see if they need you, which is bullshit if you have another job because you can't schedule anything on a day you have a call-in, because they might need you, and if they don't need you then that's a day completely wasted. I could have weeks of only these shifts, which might mean zero hours for that job that week, or occasionally, if someone quits (which happens a lot), I will have a month where I'm working 50+ hours a week with hours of standing, lifting heavy boxes up stairs, working until 3 am some nights, and also being forced to keep up with a ridiculous sales quota on top of keeping the entire store together. Keep in mind I am also a part-time student, and I run a makeshift nannying business on the side. 

Now, if that wasn't enough to make me want to quit, I was in an awful car accident about a month ago. Not only did it do a lot of damage to my back, but I am now without a car until it gets fixed. I have let my managers know this several times, but they still schedule me for hours late into the night (I was there one night until 4 am the other night), and put me in the basement with inventory work when I would much rather be on the floor or on the register to protect any future damage to my back. I can't get a ride home from my friends if I get off after midnight, and they know this. I have one manager who is very nice and who I've become very close to, but the other three managers (yes, there are 4 MANAGERS) have been incredibly nonchalant about my accident and lack of transportation. 

So end backstory, I asked for 2 days off for my dad's birthday on May 30th, his birthday is on the 14th so I figured it was well in advance. I go to check my schedule a couple of days ago and I am scheduled, again, until 3 AM for both of the days I requested off. Something kind of snapped in me, I am fed up and exhausted with this job, I dropped two classes for this job, I have done everything they have asked of me, I have never been late or asked for a day off, and for some reason they can't let me off for my dad's birthday, who I haven't seen in years. So I called my manager and said I wasn't coming in anymore, and I went online and sent in my resignation. I realize it's shitty to leave without a two-week notice, but there was no way that I am making my roommate pick me up at 3 am anymore. I have a couple of interviews from jobs that have been emailing me for months that I am going to next week, I'm just a little worried because my boss at my old job keeps calling me. Besides telling me I should have handled this differently, is there anything I need to worry about with my resignation at this place? I'm just really anxious about it even though I'm sure I'll never see these people again. 
tl;dr: Angrily quit retail job without two-week notice, worried about the repercussions.

I've got an auto loan.  It was a 72 month loan, payments are $189 a month, I'm down to 48 months left.  These payments are possible for me to do, but Credit Karma says it sees a new loan option for me.  This new loan brings me back to 72 months, but monthly payments are $127 and the interest rate lower.  After the 72 months, I'd pay $6 more in interest - a number I could easily bypass by contributing, say $140 a month instead of just the minimum.

I feel like this would be beneficial for me in the long run.  I'd save money overall, and while I'd be extending the loan by a couple years, isn't it a good thing to have accounts open for your credit score?  My dad thinks it would be stupid for me to do so.

gaming,Small Compilation of Fallout 4 Predictions and Theories,"In light of the Fallout 4 trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE2BkLqMef4, people have been making several theories and predictions, which I'm just compiling a few and listing them all here, plus a few of my own. Add if you have any, or have heard of any not listed!

1. The main character is from the past, before the Great War, and was cryogenically frozen in Vault 111, near Boston. People are pointing out that the couple from (1:07) in the video could very well be the main templates of the player character in the game, a pair of new parents. Fans say this because the male in particular looks an awful like the lead male drawing in this old casting call, an old leak of Fallout 4 about a couple months old, which was dismissed as a rumor. The source site for the supposed leak was Kotaku. (http://imgur.com/gallery/LVPGp/new).

2. The garage in the background of the Fallout 4 website (www.fallout4.com), as well as at the end (2:15) of the video is the player's base, a garage and house with a crafting bench. Also seen is a possible piece of Power Armor that the player could be salvaging parts or building from scratch or broken bits and pieces.

3. Three-Dog will make a return. Given that Boston isn't incredibly far from the Capital Wasteland, Three Dog might come back on the airwaves, or as a character. Erik Todd Dellums has been tweeting several times about his hopes for being in a new Fallout, but has gone silent about it for a little while. Plus, at (2:00), you can see a poster for GNN (Galaxy News Network), the media company that ran the Galaxy New Radio (GNR), that Three-Dog hosted.

4. The Mysterious Stranger will be present in the game. He's been in 1, 2, 3, and NV, and it's expected the Perk character will return. At (1:40), he's seen walking under a streetlight in a city, one that's populated, based on the sheet-metal walls, keeping the horrors of the world out. In a very noir-style scene, he walks to the camera, as it rains in front of theater. Now, this is could be another character, but the lighting signifies his/her importance, and the trenchcoat and wide-brimmed fedora are hallmarks of the Stranger.

Some of my Theories and Predictions:

1. Going back to that first theory, I believe the house that Dogmeat is combing through in the trailer is the of course the player character's old house. If the 1st theory is true, then it must be the old house. In that case, when Dogmeat runs out to go find the player character near what appears to be his current home/garage, then perhaps the player character was visiting his old house before he got separated from Dogmeat? After they reunited, he says, ""Let's go, pal."" Perhaps there's a potentially emotional scene in the game regarding a walk down memory lane?

2. Given the setting in Boston, the Institute will likely be a key faction and location. But, in the trailer, we also the the Brotherhood of Steel. Given that by definition, both groups are the same (A secretive group dedicated to old world technology), they'll be war with one another. The Institute focuses more on adapting old world tech into new fields and uses, such as Androids (which is unknown as to their purpose?). The Brotherhood focuses on the preservation of old world tech in the name of keeping the wastes safe from the wrong hands, but in some Chapters, for their own benefit, which can be fueled by less than noble ambitions. Perhaps a war that the players can choose what side they're on? Even to a point where we can learn about what's going on behind the walls of the Institute.

3. One of the games major themes will be old American history. As in, Revolutionary era history. Boston is an old town with alot of history buried under the rubble. At one point in the trailer (1:57), we can see a statue of Paul Revere. Beyond the possibility of wielding a musket (ala Lincoln's Repeater), this could be a major theme and background that provides reflection and context to the story. Given my prediction of a war, perhaps there will be connections to real life events, of morals of Patriotism. Maybe the people of the Commonwealth want to throw off the chains of the Institution? Like parallels to the decadence of Rome w/ New Vegas, or how the Legion would turn on itself if it ever reached the coasts of the West, this could be philosophical. (I'd also love to visit Salem, and there be a Witch-hunt/trial-esque quest.)

4. Nuclear winter will finally come. Boston is cold. It's also far North, and there might be seasons added. Perhaps snowstorms and other threats like negative temperatures and the like.

personalfinance,How do I allocate taxable accounts if I don't have major expenses planned?,"Hi all,

I'm a financially stable 26 year old, and am wondering how to manage my taxable investments - of which I currently have none.

* I max my IRA - going on for several years. (~25k in Vanguard 2055 Target Fund)
* I max my 401k - upped to max contribution a few months ago. (~15k in 30% small cap, 30% mid cap, 30% large cap, 5% short term federal fund, 5% intermediate term bond - all vanguard)
* My HSA isn't maxed, but the next opportunity I have to modify it, I will max it.
* I rent, and have no set plans to purchase a house.
* Historically, I have hopped cities and jobs (generic programming/analytics) quite a bit. I'm not sure when this will end.
* Sometimes I take breaks between 'real' jobs and travel / visit friends and family while doing low-paying or pro-bono research.
* I still don't feel the need to 'settle down', and have limited belongings.
* I have about ~2000 a month surplus after taxes and average expenditures.
* I've got 18,000 sitting in my checking account, doing nothing.
* No education debt (thank you, mom and dad!)
* A paid-off '05 civic with ~130k miles that I picked up last year, and seems to be surprisingly healthy.


I've seen lots of advice for how to store money if one is planning on placing a downpayment in X years, or if one is planning on going to school in Y years, or if one is planning on FI/RE in Z years. The thing is, I have no idea what I'm planning for.

I'm not really sure what I'll be doing in 6 months, but something that involves making a similar or higher salary (or maybe even taking a break between jobs) is pretty likely. But who knows, my history has been pretty varied and maybe I'll end up blowing a bunch of money on something silly, like more education or attempting to start a business or whatever.

I have a few questions regarding how to handle my money after taxes:

* If I want to effectively invest in a taxable account based on appropriate risk, do I have to figure out some sort of financial road map? Is it time to grow up and make some plans?
* Obviously doing something is better than losing value to inflation. I might say that I'm pretty darn sure I'm several years away from potential large expenditures.

  House: Probably at least 3 years a very-significant-other away from even wanting one, and I figure I can hold out a couple more while doing research and maybe diverting payments from retirement accounts to a downpayment fund.

  Grad school: If I were to do it (unlikely), it's at least 2 years away.
* If I take on medium-risk investments with a portfolio that includes bonds, do I have to redo my entire portfolio in order to minimize taxes on dividends? I value the ease of having my target accounts. Is that over now that I have to think about [tax efficient fund placement](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement)?
* When I start investing in taxable accounts, should I slowly start adding funds over time to mitigate risk from an unexpected economic downturn? I'm not trying to time the market, but just be safe - especially with money that isn't necessarily for retirement.
* How do you weigh in on [investing 130% of a safety fund](https://www.betterment.com/resources/personal-finance/safety-net-funds-why-traditional-advice-is-wrong/)? I figure I'd need about 10k to live a very relaxed and medium quality of life year while unemployed.

personalfinance,Consolidating CC debt - two options. Credit union loan vs loan from friend. Plus additional questions,"I have ~$10,800 in various credit card debts.  Some of the interest scenarios are

* High interest (24%) card holding ~$5000 (but ~2500 is balance transfer interest free)
* CareCredit balance of 1460 that is interest free until this December
* The rest of the cards are between 9% and 19%

I was at my credit union and they offer a loan targeting credit card consolidation.  Their breakdown of credit score range vs offered interest rate range will likely put me at $10k loan @ ~12.5% for 60 months.  This sounds like a good opportunity to save a significant amount of money over the life of my debt (assuming no new spending.)

I was discussing with a friend of mine (male, 70 yrs, retired, very thrifty and no money problems.)  He thought it sounded good too.  But he then offered me the same $10k for only 6%.  This can be over the same 60 months, or we can adjust it to 36 months (this allows me to pay off quicker, obviously, but has me shelling out the same amount each month as I currently do, which is fine.)

As to the debt that would be consolidated.

* I would NOT include the CareCredit.  I can pay that off by Dec and pay no interest at all, instead of putting it under the consolidation
* Is it possible, for the larger card that currently has half the balance interest free - can I target pay just the interest balance?  Is that something that credit companies offer?

If I borrow from my friend
* I'm thinking I will have to report that $10k as income, correct?
* If he pays the cards directly - would it still be income?

One of the other big concerns, of course, is putting this large amount of money between friends.  It would be up to me to decide if that was a good thing.  But I would hear any concerns PF might bring up.

To wrap it up - are either of these options good?  Pros and cons?  Am I overlooking a facet of the credit union consolidation that would bite me later?",finance,1433603910

personalfinance,"190k in student loans. Unsure of refinancing (ie. SOFI, DRB) or IBR.","Hi everyone,

New redditor and recent med school grad about to start a 3 year residency in CA. I’ve been reading different student loan repayment options and the two that seem the most popular are IBR and private loan refinancing (ie. Sofi, DRB). I see pros and cons to both but since I don’t have a background in personal finance so I could really use some advice/help.  

I will be netting ~$3k-3.5k per month during my 3 year residency and hope to spend around half on living expenses and the other half on paying back my student loans. I know a lot say to keep government loans bc of the additional options (ie. deferment/forbearance, PSLF/IBR/PAYE), but as of right now I don’t plan on utilizing PSLF and don’t want to wait 25 years to have my loans forgiven through IBR. 

**My current loan situation:**

Total Loans: 188k at 6.622% (174k principal, 14k accrued interest)
Tax filing status: Single
Yearly income: 50k 

Loan 1: Direct Plus, $46k, 7.9% interest.
Loan 2: Direct Unsub Stafford, 52k, 6.8% interest.
Loan 3: Direct Plus, $41k, 6.4% interest.
Loan 4: Direct Unsub Stafford, 49k, 5.4% interest.

**Different ways to pay back loans:**

**Option 1:** 10 Year Standard Repayment. Not feasible with monthly payment ~2000 month. 

**Option 2:** IBR with prepayment toward principal. With this, I would be paying ~$450 per month and can put $1000 toward the principal. This seems like a decent option bc my monthly payments would be minimal to cover any living expenses and I can pay whatever I have left (hopefully around $1000) toward the principal on my highest interest loan (avalanche method). Only caveat is that online it says that prepaying with IBR payments is not recommended because of the way that IBR handles interest. Can someone clarify why this is so?

**Option 3:** Loan consolidation through private loan (DRB vs SOFI). I have good credit (&gt;720). Hypothetically assuming I get a 15 year, 5% fixed loan I would be paying around $1500/month. In this case, I would be lowering my avg 6.6% loans to 5%. The lower interest rates at the 5 yr and 10 yr variable/fixed plans don’t seem realistic for me to pay back monthly at &gt;$2000/month. I could also do a variable interest plan at a lower rate and pay it off faster which may make it less risky. There is also a DRB plan I read about on WhiteCoatInvestor where they simulate an IBR plan where you pay ~$100/month as a resident up to 6 months as an attending (no capitalization on interest) then you start making increased payments 6 months after graduating residency. I couldn't find additional information on DRB's website. Any thoughts on variable vs fixed and repayment length and this DRB plan. The 5 yr variable plans are the lowest, but I don't think I can even come close to making the monthly payments on those.

**Option 4:** Combination of both IBR and loan consolidation. I would consolidate my two highest interest loans 7.9% and 6.8% down to 4.5% at DRB on a 10 year, fixed repayment plan paying around $1000 monthly. Then I would do IBR on my two lowest interest loans and pay ~450/month (15% of my discretionary income). I would keep some IBR just so that I can go into deferment in the slight chance that I go through financial hardships. Whatever I have left, I would add towards my highest interest loan.

personalfinance,business share options and the resulting tax minefield,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I'm looking for some advice regarding my upcoming financial situation. Hoping you guys/gals can impart some wisdom on how best to manage it. I have learnt a lot from the subreddit and now i'm hoping you fine people can help out!

I am a 30yo male who moved to New York 2.5 years ago to help setup the US arm of our UK business. We work in VFX and create commercials for TV. In that time i have worked my way up to director and am now the recipient of share options in the business with a base salary of $130k. I hold no personal financial responsibility for the business FYI. The ultimate goal is to sell the business within the coming 18 months at which point the share options will be exercised. 

I have 3.75% in share options and after a lot of splitting, distributing and number crunching it amounts to somewhere in the region of $400k before tax. There's a lot of variables that go into calculating that number, not least of all the final sale cost of the business. Needless to say it's no small chunk of change and i want to manage it correctly. Depending on the terms of sale the money would be paid over the course of 3-4 years in 3 phases. I would receive around 50% at the point of sale, and then a further payment of 30% in year 2 and the final 20% in year 3 or 4. I have to remain in the business for the full 3/4 years to acquire all the funds. 

This is where i'm looking for some advice! My current plan is to look to purchase property (NJ) in the coming 18 months due to favorable interest rates. I have around $75k for a deposit at present. Ultimately, i'm looking at the best, most tax effective way of acquiring the share options and maximizing return. Does anyone have any previous experience with such a scenario? I have been looking online but have found it challenging to find any definitive information on how best to proceed. I am yet to fully understand how the share options will be paid whether that be through payroll or elsewhere. If it goes through payroll i may not have much in the way of control over the tax? Do i get income tax and also capital gains on top? The business has mentioned figures of around 40% (ouch) so i could stand to lose a fair chunk. 

I have very little knowledge of the US tax system and before seeking out a financial adviser i would love to hear any thoughts pertaining to the situation and how best to maximize the return from the money. Happy to answer anymore questions if i have left out vital info.

Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,Unsure about fitting life insurance into long term goals,"Me: 34 year old male. Making ~ $75k /year in a teamster job. Wife is 26, soon to be going back to nursing school, she wont be working for at least another 3 years. Daughter is 18 months. We are all in excellent health.

We are slowly rebuilding our credit scores (680ish) and savings account ($2000) by using a prepaid credit card (spending 1/3rd of the limit and paying it off each month) and putting about $200/week into a savings account.

We want to buy a house ASAP. A modest, but certainly suitable home in the area is 150k.

My current life insurance plan offers 15k whole life, 193k term (10 years), 200k accelerated death, 15k terminal illness, and 15k WP (I don't know what this is??) for $165/month.  

I recently spoke with a rep about lowering my monthly bill and, like any good salesperson, he told me how it would be a good idea to raise my bill instead. He suggested I convert $100,000 of term life coverage into whole life to make it $115k, and drop the remaining $93k of term life completely. This would raise my bill to $185/month, but in 3 years I would be able to ""borrow"" (I use quotes because I apparently will never have to pay it back) against it to help buy a house. Furthermore, whole life has a 5% interest rate that compounds annually.

Essentially, he pitched it as a savings account with a 5% compounding interest rate, and oh yeah it comes with life insurance too. This seems like its EXACTLY what I want, which makes me skeptical. 

Is there any reason why I shouldn't do like he suggested? What does PF think?",finance,1433620607

What do I gain by paying as much federal tax as I possibly can. Basically, overstating my income relative to my available write-offs. There seem to be some interesting benefits. 1. I can gain a larger loan on property at low interest rates. 2. Social security will be higher (it is based on your highest income years, right?). 3. Disability payments will be higher if needed.

I took a serious look at my finances and started making hefty payments, with over half of my monthly salary going toward loans each month.

financialindependence,Sharing my goals and journey,"Excited to find this subreddit and though I'd make a hello post to share my goals and journey.

I'm 37 and my dream is to become financially independent as soon as possible. I'm married with one child, hopefully another to come, and a stay at home partner.

Workwise I made a big career change over the last four years to move to more meaningful and enjoyable work. It has cost me a lot of money but two months ago I started a new job on my highest ever salary after years spent studying and working my way up the ladder in a new area. I'm really proud of what I've achieved there. 

Financially we bought a place for 1.2 million last year (in Australian dollars) with a 550k loan and 110k in cash in an offset account. So we have a total of 440k mortgage debt outstanding.

There are no tax free savings vehicles in Australia outside of retirement savings accounts which have a lot of limits on when they can be accessed. Work pays the mandatory 9.5% in to that retirement account anyway and the limits on access (have to be 65+ with some drawdown possible before) means I am not going to add to that.

Mortgage interest rates are high relative to the US and UK. We are paying 4.5% on a 30 year repayment. Stamp duty is high (4%) and housing costs in the cities are high so while the mortgage is large I'm happy it will save us a lot long term. We have a great house, within walking distance of the CBD, with plenty of space for a family. So we should only need to move again when downsizing.

Income wise. I currently earn 6,800 net monthly with another 1,200 net of potential bonus. I also earn some side income from a hobby. Last year it was 7k gross, this year probably about 5k. When I retire I think I could expand that.

Savings wise, I have about 120k invested in the stock market mainly in more high risk stuff. If I invest more there then I'm just going to go for a low fee tracker. I also have around 160k in retirement accounts but I don't really count them due to the age restrictions.

Going forward I'm considering where to put the salary hike from the new job. Each month I pay 2500 in to a joint account with my wife. 1750 is for mortgage 750 is for expenses. She pays in 1500 with a 750, 750 split. The 1500 pays for all our joint expenses (with plenty leftover usually).

I then use 800 as walking about money for myself and I save the remaining 3500. My big decision at the moment is whether to put this in the stock market or as an overpayment on the mortgage and I am 90% going to do the latter. I think I'll do a 3500 monthly overpayment to make 42k a year and then, if bonus and side business delivers, round that up to 50k. With our existing repayment we should take 60k off the mortgage every year with that.

Spending wise, I'm pretty frugal. I walk to work every day, we have an old car my wife drives. We usually eat out or get takeaway one or twice a week. I buy some snacks and a few things for hobbies but don't spend much. I am trying to take a packed lunch to work as much as possible but it can be hard to get organised!

So that's me! Hopefully I'm on the right path. Look forward to reading this sub and would love to hear any comments on my plans!",finance,1433640120

personalfinance,I'm in way over my head with debts and I have no idea how to begin digging myself out,"All of my life I've been an ignorant person towards finances, I've never had a respect for money. I don't come from a wealthy family but whenever I've needed to borrow an amount of money, friends and banks have always been welcoming with arms wide open. As a result of this, I've continued my entire life abusing this avenue and it's finally gotten to a point where I need to admit defeat and ask for help.

Let me preface my current situation with a brief history of my finances:
From the age of 14 - 18, I had a few friends that would loan me money. I worked an after-school job during these years and would borrow amounts ranging from $5 - $1000 at any one time. I was consistently doing payday loans with interest of 20-30% because I was foolish and ridiculously impatient. Fast forward to 18, I've left school and am 3 months into a full-time job working at a hotel. At this point I do not have any debts, I'm living with my parents and paying $75 a week rent from the $400 I earned. Being the naive person I am, I decide its a good Idea to take a bank loan for $10000 to buy a new car that I really wanted. Over the next 2 years I accumulate another $7000 in credit card debt and am working full-time as a tradesmen. After I turned 20, I sold the car and used the money to help lower my debt. 1 year passes and I've brought the original $17000 debt down to about $7500. At this point in my life I decide its a good idea to move overseas and start fresh. I moved to Australia from NZ and continue working here as a tradesmen. A year goes by in Australia and I've successfully payed off all my NZ debt and for the first time in my life I have no money owing. For the next 6 months I live close to paycheck to paycheck, saving a little bit but not much. I apply for a credit card here in Australia and tell myself I'm going to use it sensibly and build some credit, paying back the repayments each month on time. I accidentally applied for 2 credit cards at once due to my first application crashing when my internet cut out. The bank received both applications anyway and approves one for $14,000 and the other for $10,000.

As you'd expect, this all goes horribly wrong and here I am with $14,000 worth of debt across two credit cards.
I'm 24 yrs old with no savings and have no idea how to rectify these financial habits and pay off my debt.

-I earn approximately $700 AUD pw
-Outgoings such as rent/bills/petrol is $350 pw
-Remaining $350 I usually blow on frivolous things, occasionally paying minimum CC repayments

-CC 1 has $8k owing with a limit of $14k
-CC 2 has $6k owing with a limit of $10k
-Both cards have an annual interest rate of 14%

So I really would like if someone here could help me do a budget so I can start digging myself out of this shit hole I've created for myself.

business,A Six-Point Plan to Restore US Economic Growth and Prosperity,"By John Mauldin and Stephen Moore

The dismal news of 0.2% GDP growth for the first quarter only confirmed that the US is in the midst of its slowest recovery in half a century from an economic crisis.

Could it be that at least some of the rage we've seen in the streets of Baltimore is a result of a paltry recovery that hasn't benefited low-income inner-city areas?

We are at least $1.5 trillion a year behind where we would be with even an average post-World War II recovery.

While many blame a lack of sufficient demand and even insufficient government spending, our view is that the primary factors behind the growth slowdown are an increasingly intrusive regulatory environment, a confusing and punitive tax scheme, and lack of certainty over healthcare costs.

Each of these factors has contributed to a climate where growth is slow and incomes are stagnant. These are problems that cannot be solved by monetary and fiscal policy alone.

To get real growth and increased productivity, we need to deal with the real source of economic progress: the incentive structure.

The coming presidential race offers an opportunity for candidates to put forth concrete and comprehensive ideas about what can be done to create higher economic growth – as opposed to platitudes and piecemeal ideas that don't address the entire problem.

The two of us have met with several candidates and discussed tax reform and other economic growth issues. We offer here some solutions of our own for them to consider.

1. Streamline the federal bureaucracy. Government has become much like the neighbor who has hoarded every magazine and odd knick-knack for 50 years. The attic and every room are stuffed with items no one would miss. The size of the US code has multiplied by over 18 times in 65 years. There are more than 1 million restrictive regulations.

Enough already. It's time to clean out the attic. The president, with some flexibility, should require each agency to reduce the number of regulations under its purview by 20%, at the rate of 5% a year. And then Congress should pass a sunset law for the remaining regulations, requiring them to be reviewed at some point in order to be maintained.

Further, if new rules are needed, then remove some old ones. Stop the growth of the federal regulatory code. We have enough rules today; let's just make sure they're the right ones.

2. Simplify and flatten the income tax. Make the individual income rate 20% (at most) for all income over $50,000, with no deductions for anything. Reduce the corporate tax to 15%, again eliminating all deductions other than what is allowed by standard accounting practice. No perks, no special benefits.

Further, tax foreign corporate income at 5%–10%, and let companies bring it back home to invest here. This strategy will actually increase tax revenues.

3. Replace the payroll tax with a business transfer tax of 15%, which will give lower-income workers a big raise. Companies would pay tax on their gross receipts, minus allowable expenses in the conduct of producing goods and services.

Nearly every economist agrees that consumption taxes are better than income taxes. Further, this tax can be rebated at the border, so it should encourage domestic production and be popular with union workers since it makes US products more competitive internationally.

4. Provide certainty by keeping tax rates low through a tax-limitation constitutional amendment that would require future tax increases to be passed by 60% of the Congress, in combination with a balanced-budget amendment.

We realize that implementation of these measures could be somewhat jarring, so we'd suggest phasing them in over four to five years – more than enough time for everyone to adjust.

5. Roll back the regulatory state. Recognize that many federal agencies are still mired in the mid-20th century if not the 19th. It's time to design a regulatory system that fosters jobs and growth while protecting citizens.

Let's start with the easy target: the Food and Drug Administration. The United States is the wellspring of biotechnological research, yet more and more of our original research is being taken overseas for further development, producing jobs outside the US

A bipartisan commission can design a new agency with a new regulatory regime and bring it to the floor of Congress for a vote. Instead of a system that makes drug-creation prohibitively expensive, favors Big Pharma and exports jobs, let's harness the power of US entrepreneurs.

Streamline the process so healthcare can keep up with research, thereby lowering healthcare costs and providing healthier outcomes for everyone. Then start with the next regulatory agency until all have been updated.

6. Drill for America's domestic energy and use the royalties on federal lands to retire the debt and/or fund needed infrastructure repair instead of raising taxes. An estimated $2 trillion of royalties and other fees could be raised by drilling on non-environmentally sensitive lands, and this would reduce US reliance on foreign oil while breaking the financial back of many terrorist networks.

Growth is the solution to nearly every social, economic, and financial problem in America, and we aren't getting enough of it. This is a plan that puts US competitiveness first and brings middle-class jobs back to America. We are eager to see which candidates – in either party – embrace this prosperity agenda.",finance,1433663525

economy,Ben Bernanke Says Fed Can’t Get Caught Up in Inequality Debate,"Former US Federal Reserve Bank Chairman and Princeton Economics Professor Ben Shalom Bernanke says that the Fed cannot get caught up in the wealth inequality debate?  Considering it was the US Federal Reserve Bank that aided such increased inequality by it's various policies to bail-out and assist the insolvent US Financial institutions, this is a very interesting commentary indeed.  Sort of like a pyromaniac refusing to discuss the aftermath of an abandoned warehouse fire.  Although in the case of the Fed, real people were involved.

Mr. Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute opines that: While the Fed drove up stock prices, most of which are owned by the wealthy, it also increased the value of housing, which is mostly owned by the middle class (end of quote).

So, in short, these central bank rescues of the financial sector indirectly benefited owners of real estate and equities, which tend to be assets more likely to be owned by the somewhat more affluent.  So, while it was Central Bank and the politicians that have increased the current wealth inequalities we are now seeing, such is an inconvenient truth.  You are not going to find any politician or central banker apologizing to the general public for what they have done (no one in their right mind wants to be voluntarily tarred and feathered).  Remember, it was the banks and other financial institutions that were to be rescued, the general economy and everyone else be damned.  

Helicopter Ben himself has publicly said: The (uncertain) distributional impact of monetary policy should not prevent the Fed from pursuing its mandate to achieve maximum employment and price stability, thereby providing broad benefits to the economy. The impact on inequality was beside the point.  And if there is a negative impact, it should be offset by fiscal policy.  (Thank you Ben for that heart warming explanation, and thank you for letting us know the Fed plans to screw up the collateral damage through more so-called fiscal policy).",finance,1433678949

I'm thinking of just investing the cash in a similar way to the rest of my portfolio, with less of a concentration on bond funds and int'l stocks. So some extra SPDR and then just add to my positions in various vanguard funds. Maybe $10k on a new REIT, my old one was nothing but disappointment (especially given the current market conditions).

original:
25/m/ca, currently have $100k of cash rotting in my savings account that I'm deciding what do to with. I'm budgeting to max out my IRA and 401k, and I have tens of thousands already in taxable investment funds already. I have the cash because of a large investment 'purge' last month I decided to take profits on individual stocks that I no longer care about as well as portions of certain index funds, and my REITs have been tanking so I decided to liquidate that too. I'm budgeting to save at a clip of 33% of take-home pay, and I'm fine with that.

Anyway, I've come across an ""opportunity"" to contribute my $100k along with 7 others i know (friends, friends of friends) toward an $800k down payment on an apartment complex. it's 20% down, 80% financed at 3.99%. The annual cash on cash return is estimated to be ~10% assuming a 90% occupancy rate.

The only other thing I'd do with this cash is stuff it all in SPDR  and call it a day. 

**EDIT:thanks for the initial thoughts, everyone. This does sound like a tremendous pain in the butt; the only reason I'm even considering this is because having 90% of my money in equities feels so passe. My brain thinks that having some physical real estate would help round out the diversification of sources of income: job, dividends/coupons, rental income!

regarding the return, historically the apt has had ~95% occupancy and rarely below 90%, so the 10% return seems fairly ""safe"" and easy to maintain (the interest rate is fixed, so aside from maintenance costs as them come up, costs will be pretty flat). The 8 of us would enter into the purchase with an ""intent to buy and hold""... to help this we've written up 4-year lock-out periods for withdrawing investments, with sufficient notice. That said, I don't know how hard it would be to buy out the other investors down the line... I don't see much upside to the property value unless we try to make it better (we won't), so either way I see this as a ""rental income"" play, and only that. 

As some have pointed out... it sounds like a lot to put into one property. anyone have any experience partnering with others? horror stories or constructive advice is welcome!",finance,1433682133

personalfinance,$120k in student debt; pay-off fast or invest?,"Long time lurker, first time posting.

I'm 30 years old, unmarried, and I work in finance (but not in the realm of personal investing). I went back to school 2.5 year ago, and I have about $120k in student debt outstanding (private loans / 3.25% floating interest rate based on LIBOR). Before tax, I make $150k a year in base salary, with a performance-based bonus that can be anywhere between 20%-100% of my base. After tax, I make about $7,500 a month.

For the last 6 months, I've been aggressively paying down my student loans. I originally had over $150k in debt, and have worked it down to around $120k (payments of ~$4k a month). But after discussing my situation with a friend, he advised me that I shouldn't be paying down the debt so quickly. In his opinion, I should be investing some or all of my excess cash (after making the minimum monthly payment on my debt). His logic: as my interest rate is pretty low, the return that my money would see in the market over time will more than cover the incremental interest I would pay on my student loans, were I to simply pay the minimum each month.

I love the idea of paying down my loans quickly, but this seems to make some sense. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1433700513

Once I reach $81,000 I can request to cancel my PMI, saving me $40 a month which I could divert to the principal payment.

Once I get the mortgage down to around $70k I should quality for a conventional loan but I don't know when I'd be able to do this.  There is some chance I will be selling an investment property this year or within the next 2 years and might have enough then.

**FHA Streamline refinance:**

Advantages:

&gt;I can use the original appraisal from 2009 which still values the home at $101k. Interest rates are around 4% right now. Somewhat lower payment.

Disadvantages:

&gt;FHA rules have changed since 2009 and would require me to pay 1.5% of the loan's principal as an upfront insurance principal.  In addition, the PMI will be permanent for the life of the loan (until I pay it off or refinance).  Also according to FHA rules I can't refinance from 30 yrs to 15 yrs.  Someone please correct me if I or my mortgage broker is wrong.

Refinancing fees or around $3k.

Resetting of the amort schedule.

personalfinance,23 years old and feel like my financial future is doomed. (Serious),"Hi, been a long time lurker, finally decided to try and get some advice for my situation. I feel as if I made huge mistakes in regards to debt and student loans. This is where I stand as of now, and would GREATLY appreciate any advice to help me through this. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post.


I am 23 years old, in my Senior year of a 4 year Bachelors Nursing program (BSN).

As for my Student Loan debt:

Deferred interest of the loans: 6370.37
Grand Total Owed: 60,460.75
(Going to go up at least another 10,000 this year for my last 2 semesters)

Federal Student Loan Debt: 21,500 with 514.00 in interest.

I owe 3,446.47 in credit cards.

I have 100 in my checking and 400 in my savings.

My FICO score is 690 (Which went down from 770 a few months ago, I am assuming my outstanding debt is hurting my score).
I am not sure where to go or what to do. I feel as if I am drowning. I am hoping to make anywhere between 75,000 and 90,000 annually within 1-2 years from graduating this year.

personalfinance,Ginnie Mae (GNMA) fund or short term bond fund for fixed income portion of portfolio,"I'm currently a bit heavy in equities and am looking to allocate at least 10% of my portfolio to more stable securities. However, I hate the idea of having a chunk of money sitting around not growing and hope to put it somewhere that is both 1) reasonably safe in a bad market, and 2) has the highest possible returns for this type of investment.

I've been deciding between a short term bond fund and a Ginnie Mae fund. For those not familiar with Ginnie Maes (GNMAs), they are mortgage-backed securities backed by the US government, so they carry no credit risk. Their historic returns are consistently a few percentage points higher than the bond funds. I'm inclined to buy but I'd like to get your guys' thoughts beforehand. What do you think?

As an extra part of this question, with interest rates set to rise, is one of these choices better suited to survive the hike?",finance,1433708322

personalfinance,Should I refinance student loans with lower variable rate to pay back faster before rate rise?,"I am lucky enough to be in the world of Tech near a major metropolitan area that has lead to my salary growing from 65k last summer to over 85k starting in two weeks with a new job.  I will also be cashing out my vacation time from my old job to pay off my first student loan (seriously excited about this), and using the sign on bonus from the new job to pay off a second. In addition my old company wants to keep me on as a consultant for the possibility of more income as their hourly rate is $70/hr.  Granted this could be one hour a month or possibly 4 hours a week, I have no idea yet.

This got me to thinking about refinancing my federal student loans now that my credit is hovering between 750-754 (according to credit karma).  The rates on my loans aren't incredibly high but I have about $27.5k left at 3.55% to 6.55%, most are at 6.55%, there is about $8k at 3.55-5.5%.

After seeing some banks proposing variable rates as low as 1.9% that got me thinking about possibly refinancing and saving on interest so I can pay off my loans even faster.  

The catch being, could I get a rate low enough and for long enough to make it worth while.  Interest rates are poised to shoot back up but I have no idea how high they will go or when.  I saw something about some European banks urging the US to wait until 2016 to start raising rates but its a gamble. 

Once my other loans are paid off I will be looking to put about $1,300 a month on this loan plus anything I gain from consulting.  If I can talk my roommate into moving into a 3BR with another person I could potentially put $1600/mo on the loan but that is also a big *if*.

personalfinance,"On Social Security Disability, trying to figure out how to make non-employment income without losing benefits or incurring Student Loans.","I am 38 years old, and on Social Security Disability. This grants me roughly $600 a month. Because that figure is so low, the state gives me an additional $200 in Supplemental Security Income, and a monthly food stamp credit of $200. If I didn't live with my boyfriend who pays 2/3 the rent and 2/3 the food, I'd never survive. 

I tried going back to school a few years ago. One year of crap college has gotten me about $15,000 in debt. While I've gotten the payments deferred due to being below the poverty level, I'm still wracking up interest (which is such total bullshit). I have to get a doctor to fill out a form stating that I am indeed Disabled (because they don't take my Federal status as deemed Disabled through a court hearing as evidence enough, which is also bullshit). If the Fed Loan gods decide my paperwork is up to snuff, my loans will be dismissed. HOWEVER, for the following three years I cannot make more than $15,000 annually, or the loans will be reinstated.

I am hardly surviving. I cannot keep a regular job, because of variable health issues that cannot be predicted. 

I keep trying to figure a way out of this crappy situation. I might be able to figure out something I could do at my own pace to generate income, but for every dollar I get, regardless of source, I get 50cents less from SSI. So if I make $400, I'll not get the SSI, nor will I get the food stamps (I think), and I'll be just as poor as I started, which is pretty freakin' poor.

If, through employment, I make more than $800 (roughly) more than seven times in a five year period though earned income, I'll be removed from Disability. However, I can make as much as I like through UNearned income, and keep the Disability.

But again, if I make more than $15,000 annually, my Student loans will return. 

Do I just wait the three years? Are there any long term investments I could make now with very little money, that could pay off in years to come? I don't want to just sit still being poor. I'd like to be proactive about improving my situation, but I don't want to put myself in a worse situation than I already am.

My father owns a two family house, which doesn't make much money, due to expensive property taxes in NJ. I was considering proposing to him that he sell me 51% of it through a rent-to-own plan. Living there as a person on Disability, I believe I'd qualify for a very reduced property tax rate. That increase property income could help pay off the deposit for the house, and by the time I paid off enough of a deposit, the three years should be up! Right?

That was the only idea I've been able to come up with, and I don't know that there's enough incentive for my dad to want to do such a thing.

My only other thought was to generate some kind of investment fundraiser and start a Special Needs Trust, but I'm afraid the Fed Loan folks would come after that.",finance,1433715431
personalfinance,My CD just matured. Should I renew?,"Three of my grandparents died in the span of a few months last year and left me about nine grand inheritance combined. 

I work two jobs and do well enough for myself. I save money every month in both my checking account and savings account, I have an emergency fund of a couple thousand in cash hidden in my room, I pay off my credit card every month in full, and have no school debt.
  I didn't really trust myself with this money so I put it into a 12-17 month CD with an interest rate of .45%. A year later and I still don't really want to touch this money. I'm thinking about renewing it except the CD gets a lower interest rate than my savings account (.55%). Is it worth it to renew it or should I just take it all out and throw it into my savings account? Would there be tax implications for doing that? I don't have a job that would provide a retirement fund to pay into. 
I'd really just like an option that would accrue the most interest without losing it in taxes preferably without my having direct access. If it was possible to just dig a hole and throw it in and have it make me more money I'd do that.

personalfinance,Grad student looking for some private loan advice,"Hey guys,

I am new to /r/personalfinance, so be easy on me. 

I graduated with my bachelors degree last May. I worked seasonally over the last year, and I am beginning graduate school in the fall. The tuition for my masters program is waived, and the program offers a stipend that covers living expenses (rent, utilities, etc.) However, the stipend for the program doesn't begin until the middle of September.

My roommate and I are moving to town around the first of August. The apartment that we will be living in will be a non-issue once my stipend kicks in. Until then, I am concerned about coming up with approximately two grand for the first month's rent, security deposit, utilities, etc. 

I am currently working part time at a fast food restaurant to make student loan payments and pay my current rent, so saving two grand by August is not exactly an option. I have a credit card, and could max it out with a cash advance , however the interest rate would be insane. My family isn't exactly rich, so taking a loan from them is not possible.

My question is: 

Do any of you have any experience with small private loans that may be helpful? 

What companies, etc. may be best to borrow from?

Anything specific that I should avoid when looking for a lender?

Ideally, I am looking for a loan of around 2-3 grand that I could preferably pay off quickly over a year or two.",finance,1433719972

personalfinance,Preparing to be first time homebuyers in 1.5-2 years- need some advice and input on our situation and what we can do,"Background- my fiance and I (married in 2 weeks) will be moving out of state and therefore having to buy a home for the first time, for a new job for him. It will be in the same career field he is currently in (law enforcement). We currently rent a home from my parents. Here are the numbers:

Income (gross)

him- $60k/year
me- 23k/year


Debt:
Debt consolidation loan- $19k, $601/month payment, 7.25 interest rate

Truck loan- $15k balance, $468/month payment, 3.5 interest rate

Jeep- $39k balance, 578/month payment, 3.15 interest rate

My student loans- 32k balance, interest rate unknown, income based repayment


Credit scores- both of ours are around 700. No bad marks on either credit.


The new job would be in Washington state and the same income he has now. It would be in the same career field he has been in for 10+ years, we just wouldn't know where in Washington state we would be living until we are further down the hiring process. I am currently preparing to do income taxes under my dad's business, my income would likely be left at 0 for this as I would be leaving my job here and doing the taxes full time and we don't know what my income would be then. 

We have a horse trailer that is for sale, the proceeds from that (5k) we are thinking of applying to the loan with the lowest balance, the truck loan. Same with our tax refund. He currently brings in 500-1000/month in overtime, we plan on using as much of that as possible for paying down our debt to prepare to get a mortgage. We would like to have a down payment, but with focusing on debt paydown to get a better debt to income ratio, we aren't sure how much would be left for down payment savings.

Is it feasible to expect to have the truck loan and debt consolidation loan paid off in that time for extra payments? Once he leaves his current job he will have about $4k in sick time they will have to pay out to him as well as about 8k in deferred comp which we plan to use to pay off remaining debt before we go house shopping. He also has a sizeable retirement built up (don't know how much it is at the moment), and we have thought of cashing that out for paying off whatever is left of the debt consolidation loan, or using it for down payment/closing costs, but aren't sure if the tax penalties on that would be worth it. In addition he will be selling his snowmobile as we will not have use for it, and expect we would get about $5k from that to apply to debt as well. If we do that, what kind of a mortgage can we realistically expect to be able to get? Are there any special programs for law enforcement? What else can we start doing now to improve our situation when it comes time to start the mortgage process?


Edit- I truly appreciate the advice. I have asked my fiance to consider selling his truck this year, even if we just break even on it (it is a few years old with 90k miles) to eliminate that almost $500/month, and asked him to consider selling his snowmobile this year as well, since he only had time to ride a couple times last year, it isn't something we can do together, and we would be selling it when we move in a couple years anyway, and the proceeds from it with selling his truck would be a GREAT jumpstart to get our debt and financial situation under control.",finance,1433728139

personalfinance,I guess I need someone to tell me where I'm going wrong in my thought process of paying off debt vs investing.,"So I guess I just need an outsiders opinion on this:

I have about $120,000 in debt from school.  It'd be cheaper as best I can tell to wait the 20 years and have it forgiven, making minimal IBR payments and then the tax hit at the end of 20 years, than to pay the full $120,000 + interest accrued during that time.  This of course hinges entirely on that whole policy not being revoked during those 20 years.  

However, I'm stuck on the thought that my paying off the debt at 6% interest rate is the same as investing and earning a 6% interest rate.  I feel this is somehow a flawed thought process.  

The interest still compounds in either scenario (paying off the debt vs investing it) if invested in like, a bank account or something (that's not going to happen though).  The only difference I can see is if I invest in stocks, they *might* split or I *might* get a pittance of a dividend back at some point, but essentially my stock selection would have to outperform a 6% interest rate over the same period of time to be better than me paying off the loans and no longer having to make monthly payments.  

I feel this is somehow inherently wrong, but don't know enough about it to find out where my logic is flawed, so I'd like someone to point it out for me.  

It boils down to basically:  
*  $120k in debt  
*  Can pay off ~$2,000 per month if need be (maybe $1,500 more realistically)   
*  Torn between paying the full $1,500 over a few years or the IBR minimum rate and investing the difference.

Mortgage: 108k left of 115k mortgage. 30 year term, 3.25% interest rate with pmi

Student loans:

My thinking is this: put all extra money towards current mortgage because we will save money in the long run with less interest plus the equity will be there for our down payment in the future.

    I take off again and as luck would have it, this new way seems much safer. I am making good progress without much encounters with any wildlife. I find myself climbing a ridge of this huge mountain. I reach the peak and the view is just magnificent. I think to myself ""What a nice place to sit with a picnic basket and have lunch or something.""

    As luck would have it, that is when I spy the picnic basket. Ha, someone already thought of the same thing. I take a closer look at the basket and written on it is ""Event 2 Prize 2"". It belonged to some tour or park guide from long ago I suppose. I peek into it to find an odd mixture of items. Some bones from a bear, an axe, a knife, some blueprints and $7000! I do not have much use for money these days but there was a time you would get killed for carrying around that much cash. I do not know how long these items have been stashed here but if recently, I very well could get killed for snooping around. I quickly close the basket without taking anything and scurry on down the cliff to much safer territory. Ah, chickens! What luck!

    As luck would have it, while hunting I come upon a fort. This group of survivors according to a notice posted outside their fort are actually friends with the group of traders I was looking for earlier. They even had a list of current items these traders had along with the direction and approximate miles I needed to travel to find them. They are actually in the area I was looking for them before in, but now that I know for sure they are there somewhere, I will just go back and concentrate my search in that area alone.

    As luck would have it, I actually do find the traders this time. Their fort is a bit confusing and looks very disorganized. The enormous size of it just adds to it's complexity. Many parts of the structure are either falling apart or under construction. I actually make entry through uncompleted sections. I walk around shouting to alert anyone there of my presence but I am only answered by my own echoes. I enter area after area as the design and current state of constructions leaves them completely vulnerable. If I found my way in here can't a bear do the same? I am a bit disappointed after hearing all the hoopla about them. But I am not here to take pictures of their fort. I am here to purchase items.

    As luck would have it, I finally find their trading area but do not find any bows I thought they might have for sell. Turns out that no one in the area makes them yet. There are those who are working on developing them along with many other items. Once new items are developed by the research teams, the technology will be shared so that everyone may make them providing they have the parts, tools and skills. The trip is not a total bust as I do buy a waterskin. I just wish now I would have bought the other 2 as well.

    As luck would have it, as I continue hunting small game, I find yet another abandoned fort. It has already been broken into as all wagons are gone. Seems to be the only thing people want around here. The place is loaded with buckets, pales and baskets stuffed with all sorts of items. Of course the dead are here too. Oddly they approach me and come within striking distance. They glare at me as to let me know I am unwanted here. But then they turn and wonder off. I would love to just take all of the items here but there is just too much and I have too far to go with it. Plus I am here for other things. I do manage to find rags. I don't know why but I value thread. I never seem to have enough. So I quickly turn the rags into thread. I put them in my pouch and continue. Taking the rags seem to have angered the dead. 3 of them suddenly charge me and I barely escape with my life. I run down hill and find a huge boulder to rest on.

    After resting I continue hunting. I am in a fight with a hamster when the commotion attracts a coyote. The coyote chases me off and I decide just to call it a day and return to camp.

    It has been more than 24 hours since I came upon the basket on the mountain peak. Who knows how long that basket has been there? Most people who approached that mountain will come face to face with the steep front side. Being unable to climb it they would naturally avoid it. I just happened to approach it from the opposite direction, a direction few would be traveling from. It most likely will remain up there for a very long time if this guide has died and/or abandoned it. So I decide to retrace my steps and if I find it still there, finder's keeper rule will go into affect.

    As luck would have it, I reach the mountain top once again and the basket with it's belongings is still there. I leave a note for the owner letting then know that I have their items and if they want them back they can come looking for me and I will simply return their items.

    As luck would have it, no one has come looking for me nor replied to my note I regularly check on. Each day it looks more and more like these items are mine to keep.

    Not much work done on the camp this week. Lots of interruptions from a particular Pit Bull. I named her Estreya. She likes to play fetch. Like once an hour but all is good. I could chase her off if I really wanted to. But I give into her whining and in the end I think I still accomplish more with all the little breaks.",technology,1433773085

personalfinance,How much to put down on a low interest new car loan?,"After a trade in, I'm looking to have a remaining balance of about $22,000 on a new minivan purchase. The interest rate should be 0.9% for a 36 month loan, which is quite low.

So, I could afford to put a hefty amount down as a down payment, and I like having small monthly payments and will probably pay it off much sooner than the 36 month loan.

I'm wondering if it makes more sense to put the large sum down now, or put a smaller amount down, and just increase my monthly payment more. I guess if I go with the latter, I still have the money in my account incase I need it for some extreme emergency. However, I'd still have enough in my emergency fund even with the large downpayment, so I'd really just be looking at an oversized emergency fund then. My savings account interest rate is currently 0.75%, so that nearly offsets any interest I'd be paying on the loan (0.9%)",finance,1433775741

personalfinance,I just closed on a 3.125% 15-year FHA mortgage refi on my condo - FHA is great!,"My Dad died in 2011, but before that, he quit claimed his townhouse to the both of us as ""joint tenant with right of survivorship.""  This means that both people now own the house, and if one dies, the other automatically owns the house with no inheritance issues.

The problem is, his MORTGAGE wasn't in both our names - just the title.  So I had to refinance his loan into my name (it's considered a refi if you own the house, which I did).  Just some advice to anyone wanting to get great deals on a condo - if you find one that is FHA certified, you can get an FHA loan, which has lots of benefits:

- The interest rate I got was insane, and my credit score wasn't even that good (minimum 640 to qualify).

- The interest rate is fixed, not an ARM.  So when rates go up, I'm still at 3.125%

- If you've had a recent foreclosure, some banks will not approve conventional mortgages.  With FHA, you can qualify with a foreclosure at least 3 years in the past.

- The mortgage is transferable to anyone who qualifies - traditional mortgages are not.  If you have to sell in a hurry, this is a huge selling point (especially if rates go up).

- Down payments are far lower than traditional - since my condo was worth 3 times what I was refinancing, I didn't have to put down anything (I even pulled money out).

- Downside is that you have to add your property taxes to escrow (which people usually do anyway), and you have to pay PMI - but my PMI is $40/mo out of $1,050 payment.

So if you're looking for a condo, and you've had recent financial problems (maybe due to the recession) go to https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/condlook.cfm and look up whether your development is approved.  You won't regret it.",finance,1433781783

**Background**
I currently live in Michigan, but will be moving to California with my wife in August. I'll be pursuing my doctorate at a school in Los Angeles. They'll be paying my tuition, giving me good health/vision/dental insurance, and a $12k stipend. Upon finishing my master's degree this past year I've accumulated ~$40K in federal student loan debt., and will probably take on more during the course of my PhD program. I also recently bought a car with $160/mo. payments (my previous car would not have held up to the daily LA commutes


**Current Situation**
I need to know how the heck I am going to swing this cross country move on the funding I have. I'm flying out to LA in late June to go apartment hunting (flights paid for, still have to pay for a rental car, and a hotel for 4 nights). Other than that I think I can coast, and just need to buy gas, utilities, groceries (rent is paid 2 mo in advance at my current apartment so that's done now). 

I think I can survive the last couple of months in Michigan, and the trip out there on my $3200 in savings/gig income, but my classes don't start until late September, and with the rent prices out there I'm going to need income until I start getting my stipend/loan money from school.


**Possible Solutions**
I can't get a job in Michigan because no one will hire somebody that's just going to quit in ~6 weeks. I think the best I can do is start hitting the pavement for a menial job once I get out West. It looks like there are tons of opportunities, does anyone living in a big city think this is even a possibility, or something I can somewhat rely on (snagging a part time job in the first week or so living out there)? Barring this, how irresponsible would it be to live off my credit card for my first month out there, and pay off the balance once my stipend/student loans disperse (it'd probably be slightly over a month on the card, so I'd get charged interest one time)?

**TL;DR** Moving to Cali, will probably be broke once I get there the first week of August, with no income until late September. Is it realistic to think I can land a part time job starting my first week out there? If I can't get a job, is it horrible to live off of a credit card for a month and a half, then pay it off with my student loan.",finance,1433784867

From what I understand, I may be able to save more by using my 401k instead of not contributing and saving it after tax.

I'm looking for holes in these points (disregarding state taxes and some minor changes in limits and rates that might occur over the next two years).

* If I want have as much cash as possible, I could stop contributing to my 401k for 2 years (no match) and take in an additional $25,920 (extra 36,000 taxed at my rate of 28%)

personalfinance,Should I get a personal loan (11%APR) to pay off my $5k credit card debt (22.99%)? And should I just get a second job?,"I got a credit card last summer that had 0% to help me during the turbulent period I was in (finding somewhere to live and finding a career job). I managed to only rack up about $2k in debt before a couple catastrophes happened and I had to move a second time, and now I'm sitting on about $75 in my bank account and $5k in credit card debt. 

I just built my budget and I am totally fine, this last move nearly killed me, but I survived it and stayed above the red (well... sorta). I have about $200 a month to repay this debt after all other expenses and savings (200$ savings each month). 

So here's my dilemma. I have a really great credit union that can give me a loan to wipe this credit card out at about 11%APR. They're super friendly, and at $200 a month I could pay it off in about 2.5 years, or in 3 years at about $165 (giving me $35 more spending which would be nice... see below). With this credit card though I'm looking at 22.99% APR that kicks in starting next month, making my first interest accrual on July 9th. By my calculations, I'll have it paid off in 35 months by paying this $200. So basically, I can choose between getting an unsecured personal loan or just sticking with the credit card. One is $35 (per mo, around $1100 overall) cheaper than the other, but it seems like an ordeal - I hate ordeals, and the feasibility is not necessarily concrete. My credit score is 697 so I assume I'll get a solid interest rate (minimum for 3 years is 9.75, so I assume 11. I have a car loan through them that the min was 4 and I got 5.75 as comparison).

Finally, and my second question, is that should I get a second job? My budget is rather meager, but I give myself some spending money and enough to live. If I had a second job though I'd totally be set. I have weekends completely off, but I work 9 hour days during the week. So if I made min wage (let's say 8$) and worked 16 hours a week, I could take home around $400 more a month after taxes and pay this debt off super quickly (if I could throw $600 a month at it it'd be gone in less than a year). Is this unnecessary though?

Thanks Reddit!

edit: typo

EDIT2: /u/IrritablePanda suggested balance transfering to another 0%. I hate opening more credit cards though. The one I am looking at right now that mint suggests I apply for gives 15 months of 0% which gives me about a 2 year payback in the end (versus 3 years) which is huge. This seems to be the best option.

EDIT3: I was approved for that 15 month 0% apr but for a limit below the $5k. They said to call once I had the card to discuss raising it, they said it was based on my current income and my credit report which is sorta surprising me since my other cards have a much higher limit and my total utilization is only about 50%.",finance,1433796878

I am a student at a reletively cheap community college and have about a year left to go. I was awarded financial aid once again, but this time, for the first time, I was awarded $4825 total in Pell Grants (to be used for Fall 2015 AND Spring 2016). I have never gotten a Pell Grant so that threw me off, but is good news I guess. I am assuming it is because I am having a child in September, so I put that on the FAFSA form. In past years, I have gotten regular loans, about $3000 per year. This year, in addition to the Pell Grants, they awarded me more federal Loans in the amount of $4500. So total money I COULD accept is $9325. This is far more than I need, as school for the year full time is around 2k - 3k for everything. I already owe about $7500 in student loans (I was an idiot and always accepted the full amount for extra monies up front from each previous loan). So basically I have a 6.5k car loan, and about 2k in other debt (not including my student loans). My credit is whack, my APR on the car loan is something like 20%. I know my student loans will be around 4% when school is over. Should I accept the whole sum, and pay my car off, or just the grant amount and pay whats leftover towards my car loan or other debt? I currently live pretty well off, but like I said I have a baby on the way and am expecting my expenses to increase somewhat significantly. My car / CC payments total about $500 per month so it would be nice to take everything offered and pay off those loans, then pay the student loans back at a lower interest rate when the time comes.

personalfinance,"How to manage a high balance, high interest credit card.","Hello PF.
I'm currently having problem I'd like to see myself rid of very soon.
I obtained a credit care with Discover about a year and a half ago.
When I received it I was only 20 with barely any credit and it had a $2,000 limit to my surprise. I used it sparingly, and shortly after my limit was bumped up to $3,000 without an inquiry of my own. Not long after I had to go through some personal things involving somethings with my son and the balance on this particular card kept rising due to the inciting 0% APR for the first 14 months. I hit a high of nearly $2,750 on the card and have recently working it down to about $2,350 but it's after the 14 month period of freely borrowing money and they pretty high interest rate is really making it difficult to pay it down without throwing larger and larger portions of my already garnished paycheck at it. I see lots of advice about getting another card with a 0% APR for balance transfers which I know I could manage this time, but I'm reluctant to apply due to it's limit not actually being as high as my current balance. I'm not sure about if I'd be able to swing a personal loan for the amount either. I had a 1k loan through my local credit union a few months ago and am not too sure they'd give me one for much higher. Can anyone point me in the direction of not having to pay 2k in interest to pay off a 2.3k balance?",finance,1433806562

personalfinance,Sell vs. Rent Home - Young couple with lots of debt,"Hello r/PersonalFinance! Thank you for taking the time to read this post. My SO and I are moving out of state for work. The new city is slightly more expensive than our current city, however, I will be receiving a sizeable pay increase that covers the cost of living difference for both my SO and I. We are both 27 years old, and we have owned our home for a little over two years. Unfortunately, we bought when we were young and really attracted to the idea of settling down. We have since realized that we are not ready for a permanent commitment to one place, and plan to rent rather than buy in the future, at least until we pay off some debt! I'm looking for advice about whether to rent out our home or to sell it. Furthermore, if we sell our home, I would love suggestions on how we should allocate the profits.


If we sell our home, we should walk away with ~$35,000 in profits, after ~7% in various fees. If we rent our home, we could make ~$400 per month in profits. The home is updated, but the air conditioner, water heater, etc are old, so we may be looking at some major expenses in the next few years.


Between us, we have the following debt...

SO's Student Loans: ~$60k at 4% interest

My Student Loans: ~$40k at 6% interest

Credit Cards: ~$11k at 20% interest

Payoff amount on car #1: $8740 at 3.5% interest

Payoff amount on car #2: $15,745 at 4% interest

TOTAL: ~$135,500


Monthly Payments...

2 Car Payments: $700 monthly

Student Loan Payments: $1100

Apartment in new city: ~$1500

Parking: $150

Utilities in new city: $200

Cell Phone Bill: $110

Car Insurance: $120

Credit Card Payments: $250

Other: $100

TOTAL: $4100


Monthly Income...

SO's Take Home: $3400

My Take Home: $2600

TOTAL:  $6000


I personally find the idea of selling our house and using the profits to pay off our credit cards and both cars to be very appealing. I realize that the cars don't have the highest interest rates, but it would just be nice to free up an additional $950 monthly to put toward loans/savings. I suppose the smarter thing to do would be to put the money toward the credit cards and then to the highest interest loans? We have also discussed paying off the credit cards and keeping the remaining ~$24,000 in a savings account, CD, or similar as a safety net. 


Our families and realtor suggest keeping the house as a good investment, but I am concerned about the responsibilities and liabilities of being a landlord. 


We obviously have a ridiculous, stupid amount of debt from a lot of foolish decisions we made when we were younger (Oh sure, I'll just take some extra student loans to afford that volunteer project to Thailand this summer!... Yeah, I definitely need to get a master's degree right away, and I'm willing to pay full price for it!... Let's have a schmancy wedding!... Probably we should each have a $20,000 car to drive!... Let's buy a house!... Now we have a house, we should for sure put thousands of dollars on credit cards to furnish it and fix it up!). We realize that the amount of debt we have is a huge problem and plan to save as much as we can going forward to reduce our debt. Renting a smaller place will reduce our utility costs, maintenance costs, etc and really help us save. Being further away from family than we are now will actually help save us money, because while we will have to occasionally buy plane tickets home, we won't be dropping hundreds of dollars for every birthday, parent-oriented holiday, or party-worthy occasion. We did choose the 10 year repayment plan on all of our student loans, which is, in a good way, forcing us to pay those loans as quickly as possible, and we plan to start allocating additional money to paying the loans. Right now, we both put 6% of our pre-tax paycheck into retirement, with company matching at 50%, but we would also like to increase our retirement contributions as well.

personalfinance,Questions about my first budget...,"I wrote [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/38u4vz/got_a_great_new_job_where_i_should_be_making_a/) 2 days ago and am just AMAZED at the amazing help I received from /u/wecannotsee and others. I didn't realize there was some major stuff I was missing in my budget, so I did a lot of rework and would love some more critique.


**SALARY:**
I just started my new job and it's $10.75 an hour plus commission. I've never had a job that made commission before, but I hear from a lot of representatives that have been at my new job for a while that since we are in the sales department, it's virtually impossible *not* to make commission. I asked HR and even found out that the *average* dollar amount (paid biweekly) of each salesman is $500. BUT... I need to create my budget in the *worst case* scenario, so I'm pushing aside that extra possible $1,000 (or more, since it's uncapped!) commission and just creating my budget with my hourly salary. 
$10.75 an hour x 80 hours = $1,720 - taxes + benefits = $1,346 a month.


**BILLS**

$560 - Rent

$405 - $500 - Transportation (this includes gas, insurance, and possible maintenance...)

$110 - Food ($40 a check on food for me, $30 a month for things for my cat...)

$50 - Utilities (this is just a guess, haven't started receiving utility bills at my new place yet...)

$75 - Phone (considering calling and canceling my $10 a month extra insurance, bringing it to $65 a month)

$30 - Internet


**SUMMARY:**
So, all in all, I'm looking at $1,220 (with cheap (car) insurance, not driving much, and getting rid of my phone insurance...) ranging up to $1,325 (if I'm not able to get cheap (car) insurance, keeping my phone insurance, having to drive more often, etc...). The difference between these two results is $105. **This, plus any commission I make, will be my firepower against my debt:


**DEBT:**

*Credit Card 1:* I owe a total of $5,611 with an interest rate of 14.99%. I am *so far* behind on payments that they have already sent it to the credit bureaus... and I don't think they can lower payments any (calling tomorrow to confirm), but right now I owe $324. I don't think that's the minimum monthly payment, it's just how much I owe at the moment. Should I not worry about this card for now, or make very small payments on it, since I can take care of Credit Card 2 faster (and because CC2 has a higher interest)?

*Credit Card 2:* I owe a total of $1,183 with an interest rate of 22.99%. I am *way* behind on payments, and actually owed $224.87, but I called them today and they worked with me! They were going to throw it to the credit bureaus at the end of the month, but they said if I paid them $58 this Friday, then $41 on the 4th of next month and the one after, I can just pay $35 a month after that until it's paid off!

*Hospital Bill:* Went to the emergency room a few months ago and ended up with a bill of $647.85, with monthly payments of $58.99 (that I am two months behind on).


And then, finally, what do I do about all the *little things* that I need? For example, this budget isn't even including shrink bills that I owe (around $500), or shrink visits (once every 3-4 months, which I'm considering stopping to save money). It doesn't have my $30 toll bill that I am way late on, or the cost of a baking pan that I need (along with aluminum foil) for cheaper foods. And most importantly, should I completely say *fuck it* to having any savings, and getting current before making my emergency fund, or would it be okay to set aside just $25 a check into my savings while trying to get current? What about money for haircuts, and entertainment, should I set aside a portion for that, too? And for the first three months, my internet will be $66 because I'm paying for the router (saving me money in the long run). I quit smoking cigarettes already, and am *NOT* smoking ever again, putting an extra $175 in my pocket a month! I am eating nothing but rice with Sriracha sauce and PBJs after my boxed dinners go away. I want to get hardcore about my debt, I want to stop feeling so damn stressed all the time about money. 


**Thanks for any help, seriously, you guys are quite literally saving my life.** And keep in mind, $1,346 is the *minimum* I'll be making. I'll also be making anywhere from $250 (if I sell less than average) to $1,000 (average) to even more, possibly, a month.",finance,1433815995
personalfinance,Used Car Purchase - Did I get screwed in the end,"tl/dr - Worked the dealership. Got the deal I wanted. Bought a car. Finance manager forced Gap insurance into the deal. Feel like I got screwed. Did I?

So, I've been doing a lot of research over the past year or so, finding the right car for my family, brushing up on negotiating tactics, knowing my credit, knowing my alternative options to financing, and finally went car shopping.

The whole process felt smooth.  I knew the dealer's tricks, fought back, and ultimately got what I wanted: A 2012 GMC Acadia, 38,000 miles for $21,500.  Talked the finance guy down by 2.25% interest, down to 4.29%, which I feel is reasonable based on where my credit is.  

Life is good. Go to the dealership. Looking over the paperwork. Price is what we talked. Interest rate, 4.29% check. Term, good. Minimal origination fee. Everything is good.

Oh wait, gap insurance. I didn't ask for gap insurance.

Finance manager informs me that it is a ""stipulation of the rate shave"" down to 4.29%.   Red flags are flying high. I'm calling BS. But, my wife's with me. As is our 2 year old. Who is far past dinner time and throwing a fit.  Yeah, I know, big time failure having the kid with me.  I had to rush it, and that bothers me.

Anyway, I'm skeptical.  But the finance guy runs the numbers. Sure, the gap premium is less than I'd pay in interest by not having the rate shave.  That's clear as day.  But, can they require it as a term of the loan?  

Now, I'm for gap insurance in general. Just, not from buying from a dealer. And not from being forced into it, when I think his premise is BS.  

Step away for a few, try to google something. Damnit, I know, we need to wrap this up. You're hungry, the kid's hungry. I get it.  Screw it, fine, let's get this done.  I take the deal.

So, now for all of you that know, can a finance company require the purchase of gap insurance as a stipulation of the terms of their loan, or did I get conned at the last step and get talked out of $800 I wasn't required to spend for the deal?  

If it's crap, and they can't require it, should I go back to my sales person, let her know that she was awesome and had a repeat customer, until her finance guy lied to me? Or, should I just suck it up and try not to let that shiny new car in my driveway irritate me for getting played.",finance,1433817850

School Debt (federal loans): ~ $288,000  + (~$20K accrued interest that is about to capitalize now that school is done). FUN.
Current Roth IRA total:  ~$3300

My question is, after expenses (rent, food etc). Should I use my money to max out my Roth each of the next 3 years or should I use all extra cash to pay down by loans (most are ~6.8%) and ignore my Roth/retirement at this point (no 401k matching either)??

Im at a loss as I hate my loans/interest rate, but also Im concerned with being 29yo and such meager retirement investments up until now. 

Also if it matters, since $114,000 is max (single) income qualification for a Roth, I am assuming I will no longer be able to contribute to my Roth after the next 3 years, as my income will then jump above that threshold.

personalfinance,"Let's Talk Life Insurance: Explanations of Whole Life, Term Life and Universal Life","I am a former life insurance agent that drank the Kool-Aid and sold Universal Life for 2.5 years before I realized this is not really the ideal plan for 99% of my clients. For more reference, I was a captive agent for a mid-sized life and health insurance company. A Universal Life Policy would pay me 55% commission of the first years target premium and 5% annually after that of all premium collected.

Let's start with the types of life insurance out there.

### Term Life  
### Whole Life  
### Universal Life  
___________________________

**Term Life**  
This is temporary insurance that provides a death benefit to your named beneficiary in the event of your death while the policy is in force. It is offered in several forms, and despite a common misconception in /r/personalfinance, a 20 year or 30 year term is usually not the best/cheapest option.

**Level Term Life Insurance**: Offered in 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 year options most typically. Your premium remains the same during this period of time. Some policies are renewable meaning that you can extend the term once it's finished, however, this will be at a much higher premium as you are essentially buying life insurance at a later age (20 years down the road for example, and insurance on a 50 year old is significantly more costly than on a 30 year old). The advantage of a renewable policy, is that if your health deteriorates later on, but you still need insurance, you won't have to go through a medical exam/underwriting/approval process.

**Annually Renewable Term Insurance**: Annually renewable term is the least expensive insurance available on the market. This is offered as a renewable life insurance policy, guaranteed renewable for a fixed amount of time, frequently until 65 years old. Your rate will increase every year. The advantage to this, while your insurance will unfortunately become more expensive later in life, that is typically when you have more affordability for it, as well as potentially not needing it. With a level policy, you pay more up front to keep the payment the same, with annually renewable (ART) you don't have to do that. If you pass away young, ART was the best bet. If you survive the life of the policy and cancel when you no longer need it, it still will have cost you less money than a level term kept for the same amount of time.
___________________________

**Whole Life**  
This is a permanent insurance contract. It is designed to be there for your whole life. It is a cash value bearing policy, meaning there is a type of savings account attached to the policy. The ""savings account"" accumulates cash at predetermined amounts, more later on in the policy. Depending on the company (stock or mutual) will determine if you earn dividends. Stock companies are publicly or privately traded and do not pay dividends. Mutual companies offer dividends. Dividends are not guaranteed. They are a refund of company profit split among the companies policyholders on an annual basis.

What can you do with your dividends? They can be used to pay a portion of, or your whole premium. They can be taken in cash. They can be re-invested so that you earn dividends on your dividends.

You have an option to take loans from this policy. The insurance company will charge you an interest rate, but that will allow you to access some of the cash value.

When you pass away, assuming the policy is still in force, you will be paid the Face Amount (death benefit) of the policy, less any loans taken and accumulated interest on those loans.

___________________________

**Universal Life**

First, let's talk about what's common to all types of Universal Life Insurance.

Like other life insurance contracts, you make a monthly or annual premium payment.

Step 1.) With a Universal Life policy, the first thing that happens with this money is a load fee is charged. Most companies, this is around 5% but it can vary, I've seen as high as 8% and as low as 3.75%. This is money taken right off the top of all contributions going into the pocket of the insurance company. (Note: Not all companies charge their load fee on the front end, not going to go into back end load fees here though).

Step 2.) Next, your remaining premium contributions goes into your cash value bucket or savings/investment account. This account accumulates interest, tax deferred.

Step 3.) The insurance company deducts the cost of insurance from your cash value. This is Annually Renewable Term Insurance (if you recall from the above, this is the least expensive type of insurance). In this deduction is included a monthly administrative fee which varies from one company from another but can be as much as 50% of the monthly contribution amount. Most companys waive administration fees after 10-15 years the policy has been in force.

Step 4.) Left over funds remain in your cash value accumulating interest.

The premise behind this policy is that eventually, as the cost of insurance increases, you will have contributed enough excess funds that are now earning enough interest to offset the cost of the increasing insurance costs.

Universal Life comes with a lot of options, including, flexible premium contributions, flexible death benefits, and more flexible access to your cash value.

It also comes with two types of death benefit options.

**Death Benefit Option A:** Level Death Benefit: When you pass away, the company will pay your beneficiaries, the face amount (death benefit) of the policy, but not any of the cash value. There is an exception to this where the cash value increases beyond the face amount, which due to an insurance corridor (not going into detail here) increases the death benefit.

**Death Benefit Option B:** Increasing Death Benefit: When you pass away, the company will pay your beneficiaries, the face amount (death benefit) of the policy as well as any accumulated cash value.

With an increasing policy, you are always paying for the same amount of insurance, IE $250,000 as annually renewable term. With Option A, you are only paying for the difference between the face amount and the cash value. IE You have a 250k Option A policy with $100,000 in cash, you are paying insurance costs for $150,000 at this point.

___________________________

Next, let's talk about the 3 main types of universal life insurance.  
1.) Fixed Universal Life  
2.) Equity Indexed Universal Life  
3.) Variable Universal Life  

**1.) Fixed Universal Life:** The insurance company offers a minimum guaranteed interest rate, most companies are currently offering 3%. Some older policies offered as high as 10% guaranteed interest. This is the interest that your cash value is earning on an annual basis. In addition to the minimum amount of guaranteed interest, the insurance company also pays 'excess interest'. This amount is determined by current bond interest rates, the companies experience (loss due to claims) as well as any other factors they deem necessary. Most companies are currently offering 1-2.5% excess interest for a total return of 4-5.5% annually in June 2015.

**2.) Equity Indexed Universal Life:** Most companies include 3 ""buckets"" or allocation options for this policy. The first and foremost is the fixed bucket, same as above, but usually a lower minimum and higher excess rate.  
The next bucket allocation is what's known as a **month to month averaging**. After telling you this is participating in the stock market (S&amp;P500), but with zero risk of loss the best way to explain it is via the chart below. This bucket is usually limited by a participation rate which can vary from one company to another. Most companies I've seen are currently offering 80-100% participation and offer a 10% guaranteed minimum participation.

Month | Year 1 | Year 2
------|--------|--------
Jan | 1000 | 1100
Feb | 1050 | 1050
Mar | 1100 | 1075
Apr | 1150 | 1075
May | 1200 | 1050
Jun | 1250 | 1025
Jul | 1300 | 1000
Aug | 1350 | 1000
Sep | 1375 | 975
Oct | 1400 | 950
Nov | 1250 | 950
Dec | 1100 | 950
Total | 14525 | 12200
Average | 1210 | 1016
Difference | +210 | -84

As you can see, the finishing average in the first year of the policy was 210 points above the start. This equates to a 21% net return (210/1000). These earnings are locked in. The new starting point for year 2 is the ending point for year 1 which is 1100.

In year 2, there was a net loss of 84 points, you might think this equates to a loss of (84/1100), however, the purpose of equity indexing is that there is a guaranteed zero loss principle and sometimes even a 1% guarantee. This year you would have net 0 or 1% despite the market finishing down 150 points from it's start. The starting point for year 3 is 950.

This is the true value of the investment portion of equity indexed universal life, but once again, remember, the participation rate we assumed above is 100%. This is up to the insurance company. While the agent may present you with a 100% participation rate illustration, I promise, it will decrease over time.

Last bucket is **Annual Point to Point**: Using the above example, You start the year @ 1000 and end @ 1100, you earned 10%. Year 2, you start the year @ 1100 and end @ 950, you lost 150 points but netted 0 due to guarantees. This is subject to a cap rate which varies between 8% and 15% from different companies. This is the most the insurance company will allow you to earn in a positive market year. This is subject to increase or decrease just like the interest rates and participation rate.

**3.) Variable Universal Life:** This is the same as the previous policies, however, this is typically invested in mutual funds or the like. This requires that you are a licensed financial advisor to sell, which I am not, so I will leave it here. All I will say, the policies I've usually seen are invested in high expense mutual funds, a bad year can really mess up your cash value planning for the future.

**Accessing your Money in a Universal Life Policy**  
You can access your money via a combination of both withdrawals (up to the amount you've contributed) tax free as long as the policy stays in force. You can also take loans from the policy, which are also tax free, but the interest reduces your cash value. The amount of cash you have access to is your 'Net Surrender Value'. During the first 10-20 years of the policy, unless you are putting as much as the IRS allows you to for the amount of insurance you have (see illustration below) this will be a fairly minimal amount. Don't expect to be able to withdraw as much as you've put in during the first 20 years. Do not treat this as a cash/savings account, this money should not be considered liquid for 15-20 years as that will have a dramatic impact on future growth which is needed offset increased insurance costs.

I could go into tons more details but it's really not worth it. If there are questions though, I will respond.

I will share one cool example of Equity Indexed Universal Life. This is a policy taken out on a 30 year old male, non-smoker, with a standard rating. **IF**, and that's a big if, participation rates and cap rates stayed @ 100% and 10% respectively, the assumed columns (right side) show prospective future growth based on $5500 contributions annually from age 30 until 59. The money in this illustration is allocated 20/40/40, 20% fixed, 40% monthly averaging, 40% point to point. The guaranteed column is basically a financial Armageddon scenario in which the market collapses every year and you never earn more than 1 interest. It also assumes the company charges the highest legal rates for insurance and associated fees. This assumes no money is ever taken out from the policy, but you can start to see the interest accumulation at work. For someone over the income limit that can't contribute to a ROTH IRA and would like to leave a tax free legacy for their children...this works out to a reasonable rate of return **(SPEAK TO A FEE ONLY CFP acting as a fiduciary,  BEFORE AN INSURANCE AGENT, I can't emphasize this enough)**. This example is based on the last 25 years of performance of the S&amp;P500, takes into account cost of insurance, load fees and administrative and any other sorts of fees.

[Mini Illustration](http://imgur.com/heD8F1t) &gt; $159,500 turns into just over $2,000,000 tax free. Once again, this is how it's sold, not how it'll actually happen...

personalfinance,Should I continue to overpay on my mortgage?,"All -

When I purchased my first home 2.5 years ago (Nov. 2013) I was adamant I wanted to pay it off as soon as possible. I am now questioning if this is the smartest decision financially since my interest rate is so low and I could most likely do better with other investment vehicles. 

Information about my loan:  
- 176,641 (original loan amount)  
- bi-monthly payments  
- 3.125% interest rate 
- Total monthly payment due (w/ escrow) $1,306 (including $171 mortgage insurance) 
- I pay $750 on the 1st &amp; 15th of the month with the rest going to principal.  
- FHA loan - so I need to pay mortgage insurance for minimum of 5 years AND need 21% of my original loan paid off. ($139,546) 

I'd like some input on what you all think the best financial decision is for me and my wife. As I see it, there are a few options;

Option #1 - Continue my current plan, pay off the loan in approx 20 years   
Option #2 - Pay the minimum on my mortgage and take the extra $200/month to invest in ROTH IRA (i currently do not have one but am doing 20% (15k/year) in ROTH 401k.)     
Option #3 - Continue my current plan until I meet the requirements for my mortgage insurance to be removed, then dial back my principal payments.",finance,1433855086
personalfinance,Financing Help with Used Car Purchase,"Ontarian here. Making about 50k/year (1500 biweekly after tax) about 2 years out of school and have about 66k in debt on a student LOC (prime + 0.5%, 3.35% currently i believe). 

I have been making due since graduation with my parents' old 1999 Passat but its starting to enter the period where its costing more to keep this thing going than it is likely worth. I think it will last me fine for the next 4-5 months, but I am hesitant to go through another Canadian winter with this car. 

Pursuant to my loan agreement, the LOC becomes a fixed loan at the same interest rate in mid July, so I only have access to the funds until that time (it maxes out at like 90k if I wanted). The payments will be around $600-700/month at the current balance and I have been presently been putting about $1000/month to the LOC even though no payments are owing. I have around 3k in the bank currently. 

Under the circumstances, I am trying to decide the following:

1) How much should I spend on a used car considering my debt? I would ideally like something to last 4-5 years at which point I would like to believe I would be in a financial position to upgrade. 

2) Should I take money out of my LOC before it expires for the purposes of purchasing the used car or finance through a dealership (I imagine the former makes more sense)? Should I just use savings, maybe save up to 5kish?

3) In the event that I cannot find a suitable car in advance of the LOC conversion to a loan, does it make sense to just take out 5-10k to have for once I do find a suitable car or for some other reason? 

4) Should I continue to make the 1k payments once the monthly payments become mandatory, if it remains financially doable, or wait to building some savings? 

Another note: I am planning on booking a one week trip to Europe in October and expect to conservatively incur about $2500 all in. I know I know but its happening haha.

So here's my situation.

I'm looking to speed up the repayments and get my life finally going on my own. I know increasing the income stream is a must, whether it be through a 2nd job or ditching working for my father altogether for a better paying job. My only regular expenses are gas and a monthly cell phone bill. I already am throwing all my extra income towards the private loans since they have the highest interest rate. Mint has me projected at my current pace to be free from the debt around January 2021.

Details inside.,"I'm 27/M, married with no children making 40K a year and my wife makes about about 18k only working 8 months out the of year, she does not work during the Summer but does work part time at our church and does dance camps in June and July. We had $1600 in savings but with a recent storm in our area, a dead tree started to lean heavily over our house which had to be cut down and removed immediately. We are having trouble controlling our CC debt due to unforeseen circumstances and we don't have any type of savings left.
My breakdown are as follows:

My take home pay is $1128 after taxes and health insurance bi-weekly

- Mortgage = $800 a month @ 3.75, I pay $400 on the 1st and another $400 on the 15th
- Car Payment - $263 @ 1.6% interest. We have 2 cars and the other one is paid off
- Car Insurance - $175
- Cell Phone bill - $120
- Cable/internet - $145
- Gym Membership - $70 - This helps with coping with the stress of my job being in IT
- Groceries $100-150 Bi-weekly, we eat out twice a month, but not at expensive place
- Electric bill - $150 - Higher in the Summer of course with the AC running. I do my best to conserve, by turning off all of the lights, setting the thermostat at 78 when I leave
- Gas Bill - $40
- Water Bill - $60

- I owe a combined total of $8900 on 4 different cards at very high interest rates
- $3900 on a BoA Platinum @ 15% APR, min payment is $85
- $2200 on a Discover IT @ 21% APR, Min payment is $65
- $1300 on a BoA Rewards @ 15 % APR, min payment is $45
- $985 on a Lowes card - Min payment is $30
- $140 on an Amazon card- min payment is $25
- $240 payment plan for our vet - min payment is $40

So about $300 a month, I'm paying towards Debt, which is a chunk of change and will take a while to pay off.

Altogether, I'm at about $8500 owed in CC debt. I've looked at loans through Propser and they have one for 10k @ 218.17 for 60 months @ 13.41% APR

Or I could do a balance transfer to a card that has 0%APR for 18 months.

Here is the kicker: When I turn 30, I will be receiving a settlement annuity pay out of 250K tax free from an injury when I was younger.

As stated I'm a college student (Went to a 2 yr tech school right out of High School, worked at seasonal job for 4 summers (with pt schooling), now returned to University full time to finish remaining 2 years (one left as of this spring). I have a car loan ($9000 remaining balance) &amp; 20K of school loans (one more year's worth to come).

I have many questions, but I'll start with the most basic first:

I am absolutely feeling weighed down by these loans. The car loan itself is $300 per month and will take me about 3 more years to pay off (7.21% interest rate). How do I manage this and upcoming school payments next year? 

I have typically only been making $14/hour at most. I have 4 years of management experience under my belt, but I have struggled to find anything that pays better. My area of study is Horticulture/forestry (I want to work in either forestry or extension) .

Is there a trusty place  I can go to find out my credit score? 

This thread was spurred by having my debit card info stolen and am currently in the process of having claims disputed for charges on my damn checking account. Where can I find a good credit card that has low interest/low annual fee that can be trusty for online purchases and daily use? Also... what are assets?

I apologize for the many questions spilled out across this post.

personalfinance,Should We Buy A House?,"My wife and I have been in our current house for 3 years now and we are about to start a family.  The house is kind of small and we definitely are wanting to move, but don't know if it's a good idea at this point.

The house I'm wanting to get will be in the range of $275,000 - $350,000.  My current salary is $52,000 before taxes (just recently got promoted and will be looking at a raise in the next 6 months if I perform how I should be).  My wife works part time and brings in around $26,000 a year before taxes (give that she works a conservative weekly amount since she doesn't always work the same amount of days every week).

My credit score is in the EXCELLENT range on every scale.  High 700's. 

We have been paying off our mortgage just a little higher than our minimum principal every month since we moved in (June 2012).  We are currently at $85,000 left of the $104,000 amount (ESCROW).  I have a nice little stock nest egg of about $35,000 we could put on down payment.

The house we have our eye on is $390,000 but it has been on the market for quite a few months now and I think we might be able to talk down to $350,000.  

If we can manage that, put the $35,000 of our stock nest (this is not IRA or any retirement account, just some stock I was lucky enough to grow and sustain), sell our current house for about $140,000 (conservative amount - current interest rate is 4.25%), it would give us about $90,000 for a down payment.  So it would bring our total loan amount to $260,000.

With my excellent credit score, do you think we could get an interest rate of around 3.5%, or would it be closer to 3.92% (which is current average I suppose)?  We would be going for a 15 year fixed.  Do you think it is fiscally responsible for us to get in to this sort of thing right now, or should we wait a couple years to bring down our current mortgage before we were to sell?

Edit: Please note, I am not saying we would break into our retirement or Emergency funds (EF is about ~$36,000).  The stocks I'm referring to were just a random investment years ago that paid off and have little growth now after it's boom.",finance,1433864274

Due to downsizing I've recently lost my job of 9 years resulting in a 60K annual pay cut for our household. I've been looking for 4 months but have yet to find something new. 
I've currently got about 22K in cc debt, behind at least a month on all the payments with interest rates ranging from 8 all the way up to 19%.  (I know, I'm and idiot).  I've also got some medical bills from having a baby last year, approx 8K after my insurance paid its share. 
I've consulted a BK attorney and would qualify for Chapter 13 if I choose to do so. My understanding is that going this route will require me to repay the unsecured debt at 0% over 5 years, my car will go away but I can keep my home. The attorney also said that the medical bills would probably just go away because they would ""not participate"" since they've gotten most of their money from insurance. 

I've recently started getting a bunch of stuff in the mail from mystery companies (there's no real names on the letters just loan offers and phone numbers) offering to help reduced the debt and repay at a reduced rate, most say approx 4 - 6%.  I've not yet contacted any of them. 

I have some savings available and could potentially pay off a large majority of the cc debt IF I were able to settle with them for a lower dollar amount.

I guess I'm just looking for advice. Im pretty sure I'll still have to file for BK because of the car and medical bills but if I could get rid of a lot of that cc debt on my own, before filing, it would lower the amount I have to pay back over the 5 years.  
Are these letters legit? Should I call and try to take advantage of them, or can I just call and try to settle with the cc companies myself?  Is there something in particular I should say or do to get a better settlement?

Bitcoin,A simple way to think about how sidechains work,"A simple way to think about sidechains, is to start off thinking about an off-chain web-wallet like Coinbase or ChangeTip. The service has a Bitcoin address with which it can receive and send actual bitcoin on the blockchain, and the private key is under private, centralized control.

You send some bitcoin in, and the service credits your account with its own ""Magic ChangeTip Money."" Then you and other ChangeTip users can do whatever you want with your new credits, as long as the service allows it. Those internal transactions can be signed with Schnorr signatures, Lamport signatures, Ring signatures, whatever... The transactions can be smart contracts, smart property, smart whatever. ChangeTip can even start inflating its own money supply if it likes, diluting the value of everyone's holdings.

Then whenever you want some of your bitcoins back, you request a withdrawal from the service. Based on how many Magic ChangeTip Money coins you have, the internal rules of their service, inflation or whatever they do to your Magic ChangeTip Money coins, the service updates its own ledger (deleting your Magic ChangeTip Money coins) and sends an actual Bitcoin transaction to your withdrawal address on the actual Bitcoin blockchain.

So like ChangeTip and Coinbase, Blockstream Elements (alpha) can never send more bitcoins than it has ever received. It can use any Bitcoin transaction output it controls to send any amount of bitcoin it owns back to the Bitcoin blockchain. Meanwhile on its own ledger, anything can happen. Also like ChangeTip and Coinbase, there is a risk that at any moment, Elements-alpha vanishes and everyone's money is gone, because none of the users ever held a private key to any actual bitcoins.

The differences between Coinbase/ChangeTip and Elements alpha are exciting and very compelling: Elements alpha is based completely around a 5-of-7 multisig address. The seven keys are distributed on seven servers all running the Elements network. They are the only nodes that are ever allowed to ""mine blocks,"" and through that 5-of-7 multisig, they control the actual Bitcoin value. Meanwhile, the sidechain they mine is incredibly cool. There's tons of new features that implement smart contracts, smart property, cryptographic privacy improvements, and different signature types that offer flexible multisig policies and tons of other improvements over Bitcoin. Genius-level stuff here.

Just like any other blockchain, every transaction on the sidechain is audited for validity and all the miners' work is audited by all the peers on the sidechain, just like any good decentralized system. However, if you have a dispute or detect misbehavior, there is nothing you can do, because the seven servers are lord of the sidechain.

So to use the Elements network features, you send some bitcoin to the Elements multisig address, then head on over to the Elements network and claim it. You do whatever you want with it on Elements then, whenever you're done, you request that the Elements miners send you some bitcoin back in ""the real world.""

This is all mind-boggling awesome, but it relies on trusting that federation of servers. So the next step is to actually soft-fork Bitcoin to allow decentralized side chains. Everything will still work the same way, except the seven privately controlled centralized servers will be replaced by ""anybody"" mining the sidechain according to the sidechain's rules. When bitcoins are sent from the sidechain back into Bitcoin, those miners will have to prove to the Bitcoin network that they have enough money in their account, they own some specific coins, and they want them to move on the blockchain (just like any other single user with a Bitcoin wallet).

Now that ""proving to the bitcoin network"" part is the real crazy magic. That's the key that allows sidechains to work in harmony with Bitcoin and stay decentralized and secure at the same time. It will work like an SPV wallet. An SPV wallet doesn't need to know the entire blockchain, just the block headers (imagine inserting an entire sidechain blockchain into a single bitcoin transaction, just to prove you own enough sidechain coins to withdraw them back into bitcoin!). In fact, the proposal (in Appendix B of the sidechains whitepaper) describes an SPV proof that is compact and practical for including in a bitcoin scriptSig. Not only does it not need to include the entire blockchain, it doesn't even need to include all the block *headers* -- it can skip over most of them, proving blockchain consistency and transaction depth without taking up too much space.

So, sidechains are not alt-coins. They are systems that allow you to add special features, bells and whistles, to the Bitcoin you already have. There is no trading sidecoins, there is no market price discovery or speculation. If you want some sidecoins, you just convert your bitcoin directly into sidecoin without anyone's permission, for the cost of a regular miner's transaction fee. That is, if the sidechain's rules allow you do that.

personalfinance,How to prioritize loan payments when anticipating moderate amounts of more debt in the near future.,"Right now I'm making $50k/year at 24 years old as an entry level engineer. I have about $25k in student loans with interest rates ranging from 3-6.8%. I'm currently tackling them using the snowball method suggested in the sidebar. Minimum payments are $140 but I'm putting $300/month towards them at the moment. So I don't have any real issues making payments on them. No CC debt, no mortgage, no car payment. Just the essentials like food, rent, utilities, and gas. $2k in savings that I've accumulated only since starting my current job about 3 months ago. Currently putting 10% of my income into it monthly with sporadic larger payments when I feel like it. 4% of my income also goes into a 401k that my company matches. This just started this month so there's basically nothing in it at the moment. 

I'm anticipating major dental work in next year or so that could cost upwards of tens of thousands of dollars depending on what exactly I get done and where I get it done. I'm still exploring options there. All the work would only take a few months so time isn't much of a factor, just cost. 

I am also toying with the idea of pursuing my Master's degree in Germany at some (likely within the next year or two). The program I'm interested in would cost about $16k for the whole 2 years in tuition. The cost of living in the city is about 800 euro/month. At the rate I'm currently saving, I'm confident I could have the $16k saved up to possibly pay the tuition up front. But I likely wouldn't have anything left over to live off of. Another option would be to put that money possibly towards the dental expenses I'm anticipating as the interest on those would likely be higher than the interest on any student loans I take out. Scholarships and grants are also another possibility but I don't have any hard numbers on those. 

If I wanted to have 16k saved by next year, I'd have to put 1300 away every month which is half of my monthly income. I could do it as that's what I was living off of at my last job but it would also mean considerably smaller payments on my exisiting loans. 

What I'm wondering is how exactly I should prioritize these potential debts from a financial perspective, if that makes any sense. Is lowering my payments on my existing student loan debt worth it if it means saving 50% of my income? Should I even attempt to pay the 16k in tuition out of pocket or just take out more loans? Another 16k doesn't seem like that much to me, honestly. I anticipate pretty good salaries from here on out. Especially for a single guy with no desire to own a house, car, get married, have kids, etc. any time soon.",finance,1433875311

I just graduated college and I am self employed. I don't have any expenses and plan to go to law school next year.

bigdata,"Integrating Spark, Kafka &amp; Hbase to Power a Real Time Dashboard","Industries are increasingly leveraging the advantage of Big data for analytics and making key decisions to optimize their existing businesses. Traditionally dashboards were updated by batch jobs and there has always been a lag of several minutes or sometimes hours between the arrival of data and before it can be displayed to the user. As a result key decisions were delayed and it often resulted in revenue loss.   But with emergence of Spark Streaming, it’s now possible to create Real Time Dashboards, at low costs and  sub second latencies. [Sigmoid’s SigView](http://ift.tt/1JUEVi6) is a real time analytics dashboard in build using spark which is capable of processing a million events per second and can be customized for any use case. In this blog i will share how we used Kafka and Hbase to implement SigView, the technical challenges faced and how we overcame them.

Technology – Overview

Achieving such high velocity data processing warranted creation of receivers that could process incoming records and storage that could store results at high velocity. For creating this dashboard we used Spark 1.2.1 for backend processing, Kafka for message passing, Hbase for storing data and D3.js for data visualization. Spark Streaming[link to introduction blog] allows users to process data in small batches. It can process up to 500K events per machine per second (depending on the event size). D3.js allows to visualize data using the latest web standards, hence is compatible with all major browsers.

Creating the framework**[](http://ift.tt/1QJisEz)**The diagram depicts the data flow in the SigView System. The data generated at the Source system reached Spark Cluster via [various sources](http://ift.tt/1FBA4jL). The Kafka messaging queue passes the logs on the Spark Streaming Component via a Spark Streaming Receiver. The processing logic is applied and the required metrics are calculated on the cluster.

Sometime, we would need to display the aggregated near real-time data to power our dashboards, for [stateful stream processing](http://ift.tt/18CQICy) its not possible. We can also push or update the aggregated data in an intermediate database (We used HBase here) from which our BI tools can directly fetch the data and power the dashboards accordingly.

[](http://ift.tt/1KnngQg)

We used 2 machines of n1.standard-4 on GCE with 4 cores and 15GB Memory on each for the implementation.

There are multiple ways to read messages from Kafka in Spark streaming, you can categorize them as receiver based approach and non-receiver based approach. ie:

  - [KafkaUtils.createStream](http://ift.tt/1QJisEF)(High-level receiver based kafka consumer)
  - [KafkaUtils.createDirectStream](http://ift.tt/1KnneI5)(Non-receiver based kafka consumer)
  - [ReceiverLauncher.launch](http://ift.tt/1QJivAd)(Low-level receiver based kafka consumer)

Now, lets see the configurations of these three to read messages at a higher throughput.

[KafkaUtils.createStream](http://ift.tt/1QJisEF)(High-level receiver based kafka consumer)

This one comes up with spark (spark-streaming-kafka\_2.10), and you can simply create a stream from kafka by:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;import org.apache.spark.streaming.kafka.\_
   
val kafkaStream = KafkaUtils.createStream(streamingContext,
   
[ZK quorum], [consumer group id], [per-topic number of Kafka partitions to consume])&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;To control the rate, we set the spark.streaming.receiver.maxRate which is the maximum rate (number of records per second) at which each receiver will receive data. Effectively, each stream will consume at most this number of records per second. Setting this configuration to 0 or a negative number will put no limit on the rate.

This won’t be the suitable choice if each of your message size varies from time to time.

[KafkaUtils.createDirectStream](http://ift.tt/1KnneI5)(Non-receiver based kafka consumer)

This one is a new non-receiver based kafka consumer which is added to the spark-streaming-kafka\_2.10 artifact from spark version 1.3.x. It is a bit tricky approach, Instead of using receivers to receive data, this approach periodically queries Kafka for the latest offsets in each topic+partition, and accordingly defines the offset ranges to process in each batch.

You can create a stream by:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;import org.apache.spark.streaming.kafka.\_
   
val directKafkaStream = KafkaUtils.createDirectStream[
   
[key class], [value class], [key decoder class], [value decoder class]]
   
(streamingContext, , [set of topics to consume])&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Here’s a few configuration options which play key role in this consumer’s behaviour:

  - spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition:Maximum rate (number of records per second) at which data will be read from each Kafka partition when using the new Kafka direct stream API. Up this value to have a higher consumption rate.

  - auto.offset.reset:Kafka parameter, which will decide at which point the consumer should receive messages. If set to “smallest” it will receive messages from the beginning, if set to “largest” it will receive the latest messages which are fed into kafka after the streaming job is started.

One important thing to note about this consumer is that it doesn’t commit it’s offset anywhere (unless checkpointed) so once you restart your driver program, it will either read from the beginning or from the latest one (depending on the offset reset), which means it will redo the whole processing again or it will lose some data which has arrived between the time your application crashed and restarted. The throughput of this consumer also depends on the # of messages, if your message size varies from time to time it won’t be a good choice.

[ReceiverLauncher.launch](http://ift.tt/1QJivAd)(Low-level receiver based kafka consumer)

This is a third [party package](http://ift.tt/1KnngQk) which make use of the Kafka low-level consumer API to receive messages from kafka, it is a receiver based approach.

You can create a stream by:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;import consumer.kafka.ReceiverLauncher
   
val lowlevelStream = ReceiverLauncher.launch
   
(ssc, props, numberOfReceivers,StorageLevel.MEMORY\_ONLY)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Here’s a bunch of configuration options which defines the behaviour of this consumer:

          – zookeeper.consumer.path : ZK Path for storing Kafka Consumer offset

          – kafka.consumer.id : Kafka Consumer ID. This ID will be used for accessing offset details in                                                                                      $zookeeper.consumer.path

          – consumer.forcefromstart: Consumer Force From Start . Default Consumer Starts from Latest offset.

          – consumer.fetchsizebytes:  Consumer Fetch Size in Bytes . Default 512 Kilo Bytes ( 512 * 1024 Bytes ). Up                                                                         this value to have a higher consumption rate.

Unlike the previous one, this one commits the offsets to the zookeeper and hence even if you change the driver program or restart the driver program, it will still read from the point where it has read previously using the consumer id.

Currently, both the receiver based approach will loose some blocks of data (If StorageLevel is set to MEMORY\_ONLY) if your processing delay exceeds the batch duration as a result of spark blindly drops unprocessed blocks of data to keep newly arrived data in memory. [SPARK-7398](http://ift.tt/1QJisUZ) has a design doc for introducing a back pressure logic in the receivers.

Global aggregation with HBase Integration

We can use HBase to keep the global aggregation of our streaming jobs. For that to happen at higher throughput, we can setup HBase in [fully distributed mode](http://ift.tt/1KnneI7) and after doing all aggregations on our DStream, we can update the HBase table with the data in the dstream. Here’s a [piece of code](http://ift.tt/1QJivAh) for reading the data from HBase and merging with the dstream data (unioning) doing a groupBy and updating back to HBase:

Some tips

We used these tips to optimize the Spark Streaming engine for our dashboard.

  1. Since we need to avoid lag in our spark streaming jobs the streaming job should not take more time than the batch interval itself. If it’s taking more time then we need to increase the batch interval.
  2. Spark Streaming system runs with 2 components the receiver and the Spark processing engine. The consumer takes up one dedicated core, hence spark.cores.maxshould be set to the ((total number of cores)-(the number of receivers)).  It should be set to a multiple of number of receivers.
  3. As suggested by the Spark Tuning guide, the number of tasks should be 2 to 3 times ( let’s call it k )the number of cores available. The number of tasks can be controlled by setting the block interval as each block is treated as a partition, and in spark tasks=partition*stages.

[](http://ift.tt/1KnneIb)

  1. Spark waits for spark.locality.wait when one of the nodes has no assigned tasks before transferring data from another Node(data locality has been set to NODE\_LOCAL). The default value for spark.locality.wait is 3000ms, which is not suitable for Spark Streaming. Since we are looking to process data with low latency.
  2. If you want to use any RDD multiple times, caching provides major performance boosts.
  3. Try to avoid logging with Spark as much as possible, Spark generates a lot of logs. Setting the suitable log level can improve performance significantly.
  4. Kafka Spark Streaming inbuilt receiver utilizes a Kafka High level receiver, we used a Kafka low level receiver. The low level receiver allows to handle offsets and  failures much efficiently .
  5. The low level receiver allows to set a rate limit, the rate limit is the amount of data that is consumed by the receiver. This was not possible with the high level receiver.
  6. We used a Boon Parser to parse the logs, as the logs were in JSON format. The Boon parser was faster than the Jackson and the Scala JSON parser.
  7. The time to process the data of a batch interval must be less than the batch interval time.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my charged off credit cards?,"This is my first time posting, and usually I just lurk here. I have been trying to find my answer in previous posts but I can't really seem to find the better choice.

I had about 2k in bad debt, and collections. Over the last year I paid off 1k and started rebuilding my credit.

I recently got a new car loan (with a ridiculous interest rate) and a new credit rebuilding credit card. With these two things I have managed to bring up my credit score around 20 points in the past 5 months. 

Now the only two things left on my credit report are two charged off credit cards from 2011 ($700 &amp; $300).

Im not sure what to do with these, It would take me a while to save to pay them off in full since I make almost double my car payment, so Im not paying that interest.

Or since its already been 4 years should I just wait it out and let them be gone on the 7 year mark?

I guess my real question is If I pay off the charged off credit cards, will it help my credit grow faster? or is it just the same letting the 7 years run its course?",finance,1433877066

personalfinance,"Re-financing our auto loan &amp; have been offered a ""cash out"" option, to take or not to take?","I currently am paying $360 a month at 17.82% interest on a 2004 Toyota.  This will be the 3rd time refinancing, our original payment was near $500 a month and at 24%! I've got it down quiet a bit over the last 3 years and have improved my husband and I's credit a ton since. Still high, but it's the best we can get right now and I'm happy with it.

So we owe around $8,000 on the vehicle &amp; they have offered 2 options.

First option would be to refinance at 16.49%, which would bring monthly payments to $294 &amp; some change. I would still plan to pay $375 per month with the extra ~$80 dollars going to the principal so we can get it paid off a bit earlier, we hope!

The second option is a refinance cash out option at $9,945, payments would be at $362 &amp; change, but we would plan to pay $400 total with the extra going towards principal to pay off early as well. That would give us around $1800 dollars extra in cash to put into savings, pay off existing credit cards with.


My husband went through a major job change last year &amp; we are still recovering our credit card balances after the pay switch. We have four cards, 3 are interest free with a total combined balances at around $2355, hoping to pay these three off over the next 3-5 months. The 4th card is sitting at $1700 (was just $2 grand 2 months ago) and has an interest rate of around 20%, monthly I'm being charged 35-50 in interest, and I've been only able to pay a max of $100 per month with the other card payments so the balance hasn't moved as far as I would have liked it. 


If we take the cash out option, we could use that $1800 to pay that credit card off and be done with it. Especially with that payback being built into the existing car payment, and us paying extra on the car, it's money we would be spending either way (if that makes sense) we'd just have the advantage of having that card FINALLY paid off and back to a zero balance.

Both of us are a bit above 620 credit scores and working hard this year to recover this credit card debt so I can start working on paying down around ~$5000 in medical debt I sadly incurred earlier this year due to a medical emergency. 



What do you think is the best option? We've both just turned 24 with a combined annual income of around $45,000 and are  hoping to enroll in college in the fall to better our lives and career options!",finance,1433878430
personalfinance,"Buying a fixer-upper home, maximizing mortgage options","I'm looking into buying a home again after 10 years of renting. I'm confident I know enough to pick a place I'll be happy living in for at least 10 years and am extremely attracted to he current mortgage rates. My challenge is how to buy a fixer-upper, improve it, and end up with a mortgage for 80% of the full renovated market value (no PMI), all while getting the best rate and paying the minimum in closing costs. My credit is solid and I'm responsible in general with money. Renovations would likely include solar panels (big state and federal tax credits), apartment in basement (potential rent in the future, home for aged parent), and generic improvements to bath and kitchen typical to buying an older home.

My options:

- buy the house with a traditional mortgage, fix it up on credit, refinance for full value (problem: 2 closing costs, rates will probably go up before I finish)

- buy the house with a traditional mortgage, fix it up on credit, get second mortgage to cover renovations ( problem: second mortgage will be higher rate, will be using my only two tax exempt mortgages)

- sell ETFs, pay cash for house, renovations on credit, get mortgage, repurchase ETFs (problem: capital gains, risk of market fluctuations while out, huge pucker factor)

Other?

Hybrid options like paying almost no points for first mortgage, then paying a point or two for refinance to lock in great rate would be interesting, but I'm concerned that the low rates won't be here long enough. Lenders in my area aren't interested in construction loans at all. Is there some other kind of loan I should be asking about?

A couple of years ago I purchased a home from a family friend on a lease to own type of contract. The contract is pretty simple with no doublespeak, etc. It says mostly the following:

I agree to purchase the home on 7/1/12 for a price of $105,000 with $10,000 due immediately. The remaining $95,000 will be financed at 5.5% with a 15 year amortization. This amount + the taxes and insurance are due on the 1st of each month. The remaining $7x,000 will be due after 36 months with an option to extend an addition 24 months at a rate of Federal rate + 2%. 


The house was purchased in 2007 for $230,000. The family friend bought it for $75,000 in 2010 in foreclosure. After some work into the place, I bought it for $105,000 on the above mentioned contract. The houses in the same neighborhood and similar size/features are up to about $140,000 right now.


I expect a few negative items to drop from my credit report this summer and I am hoping to secure financing for this house. I have a couple of questions I am hoping someone can help with.

- When I try to secure a loan, am I looking to Purchase or Refinance?
- Will some negative credit be looked over due to my 36 payment history, or do they really not care about some person-to-person contract? 
- Will negative credit be looked over due to loan amount being close to only 50% of the appraised value?

Hi /r/personalfinance. My financial situation has changed a bit. Initially, my parents told me they would pay for college. So I never saved up enough money to get a head start with college--I did save money, but with the intention I would use it for a living situation somewhere down the road.

Through a series of events, I've come to the decision that I need to pay for part/most of college now.

I've just transferred colleges and put a deposit down at my new university. I did not receive financial aid, but at the time I applied we said my parents would be paying for it.

College has yet to begin and we have not received a bill yet for the upcoming semester.

I'll be honest, I'm clueless when it comes to loans. I know what they are, I know about interest rates, and I know I might not just be able to waltz into a place and get a good loan. My HS showed us many horror documentaries of people who drowned in debt and bankruptcy because of college loans (grrr sallie mae). I do not want that to be me.

I'd like to start off with the best foot possible. I'm going to speak to my college's financial aid office tomorrow, but before that, I'd like to be more informed about my options.

If I apply for loans now, will they go towards next year's tuition? Or is it soon enough that they can be put towards this year's tuition? Or is that something I should ask my new school?

Where are some student-friendly loan places, that won't drown me with silly policies and land me in crazy debt? I've heard terrible stories about Sallie Mae (i.e. those documentaries I watched). But that's about it.

The fed announced a few months back about raising interest rates, some experts say a full point, but we never know till it actually happens. The other aspect is the house will slowly appreciate in value. This is always a gamble as 2008 showed us.  I am not worried about repairing the property due to my past work experience.  It’s a difficult decision to make and see what will be the most rewarding and best finical decision for me.  I am trying to figure out if the tax break will be substantial enough to be a factor, should I buy or payoff all debts? Thank you for the input",finance,1433897890

financialindependence,The ETF/Indexing bubble,"This is a topic I've been thinking about lately. Hoping to get some good feedback here.

&amp;nbsp;

This report contains a pretty interesting analysis of the relentless flow of funds into ETFs and the consequences.
http://horizonkinetics.com/docs/Q4%202014%20Commentary_FINAL.pdf

&amp;nbsp;

Some consequences already:

&amp;nbsp;

1) Major indices become mostly driven by monetary policy and fund flows instead of valuations or growth.

&amp;nbsp;

2) Volatility skew increases as monetary policy / fund flow factors lead to permanent and more extreme risk on / risk off behavior in the index vs. traditional valuation/growth factors.

&amp;nbsp;

2a) Bubbles and crashes are more severe because in addition to economic and monetary policy volatility there is the herding momentum effect of fund flows

&amp;nbsp;

3) Companies included in major indices converge in terms of valuation...they are either all overvalued or all undervalued with little dispersion.

&amp;nbsp;

What might burst the ETF/indexing bubble? Lackluster returns over the next decade.

&amp;nbsp;

Indexing IS NOT A FREE LUNCH! Investors who index are theoretically paying for the value of instant diversification and, increasingly, of making the ""socially acceptable choice"". Much like investors who pay a premium to buy put options, investors who index pay a premium in terms of owning overvalued megacaps with crappy growth...this fact has been papered over by continuing fund flows at the moment that keep boosting up the value of the index...sort of like how trailing 3 year tech stock returns were amazing in 1999 because of massive fund flows into that sector (although I'm really loath to make that obvious and flawed comparison...it does the job)

&amp;nbsp;

The argument that indexing has worked over the past hundred years is not a very strong one IMO. During a good majority of that time it was not possible to buy the index so fund flows were not a complicating factor.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to index fund flows megacap companies are buying back an enormous amount of stock. So two main drivers in the S&amp;P 500 right now are uneconomic actors...and you always want to be on the other side of the table from uneconomic actors.

&amp;nbsp;

If index returns are lackluster, that means ""intelligent"" money should flow into alternatives, whether that's absolute return hedge funds or simply smaller stocks that are outside major indices. Hedge funds will benefit from 1) lackluster index returns that are easier to beat and 2) inflow of funds from institutional money escaping indices.

&amp;nbsp;

Hedge funds win again!

&amp;nbsp;

I think the rise and potential fall of indexing will be one of the most important trends over the next decade.",finance,1433899847
technology,Amplified intelligence for everyone: The equal and opposite reaction to AI as we know it. Part 1 [OC],"If you're worried about your future in this increasingly high-tech economy, you're not alone. Software has been nibbling away at a wide variety of jobs for decades. Advanced robotics have started to take off and now we're hearing the warning bells of strong AI. Seemingly everyone is at risk; even software developers are enthusiastically automating away their own jobs.

In this series I'll be outlining a technological counterbalance to strong AI and perhaps even the socioeconomic changes we've begun to experience. I hope to provide enough background for the philosophically minded to explore the implications and for programmers to develop software implementations. I'll present my own implementation toward the end of the series. Please keep in mind that the problems under discussion are hugely complex and it will take more than a few thousand words to arrive at the concrete solution. Along the way, you will have to think for yourself.

##What can we do?

The big question, as ever, is what can we do? How do we meet this serious challenge? Many ideas are tossed around, from basic incomes to tax overhauls to revamping education. Yet ideas like those strike me as years away from reality while we are already feeling the squeeze.

A step in the right direction is to change the question of what can _We_ do to instead be what can _You_ or what can _I_ do. By thinking in terms of We, there's a tendency to took toward the imagination and actions of others, wait until more join in, then watch in discouraged silence as each nascent effort is quickly ripped apart by aggressive and well-practiced opponents.

Self-interest, on the other hand, is much more reliable and robust. What are your problems and what are you doing about them? You are responsible for your own well-being, after all; it's your future and your family's future on the line. At some point solving your problems will require committed and principled action. Then when you have momentum you'll be able to look toward larger problems.

##A problem of intelligence

Put simply, we have a problem of intelligence. The problems regular people face are so massive and complex that many of us are individually overwhelmed. Stuck. Discouraged. Our political, legal, technological, financial, and economic systems have become so intertwined as to be incomprehensible without organizational (corporate, government, etc.) support. Do we even know how to improve our positions anymore, let alone maintain them? Do we have the power to improve the quality of our lives? Or even maintain?

Our difficulties arise when the same organizations we depend on (whether as clients, consumers, or employees) have an abundance of intelligence and experience that is augmented by software, detailed information, and massive computing capacity. All while their primary interest is their own advancement.

This intelligence gap gradually widens as our organization's tools progress toward strong AI, making the situation seem ever more hopeless for the rest of us. It's not that we're stupid, it's that the complexity of our day-to-day society is exceeding the normal abilities of an individual. An individual whose intelligence remains unamplified despite access to so much consumer technology while organizational intelligence bulldozes ahead.

In the early Industrial Revolution we looked to mass education to prepare us for a literate post-agricultural society. Economic shifts caused by technological advancements demanded this response, and it worked. But we can't play that card again and now we're limited by its legacy. Our education system lags years behind our immediate needs and decades behind our apparent future needs. Like our many other mainstream institutions, education is unlikely to change significantly or quickly.

The solution is to amplify individual intelligence using modern methods and already-existing technology. A solution centered on the individual rather than the whole - the I instead of the We - because the whole has demonstrated an inability to change the way we need it to. This solution comes from the field of AI, but not how you might think.

##The standard model of AI

You can view this solution as the inverse of the standard model of AI (strong AI or otherwise). The standard model is centralized, exclusive, and opaque. Apple owns and controls Siri, Google owns and controls Now, and IBM owns and controls Watson. Each of these AI services is backed by extensive computing power and fed by a wide variety of data sources. Each is supported by massive funding and developed by expert teams of well-paid PhD's. Regular people may get to interface with these services but have no access to the internals, nor any way to verify what's going on under the hood, nor much of a grasp on the underlying algorithms.

This standard model promotes the interests of already-powerful organizations by amplifying their intelligence. They gain vast troves of information, then data-mine to discover patterns they then exploit for competitive advantage (against you). The income they generate (from you) is used to further amplify their capabilities. If we were looking to promote the interests of regular people, our choice of model would be nothing like this.

But if we want the inverse result - amplifying the intelligence of an individual instead of an organization - then inverting the standard model is a fine place to start.

##Inverted model

The inverse model consists of you and your computer, as in the computer you're using right now, not a remote datacenter, and not necessarily the Internet. And it's only you, whoever you are and wherever you are in life, not a team of PhD's. You own it. You control how it works. You can twiddle and tweak, and see what it's doing. Perhaps most uniquely, the only data source is you: not the wide Internet, not a knowledge base, and not a ruleset. Only you. It's a slightly strange concept, but give it some thought.

If you're a near-greybeard like me, you may recall that personal computing up to the late 90's was much like this. You bought your computer from the store and then you installed the software you wanted. If you wanted to connect to a wider network, you dialed into a BBS or your ISP. Other than that there was no worry about whether someone had hacked you, or was tracking your activity, or creating predictive models of your behavior.

Back then there was little question of ownership or control, unlike now with our few walled-garden app stores, centralized OS updates, and remote services by the dozens, each a data silo. We've consistently moved toward more Internet dependency, more ""cloud"", more remote services, less ownership, and less individual control. As complexity has continued to ratchet up, the underlying workings become less visible.

##Reality versus belief

Now, we've come to believe that computer intelligence is a complicated and expensive endeavour best left to the experts. That AI is for PhD's incubated by deep-pocketed organizations. And that we can no longer do anything significant without the Internet or datacenters or by first organizing into a venture-funded startup. But these are only beliefs.

The reality is that past visions of technology are still available to us; the unlimited potential of interconnected Turing machines remains in play. Intelligence is not as complicated as we seem to think. Our perspectives can change quickly and dramatically when we see a compelling path toward a more appealing future. And the technology we already possess can be applied to the problems that really matter to us.

In upcoming parts I'll continue to lay out the path toward amplified intelligence for individuals. In the process I'll define intelligence as well as other key concepts. The result is simple enough that you might dismiss it outright without an introduction like this. After all, we each need our own reason to take even the simplest action.

personalfinance,"Mortgage Banker/Bank overlooks upcoming town taxes on house for Re-Finance, changes terms 2 days before close","I just got a call a couple hours ago from a mortgage banker in regards to closing on a Re-Finance on our home. We started discussing this at the beginning of May. Tonight he indicated TWO DAYS before the close that the bank had overlooked accounting for upcoming town taxes on our home.

Instead of the pre-determined amount required in escrow for the close, we were informed that we have by tomorrow morning to come up with an extra 1,000 to put into escrow for the closing in order to maintain the 3.75% rate we were originally being given. 

The mortgage banker then outlined if we are not able to come up with this on short notice that we will have to take a rate of 3.99%. I feel like he is telling us this on as short notice as possible so that we do not have any time to adequately address the mishap. 

I cannot go to another lender due to my credit score dropped after our credit check, and also the interest rates have gone up significantly so we would not be able to lock in a rate this low again.

Obviously the sidebar has very valuable information but I've also read that you like to answer mundane situations. I'm not sure if mine qualifies as exciting or mundane.  
  
Anyway, here's my situation. I live in the good ol USA. In a state that rhymes with Blue Fampshire. So back in '02 my mother passed, that was when I was 12. I'm now bordering 25. I have a BS in biology. Now, the thing about Blue Fampshire is that it's not a super Biological STEM-career place. So finding a job has been hard (more on that later).  
  
So here's the kicker, my Mom left me her house which she bought from her mom's inheritance. I then sold this house in '13 for a nice sum. After purchasing a vehicle at 3.25% (only $1500 or so left to pay) and paying off my student loans and going on a crazy music festival trip I'm now at approximately $73,000 dollars to my name. About 75k with my job profits I have now.  
  
My last W2 says I make 17k a year at my job. So obviouuuusssly I'm trying to change that. I have a Significant Other with a well paying job who is slowly getting tired of me not being able to find work (actually that might not be the case but she isn't as happy as she could be because I spent 2014 planning my crazy music trip).  
  
So basically, I'm pretty financially stable, have an updated resume (even had some interviews!), a patient S/O, money, no idea what to do with my life.  
  
The idea in my head is to find stable employment in southern Blue Fampshire and then really start saving/working/saving/maybe pursuing future schooling. It's really overwhelming though and I feel kinda miffed about not finding a job since Feb of this year.  
  
Thanks for reading this and any advice you guys have will help a lot!! Sorry if this post meanders a lot, that's how it feels in my head.

personalfinance,Where to put scholarship money so that I can't touch it? Is that allowed?,"Hello,

So I am an upcoming second year medical student and was recently awarded a 10,000$ scholarship for academic merit and need. As I'm sure personalfinance knows, medical school isn't a cheap investment and most students rack up around 200k in debt over there 4 years. Now I already have a significant amount of debt - roughly 80K worth of debt from my first year of medical school and the one-year masters I did the year prior.

With that background here is my predicament and what I think makes the most sense based on my current needs. My parents were fortunate to pay for my room and board during my first year and have assured me they will do the same for year 2. However, we've discussed that I will probably be funding myself completely for years 2-3. My tuition expenses amount to roughly 38-40k a year and I'm awarded the maximum of 40,600$ from my direct unsubsidized loans which usually just covers tuition expenses. Last year 2014-2015 the interest rates on my loans was 6.21% and this upcoming year I believe they have dropped to 5.84%. Because of my current lack of need for this 10,000$ scholarship (my parents are paying room and board and tuition would be covered by my direct unsubsidized loans), I was thinking of putting that scholarship money away where I can't touch it for when I will need it during my 3rd and 4th year (mainly room and board). I was then going to continue to take the maximum amount on my direct unsubsidized loan instead of taking less because I was awarded a scholarship. This way I could possibly eliminate the need to take an extra Grad Plus Loan during my 3rd year which will have an interest rate of 6.84% and use my scholarship money to pay for room and board. That would just leave me with the possibility of taking an extra loan on my fourth year of medical school.

Does this make sense and is this my best option? If I do end up doing this, is it even legal for me to invest/put away scholarship money, which, as far as I know has just been direct deposited into my bank account, no strings attached? If so where do I put this money so that I don't touch it and is that a smart thing to do? Do I just set up a second account? Do I put the money in a 1 year CD?

personalfinance,Taking out a loan and buying a used car,"I will be a sophomore in college, come the start of the school year. Currently I am looking to buy a used car from a dealer, and will be taking a loan of about $8,000 from my local credit union.

personalfinance,Best high yield savings account?,"We have a chunk of money in savings that is a combination of our emergency fund and savings towards building a home next year.  My bank is giving me a whopping 0.03% interest currently.  I realized I could probably find more in loose change on the ground every month than what I'm earning there.  I'm considering transferring almost all of it to a high yield savings account to squeeze every penny out of this money I can, since it will just be sitting around for at least 9 months and I have zero tolerance for risk on this money so this appears to be my only option.  I've read good things about Ally Bank but My Savings Direct consistently has a higher interest rate (currently at 1.25%).  Has anyone used either?  What would you recommend?  I'm looking for an account that pays the highest interest on my money, without any crazy fees, and where it wouldn't take more than a day or two to access my money, should I need it in a pinch.",finance,1433945191

They offer lower interest rates compared to FHA, so I decided to go that route. They also offer a down payment assistance loan, which I took advantage of so I can have more money saved in the case of repairs. 

My loan officer at the original bank told me they offer both the SONYMA loan and the DPAL (down payment assistance). 

I go, sign everything, and the appraisal is ordered and completed. I get a voicemail from the loan officer about a week later saying that he found out they actually don't offer the DPAL, and the loan has to be cancelled. 

I've gone through another lender now and everything is fine, but my question is- can I be charged for the original appraisal? The bank that ordered it is where I do my banking currently, so I'm worried I'm going to check it and see $500 dollars missing for a pointless appraisal.

personalfinance,Medical school grad with $450k in loan debt at 6.3%; PSLF and feedback on my plan please!,"Hi folks,

I graduated from medical school. Yay! I'm in my thirties with $400k in student loan debt (undergrad, grad school, med school) that has ballooned to $450k at 6.3% interest. Boo! 

It gets worse. I started med school rather late and won't make real doctor money until about age 39, at which point I can realistically expect to **gross** about $300k/year (possibly a bit less). I have close to zero dollars in retirement savings presently. Ooof, it hurts to say.

Before you feel too bad for me or write me off as a total moron, just know that I knew what I was getting into. I'm looking forward to a rewarding and challenging career in medicine, and I'm extremely lucky to have had the opportunities I have had. Despite my debt I have lived and will continue to live a comfortable lower-middle-class lifestyle. Life is good.

So, I am beginning my residency and will be earning about $50k a year for the next 4 years. I will be making income-based repayment (IBR) on my loans during this time. The next 4 years will count toward public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). I know there is some speculation as to whether or not this program will continue to exist in its current form. Obviously this is out of my control. My income is relatively low compared to my enormous debt and interest rate, so I'm going to do IBR for the next 4 years regardless and time will tell what happens with the PSLF program.

So the current plan is to do 4 years of IBR, then seek employment that will qualify for PSLF. Even though my loan payments will grow tremendously when I make real doctor money, I will still have had 4 years of IBR to justify participating in the PSLF program.

I'm less certain about how to start saving now. My plan is to max out a Roth IRA and also pay a few thousand dollars per year into a Roth 403(b) (post-tax contribution) for the next 4 years. I will be taxed at such a high rate post-residency that this seems like a no-brainer. However, I recently read that people doing PSLF with IBR should consider minimizing taxable income by contributing to a pre-tax 401k/403(b) (as opposed to the Roth IRA and Roth 403(b) I was planning on) as a means to reduce monthly loan repayments. Any thoughts on this? Also, I currently live in a state with no state income tax. I'm not sure if this matters. Are pre-tax 401k/403(b)/traditional IRA contributions subject to state income tax when that money is withdrawn in the distant future (assuming I live in a different state)? If so, Roth seems like it's definitely the way to go.

PSLF is very strange. The normal strategy for loan repayment is to pay as much as possible as fast as possible, but with PSLF the best strategy is the exact opposite. It's scary to employ this approach without an absolute guarantee that it will pay off, but the money I save would be over $200k.

personalfinance,"Denied federal student loans, not sure how to stay afloat after my dad had a stroke and was forced to retire.","I'm in beauty school (Wisconsin) and my financial aid advisor says I can't take out any more federal student loans because $20,000 is the cap they allow (which is what my total tuition is). I've never even heard of that :/ 

Backstory: I'm 25, quit my job to go back to school, and have been living on about $7000 from my 401k and tax refund since then, plus my two jobs that just barley cover my portion of the rent. My father had a stroke though in March and between missing work (minimum wage at a salon (which I feel like I can't quit but may have to) plus a serving gig on Fridays and Saturdays at a restaurant trying its best to fail (I'm currently job searching for a replacement gig) and spending so much time at the hospital, as well as paying all the bills myself for two months, my bank account accidentally went in the negatives twice. I've borrowed from my parents and my SO (not live in) has bought most of my food, but until my dads short term disability kicks in I'm reasonably sure there is no way we can pay July rent. Imagine my surprise when I get the email from fafsa saying I qualified for $12000 plus a pell grant of $2300 for the 2015-2016 year! I honestly was going to accept it all, because I'm pretty confident about being able to pay $32000 in loans back after school ends. 

So I made an appointment with my financial aid office and no paperwork, just my advisor bruskly barking, ""You get $2300 in excess thanks to pell grants."" 

Naturally I'm rather confused. 
After a lot of emailing back and forth he finally says cosmetology students  only gets $20,000 in loans and nothing more from the government. Which I was never, ever told last year when he encouraged me to apply for financial aid for the 2015-2016 year. Last year my student loans and grants covered my entire tuition thankfully (which is $20000 total) and they encouraged me to apply again this year (my last year here). My only option according to my advisor is to pursue private student loans. He literally linked me the home page of Sally Mae and told me I'd need a cosigner with good credit (which I don't have). I'm going to search for scholarships as well (I've missed a lot of deadlines) and of course I'm trying to find a job to replace the serving job I have (nobody wants someone who can only work my schedule though) so I have no idea what I'm going to do. 

Does anybody have any suggestions on how to cope with this? Thankfully my dad qualifies for food share ( and in late July he will be getting his first social security check (only $1100), but that doesn't solve my problems long term. 

The frustrating part is I don't live an expensive lifestyle at all. I don't drive, I don't get my hair or nails done, I don't party, I work two jobs. My rent isn't even super expensive. I'm getting so bitter about pursuing the American Dream, that's for sure. I wish I had family that could help me out, like most of my classmates, or that I could have gotten more in student loans. I have a salon job already that will likely pay off very well (they're talking about taking me on after school, so consider me essentially a paid intern at this point), but it's surviving in the meantime I find difficult.",finance,1433950986

3. Total student loan debt: $350,000
4. Total liquid assets: $125,000
5. Annual combined non-rent expenses (food, entertainment, travel): $48,000
6. 401k: $50k
7. Other: GF has equity in prominent start up that will vest over 4 years, potentially worth hundreds of thousands and maybe even more.

Our rent was raised from $3,400 to $5,800 and so we've been forced to move. As part of this process, we are considering buying. 

We've decided that we want to stay in SF - we've looked elsewhere, and living in the East Bay or in one of the peninsula cities does not appeal to us. Essentially, our realistic/desired options are (1) buy a loft/condo in the $800k-$1m range, or (2) find a new apartment in the $3,000 to $4,000 a month range. Parents would help with a loan on the down payment (need 15% down).

My GF really wants to buy a home. I get the psychological appeal of home ownership, especially if we are going to be here for the next 4 or 5 years. And I also get the appeal of slowly building equity rather than paying rent to someone else. Investing in SF real estate has been a good call over the past decade. Who knows if that continues, but I do think SF will continue to become a richer, more desirable, and more prosperous city. 

At the same time, prices have spiked extremely sharply over the past 2 years (30%+), new inventory is coming online, and interest rates will start to rise soon (which works both ways...a cheaper mortgage, but also less demand for housing down the road). I think buying now carries a good degree of risk, where our equity could be wiped out, especially if the economy goes from super hot, to just warm. It also would force us to basically liquidate all of our savings, decreases our flexibility and ability to move, take on new jobs, etc. And on top of that, we still have a big chunk of student loans (we both are/were lawyers). Its basically the definition of golden handcuffs.

To a degree, this is a personal question based on what we value, but I'd be curious to hear PF's thoughts on buying an expensive home while still floating major student loan debt, in this situation. Is it always a bad idea to do so, or just sometimes? Any thoughts?",finance,1433962585
personalfinance,Paying for Grad School: Take out student loans or sell index funds? Or both?,"**TL;dr**: Do I take out all loans, sell mutual funds, or a combination of both to pay for grad school?

I will be attending a Top 10 MBA program this fall and am currently weighing my options on how to pay for this. I have served 6+ years in the Army after West Point so I will be receiving 60% of the post-9/11 GI Bill for tuition and living stipend. I will complete my service pretty much at the same time I stop school so that is when my income will end.

**Here is the cost for a year:**

*Educational Expenses for Year 1 (tuition, healthcare, other fees)*: $66,356

*Educational Supplies*: $1,300

*Student Living Expenses (estimate from school - includes, food, housing, transportation, misc expenses)*: $18,108

*Total cost of attendance:* $85,764

*Student Loan Borrowing Eligibility*: $88,920 (approx $3,150 in fees for loans)

Year 2 would be roughly the same but a few thousand cheaper, estimated at $87,000.


**Assets available for payment (not including checking acct, emergency fund):**

*Savings Account*: $27,000

*Taxable Index Funds (Vanguard)*: $114,000

I also have $110,000 in retirement accounts, both Roth IRA and TSP but was not planning on using that due to early withdraw penalties.


**GI Bill Benefits:**

$12,141 / yr for tuition

$792 / month for housing = $9,504 / yr


**Loan Options:**

I have been approved for two types of Federal unsubsidized loans. 

*Stafford Loan*: $20,500 / yr at 5.84% fixed interest rate

*Fed PLUS Loan*: $68,407 / yr at 6.84% fixed interest rate. This loan also incurrs a 4.292% loan fee, which I believe is basically the same as a front end load on a mutual fund. Interest is deferred until graduation as long as fully enrolled but interest does accrue.


I will have no other debts as I am finishing off my car payment early in the next two months.


*So, the question is*: Do I sell my mutual funds and pay the LT capital gains rate to pay for school over taking out federal loans? My current thoughts are to take the Stafford loan for $20,500 each year and use mutual fund sales for the rest of my expenses.  I feel that the Fed PLUS loan is a seriously bad deal with the 6.84% interest rate PLUS the 4.29% fee and that I would not be able to beat an almost 11% return if I left the money in the market.

A little backstory, my wife bought our first house when she was single and in school for ~$100k. Nice little two bedroom two bath. Fast forward 6 years and we’re married and pregnant with our first. Found an awesome house for a growing family and put in an offer. We can’t find a buyer on the old house, but we had several people ask about renting. One of our friends knew a professor who was starting at the local state university who wanted to rent, so we decided to rent it to her. We’re still renting it, and she just signed another 1 year lease starting August, but I’m 90% sure she’ll be moving on next year. 

(Prior to her signing, we put the rental back on the market to test the waters as the market is scorching hot. Between the fact that it’s a little small (~900sf) and our tenant doesn’t keep it in the most presentable shape, we pulled it after about 25 showings when she decided she wanted to rent again. We were asking ~$3k below where my wife bought it too…)

The house is now rented under my wife’s LLC – she works part time (~15 hours) as a consultant now which is the primary use of the LLC. Here are some financial info:

30 years old. I make ~75k/year. Her about 15k/year. Have a 1.5 year old, and #2 due any day.

Our current house is on a 15 year mortgage as well, and should be paid off before the kids leave for school.

I’ve been putting ~15% of my salary into a 401k for several years now. Have ~$50k in that. 

Have about $12k in a reserve account. May become college fund, but it’s not in a vanguard retirement 2030 retirement account and not a 529 account. No car debt (paid in cash, and I bike to work). No student loans (paid mine off heavily when I got out of school as they were in the 7.5% range, and in the middle of the financial crisis, it seemed prudent). Can you tell neither of us likes debt?

$30k left on the first (rental) house until it’s paid off. Currently have a 15 year, 3.4% interest loan on it that’s about $650/month, including taxes and insurance. Being rented for $850/month. All profits are being saved and put back into it as needed (had to buy a new washer and dryer last year, for example). House shouldn’t need a new roof for ~15 years, but may need a new furnace/water heater in the next 5 years. 

I have about $500/month in spare post-tax money that I’m not sure what to do with now. It seems to me I have a few options:

1. Put the $500 into the rental house and get it paid off. The house will be paid off in almost exactly 3 years. At which point that additional $500 and profits off the house can go towards college fund. I initially liked this option because I see the house as a large risk – it’s great when we’re renting it, but a vacancy will hurt. On the flip side, we’re constantly asked whether our tenant is staying (it’s a nice little house about 4 blocks from the university in a great neighborhood, so my wife doesn’t think we’ll go long without a tenant)
1. Put the $500 into a slush fund that can either pay off the house or cover the mortgage if we can’t find a tenant at some point. This could go in a lower risk bond fund to get somewhat similar performance to the house interest rate. This shouldn’t slow down paying off the house beyond about 2 months from option 1.
1. Keep putting the $500 directly into a college fund which should get a much nicer return while we have the time to allow compound interest to help us out.
1. Something else?

I think this is mainly a risk tolerance question, but I’m not sure if financially any one of these is clearly superior to the others. Am I missing anything?

One of the big questions I have is with taxes and my wifes LLC. When the house goes from nearly breaking even to making a significant profit, how will that affect taxes, and what kind of benefit would we see from removing it from the LLC?

investing,Understanding The Basics of The Thrift Savings Plan,"Most people that work for the federal government have a basic idea of what a Thrift Savings Plan is. However, investing for retirement can be difficult regardless of the particular type of plan that is used. As a result, it is important to understand the basics of a Thrift Savings Plan, more commonly referred to as the TSP. Things like TSP allocations and TSP investing are important to understand. It is also important to understand how this type of plan is related to a traditional 401(k) retirement plan.

The Basics
The basics of a Thrift Savings Plan are fairly straightforward. People that are eligible for this type of plan must work for the government and they can join immediately upon being hired. Individuals are currently able to contribute as much as $17,500 a year to their TSP account. This is limited by the maximum amount of money that the Internal Revenue Service will allow to be contributed to any retirement account. The Thrift Savings Plan does allow individuals to contribute the maximum amount allowed by the IRS. As a result, this amount can fluctuate depending on current IRS regulations. The best part about it is that the money that is contributed to the TSP account is not taxed, allowing individuals to contribute slightly more than $17,000 a year free of taxes. Furthermore, the government will match the amount of money that is contributed by the employee. Typically, the amount that is matched dollar for dollar is approximately 2% but in some cases, more money can be contributed by the government as long as a greater percentage is contributed by the individual employee. For individuals that qualify and that contribute an amount that corresponds accordingly, the government may contribute as much as 5% to the account on an annual basis. In addition, individuals can sometimes have more than one TSP account. For example, a person that has previously worked as a uniformed officer and now works in another capacity for the federal government can actually have two separate ESP accounts that work independently from each other.

TSP Allocations During Employment
One of the most unique things about a Thrift Savings Plan is that TSP Allocations can be accessed during employment, through loans and withdrawals. Employees have the opportunity to withdraw certain funds from their TSP account while they are employed in order to cover additional expenses that they may have for things such as major home renovations, auto repairs or anything else that incurs an unexpected expense on their part. By the same token, they may also qualify for loans that are based on the money that is in the TSP account. While they still have to pay the money back, this can be far more convenient than having to get a loan through some other resource in order to get the amount of money that is needed to pay for something unexpected.

TSP Investing
TSP investing is rather flexible, providing a wide range of opportunities for individuals to find a method of investing that works well for them. When it comes to personal investing, there are five different individual funds that can be accessed.

The I Fund, as it is known, is used to invest in the International Stock Index
The S Fund is used for Small Capitalization Stock
The G Fund is utilized to invest in Government Securities
The C Fund is for the Common Stock Index
The F Fund is the Fixed Income Index
Individuals also have the opportunity to invest with Lifecycle Funds. These funds are tailored towards individuals planning on beginning their retirement on a set date. Once the individual choses the fund, they are suppose to set it and forget it. The portfolio is allocated among the 5 individuals in order to provide the optimal portfolio.

During Retirement
When a person that has a TSP account makes the decision to retire, there are several options available. The money can be rolled over into a traditional IRA account. In this respect, a TSP account is much like a traditional 401(k). Furthermore, an individual has the option of receiving a single lump sum payment from their TSP account or they can receive monthly payments for a predetermined amount of time. It is up to the individual to determine the best method to receive payments from their account during their retirement. In addition, the amount of money that is available will depend largely on the type of investing that a person has done throughout their career and how much money has been made from those investments.",finance,1433989055

personalfinance,What to do when tax advantaged investment only has crappy fund options?,"**TLDR; up front:  I only have one tax advantaged investment option, but I don't like the funds available.  Stick with the tax advantage and poor returns? Invest in better funds without the tax advantage?**

Long and complicated:

I'm a US citizen working abroad for a US non-profit, and I anticipate doing so for the next ~30 years until retirement.  I claim the FEI exclusion which covers all of my income, so I pay zero federal and state income tax and have no 'earned income', which means I am ineligible to contribute to IRAs and some other investment options. I do pay FICA taxes, so 15.3% on everything.

The only tax-advantaged investment option I have available (that I know of, and I think I've considered all options) is a 403b through the non-profit.  There's a Roth 403b option which I've been using, which seems like a pretty phenomenal deal; money goes in with minimal taxes (just FICA), grows tax free, and can be withdrawn in retirement tax free.  

That's all great, BUT, I'm not a fan of the funds available to me.  Compared to similar Vanguard funds, the 403b funds available to me have significantly underperformed. Comparing the 2045 target date fund with Vanguard's shows over the past 8 years Vanguard's growing 35% and this other one growing 3.9%. That's huge. 3.9% over 8 years isn't even remotely keeping up with inflation, it would be better off in a half-decent savings account!

I also have $495K remaining on a commercial building that an agent estimated would sell for $900K-$1 million that I bought for my business that I currently am paying 6% interest which I would like to refinance.

Both my parents and I think this is a good idea, though I'm curious about any downsides.  We live in California and one of the benefits is that by deeding the property, we don't have to reassess the property value (I believe), thus keeping property tax low.

investing,5 Tips For Landlords,"Everyone knows that property is one of the most popular forms of investment. Unlike shares, bonds, trusts etc. property has an extra safety-net in that people will always need somewhere to live. That said, this by no means guarantees that any property investment is a good one. House prices fluctuate, as do the rental returns – not to mention the fact that mortgage interest rates are also variable.
All things considered, property remains high on the list of possible investments for many and perhaps one of the biggest factors in making the investment a success is – THE TENANTS! Here are five tips for potential buy to let property investors:
 
Always Use a Contract
When you are first setting out in the property investment world, it can be tempting to cut corners to save a few pounds. Furthermore, you may already have possible tenants in mind; friends, family or even work colleagues. I previously lived with another couple back at University in my friends house and things actually got pretty ugly when it was time to leave. The other couple had informally agreed to live there for 6 months and wanted to leave after 4. There was no contract in place between ‘friends’ and as a consequence the friendship was no more – Don’t mix business with pleasure if possible.
Others will try and wrangle their way out of contracts on technicalities. In the UK a number of ‘standard’ contracts exist, so you won’t have to pay a lawyer to write one from scratch and solicitor’s rates can actually be pretty reasonable. If you want to save more money, you can actually download one of the tenancy agreements online and edit it yourself – although it might be an idea to have a lawyer check it over.
 
Get the Mortgage Overpayments Right
When you are investing in property, it can be tempting to get too carried away with the numbers. While paying of your mortgage(s) early is a great idea in principle, ensure that you don’t set yourself up for a fall. Reduced term mortgaged (15 years instead of 25 years for example) are very popular, but can also get you into deep water if the interest rates rise or your property goes through a period of being empty. Check with your mortgage provider, but you can often make overpayments within a given limit (usually 10% of the balance) without paying a penalty. This way, you can take a 25 year mortgage and overpay as and when you can afford to – you are not obligated to meet the higher monthly repayments.
 
Have a Contingency Fund
Unlike with stock and shares, an investment in property often requires ‘topping up’ to ensure that it continues to provide a sizable return. Curtains, carpets, walls, furniture, gardens etc. all need repairing and fixing at some point. Many landlords will charge tenants from their security deposit if they are directly responsible for the breakage of something, but soft furnishings all get tired with time. It might be a good idea to keep a ‘spares and repairs account‘ for the unexpected replacement of an appliance or to help you pay the mortgage if there is a gap between tenants.
 
Use an Agency or Do It Yourself?
The temptation when buying property as an investment is to think that you can manage it all by yourself. As your empire starts to grow, the demand on your time will also increase. Agencies charge a small fee, but can take care of many of the tedious tracks in the process. You don’t want a criminal or somebody who was evicted for trashing their last flat moving right into yours do you? Agencies can provide background checks for a fee – which you can usually pass on to the tenants and also take care of any midnight call-outs – not to mention finding the tenants in the first place!
 
Ensure That You are Insured
While this might seem blatantly obvious, it is by far the most important consideration of the lot. In my five years experience of being a student, I know of at least two groups of people who caused a fire and had to move out while the fire damage was repaired. Taking the toaster into your bedroom when you are blitzed may seem like a good idea at the time; but bed covers and heating elements don’t go well together! Many specialist companies like CIA Insurance can offer policies and advice to ensure that you have the right level of cover. The last thing that any property investor wants is to owe the bank a mortgage for a property that was destroyed. Fire is not the only force that can be of detriment to your rental – flooding, mold or disastrous tenants can all cause your property value to plummet!

All home loans are around 3.5% except for our $65000 HELOC on our primary (5%, is variable at prime + 1% with a floor of 5%; payment is approximately $150/month right now).  We have 1 auto loan at 1.99% ($20,000 balance; $299/month payment), another loan at 0% ($5000 balance, $125/month payment) and a 401k loan ($19000 at 5% but the 5% is 100% mine and goes to the balance of the 401k fund upon payment).  With approximately $3000-$5000 net in excess every month, I have been able to reduce the HELOC balance in half from $65,000. I keep a minimum of $10000 in the bank.

According to statistics, Sydney's housing prices is 16% above the national average. 
With a record low interest rates of 2% and a strong influx of investors from domestic and particularly over sea, isn't this a slight reflection of what happened in 2008 in America, where everyone got a little greedy?

personalfinance,I just heard back from my Financial planner...,"A few weeks ago, I asked the hivemind for input regarding a LIRP I was considering. You all posted some great responses and many of them I put to him as questions before I move forward with it. I am now posting his replies to see what yall think.

""Prior to our next conversation I have included some brief answers to your questions.

First things first — I am obligated by a fiduciary standard which simply means I have a responsibility to put your needs above any product or service that I may offer.

And…

Just a quick summary.

At the end of our last discussion we concluded, among other things, that 1) you needed sufficient protection as the primary provider in the home.  You are the most important asset to build around. 2) Because your tax bracket is at the 15% level we agreed that current savings into a traditional 403B (tax later account) was not the best long term approach so we looked at the Roth concept (Tax now - Tax Free later).

Here we go...

If I put 300/month in for 12 months, and then surrender the policy, what would I get? *Let’s review the actual illustration to discuss details.  The LIRP is a long term plan (10+ years) so there would be surrender cosy which could hurt principle if fully liquidated anytime in the first 10 years.  Again… This is not a 1 to 10 year plan but a career/retirement plan.*
•         How is this plan different from an IUL? *The LIRP is an IUL - although not all IUL’s are created equal.  When done right we actually customize to your particular situation which gives us the ability to control benefit and cost.*
•         When and how are Capital Gains assessed on this plan? And if I self-finance, will the interest I pay myself be subject to Capital Gains? - *In a LIRP all growth is tax deferred and when taken out properly withdrawals are tax free.  No capital gains or ordinary income taxes are assessed.  If you self finance you are paying interest back to yourself not to Uncle Sam.*
•         Why would I not be better served by buying term life and investing the difference?  *The answer to this boils down to one word… Income.  I can illustrate that when you match the income from a LIRP to a Roth a Roth cannot compete (assuming we use same interest rate for comparisons).  The power is in how you take the money out.  When it comes to Buy Term - Invest the difference most think in terms of accumulation not income on the back end.  When you take money from a LIRP properly you take as a loan vs. a distribution (huge difference).  I can illustrate more clearly when we talk.""*

I am a 20 year old student in my 3rd year out of 5 at an engineering university. I am one who always likes to plan things out years in advance, which is why I am making this post.

The college I go to is ~$60k/yr. I received a merit-based scholarship for $25k/yr for the 8 academic semesters I will be studying there. I'm in the university's cooperative education program, hence the 5 years and only 8 academic semesters (I think it's a bit irrelevant to go into the explanation of it, so I won't). My father, thankfully, is well-off enough that he is paying for everything up front and is only going to make me pay back half of the total cost once I graduate (in 2018). I've done the calculations, and I will owe him around ~$30k with no interest rate. I already have a job offer from the company I am co-op'ing at, and expect to make anywhere from $75-85k/yr immediately after college (either at this company or another). I really would like to move out and be independent, maybe even move into an apartment with my girlfriend, or save up for a house, etc. I don't have a set amount of years I have to pay back my debt in, but I usually am one that likes to pay back debts as soon as I can. What should I do?

I switched to being a contractor, and because of that I get paid in full with no taxes taken out. Because of that, I'd like to be REALLY careful and tuck money away in my savings for tax season, so that I'll have some peace of mind when it comes time to paying.

With that said, how do I figure out how much to put aside? I know there's state and federal taxes as well as SS, but my mother told me as a contractor I don't need to pay into SS? I'd love some clarification and how I can figure out how much to put aside.

I manage my parents' 401k and it's in TIAA-CREF. About 4 months ago I took over their account for them and noticed they were 40% in bonds. After the crash in 2008 they had my idoit uncle move some things around, so what did he do!? Sold off the index funds that had lost a bunch of money and put that money into bond funds not even keeping up with inflation!!! 



So I took over, sold of their bond funds and reallocated them into a well diversified position mostly in equities. This was 3 months ago... When the market was relatively high! They're 15 years from retirement, but a majority of their portfolio was moved to equities at the wrong time (my fault). However, in the 3 months they're up 14.5% (speaking in annual terms). Now is a good time to sell out and sit on the side lines. I'm putting them on the dollar cost average track as soon as the market corrects, but it is clear to me that the index funds are going to get hammered when interest rates rise. 


If I sell my position in equities would the safest thing be money markets?? I'm assuming I'll have to keep a bulk of their portfolio in the low yielding money markets for over a year while the market corrects. Then dollar cost their monthly contributions all the way to the bottom.

I can't really tackle this issue as I signed on for another year and am locked in.

personalfinance,Taking out a personal loan to get out of a loan I'm underwater on?,"Hello everyone,

Up until about a year ago I'd say that I've been relatively savvy with money, but once I graduated from college and got established in promising job I took a loan to buy a motorcycle. I didn't put a down payment on it due to the interest rate I qualified for and the fact that I had money in savings to cover it. 

Big mistake. Although I was handling the payments gracefully and with room to spare, I ended up losing said job and was forced to use my savings for a stint to live off of. 

I'm currently in a new job and having the motorcycle stresses me out more than enough to outweigh the joy of having it, but I owe about $3,500 more on it than I can sell it for. It's financed at a 1% interest rate and monthly payments including insurance are around $450, and this isn't taking maintenance into account.

I've been considering taking out a personal loan to pay down the bike to it's redeemable value, but at the end of the day I'd still have debt, but nothing to show for it minus an extra $200 a month.

personalfinance,"Mortgage going down $300 a month, should I put that money toward the mortgage or my credit cards?","I have an adjustable rate mortgage that is going way down, from a 5.75% rate to a 3% rate (this is locked in for a year).

I recently became a California independent contractor in January, but did not make any profit until the 2nd quarter (May). I used Intuit for the quarterly federal estimated tax but I just found out today that the state also requires an estimated tax as well, and reading through the materials is really making my head spin.

I was under the assumption that I did not need to pay estimated taxes if I did not make a profit, but that does not seem to apply to California's estimated tax for individuals. It says that I must pay 100% of the tax from 2014's return...and I'm not sure if that refers to my single tax return from when I wasn't a contractor. This would mean that I've already missed quarter 1 and 2 payments, and I'm really not sure what to do...

personalfinance,Which debt would be more financially responsible to be payed off first?,"First off, hello to my favorite subreddit!

Here's the situation:

I'm getting married to my incredible fiance in August. I have always been opposed to borrowing money unless it is a necessity. Unfortunately, two events have come up in the course of our relationship where borrowing money was the most realistic option. After we get married in August, I plan on overhauling the way we both handle our money so that we can get out of debt as efficiently and quickly as possible. Here are the two debts and a question to follow. Also, feel free to give random insight, as I always appreciate wisdom and the experiences of others. 

The debts:
First, was her school loans, a mix of subsidized and non-subsidized loans totaling just over 10k. Both the subsidized and non-subsidized loans are at an interest rate of 4.5%. The subsidized starts accruing interest next May when she graduates, and the non-subsidized is accruing interest now.

The second debt was taken out in my name (as I had far superior credit) when her car was worth less than it would cost to get it in good working order. It made the most sense at the time because the bank offered me 3.5% and her 17%, and I was 99.99% certain that I would be marrying her. The total debt remaining is about 5.9k.

The question:
I have a solid understanding of the snowball and avalanche methods of paying off debt. I am all about efficiency, and intend to pursue the avalanche method. That being said, I've been told in the past that insurance companies charge more for car insurance on cars that are still on lien to a bank. First, is this true? And is the amount significant? If so, would it be more efficient to pay off the car payment first, with the intention of putting all of the extra money that was for the insurance towards the school loans?

Pardon my naivety, as I was raised by a single mom who didn't teach me a whole lot. In every single way except biologically, google, youtube, and reddit are my Dad. 

Again, I would appreciate any and all insight, even if it's a bit off-topic.",finance,1434064326

I graduated July of 2014, with my associates degree, and proceeded to work in Colorado at a resort in Winter Park Now at the time, everything was manageable. Student loans weren't in effect until February of 2015, so I purchased my first vehicle at 18000 dollars, with a monthly payment of 289 dollars. However, when student loans finally hit, the total monthly payment was over 900 dollars, through Sallie-Mae. I attemped to refinance my loans, but they wouldn't offer me any solution other than to not pay them for 3 months, but the loans would still collect interest.  Moving forward, a recent fallout with the company in Colorado caused me to have to move back with my parents in Florida.  but the only cooking jobs I can find in the area are minimum wage 8.05/hr, but I managed to find a call center job for 10/hr. Ive stopped paying on my loans for the three months, until I can get back on my feet.

personalfinance,I am receiving a personal injury settlement and am lost about what to do with the money.,"So a little backstory, I was involved in an accident a little over a year ago. I was hit by a car while biking and broke my leg. The accident was the drivers fault and I recently reached a personal injury settlement with their insurance company. After my medical insurance company gets their money back I will have around $58,000.00. I have never had even remotely close to this amount of money in my life. I am a graduate student and live comfortably on about $28,000 a year. I am not married and I don’t have any kids. My question is this, what is the best thing to do with this money?

I have three remaining student loans from my undergraduate education. One I am paying off now ($10,600 remaining, at 3.67% interest) and two that are deferred ($4,130.00 at 6% interest and $3,110.00 at 5.6% interest) but are accruing interest as I had to start paying them because I took a year off before starting grad school. I also have a credit card debt of $2,886.00 at 12.24% interest (mostly from the injury and moving expenses last year).

I will definitely pay off the credit card immediately, but what about the student loans? Should I pay them all off or just the two with the higher interest rates? I’m leaning more towards paying them off just to get out of debt.

I understand that there are many threads regarding enormous college loans and I have taken a look at them. However, I would just like people's input on my own financial state (or lack thereof) and the best way I can go about making sure I do not make things worse and proceed in the best possible way.

I have finished my undergraduate career in three years, however have accumulated a massive burden of debt which I now understand was quite a mistake... but too late for that. 


Here's how my current loans look:

**Federal**

* $2,000 @ 6.80%
* $7,500 @ 4.66%
* $6,500 @ 3.86
* $3,500 @ 3.40%

=$19,500

**Private**

* $2,500 @ 5.00%
* $25,000 @ 4.49% (*variable, on prime rate)
* $28,000 @ 3.00% (*variable, on prime rate)

=$55,000

I currently have ~$10k and am thinking about paying off at least the high interest loans with some of this money. I currently work, but at $12/hr I feel it is almost pointless to throw my money at these huge debts. I pretty much have zero expenses other than occasionally going out to eat or out with friends. 

This fall I will be entering dental school which I expect will cost me another $240,000, all of which will be borrowed. At this point I am looking at taking out max unsubsidized federal loans which are at approx. 5.9% interest rate for ~$45,000 and the rest I will take out through a private lender for lower interest rates. 

Upon graduation I anticipate to start at $110k to $140k, but obviously this varies depending on area. I would like to be able to live frugally and attack this debt as aggressively as possible in order for it to not control my life. 

I would like to know if it is a better idea to take out a graduate plus loan (something like 8.9% interest with 3% upon borrowing) instead of the private loan, however the interest seems way too high. I understand I will not qualify for income repayment, etc. with my private loans. 

With the money that I have now, is it a good idea to pay off the high interest loans as well as start paying off any accumulating interest or what would be best?

computers,Computer slow when not used for &gt;24 hours. Actually possible?,"Hi,

first of all, I considered posting in /techsupport. But I don't have a specific problem, more a genereal question about computers.

Also, I work in IT, so my understanding of computers is rather good (don't want to brag, I think this information is useful).

My private PC still has an HDD, and therefore usually takes three to five minutes to be fully operable. Starting programs also takes a minute, but other than that, it's fast enough. (Core i5 4670K, 8GB DDR3, GTX660).

**Issue:**  
Whenever I don't use the PC for more than 24 hours, it becomes completely unusable afterwards. Last week, I used it normally every day, until Sunday. Since then I didn't have time to use yet. Yesterday (Thursday), when I started it, it took 5 minutes to boot (boot!=fully operable). I usually start programs by pressing Win-Key and searching for the program. The search did not work, not even after another 5 minutes. Task-Manager (from taskbar) didn't come up, and after ctrl+alt+del, nothing happened. Another 2-3 minutes later, I got an error message that Windows was not able to enter the secure screen, and returned to the desktop (still not able to search, etc). At this point I was fed up and shut down the PC.

Yesterday was the worst occurence of my problem, but it has been happening for about a year now, EVERY SINGLE time. Usually it was just about 5 times slower (i.e. taking 10-20 minutes to be operable), and then slowly restoring the usual speed. On the next bootup, everything is normal again.

How can it be that the PC slows down so tremendously, after it has been shut down for longer than a day? No matter how hard I think about it, there is just no plausible explanation for me. But it does happen.

personalfinance,Post undergrad financial planning (Come blow holes in my plan!),"Okay here we go... I am writing this out as much for my sake as for the sake of this post. 

The background:

I just graduated University and have a job lined up for September where I'll be making $60,000/year before tax. I expect to be at this job for at least 4 years. I'll be living in my mom's basement for a while, but goal #1 is to buy a house as soon as possible. I will have $15,000 in debt when I start, at an interest rate of prime+1, or 4% after I'm done travelling the world. I am also expecting a large tax return nearing 5 figures in the spring. 

Houses are incredibly cheap where I live. We are talking 2 bedroom townhouses for under 100k and character homes downtown for under 150k. Houses can be found with a suite already in for under 200k.

The plan:

I plan to buy a house/townhouse under 150k before Christmas if possible. I'll rent out a room/the suite for approx 400/mo or 1000/mo respectively. The goal here is to provide me with a very cheap mortgage short term, and an income property later on down the road. I'll carry the debt until spring when I can dump the lump sum of my tax return into it and then focus on paying it off. 

It's feasible for me to save up 10k by Christmas so here is my question... 

Should I just get in the market on the cheapest thing possible, allowing for quicker ownership with 10-15% down payment, or go bigger and shop for a house with a suite, and have a down payment of maybe 5%?

Bitcoin,how about a soft-fork opt-in blocksize increase that is future proofed and non-controversial,"while its surprising you can actually increase Bitcoin blocksize beyond 1MB by soft-fork, eg via extension blocks and a few other ways also. See https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg07937.html and in more tech detail https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg07927.html

I think if you want to look at it simply an extension block approach is better in most regards than a hard-fork fixed-size block:

- users can opt-in (if you like 20MB blocks go ahead and use them)
- users who dont want them can stay on 1MB
- miners dont lose revenue (they pool mine extension blocks if they dont have bandwidth)
- its a soft-fork not a hard-fork so there is no divergence risk
- its opt-in so its not forcing by coercion or lose-lose compromise commercial interests on users
- it allows multiple different blocksizes to be used in parallel for increasing scale/security tradeoffs, if needed a 100MB or a 1GB block could be created, so its future proofed.
- obviously the bigger the blocksize the higher the centralisation, but thats a user risk tradeoff they can take.
- its less centralising than people going offchain and using hosted wallets
- it doesnt force a one-size fits all compromise which gives neither security nor useful scale.
- it avoids damaging the blockchains decentralisation level which is what provides bitcoins interesting features.
- in the mean time we should work on algorithmic improvements, O(n^2) just *can not* work for the mid-long term. lightning write-cache layer can change that, but this would give us time to work on that.
- we can roll it out immediately (without a year delay to give people time to upgrade as with the hard-fork) because its not dangerous for divergence risk
- users and companies can upgrade organically as they prefer. eg say coinstore.xzy wants to go into microtransactions or a has a lot of users; they upgrade their server. if they offer users SPV wallets they upgrade them, or work with the wallet vendor to.
- if some companies are not interested to upgrade, thats their call - if they care a enough about scale for their type of application they have the option to.
- its forward and backwards compatible so any wallet works with any other wallet at all times.
- advanced wallets or services may allow you to pay higher fees for the security of being on the more secure 1MB chain

My mom has an awesome credit score and co-signs the loans with me, and we've gotten a private student loan as low as 3% variable before. When I look at the federal unsubsidized I see that they are around 4-5%.

I currently have 50k in student loans, 30k of which are private, 17k fed unsubsidized, and 3k fed subsidized (yay!). I have one semester left and the loan would only be about 4-5k (tuition 10k) because of the money I'm making this summer at an internship.

personalfinance,It has now been six months since I filed my tax return and the IRS still hasn't given me my refund. Where do I go from here?,"I filed in the middle of January. I had nothing out of the ordinary on my tax return. I am owed a little over $2,000 on my federal refund. 

Initially I was sent a letter asking me to verify my identity in March, which I did. I received my state tax return the next day.

 I then waited until April and called them after not hearing anything about my federal return. The IRS rep on the phone said I needed to re-verify my identity, so we went through the steps of doing that together. She then said I will receive my return within 30 days. Okay, I know the IRS is bogged down this year so the wait is understandable...

Fast forward a month and still nothing so I called on the 11th of May asking what's going on. The representative said that there is a hold on my name. She would not tell me why or what department put it there. She said the department that did it can't be contacted anyway. She said she did something on my account and that the mysterious department withholding my money now has 30 days (this is getting fucking ridiculous) to either contact me via phone or letter to explain why they've held my money and ask for whatever information they require, or for them to give me my refund. 

It's been a month since that call and still nothing. Looking at their refund site it says ""Your tax return is still being processed."" It's said this since the day I filed in January so I know nothing has changed on the status of my account. 

I have to take a day off work whenever I want to call them because each call takes 3+ hours. I'm not able to do that this month because of how busy work is at the moment, so I feel like I'm screwed.

Has anyone else here been in this position? Did you ever find out what the big hold up was? How did you get the IRS to pay you? Is there some kind of advocacy group I can get in touch with to motivate the IRS to give me the money I am owed? This is really starting to make me angry.",finance,1434118150

I make between $3000 to $6000 a year depending on how much I work. Each paycheck is a 2 week period. Here are the details: 

* Three paychecks ago, my paycheck was decreased for federal income tax, FICA, and state income tax. Total taxes amounted to about 10%. My income was approximately $110.

* Two paychecks ago, my paycheck was decreased for federal income tax, FICA, but NOT state income tax. Total taxes amounted to about 7%. My income was approximately $75.

1. Standard deduction for Single Filing Status is $6300 for 2015. What does this mean for my income taxes that I already paid?

* Combined Gross Income: $109,000/year
* Combined NET: ~$4,500/month
* Debt: student loans $450/month (paid off soon)

I'm 3 courses into an associates degree that I hope to have earned about two to two and a half years from now. After I do that, I plan to quit my job and transfer to a 4-year school.

**My Question:** What are the best places I can put my medium term savings so that they're not languishing in my .01% APY savings account? I've looked at a couple of ""high-yield"" savings accounts, but none that would seem to earn me more than about $300 total over two years at my planned rate of saving. Even two year CDs don't have particularly impressive interest rates. I've thought about investing some of it in my nascent Roth IRA, but the problem is that I can't withdraw the principle without penalty for 5 years unless I use it for qualified educational expenses. I'm fortunate that my parents plan to pay my tuition, and I am only responsible for my living expenses and textbooks.

Current Debt:

Gross income: $125,000 annual  
  Maximize 401k ($18000), Roth IRA ($5500), and HSA ($3300) annually  
  Current 401k balance = $18k, Roth IRA = $11k, HSA = $1.6k  
  Employee 401(k) match: $0.50 of every $1 up to 6% = $3750  
  Emergency fund = $13k so far, contributing $500 per month  
  Travel fund = I save $4k per year, then spend it for travel  

When I calculate my savings rate, do I include my $1500 per month student debt payments?

PMI:		        $71/month

80% LTV:		$112,800

Interest Rate:	4%

My (very possibly flawed) math says that I will be paying PMI for another 71 months, for a total of $5041. It will take a $16,400 principal payment in order to cancel.

Is my thinking/math correct, and will this be a wise use of my savings? Or should I invest that into the a fund somewhere else?

This plan will only save me $71/month, but would it be worth it in the long run?

My question to you guys is which student loan is right for me?  

Some backstory to what I've been doing for the past 5 years.  Since my junior year (2011) I've been working and saving diligently to go to a University.  In 2012 I got a paid internship at a bankruptcy law firm and learned the horrors of discharging student loan debt.  This was in my senior year of high school and this is when I decided that going to a community college was the best course of action to save me roughly $60k for two years at my dream school (UC Davis).  By the end of my Senior year I have managed to save up $9k.

The next three years, I pick up an easier job that pays $10.50/hr (2012-2015) and also another job that pays $25/hr (2014-Present).  

I have collectively saved up $21,000 in my savings that is earning .01% interest and I have another $9000 in my stock portfolio.  

Effectively I have $30k saved for one year at UC Davis.  My admission will cost ~$27k to live on campus.  

However, I plan on sitting on the money I have saved and pull a loan for the two years I am at UC Davis.  I do not plan on working at all while at Davis, and plan to graduate in two years time.  My major is Environmental Policy, Analysis and Planning.

Could someone help me with the right student loan for me?  Wells Fargo (the bank I use), provides additional discounts for having a PMA (.50%), and a qualifying consumer checking account (.25%) which I have both of.  

Also I have been building up my credit (with a wells fargo credit card) since my junior year of high school. I have never missed a payment to the day, never had an interest charge and they constantly raising my credit limit (at the moment it's to $2400).

The fees are 28000 for the first year and i have been approved for around 17000 in scholarships and grants and federal loans leaving around 8000 for me to pay. My parents have offerd to pay for them but we are new to the country and i would like them to save up some money right now instead of paying for my college. 

My parents just started working in their field after working a minimum wage job for around a year. My dad makes around 85k and mom makes 40k right now. Mom works 24 hours a week and she will start working fulltime in a few months but that's still a query.

I am looking into SallieMae,Wells Fargo,Discover and some other loans. What else should i be looking into?

When I applied for FAFSA in Jan, my parent's income was around 2400/m which made me eligible for a few financial aids. Will that be affected now as my parents make decent money or that will be carried over to next year?

Now that school is over and loans are due I have been researching my options. I spoke to numerous individuals in the department of education that told me about the Federal Loan Repayment program. Basically if I work for the Federal government or a non-profit and don't earn over a certain amount I will get mitigated payments for 120 months and then the rest forgiven. I work for myself and only report some of my capital gains to the IRS. I started a 501(c)(3) about four years ago and am seriously considering washing my loans through this program. I spoke to two supervisors at department of education that informed me that I could use the non-profit and sign up for the program.If I pay the minimum amount on the repayment program it would be about $31 a month for 120 months and the rest is forgiven. So, basically $3,720 for a free $100,000. My portfolio is in a trust where I manage it and I have a paid off house in the same trust. Any insight or help will be appreciated.

personalfinance,Buying a house in Australia,"Hello from Australia (sorry to disappoint those expecting a G'day). I was wondering if any one was familiar enough with the Australian house market, particularly Melbourne or Sydney, to give me some advice.

As you might have guessed, I'm from Australia. My wife and I are finally doing well enough financially to start looking for a place to start a family. We've managed to squirrel away enough for a comfortable down payment. It's taken nearly ten years given that so much has been blown on rent. Unfortunately because of the nature of my work I've had to live in the inner city which is part of the reason why it's been slow saving up. Again, because of work we need a place in the inner city (e.g. 15 km radius).

Therein lies the problem. Houses here are ridiculously expensive. From what I observe, the average house price is $1.1-1.3m, the cheapest around $800k ( this would be for a little townhouse or really rundown place). 

People around me seem to be buying such places without batting an eyelid - and these are ppeoplee I know and I'm pretty sure neither earn nor save more than us.  How do they do it? I've spoken to the banks who seem very keen on providing huge loans -  like up to $800k. While sure I could then afford the house of my dreams, how on earth will I pay off the loan? At a 5 percent interest rate, annual interest repayments would be $40 k alone! I'll be forever paying off interest and barely making a dent on the principal.

I'm by nature a very proud person so I'm mindful that this could be clouding my judgement. Is this simply a fact of life that I've just woken up to?  

I would like to thank anyone who's read this far. I hope I haven't come across as an entitled prick. My wife and I are very privileged and and secure financially and we're really grateful. There obviously are many who are in worse off positions and I freally fel for them. There's been a lot of talk about this in the media, but it don't see a quick fix solution.",finance,1434158284

personalfinance,Choosing the Right Student Loan,"My question to you guys is which student loan is right for me?  

Some backstory to what I've been doing for the past 5 years. Since my junior year (2011) I've been working and saving diligently to go to a University. In 2012 I got a paid internship at a bankruptcy law firm and learned the horrors of discharging student loan debt. This was in my senior year of high school and this is when I decided that going to a community college was the best course of action to save me roughly $60k for two years at my dream school (UC Davis). By the end of my Senior year I have managed to save up $9k.  

The next three years, I pick up an easier job that pays $10.50/hr (2012-2015) and also another job that pays $25/hr (2014-Present).
I have collectively saved up $21,000 in my savings that is earning .01% interest and I have another $9000 in my stock portfolio.  

Effectively I have $30k saved for one year at UC Davis. My admission will cost ~$27k to live on campus.  

However, I plan on sitting on the money I have saved and pull a loan for the two years I am at UC Davis. I do not plan on working at all while at Davis, and plan to graduate in two years time. My major is Environmental Policy, Analysis and Planning.  

Could someone help me with the right student loan for me? Wells Fargo (the bank I use), provides additional discounts on the interest rate for having a PMA (.50%), and a qualifying consumer checking account (.25%) which I have both of.  

Also I have been building up my credit (with a wells fargo credit card) since my junior year of high school. I have never missed a payment to the day, never had an interest charge and they constantly raising my credit limit (at the moment it's to $2400).  

Should I choose a fixed interest rate, or a variable interest rate? Please help me make an educated decision, I appreciate it!

personalfinance,When Default is the Only Option: How to Default Gracefully (Student Loans),"(xposted with r/studentloans)

I'm 30, 2.5 years out of college, and I can't pay my student loans. Here is my loan summary:

Navient:
-46,100.53 ;4.75%; 962.52 past due (private)
-19,204.33; 3.25%; 774.71 past due (private)

Great Lakes:
-2,746.99; 5.600%; currently in deferment (Federal)
-33,269.31; 1.73-6.8% consolidated; currently in deferment (Federal)

I have been unemployed/underemployed for most of my time out of college. I started a new job in March. Since then, I have been putting whatever is left in my checking account when I next get paid toward the loans. However, it's making very little impact and I'm actually still getting further behind. After 3 months of doing this I've realized that no matter what, I'm going to default.

Now this leaves me with two options:

1) Continue splitting what little money I can put toward the loans between 4 loans, continue to get further behind, and eventually default on all 4

OR 2) Put all that money toward the 19k Navient loan. This way I would only default on 3 loans. It would improve my on-time payments percentage and help my credit by having another account marked pays as agreed. I plan on keeping this one current once it's caught up. 

I don't want to default at all but I just can't make the payments. It seems like I'm throwing money away if I'm just going to default anyway. It seems the choice is to default on 4 loans or save one and default on only 3. 

Neither of these is a good choice but I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation. Anyone else done this or any advice that might help me?

economy,Breaking free of debt slavery,"I am in debt, and that is a result of decisions I have made in the past. There is a two sided relationship between the lender and borrower. Some of my past decisions that brought me into debt have been irrational and others have been acts of desperation to support my family.

There is a viscous cycle where, as I enter into higher debt, I spend more money servicing debt. Also, the further in debt I am, the higher risk I am to the lender, so when cycling debt I am forced into higher interest. I understand the rational.

My question is about the legal framework between borrower and lender, and whether government could frame this better to help people get out of debt slavery.

1. I suggest any debt that is secured by an asset can be exited by simply passing ownership of that asset to the lender. The borrower cannot be pursued for money owing above and beyond value of asset.

2. There be placed a cap on the interest rate allowed for unsecured loans. Basically an unsecured loan is still secured to an individual. At no point is it rational for an individual to take on high interest debt, except in the case of an investment, in which case there will be a securable asset and the rule does not apply.

I would like to remove the incentive from lenders to bring people into debt slavery. If lenders ability to extract money from borrowers is limited, they will have less incentive to sell bad life decisions to people.

personalfinance,Stop Worrying About Your Credit Score. Good Credit STILL Isn't Difficult.,"Back in December I wrote [Let's get a grip - Good Credit Isn't Difficult](http://redd.it/2q3ba7).  Credit scores are *still* one the most oft-addressed topic in /r/personalfinance, and certainly the topic that people worry about most frivolously.  As a follow up, here are a few *more* simple truths you should keep in mind:

**Small swings are normal.**  Free credit scores through a credit card is probably the worst trend in banking right now, as it encourages people to get concerned when their score drops by 10 points.  You will never be able to tie a small drop to any one factor, but the common culprits are higher utilization or additional hard inquiries.  As long as you are paying off your bills in full, every month, just ignore it.

**Stop paying attention to Mint's recommendation to open more lines of credit.**  You don't need a ridiculous number of lines of credit to get a good credit score.  Good credit scores are primarily built through a long history of on time payments.  Mint (and other services like it) has a vested interest in pitching the services of their advertisers, some of which happen to be - shocker - credit card companies that want your business.

**Read the fine print.  Then read it again.**  Balance transfers to cards with a 0%-interest promotional period are useful tools to get out of debt... *if you actually get out of debt before the promotional period ends, **and** you make all the payments on time.*  Miss a payment and most of the time the promotional period ends immediately and you get charged for all the interest as if the promotional period never existed.  Tread lightly.

**Annualcreditreport.com is the only legitimate place to get your credit report.**  This is federal law.  You are entitled to one free credit report from each bureau each year.

**There are no quick ways to raise your credit score.**  If you ""need"" to increase your credit score quickly, you're SOL.  Rome was not built in a day, and neither is your credit score.

Finally, let's reiterate the most important point about using credit cards:

**Stop carrying credit card balances!**  There's simply no excuse for doing this, other than you buying things you can't afford.  Having a great credit score doesn't matter if you're being ruined by exorbitant credit card interest rates.  Always pay your credit card bill(s) in full, every month.

If you already have a great credit score that's awesome - keep doing what you're doing.  If you're working on improving your credit, that's good too.  Just don't let common sense fall by the wayside in your efforts.",finance,1434213457
personalfinance,Before Doing Anything...You Must Change Your Mindset,"I have followed this subreddit for a couple months now and have been able to take a lot of the lessons and start to implement all them into my life. 

However, this is more of a motivational post than anything. It's about how you have to change your mindset before you even set forth on these goals. 

I am someone who grew up in a household where my parents didn't always have the money to give us everything we wanted. My dad worked a profession that was very cyclical. When he was doing well, we did well. When we struggled, we struggled mightily. My parents were also really bad with money. They overspent when they didn't have money, double down on credit cards, and had no budget. Needless to say, I grew up in a household that was brought with stress and anxiety over money. 

That attitude sadly followed me through my life. When I had money, I would spend like a drunken sailor. When I had no money, I found myself stressed out to the point it would make me sick. It's all I could think about when I had no money. 

I always wanted to get on a plan or a budget to the point where I could feel comfortable and not worry about money. But, I always had some lame excuse why I couldn't do it. Excuses like ""Well it's hard to have a budget when you don't make any money"" or ""I'm a student, budgets don't apply to me"". Looking back, these were terrible excuses. 

Fast forward to today. I am currently in law school. The only sources of income I had was a part time library job which would pay me a couple hundred bucks a week. I was still having trouble making ends meet and I felt like every day was just another day of stress to deal with. 

Until I had a morning where I changed my mindset. 

One morning I had sat there and thought about what it would take to open my own firm after school. I looked at what the challenges were, and the number one being, you have to save money. So I started to think to myself, how do I save money to make this happen?

Well I wasn't making enough to save, so I started to think, what can I do to make money? The first thing I did was sign my car up for a car sharing service which rents out my car for about $45 a day. An hour after I signed up, I had my first request. Within 24 hours, my car was booked every weekend giving me a windfall of $500. All of this by simply renting out my car to people traveling to my city. 

After that, it just snowballed. I started to look at ways to save money on my monthly budgets. I switched gyms from one that was $80 a month to $10 a month. I cut back on cable and internet. I found a cheaper insurance plan for my car. I found out being a student on federal work study, you can actually qualify for help with money for food. It all started to add up because every dollar you save is another dollar earned. 

The point is, I had gone through my whole life fearing money. I feared bills, and when I was able to eek by and pay them, I felt a temporary sense of relief, only to feel the same buildup of stress a month later. 

This all changed when instead of fearing money, I took a whole different look at it. Instead of looking up to the skies and wishing for money to rain down on me, I started to actively figure out how to make more money. I already knew I had a baseline income and started to figure out how much I needed to do X, Y, and Z. Once I did that, the plans were set in motion. 

Tai Lopez once said he doesn't view money as dollars and cents, but as fuel units. He works to keep his fuel units full so he can go do the things he wants to do. When you start to view your life in the paradigm of what you want to do and how much ""fuel"" you need to do it, your mind starts to figure out ways to do it. You wouldn't embark on a 200 mile trip in a car with a quarter tank of gas. You have to fuel up. 

I don't have any special prescription for anyone should do money wise. I can't tell you if you do this specific thing, this result will happen. Everyone is different. In regards to the car sharing, I have a car that is high in demand and was able to turn what was a liability to an asset. You may have a liability that you can turn to an asset. Can you rent out your apartment? Can you freelance for somebody? Once you get the rush of extra cash, you don't want to stop. 

I have plans to build more little side revenues, but for now I feel like I'm headed in the right direction. Before even looking at all these plans for your personal finance, you have to switch your mindset from one where money is bad and hard to get, to one where money is good and easy to get if you set your mind to it. 

Money is a tool, your brain learns how to use tools. Teach your brain how to use money as a tool, and you'll be on your way to financial freedom.",finance,1434214364

personalfinance,"23, just graduated from college, $14/hr temp job, $30k student loans. What to do??","Hello, so I'm a fresh graduate that has their first job out of school at a state agency and currently lives on their own. The only problem is that the job I have is a temp job that pays only $14/hr. I currently live on my own, but I'm not really sure how to handle my expenses (I've only been doing this officially for 2 weeks) and I'm kinda freaking out about how to handle my money so I can stay on top of things but also enjoy myself.

**Monthly Expenses:** 

Rent - $345 (includes internet)

Utilities - $25 to $50

Food + Misc Expenses- $300 (I don't eat out very much b/c I prefer to cook)

Gas - $150 (Live w/i 3 mi of work. Factoring in gas expenses to see my boyfriend who lives 2.5 hours away)

So this is pretty much it in terms of fixed expenses right now. I'm still on my parents phone plan and my car is completely paid off thanks to them. However, my parents told me I'm going to have to start paying insurance after 6 months and that it would cost $200/month.

**Loans:** 

Private Loan - $5,000

Federal Loan - $25,000

I make ~$14/hr and work 40 hour weeks. I only just started and haven't even received my first paycheck, so I have no clue what my monthly take home is going to look like. I did some rough math and I think it should be somewhere between $2,000 - $2,200 after taxes.

**Main Question:** How should I be planning my budget? How much should be allocated towards things like emergency savings? How much should I be allocated towards my loans? My job already has a retirement program and a union that I plan to enroll in both.",finance,1434222952

personalfinance,"19 and considering investing in a Roth IRA, advice?","I'm nineteen years old. A few weeks ago I reached a lawsuit settlement in excess of $50,000. I don't know a lot about finance but I know I need to prepare for my future if I want to avoid ending up like my parents. It has come to my attention that leaving $50,000 in a savings account with a near zero interest rate is not the most practical thing for me to do with that money. After looking into it a bit, I am considering investing at least some of my money into a Roth IRA to begin saving for retirement. 


I have some questions that I was hoping you guys could answer because it's all a bit confusing to me. 


General financial info about me so you can better answer my questions:  
1. Debt free.  
2. Unemployed since April. (had cash-paying ""jobs"" since then such as babysitting, house-sitting, etc)  
3. Made over $5,500 (Roth maximum annual contribution, if I'm not mistaken?) in 2014.  
4. Not currently in college, but I do want to further my education.  
5. Parents are broke, not financially savvy, etc.   


And here are my questions:

1. From what I understand, Roth IRAs require contributions to be earned income, so I wouldn't be able to directly use my settlement funds, correct? I would need to earn $5,500 a year to be able to put in the maximum annual contribution, correct?

2. After considering question one, if what I assume is correct, then how would I go about adding funds in? I made over $5,500 last year, but in 2015 I've only made about $3000 in earned income.
When contributing to my Roth IRA in 2015, would I use my earned income from last year, or my current earned income from this year?

3. I am considering using Vanguard for my Roth IRA, any comments/concerns?

4. When you first open your IRA, can you contribute more than $5,500 to begin, or is there still a $5,500 limit? If there is a limit, do you have any suggestions on what to do with the other $45,000? (Serious suggestions please, I don't really want to ""travel the world and do sketchy drugs with strangers"", ""buy a super expensive car"", ""go to the casino"", etc.)

5. Seeing as how the settlement was for a medical issue, it is possible that I will have a decent amount of medical expenses in the future. This being the case, it is within the realm of possibility that money would have to be taken out of the Roth IRA. From what I understand, I can take my contributed funds out of the Roth IRA at anytime penalty/tax-free, but not anything I've earned through the Roth IRA itself. Is this correct?

6. If what I assume about question 5 is correct, what kind of penalties/taxes would there be on the money made through the Roth IRA?

7. Is there a program that can help me visualize my finances and get them in order? I see some Redditors in PF and FI that seem to be using a similar program that looks pretty simple and informative. Could anyone tell me what that program is?

8. Do you have any other advice, comments, concerns, links to articles, etc?


Thanks a bunch for reading this and helping me out, the entire financial world seems a bit overwhelming to me but I know I have to learn now. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks :)",finance,1434226036

personalfinance,Question about loans and repayment timelines.,"Due dates for things like student loans, including through myfedloan.org often fall on weekends. This happened to me and I was required to submit the payment on either the Monday after or the previous Friday. 

My question is- is submitting a weekend payment on the following Monday considered delinquency? The site's FAQ seemed a bit contradictory. 

From the [online payment FAQ](http://www.myfedloan.org/help-center/faq/online-payments-faq.shtml)- 

""Can I schedule an online payment on a weekend?

No. Although you can pay online 24/7, you can schedule payments only Monday through Friday. So if your due date is on a Saturday or Sunday you must schedule the payment on the Friday before or the Monday after.""

And from the [direct debit FAQ](http://www.myfedloan.org/help-center/faq/direct-debit-faq.shtml)-

""What if my due date falls on a weekend or holiday?

NOTE: We do not complete payment transactions on weekends or holidays. Payments for due dates falling on these days are submitted the business day before the due date. Most financial institutions will process your payment on the business day after the weekend/holiday; however, some may process your payment during the weekend/holiday. Refer to them for further information.
-
Example for Weekend Due Date:

Friday—We submit your payment for processing for your Saturday due date.

Saturday—Due date

Monday—Your financial institution processes your payment
-
Example for Holiday Due Date:

Friday—We submit your payment for processing for your Monday due date which falls on a holiday.

Monday—Due date

Tuesday—Your financial institution processes your payment""



I assume the second part only refers to direct payment withdrawal, and the prior to repaying loans in general. I realize /r/personalfinance is more for advice, but what are your general thoughts and ideas?

politics,How TISA - the secret Trade in Services Agreement could lead to the WTO telling the US to get rid of its minimum wage laws!,"TISA stands for trade in Services Agreement.


TISA has been in negotiations since 2006 by a group called ""friends of Services"" and later ""really Good friends of Services"". 

its designed to be merged into the WTO GATS agreement, the very same agreement that was responsible for the repeal of the Glass Steagall Act in 1999, and issues with the blocking of affordable health care in the US. 

the WTO services agreement is truly the gift that keeps giving. In the late 1990s, the WTO used the same agreement to justify requiring El Salvador to forgo increasing its minimum wage to 60 cents an hour, from 36 cents an hour based on the argument that having such a high minimum wage would serve as a market entry barrier to foreign firms entitled to enter the El Salvador market by GATS.

the same thing could happen to the US if it is seen to be raising the minimum wage to prevent foreign services firms from entering the market.  this is one of the dangers of trade agreements, they give organizations like the WTO huge amounts of power, and they turn the goals upside down.  lets use the minimum wage and incomes as an example. 

TISA forces the privatization of a large chunk of the public sector, federal, state and local/municipal, (using the GATS rules) and then puts it out for bidding in a global procurement system. 

(For a discussion of the broad scope of these rules, see http://www.ciel.org/Publications/PublicServicesScope.pdf )

How are these workplaces privatized and the work put up for international bidding?  Via the WTO's GPA, (General Procurement Agreement)  

Of course, the companies that win those contracts have to have workers,. Will they be allowed to bring them along? I think its likely that the Movement of natural persons portion of TISA does exactly that. 

[See the discussion of TISA here.](http://www.cuts-geneva.org/pacteac/images/Documents/EAC%20Forum/Forum17/EAC%20Geneva%20Forum-%20WTO%20Note%2017.pdf) 

Without TISA - they might still have a legal right to do the work under GATS- (TISA is considered to be a bridge to GATS)  but paying local wage structures might be seen as ""more burdensome than necessary"" and the WTO could declare that to be a barrier to trade as they did with El Salvador.  **They could do this if it was seen to be an intentional or not ""[technical barrier to trade](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tbt_e/tbt_info_e.htm), eliminating their natural ""competitive advantage"", low cost.** 

**If a company is the low bidder, they are entitled to do the job. the idea is to lower costs (wages) by encouraging global competition.**

Since these contracts [are the long promised payoff for globalization](https://www.princeton.edu/~pcglobal/conferences/wtoreform/Betts_Nicolaides_memo.pdf), putting any obstacle in their path (like requiring them to pay a local minimum wage or especially, raising a minimum wage) that would be considered to be wrong by the WTO, and could quite possibly result in the WTO demanding the elimination of that ""technical barrier to entry"". 

As the WTO did in the 1990s with El Salvador. (Likely with the US's encouragement)

Recently, some family property was sold and around $80,000 was deposited in it. As we saw with his brother who passed a few years ago (who kept his trust a secret from his family), all the money was dissolved back into the larger family trust that is controlled by the oldest brother who hates everyone in the family. My father is worried that when he passes the money will not accessible to me unless I am named as a beneficiary.

I am currently attending a private university that is covered by about 50% academic scholarship, 25% need based grants, and I am taking out the remaining $8k in federal loans each year. As much as I'd like to pull out whatever I need to pay my loans and the remaining cost of my education, there are extenuating family circumstances that require the money be left in his trust before he passes.

My worry is, that if I get named as a beneficiary, I will have to report it as some form of income, which will severely fuck with my FAFSA and expected family contribution and I will lose most, if not all, of my federal aid. 

What is the best way to go about making sure I have access to the money when he passes with the least amount of tax implications as possible? My father has had multiple strokes and is not in full mental capacity, so I have been tasked with helping him get this sorted out before it is too late.

crypto,What to do about institutional TLS interception?,"I recently had a conversation in Freenode's #crypto channel about the TLS interception done at a federal trade school I'm a student at known as Job Corps. I'm pasting the log here, but the tl;dr is that

* The Job Corps network is sslstripped, and then new certs are generated dynamically
* Other then by the student's own means (I'm tethering my phone, for example), their only access to the internet is through Job Corps computers, which is federal property (young adults come here to learn a trade because they can't find work otherwise, making it all the more significant)
* The [Privacy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act_of_1974#Access_to_records) may apply.
* It was suggested that I might wanna call [The United States Attorney General of the Department of Labor](http://www.oig.dol.gov/hotlinecontact.htm)

Here are the irc logs.
    
    [09:10] &lt;atgnag__&gt; By the way, when I'm on an institutional computer, is there any way to get around this? http://veuwer.com/2l73.png
    [09:11] &lt;atgnag__&gt; As you can see, in this case, google has been sslstripped, and then re-encrypted with a different certificate.

    [09:16] &lt;woggle&gt; Given that you don't control the machine, there's not a good way.
    [09:16] &lt;woggle&gt; If the interception is happening in the network, even not trusting the intercepting CA (which presumably added to the system cert store) won't help much because you a direct connection to google will still get you something signed by that CA.
    [09:19] &lt;hlieberman&gt; Portable Firefox might at least help you get the CA warning.
    [09:20] &lt;woggle&gt; And I wouldn't call this 'sslstripped', that's usually a term for making the connection HTTP to you.
    [09:20] &lt;hlieberman&gt; Since Firefox distrusts the system CA list by default.

    [09:20] &lt;hlieberman&gt; At least on Linux.  Don't know about other OSs, actually.
    [09:20] &lt;atgnag__&gt; woggle: What term should I use then? sslstripping certainly seems like part of the process.
    [09:21] &lt;woggle&gt; Uh, there's probably a shorter term than 'TLS interception proxy'....
    [09:21] == telex [teletype@freeshell.de] has joined ##crypto
    [09:21] &lt;hlieberman&gt; You could say ""intercepted"" and have that context be clear
    [09:22] &lt;hlieberman&gt; Bonus points for the subtext that information was revealed.
    [09:22] &lt;Amun_Ra&gt; atgnag__: you could use ssl tunnel if you can
    [09:23] &lt;SuppliedRelic&gt; TLS tunnel preferably
    [09:24] &lt;atgnag__&gt; Well... I can't really install any software, so...
    [09:24] &lt;woggle&gt; atgnag__: Given that it's not your machine, there's little you can do that wouldn't be be in serious violation of policy (or law).

    [09:34] &lt;woggle&gt; They didn't set this up by accident.
    [09:34] &lt;atgnag__&gt; I mean, I'm at a trade school... so for many people this is their only access to the internet.
    [09:35] &lt;atgnag__&gt; Maybe it should be brought up to the student government then, if I can explain it to them.
    [09:35] &lt;atgnag__&gt; (Not that they have any executive power)
    [09:36] &lt;woggle&gt; They do not let you bring your own devices and use the internet through them?
    [09:36] &lt;atgnag__&gt; We are allowed, but not everyone can.
    [09:36] &lt;woggle&gt; If they're not intercepting on your own devices, that's... interesting.
    [09:37] &lt;woggle&gt; May suggest the interception is a local proxy setting instead of the usual ""transparent"" proxy.
    [09:37] &lt;atgnag__&gt; (They don't provide wifi, I'm accessing the internet by tethering from my phone.)
    [09:38] &lt;woggle&gt; Oh, that's not what I meant.
    [09:38] &lt;woggle&gt; I was asking they provided some way of connecting your own device through their internet connection, wifi or otherwise.
    [09:38] &lt;atgnag__&gt; No.
    [09:38] &lt;woggle&gt; (It's not unheard of to provide semi-public ethernet hookups...)
    [09:39] &lt;atgnag__&gt; For anyone that can't afford to bring personal devices, their only access to the internet is through the Student Learning Center.
    [09:39] &lt;atgnag__&gt; That might be a lot, since this a federally paid for program.
    [09:40] &lt;atgnag__&gt; People come here because they can't get jobs.
    [09:42] &lt;hlieberman&gt; US federally paid for?

    [09:43] &lt;hlieberman&gt; Or US federally run?
    [09:45] &lt;woggle&gt; The name on the cert looks like actually part of the Dept of Labor and not even contracted out.
    [09:45] &lt;woggle&gt; Which probably changes things, really.
    [09:45] &lt;atgnag__&gt; hlieberman: Both. It's called Job Corps. Look it up.
    [09:45] &lt;hlieberman&gt; Yes, that changes things a lot.
    [09:46] &lt;woggle&gt; I was thinking about FERPA issues, but being an actual US gov't agency imposes a whole bunch of other requirements.
    [09:46] &lt;atgnag__&gt; Which means if I tried to change something on their computers, I'd be charged with something something government property.

personalfinance,(UK) Can someone help me clear my debts? I really don't know what to do and it's making me feel ill.,"Hi. A little background..

I'm in a poor relationship that looks like it's starting to fizzle out. That's not the problem but the issue is I currently have roughly £8,500 in credit card debt with stupid interest rates, that I'm never going to pay off. The irony of this is that some of it is debt from my wedding last year. 

I really need help and don't know what the best course of action to take is. My credit score is poor and I've been refused credit elsewhere. I just tried an online loan app with my bank and it was refused because I have a low score. I feel like I'm a slave to the people I owe money to and I don't know where to turn. This debt is a major stumbling block to sorting my life out. If anyone could give me any tips/advise on how to deal with this and make it manageable I'd appreciate it. I earn a fairly good wage, (take home about £1500 a month). I want to get all my debts in one place and pay them off at a sensible rate of interest but I don't know how to do it without getting shafted further.

personalfinance,Taking out a loan form my parents' HELOC - Taxes Question,"Hey PF,

I am taking out a loan through my mothers HELOC (to help pay for grad school) since the interest rate is near 4%, and any student loan I can get is 6-7%. 

Details:

Loan Amount: 28k

Loan Interest Rate: ~4%

I will be paying the entire loan, as well as interest every month, to my mother. I plan on paying it off over 5-10 years maximum, sooner if possible. 

My question: for tax purposes, can I claim this loan and the interest rate as student interest? Or is that impossible since it is through her HELOC?

Thanks, if you guys need more info let me know!",finance,1434307317
financialindependence,Hi friends. Looking for some advice.,"So I am a recent college grad with a decently paying first job (around 35K). I was not only fortunate enough to graduate debt free, but I also just found out that my grandfather has had a savings account for me since I was born that has around 45K in it as of now. 

I'm meeting with my grandfather and his broker this week to get briefed on everything and start talking about what I want to do with it. 

So I was just wondering what kind of questions I should be prepared to ask, and what I should do with the money. I want to keep most of it invested, but would it make sense to take out 5-10K to help get on my feet? 

Thanks!",finance,1434307601
personalfinance,How should my husband and I do with a gift of 20k?,"(X-posted from r/financialplanning as was suggested there!)

My husband and I got married last October and we have a baby on the way, due this October. I was lucky enough to graduate college debt-free, but my husband was less fortunate with his family resources and still has about 20k to pay off in student loans. He defaulted on his loan at one point several years ago, but got on a rehab plan and this was very recently scrubbed from his history. My parents have just incredibly, amazingly, and generously offered to pay off this remaining student loan balance and thus fast forward our goal of becoming homeowners by at least a few years. Really they will just give us the money to use it how we think best, so here I am, asking for your advice on how best to spend it given our current financial situation.

Some more background on us, since I'm not really sure what's relevant: I'm 29, he's 35, we're both employed full time and earn a combined total of $78,500 a year before taxes and bonuses. We live in Seattle so housing costs are high, but we've got a really nice spot that works for us and baby at 1.5k a month, which believe it or not is a crazy deal for Seattle proper. Current savings are 10k. My credit scores are in the high 600s &amp; low 700s, his are in the mid 600s. His will go up quite a bit once we close the 5 small accounts he has in collections (don't get me started) and file disputes for those. His credit utilization is 55%, mine is 42%. He has more total accounts open and a better average account age, so once he adds me onto his accounts as I added him onto mine, my score should go up as well.

Current debt that is accruing interest:

1) Husband's student loan, 19.9 k, interest rate 2.88% (all his). $188 monthly payment.

2) Credit card debt is 5k + 6.5k at 10 and 12%, 1k at 20%, 3k at 0% for the next 18 months. This is shared between us except for the 1k, which is in my name only. Monthly payments vary depending on what we're able to do but at minimum we pay $200 on each of the big ones and a little less on the smaller ones.

3) New auto loan, about 14k at 3.89% (in my name only). Monthly payment is $260.

So: where is this money best utilized? Our priorities are: maximizing our ability to save each month, reducing the # of bills paid each month both for quality of life reasons and lowering the risk of forgetting to pay one of them, and raising our credit scores. There may also be other priorities that we haven't thought of. r/personalfinance, please help!

Many thanks :)

*Edit: To forestall further recommendations re: an emergency fund, we are lucky enough to have close &amp; generous family members who will support us in the event of job loss, illness, etc. We realize that this is not the case for most and feel very fortunate. So establishing an emergency fund beyond the 10k we have in savings is not a priority at this time.

The total cost of the house is $116,000, I'm putting down 20% on the house which leaves me borrowing roughly 92,800. The interest rate is 3.5%, which seems very low to me. I've calculated the closing costs and appraisal costs etc. The bank says I will end up paying them roughly $119.414. I've used loan calculators online and it says I'll end up paying them around 140k, are they lying and trying to fuck me over? It is a 15 year loan.

Now here is my question If you did $119,414-$92,800 that equals 27,914. Now if I theoretically paid of the mortgage in 7.5 years, doesn't that mean the bank would only make (27,914/2)? So they total I would pay is $106,757. I will not be penalized for paying more early. I've already checked on that. Sorry if this seems like a dumb question but I'm curious because it looks like I may be living with 4 of my cousins and could in theory charge a reasonable amount of rent to everyone and make double payments monthly (assuming they live with me for 7.5 years).

personalfinance,Just found out after months of work on buying a house that I got approved for the main loan but not the DPA loan. Have a week at most to come up with the down payment.,"So on top of that which was in the title let me explain my situation.( fair warning I am on mobile)

I started off early March looking for a house to buy with a CHFA loan with down payment assistance. The reason I started looking was my mother's wonderful landlord dropped off the face of the earth, never paid his mortgage and caused her house to go into foreclosure (lived there for 15 years) while he was collecting a overpriced amount of rent for a run down property. I have been working non stop for 5 years at my current job and had some money saved up when I found out what happened ( I was living with my girlfriend at the time ). 

Now I find a house that has enough room for me and the gf, as well as my mom and sister. Go through the paperwork send stuff back and forth. Have to pay more and more random fees which I was expecting. Now we had to wait for fha to approve the loan, I was told that everything looked fine time and time again. 

Now comes to yesterday I find out that the loan company approved the loan for the house but not the down payment assistance which covered closing costs and the 3.5% down payment. 

The old house has been in foreclosure for a while and were down to the last week and its getting to the point where we are scared of getting locked out ( I moved back in to help ).

Now my mortgage broker wants 3.5% (6000$) and closing costs (9000$). I was told that closing costs can be covered by raising my interest rate from 3.0% to around 5.25%.

Now I have to try to get all the money from my 401k and savings just to attempt to get the down payment...what do I do. Sorry for the long post

personalfinance,"I want to be debt free and save some money, is this plan the right idea?","Hello PF,
 
I have a few questions I am hoping someone much more knowledgeable than me can assist with.
 
I am currently have an ""accelerated"" pay schedule (paying every two weeks) with my mortgage company Wells Fargo going and as it stands will be paying off my home loan in 22 years instead of 30. As of right now I have a car loan with around 3400 left on it, a home improvement ""loan"" that was given through a special interest credit card around 3100 and a actual home loan around 3100. The interest rates for these loans are 16%, 9% and 16% respectively. They all have around 2 and 1/2 years left on them. In addition I have a 401K loan of around 1300 for a unexpected home repair as well. my 401K allows 1 loan at a onetime interest charge of 3%.
I also have two credit cards a Chase Freedom and a Capitol one Quicksilver. The freedom card has a 0 balance and 6 months left of 0%, and the Quicksilver has a current 1500 balance and is my monthly use card that gets paid off in full. I have around 8 months left of 0% interest.
 
I would like to pay off each of these loans and refi my house down to a 15 year loan while continuing my accelerated pay schedule of 1/2 every two weeks. To this end I have been working a TON of overtime (no day off in last two months) and within the next 2-3 months should be able to pay off everything besides the home loan of course.
 
Here is the plan I have in mind and I would like to not only get a second opinion on if this is a smart plan but if it would negatively impact my planned refi in any way. My credit score is currently around 700 if it matters.
 
I currently have around 2600 in my bank account. The plan is as follows.
 
1) Pay off 401k loan of around 1300. This will leave 900 in the account after remaining monthly expenses.
 
2) Take out another 401K loan of around 4000 to payoff car loan. Put remaining money in bank account.
 
3) Payoff car loan, after remaining paychecks in month will have around 3600 in bank account @ EOM.
 
4) Payoff home improvement credit card of around 3100. This will leave around 500 in bank account
 
5) The non-credit card home loan allows me to make payments with my credit cards. Payoff Home loan of 3100 with Chase Freedom Card (3500 max balance).
 
So around 7/1/15 I will have around 500 in the bank account, a chase freedom balance of 3100 @ 0%, and my quicksilver balance of currently 1500 or so also at 0%. I was looking to pay off the quicksilver as normal around mid-July (and each month going forward), and make a payment of around 1000 towards the freedom card by end of July.
In august I was looking at making a payment on the Freedom balance of around 1500 and finally paying it completely off in September.
 
7) Refinance home in October.
 
8) ???

9) Profit

From what I currently understand this will save me the most money long term, especially as I turn those monthly payments towards paying off the credit card balance.
 
At this point I can have around 60-100 taken out of my paycheck every two weeks 120-200 going towards the 401K (automatically) and spend the next 3-4 months saving up a emergency fund or putting all the money over the next 3-4 months into the 401K loan to pay it off. If it wasn’t clear I get a one-time interest charge of 3% of the balance that gets paid back into the 401k loan so the total cost of taking it (other than having less money to invest towards retirement) will be 120 on top so a total repayment of 4120 if I take 4k out.

At this point it seems to be easy but for this simple reason I am wondering if I am missing something. In addition I am curious to see how much paying down these balances would help my score or how much nearly maxing out a card could hurt it.",finance,1434319654
personalfinance,Using Parental Home Equity on a MD Student Loan,"Hey everyone, 

I’ve just been told about this interesting conundrum and I’m a little curious about everyone’s take on this situation. A friend of mine is thinking of having her parents take a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to cover her medical student loans and was wondering about the pros and the cons of this idea. From this discussion and a bit of searching, I thought of a few things and was wondering if anyone else can elaborate upon them. 

For some background information, she has just graduated from med school and will be a resident of a hospital and will make around $60k while living at home in the state of California. She has around 250k in debt and likely around 6-7% in interest on that debt per combination of mostly private loans. Job security is high, but income as a resident will likely go from 60 to at most 70 in the next 3 to 4 years. 

The current thought process is to have her parents apply for an equity loan or a HELOC which has a lower interest rate than the student loans. From a few quotes, they noted that the loan (unfortunately she could not specify which type) is around 3.3% or so (I’m using http://www.bankrate.com/finance/home-equity/rate-roundup.aspx ) as the basis, so I’m not sure how she was able to find something that low unless it was possibly a teaser intro on a variable rate. 

In any case, the lower interest rate from the house loan should theoretically be 1 to 2 percent lower than the current student loan—translating to thousands of dollars saved. From her perspective, the loan would be secured by her parents, so technically no downsides to her; however, I think she has a great relationship with her parents so I wouldn’t put much thought on that. 

I’m now curious on the whole process of taking out a home loan. Are there normally any closing costs or other additional fees that are not usually shown? House appraisal fees by the bank? 

What is the tax rate for the Home Equity/HELOC? Likely the lower rate is a variable one, so a fixed interest is closer to 4-5%. Would that 1-2% different in interest be justified (2.5 to 5k I estimate)? 

What are the tax implications? I thought you could deduct without itemized deduction on the interest of the student loan (up to $2,500). For her parents, I was wondering if a gift tax might be affected in this calculation—they aren’t paying the school tuition, just the loans. However, would there be a net benefit for her parents if they did an itemized deduction? 

The equity loans are secured versus unsecured student loans, if anything happens and she was not able to pay the bill, the house may get foreclosed. However, at the same time, you can declare bankruptcy vs. having that student loan stick with you. One thing is that she cannot use Income Base Repayment or PLSF, at the same time; I don’t think that these are that big of a concern for a medical resident. 

The major item that I am not comfortable with this idea is using her parent’s home loan when they are approaching retirement age. 

Nevertheless quick summary of questions: Any tax implications for both her and her parents? Is there any justification for or against taking the loan?",finance,1434319935

personalfinance,"Lost my job, lots of debt. I think I have some options, but not sure what's best.","I posted a few days ago but didn't get much of a response. Hoping for better luck this time. 

I've got myself in a mess and I'm not sure what route I should take, I'm hopeful someone can help. 
Due to downsizing I've recently lost my job of 7 years resulting in a 60K annual pay cut for our household. I've been looking for 2 months but have yet to find something new. 
I've currently got about 22K in cc debt, behind at least a month on all the payments with interest rates ranging from 8 all the way up to 19%.  (I know, I'm and idiot).  I've also got some medical bills from having a baby last year, approx 8K after my insurance paid its share. 
I've consulted a BK attorney and would qualify for Chapter 13 if I choose to do so. My understanding is that going this route will require me to repay the unsecured debt at 0% over 5 years, my car will go away but I can keep my home. The attorney also said that the medical bills would probably just go away because they would ""not participate"" since they've gotten most of their money from insurance. 

I've recently started getting a bunch of stuff in the mail from mystery companies (there's no real names on the letters just loan offers and phone numbers) offering to help reduced the debt and repay at a reduced rate, most say approx 4 - 6%.  I've not yet contacted any of them. 

I have some savings available and could potentially pay off a large majority of the cc debt IF I were able to settle with them for a lower dollar amount. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice. Im pretty sure I'll still have to file for BK because of the car and medical bills but if I could get rid of a lot of that cc debt on my own, before filing, obviously it would lower the amount I have to pay back over the 5 years.  
Are these letters legit? Should I call and try to take advantage of them, or can I just call and try to settle with the cc companies myself?  Is there something in particular I should say or do to get a better settlement?
Any advice would be appreciated. If I haven't given enough info let me know, my brain is fried, I'm sure I've missed something...",finance,1434326229
personalfinance,Implications of canceling just-activated Capital One Quicksilver One?,"Recently found out Capital One partnered with Peet's in my location and offers half-off coffee for using their credit card.  After reading about the Quicksilver card (no fee) I applied, though mistakenly to the Quicksilver One ($39 annual fee).

When the new card came and I went to activate it I saw I had another card pending activation -- a few years ago I'd responded to a Platinum offer and got some dumb $300 card -- but went ahead and activated the new one.  Then I had a thought, so called and they were able to upgrade the older to a Quicksilver (not One) and lower its interest rate.

They won't combine the balances for some silly reason and instead had me apply for a credit line increase on the older card.  My thought was to cancel the Quicksilver One once I have the Quicksilver, so as to avoid having new credit and keep my average account age high.  But as it's already been activated, has any damage already been done and I need to just keep it now?  Any knowledge on whether Capital One will bother reporting a never-used, brand-new, canceled card?  The Quicksilver One does have 0% for almost a year, so that's something too.",finance,1434327578

Between us, we already have one credit card: the Capital One platinum card. Very basic, no rewards. We got it to build his credit. And it appears to have worked. 

Anyway, I had lunch with my aunt today and she mentioned using her points to travel to Europe later this year. It got me intrigued. My aunt travels very frequently for business and is able to use her points to get free hotel rooms and flights. Now my aunt also makes a lot more money than my fiancé and me. 

Combined, we probably make between $40 and $45k a year. But we live in Georgia and we are pretty good about living under our means. 

We have been good about paying off the Capital One credit card in full every month. And the only other debt we have is my car loan (Around $8,500 left on the loan. Should be paid off in September 2018.) and my federal student loans (owe about $40k on that and it's in good standing, never been late or missed a payment.)

So we both have good potential to increase our incomes significantly sometime in the next five years or so.

With all that said....wow, I did not mean to type that much but I wanted to give relevant info. Anyway, would it be smart to apply for a travel rewards credit card? I used to think that travel cards were usually meant for people with high income. But now I'm not sure. 

I've never really traveled anywhere except Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee. I would love to see the rest of the country. But I'm willing to start small. Plus I have a hearing and ear drum problem that may make it difficult to travel to places like Europe lol.

Maybe this time, it's passive investing. Investors have poured money in passive funds, taking on the good with the bad, convinced that they can weather any storm to win the investment game.

I can't find that site anymore, but I'd like to get people's opinions on this if my school will allow me to do this.

I did ask them to clarify if there were any additional fees doing it this way (if it's the same % origination fee, it doesn't matter.. if it is a flat fee, consolidating into as few disbursements as possible will need to be factored in against the interest that would accrue), if I am limited on how many times I can get money disbursed, if there is a minimum I can request, etc.

Any thoughts? In theory, if a school gave you annual disbursements (not sure if most/all do semester disbursements or not), and tuition divided monthly plus cost of living was somewhere around 5k at what I believe to be the average fed loan interest rate of ~6.3% (5.8 + 6.8/2), you'd save $315 of interest just within the first month of delaying that month's loan money.

The Situation:  
I’m considering moving out of my condo that I purchased in 2012. Since, I met my future wife and we’re beginning to talk about options. The ideal situation is to move out of the city within a year or two. Instead of selling the condo and buying a new home, it was casually recommended that I rent out the condo. However, I don’t have the money in hand for the down payment for a new home. Therefore, is there a method of taking out some of the equity of my existing property to cover the down payment on a new home (HELOC, cash out refi, or ???)? The rental market in my city is very aggressive which is why this is so appealing to me. However, the home owners market is equally aggressive which makes me reluctant.
  
The Options:  
1. Rent the condo out and buy a new home with ???  
2. Sell the condo and buy a new home  
  
The Numbers:  
1. Outstanding mortgage amount: $169,574.10  
2. Purchased amount (in 2012): $184,900.00  
3. Monthly mortgage amount: $984.35  
4. Monthly HOA dues: $232.36  
5. Mortgage interest rate: 3.75% (no PMI)  
6. Possible monthly rental income: $1,700  
7. Zestimate resale value: $243,189.00  
(Additionally, it might be worth noting that a unit was sold in my building for an even $250k that was a 100 sq. ft. less than my unit but with a view.)

Can anyone recommend if pulling equity from a condo to purchase a second home is possible or wise for the purpose of capitalizing on the aggressive rental opportunity in my area?

Current situation is this: I'm 28, unmarried, but live with a partner who contributes rent money, and make just under 40k a year.

I'm looking to refinance for the first time. I've been talking with the bank that currently holds my mortgage, as well as my checking and savings accounts. I've been with them for several years. Here is what they are offering me: A 4.5% fixed interest rate on a new conventional 30 year loan. The goal is to eliminate my PMI and lower my mortgage payment. The house has gained some value, and the bank tells me that if it appraises ($450 fee) at 145k, the 4k in closing costs can be rolled into the new loan. If it appraises at $140k, I will have to pay the closing costs out of pocket to still eliminate the PMI. This puts my new monthly payment at around $770.

I should mention that I have excellent credit, and when the bank pulled it for this new loan application the three scores were around 790. I just got off the phone with USAA to see if they could do any better, but they are currently not offering mortgage refinancing, and transferred me to US Bank instead, who offered me very similar numbers as my bank.

In general I have serious difficulty getting/keeping jobs.  I have multiple-years-long gaps in my resume despite my best efforts.  I have a degree in computer science but generally I'm too lazy and undisciplined to actually program anything of significance.  I'm pretty much a weirdo reject of society, probably have aspergers or something.  Nobody wants to hire me: I'm an obese black guy with terrible skin, allergic to everything, an off-putting speech impediment, and little social/conversational skills; not stuff I can collect disability for.  Right now I have a minimum-wage job that I'm going to lose in a few months but I'm a single frugal person with few expenses so it has been covering me.  I live off about 15k a year.  No significant debt.  In the past I have survived by depending on abusive, cluster-B-personality-disordered family members and S.O.s.  I am 47 years old and I'm just getting older, uglier, and less employable.  I have tasted too much freedom and independance, living by myself now so I'll never go back to depending on anyone else again.


Anyway, so this money is just sitting in a savings account with a low interest rate.  How do I invest this money so I can get the best interest rate and stretch it out the most while I look for a new job, which in my experience, takes years to do?

thanks.",finance,1434388068

Being offered a 60k/year job (5 days a week) as a 1099 independent contractor (but essentially still treated as an employee). Neither job offers benefits. Just graduated grad school in December. 

1) I know that 1099 means SE tax, how can I mitigate that as a 1099 IC?

2) The new job would allow me to network with more people in my field and allow me to learn more than my current job in which I don't interact with other professionals. 

3) I have 108k in student loan debt, all federal mainly unsub. I live at home with family, no car payment, no bills besides cell phone (50/mo), car insurance (92/mo), gas (400/mo - a lot of driving).

4) The current job is very easy and low stress. I do have a small commission incentive, however to get the same numbers as the other job I would have to be working much harder. 

5) The new job has potential for some upward mobility as 60k (5k/mo) is the starting salary. 

6) Do I still come out ahead taking the new job?",finance,1434389011
personalfinance,"Moving soon, need advice on how to do it for cheap!","Hi all, 

The husband just got an awesome federal job about 4 hours away from where we currently live. This requires us to break our lease at our current apartment complex (they're trying to make us pay 2 months rent, along with giving a 60 day notice wtf). 
He starts mid-July. We found an apartment in that area that we can move into at the end of July (he'll be staying with a friend for free until then). 

During our last move, we got a uhual and did the move completely by ourselves. I ended up injuring my knee in the process (since we were carrying our shit up 4 flights) and don't really want to endure that again. We don't have any friends we can rely on in the area or else I'd make them help. 

So basically how can we do this the most cost effectively? We're about to be paying out of our asses just to get out of this damn lease so I'm trying to make this move as smooth as possible.

(first reddit post woo!) 

I tried to find the answer to my question in the thread but didn't find something specific to what I'm looking for. I am entering med school in NC with a tuition of about $25,000. I have been offered financial aid at $40,500 in Federal Direct loans and then another $15,212 in the Grad PLUS loan, and $2,000 in scholarship. This is all to cover their estimated $57,000 cost of attendance. This seemed a bit high to me, and I did a budget based on estimated costs and came out with a need of about $40,000.  

Now, thanks to my wonderful parents, I have access to $44,000 in an NC529 education account that I can use. And I may have access to $23,000 in an account for a sibling that won't be used. I'm trying to figure out how much federal loan to use and how much of the 529 account to use this year. I need to reduce my financial aid award in the next few weeks. Would it make more sense to leave a little more in the account and let it grow? Should it be about half and half? I know that I should avoid having to use the grad PLUS loan. 

Should I talk to a financial adviser? 

Thank you for reading if you did :)

gaming,How Cave Story Should Have Ended (A Ridiculously Epic Fanfic Featuring Kekfa's Death Scene From Final Fantasy Dissidia),"As Quote dished out the final blow to the Undead Core, the thing suddenly stopped moving and collapsed onto the ground. It was still alive, but just barely.

""Should I shoot him now, or wait till we get home?"" Quote asked. ""Personally, I prefer the latter.""

""No, wait!"" Sue responded, waving her hands in front of Quote's face to deliver the important 'no-no' message she was clearly going for. ""Let's hear what he has to say. PLEASE? He used to be one of my friends!"" she got down on her knees and begged.

""Well, alright, but this better not be like that time when I found Kazuma's cockroach in my gluteus fracture."" Quote replied, shrugging and rolling his eyes at his own remark.

Sue shrugged, groaned and rolled her own eyes in return, before turning back around to face what little was left of the Doctor's seemingly heartless soul.

""It's NOT ENOUGH..."" the Doctor growled menacingly, despite being basically already dead. ""ENSLAVE MORE...HAVE GOT TO ENSLAVE MORE!!""

""For fuck's sake, just stop it!"" Sue yelled at him, clenching her fists in rage. ""This is such utterly senseless and racist violence and hatred towards our Mimiga people, and it must be stopped right this instant!""

The Doctor, chuckling gleefully at that remark, continued his monologue. ""Violence isn't SUPPOSED to make sense, you inferior-intelligence buffoon! It's only FUN when it's senseless, my dear!""

""Why continue fighting, when you know deep down inside of your subconscious mind that in the end, it doesn't even matter? Why cling desperately to the last thread of your pathetically worthless excuse of a life, knowing that someday, everyone on this miserable, godforsaken joke of a planet will die?"" the Doctor explained with a hint of sadness.

""All you have to do in order to find the true meaning of life is believe in yourself!"" Sue yelled at him. ""I learned it from reading The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy, no less! Guess a certain number between one and fifty.""

""Fourty-two, schmorty-two..."" the Doctor replied irritatedly. ""The whole world's falling straight into hell, you and me included!""

""Life...Dreams...Hope...where do they come from, and where do they go?"" the Doctor familiarly philosophized. ""None of that Final Fantasy JUNK is enough to fulfill your kingdom HEARTS!""

""ENSLAVEMENT! ENSLAVEMENT IS WHAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING!! ENSLAVE, ENSLAVE, ENSLAVE!!! LET'S ENSLAVE EVERYONE!!!"" As the poor batshit-insane bastard melodramatically screamed out his famous last words, the Undead Core exploded and burst into flames, leaving the remains of the Doctor's spirit floating in the air, cackling grimly.

""That was...beautiful..."" Misery whispered, with tears of joy trickling down her subtly smiling face. ""Sue, if you don't mind...can I give you a hug?"" she asked.

""What's the magic word?"" Sue asked smugly, crossing her arms and shutting her eyes as she said it.

""Sigh...please?"" Misery groaned. 

""NO!"" Sue yelled at her.

""Hey, don't feel so bad!"" Quote encouraged Misery, patting her shoulder. ""Maybe she'll say yes next time if you ask her more politely!""

""Don't you get it?"" Misery sobbed. ""There probably won't BE a next time, you frickin' lunatic!!"" she yelled, slapping him for dramatic effect.

""She's right!"" Sue realized out loud, pointing at the ceiling. ""This whole place is already crumbling from the inside out as we speak. It's about to fall apart for crying out loud! Come on, no more time for chit-chat, LET'S GO FOR GOD'S SAKE! Hurry up already!"" she explained frantically, grabbing Quote's arm and dragging him along behind her.

""You know what? Screw you guys. I'm not going home. I'd rather just die here with no friends to speak of."" Misery wept. ""Me and my shitty alcoholic emo self."" And then she just laid down on the floor and slept.

""Come on, let's keep going! Pick up the pace!"" Sue yelled as Quote was struggling to maintain the energy to keep running at full speed. ""If you don't sprint like a man, you might get crushed by these giant mysteriously-falling-from-the-sky bricks, like how Jack got crushed underneath Mahin's fatass body when the two of them unwittingly slept together in their jail cell!""

""Wait, WHAT?"" Quote asked frantically, shocked out of his mind. ""How in the hell did THAT happen?""

""To make a long story short, Mahin weighs approximately two tons and rolls around in bed a lot."" Sue explained.

""So Jack basically got ran over by a steamroller?"" Quote asked.

""Basically."" Sue replied, gasping for breath.

""Sue, go ahead and jump off the balcony. It's your only choice."" Quote instructed her. ""There's unfinished business I need to take care of in this prefab house.""

""Does it involve Curly?"" Sue asked slyly.

""Maybe."" Quote replied, shooting her a brief death glare and busting right through the front door to the house just as a giant brick was about to land right on top of him.

For unexplained reasons, there was now a hole in the floor. ""Well, what's a soldier without bravery, I suppose..."" he thought to himself, saving his progress and jumping straight down the hole.

""Welcome to hell."" A mysteriously satanic voice greeted him.

""Oh god. Oh man. Oh god, oh man, oh god, oh man, oh god, oh man, oh god, oh man!"" Quote moaned, trembling and wetting his pants a little. ""Well, what can I say? Even though I only have about 21 HP right now, this level shouldn't be too hard!""

TWENTY TRIES LATER...

""Alright, Curly, I've strapped you onto my back, ran directly through a shitstorm of giant falling blocks of doom, defeated hell's innumerable legions of fallen angels, maneuvered around a fuckload of spikes, narrowly avoided several instant death traps, bobbed and weaved through a myriad of arrows, leapt incredibly long distances, and kept a piece of bacon in my pocket."" Quote monologued. ""Are you ready for the grand finale, the icing on the cake, the truly ultimate awakening of ultimate justice?""

""I will be once you finally stop talking, my dear!"" Curly teased him.

""Alright, here we are, the final battle of ultimate des- Hey, wait a minute, what in the hell is this crap? We went through everything that this godforsaken shit heap of a level threw at us just for THIS!?"" Quote groaned irritatedly, looking up and seeing that the boss was actually nothing more than a giant mechanical Thwomp.

A FEW SECONDS OF LEVEL 2 BLADE SPAMMING LATER...

""Alright, it's dead, now get out of the way!"" Curly yelled as Quote lunged over to the far side of the room, landing on his chest; at that exact moment, Heavy Press's eye opened and it fell down to the ground, landing with so much weight and impact that it left a gigantic hole in the center of the floor. 

After jumping down the hole, Quote and Curly found themselves in the hallway that led from the Plantation to the Doctor's statue gallery. Quote decided to enter the statue room through the upper-right door first so that he could turn the statues into statues of the good guys; being a little on the narcissistic side, he decided to turn one of them into a statue of himself.

""Hey, what about Jack?"" Curly asked him. ""Why not him? I guess the poor kid just never gets any proper attention or recognition whatsoever...""

""Meh, he didn't really have much of a role in the story anyway."" Quote replied.

""WHAT?! You sick man! That's just downright cruel of you! He was such an innocent, cute and adorable little boy! Show the nerds some respect!"" Curly scolded him, lightly smacking him with the back of her hand.

Once he was finished with that tomfoolery, he went into the lower-right doorway of the main hallway, which led into another, much longer, outdoor hallway. For some reason, there was a whimpering ghost dog sitting at the end of the hallway.

""Aww, it's so cute!"" Curly moaned. ""Let's see what it has to say, shall we? Please please please?""

""Alright, alright, alright!"" Quote groaned exasperatedly, approaching the ghost dog. ""Hello, sir, what would your name be?"" he asked the dog.

""I don't have one."" the dog whimpered. ""Please kill my master. He literally tried to rape me and sell me on E-Bay, and his cruelty doesn't even end there! His magic power is so freaking OP! Please, I beg of you, please find some way to at least nerf it for God's sake!"" And with that, the dog vanished from existence.

Opening the next door, Quote and Curly fell into the vast Seal Chamber where Ballos was waiting for them. ""Wow, right in between two sets of spikes, how convenient!"" Quote said sarcastically.

""Skeletons carpeting the entire floor...ominous Roman pillars everywhere...wow, this is some hardcore Gothic shit right here!"" Curly complimented the architects who built the place.

Standing in the center of the room, right in front of his throne, was Ballos, with his eyes closed for some stupid reason; he was about three times Quote's height and had a psychotic grin on his face. ""Welcome, noobs. I am Ballos, the wicked Level 99 Wizard of the East."" he greeted them, with his right palm resting on his chest to emphasize his welcoming attitude toward them. 

""A few years ago, back when people actually gave a shit about World Of Warcraft, I was a world-renowned master of the game."" Ballos began to monologue. ""I would sit alone in my basement every day on my computer, clicking on monsters, casting magic spells, and talking shit on the voice chat. With my simple yet insanely effective strategy and a fair bit of hacking, I was essentially more or less unstoppable.""

""But then one day I let my power grow out of control."" he continued, with the crazy shit-eating grin still not disappearing from his face. ""The admins foolishly decided to ban me from the game for being too much of an obnoxious phallus-head, which made me awfully angry. If there's one thing you should know about Internet trolls, it's the fact that they can never quite stomach the things that they can dish out; in fact, this is actually their primary weakness, believe it or not.""

""And so the mighty heroes of Warcraft have fallen, thanks to the perpetual, unyieldingly endless stupidity of mankind."" he continued even further. ""Upon realizing my fate, I reinvented something that no man in modern times before me had even dared to reinvent...real life magic. Harnessing the true power of this twisted, destructive, maniacal new discovery of mine, I permanently erased World Of Warcraft and all of its creators from existence, and then I murdered my entire family as punishment for calling me a basement dweller.""

""And now that I've been eternally grounded for life here in this stinking Hell's chamber, I can no longer distinguish friend from foe. Anyone who is too feeble-minded and stupid to comprehend the nigh-limitless power of true black sorcery must be destroyed! Now, we shall see who's better equipped...IN A FIGHT TO THE DEATH!!!"" Ballos screamed, opening his eyes, one of which was glowing red. ""You wanted me? Well, NOW YOU'VE GOT ME!!!""

""So, uhh...were you even listening to all that?"" Ballos asked.

""Uhh...well, sorry, but...no, not really."" Quote replied, waking from his boredom-induced slumber. ""What game were you playing again?""

""WHY, YOU GODDAMNED MOTHERFUCKERS!!! GET THE HELL OVER HERE!!!"" Ballos screamed furiously, using his levitation powers to charge shoulder-first into Quote, sending him flying almost halfway across the room.

""Hmph..."" Ballos sneered. ""If my strength alone isn't enough to stop you, maybe THIS will!"" he yelled, levitating high up above them and casting Vile Voltage. A lightning storm was generated out of thin air, and, somehow, Quote was able to dodge every single bolt, even with the lightning clearly being attracted toward his metallic body.

""WHAT? This makes no fucking sense!"" Ballos yelled. ""Heroes really can survive anything, can't they?""

Standing directly underneath Ballos, Quote began pumping Polar Star shots into him. ""You DARE shoot me in the BALLS?"" Ballos yelled angrily, readying himself to summon one last bolt. ""YOU MUST DIE!!!""

However, forgetting that Quote was right above him, he summoned the bolt right above himself. The bolt hit him right in the brain, almost frying him unconscious...but he still had a few more tricks up his sleeve.

""Behold my true form and despair!"" Ballos commanded them dramatically as his bizarre new form, an enormous ball of rock with his face on it, landed on the floor. 

""What in the flying fuck is that thing?"" Quote asked.

""Dunno...looks a lot like the moon from Majora's Mask, except with Ballos' face on it."" Curly replied.

""THIS IS MY TRUE FORM!"" Ballos yelled at them. ""Behold it and despair!!""

And with that, Ballos jumped and landed on the floor three times in a row every few seconds, scattering bones everywhere each time as Quote ran under him. ""Wow, what a predictable pattern!"" Quote snickered.

""YOU DARE INSULT MY FLAWLESSLY MEMORABLE PATTERN?!"" Ballos yelled. ""Oh, wait..."" Sure enough, Quote was perched right on top of his lower eyelid. Ballos screamed in pain as Quote began spamming Level 2 blades into his eyes.

""THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM!"" Ballos screamed, shutting his now-blinded eyes and surrounding himself with a rotating octagon-shaped arrangement of eye rocks. ""LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN JUST RUN UNDER THIS- oh, wait."" 

Once Quote had blasted all eight eyes shut, Ballos levitated into the center of the room and began shaking, his eye-rock shield rotating rapidly as a similar, albeit much slower, rotating arrangement of platforms appeared around him.

""NOW...BEHOLD my TRUE form and DESPAIRRRR!!!"" Ballos screamed at the top of his lungs as his eye sockets and mouth burst open, splattering the blood of all the poor souls he had eaten all over the place.

""You got blood on my beautiful red HAT!"" Quote scolded him angrily. ""Now you're going to PAY!"" he yelled, taking out his missile launcher and blasting the shit out of the vulnerable half of Ballos' defense eyes, followed by Ballos himself. But just as he was about to defeat Ballos, he ran out of missiles. And his Polar Star was out of batteries as well, and, worst of all, Curly's Nemesis was even literally firing rubber ducks! ""Shit, what am I gonna do now?"" he thought to himself. ""There's demonic angels shooting me with flying arrows from all directions and I'm running out of health. There's only one thing left to do...""

Suddenly, King's spirit stopped time again. ""Use the grenade, Quote..."" King's voice echoed through Quote's mind. ""Trust us, Quote...we will gladly sacrifice ourselves if it means that the world will be saved from destruction. Rub lotion on our backs and we'll rub lotion on yours, Quote."" Jack explained. ""And we'll also give you a lollipop with a nice big smiley face on it too! YAY!"" Toroko added excessively.

""For fuck's sake, Jack, we're both dead! Not to mention that at least two of us are also straight!"" King corrected him. ""Oh, yeah, right...my bad."" Jack snickered.

""Whee! I love you so much, you're my favorite friend in the whole wide world! Look at me, I'm still just an adorable huggable cuddly-wuddly lil' bunny! Sweeter than a marshmallow! Huggie wuggie wuggie! Let's snuggle! YAY!"" Toroko squealed delightfully with more than a slight tinge of sarcasm, deliberately mocking her own irreplaceably intense cuteness.

""The grenade...THAT'S IT!"" Quote suddenly realized with delight, reaching into his back pocket and pulling out his one and only Holy Hand Grenade. Holding it up into the air, he watched as the grenade absorbed the vengeful spirits of Jack, King and Toroko.

""I HAVE THE POWER!!!"" Quote yelled epically at the top of his lungs, his voice echoing all the way from the Seal Chamber to Tokyo and back. And then, our savior, Quote, reached toward the heavens yet again, with grenade still in hand, saying, ""O King, bless this thy hand grenade that, with it, thou mayest blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy."" 

And with that, Quote threw the grenade with a combination of shockingly weak physical force and devastatingly powerful emotional force; he almost missed, but the spirits contained within the grenade allowed it to change course in midair and fly directly into Ballos' eye socket just as time began to flow again. ""Huzzah, motherfucker.""

The grenade exploded in an amazingly awesome and nuclear fashion, releasing so much light energy that it caused the entire room to flash pure white for several seconds, shattering Ballos into at least ten thousand bloody pieces and causing both Quote's and Curly's jaws to drop to the floor with sheer, utter amazement. And with that, Quote began to sing. ""Now you're dead, we're dead cause we killed you-""

""No time for celebration just yet!"" Curly reminded him. ""Do you hear someone speaking or is that just me?""

""Quote, Quote, Quote, Quote, Quote, Quote, Quote, Quote, Quote, Quote, Quote, Quote, Quote...IT HURTS, QUOTE...PLEASE...GO AWAY...OH, GOD...IT BURNS..."" Ballos's disembodied voice bone-chillingly moaned through the air as the walls began to close in on the two of them.

""Shit, what're we gonna do now?"" they frantically wondered to themselves. Suddenly, they heard a familiar voice. ""OH, YEAH!"" Balrog yelled as he busted in through the ceiling. ""Now that you've gotten rid of the Demon Crown's influence, Misery finally stopped whining about how emo she is and decided to let me help you guys. Thank the almighty Lord...I was so tired of hearing her listen to Linkin Park everywhere she went."" Balrog explained.

""Anyway, climb onto my body!"" Balrog commanded them, causing Quote to snigger. ""JUST CLIMB ONTO MY GOD-DAMNED HEAD AND GET THIS STUPID SHIT OVER WITH, WILL YOU!?"" Balrog yelled angrily at him.

And so they climbed onto him and he jumped right through the ceiling. ""Oh my god, is your head alright?"" Curly asked.

""Mimigas taste good with ketchup."" Balrog replied. ""ERR, I MEAN YES, MY HEAD IS PERFECTLY FINE!""

""I always did wonder about him..."" Quote whispered to Curly.

""What was that?"" Balrog asked him arrogantly.

""Oh, nothing."" Quote replied, whistling innocently. ""Let's just find a hotel and stay there for a night while we think about where to live, shall we?""

""That sounds alright!"" Curly replied as the island finally stopped falling. ""Hey, toaster, you got any money in ya?""

""I'M NOT A FRICKIN' TOASTER! WHEN WILL YOU PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT?!?"" Balrog screamed in pure pent-up aggravation at the fact that no one understood exactly what he was.

And so, back on the Earth's surface, the three of them spent their entire night in some random hotel room arguing about what Balrog was supposed to be, while Sue got herself reverted back into her dark-tan human form and got put on court trial by Kazuma for saying that she hated every ""white"" person on the island.

""TOASTER!"" Quote argued.
""SUITCASE!"" Curly argued back.
""LUNCHBOX!"" Quote argued back.
""TELEVISION!"" Curly argued back.
""BRIEFCASE!"" Quote argued back.
""INTERNET MEME!"" Curly argued back.
""BALLOS' SON!"" Quote argued.
""MINT BOX!"" Curly argued back.
""FISH CAN!"" Quote argued back.
""COMPUTER!"" Curly argued back.
""BATHTUB!"" Quote argued back.
""BAR OF SOAP!"" Balrog yelled exhaustedly at them. ""FOR THE LAST TIME, I! AM A FUCKING! BAR! OF SOAP!""

""I know you are, but what am I?"" Quote and Curly responded sassily as the two of them were sleeping fully-clothed in bed together.

""Jesus Christ, you two sound like a frickin' married couple!"" Balrog groaned, causing Quote and Curly to laugh their heads off.

And so Quote and Curly married; Jack, King and Toroko went to heaven, and to make a long story short, everyone lived happily ever after. Well, except for Jack, that is.

""Oh, come on, seriously, the cafeteria is serving meat loaf AGAIN?!"" Jack groaned.

I have no savings and can’t count on my parents to help me out. In 2 weeks, I start ‘the real world’ with a salaried job, but that also means starting to pay my student loans. I’ve heard great things from friends about this subreddit, so I was wondering if you guys might be able to help me out if with how to pay off my student loans (space out my payments or pay as much off at once?) and advice on how much to save from each paycheck (for future stability and potential vacations)? One thing that I’m definitely concerned about is over spending since I’ve never had much money in my bank account.  

Here’s a breakdown of my income:
-I volunteer, currently making $480 biweekly; will have my final stipend at the end of the month
-Not enough saved up to count for anything
-Starting another job in July with biweekly installments of what should be around $1000
-$5,600 education award that can only go towards paying off loans and/or grad school

Here’s the gist of my expenses:
-$1130 monthly expenses (including rent, apartment bills, health insurance, &amp; travel expenses) 
-$16,350 total loans plus interest rates 

I’ve been using food stamps for the past year, but I’m assuming that I will be spending around $300/month in food including groceries and eating out

TL;DR – Was a volunteer for a year with no savings. Need some advice on how to budget myself and start paying off my student loans.

Thanks in advance!",finance,1434405439

personalfinance,I am a 19(M) leaving to the air force on July 27. I'm looking to refinance my auto loan under a different bank with better interest.,"My main loan was for about $19300. I financed in November of 2014 with a monthly payment of $303.29. In the last 6 or so months I have brought it down to around $15550. I feel refinancing may be a good choice. My current interest rate is either 4.3 or 4.03 (I'm leaning more towards the 4.3). I have a 72 month term. 66 months left. The reason I feel refinancing might work is because I can bring down my monthly payment even if I leave the term length the same. I plan to finish the car off by next year, I also plan to refinance one last time at th $7k or $8k mark. Money is not an issue. The issue is I will get screwed up with the interest. Since its a daily compound, I once had go pay $97 for just interest. That means out of $303, 1/3 was interest. Anyways a lower monthly payment will help in case I ever do become tight on money, I don't have to worry about $300 instead it can me $280 or maybe even less. And of course if the interest isnt so high. I can put that money and hekp lower it even more. I don't plan to sell the car, my parents can make use of it and also I'll have a ride when I get back.

personalfinance,No Doc Home Equity Loans -- Do They Exist?,"I'm an entrepreneur, in the same business for 25 years (real estate in Eastern Europe), some very good and some really bad years.  I made a few million dollars during the good times and bought real estate.  I own my home and lake house (overseas) free and clear, and own two rental houses in the US.

My business was slaughtered in the 2009 crisis and I have been building it back up painfully and slowly, trying to keep my employees paid but not able to take any income myself.  Living on savings and running up my credit card balances.  Last year as I was making the deal which would save my company, I simply ran out of cash.  The deal took longer and longer to close, months of struggle with American lawyers representing the investors, delay after delay, and I started to miss mortgage payments on my rental houses.    Bank of America sent one of them to a servicing company -- I had missed one more payment than I thought.  American Express started asking me for huge balance pay-downs, one of which I had to ask to delay.

So all of a sudden, after a lifetime of having money in the bank and having excellent credit which I hardly used for anything, suddenly I find myself as a dodgy character with ruined credit and no history of income the last years.

I was planning to sell a valuable old car I own to get out of this mess, but the deal fell through at the last moment.  Now I can either sell it for 50c on the dollar (a 50k or 60k loss), or I need to do some more work on it and put it back on the market -- a process of months.  In the mean time, I really need about 50k to stabilize my short-term situation.

I have about $400,000 of equity in my two rental houses, which have recovered all the value they lost in 2009, and then some.  I have owned them for 25 years.  How can I get $50k of this equity out quickly with bad credit and little income?   What banks or other financial institutions offer a product like this?  I don't mind paying a higher interest rate as I would pay this off probably already next fall.  But I have no idea where to turn -- I have no experience with this sort of thing.

I will be very grateful for any tips or advice.",finance,1434412652
personalfinance,MyFedLoan claiming my loans are delinquent for a few days after I make payments. Will this harm my credit?,"Okay, so I'll give some background. Today was the second time this has happened to me. I automatically make payments on my loans every month on the 13th. They take the money out of my checking account and all is well. That is, until last April when they claimed my loans were delinquent. I called them in a panic, explaining to them that they had even taken the money from my account, my profile showed that I paid, so why is it showing as delinquent!? Their excuse is that it is just a problem with their billing system and I was assured that it would not affect my credit. 

This happened to me again today and I am starting to get worried. Now they have a notice stating that

&gt;     Please be aware that your account may be showing 1-3 days delinquent if your due date is on a non-banking day. Your payment will be extracted on the next business day.

The situation is the same today as well. My account on the MyFedLoan site shows that I paid and they have already taken the money out of my checking account.

So my question is, will these errors have a negative impact on my credit? Do loan sites like MyFedLoan automatically report delinquencies to the credit agencies? Don't know too much about all of this, so all insight is greatly appreciated.",finance,1434413166

personalfinance,Sanity Check w/ 200k Student Loans,"Hi all,

As the title says, I have about 160k principle in student loans and the current balance is close to 200k with accumulated interest. 160k of it is in the form of private loans from both Wells Fargo and Sallie Mae. The average interest rate is ~6.2%. I currently have 8 federal government loans, 4 loans from Wells Fargo, and 2 from Sallie Mae. I want to know how to consolidate this best so that I am not making 14 monthly payments!

A little background info about me...

I just graduated with a BS in Computer Science degree from a top 10 university. I accepted a job in Silicon Valley for a Fortune 100 and will be making 92K guaranteed, with it hopefully being closer to 130k with overtime. I also received a 15k signing bonus, and 10k stock option bonus vested over 3 years. I have about 10k in gifted mutual funds and 6k cash in savings. I own a car. I have no other debt.

I plan on living in San Francisco, my rent with roommates will be about 2000 a month with utilities and I estimate 500 to 700 in food expenses.

I plan on starting repayment in August. I also plan to use my signing bonus so that I have 3 months of expenses already saved. For the first few months, I plan to pay 1.5k a month and my parents offered to pitch in 500 a month. It is my plan to start paying 2k a month in January on top of my parents 500. Using the loan calculators, this is about a 7 year plan.

My initial plan was to use the federal government consolidation plan to consolidate the 8 federal loans as listed here: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/consolidation

I plan to use the Wells Fargo to consolidate the 4 loans I have with them, I would do them all but they have a limit of $120k. I was going to leave the Sallie Mae loans alone. After the consolidations, this would leave me paying on 4 loans a month, much better than 14.

Does my plan seem sane, does anyone else have better advice?",finance,1434415126

Many colleges are notorious for ratcheting up the price of attendance in years following the first, but that wasn't entirely why mine shot up (for starters, my brother is no longer a dependent of my parents).  Anyways, I was lucky enough to not have to take out any loans in my first year, and my tuition was mostly paid for by my parents -- I pitched in 3k from savings on top of the scholarships I received. 

This year, I don't think we're in a good enough position to pay the 30k outright, so I want to ask: how should I proceed? I plan on speaking with the financial aid office, but I don't expect much to change on that front. Is it best for my parents to take out a loan, and hold me responsible for it down the line when I have a meaningful income? I plan on taking out a subsidized federal loan, but I don't know if an unsubsidized loan would be a smart move. I'm grateful that my parents are contributing heavily to my education, but I don't want to saddle them with everything.  Any help is much appreciated!",finance,1434424632

A nice two to three bedroom house in this area is around $150k. My buddy has a $900 house payment. In a year when my lease would be up, would it be to my benefit to take $10k from my Roth $10 to $15k from my old job's 401k and the rest in savings to put down 20% on a home or to save and plan for 3-4 years out?

personalfinance,Pity Party - Table for 1,"I was scrolling through Facebook the other evening, and I saw a post from my SIL with pictures of her and her two pre-teen sons at Kobe, with a caption saying something about stopping in for lunch. I kept scrolling and I saw another picture of my Cousin-in-Law (yes, I'm making up that term) with her husband and two even younger sons also coincidentally eating dinner at Kobe. I didn't think much of it at the time, but for some reason as the day went on I kept thinking about them and I had an unusual-for-me moment of pure envy. 

So I looked at my husband and told him about it, and had a mini pity party: ""How come they can eat out all of the time?"" ""Do you know how expensive Kobe is and they just stopped in for *lunch*?"" ""*I* want to eat out for every meal."" Whaaaa. And my husband just looked at me like I was crazy (because usually I am the far more sensible and frugal one) and pointed out that they put the meal on a credit card. They lost 2 houses to foreclosure. They pay something like 16% interest rate on their loan for their new SUV because their credit score is so low. They likely have $0 in a savings account. We have no credit card debt and are almost done with our student loan debt. We have a few dollars in savings. We have a paid for car. We have credit scores in the vicinity of 800.

 Please understand, we are not misers and we eat out plenty often, but for us the idea of popping in for a $50+ lunch is insanity. For us we'd feel like we were going nuts with a $15 lunch, and a $50+ meal at Kobe would be just for a special occasion, a celebration, or to splurge from an unexpected windfall. So, I don't have a question or even a point I'm trying to make here, /r/pf, I just wanted to share my moment of weakness and my reminder that what seems real is often just smoke and mirrors.

personalfinance,Our CU is offering home equity loans at 0.27% for the first 6 mos. I want to use it to pay off my high-interest student loans. Yes? No? Problem?,"Hi PF! I'm not a PF guru - I'm just one half of a household trying to pay down my debt as quickly and efficiently as possible. In the last year, we've buckled down and made huge progress in our loan repayments, for which I thank this subreddit! 5 student loans and 1 car loan down - 4 student loans and 1 car loan to go.

Here is why I come to you today.

THE FACTS: 

Our trusted local credit union is offering home equity loans for 0.27% APR for the introductory 6 months. After 6 months, the rate returns to ""pre-promotion rate"" of between 2.75% and 6.75%. This is to celebrate their 27th branch opening, and to us, seems like too good a deal to pass up as we are now one year deep in our loan repayment blitz.

Per our credit union, we have about $30k in available home equity.

We have $27k in student loans, which we are slated to finish repayment for in 13 months (goal pay-off date is July 4, 2016, which we are on target to accomplish barring any unforeseen catastrophes).

Interest rates for aforementioned student loans are as follows:
$16,000 at 6.55%;  
$6,000 at 5.54%; 
$3,000 at 4.25%; 
$3,000 at 2.1%.

PF, is it wise for us to wipe out my student loans with this home equity loan, or *at the very least*, to use this home equity loan to wipe out those student loans with interest around 6.55% (which total about $16k)?

To the layperson, this offer seems like a great way to ramp up our repayment. I pay around $100 in interest every month on these student loans, which to me, is $100 that could be going toward daycare or groceries. And along comes 0.27% APR....

I want to make sure we're not overlooking anything before we set up a meeting with a loan officer about this.

New member here. I have been relatively ignorant about PF for a few years now and got into tuning it recently. I scoured the reddit wikis and flyertalk about topics and fixed some obvious pf mistakes e.g. moved my liquid money into online savings account(1.00% APY vs 0.01APY in branches),  maxing my 401k as much as my can, paying my credit cards bill in full, applied for new rewards creditcards and doing a tiny bit of MS to meet cc min spends(towards travel). 

I am really excited so I am trying to get into this habit more and it feels like I only know a drop in the ocean. So I am looking for topics to learn either here or on online courses or blogs even. Would be great if you experienced people can suggest some. 

Specifically, I am looking for techniques/courses which can tremendously improve my expenditure/savings such as getting proper mortgage, cutting high useless expenses, travel hacking(using MS) or smaller savings such as getting credit card bonuses, investment on my liquid income etc... Also, courses which improve my understanding of how things such as financial markets affect us e.g. interest rates, prices etc would be beneficial too.   

I am posting here since I feel that this knowledge would be useful to a lot of people.

This money represents all of the ""retirement"" savings my mom has, after a lifetime of self-employment in the depressed U.S. agriculture industry and saving as she and my dad could.  She is receiving Social Security payments, but is earning enough right now from property investments and other passive income streams that she is able to deposit all Soc.

However, she is not in the best of health (not sick, just not as healthy as she could be) and a lot of her income sources will dwindle/be divided between family members within a 10 year window. My sister and I are committed to taking care of her when/if her money runs out, but she's very independent. I want to be sure that her savings is there when she needs it.

personalfinance,School and Student Loans,"Hey /r/personalfinance, 

Just a little background information, I graduated back in 2012 and attended a modest state school. For my freshman year my parents said they would co-sign on a loan. it was a 12,000 dollar loan at a 12 percent interest rate. Towards the end of the year I got a call from my mom saying they would not co-sign on anymore loans. So im stuck with this debt, no degree and no way to pay it back. 

My family is pretty well off. EX. My parents are building a brand new 3 million dollar home on the Missouri river. They decided they werent going to help me out with loans because I am no longer active in the LDS church.

  Due to their income I dont qualify for FASFA. For some reason Im still considered a dependent even know I live in a different state, I File my own taxes and receive 0 support from them. 

So my question is, what are my options? I would like to go back to school and get my degree but with this loan payment and bills, saving any money is difficult. Any help or insight you guys could offer would be great.",finance,1434468563
personalfinance,"New credit card company calling repeatedly for missed payment, but have never sent me a bill. How best to handle it?","Edit:  Went home to get the customer service number off of the card/paperwork.  They did make a mistake with the address (their mistake as my application has it written correctly). Called and talked to a non-outsourced customer service person instead of a collection ghoul.  She had no problem verifying the address and the interest rate (unlike the other 3 people who called me), rescinded the fee (which the first person said they didm and then didn't) and I made the payments. (Bonus, the collections ghouls made various threats about interest rates exploding and all that, which the CS person said wouldn't happen even if the late payment was completely my fault).

Sad that I had to take time out of my day because companies can't be arsed to have decent customer service and treat their customers like deadbeats from day 1.

Original:
I got an interest-free-for-a-year Home Depot credit card (citibank) to pay for a blown out air conditioner (times are tough and our emergency money was already too low).

We never received the bill and they started calling for missed payment.  None of the paperwork I received when I sign up has a bill, due date, payment amount, etc. On the first call, I told them I never received a bill and it is my understanding that they need to provide a bill at least 21 days before it is due.  She was polite and apologized and said they would send it out and we would have it in 7to 10 days (still haven't received it, but it hasn't been 10 business days yet).  She said any fees and whatnot would be reversed.  Next 2 calls were not so polite and now I am getting frustrated and angry.

My fear is that I will have to fight the fees, fight any hits to my credit report, and fight to keep the no interest rate, since non-payment typically negates such offers.  (the cynic in me believes that they do this very thing on purpose).

Worst comes to worst, I can do a 0% balance transfer onto one of my empty cards, but of course there will be a fee for that as well.

Does just paying it over the phone (without seeing the bill or what sort of BS they have added to it since i ""missed"" the payment) ""accept"" my fate and make it harder to fight fees, etc.?  What can I say/do to make sure I am not screwed-over here?

Edit:  Wow. A lot of the people on this sub really automatically assume the worst of a person.  No where did I say i wasn't responsible for the payment.  Just that i didn't want to get hit with fees and various bullshit from *their* mistake.

I wonder how many of the people on the sub who act like this work for the banks that treat people like shit because they can. Gonna guess quite a few.",finance,1434470048
personalfinance,Financing calculating help,"Hey guys!

This might seem like a dumb question and I feel dumb for asking since I am normally good at this kind of math.

I am a young guy (22) that's looking to buy a motorcycle. I have quite a bit of extra money to afford one so that's not an issue. Getting a loan with my lack of credit is.

Bitcoin,Time for a Game Plan,"As we seem to be bouncing off some kind of bottom, with a backlog of good news about growth and capital, it feels like reality may be conspiring to set off another rise and for this I wanted to set out a game plan. Not a plan for making a shitload of money though that may be possible, a plan that has little to do with following every twist and turn of Bitcoin, but a plan that focuses on life and happiness. How can you survive a rise with some semblance of a normal life?

The price has been climbing for a week straight and while it could turn down any time, shit happens fast, and like an ER technician, you're going to need to react and depend on your mental preparedness to keep you from doing stupid things. You may be compelled to act in strange ways, not all of them positive. So these are some tips to survive another Bitcoin bubble, and Bitcoin itself on a personal, whole-life level.

1. Keep a clear head. Yeah, I know, ""Don't tell me what to do, man!"" Quit doing whatever drugs you are doing and don't get into any new ones. During this time, increases may be adding thousands to your net worth in days, hours and minutes. Now, I don't know your particular relationship to money but each of us has a more complicated one than we can actively comprehend. Money is power. Time is money. It's heavy stuff. Time and bitcoins are things that, once wasted, you can't get back. When you find yourself with more money, even on paper it affects where you think you fit in the world, how you think of the future, what you can afford, your risk tolerance. I don't think most of us are setup to deal with so many things changing with that number so quickly. You will want a clear head to be able to follow whatever plan you setup and to deal with curveballs.

2. Seek healthy ways to handle stress. This will reduce your chances of choosing less-healthy coping methods that sacrifice your intellectual clarity for short-term relief. Exercise. Meditate. Get a massage. Take up a hobby. Exercising the creative areas of your brain helps reduce, relieve, and process stress. Writing, coding, drawing, painting, sculpting, and cooking each provide an opportunity to do something new and to relieve tension. Carry a notebook to capture your ideas. Seek out challenging tasks. Spend time in natural settings with sunlight if you can find it. 

3. Keep your commitments. You don't need to calculate your net worth every hour. When the bubble is over and volatility reduces, you'll have normal life to deal with and you'll find money can't solve every problem it's possible to create during a fit of reckless exuberance. Keeping your committments means not allowing the market to reprioritize your schedule on short notice. People inevitably depend on you for things so keep doing those things. Trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair. I speak from experience having effectively quit my job in a suboptimal way.

4. Increase your security knowledge and improve your security practices. Any funds in online wallets should be minimized to just what is needed for trading. Reduce amounts stored in your own hot wallets to a minimum.  Have a process to check and adjust this weekly or more often depending on just how much you're dealing with and your risk tolerance. Hacking attempts increase with the rise in price. 1 BTC sitting on a server at $200 is different than 1 BTC sitting on a server at $500 or $1000. The danger gloriously multiplies if one, ten, or one hundred BTC are currently within your comfort zone. 
Get a trezor or pick up an old laptop and repurpose it to run Tails or Ubuntu from a CD only (usually you can pull the hard drive and wifi card with just a screw driver). Prepare cold storage wallets, test them, and learn how to store them securely. Learn about BIP38, Shamir's secret sharing, encrypted disks, safes, and safe deposit boxes. If you can reduce your chances of being hacked, it's probably worth the time spent beefing up defenses.

5. Prepare for taxation. Learn about capital gains tax. Besides federal or national capital gains tax, your state, province, county, or cell block may have additional tax to pay during profitable sales. Know your tax liability before you trade so you understand how much you need to set aside for the man.

6. Be careful talking about your holdings or the profits you have tallied up on paper. When in doubt, don't talk about it. Techies are generally helpful people and when we think we've cracked the not-being-a-millionaire problem, it's very tempting to help others benefit. Unfortunately the ideal case, where you recommend someone ""get in on this"", they do, and then they sell for a quick profit seldom happens. More likely is that they buy at the top and hodl, blaming you for every nanosecond they are negative, possibly ending the nightmare by panic selling. And if they are wise enough to hold off on possibly purchasing at the peak, they'll either taunt you for being rich or will berate you for not acheiving stable lunar orbit. It's a no-win situation.

7. Prepare for a rise ahead of time. Develop a version of this plan for yourself that you can follow or ignore with prejudice.

Hope it helps. Stay safe people.",cryptocurrency,1434471479

personalfinance,Cash out vs Borrow against Life Insurance,"Hey y'all,
I am about to start my senior year of university and I would just like a bit of advice. I currently have a life insurance policy from Prudential that, if cashed out, would pay for my last year of university. The cash out value is around $12,000. The payout if something happened to me is around $125,000. Now, I am only 21 with no signs of dying anytime soon. I have no one I am looking after and the payout, if something did happen to me, would go straight to my parents (which is fine, but they don't necessarily need it). I am trying to graduate with the least amount of debt as possibly, so cashing it out is tempting.

However, I could borrow against it. This is not a normal consumer loan. If I don't pay any interest, when the value of the loan is equal to the value of the payout, the policy cancels along with the loan. I can only borrow 90% of the current cash value. The interest rate is around 2%. I understand Prudential is trying to get me to borrow against it (more money for them and I can possibly save the policy). But I just do not see a value in it. I am an Econ major and I have run some calculations, and I just do not think the future value is worth the current present value.

What do y'all think? Cash out or borrow?",finance,1434472401

I bought it through Carmax and am financing through a third-party; my payments are $350.14/mo. The outstanding balance now is $13.6k. I've put about 20k miles on it, I drive a lot for my job so leasing wasn't really an option. However, when I bought it, I didn't realize I'd be moving to a very expensive city to start graduate school where I'll be taking a substantial pay cut that will cause me to have to sell my car. I love this car, it's been great to me and it's still in great condition, but I have to get rid of it. Just for your info, when I bought it, I had only had a credit card for two months and hadn't yet started paying off my student loans, so my credit score wasn't great. My interest rate is about 13%. If KBB is any indicator (I know it's not always realistic), I should be able to sell it for $10.9k to a private party.

Two questions: First, when I sell it, should I refinance the car to see if I can get the monthly payments down with a lower interest rate? To be honest, I'm not sure how refinancing works... Second, what happens with the title? I assume if I sell it to a private party, they'll want the title, but technically I don't own the title - the financing inst. does - so how does that transfer work?

personalfinance,Taking out a second car loan for my boyfriend,"My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) have been dating for a year, and will likely get married next spring. He works for a high-end realty company, was just hired a month ago. This just takes some time to get into. 

He desperately needs a new car to show clients properties in. The trade-in value on his current car is about $500. We found a car yesterday that is perfect for what he needs, at a good price. He'd need to finance $12,000 of it. 

His credit is pretty bad from student loans. They offered him APR of 10.9%. His monthly payments would be $300. 

I, on the other hand, have great credit (725) and my car loan is at 1.9%. 

We started discussing the possibility of putting the new car in my name, and he could (I suppose) be a co-signer on it. If we got the same 1.9% financing rate, the car payments would go down to $207/month. 

It seems silly to get locked into that high interest rate JUST because we aren't married yet. This is a 5-year loan... and he would spend $5,000 more than necessary if he took it out in his name.

We've discussed the issues of if we broke up, even the small likelihood of that occurring. 

What are we missing here? Anything? I'd put the car insurance on my policy with his name on it, and he would just do an auto-deposit to my account each month.

personalfinance,[Planning] Recent college graduate in a unique situation needing short and long term budgeting strategies,"**Little Background:** I am a first generation immigrant to the US who moved here with my parents when I was 17. My parents are in their early to mid 50's with little to no savings (maybe $10k-15k at most). They owned a business in my home country but the political and economic situation got really bad they almost went bankrupt. They were able to get a permanent resident status in the US so decided to move with little money they had to ensure a bright future for me and my sister. 

I am 22 right now, recently graduated from college with a degree in Chemical Engineering with no job yet. I made a huge mistake early on when I decided to move to a different state far away, get student loans, make my parents sign up for a Parent PLUS loan just so I can get the education I want.  On top of that I also did not get a credit card and have no credit history. I was also not able to secure an offer before graduation.

**Current Situation:** So I have 30k in federal student loans, my parents have 32k in parent PLUS loans (I'm planning to pay all of that myself). No credit card debt. No savings. I have about $980 in bank, no job. I have been getting interviews recently and I have two interviews lined up this week. I just got an offer for a job unrelated to my major that requires me to move again to a different state (moving expenses are reimbursed). The job is offering me 46k, 50% match up to first 6% in 401k, medical, dental and vision with a 40-45 hour work week. However, I am not interested in the position much, and afraid that it will affect my future career prospects. If I manage to get a job for one of the positions I'm interviewing for this week, I may be looking at 50-60k salary at least with similar benefits. These jobs are related to my field and so I hope I can expect to be near the median Engineering salary (80-90k) within 5 years. So would it be wise for me to take the job that is offered right now in case I don't get the ones I am interviewing for or should I try to move back home and wait it out for a better job in my field?

**Future Plans/Expectations:** I am not planning on having kids, I don't want kids. I understand this may change once my past 30 but right now I don't think I will ever want kids. I do want to be able to take care of my parents once they reach 65-ish (~10 years). I have a girlfriend who is very understanding of this situation. She is also a STEM grad but planning to go to grad school for a higher degree. As it is right now, assuming I get married to this wonderful girl I can see our net earnings to be well past 100k per year in the future. So my question is how can I plan my budget best to ensure that I can have good retirement savings and also take care of my parents as well. Additionally, I also have a sister who will be going to college in 2 years. My sister will also likely assist my parents financially once she is in her mid-20s to take care of my parents. My parents also want to buy their own house, I have advised against it for now since I want to be able to be in a position where I can financially help them out if necessary.

investing,Why and what bonds at this point?,"I'm a little stymied due to very limited bond investing options in my 401K.  I'd like more diversity, and some hedge, but I really only have four options:

* Stable Value (pros, a designated goal of maintaining a fixed NAV, relatively stable dividends that at least keep up with inflation.  1.4-1.7%.  Cons, fixed NAV so no chance of appreciation, but it should absolutely provide a hedge if a massive correction provides a buying opportunity, as well as earning slightly more than my emergency fund does.

*  VBMPX - Vanguard diversified public bond fund, at least medium term, everything is stated to be greater than 1 year.  It's already give up about 5% in the recent months, and I expect it will give up more once rates start to climb.  Dividends are running about 2-2.5% annually.  Fees are dead low, but I wouldn't consider this particularly safe in a rising interest rate environment due to the maturity dates.

* BROAD MARKET BOND I - this is a brand new option this year.  I don't know much about it except that it is also an intermediate term portfolio, and has much higher fee than the Vanguard bond fund.

* Vanguard target date funds - the one closest to my hoped for retirement date would be 2030.  According to the prospectus, the weighted average maturity  is 9.1 years, so again, not particularly safe at all in a rising interest environment IMO.

I currently have almost 10% in VBMPX.  It is the only bond type holding in any of my accounts.  With the exception of my emergency fund which is cash and larger than average, everything else is in a blend of US equities, equity options, equity funds, and foreign equity funds.  Individual equities make up only about 5% of my total holdings.

Two potential options I'm considering is either moving the money from VBMPX  to Stable value to provide hedge.  OR moving it to equity funds, and then going hunting what I'd consider a safer bond fund in my Roth Brokerage accounts.

personalfinance,Advice: Is it worth borrowing against my 401K to pay for a medical procedure?,"Well, the title really sums up the issue, but here are the details.  My apologies for any violations of reddiquette, this is my first time posting to this sub. 

I have been recommended by my doctor to have a medical procedure that should eliminate pain I have been dealing with for many years.  The issue is that the cost of co-pays, co-insurance, and anesthesia will be only $200 less than the entirety of my savings, which is a very scary place to be.  

Here are the options as I see them:
1. Delay having the surgery until my next round of bonuses (in 9 months).  I have been dealing with this pain for a long time, so physically I could probably cope, but I'm told that the longer I wait, the more I put myself at risk for permanent nerve damage.

2. Borrow against my 401K (at a pretty reasonable interest rate) to cover the cost of the surgery, and pay it off in increments.  Presumably I could pay the remaining amount off with next year's bonuses, although I am not certain.  I can only borrow once against my 401K, though, so if something else comes up then I will be screwed.

3. Try to take out a personal loan of some sort, or try to get an increase in my credit limit on a credit card, both of which would probably result in higher interest rates than what would be against my 401K.  

I'm about 30 years from retirement, and have a little over $40k in my 401K.  

I sincerely don't know what the right answer is here - I hate the idea of continuing on any longer in pain. I hate even more the loss of my safety net or taking on debt to resolve it.

So I have some credit card issues that are just killing my ability to get ahead financially.  Heres a summary of how I got here:

About 2 years ago I decided I wanted to do some traveling as my work allowed for a flexible schedule and it had always been a dream of mine.  I spent 6 weeks traveling in Europe, but I racked up some debt along the way.  At first it didn't seem like a big deal however.  I lived with my parents and had racked up debt in the past but was always able to pay it off without too much trouble.  However, after I got back from my travels I couldn't go back living at home due to some family conflicts and was forced to move out.  So now with all this new debt I have about $600 a month in new expenses that I didn't have when I racked up all of this debt and have not been able to pay it down ever since.

1.) Chase Freedom with a balance of $1,153.37 at a 15.24%APR
2.) Discover IT with a balance of $3,487.40 at 0% apr.  Did a balance transfer on this one and the 0% rate is up on 7/31/15
3.) Discover with a balance of $4739.42 with a ridiculous 28.99% APR.  (Makes me sick.  Didn't realize the interest rate was that high)

I make about 35k a year so this is obviously too much cc debt to be having.  I need advice on how to tackle this.

I've thought about selling my car.  I have about $700 left on my car loan but it's a 2004 Infiniti and I could sell for it about $6000.  There are some lease deals around my area where I could get a civic for $210 with nothing down.  I would essentially be swapping one debt for another but at least it wouldn't be a stupid high interest rate and I would be getting rid of an 11 year old car that is starting to have issues and be able to clear about $5k that could be used to wipe out some of this debt.

Should I get a debt consolidation loan?  Should I sell my car?  I have no idea how to tackle this and would really appreciate some guidance.  Thanks for advance for your response",finance,1434488374

personalfinance,FDIC Insured Savings Accounts Question,"I want to deposit funds into a savings account and start generating some income on it.  My local bank offers .30% but Amex offers .90%

In Amex's (and all banks I suppose) disclaimer they say:

*American Express Bank, FSB is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Your deposits are insured by the FDIC to at least $250,000 per depositor.*

What is my risk if I put in $260,000.00? Does this mean if Amex ""fails"" I will potentially lose only 10,000 maximum?

I do not generally understand how this works.  I have more to transfer than the FDIC insured limit, what do I do with the excess to be safe? **Is it possible Amex can fail on a whim without notice?** Or are they just listing this as a ""feature""?

How risky would it be to say put 500,000 in the savings account? I want to move it out of my fee sucking checking. (yes, I know this is not smart)

personalfinance,Should I pay off all my debts or leave some (so I have credit history) prior to applying for a mortgage?,"I inherited a decent amount of money... Enough that I can finally be 100% debt free and still put 20% down on a house and have some left over for emergencies. 

I only have student loan debt, but it totals about $19k. There are probably 10 separate loans ranging in interest rates from 2.5% to about 10%. Also, the life of these debts range from about 10 years to 5 years. Also, if it matters, my credit score is somewhere between 720-760 depending on where I get it (USAA, mint, and experian have all given me scores in this range and when I got my car loan -paid off too - about 4 years ago, it was 736)

As the title says, I'm looking to buy a house and put 20% down soon too. Which puts me in a 'what's the *best* way to handle this' type of situation. 

So, 

1) I could pay off my debt and do the happy dance that I'm debt free... My debt to income would essentially be zero, which is beneficial for getting a home loan. But I'm wondering if that'll lower my credit score since I would no longer have any active credit history (I've heard closing credit accounts hurts your score...). 

2) I could pay off only my most recent debts and leave the older ones active until after I sign a mortgage. Or,

3) pay down all of the debt so that there is just a little bit left in each account. I assume I would still maintain credit history and I would have a low debt to income ratio. 

What should I do PF?",finance,1434495364
personalfinance,22 yr old college student who is behind on student loans.,"I was supposed to start paying my loans back January 2015. I have not made a single payment because, due to a change of address and my own ignorance, I was unaware. I am currently behind $1,478.65 on the loan, and am supposed to be making payments of $296.00 a month. I do not qualify for lower payments. I am thinking about forbearing the loan until January of next year. This will give me an opportunity to catch up on the loan and finish school before I have to pay it back. The downside of this, as I understand it, would be a higher interest rate in the long run. (FYI the entirety of my student loan is $29,184)
I am not done with school. I received no financial aid last year and opted to defer my payments for a quarter. Now I owe my school $5,201, and as a result they will not disperse financial aid for me to attend next quarter until I pay this amount. 
Initially I thought the most logical thing to do about this would be to take out a loan from my bank (CitiBank), pay off all the money I am currently behind on, and make payments on the bank loan every month. Unfortunately I did not get approved for a loan because I have a credit score of 536. A large part of this is due to the student loans I am so behind on. 
I have three jobs and if I work as many shifts as possible, without killing myself, I could potentially make about $2,000 per month. about $530 of that will go to rent and utilities. I am at a complete loss and could really use some advice. I hope this shit show makes sense. I'm willing to answer any questions. Thank you!",finance,1434497323

personalfinance,"First job -- trying to manage expenses/debt and set up a financial plan. Catch is, I'm a little later in life.","Hello all! 

At the ripe ol' age of 30 I finally completed my college education and landed a solid first job with good starting salary that I start next month. I have school debt, and a decent amount of cash saved up. Here are my current financials:


* **Income:** ~3300 a month after taxes sub 401k contribution.

* **Student Loans:** ~ $48,000 with about 10k with a 6.8% interest rate, and the rest at 2-4%. First payment of 500 dollars due at the end of July.
* **~13k in savings.** 

* **Living situation**: I have two options. Rent for 600-1000. Or honestly, as much as I'd hate to do it, live at home for a year and use as much money to pay off loans as possible.

Total Possible Expenses:

* Live at Home: ~70 for phone bill, 70 car insurance,  50 a month in supplements, 125 dollars a month for gas (1hr 30 min round-trip commute)

       ***Total Expenses:* ~300-350 leaving $3000 - 401k - entertainment.**

*  Rent somewhere: 600-1000 for rent, + 150-200 in utilities/internet, + 200-250 a month in food (if not more, including weight lifting supplements), 70 for phone, 70 car insurance.

       ***Total Expenses:*** 1140 - 1600 a month, leaving  2150 to 1600 a month - 401k - entertainment expenses (not sure on this yet).

Thoughts and Questions:

* Currently my employer offers great benefits outside of NOT matching 401k ( supposed to change come November). I am 30 and have missed 10 years of 401k contribution. I was thinking of starting at 5%. Should I go higher? 

* I want to pay off my student loans as fast as possible (seems like the smartest thing to do). I can either just pay 500 a month (or more) and approach it avalanche style and hit the 6.8% loans first, or do a 10 year plan (which I could change) that increases every 2 years (300, 380, ~550, ~869). Should I consider taking some of my savings and just knocking out like...10k of loans?

* I might consider buying a newer car in the range of 15-25k (300 a month?) My car gets great gas mileage, has cheap insurance, but it is incredibly uncomfortable for an hour and a half + commute every day, and outside of the engine, is in utter shambles (no current working radio or A/C, original suspension, etc.) I could also put some money down and really lower this to like 200 or less a month. If I do, I might consider keeping my current shit-box for winters or other things.
* I'd like to put a certain amount of money aside each month for a travel. Perhaps in another savings account.

* Should I start to consider investing? I just don't really know the first thing about investing in general.

Anyway, I'm looking for general thoughts and feedback on the above in terms of what people think the right plan of action is. I'm thinking that even though I'm 30, living at home for a year could go a long way. I don't currently have a significant other, and living at home *may* make that a little bit more difficult, which is unfortunate, but it makes a lot of sense considering how much I could throw right at my loans. Is there anything else blatant that I'm missing or should be doing?

This could be good for bitcoin as people willingly move away from forced negative interest rates. Bank runs now may become bitcoin runs, where funds are not withdrawn as cash but perhaps converted to bitcoins in the event of a bank crisis. 

I worry however that a cashless society could have a negative effect on Bitcoin. Currently the vast majority of illegal transactions is performed in cash.

I'm pretty good with technology but basic at PC specs and the like, a pre-built laptop would be ideal (and my desktop for example runs the game fine and is connected to my TV, however the fan's pretty loud when in-game, but that doesn't bother me too much).

Ideally the laptop should run the game at your basic 1080p/ 60fps, and I need to be able to buy it from the UK (so maybe websites like amazon.co.uk, PC World, etc.).

personalfinance,[UK] Family death will mean my household inherits just under £500k,"I'm posting this mainly out of curiosity on the best way to invest the near £500k my father will inherit when my nan and granddad die.

BACKGROUND:

Currently my family finances are stable, my father's been in a government job (No secret agent stuff, don't worry Reddit.) that sees him earn £50,000 (Excl. tax) per annum, We currently own the house we live in which is bout £180k in the current market and everything's great, my mum earns money on the side which is around £10k a year so it boosts us up to £60k per year without tax.

However, with my grandparents declining health, and an inheritance sum just shy of half a million, what would be the best way to invest the money?

I'd love suggestions that could take into account the following;  
A) Total money invested  
B) Total monthly income  
C) Total money gained back from investment  
D) Any profits/potential monetarist or other gains associated with the investment  

I'm new to reddit, so please tell me if you need any more information! Would love your opinion!

(I've already looked into some bank interest rates and from a quick glance it looks as if £500,000 and above could secure a 2 year 4.25% per annum interest rate that would yield a return of over £23k, providing my maths is correct)

What do I mean by ""inner game?"" As explained in the famous book *The Inner Game of Tennis*, the inner game is the game that goes on inside your head while you're playing a match. Most great players have a great inner game. When they lose a point, they don't dwell on it. When they are about to play a match against Roger Federer, they really *believe* that they can win. And even if they *do* win, they can still find things they could have improved in their play.

When I started my journey to become a data scientist, I was wracked with anxiety. I didn't really know anything about machine learning. Hell, I could barely program a computer. I tried to audit a Java programming class and left after a week. My inner game was weak, and I was stuck. I found some inspiration in the book [The Now Habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination/dp/1585425524). The book helped me realize that my anxiety wouldn’t go away through browsing the internet. So I stopped sitting at my computer and took action!

I had a huge breakthrough when I started going to data science meetups and actually talking to people. Contrary to the picture of data scientists I had gotten from the internet, I found out that most data scientists are not experts in everything. I found out that with some persistence, I *could* learn how to code and train machine learning algorithms. My anxiety fell away like magic, and my inner game got so much better. I no longer gave up when I had some trouble with my code. I felt much more confident reaching out to employers.  Soon after, I found my first data science  internship (at a Meetup!), which turned into a full-time job.

So what’s my advice for the aspiring data scientists out there? Make sure your inner game is just as strong as your technical skills and your resume. You’ll need confidence and persistence and resilience if you want to become a data scientist. And you will need all of those traits when you finally *get* your first data scientist job, too. Best of luck, and please feel free to PM me if you have any questions.

personalfinance,27 years old with hefty debt and a poor credit score. I want to make this better. Detailed snapshot inside.,"Hi PF,

I've finally opened my eyes to how bad my financial situation is and attempting to make steps to improve it over the next few years/my life. I'm looking for advice, tough love and experience in dealing with these things.

**My Debts:**

* $6,100 on a personal credit card with 18% interest. 110% of credit utilized. $150 minimum monthly payment.
* $1,300 on an auto credit card with 0% interest for a few months. 90% credit utilized. $35 minimum monthly payment.
* $2,600 on an auto loan. $209 monthly minimum payment.
* $23k on student loans. Paying $117/month.
* I also now owe ~$700 to federal and local taxes.


**Income:**

* $36k annually. I work in marketing.
* I recently started working weekend shifts at a brunch restaurant, conservatively making about $180 per weekend.


**Savings:**

I have 0 money in a savings account or retirement plan.


**Budget:**

After taxes I am bringing home around $2,200 a month from my marketing job. I expect to be adding $720 a month from serving.

* I rent an apartment with my gf, each paying about $300/mo including utilities (cheap cost of living).
* I spend about $200/mo on food.
* Then paying the minimum payments on the debts I listed above, that's an additional $500/mo I am paying.
* Car insurance is $120/month, phone is $80/mo.


This leaves me with $1,000 left (not counting the serving job income, which I haven't realized yet as I'm in training still). I am living paycheck to paycheck, so should probably evaluate what I'm doing with that money.


**Credit:**

* My credit score is poor. 
* My extremely high credit utilization is hurting me. 
* I have a perfect payment history.
* I have 8 accounts in collections. 
7 accounts are with Alliance One and are from speeding camera tickets that I did not pay to my city. They are 6 separate collection accounts, each for $160. 
1 account is from medical billing. I was erroneously billed for some routine lab tests I had done, while I had insurance. The doctors office, had actually done this exact thing before, and after months of calling checking, I was able to have it correctly billed to my insurance and it was taken off my account. When it happened again, I tried and tried but nothing happened and I gave up. This bill is from a few years ago but the collection date is Dec '14.


I have recently started looking for a new apartment and realized I'm not going to have any luck if the landlord checks my credit.

---

What would you do if you were in my position? How bad off am I?

Can I do anything in terms of consolidating the debt, switching credit cards? Should I contact the collection agencies about my debt?

personalfinance,"The student loan problem for employees working in public interest, are married and hoping to save for retirement.","I have no idea how unique this situation is, but I am dying for an answer, and cannot figure it out. 

Both my wife and I have significant student loans and have been working in public interest careers for about five years.

Our careers qualify for the public interest federal student loan forgiveness program, whereby assuming we make 120 qualified monthly payments on the federal income-based repayment plan our loans will be forgiven. This works out to 10 years and we are a little less than half way there. 

However, the only way to keep our monthly student loan payments low is to file our taxes married but separate. This means that I do not qualify for a Roth IRA. I have a traditional IRA, but the contributions are not deductible due to my filing status and what we earn. 

My employer is nixing their contributions to my 401k... and the vanguard IRA I have is generally better performing. However, I feel like making non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA doesn't make sense. Should I just be using the 401k my employer provides?

What am I missing? I have no idea what to do. I honestly feel like getting a divorce makes the most financial sense.",finance,1434559010
personalfinance,Finally looked at my retirement account and I'm not sure what to do.,"I am currently self-employed and when I am unable to meet my financial obligations for the month, my husband covers the funds needed. Food, shelter, utilities, etc. is covered by husband. We live in the country in the U.S. My job prospects are better now since we have a better internet provider and I can actually do remote work without hitting a data cap or being throttled.

**Debt**

1. Private student loans current total of $7,953.98. 
2. Stafford Loans current total $32,417.30.
3. Perkins Loan current total $2,522.20.

All accounts are up to date. We have a small amount of CC debt that is paid off each month (we use it for the Amazon points) and $11,000 in savings. There is no other debt, such as a mortgage or car loans.

**Retirement Account**

The account is under a state-funded retirement account from a job I previously worked at in a different state before we moved so my husband could pursue his dream of being a farmer (3rd generation, whoop!).

Details of the retirement account:

1. As of Dec 2014, I have $6,945.34.
3. 2014 interest earned was $260.14 and I think that my interest rate is 1.75% based on my service credit?
4. I have to make a decision within five years of leaving employment as it will stop earning interest. I left this job in January of 2014 and I do not intend on moving back.
5. The pamphlet says I have three options. (1) I leave my contributions and allow it to earn interest until January of 2019 and then do something. (2) Roll my contributions over into a tax-sheltered plan like a 457(b) deferred compensation plan, 403(b) annuity, an IRA, or a qualified retirement plan with a new employee (nope). I don't know what most of those mean or which one would be the best. (3) Have the account paid out and pay the taxes and penalty for early withdrawal.

I'm kind of torn on what to do. On one hand, I'd like to pay down my student debt as quick as possible and this money could help me eliminate my Perkins loan and a portion of my private student loans or my Stafford loans.

On the other hand, I don't want to end up like either of my parents with no type of retirement plan in place. So I'm leaning towards rolling my account over to a different type of retirement account and letting it sit forgotten until I'm at the age of retirement.

Advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!",finance,1434560744

When purchasing a condo what is the difference between a limited review and a full review.  In my situation I have an offer on a condo that was accepted.  The mortgage broker I'm talking to said that recently (2013 and 2014) mortgages were denied in the complex because the builder still owns 10% of more of the condos.  He said that he can use a different lending company that will be a slightly higher interest rate but they don't require any kind of review (limited or full).  Is this still a good idea?  I planned on putting 20% down with a 30-year fixed.  What could be the drawbacks of going with a company that doesn't do a review?  Will I have trouble selling it at a later date?  (Will the mortgage go through?)  It's not in my plans to move again any time soon but you never know what could happen.  Can I still get a mortgage approved if I decide to not do 20% down/30-year fixed?  My offer to the seller which was signed and accepted said I plan on doing 20% down/30-year fixed.

personalfinance,My wife and I are $57k in debt. We want to save and rebuild what little credit we have.,"Two years ago my credit was terrible. Like, low 500's terrible. I got a secured card with a very low limit and got to work. Months pass, my credit limit increases. I get excited and max it out. Immediately realizing it was a bad idea, I vow to myself to not do it again and I try to pay more than the minimum every month. Usually 2-3x the minimum. Somewhere along the way I got way off course and started using it and maxed it out again. I make the minimum payments, but nothing more.  
A few more months pass, my car is falling apart and I got new car fever. I walked onto the lot, pointed at a truck I liked, and said I want to buy that one. I promptly signed papers without a second thought. In the end I'm paying $32k @ 16% over 6 years.   
A few months pass and times are getting hard (no doubt because of my $700/mo truck note). I got another credit card and promptly maxed it out.  
Fast-forward another couple of months. Times are even harder. My wife and I each get another card. We've been paying bills with our credit cards. Now we're at the end of our rope. All of our cards are maxed.  

This is our current breakdown:  
Amazon Card:      $672.62  
Capital One #1:    $646.35  
Capital One #2:    $909.47  
Chase:                 $1942.17  
USAA:                 $894.05  
Student Loans:     ~12,000  
Truck:                  ~30,000 (I'm upside-down ~7k)  
Car:                     ~10,000  
Plus roughly $400 in medical debt that collection companies are harassing us for.  

We also owe $1k on a Boy Scout trip that my son and I are going on in a month (I'd back out of this if I could but the troop has already paid everything on my word that we were going, so at this point I'm paying them back). My wife wants us to try to get a personal loan to pay off the hospital bills to keep them off our credit, as well as to pay off the trip. I think it's a terrible idea but I don't see an alternative. 
I want to let my truck go back for the sake of our sanity but that's a lose-lose situation for multiple reasons.  
1) It negatively impacts my credit  
2) I lose a vehicle that we need to have since we both have jobs  
3) I feel like (even more of) a failure

personalfinance,Opening a second savings account at another bank? Or...,"Hi! First time actually posting here; sorry if I sound totally uninformed or end up rambling.

Right now, I have one credit card, one savings account, and one checking account, and they are all through Discover. I like the convenience of this, being able to consolidate my cashback bonus and easily transfer money and pay my credit card. I'm 23 if that makes a difference.

I am aware that Ally bank offers a savings account that has a 0.09% higher interest rate, and I currently have several goals that I am saving towards (3 to be exact). It sometimes seems a little confusing to be pooling all my savings and money for these goals into one account, so I've been looking into getting another savings account to keep things separated.

My questions for you: Is this a good idea? Is Ally a good choice? Should I be considering different short term savings options instead? 

I've been very good at budgeting my money and making sure all my bills get paid, but I sometimes struggle with saving (putting most of my ""extra"" money into student loans currently) and all the options that are out there, especially with so many different goals (emergency fund, loans, retirement, new car, etc.) so any advice outside of answers to the questions is also greatly appreciated!",finance,1434570647
personalfinance,Financing Home Renovations on New Home,"**Background**

My wife and I just purchased a home in our perfect location for $525k, knowing that we were going to be making substantial improvements to the home. We did this to avoid the bidding wars on nice-looking (but still requiring considerable updating) homes that are driving prices 20-30% over asking into the $750-950k(!) range.

We had just paid off my student loans before deciding (probably prematurely) that we wanted to buy a house, so we were left with a down payment of about 15%. We ended up putting 5% down since we were stuck paying PMI anyway, thereby preserving our cash reserves in case we couldn't secure funding for the renovation work. Since we're planning to do the work in the first few months, a home equity line of credit would only allow us to borrow back what we had put in as a down payment and that's IF we could find one that would loan 90-100% of the equity.



**So the current plan is this:**

Take out a personal line of credit. Use said line of credit to cover costs of renovation above and beyond what we can afford to pay in cash (while preserving an emergency fund). Construction (and therefore first payments, are likely to be a few months out, shortening the time we would be paying interest on the personal line of credit). In one year when we are eligible to borrow against the new appraised value of the home, have the house appraised and take out a home equity loan based on the new equity to pay off the personal line of credit at a lower, tax-deductible interest rate.

*Does* *this* *plan* *make* *sense?* *Are* *we* *being* *irrationally* *hasty?*

**Pertinent info:**

Pretax income: $20k/mo

Retirement contributions: ~12%/mo

Mortgage (tax and PMI, etc included): $3k/mo

Net Savings (after all expenses inc mortgage): ~$4k/mo

Credit Score (pulled at time of mortgage): 797

1. Make enough money to survive

I am lucky enough to have joint custody, so I have my child two days a week and every other weekend. I currently have a full-time job, which is not working for school.

  This is my first time posting here and I appreciate any advice you guys might have about my move to Canada.
My fiance and I have just returned from a trip to look for places to live in Toronto. We have both accepted jobs there.  We live in NYC, and were very excited about the increased quality of life and so on, for the money, compared to where we are now.  
However, I'm realizing some financial challenges that moving to Canada will bring.
I'm finishing my PhD in July. I have been in higher ed for 10 yrs and have $50k of student loan debt.  About half of it is subsidized.  To be able to follow my fiance, I took a kind of low paying post doc at a university in Toronto.  I have a 9-month contract at $41k.  If things go according to plan, the year after next I will start a tenure track job, making more (~$80-90k), but that is not certain now.

Does anyone have any advice  for how to proceed in paying off my US student loan debt with my Canadian money?  The exchange rate is not in my favor, as of today I have to make $1.22 CA dollars to pay $1 US dollar back and projections indicate the CA dollar will continue to drop. Further, I may (?) have to pay to exchange that.  Is there a smart way to go about this?  This also doesn't even touch the issue of consolidating all of the loans, some of which have different interest rates.

I am a US citizen who quit her US job in August 2014, moved to New Zealand in September, and began working in New Zealand in November. I had an accountant in the US handle filing my taxes for me. I reported my foreign bank statements and everything else requested of me per my job, income, and New Zealand taxes I've paid as well.

My understanding of working abroad as a US citizen is very rough, but from what I know as long as I'm earning less than USD 90k p.a. (which I am earning less than that), then Uncle Sam would not tax me double on my foreign earnings. Additionally, until just a month ago (post-US tax season), I never utilized my New Zealand savings account. Everything went into Checking and no interest was accrued.

My accountant prepared my forms and estimated a ~$1700 federal tax refund, but I recently got a new letter saying that this has been adjusted to ~$1500 due specifically to ""foreign earned income."" I realize $200 may sound like pennies to most people but having this taken away from me just because I'm overseas is irritating to say the least.

I'd just like to know if anyone knows anything extra about this. The letter gives information for me to pursue if I'd like to challenge the adjustment.

personalfinance,"32 years old, planning to return to school full-time in the fall. Looking for advice.","This is more of an all-over-the-place rant/catharsis than a plea for help, but if anyone reading it feels inclined to share personal experiences or advice of any kind it would be great.

As the title said, I'm turning 32 next month and have finally decided it's time to quit fucking around and go back to school full-time.  I've spent the last few years taking online courses (1-2/semester) at my local CC, thinking I'd eventually transfer to the State Uni that is *literally* down the street.

**History**

I did very well in HS, mostly due to the relentless prodding of my single mother who is currently the Dean of Graduate Studies for a dept. in aforementioned local Uni.  Top 20 in my class, 3.8 GPA, 1400 SAT (back when it went to 1600), etc.  *But*, when I got to college, the new found freedom took over and I washed out, fast.  Moved back home and got a job as a waiter.  Around 2004, I started CC classes and, again, never went to class, lots of F2's and NS's on my transcript.  Academia was and never will be for me, it seems.  Got A's and B's in all the classes I actually showed up for, but they were far outnumbered by the ones I didn't.

Fast-forward 10 years and I'm still working in the service industry, but have worked my way up to Sous Chef in a very reputable and award-winning restaurant.  It's not a bad job, *per se*, but the salary ceiling in this industry is relatively low, ownership risk is incredibly high, benefits are rare, and the hours are... terrible.

**Present**

I'm currently earning a salary of $40k/yr, working 45-70 hours/week depending on the season.  My fiancee works as the front of house manager in the same restaurant (we met first, she introduced me to the owner and he immediately started courting me for the position), and makes about $2300/month.  We've been engaged now for 2 years because work always seems to manage to come first, we work opposite schedules, and are both already married to the restaurant that we basically run for someone else, yada yada yada.  The stress of planning a wedding is just too much for either of us to handle.

I own a small (~900 sq.ft.) condo in a *meh* neighborhood close to downtown that I bought in 2007 with the inheritance when my grandparents died.  Our mortgage+HOA fees are $600/month.  I'd like to move us to a bigger house with a yard and a nice neighborhood, and eventually have some kids and do the whole nuclear family thing, but we're fine here for at least a few more years.

Anyway, I've decided to ditch the idea of trying to transfer into the Business School at the University, and want to enroll in an AAS program that will get me on track for a new career ASAP.  We live in the RTP area of NC, so tech jobs are abundant and there is constant construction and expansion.  It just feels like a technical degree is the best way to go at this point, and I want to get the schooling over and done with.  I've been juggling back and forth between Comercial/Residential Electrician or something in IT, either IT Security or Network Admin.  I loathe the idea of being stuck at a desk all day, and love working with my hands.  I'm very mechanically inclined, logical, etc.  Past fleeting hobbies have been building tube amplifiers, gaming PCs, guitars, and working PT as an ""audio engineer"" doing live sound and recording/demos for my friends' bands.  I've been ""the computer guy"" at every job I've ever had (restaurants need IT, too!)

The toss-ups for me are:

Electrician:  Would probably love the work.  However, at 32, I wouldn't be earning a Journeyman's salary until I was probably in my 40s, trying to keep up with the young guys on the job site.  The hours would be a bit better for a family life, but I would probably spend a few years after school just getting back to my current salary level, and the long term earnings potential is below what I'd like to eventually (end of career salary) be earning.

ITSec/NetAdmin:  Would probably enjoy working on networks more, as I consider myself much more of a ""hardware guy"" than a ""software guy"".  The starting salaries for either of these jobs are the same if not significantly more than what I currently earn, and the long-term earning potential is **WAY** higher.  However, competition is stiff and I could get out of school and end right back up in a kitchen!

***THE MONEY***

Assets:

Current income: ~$40,000/yr

Savings: $6000 in a Credit Union Money Market

IRA: currently contributing ~$250/month to a Vanguard Target 2050.

Credit Cards:  ~$20k in available credit, currently ~$2000 outstanding spread over 5 accounts, half on a card that won't charge interest until this October.

Savings Bonds: $19,000 in four E-Series bonds, two of which haven't matured yet.  Would rather not use these for school, as I can sit on them for a few more years until they mature and have nice addition to the proceeds from the condo to put towards a larger down payment on a new house.

Expenses:

Mortgage+HOA: $600/mo., split evenly

Utilities: ~$300/month, split evenly

Groceries: ~$250/month, split.  Fiancee is doing weightwatchers, so this will not go down.

Entertainment: ~$200/month.  We don't go out much, but we work really hard and treat ourselves accordingly when we do.  This can go down.

I haven't told my employer about my plans yet, as mine is not a position that can just ""drop back to PT"".  I know that he'll understand, but I really do run a large portion of his business for him and if I give him too much notice, I fear he'll phase me out before I can afford it.  He's still the Executive Chef, and my job is essentially to make it so that he doesn't have to spend as much (if any, really) time running the kitchen, scheduling, payroll, inventory, dealing with vendors, making specials, etc.  It will be a very big blow to him, and I do care about him and his business, but I just can't be stuck at $40k for the rest of my life, he can't afford to pay me much more, and I need to get a career with a more ""normal"" work schedule.

Because of my previous go-rounds at school, my GPA is currently too low for me to receive Financial Aid, so I'm looking into Federal loans.  At this point, it looks like a full-time semester's tuition and books will be around $2000.  That, plus more frugal living, I estimate that I'll need around $5000 per semester.  I'd rather not work at all for my first semester, just to make sure I can fully focus on school.  I've already fulfilled all of my gen-ed and elective requirements, so I'll be jumping straight into the courses directly related to my field of study, and I want to blow them out of the water.

personalfinance,Is it better to pay off small dollar student loans first or the large dollar? Or does it make no difference?,"I have some extra money and am gainfully employed. Instead of letting all of it sit in my saving account earning practically no interest, I was thinking of paying down some loans. I have one that only has $200 left and others that range from $5000-$9000. 


Both have the same interest rate of 6.8%. 

Would it be better to kill the $200 loan or should I apply that amount to one of the larger loans? My thinking is that, if I kill the smaller loan, it will no longer be accumulating any interest, which might be better than lowering the interest of a larger one.

I stand to halve the interest rate but I don't know how this would affect my credit. Would taking on that much debt (double my student loan) hurt? Or might repaying them under my own name help? I plan on taking out an auto loan next year and I'm concerned about DTI.

Fiverr gigs

photo2Aside from my main side hustle (freelance SEO services) I have been trialling some other online platforms including Fiverr. My latest gig? I will say your message and do a backflip. This alternative video greeting gig isn’t going to make me a millionaire but I can complete a single gig in just 10mins which theoretically provides an hourly rate of $24-$48 per hour (depending on the gig extras as some gigs pay double). I can certainly see how listing more gigs like this could provide a steady side income which provides plenty of opportunity to scale this revenue stream in the future.

The secret? – Utilise gig extras and only list gigs on Fiverr that you can complete in 15mins or less to ensure your hourly rate remains high!

Writing college overviews

Bio-Shot-HeadshotBeing a writer by heart, my side hustles have typically been writing gigs of one kind or another.  There have been both some boring and interesting ones along the way.  In one case, I had to write overviews of more than 200 colleges and universities for an online directory based in California.  I earned (a whopping) $.02 per word, or about $8 per 400-word article.  Lots of coffee inspired me through those articles.  Another time, I worked for a law office summarizing depositions.  The attorney was deposing the mechanic, pilot, and accident reconstruction specialist involved in the crash of a small propeller plane, which was pretty interesting.

Making jingles and websites for companies

listen money mattersIt’s all about digging deep within yourself and asking, “what am I good at?” For me, it’s doing creative work like designing websites and writing songs.

I spent a lot of time just designing websites and writing songs for myself and putting my work out there for all to see. There’s a great book called Show Your Work which talks about this very thing. After a few weeks, I started getting contacted to design websites and making jingles for companies. I was able to sell all my creative services for more than $1,000 a job.

When work started to die down, I drove around in my car and found local businesses that I was familiar with and asked them if they needed any of my services. I was bringing in more than $3,000 a month just doing what I was good at, and what I was doing for fun already.

Nowadays, I turn down work because I just don’t have the time. I also charge a lot more for my services because I see the value in what I can do for people. The real challenge is pricing. I read another book called Book Yourself Solid, which opened my eyes to my true worth and got me the clients that I truly wanted to work with, without sacrificing my income.

Sign up bonuses

Kim-Parr-2The easiest side hustle that I’ve done recently is opening bank accounts that offer a bonus. I don’t sign up for ones that require too many hoops to get the payout, like direct payroll deposit or a ton of money as a minimum daily balance. I have signed up for accounts with Capital One, US Bank, and TD Ameritrade. All of these only required a minimum deposit and something simple like making a set number of debit card transactions or paying a few bills online. You do have to keep the account open for a certain amount of time, usually 6 months. The husband and I have snagged about $600 over the past year. It isn’t a huge amount of money, but for the time invested, it’s a pretty good return. We only use money that would be sitting in a savings account anyway, so it’s nice to get a little bit back to make up for the low interest rates.

personalfinance,"[Budgeting] US-Recent college grad, looking for budgeting help","Hello,

I recently graduated college and moved to Chicago from a smaller town.  I thought I had a lot saved up, but a check to my bank balance (I know, I really should check this regularly), revealed I only have about $3,500.  This was quite shocking to me.  Should a person who just graduated have more than this?

Here are my current known expenses:

* ~$650/month on Rent+Utilities
* ~$175/month on gasoline
* ~$20 on internet
* ~$120/month on public transit     
* ~$70/month on my cell phone bill
* ~$30/month medication
* ~$50/month health/life insurance
*  No idea on what to budget for food.  Any thoughts on how much a single guy spends on groceries?

I was also planning to contribute ~$225/month to 401k for now. 

My car insurance is taken care of for the first few months by my dad.  Those expenses listed above are my non-negotiable expenses.  

Monthly income will be ~$3,700 before taxes.  I'm not sure what my federal and state taxes will be, but I'd guess my take home pay would be like 75% of that, so $2,750.  Fair estimate?

That sounds like a healthy income surplus, but for some reason I'm stressed out still that I don't have a large enough savings. It's probably because I have so much less money than I thought.

  I suppose my goal is to increase my savings so I have a solid emergency fund, but I don't know how much that should be.

personalfinance,"I'm using neither the avalanche or snowball method, is there a name for this strategy?","Following graduate school and the birth of my first child I realized that despite my ability to  pay my monthly bills, I was staring down the barrel of significant amount of total debt across MANY accounts.  This included some credit cards, undergrad loans, grad loans, personal loans, auto bills, and medical bills (basically the cost to get through my program while working minimally).  

I always found myself able to make payments, but strapped for 2-3 days until the next paycheck (semi-monthly, UGH).  Neither the snowball or avalanche approach offered little in the way of short term relief as they tend to provide max benefit with regard to interest paid or psychologically after paying an entire balance off.

I have been paying off debt steadily, making more rapid progress than I initially calculated by paying off debts with a focus on monthly payment in relation to total balance.  I do not entirely disregard interest, however it is a secondary factor.  For example I had 2 similar balances from different providers with varying terms and conditions.  I had:

Discover Student Loan:  $1145 remaining balance, 6.0% interest, $32 / month

Laser Eye Credit Card:  $1150 remaining balance , 0% interest 24 months, $141 / month

Assuming I had $1150 in cash to pay, the consensus seems to always be to pay off the highest interest rate no matter what.  However in this case the $1150 is best suited to eliminate a debt which cannot be ""recharged"" AND frees up an extra $141 / month.   The ratio of balance to payment for the student loan was .02 and for the Laser Eye card was .12.  I have noticed most major and consumer retail cards only have .01 as the minimum payment or $25, whichever is higher.

For someone like myself, or those of you who have MANY different accounts with smaller to medium individual balances, completely eliminating the highest payment relative to overall balance was much more effective in freeing up cash to pay for other accounts.  Generally any card/loan over .04 got my immediate attention.

My realization was that I could pay $500 on my BOA balance every month because it was the highest interest rate, pay $500 to eliminate my lowest account balance that only had a minimum payment of $25, or I could put $500 on an account that I could finish off next month and eliminate a $150 payment.  I also applied extra preference to accounts that fit this criteria that could not be recharged ie student loans or my laser eye card.

personalfinance,Quick credit card question.,"My wife is paid at the beginning of the month and I have a part time gig that does payments every other week. Our goal is to get our financials in something of an order this year. Pay down some CC debt, make a budget, and we have been mostly successful. We have cut up one credit card and will be working on another. Those are store specific cards (boo high interest rates). But we still have trouble sticking to a budget and as a result are sometimes surprised by bills coming through autopay.

My idea was in order to keep from having bill autopay surprises in our checking account, what if we got a CC that had enough room to have all autopay bills come off that. My idea was then we could have it be paid off (automatically) at the beginning of each month when my wife is paid. My wife is too busy, and I'm not great at manually managing our money to be sure we will make it through the month with money to save right now. Know what we have for the rest of the month may make it easier. Also reward points.

So my question is A) decent idea? And B) what CC would be recommended? I was thinking just going through our bank if there wasn't anything special.",finance,1434602213

The country is famous because of its countless software companies that are dealing in the business of software outsourcing. Business organizations from different parts of the world are forming work alliances with India due to their excellent performance and perfect time management. Countless highly qualified software professionals are involved that make software outsourcing in India an amazing business resolution.

There are many countries that are making remarkable progress in offering the facility of software outsourcing where the most important factor for this popularity is the presence of great manpower at economic charges but Indian outsourcing companies quote their charges according to the projects, the number of employers recruited for completing that project and also  acknowledge the use of english language on great level .The owner can also stay in direct contact with his associated outsourcing providers through the medium of internet.

Technology is developing and introducing new software’s for better implementation of work. For owner it is not an easy task to track the development so the software developers are more focused on the mechanism of the company rather than following the recent technologies. They only inform the business organisation about the software’s but don’t teach the mechanism and implementation.This reduces the requirement and expenses of interpreter. Therefore selecting the option of software outsourcing in india is an intelligent idea.

So at last one should not forget the fact that software outsourcing in india is not free from irresponsible attitude and fraud services providers. Hence it is important for the owners to research and make inquiry about the service provider who has gained affiliation with registered institute.The confedential data and documents should be shared between the client and the vendor so that no information should get misused.",finance,1434628751

personalfinance,My SO wants to pay off all of my high interest student loans with his low interest med school line of credit.,"Hi personal finance,

My boyfriend just got into med school, and here in Canada (not sure how it is in the US) he gets access to a $275,000 line of credit- from what I understand, with a prime interest rate (2.5%), that only starts accruing interest when he spends it.

I currently have approx. $60,000 of U.S. student loans for undergrad and grad school, which I will be finishing soon. Right now these loans are accruing about $7.50 a day in interest- once my 6 month waiting period post-graduation is up, my plan was to consolidate and get a little more time, then I will be paying about $500/month.

My boyfriend wants to pay off my loans in their entirety using his line of credit, so that we have a lower interest rate and save more money in the long run. I would then pay what I could out of my salary towards this sum while he is going through med school, with the goal being to get rid of it as fast as possible.

I know there will be comments/questions about our relationship- we have been together for 1.5 yrs (25 &amp; 26), are moving in together and are in it for the long haul. However, we would definitely sign a legal document before going through with any of this. I'm the one still hesitating about this plan, while my boyfriend wants to do it asap. Beyond the relationship (still be interested in comments about that too), are there any financial downsides to this?

EDIT** Just to clarify, the line of credit is not a student loan- it can be used for anything, from housing to travel. It's really just for living expenses while you're in med school.",finance,1434635550

personalfinance,Buy here pay here closing and selling my account to a finance company.,"Hi, PF!  Throwaway because a few people know my username and don't really want them to know this particular situation.

I am young and divorced, was also unemployed for a while.  I ended up losing everything I had, which then took my credit to hell with it.  I defaulted on credit cards, had to break a lease, my car was repossessed-- the works. (Still trying to clean all of that up)

Paid cash for my previous car but totaled it.  Used the insurance payout to put a down payment on my current car at a BHPH.  The interest rate is high (20something%).  I can easily afford the payment.

Here's where my question comes in.  The dealership is now closing.  it's up for sale.  As soon as it sells, all accounts will be sold to a finance company-- one that *does* report on credit.  In the next month or two I will have the money to pay it off.  Is it worth it to keep making a few payments until it goes to the finance company so that it will reflect positively on my credit and then pay it off after a few months, or should I just go ahead and pay it off now?

economy,"Rep David Cicilline of Ohio. ""TPA doesnt stand for Trade Promotion Authority it stands for Taking Prosperity Away""!","""The house should reject this proposal- we have had *30 years of bad trade policy* that has been bad for American workers.""

He's right, the trade deals we have had up until now have all preceded drops in trade with the countries we have in the deals. 

They really do need TAA, because TISA will impact federal, state and local workers, including teachers. It has rules like those in GATS which require the privatization of services.

You can read the two part test TISA and TTIP uses, of what ""services"" have to be privatized here: 

""For the purposes of this Agreement…

(b) 'services' includes any service in any sector *except services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority;*

***(c) 'a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority' means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers.""***

--- end quote-----


Most putative services  alleged to be ***""supplied in the exercise of governmental authority""***  in fact, FAIL the second part - (Article I:3 (c) ) so they have to be privatized.

This use of the WTO [services agreement's framing](http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6891-2013-ADD-1-DCL-1/en/pdf) in deciding what to piratize is rightfully a matter of extreme [global concern](http://www.ictsd.org/downloads/2008/06/cassim_steuart_part3.pdf). because the deal they are trying to sneak in via the back door was really controversial, it caused the WTO talks to collapse two, arguably three times. Its an attack on public services we all need. WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?

For example, this [statement from the 850 member European University Association](http://www.eua.be/Libraries/Publication/EUA_Statement_TTIP.sflb.ashx)

They wont just be privatized and given to contracting companies. Those companies could be from any place in the globe. [Whomever is the low bidder](http://www.cuts-geneva.org/pacteac/images/Documents/EAC%20Forum/Forum17/EAC%20Geneva%20Forum-%20WTO%20Note%2017.pdf)

Its not clear what the wage would be, or if it would need to be paid in the US, and subject to US rules. The companies from other countries will likely pay them as they always have, where or how they always have. 

In the near future they also - according to the mandate documents, if the monetary amount of the contract exceeds a certain [threshold](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/thresh_e.htm), they will need to be procured via the revised WTO GPA system, a global computer system.",finance,1434638867

personalfinance,CapitalOne 360 Has removed 5-day Wait Period on Most Deposits and transfers!,"Their long availability times have annoyed me for a long time now. Glad to see they're getting with the times. Here's the full text of the announcement:

&gt; Good news – you’ve been asking for faster access to deposits for 360 Checking® and MONEY accounts, and as of June 3, 2015, you’ve got it. Plus, starting July 18, 2015, you’ll be able to deposit cash and checks at Capital One Bank® locations. Here’s the scoop:

&gt; 	**Quicker availability**: Most check deposits to 360 Checking and MONEY accounts are now available the next business day after we receive them – regardless of how you deposit the check. (Yep, this also applies to any deposits made through your mobile phone or computer.)

&gt; 	**Shortened hold times:** There may still be some instances where deposits are on hold after the next business day, but now those hold times will be no longer than 5 business days. If we do place a hold on your deposit, we’ll give you a heads-up.

&gt; 	**Faster processing**: If you request money transfers from another bank by 5 PM ET on business days, those transfers now begin processing on the same day you schedule them. (Any transfers requested after 5 PM ET or on non-business days will begin processing on the next business day.) In most cases, your money will be available no later than 2 business days after that.

&gt; 	**Deposits at Capital One Bank locations**: Beginning July 18, 2015, you can make deposits in a Capital One Bank, and you’ll be able to make withdrawals and cash checks there, too. If you cash checks from another bank, we may need to hold the same amount of funds based on our deposit timelines.
&gt; Oh, and one more thing. Because everyone loves a little more flexibility, we’re removing this clause from our Terms and Conditions in August: ’Under Federal law, we must reserve the right to require you to give us at least 7 days written notice before you take money out of your account.’
&gt; 
&gt; We hope you enjoy having faster access to your money. To see the details of these changes, check out the ’Deposit Availability Disclosure’ section of the updated 360 Checking and MONEY Terms and Conditions.",finance,1434642810
financialindependence,Becoming FI with...Solar panels.,"Hey all, I had a great experience with switching to solar power this past year.  I had the units installed in December and the local utility gave me the okay to turn the panels on in January.  

My average cost for power went down $100 per month.  Even better...the company I went with (Solar City) offers a solar loan program.  Paying for it feels like a lease (it's a 30-year loan at 4.5% with $0 down), but I own the system and still got my 30% federal credit when I did my taxes this year.  That gave us an extra $10k to invest now, which I did instead of paying down the loan (it would have reduced my kwh rate...investing was better).  When my system is paid off, I could be net positive on my power, since my kids will be moved out and we'll use less power.  

For me, it was a good decision for FI.  I don't plan on moving out of my house and my utility costs were over $200/month.  With inflation, that would be a pretty substantial cost in 30 years, which I won't need to have 300 times the cost of saved for retirement! That could be as much as $100k! Not to mention the environment, and stuff.  

Any one else with a similar experience?  Other changes like this for long term benefit towards FI?  Did I have a blind spot on this one?",finance,1434644116
personalfinance,[Debt] My loan co-signer is dying and I'm leaving my job.,"Welp. The summer before my junior year of college I had a falling out with my parents. I couldn't find anyone to co-sign my loan until the last possible day when my boyfriend's stepfather offered to sign. I pushed back, but in ended up accepting their offer. 

Fast forward 6 years. I have a BA in Journalism and have had steady work and marketable skills. The boyfriend and I broke up but are still good friends, his mother divorced the stepfather, and he's now on a  slow decline into inevitable death. It's a waiting game, his condition has no improvement and no cure. The total I owe the NJ Class Loan company is $61k, with $16k of it being the loan the stepfather signed for. 

I am in a position where I am leaving my job to pursue other things, but don't have anything concrete yet. My employment ends mid July. Yes it's dumb to leave without a job lined up, but the situation is unavoidable. I'll have around $1,500 in savings by then. 

I'll be moving back home and won't have rent to pay, but also have a phone bill, car insurance, and $5,000 in credit card debt that I have been paying down. I have health insurance thanks to my parents until the end of the year when Obama's grace is up.

Since my loan is private, they don't offer any income based payment plans. I called to ask what my options are, and was told I could switch to a quarterly payment of $900 and a monthly $70. 

How am I supposed to pay this if I have no income? They also have a loan consolidation plan, but it would make the payment time 30 years instead of 20. What does that mean for the interest, and monthly amount? As it is, I've been paying $648 a month to NJ Class and $235 a month to my federal loans. The total student loan debt I have is around $91k.

I'm not using this as an excuse, but I have a math learning disorder (Dyscalculia) and it's really difficult for me to understand math concepts. Please don't belittle me or call me dumb, I'm already in an anxious state and need actual advice. The job hunt has been OK, but I've left the field of journalism and don't know what I should be doing next...so that's another story. I've been working as an office manager for the past 2 years trying to figure out my next step and the environment is not fitting. I'm very unhappy in this job. 

When a cosigner dies, does the responsibility stay on me or does an estate take it over? I don't know if the stepdad's family knows about this...nor have I spoken to the stepfather in years. I'm really concerned over what this means and what the estate is capable of.",finance,1434644636

I am a young male working in R&amp;D at a chemical company salaried at approx $73k. I have perused the wiki and believe that my finances are in OK shape - but I'm hoping for wisdom and advice on how to make them better!
My finances, in the order specified by the wiki:
Step 0: ""Budget and reduce expenses, set realistic goals.""
Income = $4000
Expenses
• Rent = $920
• Credit cards = $1250 (no debt)
• Other = $50
• Emergency Savings = $1000 [$7.7k out of $15k goal]
• Company 401k = Invested automatically before paycheck [$13k vested, $28k overall]
• Car Payments (5.3% int) = $900 [$4.4k remaining]
• IRA = on hold. [$15k balance]
• Higher Education Savings = on hold.
• Life/Travel Savings = on hold.
Step 1: ""Build an Emergency Fund""
Current balance of $7.7k, I want to get it to $15k for 6months living expenses safety. Saving with Barclays Online Savings (1.00% int.). Will likely move $5k into a CD when I hit $15k.
Step 2: ""Employer-sponsored matching funds""
Employer matches 80% of my 5% pre-tax 401k contribution. Vested at $13k, $28k total.
Step 3: ""Pay down high interest rate debts""
$4400 car loan at 5.3% interest. I am required to pay $193/mo. I pay $900/mo.
Step 4a: ""Saving for retirement in IRA""
I was saving $400/mo but stopped recently to up my contribution to Emergency Fund and pay down my car loan.
Step 4b: ""Higher education expenses""
I am considering going back to school at some point to get a higher degree (masters most likely) in psychology or similar. This may lead to a more fulfilling career as it is in line with my passions. Short term financial returns may be lower with this strategy. I want to be able to understand the financial implications first.
Step 5: ""Save more for retirement""
N/A
Step 6: ""Save for other goals""
In 3-5 years I suspect that I will be interested in taking some time off from working ""full time"" and travel. I hope to be able to save up for this life event so that I do not need to dip too deeply into my emergency fund to do so.

I have made important contacts in the university as far as references go and I feel I have my ducks in a row for when I seek employment. I have looked into where I am planning on moving to, which is 6 hours from my hometown, and the job market is MUCH BETTER than anywhere in the area am I presently living and the cost of living is only slightly higher, which is offset by wages there.

I said all of that to say this: should I take out more in student loans to finance this car? I am not expecting to have very much in student loan debt from school, at less than $10,000, and I know that no other loan will give me the opportunity of low interest rates *and* a 6 month grace period. As an aside, I currently have about $1500 in savings.

Is this a good idea given my employment prospects, current finances, and current situation? I think it is, my mom thinks so too, but my dad is definitely a ""bear"" type (think stock market, not gay men) and has stated that I ""don't know for sure I'll even have a job when I graduate.""

gaming,What I feel happened with Metroid Prime Federation Force.,"With all the backlash on the recently announced ""Metroid"" game, I can't help but be reminded of a choice Nintendo recently made that almost mirrors this, and thus worked to their advantage.

Various Nintendo creators have been quoted as saying they came very close to tying Splatoon into the Mario universe just to bring his brand recognition to the game, but later decided against it and took the bolder move of making it a completely new IP.

I feel like that is exactly what happened here, minus the part where they realized shoehorning a game into an existing IP won't instantly bring it popularity. Had this simply been revealed as Federation Force, and presented itself as an original experience, I don't believe any of this backlash would have taken place.",technology,1434653418
personalfinance,"Assistance with my finance plan, please.","Hi /r/personalfinance. I appreciate any advice you can offer me regarding my financial situation.

I am a graduate student in a professional program. I have 1 year left before I graduate. I have amassed significant student loan debt over the years while attaining higher education. The good news is that I do have a plan to pay it off. I just want to make sure my plan is solid.


Here is the down low on my current situation:
**Income**: Varies from 500-1000 per month (I waitress part time around my schedule. I applied for work study position for fall '15. I use my student loan money to help with living cost)


**Rent**: $990.00/ month (high cost of living area, lease ends next year)
**Basic Expenses**: $300/ month  (ie: dog, food, household expenses)


**Debt**:
Credit cards:
*CapitalOne 2k @ 22% APR
*BankAmerica 1k @ 17% APR


Student Loans: 5 different lenders (1 private). None consolidated (I have no interest in consolidating atm). All deferred at the moment until I finish school and all in good standing.


*Sallie Mae- 8k @ 12% (private loan)
*Nelnet- 52k @ 6.8% (some unsubsidized, some unsub)
*ACS- 3k @ 2% (unsub/sub)
*SAF- 4k @ 2% (unsubsidized)
*Perkins-3500 @ 4%

**The plan**:
My professional program yields 100% employment following graduation, there is a high need for my field (speech pathology), and the state average wage is 72k per year. Realistically thinking, I assume I wont start off making the state average wage so I'm thinking my 1st year salary will be around 56k. A second job may be an option.


Fiance and I plan to use my 1st year salary and put it entirely toward my debt while we use his salary (55k) for our living expenses. My plan is to pay off credit cards first, and then knock out my student loans by highest interest rate first. I presently have no investment portfolio or retirement savings. I figure the best course of action is to pay off debt and then focus on saving/investment/retirement. Right now I feel like there isn't much I can do until I finish school. =/


Good plan or not? Is there a better plan/option?",finance,1434653484

personalfinance,New Job Offer,"So this is my first post after creeping here a bit. 
A bit about me, I'm 33, recently divorced(or soon to be), got a BS in Electrical Engineering and starting on my MS in the spring.

I'm closing on a two family house in south-central NH next week, I have 50k in private school loans that I'm chipping away at, got about 16k in CC debt, about 1/3 is 0% interest for the next 4 years, then my ex owes me approximately 7.5k, and of the revolving debt with interest I should be have paid off within the next 6 weeks. I know debt is evil, but divorce is expensive. So are spend-thrift ex wives...Anyways... Onto my question.

I work as a reliability and analytical design electrical engineer for an aerospace company. Solid work, lots of work, not worried about my position for the next 2 years or so at least. I'm bringing home 80k with 0 health care costs out of pocket, they also offer 401k matching of 50% up to 8% of my salary, profit sharing(usually about 5% of salary) invested, 10 vacation days, 5 sick days, and 10 holidays. This position is also in Mass, meaning I'll be paying mass income tax of 5.25%.

I have a federal job offer which is offering me 76k, but I'll have to pay health care costs out of pocket. This job is in NH so that means a much shorter commute(about half as long), and no mass income tax. 

So after my estimated health care(drawing costs from OPMs website), but the added mass income tax, and gas expenses... It's approximately a wash money wise. The federal job has 13 days of vacation a year, and 13 sick days...and that increases faster. I'll also be eligible for promotions and raises in a year vs 18 months for my current position. 

I'm unable to find any info about government match TSP(401k equivalent), the government does have the pension of 1% per year of working of your final 3 years... But pensions can disappear where as my current company's profit sharing won't.   

So I'm looking for opinions on whether I should stay or go. Thanks for the help.",finance,1434656842
personalfinance,I was encouraged to consolidate my student loans. What do you guys think?,"Hey, everyone. My loan servicer suggested I consolidate my 7 Direct Unsubsidized Stafford loans. Some background:

* Current principal of $64,343.38
* Current balance of $69,141.65
* 6% interest rate
* I enter repayment on 11/1/15
* I qualify for the PSLF
* Gross income of 105K 

Her main reasoning was that since I plan on buying a house in the next 10 years, consolidation will make it easier for me to take out a mortgage. Apparently having one consolidated loan makes me a better candidate in the lender's eyes rather than having several loans out. I'm not sure if there is any validity to that. Additionally, she was saying that since I qualify for the PSLF, consolidating my loans and doing an extended graduated repayment plan will ensure that I pay the lowest amount possible for those 10 years of repayment.

My grace period for all of my loans end tomorrow and I’m just trying to figure out what to do. I have no idea what I am doing, so if anyone could please lead me in the right direction or has any advice for me that would be so great. 


I have about eleven federal loans, ten from Great Lakes, a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized, and I have one parent plus loan, which is technically under my cosigner’s name but I will be responsible in paying it off. I also have six private loans. Three are from Sallie Mae with one (my highest loan with Salle Mae) at an interest at 8.88%, and two at 9.88%. The other three are from Wells Fargo with interest rates at 4.49%, 3.50%, and the highest loan being 3.25%.


Overall, I’m looking at over $135,000 in student loans (I know, what the fuck). I just found a job a month ago and am getting paid $13.50 part time, so between 25-30 hours a week. So, I’m not making nearly as enough as I should to pay this off. I have decided it would be best to go with an income based repayment plan for my ten Great Lakes loans and pay off like $50 per month. I’m going to start paying the Parent Plus loan off at a level of $55.69 per month. 


I have no idea what to do with my private loans. I was thinking to consolidate all six, but that number was staggering and cannot afford it. The interest rates on my Wells Fargo aren’t too bad, so I may just leave those alone and try and pay off $344.17 per month. That’s the number they gave me that I will be paying for 15 years. Does anyone know of any ways that I would be able to lower this number with Wells Fargo?


The three Sallie Mae loans, I am just lost with. Should I consolidate these or not? Should I defer them? With those, without consolidation, I’m looking at $752.1 per month. I cannot afford that. I don’t think Sallie Mae offers any payment plans either, so I am at a loss.

personalfinance,Question about credit cards/building credit,"Hi /r/personalfinance! I am a 20 year old college student in need of some guidance.

Some background: I do not have any student loans. I have about $11k in the bank: about $3k in stocks, $5k in my checking account, $2k in savings, and then $1100 held in escrow on a secured credit card ($1000 limit).
In the past 8 months I have gotten and paid off 2 car loans (co-signed with my mother). I initially got a loan of about $6k, then that car was totaled, and I got a $4k loan for the replacement car. Both loans were taken out with the intention of paying them back quickly, as I've accomplished. 

As I mentioned, I have had a secured credit card with a local credit union for about 9 months. I have $1100 with them for the card, as up until then I did not have a credit history. This card is only used for one subscription payment a month, ~$9. It has no fees and offers no rewards. I am using it to help build my credit. 

Here's where the dilemma is. I believe that I would now qualify for a student credit card with my bank (not the credit union) that offers rewards. It's a card geared toward students, and offers some rewards: each point is redeemable for ~$.01 for airline bookings (I fly fairly regularly, so this would be useful) or ~$.0067 for cashback. Additionally, it offers a lower interest rate than my current card (10% vs 17% I'm currently getting), though I always pay off the full amount at the end of each month.

So my question is, should I get this second credit card? My average age of credit is very low, and I've had quite a few hard credit checks recently due to all my activity. I'm not planning any large purchases for the foreseeable future, at least 3 years, but I'm not sure if this flurry of activity would hurt me down the road when I apply for other credit.

Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any and all guidance you have to offer.

TL;DR: Have one credit card, thinking about another. Not sure of the ramifications.",finance,1434668809
personalfinance,Advice on how to pay off student loans and setting some short term financial goals,"Hello,

Long time lurker, first time poster, here. I'm here because I have a few decisions to make and am looking for some sound advice. 

Here are the facts:

1. I graduated college in Dec 2013 with a Bachelor's in IT and have not been able to find a job in my field yet. As such, I am working for $8/hr + commission in retail and the job makes me want to kill myself but that is a story for another time.
2. My student loans, at the time of my writing this are at $30,404. To prevent having to worry about 4 different loan payments every month, I (regretfully) consolidated my loans with FEDLOAN for a rate of 4.75%. I have yet to set up auto-pay to drop that to 4.5%. My minimum payment every month is $201. I would not have been able to swing the minimum payments for four different loans and that is essentially why I consolidated.
3. My grandmother recently gave me money which she had set aside and was saving for me for my whole life in an account I was supposed to get upon her death but I was given it early to avoid any complications. After buying a car and getting it fixed up, I have about $17,000 left.

From here, I am trying to get a recommendation on the best course of action. I take home about $1,000/month and between my fixed (read bills) and variable expenses (gas, food), I have roughly $250 left at the end of the month although this is assuming I am only paying bills (minimum payment on loan) and buying just gas and groceries if I don;t buy a single other thing. I am living at home to avoid utilities and house payments.

My current plans are:

*  Paying off my installment bill amount remaining on my phone so I can leave Sprint and go to AT&amp;T prepaid. My plan with Sprint is $80. After paying off my phone (~$230), I will get port to AT&amp;T and get a prepaid SIM and pay $45/month instead, saving me $35 a month, with a net savings of $290 by the end of my contract with Sprint if I don't pay ahead on my phone.

* I just went ahead and canceled my XBOX Live membership.

* I'm planning to sell off some old things that I can make some money off of on Craigslist or something.

From here is where I need advice. I have figured about $5000 to be a safe amount for 6 months of expenses (with some wiggle room) which leaves me ~$12,000 to play with. I wanted opinions on taking either all of just some of the 12k and throwing it at the loan to drastically drop my payments so that then my $201 payments (or more) will end up with me paying quite above the new minimum. Or if I only use a portion of the 12k to pay the loan, what is my best coarse of action to take with the rest of the 12k I didn't put on the loan? I just want to take a course of action that will ultimately help me without a ton of risk involved as this is all the money I have and until I get a new job, money is quite tight.

I also have a secondary question: would it be a good idea to go ahead and get my first credit card with a limit of, say $500, and use that to pay my loan each month and then pay off the card each month and never use it for anything else aside from extreme emergencies for easy credit boosting? Right now I'm sitting at around a 650 credit score.

personalfinance,Advice needed - how to get rid of loads of debt on a teacher's salary,"Hello and sorry for the shit title.  My girlfriend and I have been talking about getting serious and moving in together, and in doing so I've learned that she has fairly significant debts through various channels.  I want to help her come up with a plan to address her finances but don't really know where to begin.  I'll try to summarize what I know, and if anyone has any advice I can pass along it would be much appreciated...

One. Income


GF brings home roughly $2,300 every month as a high school teacher.


Two. Expenses


Known expenses include rent, utilities, phone and internet (roughly $1,000 per month), car payment ($490 per month...see below), car insurance ($120 per month), and minimum payments on four separate credit cards ($300ish per month) as well as $200 per month toward a debt she owns her parents.  This leaves less than $200 for everything else - food, gas (she commutes about an hour and a half per day, round trip), food and care for two cats and a dog, miscellaneous expenses, etc.


Three. The car


GF drives a car which she financed for roughly $35,000 in 2013.  She has since paid it down to around $27,000.  The problem is, the value of the car in a trade is only $15,000, so a term I learned today is that the car has $12,000 worth of ""negative equity.""  This means that my first idea, dumping that money pit of a car and getting something cheap, will be difficult to do.  Additionally, her credit score is in the mid-600's, which (as we found out today) will prevent her from getting a better interest rate on any newer car.  She still has about five years of payments to make at $490/month.


Four. Credit cards and loans


She has a Discover card with a $10,000 balance, and three other cards with about $1,000 each.  Additionally, she owes her parents something in the ballpark of $8,000.


Five. Ideas I have had and areas where I don't know a damn thing


Some ideas that have come to mind include the obvious stuff like cutting out TV, looking for cheaper car insurance, and generally living more frugally.  I can help her with all of that.  But, what I'm not good at is looking at her lines of credit and figuring out what would be best in terms of helping her re-build her credit and make real progress in reducing her overall debt.  Is there a strategy here?  Should she focus on paying off the smaller debt amounts first and then close those cards before focusing on the bigger ones?  Any advice, especially regarding the credit cards or the car, would be very much appreciated.",finance,1434676929

personalfinance,"[Debt] $65,000 student loan. Able to save minimum $40,000 a year. What should I do? (CAN)","Hello PF,

I graduated from university last year and have landed a sweet job where I have effectively saved $40,000 in my first year. I will continue to save this much + 5,000 to 10,000 incremental increases every few years in savings. It is just sitting in my regular non-saving bank account. 

However, I have a $65,000 student loan account that I want to pay off as soon as possible. I just hate owing people money especially $65,000. However, given my situation, I think it would be wise to pay it off incrementally?

Not sure how other countries work but in Canada you can claim taxes on interest paid on student loans, so I am not really worried about paying interest over time if I just pay the monthly installments, which is currently approximately $711 a month after interest charges.
I can also claim tuition fees, which all in all reduce my overall student loan amount by a few thousand dollars if not more.

Current Interest Rate on my student loans is: 5.35 % Floating.

So what should I do? Should I pay off my student loans ASAP or pay the monthly installments and make other purchases and investments?

If I decide to pay off my student loans, I can repay all of it in exactly 21 months if I dont touch my current bank account balance.

Additionally, I do not have any expenses; no kids, no girlfriend/wife, do not own a home or car, and do not really have any plans to make any major purchases unless I decide to not pay back my student loans.

Any advice would be highly appreciated.",finance,1434677306

I'm a newlywed sitting down with myself and my new wife's finances, and I've used a good bit of research from this board to generate the following thoughts.  I'd appreciate general advice on my approach here.

Our combined household income is about $120,000 pretax currently, and this will increase significantly after I finish my medical residency in 2 years to about $270,000.  This is what we're dealing with at the moment:

Loans:
1) My med school - $150,000 at ~6.5%
2) Her student loan - $12,365 at 6.8%
3) Her credit card debt - $6800 at 12.9%

Aspirations:
1) House down payment about 2-4 years out (target...$40,000?)
2) Honeymoon next year (a few thousand?)
3) Kids in about 5 years?

Currently paying $2,000 in rent (actually quite good for this area).  Have about $15,000 in the bank currently thanks to savings and post-wedding money.

The plan:
1) Aggressively pay off her old credit card debt with the worst interest rate
2) Keep ~$4,000 on hand for emergency fund
3) Save ~$2,500 toward honeymoon
4) Start saving towards the house down payment
5) Increase student loan payments from just above minimum to more aggressive after salary increase

Any thoughts from more experienced folks out there?  That a decent outline to begin with?  I'm in uncharted waters here and appreciate guidance.  Thanks.",finance,1434677435

personalfinance,Should I pay my student loans?,"I understand I made a commitment to BORROW money, and I feel obligated to pay it back. I want to pay it back. But...does it make sense to do so?

In a nutshell: 124K (not including $30K in collection fees) defaulted for the second time (previous attempt at loan rehabilitation). All monies borrowed from federal sources. Dept of Ed holds all of my debt, with a 3rd party doing the collection.

 I am told my only two options are 1. paying the entire loan balance -or- 2. Making monthly payments towards the debt. 

Paying off the debt isn't an option for me. It would suck, but I could afford to start paying between $400-500 per month towards this debt. At about 7%, I won't even cover the interest. And even if I could pay the requested $1500 per month, I would still be in default for the duration of payment. 

So is there any tangible benefit to making arbitrary payments? I won't prevent interest from accruing, I won't touch the principle, and I won't keep myself from a serious default. From the sounds of it, I won't prevent them from tapping into my paycheck either. 

And lastly...I will mention consolidation. I have been told wildly different things by the same people, so any insight would be priceless. I am not sure I will qualify based on conversations I have had with the Dept of ed. At the very least I owe a few thousand dollars to the IRS, and have un-filed taxes from previous years which makes that process impossible. I am working on this currently, but consolidation talks usually stall around this point since they rely on tax returns for info. 

ANY help greatly appreciated. I hope my earning potential will increase someday...but I am in my 30's and realized too late that I could never get married, or own anything more expensive than a stick of gum. I am very close to paying off all other debt and tax monies, but the student loans might not EVER go away...and that seems daunting.",finance,1434677991

**TL;DR got a roth IRA at 18, don't remember the details at all.  Interest rate is sitting at 0.05%.  taken aback when I saw that**

&amp;nbsp;

So 18 yr old me in highschool got the advise to start a ROTH IRA by a teacher.  I did (at a large well known bank),because its tax free and such (apparently a good idea from what I read on here).  However I really didn't know anything about it.  Put some money in from summer jobs, but didnt contribute much during college.

did I sign up for this and just not realize that thats bad at the time because I was dumb, that seems crazy low to me?  is it low because I dont have much money in there? Is that actually normal or am I getting fucked? clearly I don't know what i'm doing, any insight could be appreciated.

personalfinance,Help me decide on pension lump sum buyout offer from ex-employer,"My ex-employer who I left in April 2014 has sent me a one-time lump sum offer in lieu of my pension. Here are the relevant facts:

- I am 32 years old
- Estimated accrued benefit payable as Life Annuity (60 months certain) if I start collecting at 65 years age is $403.50 per month (as of now)

Choices are:
- $11,265 in September 2015
- Monthly payments of $47 for life with 60 payments guaranteed starting now
- Monthly payments of $46.5 for life plus survivor gets $23.25 for life starting now
- Monthly payments of $46 for life plus survivor gets $34.5 for life starting now

Lump sum payment options (if I choose the lump sum):

- Cash to me (20% withheld)
- traditional direct rollover to eligible employer plan
- traditional direct rollover to eligible traditional IRA
- Direct rollover into a Roth IRA

Other things as I understand reading the info booklet:

- If I don't make the election by July 30th, the lump sum option may not be available any more.
If I don't make the election, payments will be deferred until I apply for retirement, after meeting the Plan's requirements for early retirement.
- Relative value of payment options: The lump sum vs. annuity payments equivalency comparisons and calculations are based on IRS interest rates, which are 1.17% for benefit payments in the next 5 years, 3.98% for the 15 years after that, and 5.01% thereafter.
- If I take the lump sum, the docs say it is subject to 10% additional tax since it is an early distribution of pension.
- If I take the lump sum, roll over to Roth, the amount will be taxed but not subject to the 10% penalty
- My spouse and I earn $220000 annually.
- We live in the SF bay area (subject to CA state taxes)
- I am from India and do not plan to stay in the USA for more than another 1-2 years. I do not expect to leave traditional IRA / 401k funds alone until I am 60. I expect to start withdrawing them starting the year after I leave the country.
- I have a 401k from the same ex-employer with Vanguard that I have left alone thus far and have to deal with anyway when I leave the country.

-----------

Without doing any calc, I am leaning towards a direct rollover of lump sum into Roth.

1. Is this the best option?
2. Is rolling over into Roth subject to annual limits?
3. When can I take this money out of Roth? I have heard about 5 years. Is it 5 years after the rollover or 5 years after my first Roth IRA was opened?
4. Does it make sense to roll this into my 401k with the same ex-employer managed by Vanguard? I have $60000 in that 401k all in the 2040 target fund. I am leaning Roth because putting this in the 401k would mean I am again subject to the 10% penalty but it may defer the payout to a period when my marginal tax rate is lower.

personalfinance,I think there is a discrepancy on my credit report but TU closed my investigation with no changes.,"Background info:
About 2.5 years ago (roughly) I owed the government money from an overpayment. I fought it because I was right, only I couldn't prove it. It ended up going to collections where they said the only way to continue my dispute was to pay off the balance first. I paid somewhere around $3900. They sent me a letter in the mail saying it was all taken care of. **I cannot find the letter but I know I have it**. Collections started Feb 13, last payment made Jan 14. 

I have recently been checking my credit reports at regular intervals. I checked TransUnion last week and found that my aforementioned debt was still listed on my credit report with an outstanding balance of **$2395**. It also says ""Pay Status: In collection"". There is a little chart that shows payments, which every block indicates ""Collection"" and ""Unknown"", as in unknown if I have paid. It was updated on 2/16/2014 but still says I have a balance. Experian does not show as much information on this account as TU does. It just shows it as a major issue. 

I checked my FiCO ""report"" and it listed two major issues, one basically said that I have missed payments and have and outstanding balance. This government overpayment is the ONLY account I have ever had in collections. I have literally never missed a payment in 7 years. 

Am I wrong to think that this should be corrected? I feel like if someone looks at my credit report and sees this very misleading block of information that it will hurt me. I don't plan on buying a house within the next 5 years, but I do plan on borrowing more. I have been with my bank (Navy Federal CU) for over 7 years and have borrowed multiple times, never with any issues. If I go into my bank to borrow, will I even have a chance to explain the situation or does it not matter?

I also have a savings plan, although I don't understand how some of the calculators in FAQ work, but that is a small issue, I'm just shooting for the 25x rule. 

What I am wondering about is the rent vs buy a house. It gets talked about all the time on here, and the answer is that ""it depends"" is what usually gets decided. But what I don't understand is no one talks about the income potential after paying it off.

Another thing people talk about is whether it is smarter to pay it off early or instead invest that money, and the consensus seems to be that while interest rates are low, it is better to invest the extra money. 

Now when I look at my parents, who bought a house in seattle in the early 90's, it seems to me they could easily move onto a boat, rent their house for at least 4k a month, (estimate) and sail into the sunset. This is because the house is paid for. On top of that they used it as a home for 20-25 years. 

I don't understand how money in a fund can compete with that. If you were to get income off your investments to pay out 4k a month, you'd have to have 1.2 million saved according to the 25x rule. 

Is this amazing benefit to the house only because they bought in seattle where real estate has been growing lately? Is the benefit much less in other areas? Or is there something else I am missing? Thanks",finance,1434692460

Some background, I'm a 19 year old student that just finished my freshman year in college. I'm currently majoring in Computer Engineering at the best engineering school in my state. Right now I'm interning for a leading company my field. By the end of the summer I'll have made around 5 - 6k and I'm completely lost as to what I should do with it. 


Some facts about my current financial status:

* **A little over 1k in my emergency fund**

* **7.5k in debt from federal school loans**


I've head many different things from a lot of people, including investing in my retirement, paying off my school loans, etc. Right now I'm pretty sure I would like to start an IRA but I'm not sure how much I should invest in that vs spend on paying off my school loans. About half of my student loan dept doesn't accrue interest until I graduate and I don't have to pay any of the 7.5k back until I graduate either. Any advice for what I can/should do at this point would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1434723252

personalfinance,"[Retirement] Employer 401k match is pre-tax, should I contribute as Roth?","Background info:

25 years old. $65k salary. ~$17k in Checking+Savings. ~$36k debt (student loans and motorcycle loan), highest interest rate is 6.55%.

401k info:

If I put in 8%, my company puts in 9%. My contributions can be Traditional or Roth, employer contributions are Traditional. 

Question:

Right now I have it set up so that my contributions are Roth, and the company match is Traditional. I prefer Roth because I expect my retirement income to be in a higher tax bracket than I am in now. My question is, should I contribute as Traditional instead to ""minimize"" the amount contributed to max out my match and put the rest into something like a Vanguard Roth Ira?

Additional question:

Since my highest interest debt is 6.55% and nearly half of my total debt, should I pay that off first before investing in a Roth IRA or increasing my employee 401k contributions?

personalfinance,Just graduated college and I really need help.,"Longtime lurker and I really need help. 

Current situation: 22, recent graduate of Stanford with a decent paying (45k a year) public relations job in downtown San Francisco. Currently, I am living with my parents (not paying rent) and commuting to work everyday. However, I have a potential housing option IN San Fran (close to my office) through a friend that will be available on August 1st. The apartment would cost about $1000 every month which is REALLY good for San Francisco. 

Here's my problem: I have very little money saved up (about $700 to my name) and I have about 3k in CC debt on an Amex card (no interest until November) and about 10k in federal student loans that kick in 6 months from now (December). I did the math, and it looks like I can save up about $4,500 from now until August 1st. I would NOT have to pay a broker's fee or security deposit on the apartment. 

I'm extremely ignorant about the nuances of personal finance and as a result I have no idea what to prioritize financially. Do I prioritize rent/savings or debt? 

Fellow redditors, should I...

A) move in August 1st and pay 2 or 3 months of rent money upfront (about 2k or 3k) which would allow me to save/pay off debts during that time? 

OR

B) Pass on the apartment and run the risk of possibly not finding one for as good of a price in the winter months?

OR 

C) Move in August 1st and only pay 1k of rent in advance and save/pay off debts with the rest? 

OR 

D) alternative plan?

personalfinance,Help Consolidating high interest debts?,"Hi everyone,
I have 8k in credit card debt that I am considering consolidating. It's all high interest debt, with rates ranging from 19 to 22 percent. I was recently advised to go to the credit union here for a personal loan to consolidate, and reduce the interest, but I was denied. It seemed so promising online with the calculator. The interest rates they advertised as an example would have been low enough to make it worthwhile to include my 15k private student loan, save me around 200$ a month in payments, and have everything paid off in five or six years. That could have made things so much easier for me, so I'm still wondering if there are other services out there that could make a similar offer, and approve me for it.
What are the other options, whether debt management or a consolation loan? And how do I find the services that might help in my area?

So, this is my monthly breakdown.
I'm making 1200 at my job, full time.
450 goes to minimum payments on credit cards.
200 goes to my private student loans (9.4 to 9.9 percent interest) my federal student loans are in an income-based deferment and can stay that way for the time being.
250 is going to rent.
The rest is divided between food costs, and trying to save up towards a car, or prepare for moving expenses.

So basically, anything that can help me reduce my expenses now is going to help out a great deal. I want to feel like I'm on my feet again, and find a better paying job that will utilize my degree, which I can't do in my current city. I'd appreciate any suggestions you've got. :-)",finance,1434727151

personalfinance,Wondering what is the best credit card to get?,"I am 24 years old with a pretty solid job, however, I do from time to time need to make large purchases and I have had to do so directly from my checking account (or via debit card, so same thing I guess). I end up draining the majority of my checking account when I do need to make purchases in excess of ~$1,000 and it takes some time to build back up, so it can be a bit painful.

So, as bothered as I am by the idea of being in debt at all, I think I do need to get a credit card. Unfortunately, I have no idea where to start other than looking for the lowest interest rate card.

Does anyone have any good advice on which credit cards/companies are reasonable and not out to squeeze every cent from their cardholders?

Last thing, I am potentially thinking of getting a mileage plus card because I live far away from my parents and it would be nice to be able to go and visit for cheaper, but I am not sure I would really meet the spending threshold to make it worth while.

**Facts:** 

*I work in the public sector. I make $67k. I love my job and plan to stay here as long as possible, but if a better opportunity comes up somewhere in the private sector, I'll take it. &amp;nbsp;

-I can afford to pay up to $1,000 per month on my student loans.

-I graduated with a BS in 2010 and a MPA in 2013. Total combined loans= $53k.

-From 2013 to today, I've paid down $17k toward these loans.

-Today, the total loans amount to $45k, down only $8k from the original total, which means that roughly $9k went toward interest. Fuuuuck.

-My monthly payment is somewhere around $500. But I pay double each month.

-The excess amount ($500) goes towards loans with the combined highest interest rate and principle.
 
-My husband says that, in addition to our mortgage, all the interest I pay each year on my student loans give us a great tax refund, roughly $10,000/year.


**Here are my outstanding loans and corresponding interest rates:**

9. $3,076.94  (6.8%)
10. $13,996.48 (6.8%) *ouch*


**Here are my choices (as I see it):** 

*(a) Apply for Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program starting now and ending after 10 years. Pros: minimum monthly payments, excess forgiven after 10 years. Cons: must consolidate all loans to be a direct loan. Must stay in public or non-profit organization until I'm 37 years old. 

*(b) Status quo.

*(c) Pay minimum payment, invest excess $500 in my supplementary 501(3)B retirement account or gamble stocks on e-trade. 

*(d) Consolidate all loans for a .25% interest reduction. (My understanding is they take the mean of all interest rates then subtract .25% from that) So mine would be 6.3%. 

*(e) Figure out how to pay more principle each month.

*(f) Something else I'm not seeing?

personalfinance,Am I allocating my disposable money in a reasonable way to beef up my emergency fund vs. 401k/Roth IRA/Car loan?,"Hello r/personalfinance - As of 2 months ago, I had an emergency fund for 5 months of expenses, and about 1700-1800 dlls of disposable income per month. I was allocating enough money to almost max out my 401k, and have an HSA account with a couple thousand dollars.


I bought an expensive car (calculated risk - cars are my passion), and I'm currently making 850 dollar monthly payments on it, still owing 52k on it (with an interest rate of 3.25%). The sales tax was a bit higher than I expected, so it cut into my emergency/savings fund by a few grand, nothing to freak out about.


As I adapt to the additional monthly costs, I reduced the contributions on my 401k (still a few % above what my company matches), and have about 900-1000 dlls of disposable income every month. This is not including bonuses I get every 1 to 6 weeks which can vary between 100 bucks and about 3-4 thousand bucks per week (vary largely because of the type of work I do), so I always see that as an extra cushion - I never expect it in my calculations.


That said, I obviously need to beef up my emergency fund, not only because of the additional monthly expense of owning the car, but because I dipped into it a few months ago.
I'm currently in a situation where I want to know if I'm doing the best with my money, regarding how much goes to the emergency fund, vs how much goes to pay extra on the car, vs considering putting a little extra on a roth IRA. From what I've read, I'm almost convinced I shouldnt even consider the Roth IRA until the debt on the car is lower, and I have a decent cushion, but again, I wanted to hear your thoughts.

If I were to allocate all of my disposable income on the emergency fund, it would take me about 8-9 months to feel comfortable (assuming I dont get big bonuses, between now and the end of the year).

Should I stick with allocating about 900-1000 on my emergency fund, and any bonuses go towards paying the car, or just focus on one thing at a time?

Bitcoin,Never create incentives for centralized solutions: A parallel to the history of gold,"I'm baffled how folks who say ""it's okay that people are inconvenienced by congestion/high fees/inability to make small payments, it'll all get sorted out by sidechains/Lightning in the future; meanwhile people can move over to centralized solutions if they want to"" think nothing of what happened to gold and silver. Consider the following: 

In the beginning Satoshi created Bitcoin and the community improved on it. Payment processing was decentralized, security was ensured via PoW, nobody controlled Bitcoin. Life was good, but the economy was small.

_In the beginning people dug gold from the ground and silver was added to alleviate scarcity. You could pay anyone, security was ensured via checking and locking up an actual hunk of gold, nobody controlled where the next gold mined could pop up. Life was good._ 

Then the economy expanded, but blocksize was limited. Congestion raised fees, crashed nodes, and transaction became cumbersome; people who wanted to actually use bitcoin in their lives was frustrated. 

_Then the economy expanded and value rose, but gold and silver remained hunks of metal. They are heavy to carry, are hard to divide into small chunks, and do not travel easily over long distances. People who wanted to actually use gold for lots of commerce was frustrated._

But there is a solution! Coinbase, Changetip and Greenaddress rode to the rescue: We could just do everything offchain as long as you trust us! People flocked to the offchain shops; they are so much more convenient than the decentralized blockchain. It's not a big deal, since they're backed by the chain anyway, no?

_But there is a solution! Governments, banks and big merchant houses rode to the rescue: We could just do everything in our shiny tokens and notes, as long as you trust us! People flocked to the note issuers; they are so much more convenient than the cumbersome, nobody-in-charge metals. It's not a big deal, since they're backed by gold anyway, no?_

The use of offchain shops proliferated. Coinbase gobbled up Changetip, then in turn was bought out by Goldman Sachs. The use of Coinbase became the de facto standard of Bitcoin commerce; some holdouts still do things on-chain, but nobody cares about them, they are so few in number, and it's not like they can sell their coins to anyone but Coinbase at a reasonable price, anyway. Visa contemplates a merger with Coinbase.

_The use of notes proliferated. Banks consolidated and in turn had their note-issuing capacity absorbed by the government. Notes became the de facto standard of commerce; some holdouts still trade in gold, but nobody cares about them, they are so few in number, and it's not like their gold won't end up in a government vault eventually, anyway. Other countries contemplate adhering to a Dollar standard._

Then Coinbase declared, one uneventful morning, they they will no longer buy or sell on-chain coins. Nothing much happened because they pretty much was the definition of Bitcoin anyway, it's of no practical concern to most people.

_Then the federal government declared, one uneventful morning, that they will no longer honor gold exchanges. Nothing much happened because notes are already used in pretty much everything and nobody accepts gold anyway. It's of no practical concern to most people._

Coinbase (now part of the Visa network) betrays the people and starts colluding with bankers, inserting inflation, redistributing coins. A small group of people realized how horrible it is, and how technology can fix it. ""Maybe this time we'll do it right! Let's call it...""

_The Fed (now part of the global cartel of bankers) betrayed the people and starts giving incentives to whoever cared to lobby, inserting inflation, controlling every avenue of payment in the name of taxation.

I'm looking for another part time job for a few days a week.

I decided to approach a florist to see if they would need any help for wedding season. I have only worked for them once so far and I hit the ground running. We prepared, packed up, delivered and set up arrangements for a wedding. I had no idea what I was getting into and realized I was in a bit over my head. I expected to work with plants more directly, and the wedding preparation is hard physical labor. I have severe chronic migraines and I know that I will leave with a migraine every time I work like that for extended periods of time. I spoke to the florist about my strengths and weaknesses and how I felt I could be the best use to them. I felt that I had to make it clear that the majority of my time and energy would still be dedicated to my first job, before they set any expectations that I was worried I would not be able to meet. (Set boundaries now so that I don't set myself up for failure in the future. There is no slack for fuck ups on someone's wedding day.)

Anyway, following the wake of this first day I had my wisdom teeth removed and was out of touch with them for couple weeks (had to heal, and then worked my ass of at job #1 to make up for the days I missed while healing). Today I met with them and gave them my future availability ~ once a week, but I plan on being available to them 2 days a week in the near future... but then they paid me for that shift. 

They paid $10/hr. I was expecting something around $12-13/hr.

My other job pays $11/hr and is much less demanding. 

I'm in a position where I do need the cash, and the extra $80+ definitely helps, but I also feel that I could find another part time job that A) pays better and B) where I would be willing to work more frequently than I feel comfortable committing with the florist (also the florist is kind of bitchy and definitely a little insane).

**TL;DR**  At job #1 I'm low on hours for the next 2 months. Found job #2 but it's intense and felt I was getting in over my head. Set boundaries with new employer. When I got my first paycheck it was much less than what I was expecting or think is fair.  Making $11/hr at Job #1.  Making $10/hr at Job #2 and the job is much more intense/demanding.

personalfinance,Which income based repayment plan do I choose?,"I have a total loan balance of $46,160 with an average interest rate of 4.901. 

I'm starting a new job in July that pays around $52,000/year but have had little income for the first half of 2015. My gross income in 2014 was $5,000. I expect to make about $30,000 total in 2015 and $52,000 in 2016. 

Paying back my loans gives me the option of $0 monthly payment because my income last year was so low. My goal is to pay these down as fast as possible, while having the most flexibility in my payment if something were to come up. 

1) Which IBR plan is most advantageous? I think I'm qualified for all four options. 

2) Can I apply extra money to higher interest loans if I'm at $0 payment for the first year (because it's pulling my tax information from last year)? 

3) Going forward into next year can I apply more money to my loans than IBR requests as a payment? 

Any other advice?

personalfinance,Just got my first legit adult job... advice appreciated.,"I live in Montgomery County MD and will be making 52k ($25/hr). I've crunched the numbers and after taxes, rent, car, fun expenses, loans etc., I'll be taking home roughly $1,100 a month. I'm not sure which is the wisest item to allocate money towards first:


1.) A new car- I drive to work (30 mins vs 1.5 hours by metro), car is an 04 Civic with just about 200,000 miles on it, recently had some repairs (oil leak and spark plug replacement). Work will cover metro, but I loathe the idea of that commute. Moving is not an option- I pay $545 before utilities for a decent group home abt 7 mins walk from everything imaginable. 


2.) LASIK surgery. I have horrid eyesight and contacts cost me $100 every three months.


3.) Loans. I have about $80k in educational loans and about $500 I have to pay off in credit cards. I have a private Ed loan for part of this that is strangling me with a highly monthly ($240). Everything else is federal and very low monthly payments. 


4.) Some sort of medical savings account? My work runs this but I don't have the details yet. I am currently starting meds for very mild bipolar II, will also be getting therapy, health insurance will be covering some 80% of that under I want to say $1,300 dollars? I'm a bit fuzzy on this because I've yet to receive the formal benefits package.

personalfinance,This student loan death trap is insane,"I graduated from ASU 5 years ago w a bachelors in accountancy. Paying out of state tuition i easily racked up $150,000 in debt. Of course classes were too full so I couldn't get in the ones I needed which meant it took 5 years. Trust me, I hardly ever did a semester without taking extra classes.

Anyway, I'm glad we can borrow money for school, but it's way too easy to get a 17-20 year old to agree to sign a loan for 27000 at 11.5% because he has ONE more year to go and can't transfer to another school without literally having 2 years more to finish the degree. So here I am, 5 years later and that one loan is still at 33k, finally down from like 37...

Anyway, I've made 790 on time payments and have zero dings against my credit. I've decided on a career change/enhancement by undertaking a MSc computer science. I've spent the last 18 months sacrificing every ounce of fun to save save save so I can go get this 1 year MSc course done and can start working in technology. 

Anyway, there's one loan at 11.125%_33,000 today. All of the others have manageable interest rates/balances. I've tried to refinance a few times and the banks say no. I think it's because whatever lending company I go through somehow has ties with my lender Discover. So it wouldn't be in their interest to let me lower the rate. 

I've thought about asking friends and family for the money. And paying them back at 5% entirely over 5 years. But they're all scared to take the risk. Even after knowing my employability, drive and 100% clean credit history. And I understand that fear, after all the economy has been tough for the last 5-10 years and so people are naturally trying to be a bit safer.

Does anyone have an idea to help me solve
This loan problem? I'm applying to become a member at a credit union. My dad told me they'll lend you 10k on a signature loan just like that. So I'd put the entire thing against the student loans. Then it'd be 23k, I've got enough to try and pay 500/m on top of whatever the CUs minimum is for 5 year repayment. Any advice on how rates from a CU vs a bank vary. Is it by credit score too? Since it's tied to the employer somehow, I thought it might be because they can see my deposit coming in every month, they have more peace of mind.

personalfinance,"21, and in personal finance turmoil. Advice on how to proceed?","Alright, a little back story first. My mother is a shopaholic. Literally. Throws our stuff out at random.. then brings home more to replace it. Anything that catches her eye. We were with Section 8 housing help, food stamps, medicaid, etc. I was the child she went out to get then ended up having three more- twins and a middle child. 

I wondered where she came up with money, she has not held a job in well over eight years, and when I got a job, all of my money went to her. She talked about me getting a car, but made no move to help me or anything, nor did she even think of me getting a license. Pretty big warning sign, looking back on it. 

(Another warning sign was the fact that I received a call at home about my debt with some random thing, and they listed off my personal information...)

After I graduated high school, she pushed me into college despite me wanting to wait and figure out what I wanted to do. Still no idea how this was all being paid for. 

Now, this is where this all comes in. She kicked me out a few days shy of my birthday in March of last year, and I had to access my student email for the first time and discovered four student loans in my name- three normal loans and an emergency loan. All roughly $1,100 each if I recall correctly. 

I figured this would be easy to dispute and sort out so I brushed it off. I got myself back on track only recently, and wanted to finally get a car. So I go to a dealership, and I'm pretty much set for a car, I told them what I believed was in my name. They said it was fine and I'd probably have a high interest rate and could refinance later. 

Then she pulled up my credit score. 556 with $14,000 of debt in my name. My birth year being noted as 1975 and my address still on file as my mothers address, despite me having paychecks and tax information sent to other more recent addresses. Admittedly, I've added an additional $2,000 or so in hospital bills on top of that but that is currently being sorted out. 

Four notations of possible fraud, so I have that in my favor. Also, I'm sure two of my sisters have at least one thing in their name each- along the lines of utility and internet bills. I have yet to file anything because I want financial stability so I can get custody of them and then take legal action on my mother. 

I've just filed with Equifax to get a copy of my credit score so I can begin gathering information to make a complete case. From there I am really unsure of how to proceed, since this is a delicate matter. 

On top of that, she's taken most of my tax returns from this year since I didn't have a clue on what I did wrong and stupidly let her take over. I have one more tax return to file, it just came in recently, and she is begging for me to pass it over to her and file it. 

(My mother has avoided CPS despite visible signs of abuse, talked her way out of almost everything, so I am hesitant on how to legally proceed anyway...)

**TL;DR** My mother is a crazy manipu... a very strange woman and has taken out a total of $14,000 of debt in my name, and ruined me in terms of getting anything in my name. I began with filing for my credit report and will begin gathering information.

Please, if you have experienced this or something similar, how do I proceed? I've seen one other story similar, but I have to take care of my sisters before I go after legal charges, so I have to worry about the consequences of my actions above all at this point. Any help or advice at this point would be great.

**EDIT** I just went to Credit Karma to make an account and lo and behold, my mother has made an account already. I've submitted a request to have it shut down because of fraud/illicit activity.",finance,1434762377

personalfinance,Tip for Dealing With Navient When Paying Towards Principal,"I apologize if this has been posted before. I am new to reddit. 

I ran into some trouble with Navient months ago when trying to pay more than the monthly balance on my federal student loans. As you likely know, they state on their website that in order to have funds applied to principal on a specific loan, you must send them a check with a letter detailing which loan to apply it to. Naturally, what happens next is they receive the check, disregard your request, and apply the funds evenly across your number of outstanding loans. Then, it is up to you to wade through the mess of dealing with their customer service reps, who often have absolutely no idea what they are doing. 

To sum up my experience, I was basically put into default through some type of mix-up in their system when I paid toward principal. It took over a week and many hours on the phone to rectify the mistake (but not before I started getting calls from Navient's collections department). 

The good news is this can all be avoided. All you need to do is call Navient, tell them to put a specific loan in a separate billing group, and then you can directly pay extra towards principal on whatever loan you have singled out for the separate billing group online. This way, you bypass the entire headache of 'the written check and letter' dance they try to make it seem like you are required to do.

Current Assets: Combined retirement, 115K; Static Savings, 10k; Home Equity, 35K; Personal Investments, 6k; Total: 166k

Current Debt: 105 on the home at a 4.25 interest rate. We pay 1200 a month to the bank for this ATM

Combined Income: 115K

Priorities: Financial Freedom, Early Retirement (possibly), Saving for college, Being debt free. 

As you can see we are rather well positioned for being 29 but we would like some help coming up with the ""best"" strategy. We feel like we are being pulled in so many directions that we feel like we never have ""enough"" money to do everything. Lately we have been seriously discussing putting retirement on hold and just going balls out on paying down the debt, by our calculations that should have us free of it in 1.5 years or we can continue what we are doing now (maxing out husband 401K and a roth IRA for both husband and wife, wife has pension after 65) and pay off that debt in 2.5 years, either way we can not start a 529 until after that debt is paid (we just physically have no more money) Thoughts?

In 2013 I received a call from Sallie Mae offering me a deal to settle my loan effective immediately if I would drop 10% of the total loan as down payment and pay $1700/mo for 2 years. Being naive, I jumped at the chance to get rid of Sallie Mae once and for all. Fast forward to 2015. 

I get a letter from Navient with my 1099-c's included (I expected this in 2014 after they sold the settlement to another party who had the agreement listed). I knew my taxes would be complicated as a result and visited a CPA. The CPA indicated I owed $1500 to my previous state (I just moved to a different state) and $7800 to the feds.

I sadly saw my savings account near depletion but paid off both balances and thought I was done once and for all. Today I received a letter from my previous state stating that while my 2014 taxes were paid in full, I have an estimated tax penalty of almost $130 off a $3600 tax bill. 

While I'm not 100% versed in the shameless art of estimated tax penalties, I was hoping somebody could clarify a few things for me:

1. Did my previous state penalize me because they did not know about my 1099-c's but thought I just underpaid my estimated incomes? Is this a mistake on their part?

2. Does this mean I should expect another estimated tax penalty notice from the feds?

personalfinance,How do you decide on home improvements?,"We're wanting to sell our house in the not so distant future. Ideally, in a few months, but we have to put new siding on. The siding now is literally falling off because it's 30 year old wood that wasn't installed correctly and we've had a lot of rain this year. 

Our windows are 30 year old aluminum, so also need replaced. We've already done the bulk of the interior. So, at this point, we've had two quotes. The higher quality siding is surprisingly cheaper, so we're obviously going with that. But windows are an issue. The quotes seem outrageous. 700 per window, or 1,000 per window. Good windows, but 700 good? Seems insane, especially since we want to sell. 

So, we're looking at a $25,000 outlay. Realtor thinks we will get 80% back on a higher valuation. 

Would it be better to not do the siding or windows and list lower and give an allowance in the sale if it's asked for? But then I feel like the lack of curb appeal will shine through, so maybe the $5K hit is worth it to get it sold.

personalfinance,Is my debt payoff plan feasible and actionable? Please help!,"Hi everyone,


I am a 30 year old woman who graduated last month with a Master’s degree and I began working in my new job less than a month ago. I am finally in a position to secure myself financially and I need your advice about the financial plan that I have created for myself. 


Here’s a breakdown of my debt:


Car Loan: $24,000 @ 5.89 for 71 months. (I know that this is not ideal financing terms, but my old beater finally gave out on me and this is the best deal that I could find for myself with my low credit score of 687, no money down, no cosigner, and in between jobs at the time).


Student Loan: $47,693.95 (one federal, consolidated loan on IBR at 5.75% or 5.5% with auto deductions). The payments are $0/mo from now until August 2016 because of my low 2014 salary. Assuming that my income does not change, my payments will likely increase to about $300/mo in August when I recertify. 


Credit Card: $716 (for a no interest promotional plan card that will be paid off in the next two months).


I take home approximately $3863 each month.


My budget is as follows:


*	Rent – 803
*	Water – 55
*	Electricity – 108
*	Internet/TV – 80
*	Phone – 70
*	Gasoline – 60
*	Car Note – 400
*	Car Ins. – 81
*	Renter’s Ins. – 16
*	Food – 125
*	Entertainment/Misc – 50

Expenses: ~1850


I make enough that I can devote one paycheck to my expenses and the other for my emergency savings fund. I plan on saving 6 months of expenses from now until December before I attack any debt beyond the minimum amount due.


From January 2016 to July 2016 I plan to put $2100/mo ($400/mo minimum due plus $1700/mo extra) towards my car loan. Once I reach July, I am going to go back to $400/month. I figure this way, I would only have two years of payments left on my car. From there, I can devote an extra $1400/mo to paying off my student loan. If I follow this plan, I can pay off my student loans in 3.5 years. Does my financial plan make sense? I would like to use any excess funds to be added to my emergency fund. 


As for my retirement, I am contributing 5% of my salary (the company match) to a Roth 401k. I do not plan to contribute beyond that amount until I am debt free. 


Before I do anything else this year, I want to build up my emergency fund and pay off my credit card. Your feedback is greatly appreciated.",finance,1434815146

I'm a recent/young college grad that has a somewhat well paying job for a student right out of college. I'm currently seeking some financial guidance on my $30k in federal loans as well as financial guidance on a new(er) car. 

My current financial situation:
---&gt;Approximately $2,000 bi-weekly($4000/mo.) +$5k sign-on
---&gt; $400/mo. rent (everything included)
---&gt;$30k federal loans. Mixture of subsidized and unsubsidized. 6 months before payment is required.

I currently drive a crap box that I've had since I got my license. It cost me $2k but has definitely matched that in repairs since I got it 9 months ago, and definitely more if you add insurance($160/mo.). Not to mention my check engine light went on yesterday.......

So my first issue - I'm fed up with my car and I kinda don't want to trust anything used. CPO with warranty sounds good to me. How much can I afford to spend? I planned on putting $8k down and keeping the term at 3 years or less. If I can even afford it of course.....

Second issue - How should I pay off my loans? I honestly have no idea how to go about this..... I was thinking of $400-$500 every pay period, and then using my bonuses/potential raises to help pay it off quicker.

Third - I want to save. You know, just in case money, or for rewarding myself in the future. I used to do bi-weekly transfers back in college that helped, but they were really low. How much should I be saving in respect to how much I should be spending? I don't want to live like I'm making minimum wage, but I'm not too difficult to please, really.

Here's a link to [historical 10 year bond yields] (http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/IRLTLT01USM156N). I did a quick check on Wal-Mart's performance in two time periods to see if it could explain the stock's behaviour.

ROA declined from 9.1% to 8.1% from 2011 to end 2014, yet the stock ran up from $55 all the way to $90. Puzzling.

Our mortgage was up for renewal, and I've rolled in the car loan (for the second vehicle 2004 Civic - van is paid off) and the credit card debt into it, dropping the interest rate to 2.34%, and will be increasing the mortgage payments so that the added principal will be paid off in 5 years.

I feel I'm approaching my situation poorly and would just like a confirmation. I'm 25, have $30k saved up with student loan debt totaling $23k ($10K from Navient, $13k NJClass). I did not finish school and planned on going back so I applied for a Grant. I was denied because my NJ eligibility index exceeded the maximum qualifying index. Now I just want to know is it wise to simply pay off at least the government loan (Navient) in full? I have no real reason to keep all that money saved and waste money on interest in the long run.

politics,Three Reasons Why It's Old People's Fault Millennials Don't #VoteLocal,"Last week the Knight Foundation released a [scathing report](http://users/robertsingleton/Downloads/KnightFoundation_Millennium_Voters.pdf) on the record low participation of millennials in local government. Why don't millennials participate in local elections or care all that much about local issues? They don't know anything about them. And, as a millennial who works four separate jobs that are all related to local politics, I am going to be very blunt about this: it's not their fault. It's the fault of the previous generations. But don't worry old people, my criticisms may be harsh, but I assure you they will be constructive.

Here are the three core reasons, in my eyes, why millennials lack any knowledge or experience with local government and politics, and thus don't feel comfortable enough to participate:

* Lack of Civic Education
* Local Government has a Fundamental Audience Problem
* Justified Cynicism is Misplaced (only because of the first two problems)

**Lack of Civic Education**

This one is actually pretty straight forward: millennials don't know anything about local government because no one ever taught them about it. Think about it, when you were growing up in school you were taught math and english, some history, physical education, maybe some arts if you were lucky, and yes, government. But what did you actually study? The federal government. You learned that George Washington and his band of freedom loving rebels fought off the evil British crown and created the greatest system of government ever known, as governed by the Constitution and Bill of Rights. But what about community governance? Did you learn what a general plan is? Or how about what zoning is? Of course you didn't. Neither did we.

I even studied politics and law in college, but never covered local politics. In fact the only reason why I even understand how a planning commission works is because I also studied environmental studies, and we had to research land use issues and permitting. Yet that governs how every single thing is built and operated in every single community!!!!!! It's an absolutely fundamental concept to understanding the world around us, and it doesn't even get a footnote is most curriculums.

How is it then in any way surprising that most millennials don't feel comfortable voting on these types of issues? If I don't know where my water comes from than what makes you think I would feel comfortable saying yes or no on a hundred million dollar water/sewer bond. What's worse, if I don't understand how public financing for capital improvement projects works, I am probably not inclined to support *anything.*

Here's the good news, the solution to this problem is as straight forward as the problem itself. Mandate that local civics courses be incorporated into K-12 education. Education leaders seem to have no problem changing the common core standards every five years for the past two decades anyway.

**Local Government has a Fundamental Audience Problem**

Now this one transcends age, because local government has a hard time reaching anyone with its archaic and ineffective forms of community information sharing and outreach, but the problem is compounded when dealing with those of a younger generation, mainly due to information sources. I will spare you most of the glaring details as this topic has already been covered at length by many different people, most of whom are much more experienced and articulate than I, but the gist of it is that the way government currently communicates with its citizens is opaque and severely outdated.

Probably the best encapsulation of this failure is explained in a [TED talk by Dave Meslin](http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_meslin_the_antidote_to_apathy?language=en), who contrasts how government usually offers a call to action versus that of a private sector company. The example he uses is to compare a public notice of a new development (see below) to that of an advertisement for buying shoes. One has a clear call to action, is accompanied by a picture of what it is proposing, and clearly communicates to the audience how it can engage further. [This is anything but what I just described.](https://civinomics.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/biz-board-public-hearing-notice-9252014-1-638.jpg)

And don't even get me started on having to navigate through various 1990s style websites to find a sideways photocopied site plan saved as a static PDF... Because I can go all day!!!!

But let's talk about use of media and how that factors into civic participation. To illustrate this concept I will start with an example many of you are probably intimately familiar with. I live in Santa Cruz, which can definitely be considered a college town. Every year when students graduate or move away for the summer you will find our otherwise lovely city streets boasting a plethora of old furniture and mattresses, left by students who frankly have no idea what else to do with them. Every year I hear people complain about this problem, but not once have I ever witnessed the city attempt to reach out to these students in a way that might actually get to them.

For instance, I know that the city gives out special tags every year that I can use to get a free ""bulky item pickup"" from our trash collection service. I know this because I received them in my water bill, alongside a tacky newsletter that resembles a cheap coupon booklet. But let's say I am student, who, chances are, lives in near absolute squalor with many other people. I probably don't pay my own water bill, and am likely to have never seen or heard of this program. Is that my fault?

Now at this point some of you are probably asking about my supposed ""constructive"" criticism, and don't worry, it's coming. But I really want to drive this point home a bit more: *if you want to give us information, use the channels that we actually use to receive it.* 

[Countless studies](http://www.mediainsight.org/PDFs/Millennials/Millennials%20Report%20FINAL.pdf) have already demonstrated that young people don't read the local paper (have any young people besides me ever done this?). So use what we use: Social media, email, advertise at places and events we frequent, etc; really, this isn't that hard. Hell, I can buy a Facebook ad this second, target it by age, gender, location, and interests, and reach 6,000 people for less than $75.00!!!!

[Contrast this with the most recent post made by the City on their Facebook page.](https://civinomics.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-15-at-7-09-06-pm.png)

**Justified Cynicism is Misplaced (only because of the first two problems)**

This last one is a bit more complex, because it involves feelings of trust and some political assumptions, but bear with me. The last major reason that millennials don't participate locally is because we don't distinguish between local government and the federal government. To many of us, it's just the all encompassing ""government"". This stems from our lack of civic education and the audience problem. And, in case you haven't noticed, government as a concept is not winning many popularity contests right now. In fact most most people would rather [eat dinner with a family of cockroaches than a member of Congress.](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/01/congress-less-popular-than-cockroaches-traffic-jams.html)

Yes millennials did show up to vote in record numbers in 2008 to elect Obama because, frankly, he inspired us to believe that government could change from what it was perceived as. Seven years later, and regardless of who you blame, not much has happened to change that original perception. And consider this, in our lifetime the cost of higher education has quadrupled, the cost of living has risen substantially while real earnings have either stagnated or declined, no government action has been taken to address climate change (despite an overwhelming majority of millennials believing this to be a core issue), and we have slogged through a financial crisis that has left most of us either chronically under employed or not employed at all.

To put this in context, I was at a political campaigning event yesterday that featured Joe Smitian, a local Supervisor from Palo Alto, as a panelist. Joe, bless his heart, said something I will never forget. ""If people are going to trust you as a candidate, and government as a whole, you absolutely need to be able to answer one fundamental question: How has their government improved their life?""

He continued, ""if you cannot answer that question then you have no business running for office."" Now I am paraphrasing a bit, but the core message here is pretty obvious: most millennials can't answer this question. It is because of our lack of civic education, and the government's inability to communicate, that our justified mistrust of what the federal government has (and hasn't) done, that makes it so difficult for so many of us to care.

personalfinance,"I have a car payment and two credit cards, I'm about to get an enlistment bonus, where should my money go?","TL;DR: Owe money on car (20k) 2 credit cards ($4,700 and $3,900). I'm getting $20,000, thinking about payiing off car first, then paying credit cards, then shredding credit cards. 

This almost seems like an easy question, I should pay off whatever has the highest interest rate first right? I'm getting a re enlistment bonus for about $40,000 (after taxes) and I'm only getting half up front which would be around $20,000. 

Here's what I owe. 

Car payment: Monthly payments of $360, interest rate: 4% I owe roughly $19,800

Amazon Credit Card, Interest is high 15%, I owe $4,7000

Discover Card, I have 0 interest on this for about six more months, I owe $3,900

Now I know it would make sense to pay off my credit cards first since they have the higher interest but here's the problem. When I had bought my vehicle initially, I had no credit card debt. All I had was my car payment. I dont know how it got out of control, I just started racking up credit card debt. 


Anyway, so my plan was to pay off the car completely, that might even allow me to get liability insurance and thus paying less for insurance. Also, I was thinking about transfering all my amazon credit card debt to another credit card which would give me 1% interest for a year. with paying the car off, that would free up $360 a month which would normally go to my car payment but instead, it could go to my discover card, I figure once I pay that off, I'd pay off the Amazon card. Also, I think I'm going to either cancel my credit cards or maybe just stash one away in case of emergencies sine I can't seem to control myself sometimes, how does that sound? 

I should also had that, I'll get the remaining $20,000 over the next 6 years which is about $3,000 a year. I know a few of you might say to put some of this money in savings but, I've re-enlisted in the military for 6 years so, I'm guaranteed job security for the next 6 years at least, unless I goof up or something.",finance,1434840027

personalfinance,Confused by my new paycheck and need some guidance.,"So I recently started a new job and increased my salary from 46K to 54K. After using various compensation calculators, I fully expected to have a significant increase to my new paycheck--a couple hundred at least. But after receiving my first full paycheck, the difference is only $40. Could this be accurate?

In my old job, I was paid semi-monthly and filed for 2 deductions in my W4.

Currently, I get paid bi-weekly and filed for 0 deductions because I found myself always owing taxes in April. I'm also pretty sure I pay less in healthcare or similar than my last company.

I know this is difficult without looking for specific breakdowns in my paychecks, but I'm shocked and disappointed that a 8k increase in salary could result in a $40 increase per paycheck. I suspect that it's my federal tax withholdings but am hesitant to refile my W4 if my deductions should be 0. I'm single without any dependents.

I'd rather not pay the fee.  My new insurance plan sadly does not qualify for an HSA, so I need to figure out what to do with this one now.

2. Roll $5k into the same and cash out $1k in receipts and add to my taxable investments.

Furthermore, please do not utilize this post as a platform for you to give your manifesto on the broken system or what have you- I *seriously* need a conversation.  I also will be doing the best I can to protect my identity and will try to be reasonably vague; you can ask for extended help.

Sparing you every minute detail on my financial history, I am in my mid-20's and have never been in a point in my life where I was not working 2 or more jobs.  I did invest in savings to an extent, but often live paycheck-to-paycheck.  I took a risk and moved abroad to work, where the cost of living has been quite cheap and I have finally been able to manage savings.

Currently, I have maybe 6 friends at max and a girlfriend who is equally frugal.  I budget monthly using excel spreadsheets and calculate every last cent.  My biggest hurdle is 92k dollars distributed among 7 or 8 student loans; some of which are around 4,000-6,000 with a 4% interest rate, whereas others are astronomically high with a low interest rate that I can never feasibly pay off anytime soon.  

I have recently been accepted to graduate school, and am quite excited, as I will be doing it abroad where I have already paid tuition out of pocket.  This will leave me with the heavy cost of living (rent, in particular, will be a bit high) and 3 AES loans that they refuse to put on hold while I study, reaching about $150/month (as opposed to my current $550).

Now, I am at a point where I have saved roughly $4k, and maybe 3-4k in foreign currency that I will slowly be converting.  I have a job that is location independent that gains me about 1500 a month, but continuing to live a meager lifestyle is becoming very taxing.  

Now, after paying for the last plane ticket, I am left with a few options. The first is that I need a new computer soon.  I have not had a new computer since 2007 and, although my baby does well, it is bordering ridiculous with the level of maintenance I need to keep it afloat (and because I am making my money via internet- a working computer is a sine qua non).  The second is that there is going to be a flood of heavy, immediate expenses, which I can probably take the hit from.

With that, let's assume that I have a steady 3-4k left in the bank.  Should I dump these funds into paying off a good chunk of the loan or just suffer through it?  The three loans I have to make immediate payments on are 10k, 11k, and 5.6k, whereas the other (PRIVATE) loans will still be gaining interest while I am in school, virtually erasing my efforts so far.  

With that, I cannot really *imagine* the point in saving now --&gt; to what extent would cutting out any source of entertainment from my life, working indefinitely for shit wages and pushing myself to the very limits really mean if a year's worth of savings MAY pay off 1 loan, rendering me with a sturdy 86k to still deal with?  I do not see how tightening the belt any further really warrants any level of merit.

I considered crowd funding, but I do not know if that will actually work or is even viable.  The reality is that I have been fighting so long, and have earned everything on my own and managed to do well financially at this point- however, my current state of living will render me ""stuck"" in life and unable to achieve my long term goals.  I need this schooling to achieve my dreams and I **CAN** do it.  What I need help on is brainstorming and reaching out to other means to doing it where it will be more pleasant and rewarding.

Thus, what I need perspective on is how to allocate my funds properly or suggestions for location independent work that may help me to lessen the burden of my expenses.  I am no longer at a point of financial misery and can manage myself; what I need is help fine-honing my attack plan to be able to achieve it adequately.  

Once more, I hope that this is informative enough for you and just would like to explore more options.  My personal safety is, naturally, key and I hope that the community here can strive towards providing me with positive reinforcement and good suggestions.  I apologize for any moment where I was vague or contradictory and hope that I articulated my situation well enough.  I just want to way out risks vs rewards in spending habits to find out the best way to resource my time and money.",finance,1434867858

MachineLearning,Debugging Neural Network for (Natural Language) Tagging,"I've been coding a Neural Network for recognizing and tagging parts of speech in English (written in Java). The code itself has no 'errors' or apparent flaws. Nevertheless, it is not learning -- the more I train it does not change its ability to predict the testing data. The following is information about what I've done, please ask me to update this post if I left something important out.

I wrote the neural network and tested it on several different problems to make sure that the network itself worked. I trained it to learn how to double numbers, XOR, cube numbers, and learn the sin function to a decent accuracy. So, I'm fairly confident that the actual algorithm is working.

The network using using the sigmoid activation function. The learning rate is .3, Momentum is .6. The weights are initialized to rng.nextFloat() -.5) * 4

I then got the Brown Corpus data-set and simplified the tagset to 'universal' with NLTK. I used NLTK for generating and saving all the corpus and dictionary data. I cut the last 15,000 sentences out of the corpus for testing purposes. I used the rest of the corpus (about 40,000 sentences of tagged words) for training.

The neural network layout is as follows: There is an input neuron for each Tag. Output Layer: There is one output neuron for each tag. The network is taking inputs for 3 words: first: the word coming before the word we want to tag, second: the word that needs to be tagged, third: the word that follows the second word. So, total number of inputs are 3x(total number of possible tags). The input values are numbers between 0 and 1. Each of the 3 words being fed into the input layer is searched for in a dictionary (made up by the 40,000 corpus, the same corpus that is used for training). The dictionary holds the number of times that each word has been tagged in the corpus as what part of speech.

    For instance, the word 'cover' is tagged as a noun 1 time and a verb 3 times.

Percentages of being tagged are computed for each part of speech that the word is associated as, and this is what is fed into the network for that particular word. So, the input neuron designated as NOUN would receive .33 and VERB would receive .66. The other input neurons that hold tags for that word receive an input of 0.0. This is done for each of the 3 words to be inputted. If a word is the first word of a sentence, the first group of tags are all 0. If a word is the last word of a sentence, the final group of input neurons that hold the tag probabilities for the following word are left as 0s. I've been using 10 hidden nodes (I've read a number of papers and this seems to be a good place to start testing with)

None of the 15,000 testing sentences were used to make the 'dictionary.' So, when testing the network with this partial corpus there will be some words the network has never seen. Words that are not recognized have their suffix stripped, and their suffix is searched for in another 'dictionary.' Whatever is most probable for that word is then used as inputs for it.

This is my set-up, and I started trying to train the network. I've been training the network with all 40,000 sentences. 1 epoch = 1 forward and backpropagation of every word in each sentence of the 40,000 training-set. So, just doing 1 epoch takes quite a few seconds. Just by knowing the word probabilities the network did pretty well, but the more I train it, nothing happens. The numbers that follow the epochs are the number of correctly tagged words divided by the total number of words.

First run 50 epochs: 0.928218786

100 epochs: 0.933130661

500 epochs: 0.928614499 took around 30 minutes to train this

Tried 10 epochs: 0.928953683

Using only 1 epoch had results that pretty much varied between .92 and .93

So, it doesn't appear to be working...

I then took 55 sentences from the corpus and used the same dictionary that had probabilities for all 40,000 words. For this one, I trained it in the same way I trained my XOR -- I only used those 55 sentences and I only tested the trained network weights on those 55 sentences. The network was able to learn those 55 sentences quite easily. With 120 epochs (taking a couple seconds) the network went from tagging 3768 incorrectly and 56 correctly (on the first few epochs) to tagging 3772 correctly and 52 incorrectly on the 120th epoch.

personalfinance,I was approved for a credit card and learned something.,"I know this won't be fascinating but I've read *many* questions here regarding how to improve one's FICO, such as ""Should I carry a balance on a credit card?""

Maybe this will help answer some questions.

I applied for a credit card over the web which took 5-10 minutes.
I receive a call a few hours later saying that I was approved.  
Because I was on the road, I didn't bother asking what the credit limit or interest rate was.

When I out of the vehicle I called back.  I was quite surprised that the limit was so low and the interest rate so high.

Turned out that since I had frozen my credit report and they didn't have access to my FICO so they gave me the default amounts.

I unlocked my credit report and they checked my FICO.  It's over 800. 
Now the credit limit jumped to the number I requested and the interest rate plummeted. 

The only factor in determining my limit and interest rate was the FICO.  I think most people already know this.

I pre-pay my other credit cards.  If my current balance is, let's say, $400, then I'll pay $500 several days prior to receiving the bill (the excess $100 is in case I use the credit card from the time I sent the payment to the closing date). 

When I receive the bill, I don't need to make a payment.  I do this in the event that if something goes wrong and the payment isn't sent out or received when the bill arrives, I'll have sufficient time to correct the problem.  Yes, this happened to me.

I hope this settles the issue of should ""Should I pay off my credit card each month or carry a balance to improve my FICO""?

Legal-$225/month
 No other fees or interest. Payments started in Feb 2015 and I currently owe 1350. Must be paid off by December.

Medical-$250/month. 
I owe $2100 for an ER visit (after insurance paid their part). They agreed to set up a payment plan at $250/month (again no fees/etc). FWIW the original bill was right around $3500 and they agreed to reduce it if I set up monthly payments and pay them on time.

Student loans: $325/month
$7700 last-minute private loan with 9.6% interest (fixed) and a $50 min. Term is 10 years, but due to the interest rate I plan on getting it paid in a little over 2 years. Payments are due while I'm in school (had to do this because it was the lowest interest rate I could get). No deferment or any of the benefits from federal loans.

So I have 2 fixed payments which are essentially a 0% loan and one that I can vary. Legal bills I have to either do the agreed upon plan or pay it in full. For the hospital--could I get them to lower monthly payments by ~100 and extend the plan accordingly? I'm able to pay a good faith payment upfront (~300ish) to show them I intend on paying.

$15,577.00| 7.21%| NON SUB

My Car loan is was around $15,000 with a 72 month loan at 4.5% interest. I think I have around $5k left to pay on it.

We know we want to pay off our credit card debt. We have about $11k across a 3 different credit cards. 

My question is, what makes the most sense. 

If I pay off our credit cards that leaves us with $119,000.

Then if I pay off my car that leaves me with $114,000.

We own our house that we purchased for $155,000 with an interest rate o 4.625 in January of 2014. We have roughly have $136,732.64 left on the house. 

Lets say I pay off my first year of Dental School debt. (I will be starting my second year in August and have been awarded another 55,638.00 in loans but I do not have to take them all) That would leave us with $52,561.65.

My wife and I want to put aside enough money to cover our monthly bills (which we will put into a higher interest earning account and not touch) for 6 months which is around $12,000. Leaving $40,561.65.

We also want to have $5000 in our regular savings account leaving us at $35,561.65.

At this point the car is gone and the credit cards are gone. This would give us roughly $900 more per month. $250 = car, rest is credit cards.

I also want to get LASIK surgery so we are now at $30,561.65.

We have a leaky basement/foundation problem so that could take up to $10,000 plus new carpeting leaving us at $18,561.65

We want to get a new mattress leaving us with $15,561.65.

We also want to have the exterior of our house painted which could be around $2000 leaving $13,561.65.

We also owe our mother in law $5000 leaving us with $8,561.65.


Herein lies my question. The extra 900 a month would still not be enough money to cover all of our expenses. I would HAVE to take more than the minimum (cost of tuition) out each year. BUT I would have eliminated 1/4 of my debt from dental school.

For arguments sake what if I did NOT pay off my current school debt and instead we kept that money aside in a high interest earning account and pulled money from it each semester as if I was taking out the full disbursement. Basically every semester taking out around $9000 to use for living expenses.

I would love any and all advice. If I made any miscalculations or am being an idiot about something please point it out.

personalfinance,College debt and how to tackle it,"Hello everybody, I recently stumbled upon reddit and more specifically this subreddit. It seems that this would be a good place to learn how to go about tackling my current, and future student debt.

Background information:

I am currently 18 and want to be proactive about my student loans so they don't build up and flood me in the next 4 years and beyond. Currently I have finished my first year of college and have a debt of about $10k. 

I have two direct unsub loans for $4k and $2k with an interest rate of  4.660. I did not know this until checking, but these actually begin gaining interest right now instead of after college like the direct sub loans

I also have 1 direct sub loan for $3.5k with an interest rate of  4.660  as well. However, this doesn't start gaining interest until I am finished with college. 

Going forward in my next 3 years of college I plan to have to take out similar amounts each year. So I can see that it will go up exponentially with the interests that the unsub loans are going to be getting.

I currently am working 40 hours a week at $8.50/hr while I am out of college, then when college starts up again my hours will go back to around 20 a week. So as of right now I am making nigh $1k a month after taxes.

Here is where it would be ideal to live with my parents so I don't have to pay expenses such as food, rent, and others. Unfortunately, my parents and I are not exactly on good terms. They happen to be hardcore religious and I just happen to be homosexual. The only reason I mention this is because some may say to try and patch things up with them, but I have numerous times and I was actually living with my grandpa since I was 16 until he had to move away for medical reasons. So he no longer has a house that I can stay at so I looked for affordable living.

 I pay $450 a month on rent and about $100-150 on food, along with $50-75 on gas. Total spending a month: ~$675. So I am sitting around $325 a month of expendable income. In theory it would clearly be good to spend this on my loans, but I also want to be able to have fun with my friends and boyfriend as well. I don't want my life to just be work, school, and sleep. I find being happy is a big importance in life and I'm getting a little scared that these loans may keep me from being able to live happily in the future. So that being said I probably have around $200 a month income that I can save and put towards my loans(after factoring out costs of doing activities, phone bills, etc.). However, when college starts back up that 1k will turn closer to about $600. Which is clearly lower than my ~$675 I spend monthly on necessities. The only reason I was able to make it through this year of college is because I saved last summer (that $200) and took out an extra $1k on my loans (Which I'm not sure if this is going to be hurt me big time later). 

Basically I have $200 extra income a month, but that will be helping me get through the school year for my living needs. Ideally I would like to save this and put it in my loans, but I simply don't see that being a possibility unless you guys here teach/tell me otherwise. 

So with my little income being used elsewhere until I can better optimize it, which hopefully I'll learn how here, I am at a loss of where to go next.

Overall quick rundown:

I am attending college and finished one year so far. I now have $10k in debt from loans this year alone.
I have to attend three more years and I will be taking out around $9.5k/year. The interest rate on these loans is  4.660. However, only $6k of this amount is gaining interest while I am in college. 
[Unfortunately I do not know of any programs I can plug this data into to get a rough estimation as to what my total out-of-college debt will be at it's total]
I theoretically have $200/month to spend on loans now, but I believe I'll be needing that $200/month to get me through the school year.

My question for you guys is how should I go about dealing with this debt I am getting? What can I do as of right now to help myself in the future. Is there anything I can do or will I just have to deal with a massive debt build up once I am out of college? What tips and tricks do you have for me in other to help me get through this. I am starting to get worried about this and considering dropping out of college, but at this point I feel that this debt is, for lack of a better term, forcing me to continue because if I don't continue it will only be worse for me in the future. 

Please let me know if you need more details on my situation as I will gladly reply to it in order for you to help me better.",finance,1434935848
personalfinance,Some Scenarios of what happens if you contribute to IRA or 401k. Get a 25% return on investing in your own retirement!!!!!,"Ok, so maybe I don't need to convince anyone here to save for retirement but maybe I'll convince someone who is seeing something like this for the first time. Here goes.

                     
Few Assumptions:

-You earn $70k/Year

-You are filing single

-You take standard deduction 

-We are looking at federal only since states vary

-Ignore the 2014 Tax Return Column

-There is no employer match on that 401k

Take a look at this:
http://imgur.com/OiwlFue

Few scenarios;

Plan 1 - We take our check and do our thing. No saving for retirement.

Plan 2 - We contribute the max to our Traditional IRA ($5,500)

Plan 3 - We contribute the max to our 401k ($18,000)

Now, we can see by putting away $5,500 in our IRA, we save $1,375 in taxes. Boom! 25% return! If we put $18,000 in our 401k, we save $4,500!! Bang! 25% return again!!! This is because at $70k/Year, you are in the 25% tax bracket. You can see your ""rate of return"" by which tax bracket you are in here: http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/tax-brackets.aspx 

By contributing to your retirement not only are you setting yourself up for success in the future you're saving a ton of money! If you contribute the max to your IRA, you're bumping your effective tax rate down from 15% to 13%. If you contribute the max to your 401k, you're bumping it down from 15% to 9%!!

My guess, off the cuff, is that XOM would of been a home-run stock to own. 

EDIT: Just running some numbers, it looks like Home Depot would of been a major home-run. It grew approx. 600X since June 1985. Imagine buying a few thousand dollars back then and letting ride. Makes one wonder if buying a house is a certainty to long-term wealth. 

EDIT #2: Also, what were interest rates like in 1985? I think they easily 10% or so for most plain vanilla loans like a mortgage and corporate bonds.",finance,1434940535
personalfinance,College advise for someone with little PF skills,"Hey /r/personalfinance

I am in need of some help. I read the Wiki/FAQ on student loans and retirement, but they didn't answer the questions I have. So here it goes:

As of this moment, by the end of the summer I plan to have about $9000. My mother and I just did our calculations for how much we need to borrow for students loans, which came out to be about $18,300 (that's what we'll need in private loans, federal loans were already factored in).

My questions are:

* What should I do with my money? 
    * Should I put all of it towards my tuition and take out a smaller loan? 
    * Should I put some of it in a Roth IRA, have some for an E-fund, and then the rest for tuition?
* Following those, are there some well-known private loans I should avoid? I read somewhere that Sally Mae screwed someone over, but that was probably them being uneducated. Question still stands though.

My mother suggested we take $6000 and put that for tuition. Then take $1000 for an emergency fund, and the rest or less in a Roth IRA. Maybe less and keep some for spending. Is this a sound plan? Should I do something else?

As always, your help is really appreciated.",finance,1434940545

personalfinance,Consolidate CC Debt or Pay Off Via HE Loan?,"TL;TR I have high debt to income ratio right now on 0% intoductory credit cards and did the whole balance transfer thing. When rates adjust, what is the best way to pay off this CC debt?




The two options I can think of are a debt consolidation service like (prosper, lending tree) or a home equity loan. Or... I could keep everything as is and not add another credit line and just pay down debt and end up having to pay some interest expense... would this be the best thing for my credit score?

I bought a house for 400,000 a year ago. I put 50% down and currently owe $185K @ 3.25%, the mortgage is a 7 year ARM that can adjust up to 8%.  The house is currently estimated on Zillow for 500K. I had to do some major (unexpected) renovations the inspector missed, but I wanted to do them eventually and it will add another 50-75K in value.  The renovation work is how I got into CC debt.

I used balance transfers and 0% interest rates to fund all other expenses and used my cash flow to pay the contractor and the mortgage.

I have about $12k in total debt: Interest on $6k will start March, 2016 and the other half June, 2016. Right now my credit scores are good with no missed payments. I am zinged for age of credit score and credit utilization.

Savings is $0 (all went into the house and renovation work... I had a cushion / rainy fay fund and then it rained haha). My gross income is $41K with net after taxes and insurance only $2400 / month.  My mortgage payment is $1,400 including escrow for taxes. So there is little left over at the end of each month... usually $300 (maybe $500 if I really cut back).  If I do a 7 year consolidation loan I would have the time to chip away at the debt and easily make the monthly payments.  I was also thinking I could take a loan out on the house which could work as well (assuming I could get one).  Is one better than the other? Both are adding another credit line while keeping net debt the same... so are they essentialy the same? Any other options I should consider? (My current job is ""on-call"" so it rules out the option of having a side job).

personalfinance,"Help for graduate study in foreign country, from USA, possible? (X-post from /r/studentloans)","Due to a series of unfortunate events, some of which are health related, I've decided to get a fresh start for a graduate program. I've received an acceptance but there is no longer aid available to the foreign nationals (outside the EU/EEA) who aren't already resident in the country for the first year (while funding for the 2nd year is essentially guaranteed). I've decided to take this opportunity and invest the $20K despite my general hatred of loans because it is an excellent school and in the grand scheme of things something I could pay off fairly easily in my field (engineering) or if I decide to turn to consulting/finance, etc to make a larger salary before returning to the field.
About me: 

* Finished top 3 US engineering Bachelor's degree a couple years ago with good grades.

* Currently debt free

* Finishing up first year of a different graduate program which will unfortunately be discontinued for the next year (done via scholarship)

* Been using a credit card for a few months that is paid off in full at the end of each month

* Family is dirt ass poor so no assets/property to speak of

* No one in family (as far as I'm aware) has good credit or income over $40k/y

* If I pass up this opportunity, I will mostly likely spend 2 more years to work up a good application for grad school again (3 year old recs and current program is quite factory like with professors having very little contact with students)

I  tried one of my banks an they were willing to give me the loan provided I can provide a co-signer in good standing with a good salary which eliminates my entire family as I was told I don't have enough of a credit history on my own to get approval. Is there anyway to get around this? I don't think they are willing to increase the interest rate to get rid of the co-signer req and I'm trying to stray away from the super predatory agencies.

personalfinance,Seeking further wisdom to improve investment and stability,"Hello,
I have perused the wiki and believe that my finances are in OK shape - but I'm hoping for wisdom and advice on how to make them better!
My finances, in the order specified by the wiki:

Step 0: ""Budget and reduce expenses, set realistic goals.""
Income = $4000/mo [$73k salary]
Expenses (per mo.)
• Rent = $920
• Credit cards = $1250 (no debt)
• Other = $50
• Emergency Savings = $1000 [$7.7k out of $15k goal]
• Company 401k = Invested automatically before paycheck [$13k vested, $28k overall]
• Car Payments (5.3% int) = $900 [$4.4k remaining]
• IRA = on hold. [$15k balance]
• Higher Education Savings = on hold.
• Life/Travel Savings = on hold.

Step 1: ""Build an Emergency Fund""
Current balance of $7.7k, I want to get it to $15k for 6months living expenses safety. Saving with Barclays Online Savings (1.00% int.). Will likely move $5k into a CD when I hit $15k.

Step 2: ""Employer-sponsored matching funds""
Employer matches 80% of my 5% pre-tax 401k contribution. Vested at $13k, $28k total.

Step 3: ""Pay down high interest rate debts""
$4400 car loan at 5.3% interest. I am required to pay $193/mo. I pay $900/mo.

Step 4a: ""Saving for retirement in IRA""
I was saving $400/mo but stopped recently to up my contribution to Emergency Fund and pay down my car loan.

Step 4b: ""Higher education expenses""
I am considering going back to school at some point to get a higher degree (masters most likely) in psychology or similar. This may lead to a more fulfilling career as it is in line with my passions. Short term financial returns may be lower with this strategy. I want to be able to understand the financial implications first.

Step 5: ""Save more for retirement""
N/A

Step 6: ""Save for other goals""
In 3-5 years I suspect that I will be interested in taking some time off from working ""full time"" and travel. I hope to be able to save up for this life event so that I do not need to dip too deeply into my emergency fund to do so.

Economics,Why investment expenditure is insensitive to monetary policy,,finance,1434982745
personalfinance,"DCF - What it is, why it matters, why you should think about it, for investing","Many people nowadays are recommending stocks, funds, what have you, for investing. Many many questions come on here like ""Hey I have X amount of money what should I do with it"" and the responses are invariably ""put it in a low cost fund close your eyes and wake up rich!"" or ""you will never beat Mr. Market so just go index"" or ""depends on your risk tolerance, but stocks are a safe bet"" or ""you are young and have time, young kimosabe, go market and wait 20 years"". 

So here's my counterpoint to all the responses - stocks are at an all time high, and people are still recommending stocks. But... have you ever wondered why? Ever thought a little bit more than the perfunctory answers? 

Discounted Cash Flow valuation - DCF for short, is the classical method developed by Benjamin Graham (Warren Buffet's mentor) to value a stock based on all its future cash received, discounted to the present. ""Security Analysis"" is the book, the Bible of value investing. This means... Company X, worth one million dollars in the market now, will receive 100,000 per year for the rest of eternity. So what is purchasing that 100,000 worth of cash flows worth NOW? What is a fair price to pay? You then compare the DCF result to the current market price to come up with whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued compared to its current price. Due to the time value of money, you add up all the money you get in the future, and discount that value to what it would cost today. 

The key here, nowadays, is the interest rate. Interest rates have been ~0% for half a decade plus. How does this affect a stock's price? 

PV = CF1 / (1+k) + CF2 / (1+k)2 + … [TCF / (k - g)] / (1+k)n-1

So... blah blah blah, maths. Here is the key point from the link: 

""DCF analysis shows that changes in long-term growth rates have the greatest impact on share valuation. Interest rate changes also make a big difference. Consider the numbers generated by a DCF model offered by Bloomberg Financial Markets. Sun Microsystems, which in 2012 traded on the market at $3.25, is valued at almost $5.50, which makes its price of $3.25 a steal. The model assumes a long-term growth rate of 13%. If we cut the growth rate assumption by 25%, Sun's share valuation falls to $3.20. If we raise the growth rate variable by 25%, the shares go up to $7.50. Similarly, raising interest rates by one percentage point pushes the share value to $3.55; a 1% fall in interest rates boosts the value to about $7.70."" 

There you have it. So Amazon, growth rate is nuts, so high value. Doesn't actually make money, but that's a side-point. Aside from the intrinsic stock's growth rate, interest rates are the biggest factor in how a company's future CASH is valued at the present. 1% in the example above, makes a company appear worth WAY more than it would if current rates were 5% instead of 2%. 

This is the factual reason that the stock market is ""overvalued"" - the interest rates literally have nowhere to go but up. 1% up on interest rates will destroy any company's present value, and therefore, their stock price, which is why many call the current market ""priced to perfection"". 

So just think about this before jumping into the low-fee 401k fund bandwagon. You have to think critically about how these values are concocted on Wall St, and then think about what will happen if the Fed raises interest rates - even in the slightest. 

So bonds will go down, yes. But... not as much as stocks. Not by a longshot. Conservative people who want to hold on to their money would not be all-in investing in the stock market at present. 

I recommend bonds, which will be destroyed less than stocks. I would recommend a money market fund, except if you read the fine print on your 401k's plans, MMF can be looted as soon as they have any hiccups. It isn't ""parked cash"" for you so much as a ""nice juicy piggy bank to be raided whenever there's an issue"" for your 401k. So yes, aside from your personal account, if you have a 401k plan and want to reap the benefits of your company match, you have to allocate to SOMETHING. MMF out, stocks out, find the most conservative bond fund you can. 

That's it. Wait for blood in the streets to reallocate to stocks.",finance,1434984352

I'm currently in a graduate program related to nonprofit work, which I will be finishing up this fall 2015 semester. I will be finishing higher education with student loans clocking in at a total of $53,734.00.

Since I am getting a degree in nonprofit management, the natural plan is to work in the nonprofit sector going forward. I have read a little about the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program that the government offers, but other than what I have read online I have no knowledge of this program, and the page of the federal website is a bit confusing.

Does anyone have experience with the PSLF program? Has anyone used it, or do you know the details of how it works? My loans are split up among several borrowers. I have direct loans, Perkins loans, institutional loans, and alternative loans from Citizen's Bank. The PSLF program only appears to apply for direct loans, which comprise $38,084 of all of my loans.

I suppose my specific question is how using this program will look in terms of paying back my loans. I have to be working full-time at a nonprofit during the 10 year period. Can I switch employment from one nonprofit to the next? What if I did 4 years of nonprofit work 1 year of for-profit work, and then went back to nonprofit work for the next 6 years? Can I essentially put a halt on the PSLF program (still making payments during my for-profit work of course), and then finish the PSLF program in 11 years? Will I have to submit a new PSLF form whenever I change jobs?

What is a qualifying repayment plan? It says that is the plan I would need. I was under the impression that I would pay the minimum payment possible for the direct loans (since they are the ones I want to forgive) and then make bulk payments when possible on my other loans to pay them off as much as possible. My original plan was to live at home for a few years and pay off my loans in huge chunks, but if I'm using this PSLF program, I should only do that for the non-PSLF programs correct? The way the website worded qualifying repayment plans made it seem like I'd be paying much more than the minimum.

tl;dr: is this a worthwhile program to look into, or will I not end up saving much money in the long run? Basically I don't want to get screwed into paying small payments for 10 years only for it not to work out if I could have been making larger lump sum payments over those 10 years.",finance,1434987905
personalfinance,Personal Finance/Retirement/Real Estate Question: Would love to get some outside feedback/insight. Details inside.,"Hi All,

So my wife and I have been given what we feel like is a sound investment opportunity, but was hoping I could share some details of our situation and see if anyone out there has any additional perspective or insight.

My father-in-law has offered to buy a home with us in Palm Springs, CA.  It is a 700-thousand dollar home and we would each pay half of that in cash.  He would then live in the home, until he passes.  He's in his mid-60's, so that could be anywhere from 20 to 30 years from now.  At which point, the home would be ours.  (when we purchase the home, we will be purchasing it under our names, it would just be him living there.)

We are in a position where we have the cash available to do that ... I guess my question really is, SHOULD we do that.  Here's a little bit more background:

- we are in our early 30's.  

- the 350-thousand would eliminate nearly ALL of our savings.

- we still have 200-thousand in a retirement fund, but for the most part that money is untouchable until we ourselves retire.

- my wife is a federal employee and her work is incredibly steady and secure.

- I am a video editor and my work is much more fluid, but when I am busy, I am busy and the pay is good.

- There is also the strong possibility that we will be moving overseas within the next 2-3 years, at which point, we would no longer be paying rent, for the duration of our tour abroad.


Right now we are leaning towards doing it.  It just seems like a tremendous opportunity to double our money straight away, plus whatever increase in value the property gains over the next 10-20-30 years.  But there is a little voice in the back of my head that is also very apprehensive of tying up nearly all of our savings like that.  Plus, this may seem a bit silly, but having just seen Mad Max, there is also the concern over Climate Change just going bananas and suddenly Palm Springs is no longer a destination spot, but rather just a ghost town in the middle of the desert.

So there you have it.  I know it's a lot of information and I know at the end of the day, it's an incredibly personal choice -- really just wanted to see if maybe anyone has been in a similar situation or has any perspective or advice on using the vast majority of their savings to do something like this.

The current interest rate on the Direct Unsubsidized Loan is a fixed 6.21%, and that the interest accrues on the loan or must be paid while you are enrolled in school or in your grace period.  The current interest rate on the Direct Graduate Plus Loan is a fixed 7.21%, and it also accrues interest while you are enrolled or in your grace period.  The origination fee on the Unsubsidized Direct Loan is 1.07%, while the origination fee on the Direct Graduate Plus Loan is 4.29%.  Although the interest rates on these loans change every July 1, the rate in effect when the loan is originated, is the rate for the life of the loan.",finance,1434994845

personalfinance,"Looking to buy a car and get a credit card, looking for advice!","Hello wonderful people of PF!

I’ve been a long time lurker here and I’ve learned so much in such a short time from being in this sub. This is my first post here so please be gentle!

 

A few details about me: Currently a college student that will be entering my 3rd year in January. Have an internship that will end late November, paying $19/hr. Rent is $400/month. The only outstanding debt I have is federal student loans, which I don’t have to start paying until I graduate in two years – or three if I decide to pursue a masters (my school has a blended program where you can take graduate classes earlier and finish your masters in 5 years). I currently have $4K in savings.

 

So I have a few questions for you all! First, I am looking at buying a used car. I’ve gotten pre-approved for a $6K loan at 5.2% interest, and my parents have agreed to help me with $5K. I’m currently borrowing their van for work (it has terrible gas mileage), and I would like to get a smaller car that has much better gas mileage (any car could beat it by 2x or 3x really…). I’m thinking of purchasing a car around $10K. Is this a financially sound decision? Also, would it be better to spend a little more for a newer car (I’m thinking $15K for a 2013-2014 model car) so I don’t have to worry about maintenance issues as much? Insurance will be split half and half between me and my parents. I intend to do this before mid-July.

 

Secondly, I’m also considering getting a credit card. I’m very responsible financially, I don’t spend very much at all aside from necessities, and I know to pay my balances in full. I’m currently using a debit card to purchase everything (yes I know this is a terrible idea, hence I’m trying to change). However, I don’t know if this is a good idea given I’m currently trying to finance a car. Would this be advisable? From financing the car I know my credit score is just below 700 if that helps (which was a surprise to me because I haven’t had any credit). What card could/should I get?

 
Third, should I pursue my masters? I'm working towards a degree in computer science and was wondering if the masters is worth the extra year and debt to get. Benefits would be not having to pay off the loan an extra year and the degree itself, cons are that it's one less year working and whether or not it will be worth it.

personalfinance,Help with refinance,"I am looking to refinance, and wanted some input.  My main goal is to lower my monthly payment and remove pmi whole not giving up too much or any equitybut I want to ensure I'm not missing something important.  My home is now worth 270k conservatively:

Purchase Date: 06/2013

Purchase Price: $238,000

Payoff: $208,000

Interest rate:  4.875%

Principal + Interest:  $1133.56

PMI: $78 / month

Payoff: $211,200 ($2700 closing costs)

Out of Pocket CC: $450 (appraisal + Credit check)

Interest Rate: 4.25%

Principal + Interest: $1032.24

PMI: $0

Monthly Savings: $101.32+78 = ~$180.00 / month

 

Refinance Lendor 2 (“no out of pocket costs”)

Interest Rate: 4.625%

Principal + Interest:  $1082

PMI: $0

Monthly Savings:  ~$130 / month

 

My main question is the new payoff amount.  I know there is no real such thing as a “no closing cost” refinance, but with lendor #1 (who my current mortgage is with) are essentially adding $2200 into the loan, but stating I do not owe a mortgage payment that month (would be $1,315 with escrow included).

The second lendor has a higher rate, but is stating the the increased payoff amount is due to to then creating escrow account (I would get back $1350 from my current lendor) and due to interest not being paid in the month I do not make the mortgage payment.

 

I plan to live in this condo for 2-5 years, can anyone give me some input on what they woul do?  My main goal is to lower monthly payment (and get rid of PMI), but don’t want to give up too much equity.  I know they are adding an amount to my loan, but I also am not paying a mortgage payment for a month, and I really don’t care about starting back at 30 years since im only at 28 now and do not plan to get anywhere close to the end of this loan.",finance,1435003191
personalfinance,Need advice about saving and spending in the mid-twenties,"My spouse and myself are in our mid-twenties. We don't plan on kids until 30's, and wanted to have a few fun years of living in the middle of the city so we sprung for an apartment that's more expensive than we initially planned, but it's a great location. I just want advice on how to prioritize paying debts and saving from the place we're currently at.

The income/savings facts:

* Combined pre-tax income of around $110K
* Both stable jobs with raises promised in 1 year - likely be making close to $140K pre-tax
* Current take-home pay of around $6K each month
* I currently have $20K in my 401K 
* I contribute to Employee Stock Purchase and have $3.5K in that so far
* I have $500 in savings (just started working on building an emergency fund)
* Spouse just started work - so as of now, no 401k, etc.
* Due to spouse's education/living costs - my ability to save has been non-existent for a few years

The (major) expenses/source of my question:

* Rent of $1,800 per month - like I said, we wanted around $1,300 per month - but decided to live a little and spring for the insane location 
* I have $7K in credit card debt from wedding, moving, getting-carried-away-with-the-credit-card (no longer use cards - they aren't maxed or anything though)
* We have student loans of $80K (both college grads, spouse has a masters) 
* I have car loan of $20K @ 2%

My work gave us access to a budgeting tool (HelloWallet) which is really nice. It provides guidance on reaching your financial goals, and makes suggestions on prioritizing. It says our first step is starting an emergency savings of 1 month's combined pay. It suggested we should consider stopping contributing to our 401k's until we have that one month of pay in our savings. I'm just wondering if that's a good idea? Should I prioritize emergency savings and ignore credit card debt with high interest rates? How do we move forward once the ""pressing"" debt/savings issues are resolved? Do you prioritize 401K saving or paying down student loans, etc.?

I moved in with my GF (now wife) a few years ago and I had zero CC debt, $15k in the bank, and 780-800 credit score.  I then added her to credit cards's, didn't have the intestinal fortitude to tell her no, now I am in ~35k CC debt.  

I have now (finally) taken the cards and moved all the money into my personal checking account, as well as all the re-occurring bills, and will be paying everything from there.  I am not sure what the outcome of our marriage will be at this point, but that's not why I'm here, just trying to provide potentially relevant information.

Income:
*   $44,000/yr (with bonuses of ~$2-3,000/yr)
*   bring home ~$2,600/mo (pre-bonuses)
*   ---pay deductions: ~200/mo 401k, ~300/mo wife's health insurance (mine is covered by firm)
*   Wife makes ~1,200/mo plus some side work at a few hundred/mo but contributes minimal, if anything, so don't count this into any payoff calculations at this time
*   Usually $1,000-2,000 back with taxes

Note: This ever-accumulating debt plus my marriage is mentally draining me right now, but once I am able to settle down and focus again, I will be able to get a license for work after about a year's time that will bump my pay ~25-40%.

*   $14,700 Home Equity Loan @ 6.63% ($15,000 loan slightly paid down)
Note, the above loan will revert into the HELOC in about 2 years time as the loan was only good for 3 years.
*   $7,755 CC#1 @ 14.24% and $100/yr fee ($8,000 limit)
*   $6,000 CC#2 @ 15.24% ($6,500 limit)
*   $3,853 CC#3 @ ~22-24% ($4,000 limit)

*   $87,600 Mortgage @ 5.25% (purchased house for $100k, could sell for ~$130-140k)

*   I also have a CC#4 with nothing on it, with $4,500 credit limit which recently offered a 5% balance transfer for like 15 months @ 0% interest (if I remember the details correctly)
*   Wife doesn't have access to CC's or cash anymore so there will be no more unexpected holes in my budget bucket

I have some substantial loans from my first degree that are currently deferred because I am back in school. They are ungrouped and I can see that some have 5-6% interest while others are lower. I have paid off the two unsubsidized loans at 6.8% interest, but now that those are taken care of I am not sure how to proceed. 

Next year will be my final year before I return to the job market. The interest rate on federal loans will be 4.29%. Should I take out the max loan, then apply the refund toward the higher interest loans? How do I tell whether it's best to pay toward the lower interest but unsubsidized and accruing loans, or the higher interest but subsidized and currently not accruing interest loans?

personalfinance,"What to do with $70,000?","Hey, all. I'm hoping for some advice on what to do in my current financial situation. I'm about to receive $70,000 from my grandparents' estate. Here's some background information about me:

&amp;nbsp;

- 27 year old single male.
- Just finished my BA last month (two majors: Analytic Philosophy and Middle East Studies). Neither of these are likely to land me a high-paying job straight away.
- No debt.
- Average credit.
- Unemployed (just finished going to school full-time)

&amp;nbsp;

As I mentioned, my last three years have been spent working on a BA. Prior to that, I was in the Army for five years. So I know a whole lot about military maneuvers, metaphysics, and mideast mayhem but unfortunately not so much about money. 

&amp;nbsp;

Clearly what I should do with the money depends on what I want to do for a career and by extension what my income is going to look like over the next few years. The problem is that I just don't know. I may go to law school, try to start a business, land a federal job, or even go on to earn a PhD. I'll figure it out soon. However the check for $70k is here and I need to do something with it. For the next few weeks, I'll just leave it in a savings account.

&amp;nbsp;

But then what? What are some initial good decisions I can make despite the fact that I don't know exactly where my life is going in the next few years? Are there any no-brainer moves I need to make in the short term? These are the sorts of questions I'm hoping you guys and girls will help me with.

personalfinance,Company 401(k) - Roth or Traditional,"Evening Folks,

First I would like to thank this community dearly for the invaluable knowledge it's provided me (convinced me to buy YNAB which has been a tremendous help in the ongoing practice of financial discipline).  

My company began offering a 401(k) plan through Principal (which allows Roth 401k as well) earlier this year. I signed up and have had 10% of payroll deferred to my traditional 401(k) account. My income is $40,000/yr. The employer match is 100% of up to 3% of salary and 50% of 3-5%. My current balance is $1,800 ($2,500 with employer match, 4 year vesting period though).

I am 22 years old, and have been reading about the potential benefits of utilizing a Roth account (401k in this case) as a young adult, since the chances of being in a higher tax bracket during retirement is much more likely. I have heard the inverse to this as well, since retirement implies you are out of your working prime and your income level and expenses have potentially reduced.

I believe that I will be in a higher income bracket in my 60's (and that tax rates will go up in this time), and it seems best to contribute to the Roth 401k instead.  I have also heard that having both and splitting contributions (e.g. 5% in each) can help serve as a tax hedge so that I would not be too severely impacted at retirement regardless of either position.

My question is: Should I continue to contribute 10% to traditional 401k to take advantage of paying less taxes in the moment, as well as in case my bracket is lower in retirement, or 10% to Roth IRA and pay a bit more in taxes now, but be able to withdraw balance and gains tax free in retirement (provided it's qualified). 

The third option would be to just contribute 5% to receive employer-match, so that I can take home the other 5% to assist in creating an emergency fund, and then saving for self-education. My only debt with interest is car loan...which is a pre-computed loan (bought the car at 19 and I have learned the Rule of 78 the hard way, like most of life's lessons), which is not very beneficial to pay down aggressively. 

Any feedback is appreciated, and thank you all again for your contributions to this wonderful community!",finance,1435033514
personalfinance,"Try to convince me not to spend 45k on my dream car, or tell me its reasonable? Plus any other advice","EDIT UPDATE: Thanks all, gonna be smart and go with a used Dodge Challenger!


Hi PF, 

As the title says, I'm buying my first car in a couple of weeks. I know exactly which one I want, its fast, beautiful, and I'll love every inch of it. I still have to go look at them in person and test drive, but the cost brand new will be 35k to 45k (MAX), depending on the options/trim I decide upon. 

My situation:

22yo male

Gross: 95k, net probably 65 to 70, lets say ~4.5 to 5k a month after 401k contribution (currently maxing it out each paycheck, its Vanguard) Raise next year guaranteed.

I work 6 months a year away from home, other 6 months a year is paid vacation. 

No rent/mortgage for the next 3 to 5 years, but if I move out of my parents, I can live in any state, and willing to be frugal by living small/roommates/renting out, whatever. 

Budgeting... I live fairly frugally and can live off ~500 a month worth of food, gas, entertainment, alcohol (for the 6 months a year that I'm not working. The other 6 months everything is paid for by work as I'm traveling). Then add car loan payment and insurance I'm looking at 700 to 900 a month for the car alone. Yes that crazy...but look at my circumstances (no rent, etc), if I love the car, why not?

So total monthly spending would be about 900 for 6 months I'm at work, 1400 to 1600 for the 6 months of vacation. Leaving ~ 3600 to save each month (more on the months I work)

My cash savings are around 30,000. I'm comfortable with an emergency fund of as little as 5k in my current situation.
Job security is not something I need to currently worry much about.
 
Car down would cost 5k, trading in/sell my current car for 3k. Great credit + interest rate, not worried about that. 4 or 5 year loan, not decided. 

That leaves plenty in my monthly budget to save towards retirement and a condo down payment (3 to 6 years down the road).

So I'm torn. I COULD buy a used car, 3 to 6yrs old of the same model at $20 to 25k, but it will have at least 30 - 50k miles, not have the options I'd like, and the 2015 model has a MUCH improved interior. I wouldn't want to spend $25k and be unhappy with an older car with a shitty inside I'd have to look at every time I drive. 

Buying new I get: exactly the car I want, for years to come (maybe till it dies!), a great warranty, ZERO miles, all to myself. Not planning on selling it, not for at least after 6 years, if ever. 



Sorry thats so long or if I forgot any details or if its all confusing. Anyway, if you can convince me that I'm stupid for wanting this car, please do!! What would you do? And any other financial advice is welcome, I'm young and know I need to save aggressively, and currently doing that, just thinking of splurging on a car but don't want to regret it.",finance,1435035702

I know, I know, a healthy debate is healthy and all - and maybe I'm just not used to the tumult and jostling which would be inevitable in a real live open major debate about something as vital as Bitcoin.

And I really do agree with the starry-eyed idealists who say Bitcoin is *vital*. Imperfect as it may be, it certainly does seem to represent the first real chance we've had in the past few hundred years to try to steer our civilization and our planet away from the dead-ends and disasters which our government-issued debt-based currencies keep dragging us into.

We do have the bandwidth and the memory to at least increase the blocksize now, they say - and we're probably gonna continue to have more bandwidth and memory in order to be able to keep increasing the blocksize for another couple decades - pretty much like everything else computer-based we've seen over the years (some of this stuff is called by names such as ""Moore's Law"").

On the other hand, whenever the ""small-block"" supporters warn about the utter catastrophe that a failed hard-fork would mean, I get totally freaked by their possible doomsday scenarios, which seem totally plausible and terrifying - so I end up feeling that the only way I'd want to go with a hard-fork would be if there was some pre-agreed ""triggering"" mechanism where the fork itself would only actually ""switch on"" and take effect provided that some ""supermajority"" of the network (of who? the miners? the full nodes?) had signaled (presumably via some kind of totally reliable p2p trustless software-based voting system?) that they do indeed ""pre-agree"" to actually adopt the pre-scheduled fork (and thereby avoid *any* possibility whatsoever of the precious blockchain somehow tragically splitting into two and pretty much killing this cryptocurrency off in its infancy). 

So in this ""conservative"" scenario, I'm talking about wanting at least 95% pre-adoption agreement - not the mere 75% which I recall some proposals call for, which seems like it could easily lead to a 75/25 blockchain split.

But this time, with this long drawn-out blocksize debate, the core devs, and several other important voices who have become prominent opinion shapers over the past few years, can't seem to come to any real agreement on this.

**Weird split among the devs**

As far as I can see, there's this weird split: Gavin and Mike seem to be the only people among the devs who really want a major blocksize increase - and all the other devs seem to be vehemently against them. 

But then on the other hand, the *users* seem to be overwhelmingly in favor of a major increase. 

And there are meta-questions about governance, about about why this didn't come out as a BIP, and what the availability of Bitcoin XT means.

And today or yesterday there was this really cool big-blockian exponential graph based on doubling the blocksize every two years for twenty years, reminding us of the pure *mathematical* fact that 2^10 is indeed about 1000 - but not really addressing any of the *game-theoretic* points raised by the small-blockians. So a lot of the users seem to like it, but when so few devs say anything positive about it, I worry: is this just yet more exponential chart porn?

On the one hand, Gavin's and Mike's blocksize increase proposal initially seemed like a no-brainer to me.

And on the other hand, all the other devs seem to be against them. Which is weird - not what I'd initially expected at all (but maybe I'm just a fool who's seduced by exponential chart porn?). 

Look, I don't mean to be rude to any of the core devs, and I don't want to come off like someone wearing a tinfoil hat - but it has to cross people's minds that the powers that be (the Fed and the other central banks and the governments that use their debt-issued money to run this world into a ditch) could very well be much more scared shitless than they're letting on. If we assume that the powers that be are using their usual playbook and tactics, then it could be worth looking at the book ""Confessions of an Economic Hitman"" by John Perkins, to get an idea of how they might try to attack Bitcoin. So, what I'm saying is, they do have a track record of sending in ""experts"" to try to derail projects and keep everyone enslaved to the Creature from Jekyll Island. I'm just saying. So, without getting ad hominem - let's just make sure that our ideas can really stand scrutiny on their own - as Nick Szabo says, we need to make sure there is ""more computer science, less noise"" in this debate. 

When Gavin Andresen first came out with the 20 MB thing - I sat back and tried to imagine if I could download 20 MB in 10 minutes (which seems to be one of the basic mathematical and technological constraints here - right?) 

I figured, ""Yeah, I could download that"" - even with my crappy internet connection.

And I guess the telecoms *might* be nice enough to continue to double our bandwidth every two years for the next couple decades – if we ask them politely?

On the other hand - I think we should be careful about entrusting the financial freedom of the world into the greedy hands of the telecoms companies - given all their shady shenanigans over the past few years in many countries. After decades of the MPAA and the FBI trying to chip away at BitTorrent, lately PirateBay has been hard to access. I would say it's quite likely that certain persons at institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs and the Fed might be very, very motivated to see Bitcoin fail - so we shouldn't be too sure about scaling plans which depend on the willingness of companies Verizon and AT&amp;T to double our bandwith every two years. 

**Maybe the real important hardware buildout challenge for a company like 21 (and its allies such as Qualcomm) to take on now would not be ""a miner in every toaster"" but rather ""Google Fiber Download and Upload Speeds in every Country, including China"".**

I think I've read all the major stuff on the blocksize debate from Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Adam Back, and Jeff Garzick and several other major contributors - and, oddly enough, *all* their arguments seem reasonable - heck even Luke-Jr seems reasonable to me on the blocksize debate, and I always thought he was a whackjob overly influenced by superstition and numerology - and now today I'm reading the article by Bram Cohen - the inventor of BitTorrent - and I find myself agreeing with him too!

I say to myself: What's going on with me? How can I possibly agree with *all* of these guys, if they all have such vehemently opposing viewpoints?

I mean, think back to the glory days of a couple of years ago, when all we were hearing was how this amazing unprecedented grassroots innovation called Bitcoin was going to benefit everyone from all walks of life, all around the world: 

- wealthy individuals trying to preserve and transport their wealth across space and across time

- iPhone and Android users who want to buy a latte on their smartphone at Starbucks 

- Venezuelans and Argentinians and Cypriots and Russian oligarchs and Greeks and anyone else whose state-backed currency sucks 

- unbanked Africans who will someday be texting around money via SMS messages on their cellphones 

- online content providers who will finally be able to get paid via micropayments

- smart contracts and stock brokering and lawyering and land deeding and the refrigerator calling out to order more milk and distributed anonymous corporations (DACs) automatically negotiating and adjusting driverless taxicab fares in the Uber-future of the Internet of Things

...basically the entire human race transacting everything into the blockchain.

(Although let me say that I think that people's focus on ideas like driverless cabs creating realtime fare markets based on supply and demand seems to be setting our sights a bit low as far as Bitcoin's abilities to correct the financial world's capital-misallocation problems which seem to have been made possible by infinite debt-based fiat. I would have hoped that a Bitcoin-based economy would solve much more noble, much more urgent capital-allocation problems than driverless taxicabs creating fare markets or refrigerators ordering milk on the internet of things. I was thinking more along the lines that Bitcoin would finally strangle dead-end debt-based deadly-toxic energy industries like fossil fuels and let profitable clean energy industries like Thorium LFTRs take over - but that's another topic. :=)

**Paradoxes in the blocksize debate**

Let me summarize the major paradoxes I see here:

(1) Regarding the people (the majority of the core devs) who are *against* a blocksize increase: Well, the small-blocks arguments do seem kinda weird, and certainly not very ""populist"", in the sense that: When on earth have end-users ever heard of a computer technology whose capacity didn't grow pretty much exponentially year-on-year? All the cool new technology we've had - from hard drives to RAM to bandwidth - started out pathetically tiny and grew to unimaginably huge over the past few decades - and all our software has in turn gotten massively powerful and big and complex (sometimes bloated) to take advantage of the enormous new capacity available. 

But now suddenly, for the first time in the history of technology, we seem to have a majority of the devs, on a major *p2p* project - saying: ""Let's not scale the system up. It could be dangerous. It might break the whole system (if the hard-fork fails).""

I don't know, maybe I'm missing something here, maybe someone else could enlighten me, but I don't think I've ever seen this sort of thing happen in the last few decades of the history of technology - devs arguing *against* scaling up p2p technology to take advantage of expected growth in infrastructure capacity.

(2) But... on the other hand... the dire warnings of the small-blockians about what could happen if a hard-fork were to *fail* - wow, they do seem really dire! And these guys are pretty much all heavyweight, experienced programmers and/or game theorists and/or p2p open-source project managers. 

I must say, that nearly all of the long-form arguments I've read - as well as many, many of the shorter comments I've read from many users in the threads, whose names I at least have come to more-or-less recognize over the past few months and years on reddit and bitcointalk - have been amazingly impressive in their ability to analyze all aspects of the lifecycle and management of open-source software projects, bringing up lots of serious points which I could never have come up with, and which seem to come from long experience with programming and project management - as well as dealing with economics and human nature (eg, greed - the game-theory stuff). 

So a lot of really smart and experienced people with major expertise in various areas ranging from programming to management to game theory to politics to economics have been making some serious, mature, compelling arguments. 

But, as I've been saying, the only problem to me is: in many of these cases, these arguments are vehemently in opposition to each other! So I find myself agreeing with pretty much all of them, one by one - which means the end result is just a giant contradiction.

I mean, today we have Bram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent, arguing (quite cogently and convincingly to me), that it would be dangerous to increase the blocksize. And this seems to be a guy who would know a few things about scaling out a massive global p2p network - since the protocol which he invented, BitTorrent, is now apparently responsible for like a third of the traffic on the internet (and this despite the long-term concerted efforts of major evil players such as the MPAA and the FBI to shut the whole thing down).

**Was the BitTorrent analogy too ""glib""?**

By the way - I would like to go on a slight tangent here and say that one of the main reasons why I felt so ""comfortable"" jumping on the Bitcoin train back a few years ago, when I first heard about it and got into it, was the whole rough analogy I saw with BitTorrent. 

I remembered the perhaps paradoxical fact that when a torrent is *more* popular (eg, a major movie release that just came out last week), then it actually becomes *faster* to download. More people want it, so more people have a few pieces of it, so more people are able to get it from each other. A kind of self-correcting economic feedback loop, where more demand directly leads to more supply.

(BitTorrent manages to pull this off by essentially adding a certain structure to the file being shared, so that it's not simply like an append-only *list* of 1 MB blocks, but rather more like an random-access or indexed *array* of 1 MB chunks. Say you're downloading a film which is 700 MB. As soon as your ""client"" program has downloaded a single 1-MB chunk - say chunk #99 - your ""client"" program instantly turns into a ""server"" program as well - offering that chunk #99 to other clients. From my simplistic understanding, I believe the Bitcoin protocol does something similar, to provide a p2p architecture. Hence my - perhaps naïve - assumption that Bitcoin already had the right algorithms / architecture / data structure to scale.)

The efficiency of the BitTorrent network seemed to jive with that ""network law"" (Metcalfe's Law?) about fax machines. This law states that the more fax machines there are, the more valuable the network of fax machines becomes. Or the value of the network grows on the order of the square of the number of nodes. 

This is in contrast with other technology like cars, where the *more* you have, the *worse* things get. The more cars there are, the more traffic jams you have, so things start going downhill. I guess this is because highway space is limited - after all, we can't pave over the entire countryside, and we never did get those flying cars we were promised, as David Graeber laments in a recent essay in The Baffler magazine :-) 

And regarding the ""stress test"" supposedly happening right now in the middle of this ongoing blocksize debate, I don't know what worries me more: the fact that it apparently is taking only $5,000 to do a simple kind of DoS on the blockchain - or the fact that there are a few rumors swirling around saying that the unknown company doing the stress test shares the same physical mailing address with a ""scam"" company?

Or maybe we should just be worried that so much of this debate is happening on a handful of forums which are controlled by some guy named theymos who's already engaged in some pretty ""contentious"" or ""controversial"" behavior like blowing a million dollars on writing forum software (I guess he never heard that reddit.com software is open-source)?

So I worry that the great promise of ""decentralization"" might be more fragile than we originally thought. 

**Scaling**

Anyways, back to Metcalfe's Law: with virtual stuff, like torrents and fax machines, the more the merrier. The more people downloading a given movie, the faster it arrives - and the more people own fax machines, the more valuable the overall fax network.

So I kindof (naïvely?) assumed that Bitcoin, being ""virtual"" and p2p, would somehow scale up the same magical way BitTorrrent did. I just figured that more people using it would somehow automatically make it stronger and faster.

But now a lot of devs have started talking in terms of the old ""scarcity"" paradigm, talking about blockspace being a ""scarce resource"" and talking about ""fee markets"" - which seems kinda scary, and antithetical to much of the earlier rhetoric we heard about Bitcoin (the stuff about supporting our favorite creators with micropayments, and the stuff about Africans using SMS to send around payments).

Look, when some asshole is in line in front of you at the cash register and he's holding up the line so they can run his *credit card* to buy a bag of Cheeto's, we tend to get pissed off at the guy - clogging up our expensive global electronic payment infrastructure to make a two-dollar purchase. And that's on a fairly efficient centralized system - and presumably after a year or so, VISA and the guy's bank can delete or compress the transaction in their SQL databases.

Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but if some guy buys a coffee on the blockchain, or if somebody pays an online artist $1.99 for their work - then that transaction, a few bytes or so, has to live on the blockchain forever? 

Or is there some ""pruning"" thing that gets rid of it after a while?

And this could lead to another question: Viewed from the perspective of double-entry bookkeeping, is the blockchain ""world-wide ledger"" more like the ""balance sheet"" part of accounting, i.e. a *snapshot* showing *current* assets and liabilities? Or is it more like the ""cash flow"" part of accounting, i.e. a *journal* showing *historical* revenues and expenses?

When I think of thousands of machines around the globe having to lug around multiple identical copies of a multi-gigabyte file containing some asshole's coffee purchase forever and ever... I feel like I'm ideologically drifting in one direction (where I'd end up also being against really cool stuff like online micropayments and Africans banking via SMS)... so I don't want to go there. 

But on the other hand, when really experienced and battle-tested veterans with major experience in the world of open-souce programming and project management (the ""small-blockians"") warn of the catastrophic consequences of a possible failed hard-fork, I get freaked out and I wonder if Bitcoin really was destined to be a settlement layer for big transactions.

**Could the original programmer(s) possibly weigh in?**

And I don't mean to appeal to authority - but heck, where the hell is Satoshi Nakamoto in all this? I do understand that he/she/they would want to maintain absolute anonymity - but on the other hand, I assume SN wants Bitcoin to succeed (both for the future of humanity - or at least for all the bitcoins SN allegedly holds :-) - and I understand there is a way that SN can cryptographically sign a message - and I understand that as the original developer of Bitcoin, SN had some very specific opinions about the blocksize... So I'm kinda wondering of Satoshi could weigh in from time to time. Just to help out a bit. I'm not saying ""Show us a sign"" like a deity or something - but damn it sure would be fascinating and possibly very helpful if Satoshi gave us his/her/their 2 satoshis worth at this really confusing juncture.

**Are we using our capacity wisely?**

I'm not a programming or game-theory whiz, I'm just a casual user who has tried to keep up with technology over the years. 

It just seems weird to me that here we have this massive supercomputer (500 times more powerful than the all the supercomputers in the world combined) doing fairly straightforward ""embarassingly parallel"" number-crunching operations to secure a p2p world-wide ledger called the blockchain to keep track of a measly 2.1 quadrillion tokens spread out among a few billion addresses - and a couple of years ago you had people like Rick Falkvinge saying the blockchain would someday be supporting multi-million-dollar letters of credit for international trade and you had people like Andreas Antonopoulos saying the blockchain would someday allow billions of ""unbanked"" people to send remittances around the village or around the world dirt-cheap - and now suddenly in June 2015 we're talking about blockspace as a ""scarce resource"" and talking about ""fee markets"" and partially centralized, corporate-sponsored ""Level 2"" vaporware like Lightning Network and some mysterious company is ""stess testing"" or ""DoS-ing"" the system by throwing away a measly $5,000 and suddenly it sounds like the whole system could eventually head right back into PayPal and Western Union territory again, in terms of expensive fees.

When I got into Bitcoin, I really was heavily influenced by vague analogies with BitTorrent: I figured everyone would just have tiny little like utorrent-type program running on their machine (ie, Bitcoin-QT or Armory or Mycelium etc.). 

I figured that just like anyone can host a their own blog or webserver, anyone would be able to host their own bank. 

Yeah, Google and and Mozilla and Twitter and Facebook and WhatsApp did come along and build stuff on top of TCP/IP, so I did expect a bunch of companies to build layers on top of the Bitcoin protocol as well. But I still figured the basic unit of bitcoin client software powering the overall system would be small and personal and affordable and p2p - like a bittorrent client - or at the most, like a cheap server hosting a blog or email server.

And I figured there would be a way at the software level, at the architecture level, at the algorithmic level, at the data structure level - to let the thing scale - if not infinitely, at least fairly massively and gracefully - the same way the BitTorrent network has. 

Of course, I do also understand that with BitTorrent, you're sharing a read-only object (eg, a movie) - whereas with Bitcoin, you're achieving distributed trustless consensus and appending it to a write-only (or append-only) database.

So I do understand that the problem which BitTorrent solves is much simpler than the problem which Bitcoin sets out to solve.

But still, it seems that there's *got* to be a way to make this thing scale. It's p2p and it's got 500 times more computing power than all the supercomputers in the world combined - and so many brilliant and motivated and inspired people want this thing to succeed! And Bitcoin could be our civilization's last chance to steer away from the oncoming debt-based ditch of disaster we seem to be driving into!

It just seems that Bitcoin has *got* to be able to scale somehow - and all these smart people working together should be able to come up with a solution which pretty much everyone can agree - in advance - *will* work. 

Right? Right?


**A (probably irrelevant) tangent on algorithms and architecture and data structures**

I'll finally weigh with my personal perspective - although I might be biased due to my background (which is more on the theoretical side of computer science).

My own modest - or perhaps radical - suggestion would be to ask whether we're really looking at all the best possible algorithms and architectures and data structures out there. 

From this perspective, I sometimes worry that the overwhelming majority of the great minds working on the programming and game-theory stuff might come from a rather specific, shall we say ""von Neumann"" or ""procedural"" or ""imperative"" school of programming (ie, C and Python and Java programmers). 

It seems strange to me that such a cutting-edge and important computer project would have so little participation from the great minds at the *other* end of the spectrum of programming paradigms - namely, the ""functional"" and ""declarative"" and ""algebraic"" (and co-algebraic!) worlds. 

For example, I was struck in particular by statements I've seen here and there (which seemed rather hubristic or lackadaisical to me - for something as important as *Bitcoin*), that the *specification* of Bitcoin and the blockchain doesn't really exist in any form other than the reference *implementation(s)* (in *procedural* languages such as C or Python?).

**Curry-Howard anyone?**

I mean, many computer scientists are aware of the Curry-Howard isomorophism, which basically says that the relationship between a theorem and its proof is equivalent to the relationship between a specification and its implementation. In other words, there is a long tradition in mathematics (and in computer programming) of:

- separating the compact (and easy-to-check) statement of a theorem from the messy (and hard-to-check) details of its proof(s);

- separating the specification of a system from its implementation(s); and

- being able to *prove* that an implementation does indeed satisfy its specification. 

And it's not exactly ""turtles all the way down"" either: a specification is generally simple and compact enough that a good programmer can usually simply visually inspect it to determine if it is indeed ""correct"" - something which is very difficult, if not impossible, to do with a program written in a procedural, implementation-oriented language such as C or Python or Java.

So I worry that we've got this tradition, from the open-source github C/Java programming tradition, of never actually writing our ""specification"", and only writing the ""implementation"". In mission-critical military-grade programming projects (which often use languages like Ada or Maude) this is simply not allowed. It would seem that a project as mission-critical as Bitcoin - which could literally be crucial for humanity's continued survival - should also use this kind of military-grade software development approach.

And I'm not saying rewrite the implementations in these kind of theoretical languages. But it might be helpful if the C/Python/Java programmers in the Bitcoin imperative programming world could build some bridges to the Maude/Haskell/ML programmers of the functional and algebraic programming worlds to see if any kind of useful cross-pollination might take place - between specifications and implementations.

For example, the JavaFAN formal analyzer for multi-threaded Java programs (developed using tools based on the Maude language) was applied to the Remote Agent AI program aboard NASA's Deep Space 1 shuttle, written in Java - and it took only a few minutes using formal mathematical reasoning to detect a potential deadlock which would have occurred years later during the space mission when the damn spacecraft was already way out around Pluto.

And ""the Maude-NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) Protocol Analyzer (Maude-NPA) is a tool used to provide security proofs of cryptographic protocols and to search for protocol flaws and cryptosystem attacks.""

These are open-source formal reasoning tools developed by DARPA and used by NASA and the US Navy to ensure that program implementations satisfy their specifications. It would be great if some of the people involved in these kinds of projects could contribute to help ensure the security and scalability of Bitcoin.

But there is a wide abyss between the kinds of programmers who use languages like Maude and the kinds of programmers who use languages like C/Python/Java - and it can be really hard to get the two worlds to meet. There is a bit of rapprochement between these language communities in languages which might be considered as being somewhere in the middle, such as Haskell and ML. I just worry that Bitcoin might be turning into being an exclusively C/Python/Java project (with the algorithms and practitioners traditionally of that community), when it could be more advantageous if it also had some people from the functional and algebraic-specification and program-verification community involved as well. The thing is, though: the theoretical practitioners are big on ""semantics"" - I've heard them say stuff like ""Yes but a C / C++ program has no easily identifiable semantics"". So to get them involved, you really have to first be able to talk about *what* your program does (specification) - before proceeding to describe *how* it does it (implementation). And writing high-level specifications is typically very hard using the syntax and semantics of languages like C and Java and Python - whereas specs are fairly easy to write in Maude - and not only that, they're executable, and you state and verify properties about them - which provides for the kind of debate Nick Szabo was advocating (""more computer science, less noise""). 

**Imagine if we had an *executable algebraic specification of Bitcoin in Maude*, where we could formally reason about and verify certain crucial game-theoretical properties - rather than merely hand-waving and arguing and deploying and praying.**

And so in the theoretical programming community you've got major research on various logics such as Girard's Linear Logic (which is resource-conscious) and Bruni and Montanari's Tile Logic (which enables ""pasting"" bigger systems together from smaller ones in space and time), and executable algebraic specification languages such as Meseguer's Maude (which would be perfect for game theory modeling, with its functional modules for specifying the deterministic parts of systems and its system modules for specifiying non-deterministic parts of systems, and its parameterized skeletons for sketching out the typical architectures of mobile systems, and its formal reasoning and verification tools and libraries which have been specifically applied to testing and breaking - and fixing - cryptographic protocols).

And somewhat closer to the practical hands-on world, you've got stuff like Google's MapReduce and lots of Big Data database languages developed by Google as well. And yet here we are with a mempool growing dangerously big for RAM on a single machine, and a 20-GB append-only list as our database - and not much debate on practical results from Google's Big Data databases. 

(And by the way: maybe I'm totally ignorant for asking this, but I'll ask anyways: why the hell does the mempool have to stay in RAM? Couldn't it work just as well if it were stored temporarily on the hard drive?)

And you've got CalvinDB out of Yale which apparently provides an ACID layer on top of a massively distributed database.

Look, I'm just an armchair follower cheering on these projects. I can barely manage to write a query in SQL, or read through a C or Python or Java program. But I would argue two points here: (1) these languages may be too low-level and ""non-formal"" for writing and modeling and formally reasoning about and proving properties of mission-critical *specifications* - and (2) there seem to be some Big Data tools already deployed by institutions such as Google and Yale which support global petabyte-size databases on commodity boxes with nice properties such as near-real-time and ACID - and I sometimes worry that the ""core devs"" might be failing to review the literature (and reach out to fellow programmers) out there to see if there might be some formal program-verification and practical Big Data tools out there which could be applied to coming up with rock-solid, 100% consensus proposals to handle an issue such as blocksize scaling, which seems to have become much more intractable than many people might have expected. 

I mean, the protocol solved the hard stuff: the elliptical-curve stuff and the Byzantine General stuff. How the heck can we be falling down on the comparatively ""easier"" stuff - like scaling the blocksize? 

It just seems like defeatism to say ""Well, the blockchain is already 20-30 GB and it's gonna be 20-30 TB ten years from now - and we need 10 Mbs bandwidth now and 10,000 Mbs bandwidth 20 years from - assuming the evil Verizon and AT&amp;T actually give us that - so let's just become a settlement platform and give up on buying coffee or banking the unbanked or doing micropayments, and let's push all that stuff into some corporate-controlled vaporware without even a whitepaper yet.""

So you've got Peter Todd doing some possibly brilliant theorizing and extrapolating on the idea of ""treechains"" - there is a Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast from about a year ago where he sketches the rough outlines of this idea out in a very inspiring, high-level way - although the specifics have yet to be hammered out. And we've got Blockstream also doing some hopeful hand-waving about the Lightning Network.

Things like Peter Todd's treechains - which may be similar to the spark in some devs' eyes called Lightning Network - are examples of the kind of algorithm or architecture which *might* manage to harness the massive computing power of miners and nodes in such a way that certain kinds of massive and graceful scaling become possible. 

It just seems like a kindof tiny dev community working on this stuff. 

**Being a C or Python or Java programmer should not be a pre-req to being able to help contribute to the specification (and formal reasoning and program verification) for Bitcoin and the blockchain.** 

XML and UML are crap modeling and specification languages, and C and Java and Python are even worse (as *specification* languages - although as *implementation* languages, they are of course fine).

But there *are* serious modeling and specification languages out there, and they could be very helpful at times like this - where what we're dealing with is questions of modeling and specification (ie, ""needs and requirements""). 

One just doesn't often see the practical, hands-on world of open-source github implementation-level programmers and the academic, theoretical world of specification-level programmers meeting very often. I wish there were some way to get these two worlds to collaborate on Bitcoin. 

Maybe a good first step to reach out to the theoretical people would be to provide a modular executable algebraic specification of the Bitcoin protocol in a recognized, military/NASA-grade specification language such as Maude - because that's something the theoretical community can actually wrap their heads around, whereas it's very hard to get them to pay attention to something written *only* as a C / Python / Java implementation (without an accompanying specification in a  formal language). 

They can't check whether the program does what it's supposed to do - if you don't provide a formal mathematical definition of what the program is supposed to do.


**Specification : Implementation :: Theorem : Proof**

You have to remember: the theoretical community is *very* aware of the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Just like it would be hard to get a mathematician's attention by merely showing them a *proof* without telling also telling them what *theorem* the proof is proving - by the same token, it's hard to get the attention of a theoretical computer scientist by merely showing them an *implementation* without showing them the *specification* that it implements.

Bitcoin is currently confronted with a mathematical or ""computer science"" problem: how to secure the network while getting high enough transactional throughput, while staying within the limited RAM, bandwidth and hard drive space limitations of current and future infrastructure. 

**The problem only becomes a *political and economic* problem if we give up on trying to solve it as a *mathematical and ""theoretical computer science""* problem.**

There should be a plethora of whitepapers out now proposing algorithmic solutions to these scaling issues. Remember, all we have to do is apply the Byzantine General consensus-reaching procedure to a worldwide database which shuffles 2.1 quadrillion tokens among a few billion addresses. The 21 company has emphatically pointed out that racing to compute a hash to add a block is an ""embarrassingly parallel"" problem - very easy to decompose among cheap, fault-prone, commodity boxes, and recompose into an overall solution - along the lines of Google's highly successful MapReduce.

I guess what I'm really saying is (and I don't mean to be rude here), is that C and Python and Java programmers might not be the best qualified people to develop and formally prove the correctness of (note I do not say: ""test"", I say ""formally prove the correctness of"") these kinds of algorithms.

I really believe in the importance of getting the algorithms and architectures right - look at Google Search itself, it uses some pretty brilliant algorithms and architectures (eg, MapReduce, Paxos) which enable it to achieve amazing performance - on pretty crappy commodity hardware. And look at BitTorrent, which is truly p2p, where more demand leads to more supply. 

So, in this vein, I will close this lengthy rant with an oddly specific link - which may or may not be able to make some interesting contributions to finding suitable algorithms, architectures and data structures which might help Bitcoin scale massively. I have no idea if this link could be helpful - but given the near-total lack of people from the Haskell and ML and functional worlds in these Bitcoin specification debates, I thought I'd be remiss if I didn't throw this out - just in case there might be something here which could help us channel the massive computing power of the Bitcoin network in such a way as to enable us simply sidestep this kind of desperate debate where both sides seem right because the other side seems wrong.

https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/neil.ghani/papers/ghani-calco07

The above paper is about ""higher dimensional trees"". It uses a bit of category theory (not a whole lot) and a bit of Haskell (again not a lot - just a simple data structure called a Rose tree, which has a wikipedia page) to develop a very expressive and efficient data structure which generalizes from lists to trees to higher dimensions.

I have no idea if this kind of data structure could be applicable to the current scaling mess we apparently are getting bogged down in - I don't have the game-theory skills to figure it out. 

I just thought that since the blockchain is like a list, and since there are some tree-like structures which have been grafted on for efficiency (eg Merkle trees) and since many of the futuristic scaling proposals seem to also involve generalizing from list-like structures (eg, the blockchain) to tree-like structures (eg, side-chains and tree-chains)... well, who knows, there might be some nugget of algorithmic or architectural or data-structure inspiration there. 

**So... TL;DR:**

(1) I'm freaked out that this blocksize debate has splintered the community so badly and dragged on so long, with no resolution in sight, and both sides seeming so right (because the other side seems so wrong).

(2) I think Bitcoin could gain immensely by using high-level formal, algebraic and co-algebraic program specification and verification languages (such as Maude including Maude-NPA, Mobile Maude parameterized skeletons, etc.) to specify (and possibly also, to some degree, verify) *what* Bitcoin does - before translating to low-level *implementation* languages such as C and Python and Java saying *how* Bitcoin does it. This would help to communicate and reason about programs with much more mathematical certitude - and possibly obviate the need for many political and economic tradeoffs which currently seem dismally inevitable - and possibly widen the collaboration on this project.

(3) I wonder if there are some Big Data approaches out there (eg, along the lines of Google's MapReduce and BigTable, or Yale's CalvinDB), which could be implemented to allow Bitcoin to scale massively and painlessly - and to satisfy all stakeholders, ranging from millionaires to micropayments, coffee drinkers to the great ""unbanked"".

personalfinance,Story about the dangers of non-fee based financial planners,"Hello PF!  Just wanted to give you guys a story (and warning) about how ""financial planners"" can operate when they don't have their client's best interests at heart.  


So this is back in 2004, I was a young Navy officer about 1 year out of college.  My tax return tells me I made  27k that year, but it was probably closer to 40k when factoring in my housing/food allowance (that is not taxed).  My wife was making 20k/year, so household was about 60k/year.  We had no kids and both worked full-time.  I never had any real financial training so my wife and I spent too much money, we went out to eat all the time, went to bars, etc.  


We kind of woke-up one day and realized we were in trouble.  We were about 7k in CC debt, and had 2 car payments of about 15k and 25k (one was about 320/month, the other was about 550/month, yeah I know), and it was getting worse every month.  We didn't have the income to support our lifestyle.  I was talking to a co-worker and he suggested that I see ""his"" financial planner, this guy supposedly put his life on track and would be able to help me, I took the guys name/number and gave him a call.


We ended up going to this guy's office, he worked for a company called ""First Command"".  To a young Navy officer this guy was impressive.  He was a smart, well-spoken former Navy Commander (which made me automatically treat him as a senior or mentor).  I printed out all my bank/cc statements just like he asked and we sat down and went through them together.  He then told me about the 3 pillars of financial health (he described it like a 3-legged stool, if one leg was missing the stool could not stand), they were: Life Insurance, Retirement accounts, Low debt.  That made a ton of sense to me, although I was mostly concerned about the debt I figured he knew better.  


We left his office and he said he would take my numbers to their financial experts and they would come up with a ""complete package"" to get me on track.  Perfect, this was the first day of my newfound financial mastery!  A week later he called my young wife and I back, and he had a neat little binder with their 3 recommendations (based off the 3 pillars):

* **Take my 2 credit cards, and 2 car loans and consolodate them into 1 large loan (with them of course)**.  This one was a big concern for me because the interest rate on this loan was higher than both of my credit cards, and my car loans (as was the payment).  I was far from being a financial expert, but I knew this was not a good idea so I declined suggestion #1 (much to his annoyance).
* **Purchase 100k of whole life insurance for myself, and 50K of whole life insurance for my wife**.  Now as active duty military I had a 500k life insurance policy already, but my wife did not.  He made this whole-life insurance sound awesome, so I agreed to open a 50k whole life insurance policy for my wife (with them of course).
* **Start contributing to a Roth IRA**.  This is the one that I still kick myself over, there's obviously nothing wrong with a Roth IRA.  The main problem is that he wanted me to buy front-loaded mutual funds with a 50% front load.  For those of you not familiar with those (and I wasn't), for the first year you pay a 50% fee when you purchase the mutual funds, every year after that you pay 0% fee.  What this means is that when you purchase $100 worth, they take $50 and the other $50 goes into your Roth IRA.  He wanted me to keep buying these things for 30 years, so it didn't sound that bad that I would pay these high fees for the first year.  I ended up doing this as well, I forget how much I did, but I think I was putting in $100/month.

So one thing I didn't mention is fixing my budget issue, he didn't address it at all.  I asked him about it and he said once I get the debt paid down it'll be fine... that was his only suggestion.  In the mean time, I now had an extra $100 going to life insurance (which I didn't need) and $100 going to crappy front-loaded mutual funds, neither of which I could afford when trying to pay-down my crazy credit card debt.  

I had buyers remorse 1 month later on the life insurance and cancelled it, and about 4 months later with the Roth IRA, I ended up cashing it out (he convinced me not to cash-out the ""earnings"" so I probably have a few dollars sitting in an account somewhere).

Anyway that's my story, I'm sure most financial planners are not like this, and it was an expensive lesson but I'm sure I learned from it.

TLDR: Financial planner convinced a young guy in lots of debt to purchase crappy whole life insurance and front-loaded mutual funds.",finance,1435055752

For those of us in the actual Summer months now, how about that weather, huh?

For those of you heading into winter, feel free to camp beside your ASIC or video card with some marshmallows and warm cup of hot chocolate ;D)

We're in Week 4 of the [DOGE Days of Summer](http://i.imgur.com/4kLIxhh.jpg) and today is **Talk Dogecoin Tuesday**!

Today is a fantastic opportunity for us to really get out there and start to build on our niche as a 'starter' crypto-coin.  

In order for our DOGEconomy to grow, for our coin to have a stable base beneath it, we really need to focus on helping to expand the reach of our community.

And it's through taking advantage of, leveraging our fantastic, active, diverse community that we can help bring in people who have no idea what all this is about and educate them in a safe, positive space.

Cryptocurrency doesn't need to be this big scary question-mark.  Through Dogecoin we can open a world of self-education - one that not only teaches about finance, but one that allows us to look at money in a whole new way, as a form of fun and self-expression.

Thanks to our fellow Shibes and our vibrant Dogecoin community, we've shown that money is not just a blunt tool any more.

It can have real nuance - and its effects can be life-changing.

That's why one of the key things I really want to stress about today is how important it is to try and reach out to people who have no idea what cryptocurrency is.

That's why today's mission is so important.

Why we ask that you take the time to:

**Talk about Dogecoin to 1 new person today.**

Could be your mom, your best friend, your teacher or yes - for those of you bold enough to do it - even someone you don't know!

*No sales pitch involved.*

Just talk about what you genuinely like about Dogecoin.

To that end, what has been working for you so far?  What hasn't been?

Have you been receiving mostly positive or negative responses?

I'd like to remind you all that we've also got some pamphlets that the Summer Plan team put together!

personalfinance,"30yo in 35k CC debt, need game plan","A quick tl;dr of how I got here, 

I moved in with my GF (now wife) a few years ago and I had zero CC debt, $15k in the bank, and 780-800 credit score.  I then added her to credit cards's, didn't have the intestinal fortitude to tell her no, now I am in ~35k CC debt.  

I have now (finally) taken the cards and moved all the money into my personal checking account, as well as all the re-occurring bills, and will be paying everything from there.  I am not sure what the outcome of our marriage will be at this point, but that's not why I'm here, just trying to provide potentially relevant information.

Income:


* $44,000/yr (with bonuses of ~$2-3,000/yr)
* bring home ~$2,600/mo (pre-bonuses)
* ---pay deductions: ~200/mo 401k, ~300/mo wife's health insurance (mine is covered by firm)
* Wife ""brings home"" ~1,200/mo plus some side work at a few hundred/mo but contributes minimal, if anything, so don't count this into any payoff calculations at this time
* Usually $1,000-2,000 back with taxes

Note: This ever-accumulating debt plus my marriage is mentally draining me right now, but once I am able to settle down and focus again, I will be able to get a license for work after about a year's time that will bump my pay ~25-40%.

Cash/other:


* $4,500 personal checking account
* $1,000 personal savings
* $550 2nd personal savings account
* $43,000 401k

Debts:


* $3,300 HELOC @ 7.38% ($5,000 limit)
* $14,700 Home Equity Loan @ 6.63% ($15,000 loan originally)
Note, the above loan will revert into the HELOC in about 2 years time as the loan was only good for 3 years.
* $7,755 CC#1 @ 14.24% and $100/yr fee ($8,000 limit)
* $6,000 CC#2 @ 15.24% ($6,500 limit)
* $3,853 CC#3 @ ~22-24% ($4,000 limit)
CC#3 was taken by new bank, can't recall new interest rate but it's always been highest
* $87,600 Mortgage @ 5.25% (purchased house for $100k, could sell for ~$130-140k)

Note sure of credit score, don't trust the ""free"" sites, but I think it's in the 650-680 range, as of about 15 months ago

Expenses:


* $171/mo ($95/mo int chrg) for CC#1 min payment
* $121/mo ($74/mo int chrg) for CC#2 min payment
* $125/mo for CC#3 min payment
* $835/mo mortgage payment (144prin, 344int, 347escrow)
* $100/mo gas (commute 60mi/day 5days/wk for work)
* $75/mo lunch
* $13/mo MMO (video game) subscription
* $30-50/mo take-out dinner
* $45/mo dog food
* $150-200/mo groceries
* $182/mo electric
* $110/mo water
* $100/mo home equity loan
* $100/mo HELOC
* $60/mo life insurance
* $75/mo car insurance (wife's car)
* $261/mo car payment (leased 2013 Sonata)
* $50/mo home security
* $80/mo internet (could save $20/mo by downgrading)
* $100/mo lawn care
* $32/mo pest control
* $125/qtr HOA dues
* Mom pays my auto insurance
* Dad pays cell phone

Totals: $2,600 incoming/mo, and $2,850 outgoing/mo.

Notes:


* The HELOC is $5,000 with the $3,300 used on it, so there is also $1,700 I could transfer into for a lower rate.
* I also have a CC#4 with nothing on it, with $4,500 credit limit which recently offered a 5% balance transfer for like 15 months @ 0% interest (if I remember the details correctly)
* Wife doesn't have access to CC's or cash anymore so there will be no more unexpected holes in my budget bucket

I appreciate your help and advice, and I know this is going to be a long road ahead, but I really want to get my financial life back under control.

EDIT:  Thank you for all your replies, I will still be checking on them as you all are constantly giving good advice.  As of now, I have/will in the next week:

* downgraded internet - $20/mo savings
* purchase refurb'd lawnmower at Home Depot - $100/mo savings (after first 2 months)
* cancel pest control - $32/mo savings
* cancel life insurance - $60/mo savings
* cancel security - $50/mo savings
* remove myself from wife's car title and have her budget the insurance - $75/mo savings
* payoff CC#3 - $125/mo savings
* be more conscience of food spending - ~$50/mo savings

This will save ~$500/mo and barely push me back into the green.  If my wife starts contributing, and all tax refunds and bonuses goes towards paying off the debt (highest interest rate first I assume?), we should be on our way out of this hole.

Thank you again!",finance,1435065483
personalfinance,My FL apartment has something wrong; its causing my eyes &amp; sinuses inflammation. Apartment Manager senses nothing wrong.,"Hi reddit,  
I bring this issue to you because there is a lot of help that goes around here from a lot of experienced and knowledgeable people about a wide variety of issues. I hope that someone here can give me some specific guidance on what points of leverage I have as a renter in an unhealthy unit here in Florida.
  
I'm one month into a 12 month lease. I moved into the room after visiting the unit. I could not tell that there was going to be any trouble with the air quality in the unit on account of the walls having been freshly painted and the carpets cleaned during my visit.    
I'll keep the story as succinct as possible, I'm looking for any leverage points I may have in order to break the lease or have the apartment company pay for new carpet.  
  
Perhaps five days after moving into the apartment I was sure that there was a problem. Well, the ceiling fan was absolutely disgusting. It was old and it had become apparent that the unit was occupied by a smoker. The body and blades of the fan were caked in acrid black and brown dust. I told the appt mgr that it was a really bad fan, (and sorry for overlooking it), and she had it replaced.  

The wall unit A/C also needed to be cleaned on its insides and she ordered that done.

I also complained about the air quality. There is something in the air. I can feel it on the surfaces of my posessions; something in the air literally settles onto my body and things in the place. I informed her that my eyes were bloodshot and stinging. I can feel this stuff-in-the-air in my lungs, actually.   
I wake up each day with very, very red eyes. If I drink a coffee or work out strenuously, they become very badly red indeed.  
I've gone to her now and pointed all of this out, and she visited the apartment in order to check it out. Upon entrance, it is very easy to smell that the air is disgusting in the apartment.
She denies smelling anything.    

I asked her to touch the surfaces of tables, counters, etc in the apartment to feel the slippingness created by whatever is physically in the air causing this irritation.  
She looked into my eyes and denied that they were reddened. She also repeatedly attempted to state to me that it must be that I have a 'sensitive body'. I have not had any type of allergy or whathaveyou whatsoever. I plainly stated this to her and said that it is not the case that there is anything outside of a problem with the apartment present.  

I presented her with a note from an optometrist visit I made yesterday, which stated that I showed up with red irritated eyes.

The best offer I acquired from her through this was that she would pay for 1/2 of the cost of replacing the carpet. The biggest problem is that it may not even be the carpet that's causing the irritation.   
What if the irritant is something in the walls? Under the bathroom flooring or plumbing?  

It is true that there is no visible damage with the carpet.    
  
  
I am having trouble finding a distinct outline of what rights I leverage under federal and Florida law where I may be able to make this an issue worth settling for a 7 day no-fee break of the lease rather than two months with charges.
    
The problem with my irritated eyes causes me physical harm. I may now have or develop permanent cosmetic harm to the coloration of the sclera. I may develop chronic problems due to lengthy (i.e. the next 11 months of the lease) exposure to irritants which so far are causing inflammation and redness of my eyes and the area to the left and right of the bridge of my nose where the sinuses are. I can feel the trouble in my lungs. Etcetra etcetra, on the health fronts as to why this is a big deal for me.  
  
My performance at the local university in my accounting program and my start up (which involves personally selling to business owners) are being definitely harmed by the worsening of my condition.
  
  
I am a daring person. I am not afraid to present my case for what it is worth, which as far as I am concerned, is my life and livelihood. But I need some knowledge and places to points and direct the apartment manager's attention to as far as where I may go to seek the relief that is just and proper if she does not work to solve the problem at the apartment company's cost.

  
I'm having trouble finding all of the rights for building habitation, any requirements for a healthy living space, and so on, that I may use in presenting my case to the appt mgr. I need help in working the situation into causing her to replace the carpet at her cost (the carpet is likely to be, but may not be, the entire solution to what is harming me), or breaking the lease without fees and on short notice.    
  
My next rent payment is due July 2nd and I do not want to be putting anymore money into this without a solution.
  
  
Thanks for your help reddit.",finance,1435069183

personalfinance,Liquidating inherited assets for paying debt/buying house,"This isn’t a generic I have X what should I do with it—I have read that and this is more of a mix of debt, investing, and home buying and is also a throwaway for privacy reasons.


My dad recently passed and I am inheriting around $400k pretty much all tied up in the market and bonds (seems pretty diverse but I am a novice), etc. as well as potentially some way smaller amount of cash from the sale of his house.  I grew up very middle class and haven’t ever been taught much about how to handle these sorts of things-- a lot of this is from a trust set up for my sister, cousin, and I by my grandfather that has increased since his death 20 years ago but transferred to us upon the death of my dad. 


I currently make around 80k/year but will be making more like 300k/year at a minimum in 2-3 years. I have around 85k in professional school loans, approx.  8k in credit card debt (mostly from starting my career during the recession and making significantly less than I do now) that I am working to pay off first, and around 13k left on a car loan with a really good interest rate. Because of my school loan, car and card payments, I pretty much live paycheck to paycheck currently but live pretty comfortably and could probably be saving more/paying off more if I didn’t like to travel a bit and go out often for dinner/drinks. I know this is not in line with this subreddit’s usual advice but I do work a ton and those things provide sanity and I have pretty much zero risk regarding job security.  I am 32, unmarried (live with SO but no finances intertwined other than he pays me rent on my lease as I expect he would do if I bought a home), and no kids (for life). 


I would like to buy my first house sometime in the next six months-1 year by liquidating some of the assets for a down payment. Is that a terrible idea? If not, should I just do the 20% I would need or should I try to put down more?   Should I also use some of it to pay off the school/car debt even though over the next few years I should be able to do that without tapping into the assets?

They lost about 50% of their stock value when the recession hit in 2007, but have recovered most of that value.  Most of their money is in stocks from stock-sharing plans from previous employers, but also in stock-based mutual funds.  They earn a fair amount from dividends (about $5000 per year).  

They can't afford to take the hit of another recession.  Their goal is to put the money in a safe vehicle that will allow them to pass their money to their 3 children.  They're concerned because interest rates are so low, they don't keep pace with inflation.  They would also like to avoid having their heirs losing a large chunk to inheritance taxes.

* Taxes – I live in Illinois (3.75%), medicare/SS is 7.65%, and my federal tax rate at 42,500 is 16.59% for a total of 27.99%. This makes my post-tax take home 30,605.31 or 2,550.44/month.

If I go with the apartment I’ve been looking at but haven’t signed, 805/month for rent/utilities/internet/parking. This leaves me with 985/month fixed expenses, or 38.62% of my monthly income.

personalfinance,I don't know the first thing about money or managing it. I'm 24 and would like some advice.,"Hello,

I’ve been a long-time lurker and I really like this subreddit as it seems to give people a lot of good advice. I just don’t know how to apply it to me or my situation. I don’t know how to create a budget based on my income, how my boyfriend and I should be splitting bills (or even how to look at our combined income vs what’s going out), what I should be saving, etc. I literally have no idea how to manage my money. My parents are still paying some of my bills and my boyfriend has been paying the ones for our house. I, on the other hand, have just been spending most of my money irresponsibly for the last two months.

I don’t know what information you need or if there are ways for me to learn this stuff. Any help at all would be wonderful. I want to get married, have babies, and all that, but I want to prepare and I already feel like I’m behind in the game. I’ve included some information below. I’m not sure what all to look at or how to do anything.

I’m 24 years old and landed a job at the end of April with a good company that allows me to have the security of a job, room for promotions, pay raises, etc. With that being said, I currently only make $12.45/hr. I only have a $400 “cushion” in my bank account currently (when it gets close to $400 I just tell myself there’s $0). My actual pay checks are $740 every two weeks. That’s after taxes, insurance, and retirement are taken out (I’ve been putting away 3% for retirement—they match up to 5%). 

I bank at the same place my parents do simply because my parents bank there. I’m going on Friday to ask about their savings accounts and whether or not there are charges and how long it takes to access them (are there other things I need to know about savings accounts?)

My cell phone and my car insurance are paid by my parents. My dad bought my car and it is in his name. My parents offer me a lot of financial support and I want to get away from this. I feel like having them there is allowing me to further be irresponsible with my money. Anything can happen and I want to be able to support myself. Middle-class family entire life—never went without, but never had everything we wanted.

I live with my boyfriend. He owns our home. I don’t know what all I should know about our bills. I know roughly the amount, but he seems to shy away from telling me much about his finances—this is more because of mind-set/personality. He has it in his head that he has to be “provider/breadwinner.” I’m in a weird place where I want to know more, but don’t know what to look for, ask about, or know. He’s more than happy to allow me to know his financial situation, but we’re not actually married yet and I don’t want to get all of our stuff tied up until we do get married. We want to get married one day, but both know now is not the time. He just started two businesses and we’re trying to get on our feet. He’s irresponsible with his money too, though, and him starting two businesses without a head for figures makes me nervous. 

I owe on student loans—both private and federal. My federal loans are on an IBR plan (~$31,000 total). The payments are $0 a month. Should I still be paying on these? My private loan minimum payment is all I’ve been making. There are three of them: $51, $132, and $105—so ~$300 monthly. I was paying the one with the highest interest rate the most (instead of $51 I was paying $180, but that was at my previous job when my pay checks brought in more money). 

I really don’t know what other information to give… Is there somehow a way for me to learn or any advice? 

Thanks in advance.",finance,1435078860

I currently have ~11.5k in student loan debt and have been very good at repaying my loan payment of ~$104 a month. I have my two federal loans consolidated and I have to pay a 6.5% interest rate on them. This means that I am currently only paying ~$40 a month on the actual principal balance of the loan. I currently have a couple credit cards that offer 0% apr for another 12 months. Should I pay down some of these loans w/ my credit cards as i won't be paying interest on them?

personalfinance,My bank offered me a crazy personal loan amount (CAN),"I need to buy a new (to me) car as my current car is a 2002 Pontiac Sunfire that has recently tipped over into the not worth repairing category. My current car was the first car I bought and I did everything wrong when I bought it. This time around I knew I really needed to do my homework, about cars in general as well as finances. 

I make gross 45K-50K a year, I own my own house (My mortgage is about 55% of my house value) and I currently have about $9,000 in debt (down from 15,000 since the beginning of 2015) The debt will be paid by the end of the year and once it’s gone my focus will be to pay off the car in one year, increase my emergency fund at the same time and then focus on long term savings. (To give some background)

Originally I wanted to pay for my new used car with cash in another 6 months, but it requires some unexpected work now that I feel would be more expensive then it is worth so I decided to go with a loan. At this point I do not have a car picked out, but I have a ballpark cost I am comfortable with in my head, which is a maximum of about $12,000. 

So step one I contacted my bank to see what kind of personal loan I would qualify for and at what interest rate. I chose a personal loan, over a car loan specifically because I can pay it off as fast as I want with no penalty. So the representative told me first off I was in the top third of credit scores (that sounds about right since I have had a mortgage for 8 years, always solid employment, paid off my student loans a few decades early, never missed a payment on a bill and have had a credit card since I was 18)

Then he tells me I qualify for $51,400 for an unsecured personal loan – with the bank knowing that this would be used to purchase a car. (I would have to send them my insurance, VIN, make, model etc.. info)

Does that not seem slightly insane since that’s basically equal to my gross pay for an entire year? I mean I get my bank wants my business because I am a good customer, but it seems like that kind of offer might really screw someone who didn’t have a firm understanding of their finances. 

I am still a little surprised about the offer, and obviously will not be getting a loan for that ridiculous amount; I’m just kinda curious what their logic is behind that kind of offer?",finance,1435086213

personalfinance,Trying to sort out college finances. S.O.S.,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I am a college student who is looking to transfer out of a state school into a significantly more expensive private school. I have decent grades so I got $24,000 in merit scholarship from the school. The problem is that the price tag is about $66,000 per year.

The Financial aid package I received breaks down as follows:
24,000 - Merit Scholarship
4,500 - Federal subsidized loans
2,000 - Federal un-subsidized loans
2,000 - Work study
TOTAL: $32,500

So I'm left with 33.5k out of pocket for the year. My parents are only willing to pay around 10-15k out. I'm hoping to appeal the financial aid award to get slightly more, but there is no guarantee that a review will come out in my favor.

I'm considering additional private loans, but hope that a better option presents itself. I anticipate being in a position to pay them when I finish school (I'm pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering), but still have no desire to take on a mountain of debt.

I recently noticed the Discover savings account started offering a slightly better interest rate than that of the money market.  This didn't used to be the case.  What changed to make savings accounts offer a better rate?

It still saddens me that, after the 2008 crash, the interest in these types of accounts just never really recovered at all globally.  At best it seems to be they've only snailed up at increments of 0.01% at a time.  I do invest in other types of accounts but I would prefer to find the best long term option for my liquid / every day funds.  

I thought money markets gave the banks greater freedom to invest and earn a better profit but, from what I'm noticing, the benefits of this freedom for the bank is no longer benefiting the consumer as much.

My last outstanding balance on the credit card was just over 4300.  But it's been 10 years.  I'm trying to figure out the best way to handle this.

In Ontario, the statute of limitations on debts appears to be 2 years.  But the risk is always that you do something to reset the clock.  Also, having not really been tied to one location, I don't know if they got a judgment or not.

I don't even know who owns the debt right now, because I assume they sold it to a debt buyer.  The only clue I have at the moment is an old credit card statement.

I'm also concerned about interest, penalties, and my overall debt load.  (My other main debt is student loans).

My financial background:  
I've had a secured credit card with Navy Federal CU for 10 months. As of March, I got a new job which has effectively doubled+ my income. In addition to all of the traditional planning (setting up a Roth/IRA, paying off debts, etc) I've decided that I want to move on to a non-secured credit card.  My only remaining debt is a small (&lt;$8,000USD) auto loan which will be paid off by 2016Q1.  I ran my free credit report based on my limited history, and my score is currently right about 680-700.

1. Should I stick with my CU, or go for a bigger name? (Chase Sapphire Preferred comes to mind because of their high reviews and good rewards program)  
2. Based on your limited knowledge of my history, what steps should I take towards getting approved for a higher-end travel card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred? Obviously, I pay my current card in full (or down to 2-3%) every month, and never go outside of my means.

personalfinance,Generating Retirement Cash-Flow Using Covered Calls and Cash-Secured Puts,"Can anyone comment or provide any advise on generating cash-flow using covered calls and cash-secured puts?

I'm in my mid-40s and have been saving for retirement for 20+ years.  I've generally had a goal of reaching about $5 million to be able retire comfortably, assuming that $5 million would generate about $250k/yr at 5% interest and I would never have to touch the principal.  With interest rates continuing to be at historic lows, I've re-adjusted my thinking.

I've been trading covered calls and cash-secured puts in my Roth IRA account, essentially creating tax-free cash in that account, and building up its balance.  Conservatively, I've been generating about a half-percent per week (0.005) selling calls and puts against QQQs and some individual stocks like FB, AAPL, and SBUX.  At $100,000 balance, I've been able to generate about $500 per week ($100,000 x 0.005 = $500).  Some weeks are better, other weeks I miss out completely.  But I still average 0.5% per week.

Now I'm considering using my regular (taxable) brokerage account to do the same thing.  This account has about $800k in various stocks and ETFs.  At 0.5% per week, that would generate about $4000 every week.  That got me thinking...  With some quick math, we're talking a decent amount of cash coming in.  $4000 weekly = $208,000 annually!  Shit, I can live off of that!  All of a sudden, I'm thinking about retirement, now, in my mid-40s.

I understand we're in a bull market.  I understand there will be ups and downs.  I also understand that we're probably towards the end of the current bull market.

Is this sustainable?  Is my thinking correct?  Am I missing something glaringly obvious?  Does anyone do this currently as a primary source of income?  Any advise/guidance/experiences would be appreciated.",finance,1435097689

personalfinance,How To Do Research on An Advisor,"""There's a sucker born every minute"" - probably someone wanting to get rich quick.  And while a sucker continues to be born every single minute, there will be someone posing as an ""adviser"" waiting to slowly drain you of your cash.  After yet another front page post of someone being sweet-talked into ridiculously loaded funds and unnecessary insurance products, I've decided to create a post to let people know how to research an adviser.  

If you are currently with an adviser and concerned that something is amiss, or you are currently in talks with an adviser and unsure you should let them handle your money you will need these two websites:

* [FINRA's BrokerCheck](http://brokercheck.finra.org/)
* [SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure Investment Adviser Search](http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/Search/iapd_Search.aspx)

FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) is not a government regulatory agency, but rather a non-profit [self-regulatory organization](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sro.asp) dedicated to promoting the safety of investors.  How they do this is through requiring anyone who wants to give investment advice or sell securities to pass exams that demonstrate knowledge.  Two of the more prominent of these exams are the Series 7 and the Series 65.  The Series 7 exam allows one to trade securities and the Series 65 allows one act as an investment adviser and give advice to clients.

Now, why this is important in the RIA space is because it determines how your adviser is allowed to act.  

The SEC is the government body in charge regulating the securities industry, and more importantly, those who work in the industry.  From their website, this is what the IAPD does: 

&gt;The Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) database provides instant access to registration documents filed by more than 25,000 SEC- or state-registered investment advisers. IAPD provides access to Form ADV filings made by investment adviser firms that register electronically using the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD). IAPD also provides access to registration information filed with the states by investment adviser representatives (certain individuals that are employed by an investment adviser).

Which means that legally, anyone holding themselves in the public as a registered investment adviser must file a public disclosure.  There are exemptions to when someone must register as a registered investment adviser, however, those exemptions are very specific.

The most important thing of note on the IAPD is the firm form [ADV](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/advform.asp).  The ADV is split into two parts.

Part 1A of the ADV lists the following:

* General business contact information and principal office (certain firms may have grown and can afford multiple offices) (Item 1)

* How the firm classifies itself (large advisory firm, small advisory firm, pension consultant, advisory with main office outside of the US (Item 2)

* Individual states the firm is authorized to trade or sell securities in (Item 2)

* How many employees the firm has and how many are allowed to give investment advice, licensed to sell insurance, or registered with a state to sell securities (Item 5)

* How the advisers are compensated (Item 5)

* What type of services the firm provides (Item 5)

* If the firm is involved with other business activities and if the firm sells products (If yes, go to Section 6.3B of Schedule D) (Item 6)

* If the firm is has any potential professional/financial industry conflicts of interest (Item 7)

* If the firm has any client conflict of interest (Item 8)

* If the firm or any affiliate has been convicted of a felony, misdemeanor, been in trouble with the SEC or Commodity Futures Trading Commission, any other federal or state regulatory agency, any self-regulatory organization (such as FINRA, or even the New York Stock Exchange), or if the firm/any affiliate has been in trouble for investment-related activity. (Item 11)

Part 2 of the ADV is the ""Firm Brochure"".  Every single firm is required to hand this out and I highly recommend you ask your advisor for theirs.  The brochure will list how the firm charges for compensation, the types of clients they do business with, and the code of ethics of the firm.

Schedule A lists the owners of the firm
Schedule B lists any indirect owners
Schedule D (yes, D, not C) is the general ""extra info"" schedule.  Usually, if an adviser has checked some box ""yes"" where you think it should have been checked ""no"" there will probably be an explanation in Schedule D.  For example, if you see that a firm checks yes in the section asking if they ""sell products or provide other services"", Schedule D may state that the firm offers a fee for tax preparation.

Now, with all of that said, let's go into IAPD and BrokerCheck to search for a firm in my hometown.

[On the IAPD search page](http://imgur.com/dZ4lV8H) you can search by individual or by firm.  However, if you have nothing in mind, you can just do a general search in an area code, like I am doing.  Once you hit search, you'll be presented with a list of every firm in that radius who registers as an investment adviser or brokerage with the SEC or the state it resides in.  [At the bottom you can see there were 53 hits for a 5 miles radius in the 23320 area code](http://imgur.com/WycfFnx).  I'm going to focus on Lincoln Financial Advisors Corporation.  This firm offers brokerage services as well as investment advice.  Both of the blue links are clickable and in fact, clicking on the brokerage link will take you to FINRA's BrokerCheck website, since that is the organization in charge of regulating brokers.  For now, we'll click on Investment Adviser Firm.  That will bring you [here](http://imgur.com/e5AM4fy).  The first thing that should stand out is if this firm is registered with the SEC or not.  If it is not registered with the SEC, then that isn't immediately a cause for concern.  If a firm manages less that $100 million and is housed in a state that doesn't require registration, then the firm is not required to register with the SEC.

Click on the blue SEC and then you'll be into the form ADV.  Scroll down a bit and on the left you'll see all the [items, brochure, and schedule links](http://imgur.com/hyjZ4by).  From here you can explore anything.  

* From Item 1 I can see that the principle office is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and not Chesapeake, Virginia.  

* In Item 5 I see that the company employs 1480 people, so it looks like I'm dealing with a large company, and not a small local shop. I can also see that the firm charges compensation by percentage of assets under management, hourly charges, fixed fees, and commissions.  They are involved with numerous activities, so it's possible they do tax filing services or sell insurance.  Right below I can see that it provides educational seminars for a fee.

 * In Item 6 I can see that it is also involved in the broker-dealer business and insurance business

* In item 8 I can see that the firm checked yes to
&gt; do you or any other related person recommend purchase or sale of securities to advisory clients for which you or any related person has any other sales interest (other than the receipt of sales commissions as a broker or registered representative of a broker-dealer)?

and

&gt; do you or any other related person recommend purchase of securities to advisory clients for which you or any related person serves as underwriter, general or managing partner, or purchaser representative?

Which means that they recommend securities that someone related to their practice has a vested interest in and that they recommend securities that have their own vested interest in.


[Here's a real fun page from their Item 11](http://imgur.com/a/QNYlg).

Let's go into BrokerCheck to see how or what their regulatory offenses.  [BrokerCheck has a similar working search feature](http://imgur.com/HNK3xqU).  So I'm going to go search 23320 for the firm.   After searching the firm and scrolling down a little, you'll see [this](http://imgur.com/DpAeqpB).  This shows you what the firm again registers as, what those terms mean, the main office, and if it has disclosures (which we already knew about from the IAPD).  We can click on ""detailed report"" and have a report created for us.  This report will tell us

* the extent of the firm's disclosures

* if it is currently suspended with any regulators

* who it registers under

* The details of any allegation the firm has been through [for example](http://imgur.com/ScCHbq8)


The details of everything I just went through can also be done with an individual!


From all of this, I personally wouldn't invest with Lincoln Financial Advisors, mainly because I enjoy the feel of a smaller office and a company that was started in the area I live.  Also, I don't live in my hometown and I work in the industry.

Hopefully this was of some help to you.  One day I'll go back and make everything a little easier to read and more concise.",finance,1435102906

Do I pay off the one generating $2,500 interest a year but only generating 5% interest, or the one generating $1,000 interest that has a 10% rate?

So before I graduated, I committed to a school that I always wanted to attend. Its right next to DC, far enough from home, and the campus is big, diverse, and lively; completely perfect to me. To cut to the chase, I just now realized how much of a hassle it'd be to attend. 

Here is my freshman year 2015-2016 financial aid package:

**Federal Pell Grant:** $626

- My father apparently makes too much and my EFC is too high for me to get a higher pell grant. Mother is unemployed.

**VA Guaranteed Asst Prog Grant:** $4,500

**Federal Direct Subsidized Loan:** $3,500

**Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan:** $2,000 
 
**Remaining Cost:** *$16,498*

- But honestly some of that is estimated fees, books, supplies, etc 

My dumbass didn't apply to a local college I can stay at home for because I wanted to get away from home. It also didn't apply to a CC because I felt as if I worked way too hard in high school to go to a CC (forgive me, I was ignorant a month ago). I can't take out a parent PLUS loan because my parents both have horrible credit and my dad can't co-sign for a private loan for me since he has too much debt (will have to ask another family member). I didn't win any local scholarships, but i'm still applying for ones I can find now.

My plans:

1. To attend the college and go to the Navy right after to help pay for it. I would've done it before but I don't want to miss out on the experience (stupid, I know). However, I don't know how debt and the navy works out. 

2. Take out loans each year I need them since I plan to become an RA (free housing &amp; apparently a stipend) &amp; work my ass off in college and get scholarships. 

3. My dad may be getting $150,000 when my grandma sells her apartment in NYC as his inheritance so he said he could help me out as I do the above. 


4. Either transfer after my first year to a school with a NROTC scholarship program or try to utilize the AROTC program here (although I perfer the Navy).

***However, option 2, 3, &amp; 4 are based on total possibility whether I get in the specific programs or not.*** 

I really wanted to avoid taking out $16,498 in private loans, but I guess that'd be what I have to do. I **REALLY** want to attend the school of my dreams, but i'm afraid that tuition will increase significantly each year and so would my debt. I know I fucked up, but I want to make things work out.

What should I plan of action be?

I hope all is well with everyone. As a long time lurker, I have what I believe is a somewhat funny story.

So about 2 weeks before E3 my bro and I were talking about cool characters to add to smash bros. I had mentioned Ryu and it would be cool if you could incorporate Street Fighter controls to Super Smash Wii U. 

Fast forward and Ryu ended up being added to Smash. When my brother came over my house the next day I showed him Ryu in the Roster and I told him nintendo stole my idea after I e-mailed the VP lol. 

Some background info, my brother is very intelligent, but very gullible. I'm not sure if anyone has seen Tim and Eric's ""Poop Tube"" video(if not here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFzTm6fy_zs) but I told my bro it was real last year not thinking he would believe it, and he did lol. 

So back on topic, my brother ended up telling his friends and now his friends want to go protest against Nintendo. Not only that but my brother came with a speech to post as his 1st youtube video and said we should setup a donation page. 

We ended up having a get together with our family this Sunday and everyone was egging him on so he asked me if we could shoot the video Tuesday(today). 

Anyway after shopping for a dress shirt for him, and Fedora, we have a video he created. I still haven't told him the whole thing was a joke but he believes he is taking a stand against nintendo lol. Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKAUHtKXYAk

personalfinance,"22M, been in the US for ~1y, still can't get my credit report or verify my identity","I relocated to the US (NY area) 13 months ago. In the process of doing so, I got myself new bank accounts, a (secured) credit card, got to pay up a nice premium in rent and security deposit because I had no US credit history.

More than a year has passed since then. I have moved on to a non-secured credit card, applied for a few more.

Problem: I seem to not exist, at least according to the following sources:

* CreditKarma
* Mint.com's credit report
* AnnualCreditReport.com
* UPS My Choice/Fedex Delivery Manager
* USPS's mail forwarding Identity Check
* IRS.gov's online account system
* All online application forms for CCs. They always end up saying something similar to ""We cannot look up your personal information. Please apply by phone/mail"". Applying by phone/mail does work.
* Pretty much anything that involves verifying my identity.

I've repeatedly called the support hotline for these entities, but all I get are the same vague answers: These things require being ""in public records"", that ""these records take time before people show up in them"", and that I ""don't need to do anything, I'll end up there eventually over time"".

Well, it still hasn't happened. This is starting to be worrying because I want to move to some other rental soon, and this time I want to be able to show my credit report so that I am taken seriously by the landlord and get better rates.
The best I have so far is my Discover CC statement, which gives me my TransUnion score every month. That's better than nothing, but it's not something I can use to show to my future landlord.

What should I do?

Possibly-relevant information:

* I have an SSN that starts with one of those unregistered-to-a-particular-state numbers (8xx).
* I do not have a driving license or have ever been to the DMV. I hear it's one way of getting onto the ""public records"", but I would need to learn how to drive first.",finance,1435122816

personalfinance,Should I take out a subsidized student loan when I don't need one?,"Alright PF, 
I'm a college student who will be beginning their senior year at a state college studying Accounting and Finance. I have an EFC of $0 because I am considered independent due to my military status in the Air National Guard. As such I will qualify for grants on top of my military aid and scholarships which means that my tuition and books will be paid for. At the same time I will be eligible to take out a subsidized loan of max $5,500 (I think). 
If I have read everything correctly the loan accrues no interest until 6 months after I graduate. There is a 1.05% loan fee. After the grace period the interest rate is like 4.5% or something.
I also am currently in a summer internship with a US agency that has a relatively high likelihood of a job offer when I graduate. If I were to enter into a job with them after I graduate I would be eligible for their student loan repayment program after 6 months of working there and they repay up to 10K if I sign a 3 year contract. Their entry level salary is around 60K pre tax.
I have about 20K split up between a personal investing account (18K) and a TSP/RothTSP (2K).

Current Pros
* The way I look at it that $5,500 loan will be the cheapest rate I'll ever get. I can invest it in the market and make 
* a nice chunk of change.
* If I choose to go to that job I can uses their SLRP to pay the loan and I get a free bonus.
* Taking then paying off that loan (might?) boost my credit score?

Current Cons
* I don't like debt.
* If I invest and the market tanks I could loose money and still end up owing.
* A year and a half is a relatively short investment horizon.
* I may not go with the agency job if I find something else I like taking the SLRP program out of the picture.
* SLRP program at agency could get cut out of their budget (not too likely).",finance,1435124035

Credit card had about $700 in debt on an $1400 credit available non-secure credit card. I have bad credit history from the past, so ofcourse a not so great interest rate. But I have credit. 

I left my country (USA) to Taiwan... I called my credit card company from Taiwan after closing my bank accounts in the USA. 

""Hi, I would like to do a bank transfer to pay off my credit card."" **I am informed that is not possible! **

""So how am I suppose to pay my credit card? I thought you were a bank?""
"" No, we dont accept bank transfers."" 
 - my choices were  send a moneyorder, or have someone in the USA send in a payment."" 

The moneyorder I would not be able to do since I am in foreign country, and barely speak the language and the forms are in mandarin. A bank account here doesnt give you a checking account... they are non existant, its essentially a safe place to hold my money instead of under the bed. 

She says ""How about Western Union?"" and at that time, 3 years ago... there was no Western Union service available in Taiwan. 

On the second suggestion ask a family member to do this for you:

Now granted I probably could do this.. but why should I burden someone else with my money problems? This is a personal matter. What if for example I was the last living person of my family with no trustworthy friends? Than what do I do in this situation? Which is what I told them.. I am living in a foreign country now, with no contacts back home. 
 
Regardless... I am compounding interest on this balance, the credit card has been canceled by the company for non-payment.

Should I just wait it out another few years and this will get erased from credit history? 

I am still living outside the country where the debt is. The kicker is that I have the money to pay the debt... but I do not want to pay any of the interest. Can I negotiate terms? I am pretty sure they sent it off to a collection agency.. who has no method of contacting me: no cellphone, no address at home. Last address was a PO box, etc. 
Amazingly, I have another credit card in perfect payment history.
I also plan on applying for a credit card in this country as I am now considered a citizen via marriage.

financialindependence,What is required for $100k/yr interest?,"Serious question: What is required for the following?

1) Make $100k a year in interest, in monthly payouts of ~$8.3k.

2) Principle continues to grow to keep up with (1) inflation rate (~3.22% on average? or round up to 4% to allow for more growth &amp; for intermittent inflation hiccups on an annual basis), and (2) monthly withdrawls.  So basically, it's self-sustaining.  This includes growing the $100k/yr at annual inflation rates.  For example, doing some quick numbers on an inflation calculator, $100k in 1985 is equal to $221k in today's money:

http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/

3) Can be managed with minimal intervention (using something more on the automated side, like Betterment), i.e. I don't have to become a rocket scientist in investing or a rock star at it (which would, of course, require a larger principle investment to make it grow as required since the growth rate would be less than if I were doing heavily active investing), and no financial manager required.

I'd imagine the tax rate varies, but what's a safe number to put on the withdrawls - 30%?  So if the annual take-home from interest is $100k, actual after local state/Federal government tax cuts is $70k?

I am (1) not the best at math presently, and (2) inexperienced in any sort of investing, but am willing to read &amp; learn.  I am disciplined when it comes to saving &amp; can follow a plan.  Right now this is all just blue-skying &amp; I'd imagine you'd need a principle nut of of something ridiculously high like $10 million, but I'm curious as to what would actually be required to make it happen.  So what sort of account would allow for monthly automatic withdrawls?  Obviously things like 401k's &amp; IRA's are locked out until retirement, so those are out.

edit up top: My math is wrong. I mistook savings over 30 years for instantaneous savings, which makes 4.5% interest savings look like 200% ""instantaneous"" savings, which, of course, is crazy (and incorrect). Thanks for the schooling!

------------------------------------

Hello r/investing,

I did a little digging and found these two posts about paying off mortgages early instead of investing: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h8t37/pay_more_towards_mortgage_vs_investing/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2bvcch/what_does_rinvesting_think_of_paying_off_your/).

At first, the advice makes sense:

&gt; Do you believe that over the next 30 years that the annualized return of the stock market will be greater than [4.5]%? 

&gt; If your house was paid off, would you borrow 40k of equity out of it at [4.5]% to invest?

**The highest upvoted advice seems to be: If you have a mortgage at 4.5% interest rate, it's better to invest if you think you'll have a 4.5% or more ROI.**

Now, I realize that mortgages can be structured differently and come with all sorts of fine print, so let me tell you the specifics of my mortgage:

- 360 month (30 year)  $150K mortgage at 4.5% fixed interest 

- 3% down payment (first-time home buyer program)

- No pre-payment penalty

- It's a condo that's worth about $200K; more than the mortgage, less than the mortgage + all interest

- The condo makes great rent (&gt; 1.33% of the mortgage per month before taxes)

- If you need other details, I'd be happy to oblige

The thing people don't realize about [at least some] mortgages is that even though the interest is low (4.5%!), the interest payments are front-loaded. Here is an approximation of my amortization for my first 10 payments (I'm excluding escrow to keep things simple):

Principal ($)|Interest ($)|Total ($)
:-:|:-:|:-:
230|520|750
232|518|750
234|516|750
236|514|750
238|512|750
240|510|750
242|508|750
244|506|750
246|504|750
248|502|750

*Based on how I understand mortgages*, it becomes immediately obvious that, in the beginning of my mortgage, for every ~$250 I pay ahead, I save ~$500 in interest; any forward payment I make goes directly toward principal and the interest is eliminated on that payment of the loan. **If true, this is basically a 200% ROI, correct?**

To be clear, let's say I have $250 extra to invest this month (that is, I already made my minimum mortgage payment). If I spend it on my mortgage, I'm guaranteed to save myself $500 in interest. If I instead invest it, I pay the $500 in interest on my mortgage, so I must make more than $500 on that $250 to make it worth it, no?

So, r/investing, why would I invest in the market instead of paying off my mortgage, at least to a point where I'm *actually* being charged less money per payment than I feel I could make in the market? That is, when my mortgage payments are roughly 90% principal?

Thanks in advance!

---------------------------

**edit:** I agree there's an error in my logic somewhere. I'm starting to understand that the ~$500 saved is over the 30 years, not immediately. That's still a 200% ROI that I *can* net over 30 years, or sooner if I choose to do so... no?

**edit 2:** I think /u/whodun answered my question:

- I would be saving 4.5% over 30 years on the $250, which works out to the ~$500 saved. The 200% would be if I saw all of those savings instantly, but I don't; I see 4.5% savings compound over the life of the mortgage.

- The math isn't 1:1 between stocks and real estate, because interest on real estate can be tax write-offs while profits from stocks are taxed 15% (this is good to know for future investments!)

- The amortization table shows the interest paid per payment of principal over the course of the life of the loan; that's why the interest is going down month by month. I did not understand that when making this post.

- By paying my mortgage early, I save the interest (4.5%), compounded for the life of the mortgage. Paying extra *early* is still better, but not the crazy return I was calculating; it's just more time to compound.

**So, ultimately, the posts I linked to are correct once you adjust for pre-tax vs. post-tax dollars; if your stock portfolio will return more than the interest on your mortgage costs you over the same period of time, it is the better investment.**

personalfinance,flair:Debt Interest rates Vs. Exchange rates: What is the best way to pay student loans while abroad?,"Hey all, thanks for any advice in advanced. I live and work abroad in Japan. In the last two years, the exchange rate from JYN to USD has gotten continually worse. It now hovers around 123-125 JYP per 1 USD. As my income is only in JYN, I find it quite defeating when I have to exchange money to USD in order to pay for student loans in the U.S.
 

My question is, would it be better to only pay the minimum payment on my loans while saving my JYN in Japan and waiting for a better exchange rate, or should I continue to pay down my loans as much as possible regardless of the poor exchange rate?
 

Additional information:

I budget 120000 JYN a month for student loans.
I must pay at least 500 USD a month for minimum payments.
A rough list of my loans and the order I try to pay them down:

8,500 @ 7.25%

personalfinance,Help me work through my strategy for buying a house.,"Wife and I are thinking about buying a house in the next 4-12 months. What is the best way to approach buying with respect to interest rates, a rising local market, and limited funds?

We will be able to buy within the year, but only with 5-10% down on a house anywhere from 150k-240k. The higher the price, the lower the DP. Due to a cool local market that's warming up, huge population growth projections in the area over the next 10-15 years, and historically low interest rates, I think the PMI on a sub-20% down loan could be worth it.  My wife and I would plan to stay in the house for at least 5-10 years min, if not longer. I also am looking forward to home ownership.

I'm having trouble deciding on what is the appropriate price range for us. We could make the payments on a $240k house, at an estimated $1450/mo, but that feels so high compared to our current rent for a decent small house at right at $1000/mo, or equivalent mortgage on a 150k house. We would not be saving much beyond my 401k until our income goes up. Even so, the NYT buy vs rent [calculator](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0) still says it could be better to buy if we stay for only 6 years.

My wife and I (22 &amp; 25 respectively) just received $15k and we wanted to pick your brains to see what we should do with it.

A little background: 
Combined, we have credit card debt of ~$15,000 @ ~15% interest. Myself just under $6,000 and her ~$9,000. 
She's going through a Master's program and has student loans of ~$50,000 (not sure of her interest rates). I'm hovering at $5,000 (only $3,000 of it has interest of 7%).

We both have good, steady jobs where we are happy with a combined income of ~$80,000. Cost of living is around $3,200/month where we live. (I'm including car payments, utility billing, rent, groceries, eating out, costs for animals).

In our 5 year plan, we'd like to purchase property and build a 2 story barn with an apartment upstairs where we can keep our 2 horses and live. We'll rent out the other 2-4 stables to horse owners for $250/month each. 

In our 10 year plan, we see 2 kids (maybe 3 because accidents happen), a house on that same property and renting out the barn apartment or keeping it as a guest home.

We've considered the following:
Put it all in savings and let interest accrue - eventually use it for a property/barn-apartment down payment.
Use it to pay off credit cards over time so our credit gets a nice boost.

We're both interested in hearing what else your experience would suggest.

Thank you in advance for reading this post.

I've paid over $40,000 toward my student loans (principal and interest) since I've graduated (3 years). The initial borrowing TOTAL for tuition from WF was $83,000. I am now at a principal balance of $74,149, which means according to them I've only paid $8,851 towards all of my principal. This means that so far roughly only $.22 of every $1 is going toward paying off my debt ~~and that the interest percent is closer to 452% (meaning for every $1 I pay them toward my principal debt they charge me $4.52 in interest). **I know that's not how interest rates work and it's a huge oversimplification but I'm just giving some context on how goddamn ridiculous that is.~~

I just added up one of my statements that is just toward 1 loan (1 of 7) and it says under ""payments made towards principal"" (excluding all interest) that over the last 3 years I've put $11,689 towards PRINCIPAL on this one account. The entirety of that single loan is $22,000. If I had put that much towards principal, then the principal balance today would be $10,311. It is not. It is in fact $18,318. Just FYI this single loan has a fixed APR of 8.24%. Something isn't adding up, I don't understand where these numbers are coming from and I feel I should be a lot further along in paying off these loans by now. Thanks in advance.

I have opened a Vanguard IRA for him to facilitate this cashed-out pension.  I'm going back and forth on what to do with it.  Here are my ideas, I'm welcome to hear others:

1.  Vanguard Target Retirement 2015 Fund (50/50 split across stocks and bonds)
2. Vanguard Target Retirement 2020 Fund (60/40 split across stocks and bonds)
3.  Some type of ""lazy"" portfolio, like (33/33/33 Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund)'
4.  An more aggressive portfolio with no bonds, like a Dave Ramsey type profile of (25/25/25/25 Growth, Growth &amp; Income, Mid-Cap and International).

My problem is that I hate bonds.  Knowing that interest rates are going to go up and the bonds are going to go down puts doubt in my mind that I should put any money in bonds.

I do not have a lot of details on my expenditures because my parents still pay for most of it until I move out in August. I am 22 years old and male.

Income:

 * $64,000 as Software Developer starting in August
 * $4,000+ bonus at end of year
 * $2,000+$1,000 signing and relocation bonus
 * $6,300 in savings (1% I think) + checking accounts

Expected Monthly Expenses:

 * $700 rent, includes utilities, internet, tv, etc.
 * $200 food
 * ~$100 eating out
 * $60 Cell Phone
 * $60? gas, live close to work, so it shouldn't be much
 * no idea about anything else, including insurance, health, gym, etc.

Debts:

 * Perkins Loan $6,600 5.000%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $3,500.00 3.400%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $4,500.00 3.400%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $4,500.00 3.860%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $5,298.41 4.660%
 * Grace period ends in November this year
 * I have $50 autopay for Stafford on 10th of each month just for the summer

Other:

 * I have a car that is worth ~$18k. Parents are planning on giving payment responsibility to me, so I'm thinking of trading for a far cheaper car
 * I have no idea how much of the car is paid off
 * Employer offers 4% 401k match graduated, fully vested after 5 years.
 * Personal retirement account as well, which I don't really understand
 * Otherwise decent employment benefits
 * Current girlfriend and I are considering moving in together once she graduates and gets employed so I can pay off loans instead of rent. She has absolutely no debt, $7k in savings, summer internship, but moving out to low rent apartment soon.
 * Long term, I'm definitely thinking of marriage and getting a home, so I am thinking getting rid of debt soon is key, right?

With about $4k post tax monthly income, I was thinking anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 monthly loan payments, which should get me out of debt in a year and a half (ignoring car). Is this the right way to go about it? I know it is best to put money towards highest interest rates, so Perkins will be first. Is it better to pay off Perkins completely and minimum on Stafford? Would it be better to pay less in total and put difference toward retirement? 

My benefits package for the 401k says ""The Company provides a contribution to match your eligible before-tax and/or after-tax contributions of up to 4% of eligible pay."" Does that mean they give me 4% of 18,000 or 64,000?

Also, can someone explain the point of an emergency fund when I just got hired? I don't see the point when I am in a 20 week training program at my employer's brand new location with over 1000 new hires. I just don't really see myself needing it until after at least a year.

technology,Dear Samsung,"I’ve never written a letter to an entity before, so please be patient and please don’t make it weird. 

I’m a volunteer with the U.S. Peace Corps, and I have something I need to tell you: thank you for everything your people did to make the Samsung Series 9 a thing.  Let me explain. If you’re not intimately familiar with the Peace Corps, don’t feel left out; even Americans aren’t sure what we do or why we do it.  

The U.S. Peace Corps selects Americans to live abroad for 2 years with the objective of providing skilled labor to host countries which request it, spreading American culture to diverse areas, and to share new cultures back home in the United States.  

For the last 20 months, I’ve been living in Zambia, a country roughly the size of Texas, with 14.4 million people.  The vast majority of people in Zambia (over 75%) live in rural areas, and my home has been characteristically rural, nearly 25 kilometers from paved roads and established infrastructure.  

I live in a forgotten place. 

Throughout my time in Zambia, the Samsung Series 9 has not only been dependable and sturdy, it has been, for many in my community, a portal to the future. Every Monday I meet with a classroom of 30 eager children at Kaunda Primary School where we huddle around my Samsung Series 9 and discuss graphical user interfaces, excel spreadsheets, and word documents.  We argue over fonts, file management, and operating systems.  We talk about central processing units, RAM, and peripherals.   

Outside of the Series 9, these children have never seen a computer before and, for many, may be the only computer they ever touch.  It’s the absolute ultimate in modern computing, and Samsung has made it possible.  Even these children comment on its being thin, portable, energy-efficient, fast, and quiet.  The super-bright screen, although pockmarked with sand and grit, is readily viewed in full sunlight, a necessity in rural sub-Saharan Africa.  The children frequently comment on the lightness and usability of its keyboard, especially as they’ve been practicing on paper printouts of keyboards for the last 5 weeks. 

In fact, the students don’t know the half of it; the series 9 has been everywhere with me.  It’s traveled to Victoria Falls, Namibia, Botswana, Tanzania, and a detour to Italy to visit my family.  It’s survived an elephant stampede, a honey badger, and a midnight mugging.  It’s also weathered the stresses of everyday travel in rural Zambia – live chickens, rowdy goats, crowded buses, colicky infants, drunk drivers, and impossibly hot and incredibly humid summers.  It’s also survived communal living and downright hostile conditions – crowded power outlets, frequent power outages, cheap plug adapters, uncommon power wattages, wind-driven dust storms, and overstuffed compartments.  It has survived terrific stresses, even while other electronics have been utterly destroyed; over 5 Macbook Airs of other Peace Corps Volunteers have malfunctioned in the time I’ve been here. 3 of which have been returned, delivered in-country, and then malfunctioned again. 

For fear of sounding a bit grandiose, the Samsung Series 9 may be one of the most durable, powerful ultra-books to have ever existed.  

And it continues to provide a terrific user experience for me and over 100 students in rural Zambia.   

What can I say to Samsung and its engineers? 

Thank you.",technology,1435180757

I am getting married this year in October and I know that if we file taxes jointly, they will count his income which will make my payment go up.

I'm not sure of the exact amount but I believe my fiancé and I make about 40k bare minimum though I'm 90% sure it's closer to 45k a year. Or at least in between. 

I was thinking though, maybe we should file separately and keep my student loan payments low. And just pay whatever amount to keep the balance from growing plus whatever more we can afford. 

We really want to save up a down payment and buy a house in 1 to 2 years. And also pay off my car loan which is about 8k. And Fiancé needs a car of his own when his inevitably dies in a couple years.

personalfinance,Series EE Bond questions--which would be the bet to cash from a variety?,"My wife recently had a relative pass away who left her close to 100 EE savings bonds.  She is interested in redeeming a small portion of them to help cover the cost of some much needed household/appliance upgrades.  The oldest ones mature fully in 2021 and currently have a yield over 5% and interest rate of 4%.  The youngest ones mature fully in 2031 with a rate of 1.49% and yield of just under 3%.  The youngest 15 bonds have not yet reached face value, but also have some of the lowest rates and yield from the bunch.

Financially we have no need to cash all of them and would like to let as many mature fully before redeeming them.  If she were to redeem any of these bonds to cover these house purchases would I be correct in the idea that it would be most wise to redeem those with the lowest yields/rates first even if they have not reached face value and save the those with the highest yields/rates?  I would imagine it better to keep the oldest ones simply because they are relatively close to full maturation and they also have the highest % yield of the bunch.  

At the same time what is the likelihood that the youngest bunch that have low yield's now could turn around in the next 15-20 years and reach the point of the current old ones?  Should I cherry pick the bonds from the middle that have reached face value, but also have less than impressive rates?

Lastly a side question...these bonds all have different periods when interest is collected.  If it shows 06/2015 would she need to wait until after the end of the month to cash them or is the interest collected at the beginning of the month?

Any and all help is be appreciated.",finance,1435190533

I have about $35,000 in student loans in my mothers name that are causing her a large amount of stress. I want to move the loans over into my name. The loans are about 8% interest. While I wouldn't mind lowering the interest rate in the process, my primary objective is to take over the loans in my own name.

About me:

* 750 credit score

* 80k salary

* $310,000 house paid down to $285,000 at 4.25%

* 20k student loans in my name

* No savings


What is the best way to transfer this debt into my name without taking a hit on interest rates? I looked into HELOC loans on my house but the bank said I need at 85% LTV. 

Thanks

I've read, and re-read as much as I could from MMM, Early Retirement Extreme, the Bogleheads Wiki, the sidebar here on personal finance, and some other articles across the web.

I want to bring it all together, but I still have some questions that apply to my specific situation. I'm want to thank in advance anyone who responds with advice and also apologize for the long-winded post. 

I figure I'll list off all my pertinent info below in order to paint a picture of my situation, and explain what my goals are and how I plan to accomplish them. I'd like to see if I'm on the right track or way off the mark. I apologize if I get any of the lingo wrong, please feel free to correct me.

Basics: 25, male, college graduate, engaged and getting married next year, no kids and none planned until I'm 30+.

Income:   
$52,000/year before taxes  
$3500/month take-home  
$400/month rent from my fiance's parents during school months while she's still finishing her degree.  

Assets:

Car - Fully owned, valued at $16,000 KBB  
Cash - $25,000  

Credit:  
Credit Card #1: $5,000 limit  
Credit Card #2: $500 limit  
Credit Score: 750+ / Excellent  
HELOC on Condo: $100,000 line of credit, 3.25% APR, none currently utilized  

Debt:  
$40,000 - Student Loans 4% - 6.5% interest rates  

-------------------------------

**Monthly Expenses**:  
Condo Fee - $288 (Water/Garbage/Garage Parking Spots/Cable/Internet/Pools/Gym/Maintenance)  
Car Insurance - $150  
Fuel - $90  
Phone Plan - $95  
Electricity - $90   
Groceries - $200  
Health Insurance - $270  
Personal Care - $20  
Student Loan Payments - $460  

**Yearly Expenses**:  
Home Property Tax: $2850  
Car Property Tax: $300  

-------------------------------

Right now I factor my property tax by dividing last year's expenses by 12 and adding them into my monthly expenses which puts me at around $1925~ total.  

I estimate that I spend another $250 a month on basically everything else: dining out, misc. expenses, entertainment, etc.   

With all of that out of the way, here's my game plan:  

**Emergency Fund**: Right now I consider $9,000 of my $25,000 to be my fund. This is probably a bit too cautious/high, and I may drop it down to $6,000.   

**401(k)**: My 401(k) plan is terrible. My employer contributes $.20 to each of my dollars up to 5%. The portfolio is also riddled with high expense accounts, without any index funds available at all, and the vesting of the company match is graded: 0-1 year-0%; 2 years-20%; 3 years-40%; 4 years-60%; 5 years-80%; 6 years-100%.  

From what I've read, I think most of you will still say that it's worthwhile to at least contribute up to their match. For what it's worth, I have been with the company for 1.5 years right now and am looking to leave as soon as I can find a higher income job.  

**Student Loan Pay-Off**: I feel like I'll be stuck on this one for a while, but I plan to rid myself of these as fast as humanly possible. I am paying off the highest interest loans first and will utilize the remainder of my cash and any leftover monthly income to destroy these.   

I figure, $25,000 - $9,000 (E. Fund) = $16,000. $40,000 - $16,000 = $24,000 left once I spend the rest of my excess cash. Then, it will be about $1000 - $1500 a month towards student loans assuming no major expenses or income increases via raises/new job/etc. My monthly student loan payments will also begin to fall off as I've got loans out to three different institutions. I optimistically hope to have it all paid off by the end of 2016.   

**Maxing out IRA and 401(k)**: Once the student loans are taken care of, I will pour the rest of my money into these until I can afford to max them out.  

**Early Retirement**: I would love to be able to retire by the time I'm 30 or 35. I understand that I need a higher income for that, and I'm actively looking for a better paying job. I have also not factored my fiance into any of this so far, but she should be finishing school debt-free, or very very close to it. Her starting salary out of college should at least match mine, while our joint expenses will hardly increase. I fully understand the importance of first investing into tax-efficient vehicles once I'm debt-free, but I want to follow in the footsteps of someone like MMM without living like a completely stoic monk. Please don't misunderstand this as me saying I want caviar and Ferraris, but I do want to be able to go and enjoy something like a vacation without having to number-crunch every last detail, and I'd like to enjoy traveling and other hobbies while I'm still young. I pulled out that HELOC in order to try to utilize it to invest in something like my own businesses, real estate, or something else. I'm just not sure if it's smart to do so right now, as the returns would need to pretty high to outweigh my debts.  

Do you have any suggestions, corrections to any of my numbers, my roadmap in general, or really any other advice? I sincerely appreciate it, thank you again for reading all of this, and absolutely hope to pay it forward by giving advice to others as soon as I feel that I am educated enough on the topic to be of help to them. I'll also clarify anything if anyone has questions.",finance,1435210808

personalfinance,Americans in Europe with US student debt and an opportunity to buy an apartment,"I really need some financial guidance and don’t know where to post.  

We got married right after my wife finished law school with $130k in student debt.  When she graduated there was literally no one hiring new lawyers— she was part of the “lost generation” of law school graduates (look it up if you’re curious).  In 2011, right as as her job hunt was looking the most hopeless, I got a great job opportunity in Europe, so we moved.  We’ve been here since.  Her federal loans have been on “income based” repayment, so we’ve been paying minimal payments on them while she looked for a job here.  Compounding interest at 8% has probably increased her loans to $160k by now…. I’m afraid to know the real total.   We file American taxes separately so that my income isn’t hit with her debt. 

It took her 3 years to find a job over here, but we’re now both  working, albeit at lower salaries than the equivalent jobs we might have if we were back in the US.  I make about $85k (and could easily make $110k in the US), and her new job pays her about $50k at the moment, but should increase.)  Salaries are lower in Europe, but the benefits are great.  We like being here and are now thinking of being here for at least another 5 years.   We think it might be time to stop renting and buy an apartment.  We can get a mortgage for 103% of the value of an apartment, at 2% interest, with all interest tax deductible as long as we live in it.  Additionally we can do this based on my income alone, with no US credit check, and keep our mortgage payments the same as our rent payments.

So now I’m thinking we should buy a place with my income, and just use her income to start paying down her loan debt.  Is this a reasonable idea, or crazy?  Are we idiots?  We’re both about 40 years old, so when do we start saving for retirement?  What’s the best plan to ditch that debt?  I really feel like I need some expert/professional advice, but I have no idea who to turn to for it.  Maybe someone here has some words of wisdom?  On top of it all, we’re afraid to sync all our extra money into debt repayment because we need to take care of her mom as well… Her mom is 70, still working hard, but has no retirement.  We never know when we’ll need to start paying her mom’s rent or long term care.  We've got about 10k in savings, a European pension plan, and another 50k in a 401k back in the US.

Advice?  What should we do?

[TLDR:  Should we buy an apartment when my wife has $160k in student loan debt?   Renting seems like a waste.  What’s the best way to plan for our future?  Should we even keep living in Europe since it means lower salaries than it would be in the US?  How do we even start getting rid of that much debt while planning for future needs?]

Things are pretty expensive here so we're looking at houses that maybe need a little work. Not necessarily structurally but more cosmetic (e.g., renovate the bathroom, pull up old carpets, upgrade the kitchen, etc.). I'm curious to learn about loans that you can get along with a mortgage that would allow you to get maybe $20-$30 thousand for these upgrades? From research online, I've read that with a Fannie Mae homestyle loan, it's based on the house's appraised value.

Here are my questions

1) If anyone has done this, can you share your experiences?
2) Is the interest rate on this loan similar to your mortgage interest rate?
3) Is this a loan that you can or would apply for while closing on a house or would you generally wait until everything is finalized and then pursue this.

I will be using this money initially to fund my studying over the next 2 years in Germany so I will need to be able to access the money but I intend to get a job part time so I don't completely deplete my savings during the course of my studies.

At the moment (current value) I have shares which if sold would give me around £20k in profit (however I wish to keep these if possible), I also receive dividends from these shares. £8k spread in 3 different easy access cash ISA's and £2k in my current account.  My current ISA's do not give me a good interest rate.  I also have £5k in a pension, but I cannot draw from this until I am 65 (so this is sort of useless to me at the moment).

So I need advice on how best to manage what I have already, keeping in mind that I do need access to the money but only in the constraints of my budget.  I have planned (up until I get a job) to budget 900 euros / month for living.  So I was thinking of having my existing savings put into one account, and then setting up a direct debit of 900 euros each month into my german current account.  This seems to be realistic expenditure each month for where I will be living.

I also have up to £2500 interest free over draft in my current, current account (student account) so I was wondering whether I should overdraw that and put into the savings as well (just so I can earn interest on it, but keep it available in case the bank ever require that I transfer it back quickly).

My main concerns come from whether I am able to keep savings accounts in the UK considering I will now be living in Germany?

science,"Science AMA Series: I’m Ben Sommers, Assistant Professor of Health Policy and Economics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I research the Affordable Care Act and access to care, and I’m here to talk about it. AMA!","Hello, reddit!

I’m Ben Sommers, [Assistant Professor of Health Policy and Economics](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/benjamin-sommers) in the [Department of Health Policy and Management](http://hsph.harvard.edu/health-policy-and-management) at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I’m interested in researching health policy for vulnerable populations, the uninsured, and the health care safety net, and have served as a senior advisor in health policy to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services.  In addition to being a health economist, I’m also a practicing primary care doctor and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Brigham &amp; Women’s Hospital in Boston.

I recently [led a study](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/survey-finds-state-policies-have-critical-impact-on-aca-applications-enrollment) that found the variable approaches states have taken to implementing the [Affordable Care Act (ACA)](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/topic/affordable-care-act) have had major effects on whether low-income adults are aware of the law, whether they have applied and obtained coverage, and whether or not they think the law has helped them. Our research focused on Arkansas, Kentucky, and Texas—states that have taken markedly different approaches to implementing the ACA:

*      Kentucky expanded Medicaid, created a well-functioning state Marketplace, and supported outreach efforts;
*       Arkansas expanded coverage to low-income adults using private insurance instead of Medicaid, and placed legislative limitations on outreach;
*       Texas did not expand Medicaid, and passed restrictions making it hard for organizations and individuals to assist people applying for coverage.

In addition to the impact of state policies, one of the main takeaways of this research is that many low-income adults are still unaware of the health care reform law despite its passage in 2010.

You can read the full study over at Health Affairs: http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/6/1010.full (Note: The study is typically only available to subscribers, but Health Affairs agreed to make the study available for free for this AMA. It will be open from 8:00 a.m. to Noon EDT.)

I’ll be here at 11:00 a.m. EDT to answer your questions about the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and access to care; ask me anything!

EDIT at 11:10 a.m.: Hi everyone - Happy to be here for the AMA today, lots of good questions. But first, hot off the presses - the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 this morning upholding the availability of premium tax credits in states on the Federal Marketplace. I'll let legal scholars parse the opinions, but in policy terms, this means the ACA dodged a very large threat, and basically the status quo remains in effect.

EDIT at 12:45 p.m.: Thanks everyone for the great and wide-ranging questions!  
For those who want to read more on the ACA, the Kaiser Family Foundation has a [detailed summary of the law's features](http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/summary-of-the-affordable-care-act/) and [here's an article I wrote with some colleagues analyzing the law's initial changes in coverage and access in 2014.] (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1406753)

personalfinance,(MD) I have too much money for my own good.,"So in my last year of high school (age 17), I started working as a programmer.

news,Tunnel Grouting- A boon to modern existence,"Grouting has developed greatly in the last decade. It has become an important and meaningful part of underground construction. [**The tunnel grouting**](http://www.alccofine.com/) system is primarily designed for the back grouting of ring segments in tunnels. 
In this typical system of tunnel grouting, the grout pump takes its supply from a rail car, and pumps it through a flowmeter and pressure transmitter to the inline mixer. In this application the process controller measures the grout pressure and adjusts the speed of the pump, using an inverter drive, to maintain a steady pressure to the back of the ring segments. The signal from the grout flowmeter is fed to the process controller which regulates the speed of the additive pump. This controller determines the flow that the additive pump should produce to maintain the correct proportion of additive to grout, and regulates the additive pump speed to achieve it. The main grout pump can be set to keep a pressure or flow, and the additive pump will automatically maintain the correct proportional flow. Improvements of grout material and equipment will enable better quality final product. 
The environmental requirements have also tightened more in recent years and the harmful lowering of the groundwater level is forbidden. Cementations materials are mostly used in rock grouting in tunnels. Due to the high level of the tightness requirements, very fine grained cements are more often used as even a very small fracture apertures must be grouted. A great deal of effort has gone into grouting design and compliance control. It is not enough to just evaluate or measure the leakages of the final tunnel. The deviation and leakage of grouting holes are measured and control holes are drilled into the grouted section. Moreover, the limitations and requirements for grouts should be inspected at the site. While designing, the varying geological features should be taken into account and tunnels must be divided into sections of different grouting classes. It is then possible to start the grouting. 
Rock mass grouting has been an important part of tunnelling. Rocks such as gneisses, mica-schist and greenstones as well as sandstones, shale, limestone and other metamorphosed rocks form a mountain range. In the field of tunnel grouting constant advances are being made in the development of equipment, methods and materials. There has been a major improvement is the implementation of measures relating to health, safety and the environment while using this method of rock grouting. This system keep the rocks intact for a long time, making the tunnel safe and protected for the people. An appropriate solution must be determined to deal with such zones and to prevent the tunnel imposing an adverse situation. Hence, with this technology of grouting, the modern lifestyle has become secured and harmless.",technology,1435235742
personalfinance,Is a Home Equity Line of Credit a good idea?,"A little background....

My cousin and I are best friends.  He came to me about 5 years ago when he was financially strapped.  He had over 50k in credit card debt at the time and he asked me for advice.  He and his wife decided to change their spending habits and made some very big changes in lifestyle.  Today, they only have 18k of credit card debt left.

He and his wife have a great credit score.  They decided to change banks to a credit union and the rep said that they would qualify for a rather large Home Equity Line of Credit.  They applied and got approved for 40k total.

First off, I told him that shouldn't be used frivolously and he insists that he won't.  What he did ask me about was moving the 18k credit card over to it as well as a home equity loan of 16k over as well due to the fact that he will only have .99% APR for 6 months and then it goes up to prime after that which is 3.25%.  

These interest rates are much better than the 12.99% APR he is currently paying on the credit card or the 8.5%APR he has on the Home Equity Loan.

Before I tell him to do it, I thought I would ask the experts here since I have never had a Home Equity Line of Credit.  We pay up front for just about everything.  Seems like a good deal to me, but this whole thing just sounds a little suspect.   There has to be something negative about it, but I just don't know.

Location: Florida   
Gross Income: $105k   
Filing Status: MFJ
   
*Allocation of Current Year Savings*   
Traditional 401k: $18k   
Traditional 403b: $18k   
Traditional IRAs: $11k   
HSA: $6.65k

Misc. Pre-Tax Expenses: $1.2k   
Annual Household Spending: $33k
   
**Estimated Tax Burden: $3.5k** (Standard Deduction, Two Personal Exemptions)   
   
Since we live in a city free from state income tax, our total effective tax rate will be 3.33%, +/- a few bps.   
   
Due to the fact that we may retire in a different state, I feel like we should take advantage of Roth accounts while the gettin's good.  Between our 401k and IRAs, we could slip close to $12k into post-tax accounts before year end.  Doing so would raise our tax bill from $3.5k to **$5.25k**.   
   
While this would be a minor increase in the effective rate, the $12k in question would be hit with a 15% marginal tax.  For this reason it doesn't seem like a great option.   
   
I plan to use a Roth conversion ladder in retirement.  However, taxes may be incurred during some withdrawals so I want to make sure I take them into account on the front-end.  The marginal rate for these withdrawals would probably be 10% or 15% federal plus state income tax.
   
If you were in my shoes, would you use some of the available Roth space?  The only benefit I see is the absence of state tax at the moment.  Our marginal rate today could very well equal our marginal rate in the future, or be within 5%, so federal could be a wash.   
   
My reason for looking into funding these accounts is for tax diversification and their ability to be accessed before retirement age.  They certainly have their place, and I've used them before.

personalfinance,Should I get this car? Talk me in or out of it.,"Background: I am a 17-year old guy, under some lucky conditions. I live at home, *very* little expenses. I pay for my gas, and books for college. Can't emphasize how lucky and thankful I am for such loving parents. Right now I'm in a program that's letting me be at college for free (excluding books) until fall 2016, at which point I'll start paying about 7500 a year. In other words, I am one of the luckiest kids around for the next year and change.

So I am looking at [this](http://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/638894034/overview/) car and I need some sane people to talk to me. 
I have talked to my family...my mom says do it, my dad says save it or get a similar car to what you have(but he is  very frugal), and my brother and sister both say follow your gut. I need some other thoughts and opinions.

I have $2500 saved right now. I am starting a new job that will get me about 12 grand (after taxes) by January (as compared to my min wage job at Chic Fil A...). 

So I will need to take a **loan, approximately 17 grand,** to make sure I have cash behind me in case something stupid happens. 

Costs for the car: I will need to get all-season tires for it (approx. $650 to get and install). It takes premium gas, and has a bigger tank than my Civic (which I don't really like). Approximately $50 extra a month in gas (ish). I understand most of the expenses I will be undertaking.

Expenses in total if I get the car (as far as I can see): 

16 grand for the car
$650ish for tires
$50 extra a month for gas x 10 months = $500 (not included in loan)

I think I would be able to pay about $250-300 a month and still keep my emergency fund (which I will use for books, as mine haven't been super expensive yet).

Talk me in or out of it. I am blinding myself because I want it so badly.

And if I were to get a loan...

My parents will help me out with acquiring it, but not with paying it. They're just a safeguard. **I'm paying for everything on my own.**

Some base knowledge will be helpful. What kind of payment plan would be good to look into? As in, how much should I am to pay a month, and what is a good balance of interest rate and time? I did read the ""15-20 year olds read this"" and I realize this falls under ""don't buy cars you can't afford."" 

I guess I just might not understand the meaning of ""afford."" 

I can afford to get a loan and slowly pay it back, but I don't have 16 grand, and I won't have it in a year. 

I just really want that car...

personalfinance,"20 year old suddenly making $10,000 a month and no idea what to do","Hi all,

I know this is something that comes up often, and I've extensively read the FAQ as well as lurked in this subreddit for a while. However, I have a couple of special circumstances that I can't find any help with.

First of all, my interest rates on my accounts are outstanding (from my limited knowledge, at least). My sister is a flight attendant with American Airlines, so I'm eligible to bank with the AA Credit Union. For checking accounts with 0.01-5,000 dollars they give you 2.25% APY. $5,001+ and it goes to 0.25% APY, so I'm definitely planning on keeping less then 5,000 in my checking. On my savings account, there's 0.50% APY with no limits, as far as I can tell. So, I'm planning on keeping lots of money in there.

Second, I'm self-employed, so there's no 401k or IRA matching. And before you ask, I make my money self-publishing YA novels. So there's a bit of a risk in that my income can fluctuate. It can go way up (some people I know make 50k a month consistently), but it can also go way down.

Third, I'm going to be moving to Los Angeles in September. Yeah yeah, I know, it's an expensive place to live. However, I'm moving in with my sister and her husband and we're splitting rent, bills, all that stuff.

So what should I do with all this money? I really want to look into investing it, but not sure where to start or if that's even a good idea. Should I just sit on it, keeping my savings account full? Is it worth investing in a 401k AND an IRA if there's no employer matching benefits? If not, which one should I invest in? 

The only thing I know for sure that I should do is get that emergency fund built up.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I appreciate any responses. 

***ETA:*** I plan on getting in touch with a financial adviser once I move to LA. Just want to get a good idea on what to do before then.",finance,1435247031

Banking,PNC Bank has the worst customer service,"Earlier this year I took a $3,000 loan from myself, taking out almost all the money from an old PNC Bank account I had. There are no PNC Banks where I currently work, so why didn't I close it down? I expect to move back East eventually so it would be wise to keep this particular account (Virtual Wallet) with its robust interest rate, which I got as a student and during an introductory period where these accounts offered special rates.

However, I knew I would get charged owning a checking account that was under reserve, so I asked it be downgraded to a lesser account with a smaller reserve. I was permitted to upgrade back to my previous account (same rates) at any time. I was told I only needed a $400 reserve across the accounts to not get charged.

Sure enough, one month later I get the statement and there's a $15 charge. WTF I made sure to double check this wouldn't happen, why?

I call and the rep I talked to earlier didn't downgrade my account. Oops, too bad for you (the customer)! They waived the charge, but by this time I had enough money to meet the reserve on the old account limits, so I figured rather than insist on a downgrade I keep my higher interest rates. I put in $1,600 on May 15 so over the billing period from April 26-May 26 so I should be good, right?

&gt;PNC: Would you like for me to downgrade you to the basic Virtual Wallet? The Virtual Wallet has a monthly service fee of $7. This fee can be waived if you meet at least one of the following requirements:$500.00 combined monthly balance in your Spend and Reserve account OR Use only ATM, online banking or other self-service electronic methods to make withdrawals or deposits; OR Proof of active enrollment in a qualifying educational institution(expires 6 years after the account is enrolled in the PNC Student Banking program).

&gt;Me: No, because I just transferred in $1600 to meet the $2000 minimum. BUT, I want to know if I will be charged a service fee based on that.

&gt;Me: Since I won't have $2000 each day for the month of May/April.

&gt;PNC: Please know that your feedback is very valuable to us and we are always working to improve the service that we provide. I have filed an official complaint for you with the reference number of ------------.

&gt;Me: What complaint?

&gt;PNC: The complaint is about the service fees regarding the Virtual Wallet Performance account.

&gt;Me: There's no need. [the other rep] managed to refund the fee to me, so that's not a problem.

&gt;Me: Rather, you haven't answered the one question I have.

&gt;PNC: I'm sorry! What question did I not answer?

&gt;**Me: I want to know if I will be charged a fee because I didn't have $2000 in the account for the month of May.**

&gt;Me: It will be $2000 min balance on May 15, it seems.

&gt;PNC: Your account must have a balance or direct deposit of $2000 before the end of your statement cycle. Which ends of the 27th of May.

Average monthly balance, after some research, is the sum of your total account value (between spend, reserve, and growth) over the thirty days, divided by 30. So having a balance of exactly $2000 for half a month isn't going to cut it. But I was grilling this guy, over and over, looking for that answer, and he'd just spit out canned statements without any thought applied to my particular case. He was no more helpful than a teller machine.

Oh, and PNC's response to people keeping logs of chats like this was to, apparently, ditch chat-based customer service. I haven't found a way to chat since.

Tomorrow is June 26, when the $200 transfer I posted this month gets processed. I will have been charged $30 over May-June for an account I didn't close because I was a huge fan of the bank. When I asked them at every turn what I could do to avoid charges.",finance,1435247834

personalfinance,Should I buy a house/rental property based on my current income and financial situation?,"Hi /r/personalfinance - long time lurker, first time poster. 

I'm here because I'm looking for any advice you may have with regards to my current situation and whether it would be prudent to invest money into a home. I plan on the home being an investment property that I can rent, but eventually one day live in.  

I've included as much detail below regarding my finances and situation. I would love any advice any of you may have.

About Me: I'm 29 Years Old living in Southern California. 

**What I am currently making:** 
I'm currently employed full-time and make $65,000/yr + Bonuses (that vary). Also my credit score is 750+. 

**What I have saved:** 
I have about $11,000 in a regular savings account that accrues no interest. Another Savings Account with about $15,000 accruing at a Current Annual Percentage Yield of 0.75%. **Total of $26,000.** 

**My Debt:** I have about $120,000 debt (Government Student Loans). The annual percentage for all loans consolidated is 7.5%. I have been making income based repayments and all that's doing is going towards the interest. I'm pretty much feel like the loans are drowning me. I attempted to refinance with SoFi once and was denied. I plan on trying again in order to get a lower interest rate, and possibly use my parents as a co-signor, but I've been told to hold off, since I might purchase a piece of property and want to keep my costs (on paper) low. 

**Expenses:** I have other expenses of course, including a car, insurance, gas, cell phone, cable interest etc. Luckily I live rent-free. My expenses total about $800-$1,000/mo. 

So based on my current situation, would it be prudent to purchase a home? With the money I have saved (26,000) + help from my parents ($50,000) - I would be able to put $76,000 down on a house valued around $400-500k. I would also have a co-signor help. 

But my question really is - would making such a big financial move help me? Is it a good idea? Properties around my area are lucrative and there is a huge rental market, so it wouldn't be hard to find a renter. And I'm thinking it may provide me some financial security. 

Any advice would be truly appreciated. I'm new to this sort of thing.",finance,1435249815

Last month I moved to another state for a job and incurred a lot of moving expenses that I put on my credit card. Some of the balance carried over (I'll have it all paid by the end of July). 

I called Chase and asked for them to lower my rate because I've been a customer of theirs for a few years, I've never been late on a payment, my credit score is pretty good at 728, and 22.99% is ridiculous. They said they couldn't do anything about it. I told them fine, I wont be using their card anymore and I will switch to another company. 

I occasionally get mail that says I'm pre-approved for 10.99-12% with various CC companies, with no interest for the first 12 months, no balance transfer fees, etc. and I usually just toss them in the trash because I didn't need another card.

personalfinance,Bigger mortgage to pay off student debt ?,"Hi Personal Finance,

I am about to take the plunge and buy a home with my SO. We have sold our condo and purchased a detached home.  We live in Ontario Canada in the GTA, so anyone familiar with the area understands the very high price of homes around here. 
So for some numbers, I made a profit of $52K off my condo after real-estate fees.  We purchased a home for $470K.  Now as I only have the $52K to use as a down payment (keeping about $10K in an emergency fund) and paying the closing costs of ~$8500 out of pocket, I have to pay CMHC fees for putting down less than 20%.  The fee was set to just over $10K with the $52K down.  
On to my question, my SO has some student debt that I am considering paying off and then putting down less of a down payment.  If I pay off the debt (which has an interest rate of more than double the mortgage), I will increase my monthly mortgage payment by about $150 per month but reduce my total monthly debt payments by $350.  So $200 less out of our pocket each month for the next 5 years.  However, this will increase the CMHC fees to $16K and leave us with very very little equity in the home (not like we have much in either scenario).  
Obviously, we are paying more interest in the long run by putting down less money, but it is nearly identical over the next 5 years.  I am worried about have such little equity, but I figure the first 5 years will be hardest on us and the less after-tax money out of our pockets, the better.
Am I missing something or is the paying down debt and taking the bigger mortgage the best option?",finance,1435251371

I have a private student loan $25,000 at a ridiculously low interest rate of 2.4% right now (it's variable).

personalfinance,"Sister has crushing debt, no college degree or resources, and needs help","My 36-year-old older sister revealed to me yesterday that she has been living underneath a crushing pile of debt for a decade, from which she has been unable to pull herself out. I am the only person in the entire world who knows about this; she has been too ashamed to tell anyone else in our family. She plays it off as though she is living the bohemian lifestyle (working minimum wage, living in warehouse with a bunch of artist-types) because she wants to stick it to the man, when in reality, it's the only lifestyle available to her. 

Apparently, when she was much younger- about 19 years old, living out of state and attending college- she got into a bad car accident. She spent some time in the hospital and wound up with thousands in bills. She took out some credit cards to help with expenses while paying these bills. Things got out of hand. She found that attending school prevented her from working enough hours to be able to pay for her living expenses and her minimum payments, so she dropped out. She had accumulated a fair amount of student loan debt at this point as well. The debt continued to grow throughout her twenties, but without a college degree she was unqualified for jobs that paid enough to ever make much of a dent in it. She tried going back to school a few times, but didn't do well and couldn't keep her finances under control. 

At this point she has 30,000 in credit card debt (on two cards), and 45,000 of federal student loan debt. She makes around 25k per year working two jobs. The credit cards both have high-ish interest rates (I don't recall the exact number, but it's not good). 

She has decided to go back to school, because she thinks she really needs a degree in order to finally land a job where she can actually start knocking the debt out. She's maxed out on federal loans, though, so she will need to take out private loans. She will also have to quit one of her jobs in order to attend school, and is very worried that she won't be able to continue to make her monthly payments.

My family is not in a good position to help her out financially, and neither am I, but surely there must be some resources or advice available to her.  I want to see her succeed at school and get on with life, but how can she continue to make her monthly CC payment of 600 *and* pay living expenses (about 1000 for necessaries: rent, bills, food, transportation) while only working one part-time minimum wage job? Is going back to school even the best strategy?

**TL;DR** my sister is about 75k in debt (credit cards and student loans), and wants to dig herself out but has no college degree or technical skills to land her a non minimum-wage job. Is putting herself in more debt to go back to school a good choice, and if so, how does she keep her debt under control while in school?

**EDIT** I would like to add that her credit is EXCELLENT. She has been making a minimum payment on all her debts every month for over a decade. She is really scared of declaring bankruptcy because her great credit is the only thing she has going for her at this point.",finance,1435259645

I have $400 emergency fund/savings and he has ~$2500. We are currently paying $1250/mo in rent. We could purchase a house for $185k, nothing down at 4.25% fixed 30yr mortgage, which including escrow would put us just under/around $1200/mo. So here's my question, where do we go from here? What should we do? Is buying a house wise? I used the calculator where you put in the house cost vs rent and it tells you ""It's worth it to buy unless you can find a house to rent for $x/mo"" and our current rent is above $x.

EDIT: I should've said the main reason we're looking at potentially buying is because the interest rates are turning around and are projected to start rising. Right now it's very much a ""buyers market"" and we'd like to cash in if possible.",finance,1435261494

personalfinance,Student loan question (xpost from r/medicalschool),"Hey all,

I have a question regarding student loans I am a current medical student starting my second year. Through my mother, I am able to get a 2.74% variable interest rate private loan from PNC bank. according to my mother, she can fix it at 3.25% (not sure how).

federal loans are at 6.8% or something like that, but they offer better payment options to my knowledge. Basically I am not sure which direction to go, or really what to think about this.
Can anybody offer any advice or suggestions? 

Thank you.

**edit**: I just spoke to my mom. She said she has taken out a ""Home Equity Loan"" on our house. She took the loan out in her and my dad's name (obviously I do not want my parents to be paying back stuff for my school. I'm not a shithead son). She thinks this is more advantageous for me, but my concerns are

1. I feel terrible that my parents are paying back my loans
2. Will I still be able to get federal government loans for years 3 and 4?

I don't have the money right now, and will only be able to pay it off two months from now, unless I take a personal loan with high interest rates which I really want to avoid. When I borrowed it from her, she knew I'd be able to pay it back in August, but now she wants it back immediately, and is threatening legal action I don't. There are emails and conversations which show that I borrowed the money via a bank transfer, but I have always maintained that I would be returning it in August. If she sues, what will happen? What will the process be like? Will I be compelled to return it immediately? Will it be a long process that will take so much time or money that it won't be sensible to pursue it on court for her? Is she bluffing? 

She knows I'll pay her back in August, but she wants it now and feels since it's her money, she could sue me today, get the money back somehow and give me a headache in the process. I need advice on this, because I really want to avoid getting a personal loan now, and paying 8% or more for $10k.

personalfinance,"(US, AR) I am quite unhappy with my current homelife, but moving is intimidating me.","A bit of background on myself:
23 years old, 1 semester from graduating with a degree in Computer Information Systems. Currently manager for a small local business making a whopping $8.50 an hour (oh boy!). I enjoy my job as I get to control my hours for the most part and it's not very physical (rental store).  

Lately my home life has been getting worse and I've been seriously contemplating moving. I do pay rent here, albiet not much, and my overall bills are fairly low. I spend a lot of my money on eating out at the moment, but I know that would have to change if I did move. 

I do keep a budget of what I spend right and track everything in a spreadsheet. Here's what my monthly budget looks like as of this moment (I also keep an updated weekly one):

http://i.imgur.com/cQvnB0w.png

So you see my bills are fairly low at the moment. I do budget out for fun (max of $200/mo) and that typically is just going to dinner/movies every other week or something along those lines.

So I estimated my total bills if I leave based off what my friends paying in the apartment complex I'd likely be moving to. They're pretty nice apartments and the landlord is a really nice older gentleman that's a regular at the store I run, so I know the addition is a nice place to live (other than the neighbors dogs, but I can handle that).

If I moved into that apartment, my bills would roughly look like this:

http://i.imgur.com/0jUTR6E.png

I'd be able to increase my monthly income by ~200/mo by getting 40 hours/week (at the moment I don't schedule myself for 40/wk). This wouldn't be enough though, so I'd likely have to get a different job. There's an opening at the bank nearby that's more or less $1400/mo guaranteed and is an in-side desk job (I've worked at factories before and DO NOT want to go back to that). It's pretty stressful mentally, but seems to be alright as they have fairly low turnover and pay decently.

If I got that job, it'd be:

JRMC (medical): $406 (Paying $10/month with NO interest because they screwed up MAJORLY on the bill at first)

Care Credit (medical): $150 (Paying $25/mo with no interest for the next 8 months)

I searched for the answer on the net and can't get a solid answer, only bits of information. 

My girlfriend's checks became a lot smaller recently, I was reading through her past pay stubs to figure out why, and it's obviously because of her taxes. 

On the larger pay checks I was using to compare with, there are no fed or state taxes deducted at all! The filing status is s 99, which I have learned that is common, but I still don't get exactly what s 99 does. 

Then at some point from January to now. I believe around April her taxes went from s 99 to s 0 and have been deducted from the checks.

financialindependence,Should I opt into my employers FSA?,"I have done some searching on this sub on Flexible Spending Accounts, and most of what I have found has to do with comparing FSA's to HSA's. The company that I work for only offers a FSA. What my wife and I are trying to determine is if it is worthwhile for us to sign up for?

The plan allows me to contribute a maximum of $2500, and a minimum of $120. I am only able to roll over $500 to the next year, and anything I don't use, I lose.

Some background:

Right now it is just my wife(25) and I(24), but we are expecting our first child in October. We just purchased a house, in the mid-west for $49,900, 0% down VA loan at 3.625% interest rate. Our monthly payment is $367 a month which includes taxes and insurance. 

I make about $35,000-$40,000 a year, and I just opted in to contribute 6% of my income to my companies 401k, and they match $.50 for every $ I contribute. 

We currently have $6,000 in my TSP, in the furthest out retirement fund they offered at the time. 

We also have a Roth IRA with Vanguard, that I recently started contributing to again. It has about $7,700 in it, and I want to continue contributing about $1000/month towards it until I max it out. It is in the target retirement fund 2055, which is the furthest out that was available at the time.

Besides the mortgage, we do not have any other debt. I plan on paying slightly more on my mortgage than what we owe each month, but I don't plan on paying it off much earlier because we will just throw money at our different retirement accounts.

Basically what I am wondering is if the FSA is worth it for me to contribute to?

* Going back to school while working Trying to get a B.S in CS, and then a M.A in CS. I have a B.S in Econ and a B.A in Polisci (bad GPA can't get into a masters program directly)

**Current job**

* I currently work as a Software QA analyst at an IT company in Ann arbor (big pizza company, going through a good time). I make 65k (contractor), I get 13 days of PTO, and in 6 months I can get a raise. However they are not so friendly when it comes to me going to school.

* I have only been there for 6 months, and the commute really sucks (take a total of 2:30 hours to drive everyday combined), but I just feel like it is much more secure than the other company. They are much more reputable in the industry and are doing automation (Advance QA skills that I am learning, programming in java). Also they may hire me on without the contracting company in 6 months.

**Prospective job**


* I have another job offer for a company called Fordirect, and they are offering 70k (contractor), and 7 more vacation days, it is also is about 35 minutes away from my parents house. I feel as though this position is not very secure, and the company is not very reputable. I also don't know how I leaving a job just after 6 months looks on a resume. This company does manual testing only, and there is no automation. However they are really friendly with me going to school, and they said they will work around it a bit. 



**Income and assets**

* I live at home, and I am currently going through a medical debt crisis. 

* 4,200 a month in income, could be about 4,600 if I take the new job. 

* 4k in the bank, one car that is hybrid &gt; 60 MPG yo (no payments).

**Expenses (1300 a month total)**


* Live at home. 
* 250 a month for medical insurance.
* 100 a month for auto insurance.
* 300 to pay my parents for being awesome.
* 100 for fuel.
* 100 for Misc (food and such)
* 50 for phone.
* 500 a month payments to credit cards. 
* Closing in on my credit card debit, and will have it finished in 4 months.

* I have 22k in medical debt (Short term insurance denied my claim because of a preexisting condition). Which I was expecting because I bought it for the sole purpose of being operated on quickly because of a fast growing tumor (I am doing okay now).  

* 17k from the hospital and hospital does not want to give in because of my income, I want to refuse to pay and settle for 10k, but they won't have it :( even though they are giving the upsell rate. 

* 1.7k in credit card debt

* 22k in student debt, but don't have to pay because I am taking community college classes (interest rates are at a total of 3 percent on average).


**What to do?**


* Do I stay at home, and take the commute until I can get out of debt? 
* Do I stay at home and take the other job and try to close in on the debt faster? 
* Do I get a lawyer to handle the hospital?

I'm extremely worried about her, and I feel really sorry for her. We had a traumatic childhood where she took the worst of it, and she had a traumatic time in high school.

I know the 24% interest toolbox payment needs to be remedied first, and the extra money every week from my extra hours/labor should help me get that paid off within the next ~6 months.

Here lies my problem.  I'm a single 33 year old, I know I can't keep this pace up forever, it's constantly 90 degrees in the shop during the summer months and I'm at work so much that I have no time for anything but work.  I have zero in savings/retirement/investments and have been holding steady at keeping ~$1000 in my checking account.  I want to reduce my debt to a point that I can afford to work less hours and actually have a life.  I know I need an emergency fund, but I'm unsure whether to prioritize that over paying off the ridiculous interest rate on my toolbox.  I frequent this sub when I can, but as stated I don't have much time to put into anything other than work and am hoping my internet friends will have some good advice for me :D",finance,1435289921
personalfinance,"As a new attorney, just helped our family firm close its biggest case in our history. Depositing the check tomorrow. Now what?","I passed the bar a few years ago, was soon junior attorney at my firm, and have since become partner.  We closed one of the biggest cases in our history, and after taxes, overhead, and paying off all credit card debt, I will have netted just over $100,000.  I currently have 1 car payment at $480 a month, with 30k left on the loan.  I believe I have a 4.1% interest rate, but it's not right in front of me.  I want to say it was about 3-4k in interest over the life of the loan, which was 5 years.  As you may be able to tell by now, my math skills are sub-par at best, which is another reason I'm here.  I have under 1k in my checking and about 1k in savings.  I have an IRA that I've contributed about $5,000 to, and it was opened 7 years ago.  

My questions:  I am trying to build credit in order to qualify for a loan on a new home.  I don't have negative credit, just really little credit history, so I'm trying to establish more credit.  I have a few credit cards that I usually keep to a minimum, and I always pay on time.  Am I better served, for credit purposes, paying off the balance of the truck loan in full (no penalty for doing so, checked beforehand) or am I better served putting the money into an account, and paying the loan off each month?  If the latter, is there a certain type of investment or account that would yield higher interest that I should consider?  

My other question:  In terms of buying a home, I'm a year or two off from doing so.  Should I just put the money in a savings account and leave until ready to purchase?  Or are there other ways to get better returns in that time frame?

personalfinance,Neat Tricks to Get Your Debt under Control,"Most people have some form of debt in their lives, and, for more than a few, their debt is quite substantial. From car loans and credit cards to monthly bills and home loans, financial burdens can feel never-ending. There are many options for personal loans through reliable financial institutions such as Heritage Bank, which will help you feel more in control of your current debt. Click here for some handy financial calculators that can help get your debt under control.


Debt Under Control

Debt Consolidation

What makes it particularly hard to get your debt under control is when you are trying to manage multiple sources of debt. A neat trick to solve this problem is to combine or consolidate your debt into the one repayment. Your bank will be able to talk you through debt consolidation under the one interest rate, which is designed to make your repayments easier to manage. This can include combining your car and home loans and covering any other personal debts such as your credit card.

 

Cancel your Credit

Although it might be a nice feeling to know you have back-up money in the way of a credit card, this type of account is one of the quickest and easiest ways to get yourself stuck in long-term debt. Paying off your credit card as soon as possible will ease your financial burden, placing you in a more confident position when it comes to increasing your savings. If paying off credit is getting too difficult, take out a personal loan to cover the amount. This means you can close the credit account immediately, and your debt will be paid off in a fixed term.

 

Cut Back

Usually easier said than done, cutting back on miscellaneous expenses is one of the most effective ways to locate more money that can go towards reducing your debt. The simplest way to determine what funds can be redistributed to pay off your debt is to work out a budget—and then be strict with yourself. Cut back on eating out, buy more generic brands when shopping and reassess your Internet, phone and electricity plans.

 

Seek Professional Advice

Debt can be daunting enough, let alone when you have to try and sort through it all by yourself. If you’re becoming overwhelmed by your financial position, look at seeking advice on what your options are from a professional. Financial institutions and accountants will offer a breakdown of what you owe, and what payment plans will be the most effective for you. They can also provide budget calculators, so you can see exactly what your income is and where every cent is going.

From personal relationships to your emotional health, debt can affect every aspect of your life once it gets out of control. This is why you need to make sure your debt is being managed correctly in order to avoid these pitfalls. Neat tricks such as the ones above are great starting points to get you on track to making your repayments quicker and finding financial freedom.

investing,"Affordable logistics solutions, the future is now | iContainers","More than 60 people attended the seminar about **how to import goods succesfully into the U.S this week in Miami**. Banco Sabadell held the event, where the discussion aimed at helping businesses leverage supply chain resources in South Florida to [import goods from Spain to the United States!](http://www.icontainers.com/us/ocean-freight/united-states-spain/door-to-door/). And the message is clear: affordable logistics solutions are already here to make it easier. Once more, the potential of Miami as a trade epicenter for the whole American continent was highlighted.

Guests from diverse companies like Carmen and Lola, Ameriworld, Roca, Ecofactor Florida, Club Expats, and institutions like Ivace, Extenda or Confederación Empresarios Gallegos en USA followed the event. For the first time in Miami, a big review of the importing process was the focus.

The seminar provided a panoramic look at the logistic process and all the requirements needed to import goods into the U.S. iContainers offered tips about the various steps in the process; Inmaculada Gutierrez, representative of the Spanish Trade Commission, encouraged seminar attendees to reinforce the Spanish investment in the American market; and Mario Velo, from Banco Sabadell, provided financial information about how to do it.

The members of the roundtable wanted to share their experiences along these years in the U.S: Pedro González from Encofrados Alsina, Sergio Davo from Zumex and Baubak Askari from Vintae/Askari OH. The Q&amp;A revealed the increasing interest of the companies about the changes at major ports, like the new Canal de Panamá or the upcoming business oportunities with Cuba.

The audience was interested in iContainers‘ online price aggregation technology. This new system simplifies the reservation process of overseas shipping while eliminating hidden charges and bringing transparency to the shipping industry. The iContainers software platform operates much like Expedia, Kayak and Skyscanner, travel sites that aggregate airline fares, hotel prices, and vacation getaways. [iContainers!](http://www.icontainers.com) does the same for shippers, giving customers the ability to peruse shipping companies and prices.

Industry watchers say these freight forwarders will make shipping less expensive because their margins are lower. Shipping lines will start dropping prices to better compete for customers. Businesses that shied away from importing and exporting will likely enter the market. And in the end, consumers might just see the price of goods – even luxury items – dropping. Online travel sites have changed how we travel, now it’s turn to see how online freight forwarders will change the way we do business internationally and how we shop.",finance,1435306154
personalfinance,"[Debt]I'm 18, FICO Score of 763, Solid Job Market, No Income, and I want to take out a student loan. Is it possible?","Hey PF!

I recently opened up a new Discover Card, which gives me my FICO Score. Three years of consistent payments that my dad made on a CapitalOne card with me as an Authorized User did me well, giving me a score of 763. I have no income, but I will be going to a very good college majoring in Cyber Intelligence &amp; Security, and hoping to get a good job in the cyber security world between my freshman and sophomore year of college (The job market is amazing for us right now). I'm currently pursuing several Cyber Certifications, like LPIC-1 and CCNA, which should help me get my foot into the door. After looking around at jobs, it looks like base pay for my career is in the 70's/80's/yr, and pretty much skyrockets as I get more certifications. 

Problem with everything is that I need about $20k to get me through my first year of college. I have maxed out all of my aid and federal loans, and am still about $15k short for direct fees (meal plan, housing, tuition). My hope is that I'll be able to pay for college with my hypothetical job after my first year.

My real question is: Is it possible for me to get a loan for that much, taking into account my high job security, no current income, and my credit score? If so, how should I go about doing it?

personalfinance,(US) Looking for an unbiased view on my budgets and where I can improve. No need to upvote.,"First off, let me start by saying, I am very aware of my personal finances, probably more than anyone I know. This sub has helped me a lot. I set up a budget immediately after I graduated in 2012 and stuck to it somewhat seriously in the beginning but recently have gotten a lot more vigilant about. I’d say I’m doing pretty well financially, but feel like I can do better and that is the primary reason for this post. I want an unbiased view on all my monthly budgets to see where I can improve. I’ll try to provide some commentary as to why the number is what it is.

**Some information about me:** 

Age: 24 

Occupation: Engineering

Emergency fund: Between 3 and 4 months of expenses

Living situation: Living with roommates (unmarried/no kids) in city where the cost of living is high compared to the rest of the country (US)

Total debt: ~35k (15k student loan at 4.875% and 20k auto loan at 1.99%) 

Retirement Contribution: take full advantage of my company’s 401k match (100% match up to 3% of salary and 50% match for the next 3%)

**Budgets (per month):**

**Rent: $800**

Based on the city I live in, this can’t really get any cheaper

**Food and Dining: $450**

I know this is where I’m going to get hammered and I’m trying to get this number down. ~$350 of this is for groceries and the remaining $100 is for my SO and me to “treat” ourselves and eat out. 

*Groceries:* I’m very into physical fitness and have a very fined tuned diet. I eat 6 small meals per day and as a result eat a lot of meat (~11 to 12 pounds of chicken per week). I waste almost no food though. I buy a lot of frozen vegetables, no snacks and other non-perishable food stuff in bulk. Basically if I buy it, it gets eaten. 

*Dining Out:* If I was single this would probably be eliminated because I almost never order out. I suppose my SO and I could eat at cheaper places but food is my SO’s “language of love” so eating out less than twice a month is not much of an option. We typically split the bill down the middle and the bill is usually close to $100 each time we “indulge”. And, yes, when we go out we go the whole nine yards, wine, an appetizer, entrees and dessert. 

**Gas: ~$200**

This is kind of an unknown for me because I just recently bought a new car (which the advice from this sub helped me get a hell of a deal on). Up until a couple weeks ago I was driving a very old vehicle with over 200k miles that got about 12 mpgs. I loved that car to death but it finally kicked the bucket last month, so I upgraded. I was spending ~$250 a month with the older vehicle and the new car gets much better gas mileage with a smaller engine so I figured this was a conservative estimate. 

**Car Insurance: $158**

Spent weeks looking for the best rate and this is what I got. I have a poor driving history from when I was 17-20. Did some stupid things that I’m still paying for. The company I’m with offers a significantly reduced rate if I pay in full every 6 months, which I do. I just pull the premium divided by 6 out of my paycheck every month and throw it in a savings account.

**Utilities: $100**

In the year that I've lived in my apartment the utilities have only been over $100 once ($105). They are consistently right around $100 though. 

**Gym: $55**

This is the going rate for the city I live in that has everything I need. Some people may think it’s high but like I said it’s pretty much my only hobby and I get my money’s worth because I go 5 or 6 times a week. The gym just recently offered a promotion to change the monthly rate to $20. However, it requires a large upfront cost that and eliminates some perks that I have now. The savings for the first year would only be $30 and I’m kind of hedging my bets here because I’m hoping to move out of the city I’m in within the year. If I stay longer than a year, the $20 a month is obviously a much better deal.

**Everything else: $500**

Literally encompasses everything else that doesn't fall into these categories. Some unexpected large expenses obviously come up but over the last couple months I’ve gotten much better at hitting this number.


**EDIT:** Example of last month's everything else expenses for those who are asking

$26 (Uber)

$170 (registration cost for a professional test I took)

$70 (bars)

$104 (SO's birthday gift)

$26 (bought a shirt at Target)

$50 (monthly payment on a mattress I bought from Macy's several months ago. Got interest free financing for a year)

$13 (Miscellaneous food that I don't include in my food budget like coffee and ice cream because they're not real food to me, I don't know it's a mental thing.)

$73 (state excise tax)

Total:$532

I guess, because I don't have individual categories it seems like I'm not tracking my ""everything else"" category but that it what I track the most. All my other categories are typically the same every month

**Savings: 5%**

I save 5% of my monthly salary and throw it in a Barclays Savings account (1.05% APY) labeled “Self/Vacation”. It’s basically exactly what it sounds like, money that I can use to spend on myself (clothes, toys, events, etc.) and/or use to travel.

**Student loans: $700**

This is more of an average. I am enrolled in the ACH and have the minimum payment automatically deducted at some point during the month to take advantage of the .25% interest rate reduction. On the last day of every month I do my finances and calculate how much is remaining. Whatever amount is left over (monthly pay less the expenses above) I send to my college loans. This number is typically around $700. This number will decrease starting in August when I have to make my first car payment which will be $295. Once the car payment kicks in, if everything remains stable, I should have my school loans paid off by September of 2017.

I have been reading lately arguments against contributing directly to Roth IRAs but instead to contribute to Traditional IRAs and convert to Roth through the conversion ladder method, once I am semi-retired and making low enough income to stay in the 15% tax bracket. However, while a Traditional IRA will allow me to deduct for federal taxes, my contributions for MA state taxes are not deductible.

Per the link above, distributions are""taxable above Massachusetts previously taxed contributions"". However, since I have no desire to retire in Massachusetts, I suspect that could mean double taxation down the road if I make the conversions in a different state (unless I move to Florida or Texas, but I have no guarantee of that).

So ultimately, my question is this. If I am intending to use the Roth Conversion Ladder for FI but not necessarily in the same state, would you consider it still worth it to contribute to the Traditional IRA even though I still will pay the same amount in state taxes? Or would you just go directly with Roth?",finance,1435333197

We will be receiving half of it up front as a lump sum, with the 2nd half being paid out over the next 18 months, bi-weekly, in her paychecks. The lump sum after taxes is just over $30k, with the other $30k coming via the paychecks. We aren't sure what we should be doing with it. 

We currently make about $3500 a paycheck, twice a month. This will go up due to the nature of our work, plus her other half of the money. 

We pay about $800 a month for rent with no utility costs because of living arrangements. We live in different states and both just rent rooms from people at fixed rates. 

We pay $150 a month for cell phones. 

We have paid off our student debt. 

We currently just have a car loan of $15. This is $450 s month. 

My wife thinks it might be better to not just pay it off in one payment since it is a manageable amount with an interest rate of 1.49%. 

We have a small dog who eats about $30 in food a month. We don't have any children. 

We both spend roughly $200  a month on gas driving to see each other on the weekends. We also spend another $300 or so a month on activities like movies and dinners. 

We spend about $200 each on food a month. 


Then we put the rest into a generic savings account that we have had since we were teens or we spend some on things like video games or stuff.

We usually put this all on our credit cards to get reward miles and cash back. We normally have $1100 to $1800 on our credit card each month, which is about a 14 to 18 percent utilization. We always pay it off in full each month since we don't ever use the debit card and only use the credit card. 

We are just wondering what we should put this money towards? Should we just pay off the car? Should we invest it in something? Should we be putting our money somewhere else?

* Car Payment - High Interest Rate, too late to refinance (would only save $20/month)
* Federal Taxes for This Year - $1200 (no payment plan setup, yet)
* Old Medical Bills - Mostly Under $100 Each (2-3 bills)
* Federal Student Loans - Deferred until 2016 - $7.5k left (have not paid interest, on 2nd year of deferment)
* Cox Cable - Owe for Cable Box Not Turned In - $150
* Previous apartment claims damage after move-out - $250
* Private student loan through B of A - $50/monthly - $1500 remaining - Low interest

personalfinance,Situation not that bad but need piece of mind,"Background:  30 yr old, married, twins age 3.  

Debts:
Mortgage:  $1800/monthly, 253k left, condo, purchased for 279k.

HOA fees:  $628 monthly (was originally $450 but HOA needed a special assessment for repairs about 20k per owner on a 15 year loan)

Credit Card # 1:  14k, 17% interest, min payment about $290

Credit Card # 2:  6K, 0% interest for 6 more months, Min payment about $70.

Car Loan:  14k left, paying $450 a month

Childrens school:  $700 for both, monthly starting in Sept.

Income:
My Take home after benefits:  $4282
Wifes take home:  $2300
Total:  $6582

I don't think the situation is that bad and in theory I should have more than enough income to be able to get ourselves out of this debt building.  The condo is drowning us since the HOA did the special assessment.  They are redoing the entire place which should raise the value of the condo up, in which we plan on selling after the work is done.  But we need to prepare for a down payment and such and I would like to remove the majority of the debt and save some money before trying to sell our place and get a new home.  

We want to move from a condo into a single family home, one to have a yard and private garage but also to get rid of the HOA fees.  

The plan is to remove all debt first, build a down payment fund (we only have about 3k in savings accounts right now), sell our place and possibly pay off the 20k special assessment loan with the equity or try to find a buyer willing to take it on and then settle into a modest single family home.

Now we are at 14k.  Lavish I know....So a long talk with the wife is in order.

Also, pay off the card with the 14k and interest rate and minimum pay everything else until it is gone and go on a cash system where we only spend cash and never use the card.  Good ideas?",finance,1435340865
personalfinance,21 years old looking to buy my first car looking for financial advice,"Hi /r/personalfinance, I'm a 21yo college student driving a very crappy late 90's pontiac. I paid 1200 for it and already dumped about 1600 into over the past year and a half I've had it. 

I've managed to save $1000 for a down payment although I don't plan on actually buying a car until October and by then I plan to have $1500 for a down payment. I don't want to buy new as I know that's  a big mistake for someone like me (young,  dumb,  etc.). 

My weekly income ranges between $100 to $200, depending on how much freelance work I pick up on the side of my shitty retail job. Would it be reasonable for me to go into car hunting with the mentality to have monthly payments at about $100 if I'm putting this decent down payment on it and have a cap of $5000 for a car bugdet (would $4000 be more reasonable?). Also what would be a good interest rate for someone my age,  7%? I know absolutely  nothing about car buying,  my dad picked out my current car and I simply paid him in two bulk payments.

personalfinance,Landed a job and now have some basic questions,"Alright, I know this has been asked a bazzillion times. I have just received a at a tech start up making close to 45k. That being said they match a 401k up to 5%, that I put the max amount into each month. They also provide full medical/dental so that is one less thing I need to worry about. 

Now before we go any further, here is my issue. Up to this point I was working service industry for most of my life and was living fairly hand to mouth(I am 30). Two winters ago I had an accident that landed me in the hospital with 60k in debt, I could not work for ~2 months where my only means of survival was credit cards (I did not have an emergency fund) which totaled another 6k. That being said I was looking roughly 66k in total. 

That being said I have cancelled my credit line as I could not pay the minimums with the job I had, and worked out a payment plan with them which is now down to around 3.5k My hospital bills I was able to get a financial need scholarship through the hospital which lowered the amount to around 15k, which I have been able to lower to roughly 12k over the past 2 years.  

Here are my plans/goals/questions. Please tell me if I am thinking this through correctly, or if I need to change things.  

1. Put 1000 away for an emergency fund (small I know, but its a start)
2. Continue to put the max they will match in the 401k
3. Place an additional monthly amount in emergency fund until I have 3 months of bills saved (or maybe 6?)

Now question time.

After getting my basic emergency fund squared away. Where should I go from there. I have read things like pay off the lowest debt lines first, highest first, highest interest rates (no applicable in my case). 

My monthly payments up to this point have been crippling, after making my payments and paying my bills there were months where I would have less than 15 dollars to last to the end of the month. 

Do I pay off the credit card first? And lower my payments with the hospital so I can pay off the credit card quicker? Should the plan be the other way around? 

My credit score is abysmally low, I was hoping to start rebuilding that so at some point in the future (3-5 years) the option of buying a home would not be an unreal expectation (if it is, I get it). 

I have a budget pretty well placed, I don't plan on really raising my life style, except for eating less $.89 burritos from the market, and getting a gym membership that I have been wanting. 

These things being said how much should I be throwing at my debt? Every extra dime I have, or should I pay raise the payments  and create a savings accounts so I can use it to help pay off items in larger chucks?

As for the ideas of possibly raising credit, any ideas on how to go about doing so?

I know this has been asked a lot, and I have done research on my own I have just read lots of conflicting opinions on how to go about accomplishing these goals I have.

Thanks in advance.

investing,How hedge-fund geniuses got beaten by monkeys — again,"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-hedge-fund-geniuses-got-beaten-by-monkeys-again-2015-06-25  

**Excerpts**:  

The average hedge fund has produced a worse investment performance in the first half of this year than a portfolio consisting of a savings account at your local bank and a random collection of stocks picked by a blindfolded monkey.

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. 

... **Hedge-fund defenders object that it’s not fair to compare funds directly to the stock market, because hedge funds are “managing risk” and so on. You have to compare them to an overall balanced portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash, right?**

OK.

A few years back a study conducted on behalf of the endowment of Cambridge University’s Clare College found that, historically, the best risk-managed simple portfolio for a long-term investor had usually been a balance of 80% stocks and 20% cash (or equivalent, such as Treasury bills), rebalanced once a year.

You can play around with simple portfolios but this will do as well as any. It’s about as simple as you can get.

Someone who put 20% of their money in a federally insured bank savings account, and the other 80% in a random collection of stocks from around the world, picked by monkeys, would be up about 6.2% so far this year. (And that’s assuming for the sake of simplicity that you earned 0% interest on the savings. In reality, you could have done slightly better)

In other words, they would still have earned more than twice the returns of the average hedge fund.

Gosh, the money and effort that goes into those hedge funds really paid off, didn’t it?",finance,1435344644

personalfinance,Wife to receive $290K life insurance payout. Looking for input on how to allocate it towards a home purchase and more.,"My wife’s father passed away months back and after going through the slow, bureaucratic process of jumping through hoops for the government (he was a federal employee) we finally received notification from the insurance company that we would be receiving his life insurance payout within 10 days or so (roughly $290K).  

&amp;nbsp;  

I have lurked this board for a while.  I feel that I’ve got us going in the right direction financially (I will detail this below).  I’ve also familiarized myself with the [winfall]( http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) section and the [""I have $X, What Do I Do With It?""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and have sent this information on to my wife for her to read.  I didn’t really see any information about considerations on house purchases so I came here to get some clarification.  

&amp;nbsp;  

######**Pertinent info**  

&amp;nbsp;  

* My SO and I (both recently turned 30) make combined roughly $90K (this should go up to roughly $105k soon due to my wife’s promotion) in a metropolitan area of Florida.  We currently have no kids or obligations.  
* Budget-wise we generally save, at most, $500 monthly (although usually less or sometimes negative, currently working on getting a stricter handle on this and eliminating all wastes).  
* Cash on hand + emergency fund: $40K in bank accounts.  
* Retirement  
	1. My 401k - $61K balance / 4% match / current contribution 10%
	2. Wife’s 401k - $14K balance / no match / not currently contributing
	3. My ROTH - $8K balance / currently maxing 
	4. Wife’s ROTH - $4K balance / currently maxing
	5. My HSA - $500 balance / $500 annual contribution / $750 annual employer contribution  
* Debt  
	1. Car loan - $11K balance / 2.5% interest rate (not too concerned about paying this off)  
	2. We carry no credit card debt.  

&amp;nbsp;  

###### **Questions**  

&amp;nbsp;  

1. We want to purchase a house in roughly the $180K price range.  Should we purchase one outright? (i.e. would it be better to have our portfolio be ~= 75% real estate instead of financing some ambiguous “x” amount on the purchase?)  
2. Should we bump our emergency fund up to roughly 12 months’ worth of expenses? We both have stable jobs in stable fields.  
3. Should we have an “Oh $^!+” account of roughly $1K with the rest of our emergency fund in something slightly less liquid? (CDs – staggered)  
4. Should we up all our pre-tax retirement contribution amounts? (If we purchase a house outright, based on some rough calculations, we’ll be saving $700 a month [$1,200 rent payment gone minus roughly $500 a month in taxes and insurance based on some quick research for where I live].  And this is not factoring in the rise in income from my wife’s promotion.   
5. What to do with the sizeable amount left? ($60k+) Before we knew anything about this payout we had discussed a 2 week Europe trip which we had estimated to cost $12K, but besides that we don’t really want for anything.  
6. Should we consult a CPA? I read where life insurance payouts are not taxable, but I’d like to be assured.  
7.  Is there anything else I should be thinking of or consider?

I just graduated pharmacy school and I will be starting my career as a hospital pharmacist in the next few weeks. Over the course of my schooling I have acquired a solid amount of credit card debt (~$9000 out of an ~$11,000 limit split between two cards) and a very large school loan (roughly $220,000, with various interest rates ranging from 5.4% - 7.9% between the individual loans). My credit used to be some-what decent (730’s) but with the ~90% utilization and a few late payments on my cards, it has dropped to 610. I signed up for Mint and Mint Bills, and that has been a very helpful the last couple of months for alerting me of when bills are due and viewing spending habits.  

In the next week or two I’ll be moving for this job and I’ll have to pay for housing, utilities, food, gas, car insurance, phone bill. I’m lucky enough to be making roughly $110,000/year, so I have hope of remedying this situation and successfully being able to plan for the future. At the moment I do not have any money in my bank account or savings, but I am fortunate enough to have my fiancée that is supporting me at the moment to pay the bills and minimums on my credits cards; school loans won’t have payments due until 11/15.

My plan so far is to get settled in to my new place (going to find something to rent ~$800-1100) and eliminate the credit card debt ASAP. From there, I would pay minimum on my student loans and build a 6 month safety fund. Once I have a safety fund, I would put any income that I can towards my student loans. Not really sure what else I should be doing, or if there is a different approach I should consider.

Also, my fiancée and I will get married in the not too distant future and we want to potentially own a home. How should I plan for this?

On a side note, I read into goodwill letters on the late payments for my credit cards, but I was thinking of contacting one of the big name credit repair services. Is this worth it? Also, I was thinking of finding a financial planner; is there any benefit to this in my situation?

I'm going to be starting graduate school this coming Fall, and will likely be taking out Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans (5.84% interest) to cover much, if not all, of my education expenses and living expenses for the year.

I am currently in light debt from my undergrad years over four different loans. One of the loans has slightly less than $2000 on it, is an unsubbed Direct Stafford Loan, and has a 6.8% fixed interest rate.

Given that both loans are unsubsidized (and accrue interest while in deferment), would it be financially prudent for me to leverage more grad school loan debt and use that to directly pay off the balance of my high interest loan?

Is making that decision as simple as ""loan A has a higher interest rate, loan B potentially has a lower, so I should use loan B to pay for loan A""?

I assume origination fees play into it, but considering (IIRC) they are less than 1%, it wouldn't be a huge consideration?

Thank you!",finance,1435392514

politics,"Compiled each of the Supreme Court Justice remarks on Friday's same sex marriage decision, along with the trascript of President Obama's address to the nation.","[Each Justice’s remarks on the verdict](https://trove.com/a/10-key-lines-from-the-Supreme-Court-decision-and-dissent-%E2%80%94-and-why-they-mattered.ivFRW?nocrawl=1&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=sns&amp;utm_campaign=hosted)  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity. The petitioners in these cases seek to find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same terms and conditions as marriages between persons of the opposite sex.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority’s approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens — through the democratic process — to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution — even as confined to opposite-sex relations — has evolved over time.
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution’s central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**    
No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. [The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit^pdf](http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/14a0275p-06.pdf) is reversed. It is so ordered.  

**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
Judges are selected precisely for their skill as lawyers; whether they reflect the policy views of a particular constituency is not (or should not be) relevant. Not surprisingly then, the Federal Judiciary is hardly a cross-section of America. Take, for example, this Court, which consists of only nine men and women, all of them successful lawyers who studied at Harvard or Yale Law School. Four of the nine are natives of New York City. Eight of them grew up in east- and west-coast States. Only one hails from the vast expanse in-between. Not a single Southwesterner or even, to tell the truth, a genuine Westerner (California does not count). Not a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about one quarter of Americans), or even a Protestant of any denomination. The strikingly unrepresentative character of the body voting on today’s social upheaval would be irrelevant if they were functioning as judges, answering the legal question whether the American people had ever ratified a constitutional provision that was understood to proscribe the traditional definition of marriage. But of course the Justices in today’s majority are not voting on that basis; they say they are not. And to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.  
  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority's opinion:**  
These considerations lead to the conclusion that the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the [Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. [Baker v. Nelson^pdf](http://www.leg.state.mn.us/webcontent/lrl/issues/SameSexMarriages/BakerNelson.pdf) must be and now is overruled, and the State laws challenged by Petitioners in these cases are now held invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite sex couples.  
  
**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: “The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,” I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.  
  
  
  
  
  
[President Obama’s address](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/06/26/transcript-obamas-remarks-on-supreme-court-ruling-on-same-sex-marriage/)  
Our nation was founded on a bedrock principle that we are all created equal. The project of each generation is to bridge the meaning of those founding words with the realities of changing times — a never-ending quest to ensure those words ring true for every single American.  
Progress on this journey often comes in small increments. Sometimes two steps forward, one step back, compelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.  
This morning, the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality. In doing so, they have reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law; that all people should be treated equally, regardless of who they are or who they love.  
This decision will end the patchwork system we currently have. It will end the uncertainty hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples face from not knowing whether they’re marriage, legitimate in the eyes of one state, will remain if they decide to move or even visit another.  
This ruling will strengthen all of our communities by offering to all loving same-sex couples the dignity of marriage across this great land.  
In my second inaugural address, I said that if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. It is gratifying to see that principle enshrined into law by this decision.  
This ruling is a victory for Jim Obergefell and the other plaintiffs in the case. It’s a victory for gay and lesbian couples who have so long for their basic civil rights. It’s a victory for their children, whose families will now be recognized as equal to any other. It’s a victory for the allies and friends and supporters who spent years, even decades working and praying for change to come.  
And this ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free.  
My administration has been guided by that idea. It’s why we stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and why we were pleased when the court finally struck down the central provision of that discriminatory law. It’s why we ended, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”  
From extending full marital benefits to federal employees and their spouses to expanding hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients and their loved ones, we’ve made real progress in advancing equality for LGBT Americans in ways that were unimaginable not too long ago.  
I know a change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long. But compared to so many other issues, America’s shift has been so quick.  
I know that Americans of good will continue to hold a wide range of views on this issue. Opposition, in some cases, has been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs. All of us who welcome today’s news should be mindful of that fact and recognize different viewpoints, revere our deep commitment to religious freedom.  
But today should also give us hope that on the many issues with which we grapple, often painfully, real change is possible. Shift in hearts and minds is possible. And those who have come so far on their journey to equality have a responsibility to reach back and help others join them, because for all of our differences, we are one people, stronger together than we could ever be alone. That’s always been our story.  
We are big and vast and diverse, a nation of people with different backgrounds and beliefs, different experiences and stories but bound by the shared ideal that no matter who you are or what you look like, how you started off or how and who you love, America is a place where you can write your own destiny.  
We are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is so much more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to every American. But today, we can say in no uncertain terms that we’ve made our union a little more perfect.  
That’s the consequence of a decision from the Supreme Court, but more importantly, it is a consequence of the countless small acts of courage of millions of people across decades who stood up, who came out, talked to parents, parents who loved their children no matter what, folks who were willing to endure bullying and taunts, and stayed strong, and came to believe in themselves and who they were and slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.  
What an extraordinary achievement, but what a vindication of the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things; what a reminder of what Bobby Kennedy once said about how small actions can be like pebbles being thrown into a still lake, and ripples of hope cascade outwards and change the world.  
Those countless, often anonymous heroes, they deserve our thanks. They should be very proud.   America should be very proud.  
  
Thank you.

personalfinance,How to approach a Student Loan refinance in my situation? (Private + Public vs Private consolidation),"**TL:DR's: Refinance public + private or just my private loans? Is lowering credit card utilization for 3 months before actually applying a useful idea? Does consolidating private loans and deferring federal loans temporarily make monetary sense?**

I finally got a pay raise that raises my debt-to-income ratio to a tolerable level for most student loan refinancing/consolidation companies. As such, I have a choice to make in my situation.

First off, my stats:

Income: $50,000/yr (should rise or be supplemented by side business)

Public Loans: $25,369.41 (3.5K at 5.8%, the rest at 6.8%

Private Loans:  $47,341.43 broken out like so:

* $8,722.43	4.75%
* $8,703.54	7%
* $17,962.76	5.30%
* $11,952.70	6%

All rates are variable 

I have no other debt, just a credit card paid off monthly. My score is somewhere in the mid-700's, and I'll probably take it easy on the credit card for a few months before actually applying for the refinance in order to lower my utilization (Side note: How long do companies look back at utilization? I believe I've seen on some mortgage advice sites that it's recommended to lower utilization for 3 months before applying. Is that correct/useful?)

Anyways: I received a pre-approval from SoFi that would allow me to consolidate just my private loans at 4.565% or 4.940% (whether I take a 10 year or 15 year variable loan, respectively.). 

I also received a pre-approval for my private AND public loans at 4.940% or 4.815% (15 or 20 year, respectively).

My question then is - is it worth it to attempt to consolidate all my loans under the 20-year 4.815% plan from SoFi, if I were to actually get that rate? Or, would the benefits of the public loans outweigh the rate reduction? What would you do in this situation? I'm DEFINITELY going to be shooting for the private loan consolidation, probably going to take the 10 year plan - the additional $100 in monthly payments is easily affordable for me.

Side note: I've also considered the idea of consolidating my private, and putting the public loans on deferment and throwing 100% of extra cash to the private loan. Can't really figure out how to do the math to see if this would make monetary sense, can any body help me here?",finance,1435407458

politics,"Could millions of Americans lose their public sector jobs and the US lose our minimum wage laws to WTO action, before TPP is even finalized?","WTO GATS negotiations began in the 1990s and have already caused a lot of big big problems for our country and the world. The last talks fell apart due to much deserved controversies. It seems to me that the main function of TPA is to restart the stalled WTO negotiations, in fact, it even states as much. WTO is job #1. Not TPP. Finishing the WTO Doha Round. 

The main goal of GATS is to ""liberalise"" meaning deregulate the global services trade. ""with a view to ensuring that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services"". Additionally GATS has many disciplines for domestic regulations. They must be ""no more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service"". That seems to be an extremely stringent legal standard that a great many hard earned labor laws and standards are likely to fail. If so they wil be deemed technical barriers to trade in services if challenged by a foreign firm that feels that they have excluded them and their workers in violation of the US pushed trade agreement. 

One of the reasons the previous DOHA round collapsed is the US had a lot of demands and did not have the jobs on the table that a number of developing countries wanted in trade - since they were being asked to give up important things. 

There are **""four modes of supply""** in the GATS and they are split out in the services schedules. So, its possible, as far as I can see, to  trade jobs (Mode Four concessions) for other concessions (for example, those in Mode Three)

Special statuses exist which cotries can extend to others, such as ""National Treatment"" and ""Most Favored Nation"". They give companies the ability to operate in another countries under not just exactly the same set of regulations as they would be subjected to if they were a native company - they actually have more extensive privileges because various barriers which might functionally exclude them must be eliminated. For example, it quite possibly might eb deemed ""more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service"" to have minimum wage laws because after all, people make a free choice to be employed by an employer or not. If the wage the company usually pays their highly skilled workers is less than a national minimum wage, it might be deemed more burdensome than necessary to require them to pay more when they are working in some countries but not others. Additionally, there may well be no women in their country who are qualified to work as engineers, so a requirement that they not discriminate against women, or even have any women in the workplace (they may be against women leaving the home and hearth)  would be deemed more burdensome than necessary. Anyway, I am not an expert on these things at all, I am simply explaining that this new system is so radically unlike the system we have today, and so extremely burdened with radical free trade ideology - unfortunately, the US and EU have over the last 30 years or so made up and then used this other ideology to assist them in what they did and nobody is going to have any sympathy for Americans who claim they didn't know what our country was doing, since, after all we all have become rich from it,


So, expect the WTO GATS negotiations to be restarted soon and the stakes I suspect will be extremely high for American workers.

Its not unlikely that the jobs of millions of public sector workers will be literally poker chips in this global game.
One fact that the EU media coverage (there was almost none in the US) of the Doha Round negotiations glossed over is that negotiations hung up in no small part because other countries did not want to privatize their essential public services without much more from the developed countries.  

One of the main things a number of key countries (like India) especially wanted was more **""Mode Four""** concessions. 


Mode Four is defined as **""Temporary Movement of Natural Persons""**.

A great many of these jobs being put into play are likely to be jobs in the public sector and quasi public sector such as education (teaching) and health care (nursing and medicine) 

The contracts to do those jobs, to manage and staff those former public sector workplaces will likely be put up for bidding in a new e-bidding system that is part of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. In order to make this possible, a great many licensing requirements are required to be handled in the least trade restrictive way possible 

O
One legal standard used is likely to be **""no more burdensome than necessary to insure the quality of the service""**. 


US NGOs or web sites ahave virtualy no information and the little there is is focused on a relatively low volume areas.

 Never underestimate the power of large amounts of money to influence people,

But, consider this, we could soon have skilled professionals working for wages which are below the $15 minimum wage many are fighting for. 

That raises another issue - **In the past, (This happened to El Salvador) when a raise in the minimum wage was executed by a country when trade negotiations with the probability of liberalizing cross border trade in services were anticipated, I am pretty sure that the WTO has deemed them to have been a barrier to market entry. In other words, undertaken with the express intention of excluding firms and their workers who would be entitled to do the work by virtue of their competitive advantage, low wages.**  Existing and pending trade agreements require a great many federal/sub-federal/municipal/local laws be ***""no more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service""***  Nothing seems to be said about wages in a positive sense. Its not a goal of WTO policy to raise wages - it is sometimes a goal of WTO policy to lower them (if they can be framed as being a barrier to trade)  This is what we are getting into. All of the goals which we have mean squat in this other value system, the only discrimination it recognizes is discrimination against corporations. For example, African countries or corporations may get a lot more slack when it comes to their policies (for example, they may be allowed to keep some public services or wage or price controls) while the rich developed countries and corporations would be deemed having developed sufficiently to not have them at all. In this setting, we should expect to see lots of changes like African staffing firms (which were completely staffed by skilled Africans, not African Americans) might replace companies owned by African Americans as being the new contractors in a given contract, because they tendered a lower bid in the international WTO Government Procurement Agreement e-bidding system. 

Visas- In the US, there are existing trade related visas. These are not H1B visas, they are other visas. **""Necessity tests""**-

The test for what is privatized is in GATS I:3 and info on possible necessity tests is in GATS I:4

 Both the existing GATS and the pending TISA have these kinds of **""Mode Four""** provisions. 

This will likely happen unless there is a massive increase in awareness of this issue. 

Please don't underestimate the motivating power of greed. Politicians are frequently awarded high paying, low show jobs lobbying the industries they used to regulate or in various think tanks shortly after leaving office. 

As far as I can tell there is no minimum wage or requirement for wage parity or prevailing wages. 

I.e. not a H1B situation. Not confined to one or two service sectors, ultimately, as the goal of TISA is to cover all service sectors and modes of supply (and to be merged with GATS)",finance,1435425048

I'm a college student starting senior year at a state college studying Accounting and Finance. I have an EFC of $0 because I am considered independent due to my military status in the Air National Guard. As such I will qualify for grants on top of my military aid and scholarships which means that my tuition and books will be paid for.  At the same time **I will be eligible to take out a subsidized loan of $5,500 max. If I have read everything correctly the loan accrues no interest until 6 months after I graduate. There is a 1.05% loan fee. After the grace period the interest rate is like 4.5% or something.**  
I also am currently in a summer internship with a US agency that has a relatively high likelihood of a job offer when I graduate. If I were to enter into a job with them after I graduate I would be eligible for their student loan repayment program after 6 months of working there and they repay up to 10K if I sign a 3 year contract. Their entry level salary is around 60K pre tax. I have about 20K split up between a personal investing account (18K) and a TSP/RothTSP (2K).

EDIT: Current Pros 

* The way I look at it that $5,500 loan will be the cheapest rate I'll ever get. I can invest it in the market and make a nice chunk of change
* If I choose to go to that job I can uses their SLRP to pay the loan and I get a free bonus
* Taking then paying off that loan (might?) boost my credit score?  

Current Cons 

* I don't like debt
* If I invest and the market tanks I could loose money and still end up owing
* A year and a half is a relatively short investment horizon
* I may not go with the agency job if I find something else I like taking the SLRP program out of the picture
* SLRP program at agency could get cut out of their budget (not too likely)

personalfinance,"Got into car crash earlier this week, car is most likely totaled. I was not at fault. Need a car ASAP as to maintain work. Have ~$1000 in savings, look into buying a used car.. Advice appreciated!","Hi,

So this Tuesday I was involved in an accident where a driver pulled out in front of me trying to make a U-Turn. The accident was unavoidable. I'm a bit worried about what the insurance companies are going to say about fault. I know 100% that the other driver was at fault. But I over heard him speaking to an officer on scene trying to push blame onto me, and I'm just not sure exactly how much effect that'll have on the end result. 

A little back story on the accident. I was in the lefthand lane on a 2 lane road (or 4 lane total, not sure the terminology) I was going about the 40-45 miles an hour. Bear in mind that there were no posted speed limit signs on the stretch of road. Leading up to where the accident happened there was an slight curve in the road going down an incline. Not a steep incline, but enough of one to notice. Neither the hill nor the curve effect visibility of the road that the other driver came from. The other driver's road merges with my road on the right hand side, but has either a yield or a stop sign (can't remember which, sorry) as my road is the main road. The other driver apparently did not see me, or misjudged how far away I was. He pulled out into the righthand lane of my road and immediately began to make a u-turn around the median that was about 15 feet away from his street's mergence with mine. So essentially what happened was this guy made a u-turn across two lanes of traffic directly in front of me. I did not see the guy at the intersection at any time, all I saw was him driving directly into my lane from the righthand lane, forcing me to slam on brakes and inevitably hit him. He also did not have a turn signal on. Of course the cops came, everyone was okay both cars had to be towed from the scene. The police turned the matter over to the insurance companies, as typical to any accident. 

I've spoken to and given statements to both my, and his insurance companies. I haven't heard anything back from either about the status of the claim. 

Regardless what happens with the claim, I no longer have vehicle to get back and forth to work with. Public transportation is not an option for my particular situation. I'm likely going to have to call out of work for much of this week until I can get something figured out. What can I do about this? Will insurance pay for a rental car in the interim? If not, will his insurance compensate me in some way for lost wages if he's deemed responsible? How long can I expect this process to get drug out? 

Outside of just the accident, I now have to purchase another vehicle. The car that got wrecked was a 1999 Honda Accord, had ~239,000 miles on it and me and my father have done a laundry list of maintenance and repairs on it the past 12 months;

-Rebuilt Transmission
-Replaced brakepads, &amp; turned rotors
-All tires have been replaced in past 12 months
-New battery purchased (last week no less! grr)
-Regular maintenance; oil, filter, etc. 

I'm not sure if these repairs effect the value of the car to the insurance company. But that car was mechanically sound before the accident, and would have easily went another 100,000 miles. 

The blue book value of the car is ~$2,000

That being said I now have to figure out a way to finance another vehicle. Since my previous car lasted me from Senior Year in High School (2009) until this past Tuesday (6/23/15). I'm not interested in getting another ""beater"" car. If I'm going to spend 5 years making payments on a vehicle I'd like it to have plenty of life left in it after I've got it paid off. Like my dad always says, buy nice or buy twice!

My main concerns are that I don't have very much credit built up. I have renter's history, phone bills, car insurance, etc. But no big ticket items (I've been avoiding taking out a loan like the plague). How will this affect what type of loan/interest rate that I'm able to get? I belong to a credit union, my Grandfather was on the board of Directors for 30+ years. But I don't know how much clout that'd hold when applying for a loan. I haven't spoken to anyone at the bank, but just looking online it seems like the best rate I can hope to get on a 5 year lease is ~3.5%. Is that good for someone in my situation? Or should I start looking elsewhere? If so where is a good jumping off point? 

The other concern is the down payment. I can probably scrape together ~$1000 right this moment, but of course if the insurance company pays for my totaled car I could always add that.. Would it be better for me to try and get a rental car, and wait out the claim? Or would it all wash out if I went and got a car, put $1000 down. Then if I get a check from the insurance company just put that towards the car? 

Sorry I know that this is a lot of information. I've never been in a situation like this, and I'm clueless as to what my next move should be. Any help reddit can offer me is very much appreciated.

personalfinance,Over $100k student loan debt (Federal and Private). Is debt consolidation or refinancing the better route?,"*Background:* &amp;nbsp;

 I was very fortunate to finish school with no debt and my wife has over $100k in student loans. Many of them were deferred and also sold since she started school in 2005.  I have gone into a panic after seeing the amount owed as it's been out of sight/out of mind for awhile and is coming into the light as of the past 2 months.



    
*The loans:&amp;nbsp;*

**-2 Navient loans with 10% interest that are each around $35k.** &amp;nbsp;

**-1 AES loan (which used to be Chase) with 7.7% that is around $20k** &amp;nbsp;

**-1 Wells Fargo with 6.25% that is around $20k** &amp;nbsp;

**-Nelnet/Dept of Education loans averaging between $2k-$5K.** &amp;nbsp;


*Our info:* 

Our combined income is about $120k a year. At the moment the smaller loans are being paid off as a lump that is then distributed to each one individually. So the total to each loan is not very high.
 
*Other info:*

I talked to a trusted family financial adviser and she said that she thinks the best route is a full on debt consolidation. She said that she aided someone using United Debt Services and they brought down her payment by $40k. After this conservation we spoke with a lender that steered us away from consolidation. He stated that as a lender, the consolidation will show up on our record and could be viewed negatively.

The way I see this is that with those high interest rates I don't think this is something that is achievable without some action. My thoughts are this: &amp;nbsp;

**-Refinance Federal and Private loans separately** I have read that refinancing your private loans through a lender can vary depending on your credit. My credit is in the 700's while my wife is below 600. This worries me as it doesn't sound good if we were to choose that route. I also saw information about Income Based Repayment but had trouble fully understanding how that works. &amp;nbsp;

**-Consolidate as many of them as we can** through someone like United Debt Services. &amp;nbsp;

I would sincerely appreciate any advice, links, strategies, or anything else to start figuring this all out. If there's any info that I've missed that is important please let me know. Thank you all very much!",finance,1435436315

The thing is though that in order to go to college i will need an apartment, food, etc... and both of my parents (they are divorced) are refusing to pay a single dime after that tuition.

* Salary: ~$125k

* Mortgage: ~$225k balance on $250k loan, current mkt value is $275k. Paying PMI for at least one more year (FHA regs)

* $401k: investing 5% Roth and 10% traditional (happy with these numbers).

* Cash: $25k

* extra $5k in market (mix of stocks and bonds).

Goal: 

* I want to buy a house at $500k with enough down to avoid PMI. Timeline 2-3 years.

* Ultimately, I would like to keep the other house as a rental since I bought at a good time (lower price, historically low interest rates).

Strategy:

* Is it always worth selling house 1 to roll to a down payment on new house? Example, if I am 20k shy of paying down enough on the new place, do I definitely sell? Or just pay PMI for a bit and keep it?

* Cash is sitting in a 1% yield savings account. Since I want access to this in the near term, I am a bit sheepish on putting it into the market. What is my play here (and with future cash savings)?

I think I could rent it for about $7-8000, which means potentially losing $1000-2000 per month.

This does not create any particular cash flow problems for me per say, but it feels strange to have a cash flow negative asset.

personalfinance,Want to save for a potential down payment for a house - 100% bonds or saving account at 1%?,"Hello,
More /r/personalfinance than /r/investing, I suppose.
I am living in the Bay Area, and housing price is horrendous here (renting or buying).

It seems that if I stay in the same house for at least 3-5 years, I can justify buying a house. I don't think the house market here is going to continue up, it might just slow down, but I suppose, the sooner I can settle instead of renting the better. Hopefully, it is not going to drop - My biggest fear.

I am looking at putting aside the 20+% down payment, so I can buy in 6-18 months. Given the Bay Area's price, the down payment is a *ridiculous* amount of money. This is going to tie a lot of my resources in one single asset.

I have some money in Betterment, with 40/60 (bonds/stocks) and some of my emergency money with 60/40.

40/60 and even 60/40 is probably too risky to park the money for up to 18 months, what about 100/0 (all bonds)? Losing a couple of % should be fine. But I see some years returning -10% for T-Bill 10 years, and with the fed potentially increasing the interest rate, that makes me a bit nervous.

I guess I could invest in short term bonds. BSJI for example is interesting on paper (Junk Bonds with 2018 maturity), but it dropped the past year, and the 4.5% dividends make it barely break even. So not really a good option.

The other possibility is to put the down payment on a saving account like Ally. That's a sure 1%.
5 Years CDs push it to a bit over 2%, not so hot. Worse, with the usually 6 months penalty, I might not even earn anything if I but something before 2016. I could also be in a situation where I don't buy a house because the market is still too hot, even in winter, and I don't want to overbid. So I don't want to be too conservative either.

Is there anything else I am missing? Is there a sweet spot?

CryptoCurrency,Geometric Median of Certainty: How Increased Uncertainty Increases Certainty,"In the spirit of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/3anv84/lets_make_this_subreddit_great_again_get_active/), I hope to do my part with my first post.

The Ideal Reserve's Clotho-Hydra algorithm is responsible for producing consensus.

The time for all performant Clearinghouses on the planet to [totally reconcile](https://www.reddit.com/r/IdealReserve/comments/2vfq5r/definitions/) a transfer is about 500ms due almost exclusively to the speed of light, that the time consumed by data circumtransmitting the globe is approximately 320ms, and the time for errant Clearinghouses to be corrected costs approximately 180ms.

That is the time for one transfer; however, if two transfers originate on opposite ends of the planet at the same time, the per transfer total reconciliation time drops to 250ms.

When the network is at rest, there is total certainty, but the moment a transfer is produced, certainty is greatest at the Clearinghouse closest to the point of where the transfer was produced and least at the Clearinghouse farthest.

If there were no time cost to producing consensus, certainty would be uniform so no need for geographic dispersion thus Clearinghouse competition.  Since there is only one set of data upon which the entire planet must come to agreement, and the time to transfer it costs, certainty will always vary geographically when the network is not at rest, highest where the correct books are and lowest where the errant or simply late Clearinghouses are.

When two transfers are produced at the same time at opposite ends of the planet, certainty is flipped on its head: the points where the two transfers originate are now the least certain, and the points midway between them are the most certain.

Once the books containing the newly cleared transfers reach the midpoints, the Clotho-Hydra algorithms inside the Clearinghouses at the midpoints will reconcile one and ""steal"" the transfer from the other, creating its own book on top of the reconciled one.

At this point, certainty is emanating from a Clearinghouse at the midpoints.  It is already building consensus before the opposite ends are aware that each others' books even exist.  Almost immediately after the opposite ends become aware of each others' books, they become flooded with the consensus already built everywhere else on the planet.

That is how a situation that on first glance would appear to increase uncertainty actually increases marginal certainty.

Finding where the Geometric Median of Certainty is at any time would be computationally expensive.  Certainty is achieved so quickly because of the decentralized way that each Clearinghouse identically measures certainty based upon available information fed to the Clotho-Hydra.  Short-lived forks are continual, and branch switching is necessary.

Decentralized certainty production is the future of clearing &amp; settling because it can in fact be done with less time &amp; resources consumed, higher security, and no error unlike the conventional centralized alternative.

With my new budget, I can put 600 a month towards my credit card debt (in addition to the minimum). I've been doing this the last ~2 months, so I know I can stay on this budget for the forseeable future.

Here's my high-interest debt:

Type |Amount | Interest|
----------|----------|----------|
CC1 | $6500 | 21%
CC2 | $4300 | 16%
CC3 | $500 | 15%

I'm getting slaughtered by the interest rate on the 21% card. My minimum payment is 180, and the monthly interest that gets added is a little over 100.

I have a pre-approved offer from my bank for a 0% APR for 24 months card with a balance transfer, and I'm seriously considering it. I don't know how much I will be approved for, but this seems like a great option to get rid of some or all of the monthly interest.

So my question: Is a transfer to a 0% card a good idea, or is there a better option?
Also, I receive many offers in the mail for this type of credit card. If the card from my bank doesn't cover all the debt, would it be a bad idea to pursue one of these other offers in addition to the bank's?",finance,1435472510

I don't pay for rent but I help out around the house and get groceries and such whenever I can.  Already paid off all my school loans after dropping out twice.

Only traditional debt I have is a new auto loan (Oct '14) that's at 37k (originally 45k) with a monthly payment of 680.  I have two credit cards: one at 0/4k (balance/limit) that I pay after every transaction and the other at 6.5k/41k that I also pay after every transaction now (and pay an extra 700 a month to get it down to 0 eventually).

Insurance and all that good stuff is through my employer.  My take-home is ~2.7k every 2 weeks (so ~5.4 per month).  Now that most of my debt is gone and I'm passed my ""frivolous spending"" phase and paid off all my debt from a failed startup when I was younger, I'd like to tighten things up further in order to buy a nice place ~30 minutes away from the city and near the mountains (houses that I generally like in the areas are anywhere from 400-600k).  Without breaking it down into too much detail since I don't really spend that much anyway anymore (gym paid for by employer, exercise supplements ~100, gas at ~350, food at ~350, dog stuff or random impulse small buys on Amazon) I probably spend ~1k a month.

So rough math: 5.4k - 1k (spending) - 700 (rounded auto loan) - 700 (card payment) - 300 (helping out around the house) = 2.7k.

Also should note that I fucked up my 2013 taxes (was my first time doing it myself) and left out ~6k worth of income, which resulted in my finding out a week ago I owe ~3k to the IRS.  I'm not too worried about it since I have some company RSUs that vest in a week that I can cash out (and I won't make the same mistake of not reporting it on this year's taxes) and equates to just about ~3k.  So while it was an unfortunate fuck up on my part I am fortunate enough that those RSUs are vesting in time to balance things out.

I have ~10k liquid in the bank currently.  I could throw it right at the card and obliterate it easily but I'm only paying ~75 a month in interest that will continue to go down as I get the card to a balance of 0 so I figure it doesn't hurt to keep it a slow process and have a low card utilization rate ~15%.  It's a little motivating to see a balance of at least 5 digits in my bank account, too, especially if it is to grow and eventually be used for a down payment on a mortgage.  The last time I checked my credit score was in the low 700s.  Two credit cards I defaulted on a long time ago should be off my record by now.  I bank with Navy Federal and they have really great 100% financing and 5/5 ARM rates, no PMI, and down payment not required (of course recommended).

I could cut maybe ~200 on some of my spending habits if I really needed to crunch them.  Overall, what's the best way toward approaching the mortgage-hunting and house-buying experience as a first-timer?  Should I save up for a ~10% down payment?  20% (would take longer)?

Even if I went, and somehow got approved, with no down payment or 5%, a house in the extreme ~600k range at 2.25% interest and down payment of ~30k (~5%; if I went with a 3/5 Jumbo ARM from Navy Federal) would be ~2,275 a month (tack on another ~400 in utilities -- guesstimate) and one paycheck at my current salary not the tentative one; that ends up being less than 30% of my gross monthly income.",finance,1435484967

Insurance and all that good stuff is through my employer.  My take-home is ~2.7k every 2 weeks (so ~5.4 per month).  Now that most of my debt is gone and I'm passed my ""frivolous spending"" phase and paid off all my debt from a failed startup when I was younger, I'd like to tighten things up further in order to buy a nice place ~30 minutes away from the city and near the mountains (houses that I generally like in the areas are anywhere from 400-600k).  Without breaking it down into too much detail since I don't really spend that much anyway anymore (gym paid for by employer, exercise supplements ~100, gas at ~350, food at ~350, dog stuff or random impulse small buys on Amazon) I probably spend ~1k a month.

So rough math: 5.4k - 1k (spending) - 700 (rounded auto loan) - 700 (card payment) - 300 (helping out around the house) = 2.7k.

Also should note that I fucked up my 2013 taxes (was my first time doing it myself) and left out ~6k worth of income, which resulted in my finding out a week ago I owe ~3k to the IRS.  I'm not too worried about it since I have some company RSUs that vest in a week that I can cash out (and I won't make the same mistake of not reporting it on this year's taxes) and equates to just about ~3k.  So while it was an unfortunate fuck up on my part I am fortunate enough that those RSUs are vesting in time to balance things out.

I have ~10k liquid in the bank currently.  I could throw it right at the card and obliterate it easily but I'm only paying ~75 a month in interest that will continue to go down as I get the card to a balance of 0 so I figure it doesn't hurt to keep it a slow process and have a low card utilization rate ~15%.  It's a little motivating to see a balance of at least 5 digits in my bank account, too, especially if it is to grow and eventually be used for a down payment on a mortgage.  The last time I checked my credit score was in the low 700s.  Two credit cards I defaulted on a long time ago should be off my record by now.  I bank with Navy Federal and they have really great 100% financing and 5/5 ARM rates, no PMI, and down payment not required (of course recommended).

I could cut maybe ~200 on some of my spending habits if I really needed to crunch them.  Overall, what's the best way toward approaching the mortgage-hunting and house-buying experience as a first-timer?  Should I save up for a ~10% down payment?  20% (would take longer)?

Even if I went, and somehow got approved, with no down payment or 5%, a house in the extreme ~600k range at 2.25% interest and down payment of ~30k (~5%; if I went with a 3/5 Jumbo ARM from Navy Federal) would be ~2,275 a month (tack on another ~400 in utilities -- guesstimate) and one paycheck at my current salary not the tentative one; that ends up being less than 30% of my gross monthly income.",finance,1435485668

I am currently 24 years old, working in a restaurant at $16/hr.  I am allowed to make OT but for the sake of this post, my average income is about $1100 every two weeks.

In terms of my student loans, I have one private Wells Fargo Loan that has two loans at about $45,000.  One $20k with a 9.79% interest rate with automatic payment of $250 a month.  The other with a $25k with 7.8% that I don't set up for.

I also have another Federal Loan that is $25,000 while making a minimum monthly payment of $300.

As for my work, I spend roughly $500 via gas and other car payments.  

I do not pay rent as I still live with my parents though I am looking to move out (This is not as big as a priority as trying to finish off my student loans.)

I would also like to start a savings though I have no idea how to do it.   Marriage is something I would like to do within the next year and a half but I have very little saved up for that.

In terms of credit cards, I only have one debit card and one credit card I recently got but I am good on paying off the credit card.  When I cash my check, I ask them to pay off the credit card with my check, and cash the rest of it in into my checking account.

In addition to all this, I pay about $70 a month for membership to the gym and Netflix.  I do go out a lot though this is something I am going to cut down on because I am reaching that point in my life where I have to take my finance more seriously.  

I dont know what other information is pertinent but I am having trouble managing my money and debt and would like to know what my options are.

I understand the risks of doing this and the fairly weak legal protection (i'm a lawyer and will paper this as best possible to be fair and protect me).

Facts:

* Girlfriend has ~$18k of student loan debt at a pretty high interest rate (~8%) which I want to help her get paid off pretty quickly (within ~1 year);

* I make more than enough money to be able to pay it off;

* She makes ~$40k/year;

* We're not married but we live together, share expenses and bills, etc.

The three ways I can see of doing this are either:

a) I just make a direct payment to her loan account to pay them off;

b) I make a payment to her, she uses the money to pay the loans off;

c) I just pay for all of her expenses for the next 6-7 months and she uses 100% of her after-tax income to pay the loan off really quickly.

investing,What investment options do you think are the best from the list and why?? Are you doing any of these?,"http://smartdiscountshop.com/?p=2644

Individual Stock:  Considered a risky investment because you can technically lose all of your money invested in a particular stock.  Proper timing is important to generate the highest profits.  It’s best to diversify your stocks based on asset classes, geographies, sectors, and market cap.  The price of a stock is based on many factors such as earnings, interest rates, political events, hype, news about the company, and more.  The stock market is too volatile for investors not to diversify their portfolio.  Always have cash on hand for buying opportunities or to repurchase shares at a lower price.  Most investors have a stop-loss order to limit the amount of loss for a particular security.  It can be used for long or short-term trading positions to decrease the amount of emotional trades.

Bonds:  Most portfolios consist of stocks and bonds.  Bonds are purchased for a steady income stream.  The interest payments are fixed twice a year with principal and the longer the term of the bond, the higher the risk.  Bonds are not protected by inflation but are considered less risky than stocks.  They are IOUs from municipal entities, corporations, and U.S. government.  Borrowers with good credit will pay less interest for their bonds.  Bonds should be purchased when there is deflation because it increases the value of dollars paid to bond holders.

CD’s:  CD’s are a certificate of deposit that has a maturity date, interest rate, and issued in any denomination.  The risk is extremely low if it’s backed by FDIC.  For CD’s it’s all about what interest you’re locked into because if interest rates go up you are stuck at the lower rate.  Many that sign up for CD’s do it for a year or less.  There are withdrawal penalties for CD’s if you need to close before the maturity date.  Some investors rollover their CD’s which may end up hurting more because if interest rates go down, the CD will get rolled over to the lower rate.  There are variable rate CD’s offered for people worried about interest rates rising.  CD’s provide a combination of income and safety.  Here are high online CD rates for 1-year:  Bank Rate

Precious Metals:  Most people that invest in precious metals purchase gold, silver, and platinum.  Individuals can purchase the actual metal in stores such as gold and silver coins, or purchase precious metal ETF’s.  The paper investment ETF’s are stocks highly correlated with the current value of precious metals.  You don’t physically own the metal.  Precious metals are risky because of high upward and downward price movements that are based on supply and demand.  Investors purchase metals to shield against the effects of inflation.

Mutual Fund:  Mutual funds are considered less risky than purchasing individual stocks because they are investment programs.  The company collects your money along with many other investors to purchase a group of stocks, bonds, and other securities. Investors don’t need large amounts of money to purchase mutual funds and it’s a good way to diversify your portfolio.  Mutual funds are managed by professionals and are more for people that don’t have time to oversee their own investments.  Mutual funds are considered safe for retirement savings plans.

Collectibles:  Collectibles are items that have value and in demand.  It can range anywhere from art, antiques, beanie babies, coins, classic cars, comic books, sports memorabilia, toys, etc.  You need to know what you’re purchasing because a lot of collectibles are worthless.  Unique items tend to be valuable such as old LEGO blocks, old breakfast cereal, classic NES games, old electronics, vintage magazines, old stamps, etc.  Collectibles are tricky because it’s more about what the buyer is willing to spend and how much demand there is for the limited selection of items.  The price of certain collectibles tend to increase when the dollar weakens. 

P2P Lending:  Is an alternative investment that provides a high return for investors.  People can borrow or lend money that is separate from financial institutions.  Lenders provide money to people they do not know called “peers.”  There is incentive to lend because the rate of return is higher than at traditional financial institutions generally between 5%-9%.  Borrowers seeking loans from P2P sites are doing it because they are lacking the credentials from traditional institutions due to high default risk.  The biggest concern for P2P lending sites are the default risk from borrowers.  There are no claims to any assets on personal loans for lenders.  Reputable P2P sites spread your loan across hundreds of loans to offset default risk.  However, P2P sites are lightly regulated that is still considered unproven.  P2P lending has yet to weather a boom or bust cycle.

personalfinance,Tax advice: I just paid over 40% total tax on my first ever large bonus,"I'm 28 and graduated college just over three years ago. I've been very blessed to have had a great start to my career while others have struggled in the recent economy. Last year I received a promotion of sorts that increased my salary and included a performance-based bonus. I just received my first instance of this bonus recently and wasn't terribly surprised about the tax burden, but I need some advice on where to go from here. I'm guessing the best route for me is to find an accountant of some sort, but I do want to continue to try to understand the details of my finances (one reason I'm reluctant to turn to financial planners for advice--I'm skeptical of anyone who works for ""free"" or is otherwise incentivized to sell me things that are in their best interest rather than my own).

My base salary is $120k and my recent bonus was for an additional $40k. I am married and have three children. I bought a house earlier this year and expect to be able to itemize the mortgage interest, PMI (still tax deductible this year, right?), and my charitable contributions (10% tithe and other contributions I have made/will make).

From what I have read, bonus income is taxed differently than normal income. I see the terms ""percentage method"" and ""aggregate method"" as I try to read up on this online. I'm assuming my employer used the aggregate method and that I've potentially overpaid (especially since I haven't updated my W-4 with my employer since after the birth of my first child).  Last year my tax return was around $1000, so I was reluctant to tweak my W-4 with my second child (third was born this year), thinking that the $1000 was less than the tax credit of a child and I'd end up owing taxes (well, I guess you owe them no matter what, but I think most would prefer a small return rather than a small payment).

My bonus was a separate check (not part of my normal pay check).  On the 40k, 7% was diverted into my 401(k) (with some employer matching, which was nice). The remaining $37,200 was taxed as follows: $580 for medicare, $2,480 for social security, $11,939.80 for federal income tax, and $1,860 for state income tax.  The medicare and social security are a flat rate on the pre-401k total, and nothing would shift there, right? But the federal income tax comes to about 32% of the post-401k income.

So my question is: are bonuses really taxed at 25% across the board, as I read regarding the percentage method, or should I consider this income to be similar to my normal salary and act as if I will make $160k this year and then expect to pay taxes as I normally would on that income (subtract pre-tax 401k contributions, and other deductions and then apply the graduated tax percentages to the amount)? I'm going to update my W-4 and wonder if I should just put down me, my wife, and three children, or if I should be claiming extra exemptions if I've already overpaid.

Edit: I should have mentioned that I am the only income source in our family and only expect to bring in the $160k this year.",finance,1435519071

The maximum amount of IRA investment we can contribute is $5500 per year. So let say I make $70k in California with a 9.3% state income tax and 25% federal tax.

* To max out a Roth IRA, I will have to invest $5500*(1+0.093+0.25)=****$7386.5*** in order to inject $5500 into the account. But I will be paying no further tax on both my principal nor the interest earned.
* To max out a Traditional IRA, I just have to put in **$5500.0**, but I will have to pay taxes for both my principal and the interest earned later when I retired/withdraw.

Roth IRA does sound very nice because I can withdraw more money from a tax advantaged account when retired, with the full **$5500.0+interest** instead of **($5500.0+interest)-taxes**.

Here are my financials:

- $70,000/year salary
- $8,000 liquid cash invested into my business (The money isn't being used)  that I could withdraw at any time
- $8,000 emergency fund in savings account

- $9,000 in roth IRA
- $2,500 in IRA
- my daily driver car worth $5,000 (I don't plan on getting rid of this though)

As for debt:

-  no debt except $2,500 credit card debt at 0% interest (if I pay off by Dec. 2015)
- all monthly expenses add up to ~$1,700 (I currently save ~$1,500-$2,000 a month)

I did not get very good grades in high school because I was so focused on sports, so my GPA was probably around a 3.0-3.2. My father did not go to college but does really well with construction and my mother makes decent money as well and has her masters degree. They told me that they would help me out financially after I graduated from college, apparently to give me an incentive to do well instead of helping me out during. While in college I had to take out ALL student loans to pay for tuition, housing, books, food, travel, you name it AND I was able to obtain the loans with the amounts I needed with my grandpa, mother, or dad as the co-signer. Like I said, they make enough money so that co-signing would allow me to be eligible to get the amount of money for college but they did not provide me with anything besides buying groceries a couple times and paying off some of the interest on one of my loans. I was also unable to get any money from FAFSA because my parents made too much money. I applied for scholarships and grants but did not receive any money as I am a plain Jane, white, female that apparently did not stick out enough to get any financial assistance.  Well, I graduated from college with a Doctorate degree in physical therapy but I do not make nearly enough money to pay off 3 years of undergrad and 3 years of graduate school.

Car insurance 360$ every 3 months. My parents got me a car/small SUV as a graduation present. They put down $10,000 but then said I have to pay off the rest and pay for the car insurance. Wouldn't really have wanted a newer car (2013 model) if I would have known I'd be paying for the majority of it.  
This also does not include random expenses such as being in my best friends wedding coming up where my plane ticket expense was 400$, the room was 200$, I had to get a new license when I turned 25 so that was another 33$, so any savings that I do accumulate completely goes out the window following these very frequent random costs.",finance,1435534428
personalfinance,[20M] Is it wise to move out of state? Seeking opinions,"Hey!

I'm a 20 year old college student, studying in the same town I was born and raised in. I recently got back from a year abroad, and realized that I'm going to go insane if I continue to stay here (Southern Minnesota.)

Outside of finding a college that will support my current area of study (physics,) I know that uprooting yourself &amp; transplanting your life somewhere else can be intoxicatingly difficult. My parents have never moved anywhere except down the road a few years ago, and they have little to offer me in terms of counsel.

Suggestions?,"As the title says, my significant other wants to loan from his 401 K,b Fedility plan - which is stock based, currently at 6 grand, for a new motorcycle. He's outgrown the one we bought last year with my workers comp money (I kinda regret having done that, but its in the past) Its also very broken down and not doing him too hot. He's putting more into it then what's worth now. The bike is 3,500 (used but mint condition) 

Please note, this motorcycle is his MAIN use of transportation
 He uses it to commute to work.

Our savings is strictly for a new/1996 new/ car (getting it in a few weeks) so he knows that's off the table. He can ask a family member for a loan but doubt he'll get it. So he's looking to borrow from his 401 K. I hate this idea. I don't want to deal with the penalties. We're week to week paycheck survivors, paying that back may not happen. 

Last note, he plans to find better work, quit and leave this job within the year. The 401 K will be cashed out and used for a few different things. Another new/used car so his motorcycle isn't his main transportation, and since I did buy him the bike with my workers comp we're looking to use some money towards me going to college for phlebotomy courses so I can find better work (its roughly 3,500 where we currently live and I don't like the idea of being federal debt/can't quality for student aid until I'm 24 and officially seen as separated from my parents income, even though I haven't lived with them for 5 years.

I am a 25 y/o living in NYC and make approx 104k per year (28% federal tax bracket) with no debts or student loans. Currently maxed out roth IRA for this year (and last year), contribute 10% to roth 401k (no match), and approx. 6% to work pension plan. Initially, I chose the roth option so I wouldn't have to pay taxes after I retire but I'm thinking I really should switch to the traditional option since I pay so much taxes now and, career-wise, will not reach the 33% tax bracket. Not to mention, I plan on moving to a state with no state income tax following retirement (age 63-65?).

personalfinance,Banking Fraud (AUS),"I am the concerned partner of a longstanding Westpac branch Personal Banker who is being threatened with dismissal due to being under 100% of an annual sales target. 
Their performance is judged on what they call a balanced score card which consists of gate openers for New Revenue 80 % of target, Customer advocacy and Compliance. All these have been met at their last second quarter review however as the revenue target is not at 100% for year to date dismissal is pending.
This has caused enormous stress on my partner and the family as they are the sole income earner and long standing professional.
My partner refuses to take part in any miss-selling to help compete and retain employment. 
I believe the Bank has a dishonest culture of revenue from the customers AT ALL COSTS which is contrary to its banking licence, code of conduct, consumer protection and corporate laws.
Recently changed revenue targets splitting Core (Bank accounts, loans) and Wealth (Insurances, super, Planning) even further ramps up the pressure on staff to consider self-preservation instead of what is in the best interest of customers.  
Also the use of bonus dollar values for periods of time e.g doubling of Home insurance makes staff feel like they are part of a TV game show instead of banking, which would be funny if staff and customers livelihoods were not at stake.
This practice also motivates even more miss-selling by offering big discounts that that are retraced at the first renewal, building in large excesses and influencing customer’s opinions on value of replacement to reduce premiums. Management dishonestly do not disclose other dangers like customers needing to hold existing covers pending the end of waiting periods.  
Line of Credit loans (no set repayments) currently at seven times the official cash rate and Credit Cards at 10 times the cash rate are usually for unidentified purchases and together with insurances are targeted to more vulnerable and unsophisticated customers.
A common practice is either to confirm or implicitly indicate that if the insurance is taken out then the approval maybe more likely.
Zero balance transfers simply set the traps.
Another common practice is either to confirm or implicitly indicate that if the insurance is taken out then the approval maybe more likely.
Zero balance transfers simply set the traps.
The Bank temporarily withdrew bankers from selling Credit Card Protection insurance (CCRP) but is now reinstating this after staff have completed a simple eTraining module and brief role play. 
Interestingly my partner was relieved to have it withdrawn in the first place as the pressure to cross sell was also withdrawn. But now it will be back on. 
Case in point.
 Since the withdraw of BT Super for Life from attracting revenue (but is still part of a share of wallet number) there has been a MASSIVE drop in numbers sold miss-sold) 
Savings accounts opened as part of packages and customers forced to deposit funds immediately as revenue is only allocated on this happening. 
When customers seek any form of discount for say Home Loan interest rates Management will only consider if other products like insurances or a referral to one of our Financial Planners is taken out.
Income protection and trauma cover outside superannuation are called “Quick Wins” by Management as staff are pressured to immediately place customers on the phone to a non-advice seller to get them to take out policies. Only the unsophisticated and young are targeted and influenced to take immediate action. These are a favourite of Area Management practically when revenue for the week is down. 
Customers are advised on how the bank uses their information and that staff may be rewarded bonuses but not that they can be dismissed if a revenue target is not met.
Customers should be provided with the list of revenue items used to calculate these targets for them to decide if the banker is not being influenced by same.
This should be legislated and maybe someday sales targets will be abandoned under pressure from customers. 
The branch displays the gaps in revenue for individual bankers on a large white board and staff are made to report revenue several times a day while non performers are also called out in emails and staff meetings.
The Bank uses a system of full and no advice selling under the guise of FOFA legislation.
This is simply dishonest and is really used to help convince customers of some form of authenticity to support hard and miss-selling.
My partner has been alienated and bullied for questioning this culture and has been told to a winner or get off the train.
All anyone has to do is google banks miss-seeling to see where the train is heading.
Senior management has simply been lazy and dishonest by placing ALL the pressure on staff to sell to build an unstainable retail business instead of developing products and services that are honest, innovative and wanted by customers.
Customers may then be true MYBANK customers (share of wallet) instead of victims.
The company, staff, customers and all Australians deserve better.
Dishonest management will have got off the train with their massive bonuses long before it runs out of line.

personalfinance,How do I calculate when to buy a house?,"My wife and I are just wrapping up school loans (probably finished in August).

MachineLearning,Resource allocation and optimization with ML,"I'm a beginner in the field of ML and I was thinking about the following theoretical problem:

Let's assume we are running a cinema multiplex that has multiple screening rooms. We are showing multiple films at the same time and we want a ML algorithm to come up with a schedule for which screen should show which film and also predict how many ticket/popcorn desks should be open before the show. 

To clarify, the screening rooms have different capacities, pictures have different durations and patrons may behave differently based on which demographic the film targets, etc. 

The algorithm could be fed any kind of data to improve it's predictions, such as IMDB rating, genre of film, reviews, film launches, maybe weather as well as past performance in the real world. Also, the algorithm should be able to learn from operator input (for example the operator would prefer to open screening rooms that are close to each other for easier staffing or close down rooms for refurbishment).

The objective of the algorithm would be to produce a daily schedule for the multiplex, allocating each picture to a room and predicting how long ahead of time should the ticket and popcorn tills be opened in order to ensure that no patrons queue for more than X minutes while also making sure that no staff is sitting idle (multiple tills can be opened at different times).

Do you think this would be a suitable problem for ML? What would be your recommended approach to this problem? I'm thinking about neural networks with some form of evolution. 

The idea is that a sufficiently evolved algorithm would be able to find interesting correlations (let's say for example that certain genres of pictures attract demographics that prefer to pay cash, making the ticket sales a longer process or during winter time patrons arrive earlier at the cinema, etc). 


Note that this is a hypothetical problem (and I know very little about the film business) however I feel that a solution would be applicable to any resource allocation problem where humans are involved (market checkout, festival security lanes and food stands, etc).

personalfinance,I could use some outside-the-box thinking to get out of my car lease.,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point.  Some life changes occurred for the better and I need to break my car lease.

The car: 2015 Mazda 6

Lender: Chase Auto Finance

Terms: 48 month lease / $276 per month

Payoff quote: ~$24,000

Current appraisal: ~$18,500

State: NY

I just got off a call with Chase Auto to explore my options.  Let's just say, it wasn't a favorable conversation.  Their options for me were to either sell the car back to the dealership (went there this weekend, they offered 18,500) or let Chase auction the car off and I pay the difference (not at all an option I'm considering).  No way I'm cutting them a ~$6,000 check to early terminate this lease.

The problem with Chase Auto is they do NOT allow any equity transfers, at least not in NY.  I'm basically handcuffed to this car.  

One option I thought of was to take out an auto loan from my credit union to payoff Chase then sell the car privately, but I really don't think I can fetch more than $22,000 for the car.

So basically, I'm looking at paying the ~$6,000 difference, going the private auto loan route (really don't want a $24,000 loan over my head, God forbid I can't sell the thing), or unregistering the car, canceling the insurance on it, and make the monthly payments while it sits under a cover somewhere.  I honestly don't even know if I can take the insurance off a leased car.

Sorry this was longer than I expected it to be.  Can anyone offer any other solutions for me?

personalfinance,Long time lurker- loan question!,"Hey there /r/personalfinance!

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve been a long-time lurker of this subreddit, initially reading for probably a year before deciding that I make too much money to be broke all the time. I’m not someone making a massive salary, but for a single guy with no kids, I’m making enough that I have some serious guilt knowing I’ve made poor financial decision in the past, and there are people comfortably raising a family on what I’m making. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m looking for some advice on a car loan I took out that I have the opportunity to refinance. Some backstory: I had pretty horrible credit to start all this, so I took what I knew was a bad interest rate because I needed the car &amp; knew I could make the payments. I know this subreddit often advocates against buying a car unless absolutely necessary, let’s not get into that and go with what I have right now:

&amp;nbsp;

6-year loan that I started in November of 2013 with a monthly payment of: $384.61

&amp;nbsp;

Current balance: $13995.65
10-day payoff: $14153.95
20-day payoff: $14222.78

&amp;nbsp;
 
I’ve been making my car payments since November of 2013 with no issues &amp; have also bumped my credit score by quite a bit by paying down my credit card debt and closing out some negative remarks on my credit report.

&amp;nbsp;

In tracking my score on Credit Karma, one of the suggestions was that I refinance to a better loan. I know this is something Credit Karma gets a sort of commission on, but I thought it might be worth looking into since $384.61/month is no small number.

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s what I got back in an email from the new potential lender:

&amp;nbsp;

==========
The details of your refinance pre-approval are below:
– Your Current Rate: 17.97% 
– New Rate: 9.79% 
– Your Current Payment: $384.00* 
– New Payment: $277.54* 
– Term: Determined by you. Available from 24-72 months* 

&amp;nbsp;

* All approvals are subject to certain terms and conditions. Some restrictions apply. The payment amount for your New Loan is based on an estimated balance and will change depending on the exact payoff amount of your Current Loan. Your new monthly payment amount and actual savings over the life of the loan may change depending on the loan term you select. The estimated payment also assumes the purchase of an optional GAP debt waiver product.
==========

&amp;nbsp;

A few extra notes: by July 15th, I will be totally free of credit card debt, so perhaps it’s better that I start making larger payments on my loan to chip away at it more quickly than it would be to refinance? After the 15th, I’ll have the ability to pay ~$800/month to the car loan if I choose to go that route. I am working on building my emergency fund at the same time that I’m paying off my debt, so I wouldn’t want to go any higher than that since it would cut into my ability to save money each month.

I know this is a bit of a mess, but for the past few months I’ve felt more free than ever and it’s incredibly to not have the stress of living paycheck to paycheck, so thanks so much to all the advice I’ve gotten so far from this subreddit.

personalfinance,Need some advice on how to approach my home loan...,"My wife and I are first time home buyers and are getting ready to build a home. We have no debt, 20% to put down on a $265K house, and a base HHI of around $110K. 

We got pre-qualified for a mortgage today, but I found out they determine the interest rate entirely on my wife's credit score (690), and not mine (801). The rate they quoted was 4.375%. 

My question is am I better off taking the mortgage out alone on my income (around $60K base) or sticking with a joint loan with my wife?",finance,1435598634
personalfinance,free 85k car. Is it a good deal for me?,"UPDATE 2: I am thinking of telling him to go ahead but also planning on talking him into a prepaid lease of some kind. That way I will have the option of opting out after 2 or 3 years if I don't like doing this after a while.  It will also give me the use of the car and have him pay for insurance.  I will also try to contract so that he doesnt try to demand all sorts of things that I did not contemplate.

What do you guys think of this option?  Also, what kind of government attention would this draw?





UPDATE 1: I called him up and told him that the insurance costs might be too much to bear. He agreed to cover insurance and possibly get a cheaper car with the following conditions: 1) Must be New Mercedes, 2) Must be V8, 3) He must be able to get in and out with a cane. 

I asked him to clarify who will hold title. He said that he would let me hold title. I asked him why am I benefiting from his generosity.  He said that he is paying over $2000 per month in town car taxi fees and feels that this will justify the car purchase over how long he expects to live.   I also feel, although he didnt come out and say it, that he also wants to buy companionship because he is lonely. He also said that if I didnt mind, he wanted me to help him find a young girlfriend.

I talked about scheduling and he seems to be willing to go along with scheduling. However, I have a feeling he will bitch and hold the car over my head.

I am leaning more towards doing this.  Now my main concern is will I get audited and or visited by the IRS or some other guy in a suit for having such a large car titled in my name.



A nonrelative elderly person recently proposed the following to me.  He is fed up with the cost of cabs and offered to buy me an 85k mercedes if I drive him wherever he wants for the remainder of his life. He cannot drive because he wears a high dose of opium patches.

To get this car I must drive him to Dr. and other medical appointments, the grocery store, pharmacy, etc.  I will pay for gas and insurance and he agrees to pay for maintenance.

My primary concern is if this is a good deal for me financially because of the increase in insurance cost going from a $3000 car to an $85000 car and the increased fuel costs from driving someone around with premium gas as opposed to regular.  

Until August, I am unemployed when I will be making around 30k per year. I have not held any employment since 2012 when I made minimum wage. (I have been in grad school.) I am worried attention will be brought to my name for having such an expensive car in my name and not enough income to justify such a purchase.  It can be easily justified, but I am not sure I want the stress of a jackbooted fed looking into my business with a microscope trying to find something or trying to accuse me of taking advantage of an old man, which I don't think I am because he offered.

personalfinance,"Debt problems, what should I do? Here is my situation","Im a long time lurker, first time poster. I am in a position with my gf where we have a high debt load but no idea how to pay it off. I live in Canada to clear things up.

I currently hold a job that is piece rate work, with a 55K/year salary base, 2 weeks vacation. I am just about finished training and can see myself earning 60-70k per year based on performance, however that is speculation.

My gf just got a new job that pays 75K/year salary + 3 weeks vacation.

We own our house, and owe - $269,000 (Mortgage rate is 3.09%) and our payment per month is $1800 which includes CMHC mortgage insurance, property taxes and we overpay by about $150/month. We have talked to a realtor about selling, and he told us that we could sell it for 335-339k. We bought this property for $294,000 in Sept of 2012.

Vehicles ---
(Myself) I own my car outright and pay $140/month insurance.
(Her) she finances her vehicle and pays $735 for her car payment and insurance. She has 46 payments left of $635 until her vehicle is paid off.

My debts ---
Credit - $14,000 of 20k credit (~19.9% interest) - $280/month interest
Line of Credit - $14,000 of 15k credit (~7.5% interest) - $90/month interest
Student Loans - $14,000 (~8% interest rate) - $350/month payment

Her Debts ---
Line of Credit - $8000
Credit Card - $2000

Savings &amp; RRSPs ---
(Me) - $0 savings, $500 rrsps
(Her) - $2000 savings, $13,000 rrsps

We split everything 50/50 but want to put ourselves into a position that we can work together to pay of our debts as one.

We have been together for almost 7 years, living together for almost 6.

Basically, I just want to figure out our best option. Right now we have enough money to pay our bills but don't have enough to pay down our debts in a reasonable time frame. We spend over $550 a month collectively on interest.

We have thought about selling our house, but the way the market is in our city we would lose out on appreciation in the future. We also want to eventually rent this place out and have it as an investment. Right now we could rent it out for approx $1900/month so that would cover our mortgage, taxes, insurance and still be +$100

My thought would be refinancing our house, refinancing it for around $305k, take that money, pay off my credit line and credit card and pay off her LOC. That would leave us with only $2000 owing on her credit card and put us in a position where we will have a higher mortgage payment and escape us from high consumer credit. 

I just want some opinions, thoughts, other options? Maybe im missing something here and just dont see it

I left college without a degree, and recently started Barber School. My wife is about a year from finishing her PhD and making ~33k/year, then we'll be moving somewhere for a post-doc (where she'll make slightly more, then move again in a few years). I don't have an income right now.

We haven't been able to have a steady budget for the past year. We've had to do a lot of traveling for family things, had family visiting us here, I was sick for around 6 months and incurred some medical bills, basically life hasn't been the average for the past year. I sat down to try and draw up a budget again today, and I just wanted to get some opinions from someone that might now a little better..

Having just started barber school again, I'm looking at how to manage the debt we have. School from start to finish is going to cost ~6500, and I'm making payments of $300 per month directly to the school instead of incurring more debt, there also isn't any interest associated with it. My first thought is to try and get deferment for the student loans, then shift the $250 we would be paying on those to the credit cards, starting with the small/high interest one. 

Am I missing another option for the school loans? I've tried reading up a little on student loans, and it sounds like consolidating them wouldn't really help my situation much since they're already a fairly low interest rate. As far as educational debt goes, I feel like we're better off than most, and it is just the credit card debt killing us right now.

We usually end up only having $100-$200 extra every month, and just put that on the credit cards. We have around $3000 sitting in a savings account that I guess would constitute our emergency fund. Thankfully, my wife's job is all but guaranteed for the next year, and has options lined up for the next few years, so we don't have to worry about any volatility there.

I live in Grand Rapids, MI, where the housing market is doing very well. Rates and prices are still relatively low, and houses go FAST. I could pay off student loans and make some nice-to-have home improvements, but then I probably wouldn't have enough saved for a rental until...2017?

700 monthly income from roommates

27k in savings. I get 3% interest on up to 15k. $5500 of this is actually my dad's money I'm holding while he's in prison (long story), but he has given me permission to effectively use it as my money in the meantime (until 2021 at the earliest).

personalfinance,North Carolina attempting to collect on tax that I don't think I owe them? (X-Post from /r/Tax),"Last year I worked in Virginia from January to August, living there, including submitting a change of address.  It was for an internship.  During this time, I accumulated roughly 27,000 in earnings.

I lived in North Carolina from August to years end for school.

When tax season rolled around, I filed for both states, marking myself as a part-time resident of each.  I used the H&amp;R Block software, which seemed to do everything correctly in my opinion.  Those 27,000 were marked as federal earnings, as well as Virginia.  North Carolina took that amount, subtracted the standard deduction, and multiplied it by some fixed number, .0107 or something, to end up with me owing around $200 in taxes to them.  I paid that to them.  

Yesterday I received a letter in the mail stating that I owe North Carolina 1.1k in taxes - 1.3k from the 27k earnings minus the 200 or so I already paid them.  Am I incorrect in assuming that they have their numbers wrong.  I shouldn't be liable for paying them taxes on that income if I was only a part time resident and earned the money while living in another state, right?

So I screwed up: I paid my old apartment $1,500 outright as well as the other $400 owed to the other apartment complex.

My job doesn't pay well, so ever since my business started booming, I've been taking a paycheck and recently ""gave myself a raise"".  So now I effectively doubled my income, which allows for my family and I to save around 30% of our income.

We used to live check to check, so now I'd like to have some breathing room in our checking account.  I used to be anxious everyday about money, worrying we wouldn't have enough.  Now I worry everyday wondering ""what could happens and what will I do?""

My business is largely cash flow dependant, so it requires a lot of money to make money and I'm constantly worried I'm taking too much and that I'm going to choke it (though the numbers say otherwise).  I'm always wondering ""What will I do once my business dies down?"". It's like no matter how much money I have, I'm worried about not having enough.

My family is warm, fed, and comfortable and that should be enough, but I have this constant anxiety.  I always feel like there's not enough TIME to grow the business and continue at my job and be with my family.  My dream was to work self employed full time, but after extensive research on taxes and health insurance, my dreams are being crushed.  I feel like I'll never get there.

personalfinance,Student thinking about car loan. Could you help me understand the process?,"Hi, I'm currently a 19 year old college student, and I may need to buy a car in the near future. If I do, I'll need to take out a car loan. Here's some basic information about me: 

During the summer, I have a full time (45+ hours a week) and during the school year I'll have a part time job. 

By the time I leave for school I'll have around $1,000 to $1,500 saved up (after paying tuition). 

I checked my credit score on creditkarma.com and both the scores they gave me (transunion and equifax) were at a 740. 

I don't need a nice car, just something reliable. 

So my question is, will I be able to get a car loan/finance a car? If I do what type of interest rate should i expect? Also, how can I make sure I'm not getting ripped off? What will the process be like?

Edit: Also I will be living on campus so I don't have ANY expenses while at school. No rent. No utilities. No food bills (I eat at the dining hall).",finance,1435623262
personalfinance,Credit score lowering due to student loans?,"So, I just noticed my equifax and transunion both dropped 15 points since the last time I checked. Which gave me a slight panic. I quickly went over and checked and realized it's because my ""total accounts"" has increased by two. This is as I'm pulling federal student loans, both subsidized and unsubsidized. It appears for every single loan I pull federally counts as a new account. So Fall 2014 has two accounts (Sub &amp; Unsub), Spring 2015 has two, etc. etc.

Is this what could have caused that significant drop? According to creditkarma I have no derogatory marks, 100% payment history, but the age of credit history is lowering due to the new accounts. Is there any way I can get all these individual loans consolidated to count as a single account?

personalfinance,Need an outside/non-familial opinion: Is getting LASIK surgery at 23 a stupid decision?,"I'm 23 and work full-time making roughly $30,000 in my field plus money from the National Guard (roughly $200 a month and ~$2000 a year extra). I have no debt at all. My monthly expenses are roughly $800.

I have been interested in getting LASIK surgery for a while now; from what I know, it would be roughly $5000 if my insurance does not kick in for any of it (which it probably won't, but it's a really good plan sooo maybe?). As of right now, I have $6,000 saved up in my checking/savings account, with another $1,000 stashed in another account, and I don't know how much in my 401k. Obviously I'm not getting the surgery for at least another couple of months, so I expect to have more money saved up by then. I do not plan on completely wiping out my savings.

My family is doing everything in their power to dissuade me, stating I should save up for something like a car.

I really want to get the surgery while I'm still young and can reap the benefits (especially while I'm still in the military--having glasses in the military can get annoying). I'm just worried I'm missing the big picture because of my relative lack of financial experience. Am I making a stupid decision?

EDIT: Probably should mention the doctor I'm seeing is married to a doctor I work for, and is willing to give me a discount on the procedure/office visits once I get them set up. Though I don't know how much the discount will be.

double edit: Thanks for all the replies! The consensus seems to be to wait until at least 25 because of developing eyes. I should mention one of the reasons I want to do it now is because I'm on BCBS Federal with my parents, and once I turn 26 I'll probably have to get Obamacare. But, I plan on going in for a consultation and seeing how much the expected cost will be and what the doctor's advice is...but I think I will end up waiting until I'm 25 and get it before I get off my parent's insurance.

The truck is in great shape mechanically and I fully expect it to last me another 6-8 years. My question is whether it makes more sense to repair the car or pay the loan.

I was given a check from the insurance company for $6,700 and my payoff is $9,370 with a 3.99% interest rate. My monthly payment is $170 and through a work bonus program I am able to comfortably pay double each month. 

Our emergency fund is 10k and I would have to dip into this fund to pay off the rest of the loan. That would be approximately $2,700 from our EF. After paying the loan, I would probably drop comprehensive from my insurance and all in would save $200+ each month. This would mean leaving the truck as is and not repairing the hail. I've driven a hail car for years so that wouldn't bother me. 

Would using this to pay off the loan outweigh the benefits of fixing the vehicle? Granted the vehicle would take a huge hit in value, but it would be paid off. Would there be any unforseen consequences with my insurance if i don't get the truck fixed? Thanks!",finance,1435639676

investing,5 Tips For Landlords,"Everyone knows that property is one of the most popular forms of investment. Unlike shares, bonds, trusts etc. property has an extra safety-net in that people will always need somewhere to live. That said, this by no means guarantees that any property investment is a good one. House prices fluctuate, as do the rental returns – not to mention the fact that mortgage interest rates are also variable.
All things considered, property remains high on the list of possible investments for many and perhaps one of the biggest factors in making the investment a success is – THE TENANTS! Here are five tips for potential buy to let property investors:
 
Always Use a Contract
When you are first setting out in the property investment world, it can be tempting to cut corners to save a few pounds. Furthermore, you may already have possible tenants in mind; friends, family or even work colleagues. I previously lived with another couple back at University in my friends house and things actually got pretty ugly when it was time to leave. The other couple had informally agreed to live there for 6 months and wanted to leave after 4. There was no contract in place between ‘friends’ and as a consequence the friendship was no more – Don’t mix business with pleasure if possible.
Others will try and wrangle their way out of contracts on technicalities. In the UK a number of ‘standard’ contracts exist, so you won’t have to pay a lawyer to write one from scratch and solicitor’s rates can actually be pretty reasonable. If you want to save more money, you can actually download one of the tenancy agreements online and edit it yourself – although it might be an idea to have a lawyer check it over.
 
Get the Mortgage Overpayments Right
When you are investing in property, it can be tempting to get too carried away with the numbers. While paying of your mortgage(s) early is a great idea in principle, ensure that you don’t set yourself up for a fall. Reduced term mortgaged (15 years instead of 25 years for example) are very popular, but can also get you into deep water if the interest rates rise or your property goes through a period of being empty. Check with your mortgage provider, but you can often make overpayments within a given limit (usually 10% of the balance) without paying a penalty. This way, you can take a 25 year mortgage and overpay as and when you can afford to – you are not obligated to meet the higher monthly repayments.
 
Have a Contingency Fund
Unlike with stock and shares, an investment in property often requires ‘topping up’ to ensure that it continues to provide a sizable return. Curtains, carpets, walls, furniture, gardens etc. all need repairing and fixing at some point. Many landlords will charge tenants from their security deposit if they are directly responsible for the breakage of something, but soft furnishings all get tired with time. It might be a good idea to keep a ‘spares and repairs account‘ for the unexpected replacement of an appliance or to help you pay the mortgage if there is a gap between tenants.
 
Use an Agency or Do It Yourself?
The temptation when buying property as an investment is to think that you can manage it all by yourself. As your empire starts to grow, the demand on your time will also increase. Agencies charge a small fee, but can take care of many of the tedious tracks in the process. You don’t want a criminal or somebody who was evicted for trashing their last flat moving right into yours do you? Agencies can provide background checks for a fee – which you can usually pass on to the tenants and also take care of any midnight call-outs – not to mention finding the tenants in the first place!
 
Ensure That You are Insured
While this might seem blatantly obvious, it is by far the most important consideration of the lot. In my five years experience of being a student, I know of at least two groups of people who caused a fire and had to move out while the fire damage was repaired. Taking the toaster into your bedroom when you are blitzed may seem like a good idea at the time; but bed covers and heating elements don’t go well together! Many specialist companies like CIA Insurance can offer policies and advice to ensure that you have the right level of cover. The last thing that any property investor wants is to owe the bank a mortgage for a property that was destroyed. Fire is not the only force that can be of detriment to your rental – flooding, mold or disastrous tenants can all cause your property value to plummet!

personalfinance,"20, 5k in student loans, garnishee, and freaking out. What can I do to save myself?","So here is what happened. I went to Eastern Oregon University in Fall of 2013 for 1 term and had to drop out due to my FAFSA not coming in til the last second and I was unable to pay for the second term. This left me with ~$4500 owed to the college in loans. About a month or so later they sent me a letter saying that the debt was being sent to a debt collector, with a fee of $500 tacked on, in 30 days unless I set up a payment plan. I couldn't set one up because I didn't have a job at the time and let it just go by. A couple months later I have a job and am making enough to make small payments but I hadn't heard from anyone yet about it. When I asked a family member what to do they told me to wait until they contacted me. (I realize now that it was a bad move to do so.) Months go by and in that time I had gotten a job at a big retail store (which I still work for fulltime). In working for that store I transfered to another location farther from home but with fulltime and a PIC (Person In Charge) position. In order to make to work there I had to get a new car and ended up buying a 2015 Mazda 3 (~$17,800). Around tax season I decided to call the school to find out about the debt so I could set up a payment plan in hopes that they wouldn't garnish my tax return. They told me that the debt had been sent to the Oregon Department of Revenue and that I'd have to call them. I called the ODR and they told me that my state return was already seized but my federal had not. We agreed on a $25 a month payment plan to start off so that I wouldn't lose money. They sent me the paperwork and told me to take it to my bank to set up automatic payments (because I have direct deposit I thought this would be the best way to handle it without worry). My banks online service allows me to set up automatic payments by myself so I tried to do that. I thought it had gone through but hadn't realized that it didn't finish. Fast forward to a few days ago, I recieved a letter from the ODR telling me I am now a garnishee and that my debt of $5,045 would be garnished from my paychecks. I started freaking out when I read this thinking that I had been making payments. I called them yesterday (June 29th) and found out that the payments weren't being made and that I had messed up with the online automatic payments. They also told me that now that it is being garnished that there is nothing I can do except let it take money from my paycheck (which I make $12.65/hr 40/hrs a week) or pay the debt in full. They also told me they would only be allowed to take 20-25% out of each paycheck, whcih I get payed weekly, which is going to be very bad for me as money is already very tight. I am at a loss right now and very worried about things getting much worse. My current bills are =

- $350 for rent and utilities fluctuates between $50-$110 depending on water and electricity bills (I rent the second floor of a small home and share untilities with the people here)
- $260 for car insurance for the next 2 months because of the new car, it will be going down to about $180 in August when my policy renews.
- $60 for cell phone which is prepaid but it is also the only means of my work or family contacting me so I have to keep that paid.
- $100 for money borrow from a very strict family member. Next month will be the last payment for that though.
- $330 for the car.
- ~$200 for food and gas.

What can I do to help myself now? Thank you for your replies.

The refi would be at 4.125% for 30 years so I would be adding 3 years to the term.

personalfinance,Repost: Wife to receive $290K life insurance payout. Looking for input on how to allocate it towards a home purchase and more.,"I originally posted this late Friday, and while it received two quality replies it did not garner much attention.  We have now received the check and I'm hoping to receive more input and come to a consensus.  

&amp;nbsp;  

My wife’s father passed away months back and after going through the slow, bureaucratic process of jumping through hoops for the government (he was a federal employee) we finally received notification from the insurance company that we would be receiving his life insurance payout within 10 days or so (roughly $290K).  

&amp;nbsp;  

I have lurked this board for a while.  I feel that I’ve got us going in the right direction financially (I will detail this below).  I’ve also familiarized myself with the [winfall]( http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) section and the [""I have $X, What Do I Do With It?""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and have sent this information on to my wife for her to read.  I didn’t really see any information about considerations on house purchases so I came here to get some clarification.  

&amp;nbsp;  

######**Pertinent info**  

&amp;nbsp;  

* My SO and I (both recently turned 30) make combined roughly $90K (this should go up to roughly $105k soon due to my wife’s promotion) in a metropolitan area of Florida.  We currently have no kids or obligations.  
* Budget-wise we generally save, at most, $500 monthly (although usually less or sometimes negative, currently working on getting a stricter handle on this and eliminating all wastes).  
* Cash on hand + emergency fund: $40K in bank accounts.  
* Retirement  
	1. My 401k - $61K balance / 4% match / current contribution 10%
	2. Wife’s 401k - $14K balance / no match / not currently contributing
	3. My ROTH - $8K balance / currently maxing 
	4. Wife’s ROTH - $4K balance / currently maxing
	5. My HSA - $500 balance / $500 annual contribution / $750 annual employer contribution  
* Debt  
	1. Car loan - $11K balance / 2.5% interest rate (not too concerned about paying this off)  
	2. We carry no credit card debt.  

&amp;nbsp;  

###### **Questions**  

&amp;nbsp;  

1. We want to purchase a house in roughly the $180K price range.  Should we purchase one outright? (i.e. would it be better to have our portfolio be ~= 75% real estate instead of financing some ambiguous “x” amount on the purchase?)  
2. Should we bump our emergency fund up to roughly 12 months’ worth of expenses? We both have stable jobs in stable fields.  
3. Should we have an “Oh $^!+” account of roughly $1K with the rest of our emergency fund in something slightly less liquid? (CDs – staggered)  
4. Should we up all our pre-tax retirement contribution amounts? (If we purchase a house outright, based on some rough calculations, we’ll be saving $700 a month [$1,200 rent payment gone minus roughly $500 a month in taxes and insurance based on some quick research for where I live].  And this is not factoring in the rise in income from my wife’s promotion.   
5. What to do with the sizeable amount left? ($60k+) Before we knew anything about this payout we had discussed a 2 week Europe trip which we had estimated to cost $12K, but besides that we don’t really want for anything.  
6. Should we consult a CPA? I read where life insurance payouts are not taxable, but I’d like to be assured.  
7.  Is there anything else I should be thinking of or consider?

If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $11,550 withheld for 2015 resulting in an overpayment of $9,285 when you file your return. If you want your withholding to more closely match your anticipated tax, adjust your withholding on a new Form W-4 as follows:

For the only job you entered (which has a projected salary of $30,000): 1 allowance.
Check the “Single” box on your Form W-4

Assuming this recommendation is in effect for the rest of 2015 your expected refund should be about $225. Following this recommendation will ensure that the amount withheld from your wages will cover all of your projected tax liability while minimizing your refund.


This suggestion just doesn't seem right to me since having only 1 allowance will essentially mean I will give them more each month. This is all just really confusing for me.

I thought I would have a lot more money to save and play around with since I got this job because it was a significant pay hike for me, but that has not been the case. After all my bills and expenses, I am left with hardly anything at the end of the month, I am essentially living pay check to pay check. Please help me optimize my take home pay if possible. I can provide more information if needed. Thanks.",finance,1435679312

personalfinance,question about consolidating my 206K student loans,"I have been reading through comments and trying to find people with similar situations, which have been plentiful, but seem to be getting somewhat mixed reviews. My financial advisor seems to be telling me I should consolidate (mostly for simplicity, can't tell if he thinks I just don't get what's going on or not), but I really wonder if that's the best option.

I make 116,000 dollars a year before overtime.

I have one private loan for 8,500 @ 6.22% but I'm going to get rid of that before the end of the year for simplicity and because the cosigner is a more distant relative than my parents.

The rest are all through one loan servicer and are all federal. 

2 loans @ 7.9% totaling about 18K

1 loan @ 7.21% for 6.9K

9 loans @ 6.8% for 88K 

1 loan @ 6.4% for 15K

1 loan @ 6.2% for 35K

1 loan @ 5.4% for 36K

To me it seems like, at the very least, taking care of my private loans and the loans over 7% before consolidating would be my best bet. But part of me feels like I shouldn't consolidate at all. I was a bit taken back by how pushy he was about it.

He also wants me to save 25-30K a year which is great and all, but it leaves me with 17.5-22.5K after my 28K/year lifestyle currently. Which seems a bit ridiculous to me as well. 

Some context, I'm almost 26 and have been in school since I was 4 years old. This is all pretty new to me, but I'm above average at living frugally (mostly because I'm used to this lifestyle) and I do a fair amount of ""loose budgeting."" I don't keep track of everything but keep things in separate accounts and only allow myself a set amount per week outside of basic life expenses that I have to transfer to my debit card account so I have a record of it. 

Any advice would be great. My advisor has been great so far other than this one (albeit huge in my eyes) issue.",finance,1435682929

personalfinance,Buying a house?,"Income - $83k/y gross.

I currently live at home so I have no bills other than car insurance($160/6mo), student loans, Roth IRA($200/m). I currently have about 40k saved from the last 2 years, my car is paid off, I have about 25k in student loans averaging about 5% making double payments on them they should be gone in 4 years. 

The market in my area ranges from 170k-250k for a single family home in a good area. I am in no rush to buy anything. I put about $3500 into savings every month, but I am wondering what the best course of action would be? Should I pay off the student loans all at once? I would like to put down 20% as to avoid PMI and I want to have at least 10k as an emergency fund. I am looking for a home that I can pay off in 5-7 years so I'm looking in the 200k range. Is a 5/1 or 7/1 (2.75-3%) arm at a lower interest rate a better option for me than a traditional 15/30? 

I should have at least $1600 bills if I purchase a house on the low end. I would plan on putting around $1800 toward additional mortgage payments, leaving me with $500-600/mo the put into savings.

personalfinance,I somehow need to pull $600 out of thin air this week...I don't get paid until the 15th.,"Hey /r/PersonalFinance. My apologies in advance for how stupid I am about this stuff. I tried doing research on my own and finally gave up because I was so badly confused and overwhelmed.

I need to put down $600 towards a security deposit on an apartment this week. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, as I usually have at *least* an extra $1k lying around in my savings, usually more.

The issue here is that rather than saving up for an apartment, I've been aggressively paying my school loans thinking I'd be moving in with my mom this fall, and then changed my mind a few weeks ago and here I am. I got paid today, but this paycheck is going straight into this month's rent, my loans (I've put them back to a minimum payment but that doesn't take effect till next month) and utilities. Long story long my nest egg is no more.

I do have a credit card. It's a Bank of America BetterBalance rewards card that I've never had to ""really"" use. I'll just buy gas or groceries with it once a month and then immediately pay it off. It's my first credit card to I'm pretty positive it sucks. My total credit line is $1500, my cash credit line (the heck is that?) is $450.

From what I'm reading on my last statement, it's a variable interest rate, and my Annual Percentage Rate (I understand none of this) is the annual interest rate on my account...which for purchases and cash advances seems to be 18.99%V, for direct deposit/cash advances 21.99%V, and for bank cash advances 24.99%V. [Now, I'm not a smart man but I know what high interest rates are.](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-24000-Forrest-Gump-Im-not-a-smart-ma-BkAv.jpeg)

My other option is to borrow money from my mom, who offered to take it out of her reserve credit (not 100% sure what that is either). From what she's told me, it'll cost around $40-$50 to tap into that reserve credit. I would, of course, pay her back when I get paid on the 15th. I'd love to avoid this if possible because a.) I would rather leave my poor mom out of this b.) I'm a proud creature, I haven't had to ask my parents for money since before I got my first job and I'd like to keep it that way. :c

Which of these does it make more sense to do? Is there a better way to make $600 appear this week that I'll immediately be able to pay back on the 15th?

personalfinance,California Notice of Proposed Assessment Help - I did not work a single day in California in 2013,"Hi /r/personalfinance,  

I've been a reader for several years and have enjoyed learning from many of you wise financial folk! Unfortunately, taxes are not my language and I was really hoping someone could help me out here on this one.. using a throwaway for my first time ever.  

Some back story:  

I worked for Foster Farms (a company headquartered in Livingston, CA) in 2012. I took a promotion to their plant in Farmerville, Louisiana in September 2012 and packed up and moved immediately.  I quit the company in June 2013 and moved in with my Mom in California. I did not make a single cent by working for any company or otherwise.. the only source of income I had was my savings and I withdrew ~$500 from my Roth IRA which I reported on the Federal Tax Return. In March of 2013 I filed my Federal and State returns for Louisiana only as my W-2 only had income information for Lousiana on it because.. well I didn't work a single day in 2013 in California.  

Fast forward to June 2015 and I get a letter in the mail saying I have an estimated $655 tax liability to California on top of a $163 delinquent filing fee.  

I went to the CA franchise tax board website and as I'm going through creating a 2013 return for CA I am feeling overwhelmed as I feel like none of it is relevant since I didn't even make any income in 2013.   

My questions are:  
1) Does Foster Farms having their HeadQuarters in California make the money I made as a resident in Louisiana relevant to the state of CA?  
2) Do I have to pay tax because I lived in CA starting halfway through the year in 2013 even though I made no money at all in the state?  
3) Do I still need to file a form or would sending them a printed version of my Federal and State returns from Louisiana be sufficient?  


TL:DR facts;  
- Didn't work a single day in California in 2013  
- Worked half of 2013 as resident in Lousiana before quitting and being unemployed for rest of the year  
- Employer's HQ is in California - job was in Louisiana  
- Successfully filed in 2013 for both Federal and Louisiana state  
- W-2 only lists information about Louisiana

personalfinance,Investing vs. Debt,"I've read the FAQs.  I've agonized over my budget.  I've gotten myself into a pretty good position.  I need advice on what makes the most sense.  Here are the facts.

I am 30.

I make plenty of money to support my lifestyle and have a good bit left over.

I have 6 months worth of take home pay in liquid cash as a rainy day fund (making 1%).

I put 10% of my money into a 401k currently.

I owe 113k on a home worth 165k at 3.75%.  

I owe 20k on a car worth 30k at 1.49%.

I have about 145k in my retirement fund.  ~130k of that is my 401k.  ~13k of that is in mutual funds.  ~2k of that is in an IRA that is making so little interest that I stopped contributing. 

My end goal is to be less stressed out about life and bills.  I pay extra on both the car and house currently, but would love to get to a point where I no longer carry debt on either without selling them and buying cheaper stuff.  The house is at a higher interest rate (avalanche method), but if I were to pay off the car, I could use that money to use that monthly payment towards the mortgage (snowball method).  I know that the car will not retain it's value across the next 10 years like the house will, but the car is far easier to sell off should something bad happen and I need the money.  

What would you guys do with the extra left over every month?  If this isn't the right spot for opinions on this, please let me know.  I have read enough in here that I see you guys frown on financial planners pretty heavily and I don't know where else to look for advice.",finance,1435692960

The main option I'm looking at now is a payday/auto title loan. I've heard nightmare stories about working with these kinds of companies but I'm fairly confident I can get through with little trouble because I guarantee that I'll pay it all back within 1-2 months so I don't mind putting up whatever for collateral and paying the high interest rate. I would just like to know if there are other, better options.

2. Guaranteed full repayment within 1-2 months, so no prepayment fees, please

I know high interest loans are generally not a good idea but it's fine in my situation, I have no risk if I pay it off in 2 months and I will. I'll lose money on the interest but I should make at least $1,000 with this loan so that should pay it off easily. Thanks for the help",finance,1435694691

Governments can already tax the currency by printing more of it. Why are they trying to turn all money into a hot potato situation where no one wants to hold it? 

There are banks in America such as Chase and Citi that are instituting anti-cash policies. Chase doesn't allow people to deposit cash into personal account unless they are the account owner. Citibank asks for your social security number if you deposit cash now.

Denmark has passed anti-cash legislation. 

They want all your shit in *their* computers so they can tax you for holding it, take away all your privacy, and then lock you out of the system like they did the Greek people. Now Greeks can only withdraw 60 EUR per day. 

I would like a buttcoiner to explain to me how fun it is to live with all your money frozen and get to withdraw 60 EUR per day.

There were Greeks who had their money in the bank last week or two weeks ago who were too lazy or too satisfied that the authorities were going to make sure everything was OK. And it'll be the same elsewhere. Everyone will feel that their government would never do something like that.

I've been offered an opportunity by two of my co-workers to invest in a local established chain. I trust the two very much, but both have differing opinions on the deal we are doing and whether or not I should do it!

First, the investment pertinents:

* 2.5% interest rate on a $2m investment
* $2m is for an established business and the property on which it sits
* The net income for the property and franchise is roughly $250k
* The business has been around for 7 years

Second, my personal information:

* I'm 23 years old
* I make $145k a year (and will be keeping this job)
* I am married and have 2 children.
* I have no investments, about $10k in checking/savings, and a net worth of $45k.

Now, I have the opportunity to buy in to just the business portion of this investment ($750k) or the business and the property ($1.25m for the property). 

Partner 1 says that it is fool proof, and while the return isn't great, it will be nice to have a steady ~$84k rolling in every year once the investment is paid off.

Partner 2 says that it is a great opportunity and he agrees with Partner 1, but that I shouldn't tie myself up with so much debt if I am uncomfortable with it.

personalfinance,Getting a student loan to invest even though I can finance my studies?,"I am 19 years old, in my first year of studies, and clueless whether this is a good idea.

Just a bit of a background:
 * I have ~ $3000 in savings.
 * I did well in high school and got academic discount at the University that I don't have to pay for tuition costs for the first year, I do well in university as well I am confident that I will get ~$600 academic discount on tuition costs for the next years.
 * My father is a business owner and can finance my studies in the future.
 * My father has agreed to give me the academic discount on tuition since he budgeted to pay for the studies.
 * I don't have any debt.
 * I have very little expenses with ~ $180 allowance per month (which will be ~$450 pm for the rest of this year).
 * I have not applied for a bursary, since I want to start to work at my father's business as soon as I end my studies.
 * My father promised a new car for my 21st birthday (or the equivalent amount of money which is ~$16 500, which I'd rather prefer.)
 * I live in South Africa that's why I added a '~' to the costs because it's a rough conversion to USD.

I want to know if it is a good idea to take a Student Loan to either invest or to use to start a small business (or even if it is legal to use a student loan for anything else than study costs, in which case I can arrange with my father to give me the money he budgeted for my studies then use my student loan to pay for the studies). 
 * Tuition costs at my university is ~$3000 per year (which my parents finance).
 * I make use of campus residence ~$2500 per year (which my parents finance as well).
 * My parents finance other costs such as fuel and food as well.
 * Student loans have an advertised interest rate of 9.25%.
 * Only the interest on the loan is payable each month while I am still studying.
 * One bank offered ~$5000 per year with 9,25% (prime rate, for your first year of studies), 8,25% for second year of studies and 7,25% for third year of studies.
 * Another bank offered ~$12000 at 9.25% but I don't know whether that is $12000 per year or once off.

I don't care to take risks with the money since if everything fails I will just pay back the loans when I start with my job. I have always loved to have micro businesses such as selling products online (through a local website similar to ebay), thus I would like to use the money in such a small business that I can manage in my free time. My father says that a business will have higher returns than the interest rate of the loan if I manage it well, most of the time.

Other options to just use my current savings in a fixed deposit show 6.10% interest rate on a 1 year term. My father suggested that I should invest in the stock market but I don't know how to get started with that, or in which companies to invest in for long term investments.

I am studying mechanical engineering, but I also have a very strong interest in business management (that's why I want to get capital from the student loans to invest in my own business/stocks/anything that makes sense).

I would please like some advice, I have no experience in investing other than having a fixed deposit and playing around on ""Wall Street Survivor"". I have awesome opportunities and I want to use them to my advantage.

**tl;dr** If I can find a promising investment, is it worth it (or legal) to get a study loan to invest in that investment.

personalfinance,Employee Stock Purchase Plan when my company's stock pays a dividend?,"EDIT: This is in the USA

Title sums it up pretty much. Plan details are:

* Company contributes $1 for every $9 the employee contributes

* Company contributions are counted as income for tax purposes

* Employee can contribute up to 20% of gross annual pay

* Employee can only sell shares that have been held for at least 1 year

* EDIT2: money made by selling stock purchased through this plan is treated as capital gains, not income

I make a good amount and already contribute to my 401(k) at the maximum that the company will match(I contribute 8%, company gives me 6%). I'm living with my parents for at least(and hopefully no more than) the next 18 months so I don't really have any expenses. Even after maxing my ESPP, I'll have a huge amount to throw at student loans(about 5.5% interest rate), which aren't huge to begin with.

The company is a large utility that has historically outperformed other similarly size utilities, but underperformed the DJIA and S&amp;P500. 

It has an annual dividend yield of about 4.8%.

So given that the company is a relatively safe investment, **pays a dividend** and gives me 11% matching, should I participate in this plan?

I know the advice is often to sell asap with this sort of plan, but in this case I'm getting a dividend too. What about treating it like retirement savings?",finance,1435704238
personalfinance,Parent plus loans: how to best attack when they are not in my name?,"I make 72.5k a year and have paid off all of the debts in my name. My parents took out parent plus loans for about 60k at 8.5% and due to the downturn in 2008 had to go into forbearance. Right now, I have taken over to try to get them paid off and all of my payments (above the minimum too) have been going to interest only for the past year. We tried to refinance, however were denied due to a late payment they had, despite me cosiging with an 800 credit score.

I want to do the right thing and pay it back, however I also want to move out. Is there a way I can either assume the loans in my name to be able to refi them myself or get a lower interest rate? As it stands now, I think they should apply for ibr and I will just pay the minimums for them for 20 years so the loansharks don't get their full balance.",finance,1435704571
personalfinance,Confused Son Trying to Figure out Parents' Finances,"Hello,

I will begin attending college in the fall, and I decided to use this summer to look into my parents finances and make sure everything is in order. I understand the basics of long term investing, but I'm not sure how much of my parents' money should be invested and if it is in the right spot. For reference, my parents are in their late 40's/early 50's, and I will be attending a school with a great need based aid policy. Our finances (numbers are changed slightly) are as follows:

Debt:

- $300,000 owed on a house valued at $330,000.

- $20,000 total owed on two cars.

College:

- Will cost a total of $20,000 next year, but I have about $4000 in subsidized loans. My parents are willing to pay for most of my college education (I plan on taking the subsidized loans on myself).

Savings:

- $90,000 in a savings account.

- $25,000 in a random Columbia Funds Mutual Fund (this is in my name for some reason).

- $4,000 in an IRA with Wells Fargo.

Salaries:

- $100,000 total annually

It is important to note that one parent (usually the higher earner) was unemployed all of last year and up until may of this year.

I have a couple of questions and I'm hoping you all can help me. Should I take the federal subsidized loans and then should my parents pay for each semester in full ($8000 * 2), or should I/my parents take more loans? How do we go about transferring the Columbia Funds money as well as the Wells Fargo IRA into Vanguard IRA's (and is this the best thing to do?)? How should we invest the money? Right now I'm thinking 75% index fund, 25% bonds. Finally, how much money should my parents invest every year? Thank you for your help.",finance,1435705193
