personalfinance,How Can I Pay My Tuition?,"I am about to register at a university as a non-degree student for the fall semester. I am currently on a medical leave of absence and I am also required to take a semester of classes (11-12 credits) during my leave. Tuition is about $1,500 per credit hour and I'm a little worried about how I would be able to cover the expenses. Community college and online courses are out of the question because I am *required* to attend a 4-year university that meets the standards of my home university. The university does offer payment plans but that still means I would need to pay a little under $4,000/month. 

I am already paying off one federal loan of $1,250 with ""beermoney"" and saving up my wages for tuition. I currently live at home and work part time, but I'm about to relocate to the area where the university is (parent switched jobs). I do plan on working during the semester and finishing up my medical treatment (mental and physical issues) so I can return to my home university for the spring semester. I already took care of the finaid stuff for my home university like I was required to do, but the only solution I see for paying for this university is through private loans since any federal loans would be for my home university (is that correct?). 

My mother urges me not to worry about everything and that it will get taken care of but I don't want to overburden her more than I already have and I'm really stressed about school and how I'm going to get the money. I've considered freelancing as a way to earn some money, but I didn't want to take that risk when I could work at a job that has guaranteed pay. I am a computer science and math double major at an Ivy League. 

So I was wondering what would be some financial sound ways to pay for school?",finance,1435709347

personalfinance,Underwater on a busted car - have no way to get to my new job,"I owe ~$6500 on my car. The KBB value is $3000. I took out a high interest registration loan (similar to a car title loan without giving up the title) to cover some expenses recently. Not sure how the loan company even qualified me for the loan as I have no equity but I needed the cash so I took it.

Some major rust has caused suspension problems that will cost ~$2500 to fix. Aside from that, the car is just falling apart. It's been plagued by various issues the past year and I don't think its worth the investment to repair. I have no cash, no savings, no available credit, no assets whatsoever.

I was underemployed in a high COL area until recently - I now have a 50k salary in a lower COL area. I am 23 years old. While I was underemployed I defaulted on several credit cards. I haven't made my car payment the past few months as I've been trying to catch-up with other life expenses. I already have roommates and don't have any nearby family to live with to reduce rent. 

My expenses are:

Rent: $650  
Car payment: $225  
Registration loan: $300  
Car insurance: $120  
Cell phone: $50  
Food: $150  
Gas: $120  

Total: **$1615**

My monthly gross income is **$4170.** I increased my federal tax exemptions to get a bit more take home income: **$3460.** 

I have not listed credit cards that have gone to collections because my main priority right now is to get a safe and secure form of transportation ASAP. My commute is about 25 miles each way.

With a credit score in the 400s I'm unlikely to get any financing any time soon.

personalfinance,Need clarification on how much to save for taxes (US New York),"Hey everyone I hope this is an appropriate post. 

So to set everything up I just started working half way through June in Brooklyn and haven't worked at all during the first half of the year.  I don't get taxes taken out of my paycheck and need to check to see if I'm saving the correct amount.  Each check (semi-monthly) comes to $1523.20 and my filing status is single.

I searched this sub and saw that paycheckcity.com got recommended but there were some things I wasn't sure when selecting the different options. The results I got with 1 federal allowance:

* Semi-montly gross pay - $1523.20
* Net Pay - $1132.32
* Amount I should save to pay taxes - $390.88

Does that look correct?

The questions about the options on the paycheckcity site were:
* Am I correct in leaving all the state/federal allowances/withholding 0?
* What's the difference between # of federal allowances, total allowances, and total allowances - NYC?

Thanks in advance. This is the first time I've had to take taxes out of my paycheck myself so I want to make sure I'm doing it correctly.",finance,1435718199

Bitcoin,VAT and fee's,"I am a bitcoin believer, but I have one question for those who say that bitcoin helps free us from government control. As soon as bitcoin starts to become even remotely popular, there is nothing to stop the feds from making up a special fee/tax on every bitcoin transaction. We pay fees at ATM's, tax's on gas, cigarettes etc etc.. . The government will get their money, one way or another. You may be free from fiat currency and the ""inflation"" that comes from printing, but how do you figure that a global digital currency isn't every central bankers/bureaucrats wet dream? The IRS is a huge hassle, the government would prefer not to have to wrangle with INCOME taxes, but if they didn't and instituted a tax only on transactions, right now people would just switch to cash and a lot things would go untaxed. The income tax, property tax, and inheritance tax are the best ways around that. Amazon would have ZERO technical problems adding a 5% tax on every bitcoin purchase. 

So, my question is, in a world where most people feel they have very little control over their governments and the taxes they impose, where people are shopping at fewer and fewer large scale vendors like Amazon/Apple/Netflix/etc.. and huge conglomerates that control everything, so that your ability to avoid control becomes harder, and where hacking/large scale disruptions are going to become more commonplace, especially large scale attacks from foreign nations (China/Russia/Middle East), and the fear that will come with it that will surpass any you have of having your home broken into (at least monetarily, most people fear of being raped/beaten in a home attack, not having their 401k's stolen), how do you suppose we can fully utilize the strengths of both Bitcoin and a physical currency to keep the power of our money as much in our hands as possible?",cryptocurrency,1435734745

financialindependence,[26m]Public sector awesome/terrible defined pension,"So I have a great new job in the public sector with all those sweet, sweet public sector bonuses. I can take advantage of up to $36k of tax deferred space, I get an insane 31 days of paid holiday annually (on top of the federal holidays so I guess 41 really), I get cheap healthcare and so forth but I also get a pension.

The way it works is that they take a mandatory 10% out of my gross as a pension contribution. They then pay 13% of my gross to the pension fund out of the employer's pocket. This money accumulates until I become eligible to ""retire"" at which point I get an income proportional to years of service and final income.

The problem is that I don't get to ""retire"" when I stop working. I get to ""retire"" when I'm 67, or have 30 years of service, or have my age + years of service equal 80. I'm 26, that means the earliest I could claim this would be in 27 years time, and only if I work for them for 27 years. Failing that I can't claim this for 40 years.

I spreadsheeted it and the pension is substantially more valuable than 10% of your savings in a 401k but I have absolutely no desire to work for the same employer (forfeiting potential raises from job changes etc) for 27 years for the sake of a pension.

I can't opt out, the only thing I can do is resign at some point in the future, at which point I get back my contributions only with 10% taken out as a penalty. I get nothing for the employer contributions on my behalf. Alternatively I can leave my contributions in the plan, although if I stop racking up years of service then I can't ""retire"" until 67. Also while I do have access to other plans there is no match on those and those are in addition to the defined plan, not instead of.

I had planned to go FI in around 12 years. Maybe 15. Worst case scenario for me would be around 41 years old, minimum I can do and retire by their definition would be 54. I kinda want to be a stay at home dad for a few years and maybe part time for a bit after that. Sacrificing 10% of my gross doesn't set that back hugely (50% saving rate) but it's a pretty huge kick in the teeth.

Does anyone have any advice or has anyone been in a similar situation before? I'm considering speaking to my supervisor about being rehired every year or so just to get my money out of the pension. It's a great deal if you really want to work 30 years but who the hell wants to do that. Making a retirement plan that only helps those who really, really want to work all their lives is crazy talk to me, it's like having a reintegration to society program for prisoners that specializes in the needs of lifers.

I am going to be starting medical school in August and just got information about loans/financial aid. I was lucky enough to get through my undergrad through scholarships and work, so I am in a pretty decent position financially right now. Furthermore, I will be paying Texas resident rates for school which is considerably lower than costs in other parts of the country. 

I want to minimize the amount of loans I need to take to get through medical school. I need some help/information about my various options. Here are the numbers I’m looking at right now:

* $5000 Savings 
* $0 Past Loans/Debt 

**Expenses:**

* $21,000 Tuition and Fees per year (for 4 years)
* $550 per month Rent/Utilities 
* $400 per month Living Expenses 
* Other initial moving expenses such as buying furniture, etc.

Here is information about the package my school sent:

**Option 1--Loan Package for Year 1**

* $21,000 @ 5.84% Federal Unsubsidized Loan #1 
* $15,000 @ 5.84% Federal Unsubsidized Loan #2
* $3000 @ 5% Loan from the School
* $6000 Grant

Aside from taking out loans, my family has a decent 401k plan through work. From what I understand, my dad is able to take out a loan from the 401k without incurring penalties as long as it is paid back within a designated amount of time. I’ve gone through the search function and looked into this more, but I’m finding a general consensus that it is bad to take out a loan from the 401k for other issues such as paying credit card debt or purchasing a house. Would that same advice be applicable toward my own student loans?

To throw a slight twist into these numbers, my parents are religiously opposed to the idea of taking out loans on interest, and would prefer to avoid doing so as much as possible. I believe they would prefer taking a loan on the 401k and taking in the potential losses from that decision over having to rely on interest from the student loans, but I want to explore all of my options before making a decision.

**Option 2--**

Take a loan from my parents’ 401k account, use it to get through at least the first 2 years of medical school with no debt. Afterwards, I will need to take loans for the final two years because my younger brother will be starting college and we will need to think about financing his school as well. Eventually, I will pay back the money I borrowed from my parents after residency.

Does it make financial sense to take out a loan from the 401k for at least the tuition and fees? We can figure out rent and other living expenses through current finances without taking loans. The way I see it, I will be guaranteed to prevent a loss of 5-6% through this method. However, it will be at the cost of loss of potential growth of that money if it had stayed in the 401k. Is my understanding of this correct? Would someone be able to help break down the longterm numbers between these two options? Thank you for your help!",finance,1435790581
personalfinance,"Temporary Summer Job- Full Time Hours, $13/hr, and being given a 1099 instead of expected W2","I just started a summer job at a local engineering/manufacturing firm. They had a need for rushed help with an order in the assembly floor, and I was told that it would be full time hours with available overtime, and last 2 or 3 weeks (But perhaps more, if client orders more of the same immediately). I was thrilled at the chance to get some cash in my pocket before college in the Fall, so I got there at 7AM and started my 9-hour day. As I was leaving and being given the last of my paperwork, the company CEO (small business) told me that I would be given the 1099 tax form instead of W2 for my work. 

From what I've researched, the 1099 seems to be for independent contractors, and it seems to me that being under a 1099 means:

1. I will receive full wages (Precisely hours * hourly rate) in each paycheck

2. I will need to pay my own federal/state taxes come January

3. I will end up paying more taxes overall due to medicare and FICA, which are normally split by Employer

4. I may be able to recover (Or perhaps pay less overall) some taxes through deductions as a ""self-employed"" contractor, due to status given by 1099.
 
I am 18 now, and worked last summer, receiving $675 gross and paid $71 in taxes to SS ($41), Federal income ($20), and Medicare ($10). Working for the company this summer, I will earn between  $1100 $1700, but potentially upwards of $2500 (Depending on how many weeks I am needed).

So now for the questions:

1. Overall, what should I do? Request a W2 or take the 1099? (What to do then about taxes?)

2. Is there anything I should be worried about as far as my employer taking advantage of me in this matter?

3. Under 1099, am I even required to file my own taxes due to the fact that I will only be making ~$2000, and the tax filing minimum seems to be about $6000?",finance,1435796001
personalfinance,House has ballooned in value. Should I sell to get rid of debt?,"My wife and I bought our first home 3 years ago when the market was great for buyer's in our hometown. Since then, the housing market for our city has surged and the home we purchased for ~190K, with a remaining mortgage of ~170K (@ 4.3% interest) could reasonably be sold for 260K. The ***only*** other debt we have is federal student loans which totals to ~60K. So here's the question, since we're not emotionally attached to the house, should we sell the home and use the difference to get rid of the debt. My back of the envelope math looks like this.

 260k The amount the house sells for

-170k  Amount left on the mortgage

-60k Student Loan debt

-10k Fees we end up paying to sell home

= 20k left for down payment/investment

My wife is currently looking for a new nurse practitioner job after graduating, and being mobile might allow us to expand her search a little (We won't leave the area completely though). My other thought is that if the house sells high, then we might use the capital to buy a comparable home in one of the up and coming neighborhoods while it's value is still relatively low.

I really appreciate any advice. I'm clueless when it comes to refinancing and attempts I've made to teach myself still leave me with questions about my own scenario. Thanks in advance!",finance,1435799599
personalfinance,Worth transferring banks from Capital one to Navy Federal Credit Union?,"Howdy! I'm currently active enlisted in the Navy at rank E-6 and have been using my capital one checking/savings account for a while now. There is nothing terribly special about the account, savings has a .1% interest rate and I don't receive any special benefits or packages (read: No reward points or anything of that nature).

I've done a bit of research into the Credit Union but it's a bit overwhelming having to figure out all the ins and out's of a credit union vs a bank, I've never used a credit union before so I'm not sure how precisely they differ. Is it worthwhile to transfer my money and business to the Credit union and close my bank account?",finance,1435800187
personalfinance,I don't think paying off your mortgage is the same as investing with an ROI of X% [discussion],"Hey p.f.,

So I was taking a shower and had a thought.  This is the most appropriate place to post this.

So a lot of people say that paying off your mortgage early is a good investment, essentially the same as investing at X% where X is your interest rate.

I think this is a misleading statement but since there is the possibility I am wrong, I figured here would be the place to get some analysis on the subject.  WARNING: I MIGHT BE WRONG, BUT LETS SOLVE IT TOGETHER!

So I'm going to try and ELI5 and use simple numbers to explain my logic.

ASSUMPTIONS:  I have a mortgage for a 100$ at 5% interest.  The note is for 10 years.  We will also assume I can earn 5% average APY in my 401k, which, very conveniently has 100$ in it!  
We also need to assume since I have extra money to pay my mortgage, if I was opting to put it into my 401k, I would invest the same amount as I would overpay my mortgage.  We'll assume that amount would be 5$ per year for both scenarios.  We will also assume that somehow, in 2015, you got a mortgage for 100% of the value of the home.


So I make 1 year of payments, at minimum would be $15 but since we have extra money, I pay 20$.  At the end of the year my remaining mortgage balance is $85 (roughly, probably something with change, since percentages).  But at the end of that same year, my 401k is now worth 110$, based on 5% growth and the extra 5$ i put in.  (Again, roughly, but probably something more like 110.xx)  

Now as we pay down the mortgage, the amount we put towards principal is increasing while the amount you pay towards interest is decreasing.  While the rate is the same, the amount of money that goes towards each is different.  Yes, we are building equity, but a 401k also has equitable value.  Equitable value that is being reinvested in and growing based on that reinvestment.

So at the end of the year, your home also sees market value growth of 5%, so it is now ""worth"" $105.  And essentially, I am only 20% vested in at this point in time.  My 401k I am 100% vested in and is now worth 110$ and will continue to grow based on that 110$ value!

My logic might be overly simplified or totally flawed.  Let's discuss, /r/personalfinance!

The goal of the discussion is whether or not we should be perpetuating the statement that ""Paying off your mortgage early is the same as investing, but with guaranteed ROI.  I think that statement might be a little too simple for people outside of this thread, or possibly a total misnomer!  I will do some edits later for any conclusions we draw.  And please, if you are going to post how I am wrong, be nice about it!",finance,1435800350
personalfinance,(AUS/US) Would appreciate advice on multi-country investing.,"First time posting here, though I've been a frequent visitor. I've been reading all the information here, but it's possible I've missed something so I apologize if I'm asking something silly.

I'm an US citizen who moved to Australia to be with my partner, who is an Australian citizen. We're not married as of yet, but we're in a de facto relationship and have joint funds. We just changed banks to take advantage of higher interest rates and lower fees. I have no debt. My partner has university debt, but it's interest free and comes out in his taxes so it's nothing we really worry about. We have no children (though don't tell our dog and cat) and don't plan to anytime terribly soon--maybe 4/5 years from now. We do both have Superannuation accounts here (which are essentially AUS 401ks), our contributions come out automatically with each paycheck. As my paycheck is significantly smaller than my partner's, my Super fund isn't anything exciting at this point but his is about 40k now.

In our Australian bank account, we now have about 30k in a high interest savings account (3.5% interest rate), which we're hoping to deposit about $2300 a month. We're planning to us this money to eventually be a down payment on our first house. We currently rent and have no current plans to buy in Australia as the housing market here is out of our range. However, we are planning to move to the US in about two or three years and would be looking into buying a house there, so we don't want the money tied up for any length of time.

Apart from our money here, I have another 25k or so in a few bank accounts back in the US. Most of this money has just been released from bonds my lovely grandparents set up for me, so I haven't really had to consider what to do with it before now. I generally get a bit of money as gifts from family each year that I would add to this annually. The past two years it's been about 5k.

I think we're currently doing alright with our money in Australia (though let me know if you think we could be doing something better), but I'm not sure what would be my best options for the money in the US. From what I've read, most people suggest putting money into a retirement fund such as an IRA, but I'm not 100% sure if I can open one while I live and work in Australia. I do file my taxes in the US as I should, but I don't make enough here to actually have to pay any. Also, if I've been reading things correctly, it looks like I wouldn't be able to put all my money into an IRA all at once, as they have limits, so what would I do with the rest of it? We could be putting more directly into my partner's super; would that be better to do and then put the 25k into some investment not retirement focused? I've also looked into wiring the money to Australia to have all our money together in the savings account, and though right now we would ""make money"" with the exchange rate, I don't know if that would be too risky if we're planning to switch it back to USD in the future?

Though I have been doing my best to read up on things, I really am not sure what our best options would be. My father is looking into things for me as well, but I'd like to be able to make informed decisions as well.

Thank you so much for reading. Sorry if I over-shared, I just wasn't sure what would be pertinent.",finance,1435801981
personalfinance,(USA) Schwab Mutual Funds,"I recently opened a basic brokerage account with Schwab with some money that I managed to save up while I was in college. I pulled in $2,300 from my savings account at a local bank I’m planning to close in favor of Schwab (no ATM fees anywhere, no minimum balance, no foreign transaction fee, no branches, etc.). I was able to save up this money because my employer at the time paid all of my tuition. I have no student loans, no credit card debt, and no dependents.

I’m currently making about as much money as you would expect a graduate student to make, and with that I have the capacity to drop $100 a month into my savings, and another $100 a month into mutual funds. And that is what I intend to do. I already have the cushion in my checking account taken care of, as well as the growing emergency fund in my savings account. This thread seeks to focus on mutual fund investments with Schwab.

I looked at Vanguard and Fidelity, only to find that their funds in general wanted higher initial investments than I was willing to put down as I’m just getting my feet wet. It’s possible that when I’m up to working with over $10k, I’ll move to Vanguard. But at least for the first few years I intend to stay with Schwab. My question is more about what to do with Schwab, rather than how a different broker would be better.

With that $2,300 I put ~$750 into stocks that I a few stocks bought just to hold onto forever. Plus another ~$50 in the fees for buying, but I’d rather not think about that because that’s lost money and I’m going to have to pay another ~$50 again should I ever need to pull them out. So I’ll just hope that the lot of them has gained at least $120 when that day comes. These stocks are companies I know, so I’m just going to hold onto them indefinitely.

I purchased $793.72 divided evenly (dollar amount, not share amount) of the following ETFs: SCHB (broad market), SCHE (emerging markets), SCHF (int’l equity) and SCHG (US large cap growth). I bought these separate from my mutual funds, because I may have to pull some or all of this out in the fall to pay some tuition in the fall.

I put another $700 into four mutual funds. SFENX (fundamental emerging markets), SWASX (global real estate), SWORX (target 2055 [I will be 63] fund) and SWPPX (their flavor of the S&amp;P 500). I want to be diversified without too much overlap between the funds. 

I realize that I’m starting investing at a bad time (Grexit, Puerto Rico bankruptcy, etc.) but I had to start some time or else I’d just sit staring at a savings account with a 0.01% interest rate scratching my head wondering why it’s not going anywhere for an eternity.

My long-term goals are homeownership (big down payment, not trying to pay so much in interest that I may as well be renting the first few years that I live there) and just continuing and enhancing the general financial stability throughout life that I have enjoyed thus far. I’m not anticipating any windfalls because that’s the nature of windfalls, you shouldn't count on them.
 
With the institution I currently work for and intend to continue working for after graduation in May 2016, I am not eligible for a tax-differed IRA for another year. It sucks, but I can focus on putting into Schwab in the mean time. A year from now, I will look into getting my 403b started.

The real reason I’m starting this now, even with this small amount is that I want to have it in order so that as I transition from grad school to a career, my finances can already be on autopilot. I’ll have much more consuming things to be thinking about this time next year. At that point it will just be a matter of upping the amounts, not a total restructuring of how I do this as it is now, because it’s summer and I’m just working. So I have spare time.

I would like to continue depositing $100 a month into some mix of the mutual funds I’m already invested in/whichever ones I add. My question is this: I have exactly four mutual funds at this moment; I would like to move up to six or eight and keep it there indefinitely while it grows naturally and from my biweekly contributions. While ETFs may offer more focused options, the mutual funds are better for automatic investing. Which funds should I buy? Giving strong preference to Schwab mutual funds as they’d be cheaper for me. As you can see from the four I’ve selected, I’ve favored index funds for their lower ERs. But, as it is the case that I’m posting on Reddit, I’m very open to suggestion.

Background;  
I am 22 years old living with my mother, recently single (was living with my mother during the relationship), Im admitting I have a spending problem although I have tamed it from buying stuff I don't need anymore to just buying energy drinks and fast food. :o My employment status is Retail, National Guard and Lyft (Although, I haven't picked any more passengers because I haven't wanted to use the gas since I'm already on a limited income, would like to.) I would like to get employed by a Police Department so they can send me to the Police Academy. Which brings me to, I had applied and got all the way up the to background check of my counties Sheriff Department. A couple weeks ago I got a letter stating that I wasn't picked, no reason given. I know why though, my finances, everything else in my life is perfect, never been in trouble with the law (Did get my first speeding ticket after Basic Training, Im currently paying, dumb infraction, 65 in 55 leaving a town in complete dark with just headlights, I had never been too. Anyway Im guilty not complaining about it) but nothing past a speeding ticket, no drugs etc. It hit me hard, I want to be an Officer but my spending I feel is affecting that. Next, during Christmas break, I was in town from BCT, my mother just recently divorced needed a better car, she had a 2013 Fiesta, had ALL kinds of problems, dangerous. She finally decided to buy a new car, her credit was stopping her from doing it on her own, (She has the income though) Im a Co-Buyer on her 2015 Optima. So thats $23k on my credit. Back to Basic Training, I was getting paid well 1500 a month. No Debt cause i was paying what i was spending on my Credit cards. Get out of basic, my then GF wanted to take a couple trips, went to the beach etc. Cards still good. Everything good. Well my dad need the car I was using for work, i needed a car for work and drill. So I bought a 2015 Optima AMAZING car. $24k for mine. Used my mom as a Co-Buyer since i helped her. So now I have $47k in debt to my name. TECHNICALLY, really its only the $24k for my car. Well GF still wants to go a little road trips so I take her, using my credit cards, DUMB. Now I'm F'ed. 

I need help paying my balance of my cards and adding money to savings. 

Heres a picture of my monthly expenses. I know where I can cut at least $20.00 or more. 
It really sucks living like this. Before anyone says ""YOU DONT NEED THAT CAR, it was irresponsible."" Was it? Maybe. Where there other cheaper options, Yes. (I won't buy used so thats not an option) I need a very reliable car for drill.

personalfinance,Can someone please help a recent high school graduate with job questions?,"I just graduated high school this spring, and am going to college this fall. I was looking for (and got) a summer job, but I had a few questions about everything since it was all a huge rush and I feel like I went too far too quickly. 

Some background: I replied to a job posting on Craigslist a couple days ago, and was told to come in for an interview today. However, after the manager got some basic information via an application form and a couple questions regarding my availability, I was given a couple shirts and told to start my training/working today. I was also told to bring in my social security card and drivers license tomorrow, and also that I would be paid $9/hour and I would work 48 hours a week because anything more is overtime.

While working, there was a lull between about 2 and 4, which is when I was told it is federally mandated that I take a break (unpaid), 30 minutes to an hour. I was also told that I need a work permit because I'm still a minor, even though I graduated high school. 

After clocking out, I got a receipt that said I clocked in at 10:38am, clocked out at 9:53pm, had a 39 minute break in between, so recorded 10:36 of work. 

So, I have a couple questions about my situation that I was hoping someone could answer for me:

-I read that the legal limit for non overtime is 40 per week, and that anything over is overtime (http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs22.htm), is my manager allowed to make me work 48 a week and not pay overtime? If no, should I address this with my manager and demand overtime or a shorter week? 

-Am I required to produce a work permit? Do I just fill it out and submit it at work, or do I need to send it somewhere? If I do need a work permit, will the hours I worked today before filling out a work permit count towards my paycheck? 

-Isn't my manager supposed to write a contract or document that states my hours, days I'm working, hourly wage, etc. and have me sign it saying that I agree with it? 

-Is the break time mandatory? There isn't much to do between 2-4 and I'd much rather get paid and just wait by my station than just sit around doing nothing. The website ( http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs22.htm) says that rest time is typically 20 minutes and paid, but meal time is 30 minutes and unpaid. I don't exactly have a meal time, so am I supposed to be paid through my break, if it is required? 

-Will I receive my paycheck in the form of a check, direct to bank account, or does it differ per establishment? 

-Does my manager really require my social security card? 

These are the questions I have so far, I might have some more that I come up with tomorrow before work (I'm pretty tired and it's already 12:30 so I might fall asleep soon), but any help would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1435810886

news,China relaxes margin rules as share prices fall,"CHINA’S securities regulator has relaxed rules on margin trading -- borrowed funds that fuelled a spectacular stock market rally -- after measures including an interest rate cut failed to stop equities falling.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) removed some limits on investors' minimum deposit requirements, it said on its website late Wednesday.

Margin investors only need to deposit a small proportion of the value of their trade, generating bigger profits for a given amount of money put down -- but also bigger losses.

Authorities tightened rules on the practice in June in an attempt to curb enhanced market risks, but the move was among the triggers for the recent heavy falls in Chinese shares.

Shanghai closed down more than five percent on Wednesday, resuming its downward trajectory after days of heightened volatility.

personalfinance,Just learned what a credit card balance transfer is. Can someone please check my math?,"Hey all. I am trying to buckle down and get serious about paying off my credit card debt. I just recently learned what a balance transfer is (at least I'm pretty sure I understand it) and it seems like something that could really help me. I put together a spreadsheet comparing the payoff time for my current CC versus a basic Discover card and a Visa card that my credit union offers. Will someone please check my spreadsheet to make sure I have a good grasp on the math? I want to understand how this works before I take any action.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmJ724uneEt0glHPQqLKfYB4k9MV8lXTeRDp1ZN4K1Q/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmJ724uneEt0glHPQqLKfYB4k9MV8lXTeRDp1ZN4K1Q/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;nbsp;

**Additional information:**  

* I used green to highlight the point at which my balance would be negative, indicating that the card is finally paid off.  

* I have excellent self control and can easily avoid using the card. I would only use it in the event of an emergency, as I unfortunately do not have an emergency fund yet.  

* I can't afford to pay more than $200 a month.  

* For the Discover card, after 12 months the APR could land anywhere between 11% and 23%. For my calculations, I estimated 14% to match my current CC's interest rate.  

* I have not really looked beyond the cards mentioned in the spreadsheet. I've always been curious about the cards that allow you to earn something in exchange for using them, but I am not sure if those cards would be appropriate for a balance transfer.

&amp;nbsp;

**Additional questions:**  

* I can't wrap my head around this: I can pay off my current CC in 25 months and will have paid $611 in just interest alone. With Discover I can pay off my CC balance in 23 months and will have paid only $107 in interest. That's only 2 months sooner, and a difference of $504. In interest only. Does that sound right? I may just be struggling to put two and two together.  

* My credit union has the following footnote next to the 7.75% Variable APR bullet: ""The variable APR is subject to change quarterly and is based on the first 6-month Treasury Bill Auction held each quarter which establishes the index. A margin of 7.5% is added to the index to establish the interest rate."" Does that have any significance I should be aware of? What do they mean by ""a margin of 7.5% is added to the index to establish the interest rate?""

&amp;nbsp;

If anyone made it this far, thank you very much for taking the time. I am not at all knowledgeable in the realm of personal finance, credit, etc. Strategic money management is a new concept to me and I hope to learn a lot here.

Thanks!

**Update for posterity:** After weighing all my options, I chose to apply for the Chase Slate card. I am currently waiting for my card to arrive in the mail and for the balance transfer, which is currently pending, to process and hopefully come back approved.",finance,1435831346

My job starts August 3rd and is in a different state. I have $1900 in my account, July rent paid, no car and no credit card. I have federal student loans of $28k and Parent Plus loans of $35.5k that I need to pay (my parents are in no shape to pay that much). Both loans are in grace period until November. The estimated payments for 10 yr payment plan for both loans combined is around $700-750/month. 

**Job Offer and Future:** I got an offer for 68k per year with approximate bi-weekly pay around $1800-1900 after taxes. I would have to move but the company is helping with moving expenses. I would also need a car. The rent in the new location is around $600-$900 for one bedroom depending on the neighborhood. The company matches 5% to 401k as well. I'm 22 with no other obligations than to these debts and myself. My contract is only for 2 years with the company but they have said that normally everyone gets a full-time offer at the end of 2 years (they have had 45 people go through with the same starting position with nearly 100% placement into full-time positions).

**Questions** 

* What car should I buy? Used/New ? I have no credit history so that is a big issue here for me. Also only $1900 in checking of which I might need some during relocation as some of the help is in the form of reimbursement after I have moved. 

* How much money should I put into my 401k monthly? Just the 5% match? How about monthly savings for emergency? 

* I should easily be able to pay more than the minimum required by the standard repayment plan for the student debt. So how much extra should I pay if I want to save some for emergency funds?

* What should I spend on rent per month at most? Is there a rule of thumb regarding % of income that should go to rent?

personalfinance,Student loan payoff strategy,"Currently in law school and will graduate (law and undergrad) with about 140k of debt. I've been paying back @ just above the interest accumulation point for the past year but now i have more income and would like to pay more. Average interest rate is 5.4%, but i have one at 7.21% interest rate. I can pay 200/month either way - monthly interest rate accumulation is ~165.82 as of today. Should I put that 200 towards all the loans as a bulk pay right now, or should i only put it all towards the 7.21% interest loan. I'm in school and payments are deferred until at least next august, but i'll start making full payments in June. My goal, like many, is to pay this off as quick as possible. 

Should things work out my starting salary will be 140-160k in a city like Detroit/Cleveland/Columbus/Minn. With this in mind my goal is 2.5 year payoff from graduation.",finance,1435848462

financialindependence,Looking for advice on paying off student loans strategically.,"Hello, I have recently started paying attention to my student loans, and now I am looking for some advise. I have been going to school for some time, and until very recently haven't had much extra spending money. I am looking over my unsubsidized loans, and I am starting to think strategically about how I should pay these back, specifically which loans I should target first. Here is a brief breakdown of each unsubsidized loan (these are all fixed rate): 

Loan 1 - Original Balance: $7,500.00, Unpaid Interest: $433.08, Interest rate: 6.8%  

Loan 2 - Original Balance: $4,000.00, Unpaid Interest: $83.39, Interest rate: 4.66%  

Loan 3 - Original Balance: $1,825.12, Unpaid Interest: $282.26, Interest rate: 6.8%  

Loan 4 - Original Balance: $1,500.00, Unpaid Interest: $303.67, Interest rate: 6.8%

Loan 5 - Original Balance: $650.00, Unpaid Interest: $21.35, Interest rate: 3.86%   

I have ~2,000.00 dollars to throw at these loans, and my intention was to pay the interest off entirely. The current total interest is $1,123.75, which would leave me with 876.25. My initial thought was to target loan 1, which has the largest principal balance and a 6.8% interest rate, and begin paying off the principal balance as I have extra money. But there is also the strategy of paying off the smaller loans, such as loan 3, 4, or 5 first to absolve them completely before targeting the larger principal balance loans.

investing,Should I add bonds and REITs to my dividend growth portfolio?,"23 y/o dividend growth investor here. Right now I have all of my investments exclusively in dividend growth ETF's. My strategy is to continue investing in dividend growth stocks/funds and let the dividends compound over my lifetime in my tax advantaged accounts. With that in mind I wanted some opinions on diversifying my portfolio specifically with bonds and REITS. My biggest questions are: 

1. Should I be investing in bond ETFs/Funds even with the inevitable interest rate hikes and the already conservative nature of my portfolio? Would it be best to invest in a fund that specializes in short, intermediate, or longterm bonds (maybe even a mixture)? Would it still be worth converting a small portion of my portfolio into bonds (10%)?

2. Same question with REITs. Should I invest in REITs with the same interest rate hikes or would it be better to just continue investing in my dividend growth funds until the interest rate issue becomes a little more stable? Also if I were to invest in REITs given my age what would be an appropriate allocation? 10, 15, or even 20%?

EDIT: I don't know if it's helpful or not to know but any investments I make will be in ETF's (most likely through vanguard) like VNQ, BLV, etc. I get them commission free and it gives me plenty of diversity right away. 

I'm still learning a lot about these things so any insight or pointing me in the direction of where I can learn more would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1435856846
personalfinance,"Just performed a balance transfer between credit cards, what happens to my credit?","I just balance transferred $2900 from one credit card with an interest rate of 15% to a Chase Slate card with 0% interest for 15 months. Obviously I wanted to do this to avoid interest and plan on paying it off in the 15 months. However,  my real question comes with what happens to my credit. The card that I transfered from I've had the account for 10 years and has an $8000 credit limit. Being that a just opened the Chase credit card account the limit they approved me for was $3000. So I've almost maxed out the new credit card and zeroed out the one with an $8000 limit.

As far as I know,  it's a smart decision to keep the larger card open for credit reasons and also plan to in case of emergency (which is how the 2900 got on there with car troubles/emergency flight purchase). Has my credit taken a significant hit at all? Does the effect of having a larger gap between the larger credit card and amount used outweigh the almost maxed out,  smaller card?",finance,1435856952

Long time redditor here, posting on an alt account.  I'm looking for somebody to clean up my credit &amp; tax history.

For a while I never took care of anything until it came to bite me in the ass.   Quit filing taxes, went to the hospital one time while I was unemployed/no insurance.  I just returned all the medical bill envelopes &amp; blocked all the phone calls  ($14k for one goddamn night in the hospital with no surgeries or anything - fuck them) I got about any of it. Call it depression, substance abuse, whatever - not a great plan, but that's where I'm at.  I haven't been served or sued or garnished for the debts, but I'm sure they haven't forgotten that I owe them money. I'm sure the IRS noticed that I 'forgot' to file and they'll remind me someday if I don't 'remember'.

I've since picked myself up, got an awesome job, started playing sports and going back to school.  I'm good enough at volleyball that I'm competing for serious cash prizes - not quite enough to go pro, but maybe someday...

Anyway, between volleyball, nighttime classes/pursuing MBA, working, I'm pretty 

damn busy.  On a typical day - get up at 6 for work, go straight to class and/or 

volleyball after, may get home around 10 or 11 to be in bed between 11 and 

midnight.  I know a lot of people say it as a cop-out, but seriously - I'm busy - 

really busy.

...enough to the point where I'd rather pay someone to take care of all this crap 

for me than take days off sports or classes to do it myself.  I live about an hour north of philly.  My cash flow is fine - I make a good salary and I'm not a big spender; have no old credit card debt, student loans are paid off, and I own my car.

The IRS website told me to stop into a local IRS office and explain my situation, but I can think of a couple reasons why that might not be a good idea.  Is there someone that can negotiate down some of my past debts (mostly minor bullshit for like $100 or $200 here and there that I never bothered paying, and one major bill for the hospital), pay them off, and file my old tax returns for me?

I'd really like a one-stop-shop type option.  Whatever the old bills end up costing, I can pay it.  Whatever they charge for services I'm willing to pay as long as I'm not getting overtly scammed or ripped off.  For my old income records, etc, I **have** them all, neatly stuffed in a box mostly unopened (always intended to get around to them someday).  So, do I look for a money manager?

I'm looking for guidance in making the best financial move here because leaving my job is a one-way door. If you need any more info just ask, but I'm trying to be vague because Id like to leave my job on my terms.

personalfinance,Looking for input on which cards to use for expenses,"A few weeks ago I saw an idea here that suggested keeping one credit card at home in a drawer dedicated to online auto bill pay and a second for physically swiping so, in the event that your physically used card gets compromised, you don't have to deal with the hassle of updating a dozen auto bill pay settings.

So I'm looking at my current cards and deciding which to use for what. Interest rates have no influence in the calculation since I'll be paying each in full every billing cycle.

Card|	Type|	Limit|	Rewards|	In Dollars|
:--	|:--	|:--	|:--	|:--
Capital One Platinum Secured|	MasterCard|	$500|	N/A|	N/A|
Capital One Quicksilver/Platinum|	Visa|	$3,000|	1.5% cash back|	1.5% cash back|
Capital One Venture Rewards|	Visa|	$15,000|	2 miles per $1 spent|	2% cash back when spent on travel, 1% when cashed out|
Discover IT|	Discover|	$5,500|	Double points for 1 year * 5% rotating and 1% on all else|	10% select categories; 2% all else|

I'm 35 and living in an expensive city. I currently make about $44k/year pre-tax. However, I'm sick of city living, and have firm plans to relocate in August to a small (cheap!) Midwest town to live with my long-distance boyfriend (""LDB"") of 4 years and quiet down. To give you an idea of the cost-of-living difference, my current rent is $1100, and my share of rent at his house is $225.

(I know people will ask, so the sitch with LDB is that he's older and he is The One. We're child-free and we are not planning marriage because our relationship is fantastic just the way it is...minus the distance thing.)

The job situation in the new place will be interesting, but I am going to be able to work remotely with my current employer for a while before I find a local gig. I'll be looking for admin work but I'll take anything (legal!) that pays in dollars and cents.

I have what I would estimate to be at least $50k of student loan debt. I haven't made a payment since 2010, and collections ensued in early 2011. They started to harass my family (who live in other states), so I sent a stop-contacting-me letter in early 2012, which they have complied with. I haven't seen **anything** from them since that letter -- not a fucking thing.

Other pertinent information:

1. I have an emergency CC (limit $1k) which I use for true emergencies (like travel in the event of sudden family death), and it is paid off immediately when used

2. I had a separate CC with a high balance ($12k) but it was charged off last year

3. I pay my rent on time every month and have not been late or missed a payment in over 4 years

4. My 401k plan with my current employer is fully vested with a balance of about $10k. Not sure what to do with it yet but for now it's staying put

5. I do not know my credit score, but I would estimate it at Poor

6. I budget. Fuck yes I budget. I also have some savings (about $3k)

I truly do not ever want to own a house, and I never have. I do not own a car, but my LDB has one and we want to stay a 1-car household. (He commutes via bike and I plan to explore this option also.)

I've obviously made some very poor financial choices and this debt is my deep, dark, shameful secret: no one knows about it. My LDB doesn't know and I'm frankly terrified to tell him (he has a sky-high credit score and is very smart with his money), but I know that conversation is approaching rapidly. :(

I own and have read Bankruptcy for Dummies, and there's a tiny section that says [terrible paraphasing], ""We're not really supposed to say this, but if you don't ever plan to own a house or make big purchases, you can sit on your debt and hope it won't affect your life.""

I also want to ask for advice about debt that's in collections. I know deep down that if collections agencies had human interest in mind and offered sensible (read: realistic) payment plans, I could have gotten the ball rolling on that chunk of shame and be chipping away at it. Does this possibility even exist?

Another wrench in the cog is that when I signed the promissory note for the loan, it was through a private entity...but it became federally-backed a while ago. I'm really unsure if a bankruptcy would even help.

I THINK I know what I should do, which is schedule an appointment with a bankruptcy lawyer as soon as possible and explain the situation to explore my options. I want input though, from random internet strangers!

Bitcoin,Coindesk: Brazilian Congressman Calls for Hearing on Bitcoin Regulation,"Brazilian Congressman Calls for Hearing on Bitcoin Regulation

Pete Rizzo (@pete_rizzo_) | Published on July 2, 2015 at 19:16 BST NEWS

Brazilian Congressman Manoel Junior has proposed a public hearing to discuss bitcoin and digital currency regulation.

The hearing, if held, would involve representatives from Banco Central do Brasil; the Receita Federal, the Brazilian tax enforcement agency; Conselho de Controle de Atividades Fiancerias, the country's anti-fraud agency; and representatives of the local bitcoin industry.

CoinBR CEO Safiri Felix, the only company named in the official request, indicated that discussions about such a meeting have been ongoing since a report on the technology was released by the Brazilian Senate in December 2014. At the time, the report recommended bitcoin regulation was unnecessary.

Felix told CoinDesk:

""The government thinks that it's time now to make this conversation deeper. We're trying to get space to educate authorities to make sure we're making a legal framework that doesn't affect the implementation of bitcoin. We're trying to learn from US and Canada and Europe to make a good legal framework for market development.""

Felix admitted to being part of early discussions on the meeting, which he suggested could be attended by experts from local universities and law firms.

The official letter from Congressman Junior elaborates further on the interests of the local government in the discussions. In particular, Junior suggested that there has been little discussion about the potential impact on financial markets.

""There are some relevant questions which need to be asked in relation to bitcoin’s increase use,"" Junior wrote. ""Could it potentially replace fiat currency as a form of payment, unit of account and a store of value? If so, how would this impact the country authorities’ ability to define monetary and exchange policies?""

Junior also suggested his opinion that such risks should be assessed in order to maintain security as the technology becomes more widely adopted.

Community reaction

Since the announcement of the potential hearing yesterday, there has been both excitement and outrage in the local community.

For example, Brazilian entrepreneurs expressed their hope that a wider selection of the country's bitcoin companies would be able to attend the meeting, though Felix suggested that this was the ultimate intent of the hearing.

Reports indicate that there has also been widespread backlash about the news on Facebook groups specific to the Brazilian market.

Felix indicated that outcry had been particularly animated from those who had ""sympathy for libertarian views"". However, he suggested CoinBR's goal was to be an active participant in this process so that the needs of local businesses are heard as regulation is crafted.

Elsewhere, Marcelo Miranda, CEO of local bitcoin exchange FlowBTC, attested to the strong negative reaction to the hearing proposal, which he attributed to the varying ideologies of local users and questions about CoinBR's motives and involvement in the hearing.

""The hearing could be a step in the right direction or a real turn off for a market that is still in its infancy. It is really hard to tell with the information we have now,"" Miranda said.

personalfinance,Larger Down Payment on Home or Pay Off Car?,"Me and my wife purchased a home when we were 19 for 146k. During the last 4 years we refinanced several times and took upwards of 60k out of our homes value. After wanting to move back home to simplify our life we found a house for 244k and sold ours for 365k leaving us with 125k in net profit. We immediately paid off all of our personal Credit Card debt and Loan Debt (16k). We're going to be putting 100k down on this 244k house and putting 10k in our savings.

My only concern is this. Should I pay off my new Honda Accord (20k Pay Off) and put 80k down on my house or put 100k on my house.

I've already talk to my loan officer, putting 80k versus 100k would adjust the payment $108 a month, our current Honda car payment is $450 a month.

Interest Rate on Car: 4.3%
Interest Rate on Home: 4.125% Conventional 30 Year Fixed.

We're truly blessed to have had the equity in our home that we did, we bought when the market was bad in 09' and sold when the market was high. I just want to make sure that we're doing the right thing and not putting good money after bad.

personalfinance,"Feel like I'm drowning in debt, could use some advice.","Hi everyone. Been having a stressful couple of months worrying about my financial status, and want (well, need) to do something about it. I've always been more of a spender than a saver, and it's currently biting me in the ass. Here is a current breakdown of where I stand. Apologies for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile.

25 years old

Income: $48k annual

401k: 8% contribution, employer matches 75% of contribution (now fully vested, have almost $10k here, with not much of an idea of how it works)

Debt:

Credit card #1: $2400, 14.24% interest; minimum payment ~$55/mo

Credit card #2: $3400, 12.74% interest; minimum payment ~$75/mo

Credit card #3: $450, 0% interest (deferred) until November (planning to be paid off by September, was an unexpected purchase of a dryer when we moved into our home and the dryer kicked it on the first day)

Car loan: $12k, 9.45% interest; minimum payment $325/mo

Student loans: $8k and $7.5k, both 6.8% interest; minimum payment $200/mo for both


I do own a home with my partner, and we split the mortgage, cable, and utilities evenly, my half being around $600. With my cell phone payment, my total monthly bills (without gas/food/entertainment) come out to about $1300 ($1400 with paying off the dryer), and my take home pay after taxes and 401k is about $2350. I have $350 of this going into savings accounts that I can only access with a physical trip to the bank (to try to stop myself from spending it) but I'm also hemorrhaging money where I shouldn't be (cigarettes, alcohol, random coffee shop trips, etc) so I end up breaking down and taking it out of the savings account anyway (currently have ~$800 between both, the direct deposit was just set up a few pays ago).

Basically what it boils down to, I've gotten myself into a situation that makes me miserable, and could use some tips on how to get out. I know it won't be a quick fix, and will take time and effort, but any suggestions would be helpful.  I guess my main questions are these.

I do have a degree that should be earning me more money, but also feel very secure and content in my current job and am afraid to leave. How much of a pay raise would be worth it to help knock down my debt? 

Are personal loans worth it? What is a typical interest rate? Would I be able to transfer my credit card, student loan, and car debt onto a loan to make an easier and possibly lower payment? Where are good places to look for these?

Is there another option for transferring my credit card debt? I've seen the chase slate card mentioned here a bit, 0% interest with $0 transfer fees, what kind of credit score would you need with this? I've tried refinancing my car through a credit union but been denied twice, which has also hurt my credit score with inquiries. According to creditkarma my score is around 650.

personalfinance,My loan provider has accessed my credit report without my permission on at least six different occasions.,"I have a loan with a reputable online lender. The original loan was for $2k or so, I've gotten it down to about $600 over the course of a year and a half. To preface this - I am not looking to get out of my debt. I have made every payment in full and on time, making extra payments when I can. I will be paying off the remainder of my debt - that's not the issue. 

About three months ago, I got an email from the loan company to refinance my loan. At the time, I was in a tough spot financially and started an application to refinance, but the application process ended up being too cumbersome, so I called corporate and had the loan application cancelled. However, it seems that they encountered website issues - every time that I would log in, I would still see the loan application asking me to complete it, weeks after it was cancelled. 

I called them again and they said this was a website error and to give it a week or two before logging in again. During this ""week or two"", I received three emails saying that the loan I applied for was denied, listing my current credit score and the factors involved. This was concerning, because I had cancelled my application and they recognized it was cancelled, and each email had a different ""application initiation"" date. 

I called them again. They said that every time I logged in, I was prompting the system to resubmit my application... but that didn't make sense, because I never even finished the application in the first place to submit it and because I hadn't logged in on any of the dates listed. They told me that this was not a hard pull and wouldn't hurt my credit. I explained that I was still uncomfortable with this and they assured me they were trying to solve the problem.

Fast forward to about a month ago. The ""loan application"" no longer appears on the website, so it seems to have really been cancelled, but I get another email saying *another* loan application was denied. To be clear - someone isn't accessing my account improperly, they checked to make sure my home IP is the only one that has accessed my account and they can't even see the ""applications"" that these emails are in response to. However, on my credit report, I can see each time they pulled my credit for the loans I didn't apply for. 

Today, I get another email that another application was denied. I'm fed up. They are continuing to access my credit report without authorization or permission from me whatsoever, and their incredibly unhelpful customer service means I don't know what to do.

Does anyone have any ideas of what I can do here? Again - not looking to get out of paying what I owe. Just want to know how to put an end to the rest of this.",finance,1435945406

personalfinance,"Newly self employed and in debt, what should I do with 401k?","My parent's were never really great at giving me financial advice. I've asked them in the past about these things, and they mostly aren't helpful at all. So you'll have to be patient with me if I ask any dumb questions and basically ELI5.

So here's my situation. I'm a 30 year old single male. As of the beginning of June, I have been full time self-employed (sole proprietor) with freelance type work. Prior to this, I was working part time at a job that had a good traditional 401k program. Over the years, I managed to get about $8000 in my account. But now that I'm no longer with that company, I'm unsure what I should be doing with this. My first thought was, ""Don't touch it! That's your retirement, dude!"" But then I hear things about rolling a 401k over into an IRA. So now I'm thinking maybe I should do this? But, then something else occurred to me, and it's that I'm currently in a pretty decent amount of debt. The student loan being the largest, but also the least amount of interest. But the credit cards are where I'm really hurting. I'm looking at about $19k in credit debt, split between 5 cards for personal expenses (rough couple years) and business expenses getting my own business up and running (at least the business expenses were tax write offs). It's about $11.7k personal and $7.5k business.

Now, just typing that number out is a very sobering and terrifying thing, and I'm well aware of the hole I've dug myself in. But I am taking steps to live more within my means. When I was busy working two jobs (part time employed and full time self employed) I would just go through the motions financially. Now that I'm 100% self employed and dependent on myself, I've finally taken it upon myself to get myself more financially sound. I cut my budget down, and I'm starting to pay off the largest interest rate card, a whopping 22.9% but only a balance of $1400. The rest of my card debt is around the 9-13% range. But when it comes down to it, my self-employment isn't exactly netting me a large salary. I've got a small amount saved up, and some definite jobs coming up that will support me through the summer into early fall and hopefully beyond. But it's not leaving a lot of extra money for building an emergency savings or paying off a significant amount more than the minimum payments of my credit cards.

So, coming back to the 401k, instinct tells me to not touch it, but it would seem to make better sense to use it to pay off a large chunk of the credit cards, start paying off the rest as quickly as possible, and then once that monthly burden is lifted and that portion of my income is freed up, splitting it between an emergency savings and reinvesting in retirement. Is this the right course of action? And if so, what the best way to cash out the 401k to minimize fees?

TL;DR - Newly self employed, $8000 401k from previous employment, $12000 personal credit card debt, $7000 business credit card debt. Should I cash out the 401k to pay off debt or something else? How do I adult?",finance,1435946821

personalfinance,"Considering separation from wife, how to afford it?","My wife and I have a very troubled relationship, so we're considering separation, and I'm trying to figure out how I can balance my budget if we separate.  Here's a sketch of my finances:

Post-withholding income: $6000-$7000/month (variable number of billable hours per week).  

Employment: I'm a software developer in a major city, earning at the high end of market rate for my specialty.  Increased earning is possible but would involve retraining and building a new work portfolio, probably would take several months to accomplish.  My wife does not have a job.

Monthly expenses, paying for two people unless otherwise stated:

$1500 savings

$1035 rent

$500 transfer to wife's account for shared groceries and her personal spending

$300 personal groceries (e.g. lunch at work, picnics)

$35 utilities

$35 internet

$140 cell phone ($100 me, $40 her)

$750 health insurance

$550 psychotherapy (me only)

$200 restaurant

$100 bicycle maintenance fund (me only, bike commuter so lots of wear and tear)

$200 public transportation

$50 Zipcar monthly minimum

$50 Car rental fund (for weekend trips)

$225 art studio rental

$75 gym membership

$50 drinks (coffee/alcohol/etc.)

$50 digital media (software apps/ebooks/mp3s)

$200 tools (electronics/hardware/art supplies)

$100 entertainment (movie tickets/museum fees/club cover/etc.)

$100 clothes

Total: $6210

I have an emergency fund with at least one year's expenses.

Flexible items like tools and entertainment fluctuate depending on my actual income.  I'm about to get a car as a gift, but the drop in public transportation/bike costs will probably be offset by cost of insurance/gas/maintenance, as it's a 20 mile commute each way.

Expense changes from separation:

+$1000 spousal support: I am my wife's green card sponsor, so I'm required by federal law to provide 
~$1300/month for her support indefinitely, $300 of which can be written off as her share of the health insurance.

+$150 personal groceries

-$40 cell phone

-$500 transfer to wife's account

Net expense change: +$610

That's the bare minimum, and I can probably make it up by making some significant lifestyle changes--cut the art studio and luxuries like restaurant/entertainment/etc, shop at cheaper supermarkets.  However, if I move out, my rent is probably going to increase significantly; we live in a rent-controlled 1-bedroom, and a studio apartment will cost at least $500 more per month, unless I'm willing to take a significant loss in neighborhood safety and/or commute time (which means an opportunity cost).

It's more likely that I will be the one to move out, as we're both on the lease at our apartment and my wife hasn't shown any interest in moving out.  I don't know how I'll make up the rent increase.

Looking at all of this, do you have any suggestions on how I should financially manage this separation?  Are there things that I'm obviously spending way too much on?  Should I go into my emergency fund and hope that I can get a higher-paying job before I run out of savings?",finance,1435955474

The $50,000 is assuming of course I can get a paid job and am not just kept as an intern. Would it be irresponsible save up to $65,000 and then use that as a down payment for a house? Then the monthly payments for a 30 year fixed mortgage be around $2800? This seems like just a bit more than the average rent in the city anyways. What am I missing? Will my age and relative lack of credit compared to a 40 year old mean my interest rates will be through the roof, therefore making the monthly payments in the $3,000 range? 

And in the case the economy crashes and I lose my job, we would have to sell the house at the bottom of the market. So we should actually save for a down payment plus a 6 month emergency fund first, correct? Anything else I should be thinking about?

Another note that might be important: my fiancé has a bachelors in philosophy and is currently a server/bartender. He earns $2,000-$2,800 per month. The majority of the down payment was given to him by his grandfather with the specific instructions that it be used for a down payment and for my engagement ring which we recently purchased (the rest is from my grandparents). He eventually hopes to get an office job maybe but is pretty happy playing music during the days and working at night. However, this could be detrimental for getting a good interest rate. 

You can probably tell my masters is not in finance. Anyways, we feel silly throwing money away on rent rather than investing it in a home. What is your advice reddit?

edit: missing words
edit 2: I want to say. I am not just jumping into a mortgage. I just want to know what point I have to be at financially so i can set some goals. Also, my fiancé and I have been together for 6 years but would definitely not go in on any large investment together if not married.",finance,1435956424
personalfinance,About to get swamped with money problems - is a private student loan a good idea?,"I'm currently making $2k/mo, and my wife and I are more or less living paycheck to paycheck with about $2k in the bank. My wife is going to college in another city soon, and that's going to incur some costs that we probably cannot handle. Unfortunately, we cannot live together once she goes to school because I am currently a grad student. She also cannot go to school locally for valid reasons. Her current loans and grants are at the max from the federal side. My question is if private student loans, such as from Discover or where ever a good idea... at least for the next 3 years until she graduates and gets a job?


Here's a breakdown of our current income and expenses:

+$2k/mo income

-$800/mo mortgage

-$400/mo vehicle loan (Only about $2k left on this car, have been paying it off for about 4.5 years now)

-$200/mo utilities

-$400/mo groceries and consumables

-$40/mo internet

-$80/mo car insurance

-$variable/mo other expenses like healthcare/car repair/car registration/taxes

When she goes to school, we will have anticipated costs of:

-$400/mo Housing

-$100/mo Travel (driving) to see each other

-$200/mo New car payment for her car (If she doesn't have the car, she will need to live on or near campus, which the housing prices go up dramatically, at least $200/mo for the same space)

-$150/mo Health insurance

Because I own a 2br home, one thing that we will be doing is trying to get a new roommate for me, so that I can earn a little in rent to offset this, but it will probably be about $500/mo. All in all, we would need about $100/mo in loans for the next 3 years to use for basic needs. But I'm hesitant because I know that you can get really shafted on private student loans. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice in this regard?

Let me know if you'd like any other details, too. Thanks in advance for your help!",finance,1435957567
personalfinance,"Fiance has 370K of student loan debt, have a question about joint filing regarding IBR.","My fiancé is a recent pharmacist grad with 400K of loans (almost all federal student) and max income potential of 120K pretax.  I am a medical resident with virtually no debt and much higher potential. I had scholarships from military service and other income during school.  We have a 2 year old daughter.  As you can imagine, I want to get married but am concerned about the consequences of this debt load. Potentially we could avoid legal marriage but that has moral and morale costs that may harm my daughter. If/when we get married it seems filing separately would potentially shelter us from the huge debt load until forgiveness sets in after her IBR runs its course, especially if she works part time.  However, there are many other benefits of filing jointly that we would miss.  This is my question:

Is it possible to file separately every year, then reapply to IBR with that tax return, then retroactively refile jointly within the 3 year window and get back all the other benefits we missed out on like ""child tax credits"" etc... and not reasonably expect any negative consequences.

* Trailing 12-mo Expenses: $11,629/yr
* Expected yearly savings: $21,677 (about 70% of post tax income)

http://i.imgur.com/CnpkLA3.png

I included a page in a spreadsheet I created to give you a breakdown of my income/expenses. I haven't updated it yet for June. The assumptions I used in my ""Years Until"" calculations are 

* constant spending (I will have to do something about health care expenses)
* 4% yearly growth in investments, compounded monthly
* 3% yearly growth in nominal savings amount, compounded monthly

The components of my net worth are 

* $22,447 in taxable brokerage account (40%)
* $24,260 in Roth 401k/Roth IRA (43%) (401K match has not kicked in yet so I have $0 in pre-tax retirement accounts)
* $5,000 in a Mango Money account (earning roughly $20 in interest a month, net fees) (9%)
* $5,489 in cash (10%)
* The total is above 100% due to credit card debt, which is not accruing interest

Additionally, my investments are as follows

* Roth 401K, $11,323 in S&amp;P index (100%) and 0.37% expense ratio
* Roth IRA, $6,600 in BND (51%) and $6,337 in VTI (49%)
* Taxable, $22.447 in VTI (100%)

Overall, in these three accounts, I am 14% bonds, 86% stocks, mostly domestic large-cap. (How much international exposure do you all have?)

&amp;nbsp;

My question to you FI, is how should I be allocating my savings between Roth and Traditional accounts. Right now, I am contributing 100% to Roth accounts because I am in the 15% tax bracket and I hope to increase my income steadily.

&amp;nbsp;

Should I continue contributing to my Roth while I'm in the 15% tax bracket? And then switch over to the Traditional? I believe if I contributed fully to Traditional accounts next year I could get my AGI low enough to have the Saver's Credit completely offset my federal tax burden, but I am worried about being so heavily invested  pre-tax retirement accounts.

&amp;nbsp;

Despite liking my job, I don't really enjoy working and hope to retire or partially retire around 40. But I have no idea what my life will look like in 5 years, let alone 20-30. I might be married with children, I might be single. 

&amp;nbsp;

So FI, what do you think? Do you have any general suggestions or recommendations for me? What do you think is the ideal mix of Roth and Traditional retirement accounts? 

&amp;nbsp;

I assume you'll probably tell me to invest fully in pre-tax accounts because of my low spending. My only concern is that, as a single individual, I can only offset $10k from my taxable income. The rest will be taxed at a minimum of 10%, which feels close enough to my current 15% marginal tax rate to say, ""Better safe than sorry."" If my income increases substanially, I may have a large taxable account also generating yearly income.",finance,1435968039

Claiming 0 exemptions. On the 6K, 1500 (25%) was withheld for federal tax, but on the 1856, only 264 (~14%) was withheld.

Now, from what I understand, withholding works by assuming the gross pay for the period remains the same for every period. So, at 6K per pay period, I would be at 144K a year, putting me at the 28% bracket, not matching the 25%. At 1856 per period, ~44K a year, 25% bracket, higher than the 14% withheld. If they used the 70K per year, thats still 25%.

As many others my age, I'm not in the best situation financially. I am looking to pay off my debt in the most efficient way and create a general plan for my future.


My current monthly net income is about $2764/mo without any overtime after the minimal retirement contributions, health insurance and state/federal taxes (single, claiming 2). I work for the government, and have a relatively stable income.


I currently have $400 in savings and $100 in checking to last me until I get paid next.


**Credit Card Debt:**

* Card 1 - $544 balance @ 26.99% APR ($35/mo minimum)
* Card 2 - $692 balance @ 25.24% APR ($25/mo minimum; 0% APR until 6/13/15)
* Card 3 - $2334 balance @ 16.24% APR ($60/mo minimum)
* Card 4 - $4941 balance @ 10.15% APR ($99/mo minimum)


**Loan Debt:**

* Bank Loan - $1537 balance @ 8.99% APR ($96/mo minimum)
* Auto Loan - $39286 balance @ 2.9% APR ($654/mo minimum) - yeah... i know


**Monthly Bills:**

* Cell phone - $65/mo
* Auto Insurance - $130/mo
* Gas - $400/mo
* Food - $400/mo
* Rent - $0


Using the budget above, I have $700-800/mo in excess income after making the minimum payments. My current plan is to save the minimum $1000 in my savings for an emergency fund, then pay off my credit cards in numerical order as I listed them above. I plan on using the excess income and applying that to the balance of the card that I am working to pay off at that time.


The issue I generally have is actually sticking to the budget plan that I create for myself. I currently work a job that I don't enjoy at all, and I have been interviewing for other positions for my current employer and also applied/interviewed for a local electrical union. I recently had a pretty bad substance abuse problem I went to an outpatient rehab for, and moved back in with my parents to help keep myself on the right path. The high stress job I currently have played a huge part in the substance abuse, so I am hoping to find another job that is less stressful and something I enjoy doing.


I live in California, so the cost of living on my own is pretty high in my area. Rooms for rent range from $450-$650, and apartments are $950-$1250+. I would like to move out of my parents house as soon as I am financially stable enough to do so. I plan on keeping my current vehicle for at least another year or two if I stay with my current employer so I don't lose out on the initial cost of buying a new vehicle. If I end up getting the other job for the electrical union I applied for, I will be taking about a $600/mo pay cut for the first year. I plan on getting a more economical vehicle with a lower monthly payment if I end up getting hired as an apprentice electrician as I will be commuting to various job sites.


Part of this is actually typing everything out so I have a plan, and to hopefully get some good advice on what to do. Any help would be much appreciated!",finance,1436006015

While the politicians can change taxation and other things effecting macro and micro economics, the central bank is supposed to make sure the monetary market is working.

I can't come up with any country in the world where the central bank wouldn't have made sure to keep the monetary system working, despite the political bankruptcy. For example, the city of Detroit was bankrupt. Many American banks in 2008-2011 went bankrupt.

I recently started a new job with a large company in New York.  I live in New Jersey.  After working at the company for a couple of months my office location was changed from New York to New Jersey, but I still have to work from New York 1 day a week.

I'm currently paying New York state taxes.  When I reached out to my company's HR department and asked if I need to change anything related to my state taxes due to changing my work location to New Jersey, I was sent a New York Certificate of Nonresidence and Allocation of Withholding Tax (IT-2104.1).  This form asked me how much of my time I spend in New York.  I indicated 20% since I am in New York 1 day and New Jersey 4 days.

It seemed odd to me that I didn't have to fill out anything else.  If 20% of my state taxes were going to New York, what was happening to the other 80%?  When I asked my HR department if there was anything else I needed to fill out (like a New Jersey tax withholding form), they sent me a federal W-4, likely by mistake since I didn't want to change anything having to do with my federal taxes.

I responded by asking them why they sent me a federal tax form to fill out again and they apologized and sent me a New York tax withholding form (IT-2104) and a New Jersey tax withholding form (NJ-W4) without any explanation as to which (or both) I needed to fill out.

I asked HR why I need to fill out another New York tax withholding form since I already filled one of those out when I started, and asked them to verify that all I needed to do at this point was to fill out the New Jersey form.  Radio silence.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?  I'm not certain my HR department understands what I need to do, and I don't want to run into a tax problem.  Any advice is appreciated.",finance,1436025673

You guys are an incredible community and though I've never posted here before, I've learned quite a bit just by lurking. So before we get to the heart of the matter, here's a little background on where I am financially: 

-I'm 25, I graduated from college in 2011, and since that time, I've been paying around $580 a month in student loan bills.

-My total debt as of today is $46,267, but I don't regret taking the loans out. I worked hard in school, enjoyed it, and I wouldn't have been able to afford to go otherwise.

-Thanks to the degree, I now work an entry level job in my field of study, making $15 an hour and working 40 hours a week. 

-I have a little over $6000 in the bank right now.

-My loans are serviced by 4 companies, but actually break down into 11 separate loan accounts (some private, some federal) with different principal amounts, interest rates and monthly payments. The details are as follows:

Now the numbers:
(listed by loan name, total due, interest Rate and monthly payment)

Federal Loan 1     $1,920.34		6.30%	$50.00

Private Loan 1     $7,896.03		2.18%	$65.32

**So**, considering my situation and circumstances, I think I want to fully pay off *Federal Loan 1* (the one at the top). My question to anyone who's bothered reading through this for me: is that a good idea? 

With $6000 in the bank, I think I could take the $1920 hit pretty gracefully. And that would mean $50 bucks more in my pocket every month. Plus it's one of my worst interest rates, which seems like a good idea (that's kind of the ""avalanche"" philosophy). However, I don't make a ton of money and I don't know if I should keep saving and let my bank account build a little bit more before I take a big chunk out. And if anyone's wondering about the 1A, 1B, etc, I can try to elaborate on that a little bit.

Anyways, I appreciate any direction, guidance or constructive thoughts. Thanks guys!

tl;dr I list all my loan amounts above, I want to fully pay off *Federal Loan 1*. Does that strike you as a bad idea?

personalfinance,"Student with no credit trying to build credit, continually denied for credit cards. Any recommendations?","Almost started this post the wrong way...gotta fix that.
HAPPY AMERICA DAY!

22 years young in NC, I have no credit at the moment and when I apply most of the time I see something like 'credit score not good enough' or 'not enough credit to qualify'. If there is a highly recommended card for people with 'bad' or 'no' credit, I've probably applied and been rejected (Chase, Capital One, etc.). Neither parent has a credit card so I'm pretty sure I can't piggy back by reporting their income. They didn't do very well with their finances, recently filed for bankruptcy, and went through a pretty financially demanding divorce (big whoop wanna fight about it). Neither parent makes over $50k/yr either, although I'm not sure what the actual number is. Pretty sure it's a good bit less. I'm sinking in federal student loans at the moment, but I'm still in school for one more semester so I would like to start a credit reputation before I graduate and shit hits the fan.  

I've heard that gas cards are a good place to start. I am pretty conscientious when it comes to my finances so I'm not overly concerned with a high APR - I am planning to pay the balance in full every month and use the card sparingly. Really the only purpose of this card is to help me START to build credit. I don't have an income at the moment but do various freelance web stuff for money for people that I may try to turn into a business venture when I have more time. AKA no real income to report. I do however have a joint credit union account with a parent and a personal checking/saving at Suntrust (if that's relevant at all).

My biggest concern is an annual fee. I really don't want a card with an annual fee, but I'm not sure I have a choice at this point. I don't know very much about the reporting processes of secured credit cards, but I would like to avoid having to invest a collateral amount if I can help it as well. I've seen some of these cards with like a $0 annual fee and 25% APR. I know that's dreadfully high, but it may very well help keep me in check with my usage of the card so I could live with something like that.

If anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them and thanks again.

EDIT: SunTrust does have a 'credit building' secured credit card with a minimum $300 deposit and I can't find whether or not SunTrust has an annual fee. They seem to be more in the business of helping provide credit cards to people with established credit than helping to build credit. Unless there is something I'm missing, I'm probably going to avoid suntrust for a first credit card.

Edit2: Took Mr. White's advice and reapplied on a whim for one I got rejected for (figuring it would happen again and I could just call later) but upped the income amount to reflect parental contributions and scholarships.

But this is taking too long.  The doomed dwellers take a long time to die and I have a vault to run. I mean, some of these women have been pregnant for like three years.  No wonder they keep showing up at the bar.

No choice but to to set up a kill room at the deepest levels of the vault.  I will lure unhappy, unarmed dwellers into this innocent looking Diner.  They tend to be young dwellers just out of being children that have no skills or place in the vault.  Its some sort of messed up Logan's Run sequel.  I will rush this room to exhaustion until everyone drops dead from Radroach bites and smoke inhalation.  The other dwellers don't suspect a thing.

personalfinance,"Car costing $2500 to fix, not worth it. Starting grad school in the fall. What's my best option?","So basically, I have an 03 Mazda that's going to cost me $2500 to fix. I don't want to put that money in the car because it's old and not worth it. Is it drivable? For now, yeah, but the mechanic said it's going to die soon. Am I insane for wanting to get a ""new"" (used) car? (I have **bolded** positive financial figures and *italicized* negative, if that helps any.)

1. I bought the car for $4500 in 2010. Put $2100 in it in 2013, along with regular maintenance along the way. Paid cash for everything, so no additional interest or anything paid. Have had my car since age 17, am 22 now. Bought car at 123k miles, currently sits at 171k.

2. Have about **$4000** in liquid savings right now--was planning on saving that for emergencies, but this sorta strikes me as an emergency so...

3. Have been approved for **$20,500** in student loans (over two semesters), which I could use to cover the cost of my car as I need the car to get to class and to my GAship. Student loans are unsub federal at 5.4% interest. Have also been given a zero-interest **$5,000** loan from my parents. Will have job that pays stipend of **$10,000** per year starting in mid-July. 

4. Expenses are as follows: 

**Monthly:** 
retirement funding, *$100*  
car insurance, *$300* (about; I live in Philly)  
renters' insurance, *$6*

**Half-yearly:** 
books, *$500*  
tuition, *$13,000*

No food or rent or utilities, as this is covered by the university for which I work. 



I'm looking at cars 2009 and newer, planning on spending around $8k. Reasonable? I also move in about 5 days, so I'm feelings a bit stressed.

Are some of these agencies less Politics than others? Is there a hierarchy of Politicsness among them? At which level do they become not politics?

In a way this is much like the question of archimedes ship, or Zorros Arrow, only with federal agencies, instead of fingernails and toenails, or the fourth dimension. Surely the government which all of these agencies and more together constitute is politics. Surely the president is politics. and contenders for the democratic and republican candidacy for presidency. We know that they, too, must be politics. And the budget which enables all of these programs is doubtlessly politics.

At what point in this hierarchy, beginning with Sen. Bernie Sanders, moving down through President Barack Obama, the Mayor of Springfield, and finally concluding at the smallest grain of sand on the most distant hawaiian shore, do things stop being politics? Is it at the municipal level? Does the definition of what is politics have a requirement that a decision or legislation affect a certain number of people? How many? Is there a threshhold of monetary cost or benefit at which a decision made by a government official becomes political, where it would not have been otherwise? What is that threshhold? Can there be any objective standard, in a well and throughly governed 
society, that serves to distinguish politics from.. whatever would be left? And Is there a name for that-which-is-not-political? Can we bring this back to a more organic Gaea hypothesis in which the wolf is equal to the sea-lion? Or is it just Bernies all the way down?

personalfinance,"Taking advantage of the slower traffic to share my difficult situation; 19 y/o in legal, financial and educational distress","Hello,

I have never posted in Reddit before, and frankly it never occurred to me to post on here, especially about my situation. I generally just browse. I do hope maybe someone out there has some answers to share. Thank you all in advance. Regardless, here in the gist of my situation, and after that a total breakdown. 

I am a 19 year old male living in New Jersey. I graduated last year from high school in the top 1% of my class from a rather reputable high school, with 35 college credits under my belt, national awards and some enticing offers to colleges, some which, from an academic standing, offered full rides. Since August last year, I've worked as a night time janitor, paid for and continue to go to community college to this day, worked as a facilities engineer in a hotel close to New York full time, moved out of my parents house at their suggestion, left the hotel and back to night janitorial, and now am temporarily living with a friend. 

In the meantime, I have been able to accumulate an over 700 credit score, have history with my phone company in order to be in a contract soon, and can graduate with an associates in Business Administration this winter. 

Why all this? I am a not fully undocumented immigrant. 

I was brought to the US at an early age and have been here 14 years this October. I went through most of my life here. Please, I don't need any hate for my status. I get it all sides. But I'm trying to survive. Don't hate me for that at least. In 2012 I was lucky to be able to receive DACA, which is deferred action for childhood arrivals, and am allowed to work legally, pay taxes for everything, and drive. It does NOT give benefits that I needed such as federal aid for school. 

I will break down other parts but here is a financial bit for those who do not want to continue reading: I have $800 right now in savings, a car I own, and clothes. I'm no schmuck; I have many unique and higher education experiences such as interning at town hall, experience in owning my own business, and real life work in various, various jobs. From hotel engineer to pizza maker. I've been going around looking for jobs that I can make decent money with because of the amount of money it will require me to get a degree. What should I do? I can't live with my friend here for too too long. My parents is not an option. Not because I don't want to, but that's another story.
Thank you for anyone that responds up till here.

In terms of the educational bit, in case anyone has any insight, I was offered full rides to a few colleges for my academic record and extracurriculars. My father walked out on my family 7 years ago now, and my mother does not have any legal documents, although my two younger, much younger brothers, are citizens. So yes, dirt poor. 

FAFSA rejects me every time I try to make it because my of my mom and my information most likely, and the colleges I contacted last year told me they needed it to make a correct offer for how much they would be willing to help me with. Free community college under this program known as STARS in NJ, although awarded to me based on high SAT and class rank, was also denied because of my status.

My mom has no experience with any of this, and being the oldest I was left to fend for my own. I did not know what to do last year. After the initial response from the colleges I spoke to, most around this area, I refrained from speaking to the ones who offered full rides. I'm not even sure if that was a mistake. I recently reached out to them again. But the let down of what took place as May-June 2014 came along, I withdrew and suffered a minor depression period seeing everything I had acquired be broken down. I understand I need an immigration lawyer and am working  towards set goal.

Strangers behind a screen, i need advice. Any advice. Because I want to go to school and get my education and work the way it was all supposed to happen. Like I said, this past almost year now has been pure hell, one that based on what I was worth and have the accolades for, did not deserve. 

Whatever it takes, I want to turn it all around.

Thank you.",finance,1436037453
politics,A Second Letter To The New Left,"As a political scientist, I feel compelled to write this.


In 1960, C. Wright Mills wrote what was called ""A Letter to the New Left"". A quote that will always stick with me, was:
""In the slum countries of the world today, what are they saying? The rich Americans, they pay attention only to violence — and to money. You don’t care what they say, Americans? Good for you. Still, they may insist: things are no longer under the old control; you're not getting it straight, American: your country — it would seem — may well become the target of a world hatred the like of which the easy-going Americans have never dreamed. ""

I'm writing a little note because  feel compelled to show people this. In 1960, Mills predicted anti-American sentiment. And in the spirit of July 4th and our modern day, I'd like to write a second letter, one much more brief. We have student loan interest rates that will forever enslave my generation. I personally know people my age who never pursue a college education because of the crippling debt and risk that comes with it. Public education is flawed, with no thanks to bureaucrats over-testing high schools, and a divided approach on how to teach in addition to outdated schoolbooks preaching inadequate material. In 2011, the President made a ""back to school"" speech that essentially said post-secondary education is a must. I agree; a high school diploma will not get you past construction and blue collar. If we are to have a high-functioning, wealth-generating economy, we have to empower people with the knowledge to procreate innovation and creativity. In a country where capitalism and innovation are championed, that only makes sense. There is a lot of research to imply that a low-to-middle class with  enough income to support themselves and go to school is good for any economy. It's time we stop talking about how tax cuts are good for corporations. Big business claims to help second and third world countries, but all the same chastise immigration from the border. This hypocrisy has to stop, as CEO's and chairmen and billionaires tell the working class how their greed is ruining the economy. 

In terms of military spending, I am something of a pragmatist. A Utopian country with no investment in national defense will not last long. Especially a country that has already gained the ire of other countries, as predicted by Mills. Bush raped the National Guard, a branch made to defend domestic lands, and used them overseas. We were attacked on 9/11 by Osama Bin Laden, whose demands, initially, were for us to pull out of Saudi Arabia. I ask you all to put yourselves in those shoes (horrible though that may sound). You live in the United States, and a Middle Eastern superpower has a military base planted squarely in your country with tanks and attack helicopters. They have religious figures that preach to those military troops and that teaching goes against your country's heritage. How long will you let that stand? This was the first unheard complaint that many do not know about in the United States. It's time we listened to our international neighbors, and gave our allies the privacy they deserve. This is not restricted to France and Germany, who have protested our embassies after learning we spied on them through the NSA and local military intelligence.

If we are to be successful in in reshaping our image as a superpower, we as Americans need to stop being hypocrites. We talk about values in privacy and yet camp in other nations' borders. We talk about equal rights, but still worship corporations that have done nothing for us. We talk about freedom, but oppress other countries with drone strikes. Wake up, the nightmare is real.",finance,1436037985

personalfinance,"Recent college grad looking to buy a car, can I afford 8-12k?","Lurker, first time poster, I have recently graduated (Dec 2014) and moved to CO. I am currently living with relatives rent free and would be able to continue doing so for at least another year, but I would like to move out on my own before that. I do not currently own my own car but have been looking to get one soon with 12k being the top of my budget, looking for advice on finances.

Current finances:

ATT family plan cells: $131, I would like to switch to Straight Talk but we are in the middle of the contract and the price to cancel the plan and pay off the phones would be 700+, so this is static at the moment.

Gas: $33 fills the tank of my aunt's car that I am allowed to drive.   Full tank lasts a week to a week and a half depending on who's driving where.

Student loans: ~$31k. First payment is Aug 9th, I am on an income based repayment plan, total due is about $89 a month for both loans. 3500 at 5.6% and ~27k at 4.5, with a .25% reduction on both rates for doing auto pay. I plan to pay 200 a month total for both, with more going to the higher interest rate loan. 

Credit: I have 2 credit cards, $1000 student card through a credit union 16% interest rate, paid on time every month, I carried a balance a few months but paid off, currently 120 on the card due date 7/24. $800 amazon card, no balance has been empty and unused for about 2 months now. 

Job: Accepted a new job and will be making $22.50 an hour, 40 hours a week. I start the 13th so I'm unsure what my take home after two weeks will be. My previous job I had been at for about 3 months, before that I held my college job for 4.5 years. 

Micellaneous: $100-250 a month, this is for various household items, food, toiletries, shopping, personal treats, pet food. 

As far as a car goes I would like a 2008-current small/mid size SUV with AWD and after tax/title/etc. would like to keep the purchase price under 12-13k and payments under $250 a month. I will be saving up 3k for a down payment. I tried to get an auto loan for a vehicle a week ago and was quoted 14% for an interest rate, I'm a first time buyer with a credit score of 663. That rate was through the dealership.

 
I could go through my credit union for a rate as low as 5.24% but my loan to value (what the car is worth, vs what I'm borrowing) has to be over 50% and then I would need to cover the rest. I'm a little confused on how that works but that is how it was explained to me, so I would qualify for a $5k loan on a 10k car because loan to value is 50%, then I would have to pay the other 5k. 

Insurance on cars that I've been looking at for my age and and area are between $145-175 a month for Geico, Esurance, and Progressive, the cheapest I've seen for total coverage (collision, comprehensive, liability)

With all that in mind, is a 12k or, ideally less car feasible on my budget? I don't want to saddle myself with too much extra debt but a car is a necessity for me currently and I don't want to drive around in a $2k junker just because I can pay it off. I would like a good car that will be in good shape and capable come winter time.",finance,1436044855

To start off, I am a 33 year old male. I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering. I spent a few years pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Engineering but did not successfully complete it due to low grades. I previously had a CCNP that expired in 2012. I have no girlfriend, no family and no relatives of any sort that I am currently in contact with.

I have a total of $100K in accumulated student loans from my degrees. I live and work in Socal as an electrical engineer. Salary is $60K, which from what I understand is the minimal get-by amount in this area. My line of work is in a very narrow field. It does not offer much growth potential in either position or salary, is unrelated to any other electrical field and I don't really care much for it either. I'm just trying to pay the bills and have no intention of making a career out of it.

I am able to steadily save some money every month (like $900-$1000?) but given my age I'm very worried about my future and am thinking I should plan ahead for a real career and maybe moving to another area, but I'm also completely lost as in what I want to or should do.

A couple options I can think of the top of my head. I can redo the whole Cisco certification thing and try getting into IT or switch directions completely and maybe try for a real estate license? I am quick at learning most types of new stuff minus programming, which I am only passable with at best. I've noticed from my current job I may be good at managing, although I don't think getting an MBA is a financial option at this point. Can someone point me in a direction to help kind of figure things out?

[Edit] Since someone brought it up, here are some estimated monthly expenses:

Net salary after taxes - $3200 /mo

Federal Loan - $300 /mo

Private Loan - $100 /mo

Room - $850 /mo all inclusive

Food - $500. I do hit the gym regularly and feel the need to eat well.

Car Payment (used car, owe a friend) - $100 /mo

Car Insurance - $80 /mo

Dentist (owed for previous service) - $90 /mo

Gym membership is negligible and no credit card balances. No other real expenses as I'm neither partying nor dating.

The first loan is my mortgage, which I owe $187,194 on. I'm locked in at an interest rate of 2.69% until 2020. I can double my currrent mortgage payments without penalty. 

The second loan is my federal student loan, and I owe $38,068. The interest rate is prime plus 2.5% which equals 5.35% at the moment. 

The third is my provincial student loan, and I owe $21,370 on it. The interest rate is 2.85%.

Because of the low interest rate, please correct my financial ineptitude if I'm wrong but I don't think paying down my mortgage makes the most sense right now. Obviously the interest rate on my federal student loan is much higher than my provincial.

I've never build a budget before. I'm providing my numbers below, to help give you some idea of whether I'm a hopeless paycheck-to-paycheck case, or maybe get an idea for whether I can start putting some real money away into savings. 

I've just accepted a **new job** (started on 6/22) and haven't got my first paycheck yet, so **I don't actually know how much I'm going to be making**. I'm in **Washington**, so I think I don't have a state income tax, but I should be at the 28% federal bracket. I'm a single filer, and my fiancee doesn't work (not a ""real"" job, per se, she has no income). 

Income: 125,000 per year (+$6,250 in bonuses that I'm not counting)

---

**Paycheck deductions**: 

* 28% off the top: Federal taxes
* 4% off the top: 401k
* 6.2% off the top: Social security 
* $500/mo: health, dental, etc.

(Am I missing anything here that people normally account for?) 

---

**Net monthly income**: 

((((125000\*0.72)\*0.96)\*0.938)/12)-500= **$6,253.60**

---

**Monthly expenses**: 

* $2,350/mo: Rent
* $200/mo: Electricity
* $150/mo: Gas
* $150/mo: Water/sewer
* $40/mo: Garbage
* $50/mo: Phone
* $30/mo: Netflix, Hulu, Spotify
* $400/mo: Car payment
* $200/mo: Car insurance
* $20/mo: Renter's insurance
* $250/mo: Paying off previous credit card balances (""credit counseling"" service)
* $80/mo: Internet
* $600/mo: Food
* $150/mo: Gas
* $500/mo: Emergencies and fun money

---

**Total monthly expenses**: 

2350+200+150+150+40+50+30+400+200+20+250+80+600+150+500= **$5,170**

---

**Delta** 

6253.60-5170= **$1,083.60**

---

Now obviously the ""$500 for emergencies and fun money"" isn't something I'll need each month, so anything of that that isn't spent, is saveable. 

I also know that $600/mo is a lot for food, considering that I'm only supporting my fiancee and I. The reason it's a lot, is because we're on KETO, which basically means a fuckload of steak, cheeses, fresh fresh vegetables, and so on - it's a very expensive diet. 

---

But anyway, I want to make a comprehensive budget that's easy to keep up on and keep track of -- and I want to track my spending over time, and find areas where I can cut back and where I have over-budgeted. The fact is, I'm not really entirely sure about how much I spend on what, on a monthly basis.

personalfinance,Graduated from medical school with $265K debt. Considering the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program versus paying the debt down aggressively. What is the COST of taking this risk in the event the plan dissolves?,"Working with a friend to figure this out.  Related discussions have been had, but we're interested in the NUMBERS specifically.

Summary: He has debt from medical school. He can pay it off quickly or enroll in the PSLF program. His wife makes enough to support them. No kids yet, but most likely within the next 5 years. What are the risks and benefits, by the numbers, of each decision?

Details: He has $265K in debt today. He will make $55K before taxes this year and have an approximate 2% salary bump over the next 4 years (5 years total). At year 6, based on today's numbers, he should make $220K +/- depending on setting, location, etc. He will have opportunities to make more or less, depending on factors that cannot be adequately predicted right now, but at least considered in the realm of opportunity.

Option 1: Enroll in the PSLF program now. If you are unfamiliar with the program, it is a program designed to forgive student loans for those who choose to work in a qualifying setting for 10 years and make payments that are calculated based on their salary. In his case, he will pay 15% of his monthly salary. His salary is calculated based on the previous year's taxes. The program started in 2007 and, since it takes 10 years, nobody has been forgiven yet. *There is and always will be the possibility that this program will changed or canceled without grandfathering those already onboard. This can happen without notice. This is the major risk with this option. Imagine making 9 years of minimum payments while accruing compounding interest, only to be left high and dry. I believe this to be a catastrophic possibility.

Option 2: Let the wife pay the bills. Continue to live frugally as he is accustomed to for the next 7ish years. Take 60-70% of his gross salary and start paying it down beginning with the highest interest rate loans.

Numbers:
Total Debt: $265K
Rate (weighted): 6.95%

Also, he can choose to enroll in the program for the 1st 5 years to bring down monthly payments and enjoy life. At year 6 he can take the highest paying job opportunity (not restricted to PSLF qualifying jobs) and start to pay the loans down in huge chunks. What is the financial cost of this decision?

Im 23 years old and live in Southern CA. I recently was hired as an Air Traffic Controller for the FAA and passed initial training and was placed at a busy facility in Palmdale. My starting pay is $48k, but that will go up incrementally as I complete training. Around September, I should be making $75k, hit $95k this time next year, and sometime around 2 years from now I should be fully checked out and be making around $135k/year. 

I have never made this much money in my life, and have no real idea what to do with it. I have all the basics covered...I have 0 Debt of any kind which is fantastic. I own a car, and am renting a 2 Bedroom apartment for $1200/mth, and I rent out the spare bedroom for $500, so my actual rent works out to be more like $700/mth plus Utilities.

The FAA participates in the TSP program, which is basically a 401k but for federal employees. I put 9% of my checks away into the Roth TSP option, and have that money all invested in a fund targeted for a 2050 Retirement. The Match on the TSP stops at 5%. 

I have a Roth IRA with Fidelity with about $12k sitting in it. Its preformed horribly...I've lost 1.6% on it since I invested in mid 2013. The fund I am in is a Targeted 2055 Retirement fund, and Im not sure exactly what I should be doing differently. I wanted to roll it into my TSP, but they don't allow Roth IRA's to be rolled in. 

Otherwise, My savings account has about $25k in it, and I keep around 1-2k in checking. My question is pretty much...what am I supposed to be doing with all this money? Every check I take home around 1100, and try to put 300 a month into my Savings account. I haven't been putting money into my IRA recently because Ive been discouraged at how poorly its preformed. Im just kind of overwhelmed because I have very limited knowledge of the stock market or investing, and Im hesitant to risk all the money that Ive worked so hard to acquire. But at the same time, Im concerned that Im wasting money by just having so much siting in a savings account accruing near 0 interest.  

Air Traffic Controllers are forced to retire at 56 so I am also a little concerned about that. We currently are supposed to get a Pension Plan that would likely pay me somewhere around $56k a year in retirement money. But I'm not banking on that being around when Im ready to retire.

Any tips or ideas on what I can do with my money to make it go farther? The dream is to someday be able to put a down payment on a house in Palmdale/Lancaster which is considerably cheaper than LA itself. I basically don't know what I should be doing with my money...Nobody ever really goes over what to do once you make it.

personalfinance,"Just received my first job, but I am confused about the logistics","So, I need some help with retirement accounts, taxes, and budgeting. There are quite a few questions so thank you for the help in advance!

I will be living at my parents home in Florida. My yearly salary is $50,000. I get paid biweekly at $1,923.08. I receive 12% of my salary into a sepa as well as health and life insurance. I also have around 20k in student loans. 

**Retirement**

Concerning my sepa account, do I set up my own traditional IRA through a broker like Vangard or does the company create the account for me? Since it is an employee sponsored plan, are the contribution limits the same as a 401k or are they the same as an IRA as the name would indicate?

**Taxes**

Since I am starting this job part way through the tax year, do I get taxed in the tax bracket only for the income I received this year? 

How do I know what will be withdrawn from my paycheck so that I can plan my budget ahead of time? My understanding is that medicare, social security, and marginal taxes will be withdrawn (no state income tax, hallelujah). In a normal year can I simply find my income tax, social security tax, and medicare tax and divide by 26?

Also, I have a hard time understanding the W-4. For instance, I am plan to get the student loan deduction of 2,500. Can I use the W-4 to plan ahead for this and put that saved money away earlier? I really only see my self-exemption as an example for allowances. An elaboration on the W-4 would be fantastic. 

Both my parents and I have student loans that we will be paying together. So, when budgeting we will be keeping interest rates low with minimal payments, paying off capitalized interest, and paying off the high interest loans first. Do only payments towards student loans under my name go towards the deduction? Does my father receive a reduction for paying off his loans?


**Budgeting**

My parents are very generous and want me to have a good start. My food expense and initial clothing expenses will be covered. I have around 3k in the bank right now and since I am living at home with car and health insurance is that a reasonable emergency fund while I pay off my loans and invest in my IRA?

I understand that paying off loans is automatic ROI, but do not understand how IRA products work. Do they have some sort of guaranteed ROI that may make them more attractive than low interest loans? 

So, I suppose I will lay out my expenses, considerations, and priorities. Do these seem okay?

&amp;nbsp;

Monthly Expenses:

Car insurance ~ $50

Phone ~ $50

Gas(Bi-weekly) ~ $50

&amp;nbsp;

Considerations:

Are there stipulations on loans that effect my interest rate?

How do my father and I maximize tax deductions?

What are my IRA investment options?

How soon do I plan to move out?

&amp;nbsp;

Tentative Plan/Priorities:

1. Set aside enough money to cover monthly expenses.

2. Satisfy minimal payments for loans.

3. Maximize tax saving on personal loans(for year).

4. Contribute towards IRA

5. Highest interest loans between my father and I.

6. Pocket $50 to $100 dollars for fun.


**Investing**

Along with understanding general concepts/strategies I would like to look into Fundamental and Technical analysis. Does anyone have suggestions on where to start?

Thank you so much for the help!

personalfinance,"18, Intimidated by Debt and Career Choices","Hello Reddit! 

I just turned 18 a couple weeks ago and consider myself to be very conscientious of my future. I'm currently planning to obtain a Business Management degree as I've found the inner workings of business to be intriguing. I also have a great interest in computers and also plan to learn programming wherever I can. I enjoy the concept of building/creating. I personally believe, in the wisdom of my current 18 year old self, that I will be be able to use the Business Management degree to create better career pathways while using my knowledge of computers/programming to maintain flexibility in what I want to do. 

That being said; to attend College will cost me roughly $23k a year. I will be taking on the debt myself, but my parents will do what they can to help. I will max out the Stafford Loans each year, take the grants and scholarships from wherever I can, and use private loans to cover the rest. Right now I have been approved by Citizens Bank for a $14,000 loan that sadly has a 11.75% fixed interest rate. (A byproduct of not having a credit history) Without getting down to the gritty specifics it looks like my debt is going to be somewhere around $80k when I graduate. I do plan on putting the loans in deferment, choosing fixed, and stretching the length to 15 years. This way I can throw as much money at that number as I can during school without being required to pay when I can't. As for the 15 years, it will allow me to have a lower minimum payment just in case. (I plan on paying extra payments as much as humanly possible)

With all that being said, is the Business Management degree worth it? I'm definitely getting a degree no matter what, but should I switch to Computer Science or Information Systems Technology? I read that some programmers and technology based careers don't even require a degree as long as you're portfolio is great. This is the rationale behind getting a more generalized degree to allow me to do more, instead of getting a degree in a field that doesn't exactly need one.

Basically I'm intimidated by the future. I've always listened to my elders and held them as people who really do know what they're talking about. I always see ""I should have done this or that"" and I take that to heart. I try to learn from those before me. Taking on $80k worth of potential debt (hopefully turning out to be less or more like $60k, I need to go over my finances again) is a scary proposition, but a seemingly necessary one. Neither of my parents went to College, so I'm not in constant contact with those who have. 

Thank you for reading this if you've made it this far. I'm really just having a brain dump at 2 AM and need guidance. I have probably been all over the place, but the anxiety of being in debt is pretty crushing, and I just need some motivation.

To sum it up:
Business Management vs Computer Science/IST as a Major the other as a Minor
AND
Is $80k worth of debt really that scary? It just seems like a immovable mountain.

tl;dr I'm 18, getting worked up over probably nothing, and need some guidance.",finance,1436074963

personalfinance,My finances in a nutshell - am I on the right path?,"Hello Reddit,

&amp;nbsp;

First, thank you for your time and input, it means a lot to me...

&amp;nbsp;

I'm 32 years old and have a stable job in the high-tech industry - but I feel like I'm living paycheck to paycheck. I make about $80k per year after being with my employer for the last 10.5 years (started off at around $40k).

&amp;nbsp;

I recently just hit my goal of $100k in my 401k which made me happy, but other finances are making me think I'm not in a good spot. Currently I have $103,332 in my 401k and put in $415.27 per paycheck (biweekly). My employer has an annual increase program and I set it to increase by 2% every year (I think I'm currently at 15%).

&amp;nbsp;

I have about $7k in credit card debt that's currently at 0%, and transfer it to another 0% card when the term is near ending. This $7k is made up of (1) student loans that I paid off that were at very high interest rates (5-7%), and (2) some debt from Bitcoin mining that didn't go so well. I pay as much as I can on this (about $250 a month) after paying my monthly obligations.

&amp;nbsp;

I own about 15 bitcoins worth around $4k currently, and really not sure what direction bitcoin could be going in.

&amp;nbsp;

I only have one outstanding student loan that was consolidated long ago from my first college degree. It started out as $16,314.73, my payment is $112.78 per month, and I currently owe $7,527.62 left at 2.625% fixed.

&amp;nbsp;

I own a townhouse that I paid $210k for back in 2006 on a 80/20 5-year interest only ARM. I have only been able to pay down $6k on my house since 2006 due to paying interest only for so long. My interest rate is really low (since it's now in the adjustable period and the interest rates are low right now), and so are my payments. My 1st mortgage is $167,132.00 @ 2.75% adjustable with an interest only payment of $383.01, and my 2nd mortgage is $36,807.95 @ 7.125% with a payment of $281.50. I have only been paying the minimums since purchasing this house in 2006. The housing market sunk 2 years after I purchased the home and my house lost about $80-$90k of its value. Recently, houses near me that are very similar to mine have sold for around $180k so it looks like I have made some of that money back, but I'm still under water by about $20-$25k currently.

&amp;nbsp;

I currently save $200 per paycheck (biweekly) into a savings account to pay for property taxes at the end of the year (property taxes run about $2.3k), and for my own personal savings. My savings right now is only at $1.2k as I had to use some money from my savings to pay off a large airline ticket I purchased for my mother. My intent from this point forward is to NOT touch this money unless it is an absolute emergency and/or for my property taxes.

&amp;nbsp;

I have about $3k in stock from my employer and currently put 5% of my paychecks into my employers stock purchase program which buys stock at a 15% discount. I should have another $2-3k in stock within the next 30 days. I also plan on NOT touching this unless absolutely necessary.

&amp;nbsp;

My car was purchased for $30k and I put down about $12k when purchasing it back in 2013. I currently owe $7.8k and the car is worth $24k private party per kbb. My monthly payment is around $260 per month but pay $350 per month on it and am currently two months ahead on payments.

&amp;nbsp;

I own a business that I run on my weekends (from my home) and it currently has $7k in the checking account. I occasionally buy things that are for myself from my business account (which I know I need to stop doing). I have yet to pay myself through my business at all - other than to purchase things here and there that I want.

&amp;nbsp;

Both my sister and parents have run into financial problems that drained my savings account twice. The first incident drained my $8k savings account and put me in $5k credit card debt. The 2nd incident was for about $15k in total checks sent to my parents. I have since stopped sending them money and said that I need to work on my current financial situation.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
What does my situation look like?

&amp;nbsp;
How can I improve?

&amp;nbsp;
What am I doing right and wrong?

&amp;nbsp;
What should I be concentrating on?

&amp;nbsp;
Am I being overly worried?

Roll to Roth IRA, or use to pay off car loan and start emergency home fund?","Hi Reddit, forgive me if this is a previously covered topic.  I recently left my employer to take a better position elsewhere (little more pay but better benefits and growth opportunities). I start my new job almost immediately after this one ends, and my new employer has only a 90 waiting period before I can start my 401k. Both employers match the first 3% and matched 50% of the next 2%. Not sure how necessary this background info is, but I thought it'd help with my question.

This morning I checked my 401k report for June, and right now my account is valued at $3700. Presently I have a Roth IRA and I have already met about $4500 of my annual $5500 contribution (presently there's $10,300 in it). Normally I would roll everything over, but I have a unique situation:

I have a 2011 sedan that was a college graduation present from my parents, and the car in my father's name. They make the loan payments (which is in both mine and my father's names) but I pay for servicing, as well as insurance which is $1300/yr. When I called the financing company this morning, the remaining balance of the loan is a little over $2500. Now, my fiancé has USAA for insurance and they can allow me to bring my car under his policy now since we live together, and the insurance would be roughly $800/yr for the car, maybe a little less.

My question is this: Should I cash out my 401k and after the taxes, use it to pay off the car loan, which could allow me to re-register the vehicle to my name and take advantage of the cheaper insurance? 

Another thing is that my fiancé are looking to buy a house in the next 6 months. We have a sizeable downpayment available and right now we're looking at smaller starter home, and our credit scores have allowed us to get lower interest rates. If there's any amount left from the 401k it would start an emergency fund, and the money I could save with having the car paid off and insurance rates lowered would help with mortgage payments.

personalfinance,Lost my job and just found out we have $90k in credit card debt. Desperately need advice on my options.,"The facts are:

1) I only recently found out that my husband has been secretly building up $90k in credit card debt.  He was paying just the minimum until he could no longer do that and I found out when a card was declined. It includes medical debt for our kids. He was helping his mother out without my knowedge. Some of it was just wasteful spending. He's always paid the bills, and in 24 years we have *never* carried any debt before other than a mortgage, not even a car loan. Our credit rating is fantastic.  So believe me when I say I had *no* idea.  

2) I recently went back to school after being a stay at home mom and got a degree but lost my first job within 3 months. I've been applying like crazy for 6 months now with no luck. It doesn't help that I'm older and haven't really worked in 15 years. I am now working 55-60 hrs a week in retail while I'm looking, but even with those hours, the pay is not close to what I need to make a dent in that debt.  

3) Our kid starts college in a month and we were counting on my income to help.  We don't have the down payment for her tuition.

4) Husband refuses to declare bankruptcy because he is proud and says ""it's only money"" and that I will find a better paying job and we can pay it off if I put all my income to it in the next few years. Apparently, he thought our income would double when I graduated and so he just started spending it ahead of time.

I'm very depressed, very angry and at a loss on what to do.  A bankruptcy attorney said that if he won't file, my only option is divorce.  I've even considered it because our marriage hasn't been great for a while, but even if I did, I don't have enough to live on and support the kids.  I have no family to live with. I'm overwhelmed, depressed and feel myself sinking into this dark pit and have no idea how to get out.  The job loss was hard at middle age and not finding work was harder, but now with this debt and my marriage crumbling, I have no idea where to begin.  

I know I should have been aware of our finances but after 24 years of penny pinching, I never thought to be suspicious.  I would appreciate any advice.  

EDIT:  Thank you all for the kind advice.  Your comments and PMs have been really supportive and helpful and have given me some ideas on where to proceed.  This is a great group of people!

For those of you who have asked for more detail:  

* We paid $210k for our home.  We owe $110k.  The equity took a dive during the recession and our home is now only valued at $175k.  I will look into selling or a home equity loan.
* The 401 is in his name and is worth $180k.  We are in our mid50s.  
* We don't have any stocks or other liquid assets beyond about $1k in our savings. 
* My kid has already gone to community college for a year.  She's pursuing a STEM major and should be employable.  She would not be eligible for military service due to her health.  
* Most of the medical debt is already on the credit cards.  We have $6.5k remaining that is not on the cards.  I've contacted the hospital but they say we are over the financial cutoff to be eligible for bill reduction.
* I am going to call the credit card companies and see if we can negotiate a lower interest rate. 
* And, yes, I should have been more aware.  The cards are cut and I am in charge of the finances.  I have set a strict budget.  I will look into everyone's suggestions.  I appreciate the advice.",finance,1436114015

$250 in checking, $1000 in savings in a Citibank account. Don't know the interest rate on my savings, but it doesn't really matter with only $1000 in it. I have a debit card I use occasionally (not credit).

EXPENSES:

Insurance for 1994 Jeep Cherokee: I pay $50 per month out of the ~$100 it costs, because I often drive my sister around and myself to work, so my parents offered to split it with me. 

Gas for 1994 Jeep Cherokee: I don't know how much this will be. I got the car yesterday, and it gets around 18 MPG.

Maintenance for 1994 Jeep Cherokee: At 102,000 miles, last week, it had about $2500 in maintenance done by my uncle who gifted it to me. New tires, fluids, alternator, and other miscellaneous small repairs. I'm not worried about much maintenance yet, and parts are cheap for this car.

Girlfriend: I have a girlfriend, and we love to go out to eat. I'd say twice a week at $10 a piece. 

College: I plan to attend SUNY Binghamton's School of Management starting in fall of 2016 for their 5 year MBA program. At approximately $22,000/year (before financial aid), it's quite an expense. My family has $40,000 in savings for my tuition, room, and board. My family's income decreased drastically a couple of years ago when my dad lost his job. There is a possibly of need-based as well as merit-based aid (I had very good test scores).

personalfinance,"Unemployed soon &amp; need to shrink cashflow: sell car ($47k owed, worth $42k at best) or not?","**My situation:** Living together with my girlfriend in California. We own a house (which we're selling). I'll be unemployed soon (my choice) and we're moving out of the area due to high cost of living. Looking at our budget, other than housing costs (which we're addressing), our next biggest expense is car payments. She owes $426/mo, and I owe $751/mo. We have substantial savings, so it's more about arbitrarily minimizing cash flow -- we don't have our backs against the wall...I just want my decision to be unemployed to have as minimal an impact on our finances as possible.


**The car:** I financed a Jeep Grand Cherokee back in February, total cost including sales tax in California was $50,220. I put 100% of the sales price into the note, so I'm actually paying interest on the sales tax...not here to be judged on that decision though. The current balance of the loan is $47,005 and according to KBB I can trade the car in to a dealer for about $40,500 or sell it third party for about $43,000. Interest rate is 2.49%, which will effectively go down to 1.99% after 12 months of on-time payment. Can't remember if it's a 60 or 72 month note off the top of my head but considering the interest rate at the time didn't vary between the two, I think I chose 72, for what it's worth.


**The dilemma:** If I sell the car, buy something more in line with my gf's payment (about $20-25k / $500/mo) and save about $4,000 a year in car payments. But I effectively have to foot the sales tax bill to the tune of $4,500 if I'm lucky and $7,000 if I'm not. The asset itself is not substantially underwater, if at all, which is why I'm on the fence about this decision. I'm in finance, so it should be an easy one, but since it's my money and a lot of it, there are more emotions going into this than an excel spreadsheet can capture...

*FWIW* I'm 31/M and by ""substantial savings"" I mean $400k liquid non-retirement and $200k in equity in our home that will be liquid soon. I guess ""substantial"" is a relative term...;-)",finance,1436118600

personalfinance,"~$45k in student loans, ~$33k in stock, what to do?","I graduated from school in 2013 and have been working in the tech industry since finishing up school. I love my job and my career, but unfortunately, due to some financial mismanagement by my parents (and general inexperience on my part) I was forced to take some fairly high interest loans to be able to stay in school.

That decision--to stay the course and finish up my degree--is paying off now in terms of my career. However, in the present I have almost $1,000 in monthly loan payments. Some of these are at 5% interest; some are at 6.95%.

I discovered recently that I have what now comes out to ~$33k in Disney stock that my grandfather purchased for me in the early 90s. This stock has performed really, really well, and I fully expect that it'll continue to keep pace ahead of inflation.

With all of this in mind, here are my primary questions:

1. What are the tax implications of liquidating my stock and using it to pay off my highest interest rate loans? How can I mitigate my losses from taxes?

2. Knowing that I can pay off all of the 6.95% loans and a big chunk of the 5% loans, should I sell my stock now to pay off those high interest loans, or leave it alone? (obviously this depends in part on the tax question above)

3. Is there anything that I absolutely SHOULDN'T do?

We have a dual income house with $4500 leftover every month (after paying minimums on our debt, plus all other bills and budgeting for food, etc.) We want to pay down our (ok, my) consumer debt. (Student loans exist, but are a non issue since interest rates are so low. I'll tackle those another day.) Here's what that looks like:

*Consumer loan: $40k (12%)

*Credit card 1: $11k (17%)

*Credit card 2: $17k (15%)

*Car: $27k (3.75%)


In what order should we pay these off? We've done the math and know how long it will take to pay them off -- about until the end of 2017, unless we get bonuses/raises/huge tax returns in which case that will go towards the payoff (unless someone has a better idea on that.)

We have a 72 month loan and our monthly payment is $386.  Right now we owe $19,000 on the loan and Kelly Blue book says its worth about $15,000.
 
I don't think our credit has improved much since we bought the car.  Maybe a few points.  We haven't started trying to address our score until very recently. 
 
What's the best way to handle this?  Should we try to pay a couple hundred dollars a month and then try to refinance in 6 months or a year?  Is it possible to get right side up?

Only about 13k in savings but maxed out 401k and Roth for last 3 years so not blowing all my take home. 

Found a house in my dream area, small town type place with very wealthy demographics. Most recently sold house is a 2 bedroom 1 bath that sold for 339K, other recently sold goes far into the millions. 

This house is 4 bedroom 2 bath on about the biggest lot in town (1 acre) .3 miles from the bars. Found it in pre forclosure and located the owner. Story is mom died, and the house died with her. The current owner cannot make payments, bank is gonna take the house. Owner has no problem letting me take the house instead of the bank. 

I can afford to take over the current loan no problem, and was planning on taking the renovations slow and paying cash for everything as I go while living with my parents. Only problem is I found out the city has an ordinance where if I start a renovation it has to be done within 12 months. 

House is a total gut, which doesn't bother me, I've worked on houses all my life as my family always pitches in when a member moves somewhere plus my parents own a rental house which we've gutted and restored twice in my lifetime. I'm also an in house engineer for a major developer so I have unlimited free consulting and materials at cost. Even with all that though I have renovations estimated at 80k with a contingency, should be able to come in under 60k. I don't have that cash to complete in under 12 months. 

I've looked at the FHA 203k and the whatever the FannieMae version is called which i'm not fond of on account of the third party contractor and consultant that is required which will take the renovation to an estimated 120k. 

I've also looked at various personal loans and home equity routes which are complicated and have high interest rates. 

Are there any options i'm missing? Do you think this is even possible for me to pull off? Should I just stop?

personalfinance,Penalty for paying off car loan early?,"Hey everyone,

I recently purchased a used car (2011) from a dealership.  

I originally planned on paying 10k cash, and financing the remaining 6k thru a loan. When going over the loan, I asked if there was any penalty for paying, and was told yes, 150 dollars. Additionally, the calculated interest of the loan would have still been due no matter how fast I payed off the loan. Combined with the APR they quoted me at, it would have cost like 1000 dollars to do this loan, even if I payed it off the next week. So I decided to pay for the car all in cash. 

Questions:  Are these stipulations normal, or were they trying to bilk me at the last step? Additionally, the credit score they quoted me at was over 100 points lower than anything I had seen before, including when I was applying for a home loan. Do dealers ever mess with credit scores too, to justify a higher interest rate ?

For context, I am a 27 year old, white collar worker and studied Economics, but I think they thought I was still a college student. I was also alone.

Not to gripe too much, but I had a horrible experience at this dealership; they made me wait 2.5 hours to talk to the finance dude who handles payments, after I agreed on a price with the sales manager. I walked out in frustration, but came back the next day after they agreed to sell me the car at the original price I offered.",finance,1436144322

I don't know where to go to choose a nice Roth IRA. I already have an account with TradeKing (no investments on it yet) but I'm willing to switch to a different provider if someone else offers a better fund. I've heard Vanguard and T. Rowe Price are good, but I really don't even know how to start researching them. In other words, I don't really know what I'm looking for when it comes to choosing a fund. I'm not too worried about risks as long as the fund has good management, so I'm looking for high-ish interest rates.

personalfinance,New student loans to replace old student loans,"I have an interesting question to ask that I could not find an answer for before. I currently have $40,000 in federal student loans that I took out to get my master's degree a few years ago. All of the loans are fixed at 6.8% and are currently in deferment. I am currently working on my PhD and have all of my tuition and expenses covered by my employer. Even with everything covered, I am still eligible to take out federal student loans each semester, for approximately $10,000 a semester. 
Since the current rates are approximately 1% lower for new loans, would it be smart to take out the new student loans and use the money to pay off the old student loans so I would have student loans at a lower interest rate?

I have $28,500 in student loans. The vast majority are at 6.8%. I only have a few that total $1691 that are at 2.3%. On standard repayment right now because I'm not eligible for any income-based repayment. About $400/month split between my two loan providers.

Recently we purchased a home through a family member in which we got a fairly killer deal. Last assessed tax value was 233k, we purchased for 153k @ 4.2% fixed. 

Would it be a bad idea to get a home equity loan to kill this student debt in one swoop? I would have about six to seven more years of repayment at the current terms on my loans. I figured maybe a home equity loan could work if I can get a rate at or lower than my current 6.8% on the loans.

I have just acquired a new (slightly) higher paying job,
and want to know what is the best way to save/handle/spend
the extra income (An additional $800).

My income with my new job is $3200 monthly (after taxes).
I pay $1200 in bills (rent, gas, insurance, cell phone, student loans, credit card debt from dental work).
I currently am in the habit of putting $1000 in my savings account each month. 
My personal extra allowance was $200, but I intend on increasing that number to $400. 

That leaves me with an extra $600. 

3200 income 

(1200) Bills

(1000) Savings

(400) Personal Allowance

600 of money left over 



The four options I can think of are

1) Put this money into my savings account as well.
Drawbacks: Won't really accumulate interest or do anything other than sit there.

2) Pay off Student loans in bigger chunks.
Drawbacks: The student loans  I currently have are federal loans and the interests rates are between 3 and 6.8%. If in the future I decide to go to go to school/complete school, and can't afford the schooling outright, I might have to take out a private loan with a high 10%+ interest rate, which I wouldn't have to do if I saved the extra income in the first place.

3)Pay of Credit Card debt early. I really see no incentive in doing this as my current card has no interest for the first 12 months. Paying it all off now vs over the course of 12 months won't save me any money long term.

4) Roth IRA? I don't currently have one, but maybe I should get one?

personalfinance,"Putting all my chips on me. 28K student loans, 92k retirement. Requesting advice on reboot plan.","Be me. 38 year old single male. 

Spent the last 6 years cobbling together a bachelors degree in Economics. Along with the pride and knowledge, I also have the 28K Federal debt (6% interest) wounds to show for it. Ouch. Fortunately, I somehow managed to build up a 92K FRS (Florida State Retirement) account. That at least makes me solvent.

I recently closed up shop on life in Florida, sold almost all my material assets and took up teaching English to adults in SE Asia at a very customer oriented school. I needed to brush up on my personal skills. $1,300 monthly income. $900 monthly expenses. $400 student bill. It's tight.

My real dream all along has been to be the first in my family to get a graduate degree, and to become a flat-fee CFP. To get there, I'm eyeballing the liquification of most of my retirement in order to knock out my debt and pay for a solid CFP/graduate program.

Reasoning: 
(+)
I want my younger years to intersect with capital and risk taking. I cannot do that if I'm living meagerly while all non-essential spending goes to debt repayment for the next 6 years. I believe in myself. I want to live debt free and have the freedom to make investments. I've done my due diligence on the career track. If I succeed, there is income potential for recovering.

(-)
I lose 40% of whatever amount I withdraw. I of course miss out on the compound interest that would have been accumulating while I build back up to 92K and beyond. I also miss out on two years income while I go back to school full-time. It's a HUGE hit, I know. 

I have yet to crunch potential numbers on where each track could end up 20 years from now, but actually I'm thinking with my gut right now and was hoping to hear some thoughts.",finance,1436195103

personalfinance,Best card for a college student?,"I'm 22, will graduate college in May 2016. While I won't have student loans to pay off, I will be financially independent and will need a credit card (currently I use my debit card or my parents take the amount out of my account when I order something online).  I don't care about interest rate, I will pay it off in full every month. I would prefer no annual fee (or very low if it offered great benefits).  Most of my purchases are on amazon (some other retailers, mostly computer stuff/cameras/clothes) or at restaurants and grocery stores (I'm pretty sure I spend more here compared to online shopping). I was considering a cash back card, like the capital one quicksilver, so that I could save a little on purchases I am already making. My mother said I may want to consider a travel rewards card, because some offer deals at restaurants, or the rewards may be better (more value per dollar as miles vs cash) with the caveat that the rewards can be limited. I know some cards have signing bonuses (a few I looked at had something like $100 back on $500), and I'm looking to sign up asap. Any suggestions are appreciated.

Do I have any power to have them refund me their service fees?,"I went to see someone in their local office and brought everything I needed including W-2s, 1099s, HSA information, charity donations and student loan interest statements. The person who I worked with was old and slow, but I assumed it was just a learning curve with the system. I had the appointment and then didn't hear from them for days until I called and complained, then the returns were officially filed.


They were correct on my federal refund, which I did receive. I was told because I was a New York and a New Jersey resident in 2014 that I had to file two returns for NJ, one as an in-state res and one as an out of state res. (My job which I had the entire 2014 was in NJ) Here is where things go wrong.


They told me I owed NY, which I promptly paid ~$500. A few weeks later I get a check in the mail from them for $300, I overpaid. They told me I'd be getting two refunds from NJ, I received the first one as an in state resident for $200 ish and have been waiting on the second half. I filed in February and still to this point had not gotten the second check estimated at $160.  


This week, I get a bill in the mail from NJ saying I owe $275. Something was clearly done wrong. Secondly, why would NJ give me a refund in the first place if I was going to owe? I am furious and have an appointment with a different HR Block rep for later this week.  At this point, all I want is for the $250 fee I paid to have my taxes done refunded. Everything that could have gone wrong has.


What are somethings I can say or ask for to ensure this happens?

As of ""right"" now, the only thing that's not scholarship is 5.5 from subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans. I'm currently filing special circumstances with the school, because the IRS and FAFSA believe that my father is living with my mother, and that his paycheck is available to use, which it is not (instead of there being 80-90K a year, there's about 25K).

I need advice, on whether or not I should try to take out student loans (either federal [if i can] or private), what grants I might still be able to apply for, or whether or not I should just give up on going to Valpo.

The reason that I'm only listing Valpo is because they were the only school I got accepted to with a scholarship, and I am ""technically"" enrolled, and I just deferred enrollment for a year, because I wasn't able to fill out the FAFSA.

My GF is a nurse for a major hospital. After speaking with a couple coworkers she found out her take home pay was much higher than theirs, however she knows for a fact they are all on the same hourly wage (all entry level). 

After inspecting her pay stub I don't believe she has the proper income taxes (or any) being taken out from her paycheck. This could all be due to the hospital not having the correct social security # on file when she started working, although this has been corrected. Under the applicable section on her paystub I only see two deductions - 

&gt; Federal OAS -160

&gt; Federal Med - 37.42

So yeah, no state or federal income tax being taken out.

While trying to resolve this issue she also found out she is listed as an exempt employee, and she should be non exempt. She thinks this was her fault as she checked the wrong option when filling out paperwork but I was under the impression that it was up to the employer to determine this classification. 

When she filed taxes this past year she still got a decent federal return (~$1500). If she was indeed not having income tax taken out, shouldn't she have owed a ton in back taxes?

She has been on the phone with her employer trying to get this resolved but the first person she talked to was useless.

Details-
I work for the government, and I qualify for the student loan forgiveness program, but I'm not sure if it's a good fit for me. There are two big concerns I have. One is that making the smallest payment possible is the smartest route on the forgiveness plan, but if plans change, you've gone for years without making a dent in your debt. The second is that I may make enough to afford a payment that is only slightly lower than a standard repayment. In order to be qualifying payments, they must be made as part of a qualifying repayment plan and be scheduled. So, you cannot get your loans forgiven before 10 years, and you cannot use the extended repayment plan. Options are ""pay as you earn"" and ""income-based."" If you make enough money, income based doesn't help, and I'm less sure how pay as you earn works.

I have ~$50k in student loans, with $27k @ 6.8 and the others chunked out at differing amounts with interest rates from 3.4 to 5.6

I am good with numbers, but I'm not really sure how to set up an equation to compare utility.

I am wondering what you would do in this situation. At the end of each month, I've got about $1000 left over after expenses .

Obviously at that interest rate, it is better to put off my ROTH contributions for a little while and throw all of that money at her loans.

A couple years ago i was a desperate and bought a car from a buy here pay here dealership.

A week later the car started leaking oil, so i returned to the dealership to find out they went out of business. 

I was unable to contact anyone from the dealership. It wasn't till a couple months later I walked outside and my car was gone. I called the police and they said the car was repossessed and they provided me the number to a financing company I've never heard of. 

When speaking to new company i found out that my loan was sold to them but the information they had was incorrect. They had the wrong name and wrong address so they were not able to contact me. I ended up paying the past amount due and got the car back. It was at this point the financing company tried to charge me $1000 repo fees. I tried to fight the fee since it wasn't my fault but they tried to apply my car payments to the fees. I ended up not paying the car loan since they would not negotiate with me. they said ""If you have a loan with an interest rate with 30% like this one we know you don't have a choice"".

It's now been 3 years and i still have the car and have not made another payment. My credit report says the car has been repossessed(Which it hasn't!). but my credit has also recovered so now I'm stuck with what i should do. My questions


* If I call them up and tell them to come get the car, does that restart the time clock on my credit report on the repossession?
* I haven't heard anything from the finance company in 3 years, should i just wait till the statute of limitations for suing is over before calling them and telling them to get the car?
* am i missing something?

* Utilities: 80
* Cell phone: 70
* Food: 250
* Internet: 30
* Netflix: 10
* Insurance: 10
* Misc. spending: $200 (clothes, gifts, restaurants, etc.)

So, my current total budget is $975.  I have been able to follow it pretty well - I roll over any excess from the variable categories to the next month so I can ""save up"" for a purchase and whatnot and it has been pretty consistent.

I have been paying off credit card debt with the excess.  I have a total credit limit of $7200 and about $1500 left in debt.  I am currently working overtime since it's summer and hope to have that paid off very soon.

After that my goal is to save up something of an emergency fund, and then get a car.  I would prefer to save up and pay cash for the car but I will need one before I am able to pay cash for it, so I plan to try to get an auto loan or financed vehicle.

Based on my income/expenses, can anyone suggest what a reasonable amount is to pay for a car on my income for car + insurance?

I was thinking of getting something for about $3k, which according to my bank's estimator would be about $75 a month depending on interest rate.  I have also tried some auto quotes online and for comprehensive coverage (which I would need for an auto loan) for most of the cars I've tried out I'd be looking at about $70-90 per month depending on the exact car.  Then there's maintenance which is hard to estimate.

Does that sound reasonable?  Or is that too much?",finance,1436232563
personalfinance,Paying off student loans: reduce interest rate with direct debit or be able to control where my extra payments go?,"Hello PF! Fedloan Servicing handles my student loans from graduate school and a small balance remaining from undergrad. I started paying before the 6 month ""grace"" period, so I got ahead of the payments on my payment plan. Each month, I was paying the rather small amount that was on my bill and then putting extra money toward my highest interest rate/highest total loans. Then, I noticed I could get a .25% lower interest rate through direct debit. I figured it would automatically take out what I owed and I could still manually pay extra each month to the loans I wanted to. I called to get this set up. Interestingly (to me anyway), the monthly withdrawal was much higher than the bill. When I called again, I was told that with direct debit, they would take out this number, which is the amount due each month on my payment plan if I had payed only the amount due each month, regardless of what my bill states. As far as I can tell, the extra money is then spread around my loans haphazardly. So, my question: is it better for me to get out of direct debit and resume paying monthly, applying extra money to my highest loans or is the reduced interest rate worth having the extra money be spread around? Here are the numbers:  

Total loan balance: $29,529.81  
Current payment due: $86.26  
Monthly direct debit amount: $268.58  
Monthly payments I made before direct debit: $300 (two payments of $150 on my pay days)

personalfinance,Graduated in 2010 with 200k Student Loan Debt - My Journey Thus Far,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

I graduated in the Spring of 2010 with just south of **200K** in Student Loan Debt (198.6K to be precise) Many of us here are battling Student Loans and i decided that my story may be helpful to some (if anything, it can give you the *at least im not that guy* feels)

**How I Cultivated So Much Debt:** I had the brilliant idea at the end of high school to follow my dreams of being an Architect and to study somewhere that was interesting and far away to impress my friends and family back home. I chose an out-of-state private school, which over the 5 years i spent earning my degree, the tuition + room and board averaged 56K per year. I worked my ass off my freshman year and earned a half tuition scholarship for the remaining four years. Considering that the scholarship i was awarded added up to 96K i thought i was in good shape. I thought wrong and left college with 198.6K in Student Loan Debt.

**The Real World Got Real:**  I was staring down the barrel of $1458 a month towards Student Loans. I looked into all the possibilities: consolidation, IBR, ect. ect. This is when i found out that many of the options for easing your payments only apply to Federally owned Loans. (80% of mine were private) My best option was to make Interest Only Payments, which lowered my payments by roughly $600 a month for 2 years. 2010 was a dark time to graduate. I spent 4 months looking for a job. The best opportunity i was offered was a 6 month unpaid internship in NYC *which may or may not* become a full-time paid position. I came to the realization that even if i could find an architecture job,i would have a heck of a time keeping up with the impending student loan bills. I knew i had to get creative and get to work fast, my 6 month grace period was almost up. Sallie-Mae was on her way to my front door. 

 **What Did I Do** I was getting a little desperate, I had no safety net, the recession was crushing my parents and they couldn't help. When in high school i gave swim lessons and ran small soccer camps and I decided to go with what i learned from that. I started a business teaching kids how to play soccer. What does that have to do with my dream of becoming an architect? *Nothing*. My first year i made only 12K, it sucked. The next year 22K, the next 34K. By mid 2013 I had grown it enough to be approached by an interested buyer. I sold it for 108K in 2013, paid out over 5 years. I then moved to a different state and started another business doing the exact same thing. (side note: this was the most miserable and stressful thing that i have ever done in my life) While starting the new business, I picked up a job working for a steel fabrication company as a project manager. What does this have to do with my dream of becoming an architect? *Almost nothing but at least its in the same industry*. I work off commission at that job and i have steadily increased my earnings. In 2013 I made 45K total. 2014 I made 63K. This year the ball has started to roll and i am projected to make 130K!

**Whats Next:** I still owe 141K and I am currently paying the $1458 a month towards my loans. I also take 20% of my earnings before taxes and put it towards my loans as well. (This year through June, I have paid off 18K) I am paying my loans off in order of interest, snowballing if you will, and have eliminated all loans above 7.5% (thank you 2008 for the ridiculously high rates) At this pace, i will be able to pay the rest off by the end of 2020.

**My Advice:** From the get go I decided to focus on the bright side of  my crushing debt. **It kept me HUNGRY** I have learned to be decisive, to take calculated risks, to believe in myself and to solidify positive habits. Without the loans, i doubt i would be as successful.
 **Look at your loans as a challenge and rise to meet it!**",finance,1436236730
personalfinance,"A little over $20,000 in credit card debt, my car might need to be replaced soon, need to come up with a solid plan","Hello everybody. I know you get a lot of frantic people asking how to get out of debt, and this one will be more along the same lines. Let me start of with the bad first:

After living at home for 3 years and working a menial job, I got an offer with the federal government for a position with the social security administration. I was absolutely ecstatic, and relocated about 500 miles away from home to Maryland for the position. I've been doing it for a little over a year now. When I first moved out, I didn't have a lot saved, so I took out credit cards to furnish my apartment. However, I got carried away, bought stuff I shouldn't and spent more than I should have. I'm now a little over $20,000 in debt, between 6 cards, my minimum payments are a little over $500, 2 of the cards are at $9,000 and $10,000 a piece.

As you can see, I'm not in the best position, and didn't really realize how bad my situation was until about 3 weeks ago.

And if that wasn't bad enough, I recently took my car into get the transmission fluid changed, and they found metal parts in the fluid. I'll either be paying for a new transmission or a new car soon which really dosnt help.

Now the good:
I don't have any student debts, and I have a stable job that pays $44 1/2K a year. I'm also close to the end of training, and when I finish, my pay will go up to $52 1/2K - year, and I can do up to 10 hours of overtime a week (which I will definetly be taking advantage of.

As for my budget, here it is:

Income (after taxes)	2080

Rent	885 - stuck in a lease until May of next year. Definetly moving

Conservice	 30 - trash, water and sewer

Comcast  85 - hate them with a passion, trying to find an alternative, Internet only

Renters insurance 12.5 - already paid the 150 for a year, till my lease is up

Car insurance 	45 - estimated, after I switch to Geico. If I have to get a new car, this might unfortunetly go up.

Bge	60 - nearly $90 last month due to AC, using fans only now.

Cell phone	45

Gas	80

Groceries	225

Pleasure 	200


This leaves me with about $400 to pay down debt after all is said and done.

I know it looks very daunting, but I do believe I can pay this off, and don't want to default on anything. I want to continue to work for the Government, and defaulting on any payment can get you denied for a security clearance. If you have any suggestions for how to pay down the debt faster, cut spending or any other wisdom you can give me, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all for your time.",finance,1436237272
personalfinance,Parents and relatives doesn't want to cosign a student loan. Don't want to drop out. Need some advice to see through this.,"Hi /r/personalfinance, I've been a lurker for quite some time. Usually someone asks how to pay their loans, well, I want to ask for help on how to acquire some.

I've been dating this girl for almost a year now and she's having trouble on how to continue school without $$$$.

Background info:
We're both going into our third year of engineering in a medium size state university, we are also on track with expected graduation on May 2017. She lives far so commuting is not an option to lower costs. The cost for our school is around $26,000 and her financial aid (FAFSA) is roughly $16,500. Which $7,500 are federal loans under her name and $2000 is of work study. She has a part-time job and makes around $250 weekly, where she saves very little, since she has a payment plan for her summer classes that will be paid off by the end of the summer &lt;$2000. She lives at home now and has a low cost living but her parents (divorced) don't want to cosign a student loan for the remainder of the school costs.

I'm trying to be supportive and help her emotionally through this. I have looked at some private loans that she can out but she has a credit score of around 630 so they would still require a cosigner.

Any advice would be appreciated :)

tldr; girlfriend parents won't cosign a loan for her. She's looking at around $10000 needed for the school year. Her credit score is 630. Drop out is not an option since she's graduating in 2 years in biomedical engineering.",finance,1436237459
personalfinance,"My sister has universal life insurance, and I'm wondering if she would be better off with term. Help me figure it out?","My sister bought Allstate elite index universal life insurance at the age of 25.  She is currently 41.  She has two kids aged 5 and 8.  She owns her house and has no debt.  She is in good health.

I do not know what a term policy would cost for her, but she would probably go through USAA.  She would like to have a 20-year policy, if she were to go that route.

The details:

She pays $80.00/month for $200k policy.

Her bill covering May 19,2014 to May 19, 2015:

Policy value as of 5/19/14: $8,392.71

Additions during the period:

* Total premiums received: $960
* Fixed interest credited: $13.12 
* Index interest credited: $522.99

Total additions during period: $1496.11

Subtractions during period:

* Cost of basic insurance: $244.87
* Cost of riders: 0
* Policy expenses: $120
* Partial surrenders with charges: 0

Total subtractions during period: $364.87

Policy value as of 5/19/15: $9523.95
Cash value as of 5/19/15: $9523.95

Change in S&amp;P 500 index for year: 12.88%

Participation rate: 60%

Cap: 6.5%

Index increase %: 6.5%

Indexing basis: $8046.07

Index increase credited: $522.99


Also, there is no surrender charge.

So, it seems like it's a pretty cheap policy at $80/month.  I'm not sure how much cheaper term would be, though.  I also hate that they gave her essentially half of the market returns.  I'm sure there are high fees too.

Anyone want to help me break this down?  It's all pretty confusing (as I'm sure is on purpose).  I'd really appreciate your input!

personalfinance,Am I doing the best I can with my money/budget?,"Hi. I'm a single recent college ""dropout,"" living on my own (I will be adding a roommate in a month or so, which should help with having a bit more money). As for the reason I ""dropped out"" of school - I was offered a full-time staff position at my school, which comes with the benefit of tuition remission for myself after a year of working there. I only have a handful of classes to finish, so it was worth the savings (private school) to take a year off, and finish for free. 

Now, as for my budget, here's what it looks like (using YNAB):

Rent/Utilities/Internet: $650/month (will be split with roommate starting in August)  
Groceries: $150  
Online services (personal website, spotify, etc.): $30  
Gas: $60  
Spending money: $70  
Eating out: $50  
Medical/Clothing: $40  
Emergency Fund: $40  
Car insurance: $60 (I drive an accord w/ 250k miles with no payments, but I'm scared that it'll break down and I'll have to buy something new. Not because of insurance costs, but because of having another payment)  
Renter's Insurance: $28 (this will go down after I make my three total payments)  
Student Loan payments: $762 (loans are still in deferment, this is a rough estimate of how much I'll pay. I'll break down what I owe below).  
X-fer to savings: $200 (some of this will go to retirement w/ matching after I pass one year at my job)

I have $4300 in savings.  
I make $32k/year.  
I'm debt free (not counting student loans) aside from some short-term credit card debt that I could pay off with my checking balance, I'm just using it because of 0% interest promos and rewards.

What am I doing right/wrong? Is there any way I can minimize my student loan minimum payment by putting more towards them while still in deferment? Or am I locked into the monthly rate I signed up for at the beginning (speaking more towards private loans at this point, I know there are options with the federal ones). What's my best option for tackling these loans with my income and budget?

Private 1: 84 month loan, currently owe: $11,813 principle, $56 interest @ 6.7% fixed  
Private 2: 120 month loan, currently owe: $11,993 principle, $29 interest @ 9.9% fixed  
Private 3: 120 month loan, currently owe: $9,956 principle, $326 interest @ 8.9% fixed

Fed 5: subsidized, owe: $5500 @ 4.66%  
Fed 6: unsubsidized, owe: $2065 @ 4.66%

I’ve been flirting with the idea of refinancing my automobile. I’ve done some basic research, but admittedly, the whole idea of refinancing anything is still somewhat confusing to me.

Current Monthly Payment: ~$530

Current Credit Score (per CreditKarma): ~730

I can make the monthly payment rather easily; however, I worry that I am paying way too much in interest (about $100 appears to go to interest each month). Is it possible to refinance with my current lender? I’ve built a good relationship with them and have other loans through them. I have always been in good standing (not sure if this has any effect on the kind of rate I’d get). I want to pay the car down ASAP, so I’m not really interested in extending the terms. Ideally would like to pay it down within the next 1.5 years.

* Health Insurance - Previously taken out of pay check

* Rent - $700 (+200 extra a month for July-October)

* Gas for car - $22 per fill up 3-4 times a month

* Groceries - $240 (It fluctuates and we switch paying)

* Netflix - $8.65

* Animal costs - $100? (Rough estimate)

* Car loan - $262 a month; $11,991.16 total left

Cell phone, Car Insurance, Electric, Natural Gas, Cable have been paid by my SO instead of contributing to rent. I don't exactly know how much he's paying honestly, and I know that's a problem.

personalfinance,Teacher Loan Forgiveness Advice,"*I didn't see anything specific to teachers in the sidebar, but point me there if I missed it*

My wife recently graduated with her bachelor's in education with about $10k in government student loans.  I've read a little bit about student loan forgiveness if you meet a myriad of qualifications.  Some relevant pieces of information: we live/work in Texas, the school she will start teaching at is Title I and on the list of schools.  From what I can tell she meets all the qualifications (after she works 5 years).  So now my questions:

First, does my income effect her qualifying for loan forgiveness?  I am an engineer so make good money now, and will likely be in six figures in five years.  

Second, her loans are only around the 3.7% area, but are still the highest interest rate debt we have (also have a mortgage at 3%, and a small car loan at 2%).  After making contributions to 401k and roth, my current plan of attack is to make extra payments to my mortgage.  My thought is that at only .7% difference, I should make the ""gamble"" that some of her loans will be forgiven and just continue to make minimum payments for them.

Finally, what if she moves schools and ends up at a non-approved school?  Could she still have some forgiven, just not as much?

So is my thought process accurate?  Is there anything with the loan forgiveness I may have missed or should be aware of?  Any advice is appreciated.",finance,1436281358

I do not know what my minimum payments are for each loan. I've been paying ahead for my loans in an attempt to unburden myself as quickly as possible.

Now, I've been using unbury.me, but I'm confused as to what my minimum payment is per loan. My student loan provider, Nelnet, has been advancing my payment dates since I've been paying ahead. Does that mean that I can make monthly payments for the interest rates on some loans, and meanwhile attack the loan with the highest interest rate with my extra money?

personalfinance,"Paying off a low interest, variable rate student loan","Hi everyone,

I've been thinking about this course of action and am wondering if anyone might have some advice or thoughts.  I recently refinanced my remaining student loans down to a 1.94% variable interest rate.  It's tied to the LIBOR rate, and it adjusted at the first of every month.  Remaining principle is approximately $30,000.  Minimum payment is in the 500 to 600 dollar range.  Interest costs about $50 a month or $1.64 per day.

I've been aggressively paying off my student loans prior, paying about $2900 per month.

I've been wondering about whether it might make sense to make a ""pay of the loan"" type fund.  Essentially, I would pay the minimum on the student loan and invest the remainder into Vanguard index funds.  With the current minimum I pay on the loans, I could put in between 2000 and 2400 per month into investments.  At some point, the amount of my investments would hopefully equal the amount of my loans.  

My idea is that this would allow me to use my money more effectively while my rates stay low, but still give me the flexibility to pay off the loan in one fell swoop if interest rates rose or if I just really wanted to get rid of the debt.  

Obviously, there's risk in this approach, but am wondering what the PF community thinks.  Or would it just be best to continue staying the course and aggressively paying my loans down?",finance,1436285591
personalfinance,"To Refi, or Not to Refi?!","I am currently trying to determine whether or not I should refi my mortgage.  Here are the facts:

Some background:  I've owned my home for a bit over two years.  I bought it using an FHA loan.  However, in my area property values have increased to the point where I now feel that I'm comfortably over the 80% LTV threshold so that I can refi and get rid of my PMI (which is $288.51).  However, in conversations with lenders, my understanding is that I would be able to get a new 30 year fixed at a rate of 4.75%, which would remove my PMI, but reset my amortization AND lock me in at a rate that is 100 bps higher than my existing mortgage. 

If I were to refi at 4.75%, my new monthly payment would be $1,893, however I would need to recast my amortization (requiring to pay more interest/less principal each month) and I would pay $2,500 in fees/transaction costs, which I would roll into the mortgage.

My question for you is:  Do I refi based on these facts, or do I hold off and wait?

personalfinance,Long term planning with decent income,"I'm struggling with what direction to go with our investments/finances. Turning 30 this year, wife turning 33. ~275k income between us that varies slightly due to hours worked and bonuses (we are both W2 employees, just paid based on billings). 260 is a floor, up to 300+ in a good year. Paying off her car this month, owe 40k on mine but its worth 80 if I were to sell it. No CC debt, no student loans (paid off 3 years ago). Wife is pregnant with our first (yay) and due late this year. She will continue to work with the baby.

We just built a new house, have a 700k mortgage on a 1MM house, am comfortable with the payment and the low rate (3.75 fixed).

Neither company offers 401k matches, but both are employee owned so we get stock grants each year. 

So.. the question is what to do with extra cash each month. I have been paying off the cars, but with my car already highly in the black, and the interest rate on it at .9, I don't really see the benefit of paying it off. 

Should I be paying off the house, investing more in vanguard funds - investing in 401k even without company matches? Advice is always to max 401k then max roth. But without any match, and not being allowed to invest in a roth, I don't know what makes the most sense. I fear investments which lock money until we're 65 as it reduces flexibility now and I'm kind of a fatalist meaning I'd rather enjoy our lives now, but I also don't want to screw our future by making short-sighted decisions.

But I have about $75k in disposable income.

* I could jump into the markets but even as a long-term investor I don't feel safe. Especially not right now.


* I could put the money towards the principal value of the home. I'd save that 3.99% but I wouldn't actually increase cash flow.

* Or I could recast my mortgage. I'd get the same 3.99% return on the investment. It would free up about $400/month in cash flow.

* Or I could do nothing and let my money sit in a bond ETF netting me about $30/month. This seems like the worst use of my spare change.


I don't need to increase cash flow but why the hell not? Anything is better than what I am doing with my money right now.

personalfinance,Incorrect collections account on my credit report,"A collections agency has filed a debt of $4,080 on my credit report as ""well past due date; seeking legal action.""  The debt is from a rental agency in California, where I have never lived. I also never received any communication from the rental agency or the collections agency.  I believe that it is a debt for someone with my first and last name and not an identity theft.

The debt validation letters I've seen online seem to be intended for collections agencies to validate the debt *before* it is reported to the credit bureaus.  Will it still be helpful to send a letter to them anyway?  The collections agency has requested verification of identity from the rental agency and said that they hope to have a response by Friday (and to contact them then if I haven't heard anything).

I have all the information I need to send the credit report dispute forms to each bureau. I can't even do that through the online forms because, since the debt is not mine, I'm not able to answer the verification questions about it correctly. 

I've worked on my credit score for several years. My only bad mark was until this happened was that I had a short credit history (oldest account only 8 years, average age of accounts only 5 years).  My FICO score was around 780 in each bureau and has dropped to 620 - 650 because of this.

Will this process take an incredibly long time to fix?  We have a deposit on a house and will need to be approved for the mortgage in approximately six months.

personalfinance,Very unique grad school loan situation; unsure how to proceed.,"I'm starting law school this fall and am unsure whether to take out loans immediately or exhaust most of my savings to pay for the first semester's tuition. I currently have 30k in savings, which, hilariously enough, is barely more than one semester's tuition &amp; fees. My (very fortunate) dilemma is this: My law school will make my loan payments in full if I graduate and take a job that pays 55k/yr or less, and they will make significant contributions to my loans on a sliding scale between 56k-110k. I'm pretty interested in government/public interest work, and I'd estimate that I'm about 50% likely to take a lower-paying job upon graduation and have my loans partially or fully forgiven. If I end up in such a situation, paying 30k now would be akin to throwing the money down the drain. However, if I end up in the private sector, holding on to the money and taking out loans would essentially mean paying interest on money I already have. What would you guys do in my shoes?

Some extra info to consider:

- This year's Grad PLUS interest rate is 6.84%. 

- Due to an extremely generous uncle, I won't need to worry about living expenses while in school.

- If I qualify, my school will make my monthly loan payments over the course of 10 years. The first 5 years will be on a 15 yr payment plan, and the last 5 years will be on a 5 yr payment plan. My school will make such payments as long as I earn within the income-qualifying range and am working at least part-time. Type of work is irrelevant (could work at McDonalds if I wanted). 

- The university will take future spouse's income into consideration. Should I marry, the income requirement for full loan repayment is 120k/yr jointly and slides to 200k, after which we would be responsible for full repayment. I am currently single and don't foresee myself marrying in the near future. 

Taking all of this into consideration, how would you proceed? Are there any other considerations or options that I'm ignoring?

personalfinance,25 year old seeking some advice on my financial plan,"Hey all, I've been lurking for a little while here, and finally decided to make my first post. I'm on mobile so please excuse any awful formatting. Basically I'm looking for some validation/advice for the plan I've come up with for the next few years, so here's the details:

I'm 25 years old, and I just finished my master's degree, I start my PhD in the fall, and I will be making 26k a year (over the 10 months of the academic year) with a raise each year for the next 3-4 years. For the past few years I've been living off of about 12k a year, so this is over a 100% raise. Because of this, however, I basically have no savings right now. 

I have about 100k in student loan debts from my undergraduate and master's combined which are currently deferred until I finish my PhD. This is concerning, but in my field I expect to be able to make enough to pay it off, and most of it is federal. 

I have about 3k in credit card debt from a car accident and losing my job a couple months back, which I just transferred to a citi balance transfer card with 0% Apr for 21 months, so I planned to just divide that 3k by 21 and pay it off evenly over the term of the no Apr offer. 

Now my expenses per month:
I assume I'll be bringing home ~2k a month during the next academic year (Sept-May) for the next 3-4 years. 

I now pay no rent. My parents live 15 minutes from the school I will be doing my PhD at, and they offered to let me move back in to the basement apartment my brother was previously living in free of charge as long as I am working on my degree. 

About $100-120 a month for commuting to and from school/work/parking fees, depending on whether I must travel to anywhere else. 

About $100 a month for car insurance 

About $50 a month for cell phone bill 

Usually about $100 a month on groceries. I save here as well because my parents like having me eat with them frequently as family time. 

About $150 a month toward my credit card debt

About $300 a month in past months toward entertainment. I know this is frivolous and I have been bad about impulse spending. I am working on cutting this back, and it's been very easy since I've been unemployed, but I honestly cannot cut this part of my budget entirely, as it keeps me sane with the long hours I spend working and researching. 

Even so, this leaves me with $1000-1200 extra every month now as long as my lifestyle remains the same, with more becoming available as I work toward curbing excess spending. I have no 401k plan as I'm being paid as a university TA, so I was originally going to just dump the money into a savings account so I had extra money, but after lurking here for a while I'm wondering if I shouldn't divide the extra money between an emergency fund and a Roth IRA or something.

(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1323404/000095014215001634/eh1500945_ex9901.htm)


&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia – Silver Wheaton Corp. (“Silver Wheaton” or the “Company”) (TSX:SLW) (NYSE:SLW) announces that it has received a proposal letter dated July 6, 2015 (the “Proposal”) from the Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”) in which the CRA is proposing to reassess Silver Wheaton under various rules contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada).

&gt;The Proposal outlines CRA’s position that the transfer pricing provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada) relating to income earned by our foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the “Relevant Taxation Years”) by approximately Cdn$715 million (US$567 million). The issuance of the Proposal does not require the Company to pay any amount to the CRA at this time.

&gt;Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law. Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions and is now in the process of preparing its response to the Proposal.

&gt;“We remain confident in our business structure which we believe is consistent with that typically used by Canadian companies, including Canadian streaming companies, that have international operations,” said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton.

&gt;“Generally a company is taxable in Canada on its income earned in Canada, while non- Canadian income earned by foreign subsidiaries is not subject to Canadian income tax. However, with this Proposal, the CRA is seeking to tax, within Canada, streaming income earned outside of Canada by our foreign subsidiaries related to mines located outside of Canada,” added Smallwood.

&gt;Failing a resolution at the Proposal stage, the CRA may proceed to issue notices of reassessment for one or more of the Relevant Taxation Years. If the CRA reassesses Silver Wheaton on the basis outlined in the Proposal, and assuming that Silver Wheaton would be assessed taxes on the foreign subsidiaries’ income on the same basis as its Canadian income, Silver Wheaton currently estimates on a preliminary basis that it would be subject to federal and provincial tax of approximately US$150 million in respect of the Relevant Taxation Years. The Proposal also indicates that the CRA is seeking to apply transfer pricing penalties of approximately Cdn$72 million (US$57 million) in respect of the Relevant Taxation Years. The Proposal does not indicate the amount of interest or other penalties in respect of the Relevant Taxation Years. Further, taxation years subsequent to 2010 remain open to audit by the CRA.

&gt;Should Silver Wheaton receive a notice of reassessment from the CRA based upon the Proposal, we intend to file a notice of objection within the required 90 day period provided under the Income Tax Act (Canada). In such a circumstance, Silver Wheaton would be required to pay 50% of the reassessed amount of tax, interest and penalties. This amount, plus interest, would be refunded if the Company were ultimately successful in challenging a reassessment. Any notice of objection would be reviewed by the CRA’s Appeals Division. Silver Wheaton also has the right to appeal directly to the Tax Court of Canada 91 days after the date of filing of any notice of objection.

&gt;The timing for the Proposal process, the CRA appeals process and/or court process (if necessary following the issuance by CRA of any notices of reassessment), is uncertain. Regardless of the timing, Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions.

TLDR: The CRA wants to reassess the taxes between 2005-2010 by Cdn$715 million (US$567 million) due to SLW's foreign operations. SLW's management believes it had acted within boundaries of their tax code and will be fighting against this in court.

Him: graduate with $160k in federal loans. 30k/yr tuition + 10k/yr living expenses

Me: graduate with 0 debt

Each of us:
- After medical school: 3-5 years of residency. 80hr/wk, $50k/yr

160k in debt is such a daunting number to me. I accept it as inevitable because while I am lucky not to graduate with loans, most students do. The school is luckily in state so we are actually very fortunate because the tuition is twice what he pays for our out of state classmates.

The info: we don't live frugally when it comes to food, our grocery budget is 150 (give or take) a week, however we eat out dinner 1x/week, and each of us takes a lunch out per week, but 6 dinners/lunches and all breakfasts are made at home. Other than that, our bills are pretty minimal. All minor repairs for cars I do, lawn I do, cleaning we do, we only have internet, no cable, and keep our house at 75 normally. Essentially the plan is as follows.


Plan: we get paid an extra check this month. We already have our bills paid from our check on july 3rd/June 19th (mortgage) and we are paying off at least conns, if not conns and kays, and putting whatever is left (outside gas/groceries) toward my wife's vacation to seattle at the end of august. 

Currently I pay 120 payments to conns, and 120 payments to Kays, so in turn, once those are paid, we are taking that ""extra"" 240 and putting it toward her cc due to the higher interest rate. Once that is paid off, (assuming early spring) I'm doing something I most likely am going to get reamed for, and buying another motorcycle. I had one before, and got rid of it because of mechanical complications I didn't feel like dealing with. The next one will probably be around the same price (3000-4500) range. This will likely come from our extra january check, and our tax refund, and will become my daily commuter due to lower gas cost and because I honestly don't know how to live without one. Yes I already have a car, it has been paid in full. Upon buying the bike, we will go back to regularly scheduled programming taking the 240 from before, plus the 80 from my wifes card, and adding it to the current 80 I pay to my cc per month, and paying that off. 


At this point, I'm at somewhat of a crossroads, the balance on school loan will be significantly lower, but the interest on the car will be higher. Regardless of which I choose, we will continue the snowball to pay those off, and then start adding payments to the house for mortgage or upkeep/upgrade. Looking at this abstractly, guessing no major hiccups, we could finish everything within 2 years except the house, and be well on our way for being so young.

personalfinance,Graduating and starting a new job. Advice on how to tackle loans.,"Hi guys!

So just graduated this spring and start my job next week. 

My position doesn't have set hours so I'll be making somewhere between 48k-65k annually. It'll be busier in the summer and slower in the winter months.

Right now I have 2.5k in my bank account. I'm expecting about 2-2.5k more at the end of the month for some school fees company is paying for.

Currently I have about  

36k in student debt at 5.35%  
23k in a car loan at 1.9% (payments of around 675$ for 3 years)  

My grace period for my student loans ends in November so that's when payments would start. However, I plan to do some lump sum payments and get 36k down to at least 30k before by repayment period starts. From then on, I want to take an excess money I have and put it towards my student loan at the end of every month. I get my schedule well in advance, so I should know how much I'm going to be making for the next 2 months at any given time. Hopefully, with that I'll be able to keep enough of an emergency fund to allow me to pay my other monthly costs in case something goes wrong.

I'm also planning on tackling the student loan first because the interest rate is significantly higher.  

My other monthly costs would be:   
Car insurance (225-250$ a month)  
No rent (living at home)  
Gas would likely be at least ($200-300 a month but I get some mileage reimbursements when I'm driving for work)  
Entertainment/Dining ($200 dollars a month?)  
Phone ($60 monthly)  
Gym ($20 monthly)  
Misc ($150 dollars a month?)  


That's about $1650 a month (with car payment) until November. I think I could pinch it to be less than this, but I'd rather budget on the higher side so I don't end up with more expenses than I thought.  

In the first 4 weeks of work I'll be making about 6k net. And it'll likely be the same in August and then decrease in Sept to 4k.  

Is putting 6k towards student loans before November reasonable? Should I try for more?  

How much is enough of an emergency fund for me? I don't really need to worry about covering rent.  

Am I looking over anything? Is there any other advice that you guys could give me?

investing,first job high-earner asking advice on saving/investing for a home,"29 yo resident alien with a PhD joining the workforce first time with roughly 265k (including expected bonuses stated in the contract) yearly salary for 3 years. I will be living with my partner whom I expect can make 6 figures upon graduating and joining me in NYC in about 6 months.

Some might be thinking ""why am I reading this, you've made it so GTFO!"" but I remind myself (and everyone) that the night is dark and full of terrors before rejoicing at the 6 figure salaries! I am starting my job in about 6 weeks and I want to devise a savings/investment plan for these 3 years. I unduly turned into r/investing community for advice. My PhD is in economics so spare me the sermons designated for the layperson, yet enlighten me about specific strategies and tools keeping in mind that I am not too familiar with USA laws and tax system etc.
 
Here is my financial situation: My net worth is low but luckily I don't have any student debt - I did undergrad in home country for free:). I started an IRA in my home country (both to hedge against the shit-goes-down-in-Murica risk and to enjoy a sweet 25% government subsidy) for a couple thousand dollars -- I kinda owe this sum to my parents though. My savings during grad school are pretty much emergency funds i.e. a couple thousand stacked in a money market account. I don't own or owe anything else. Pretty much a clean slate.

I want to buy a home as I want to start a family with my partner as soon as she graduates and joins the workforce. Buying a home in NY area is daunting task. In saving rent vs. living in a quality place trade-off, we went for a place 50% cheaper than what I could personally afford, up to 100% cheaper than we can jointly afford. We locked in for 2 years assuming we cannot buy earlier than that. We are also returning the leased car to avoid additional expenses.
  
My question has three parts:

1- Is buying a home in NY area a sound financial strategy in the first place? 

I don't think we can afford a quality 3 br apartment/condo/whatever in Manhattan but New Jersey properties appear within reach and have a lower property tax. I am not a real estate expert, certainly not expert on anything New York-ish just yet, but the price differential between two sides of Hudson River smells like an arbitrage opportunity keeping 30 year mortgage horizon in mind.
 
I have read many posts here about the advantages of renting over owning. What advantage renting has for a family-minded person in NY? The rental market is hectic in NYC e.g. the broker I worked with mentioned 1% yearly turnover for rentals compared to the huge influx of people like me moving in the city, the leasing manager in my new place mentioned an expected 5% raise on average after 2 years...So I should expect my rents to steadily go up if I want to keep the same standard of living or I got to move further away several times in 30 years. How is this possible when you have kids and you need to stay within the school district?

2-How to invest the money saved for down payment? 

Currently I do not have a Vanguard or any similar brokerage account. (I have just become a resident alien for tax purposes in 2014. For example Vanguard does not allow you open an account if you are a non-resident alien.) What do you suggest for 2-3 year horizon, is fixed income to match the maturities to my horizon too conservative or should I go for mutual funds skewed towards bonds? Given the short horizon and rowdy global markets, I have cold feet for equity, what do you think? 

Another unconventional alternative I want to throw in is to invest in CDs in my home country where most banks happily take dollar deposits (no currency risk). This is almost 0% due to deposit insurance but low return (I imagine 2-3% tops still higher than interest rates in the USA). Way too conservative?

3- How about retirement savings?

I know I am lucky enough to save for both. My company has a standard 401k plan with 50% of 6% savings matching up to some limit on max contribution. Plus I mentioned an IRA at home with 25% government matching. I have calculated how much money needed to max them out: roughly 14k for company 401k and 5k for home IRA. That's 19k that could go towards down payment. Yet 7k free money from the company plus 1750 from home government forgone... It pains me as an economist to leave money on the table. What do you suggest? Should I max the retirement savings first and then save for down payment?",finance,1436305523

She confirmed that I do not qualify for loan forgiveness because I am an art teacher. I asked her about consolidation programs Navient offered. She said they could consolidate just my federal loans -  and use the average interest of my federal loans as the new interest rate while also extending the life of the loan 30 years. She said this is not worth it. After the motivation from a few commenters, I decided while I was on the phone with her to pay off the $850 federal loan @ 6.55%. She took my payment over the phone and congratulated me. I plan on paying the others off soon. Thanks for all the feedback, reddit has helped me more than anyone!",finance,1436313293

personalfinance,"Upside down in my current house, but want a different house. Looking for opinions","The title might be a little off putting but I was really hoping to get some outside perspective. First a few facts

Me:

* 31 Years old
* 815 Credit Score
* 250K combined savings in bankaccount with my wife
* No other debt of any kind besides current home(own our cars, no student debt, never carry Credit card balance), 140k@5.25%, $1700 a month with 16 years left, cant refinance because Im upside down
* Union construction worker, but in upper management. Currently Grossing 4K a week consistently with no end in site(until I decide im not interested in working as much), also great benefits and year end bonuses
* Own Multiple rental properties outright, net me roughly an additional 4K per month, this is on top of my 4K gross a week
* 110k In 401k Currently and my union has a pretty decent pension
* Will be looking to slow down on the hours in the next year when we have kids, pay will drop to around 2100-2600 a week.

Wife

* 31
* Has degree she does not utilize, but gross around 100k+ a year in the service industry
* No debt, no retirement savings or plan
* were both looking to have kids soon, her income will mostly cease when we do, I will be giving her my rentals and income to take care of so she doesnt feel like shes living off of me. (shes always worked, shes concerned about not working)
* Could utilize degree when kids get older, make around 1k a week

We are looking at homes in the 500k range, I am currently upside down in my home by probably around 40k, I owe 140k (original purchase value was 240K) and its probably worth 100k. I got hit hard when the housing market collapsed. 

Originally I was planning on putting 150k down on a 400-500k house, and putting a renter in my current home.I would have 100k left over as a buffer and for any upgrades/additional furnishings I needed. I would still be losing around 500 a month after paying the mortgage, but I was thinking my rental income easily absorbs that and then some. 

Then I Got to thinking, maybe I should just pay off my current home and then rent it out. Im paying a high interest rate, 5.25%, and then I can turn my 500$ a month loss into a 1000$ ish a month gain if I have no mortgage, hold on to it for a while while hopefully values rise a bit and colelct money at the same time. This does leave me with less liquid cash on hand just in case I happen to find a gut rehab as opposed to a move in ready home.

Sorry If this is a little long winded, I was hoping to get different angles before I drop 140k on a loan.

If its of any consequence I was planning on holding onto my current home and my new home for around 7-10 years and then sell the house I live in now for a down payment on a home I would purchase way in the future, and keep the home I am about to purchase as investment. Doing this because I live in the city, where Id like to stay for now, but I know down the road I wont want to raise my children in the city.

personalfinance,At what point should you help family with debt?,"Recently, my mother asked for a loan from me and my sibling to get her and my father out of debt, but I'm not entirely sure if we should or not? It's somewhat substantial (around 30k, so 15k from my sibling and me), and while we can afford to do so I'm not sure it's something that we should absolutely do. My mother offered to write up a contract to pay us back over the span of three years; she even suggested a decent annual interest rate of 5 percent. 

My hesitation lies primarily with her spending habits. While I'm fairly confident in her promise to pay back the loan in full, I feel that she is only asking this because she recently discovered our financial situation and realized that we can afford to essentially bail her out. While her spending habits are not too crazy, she often splurges on trips and eats out a fair amount and will often buy things she doesn't need. Currently, my parents are saving up for a fancy motorcycle, although my mother has assured me that they are not planning on buying it anytime soon. I'm worried that she will use our money to pay off her debts without adopting more frugal habits as a result (and perhaps even splurging on the motorcycle).

I'm mostly feeling obligated because my parents paid for both of our college tuitions (at great financial stress), but I also feel like if she adopted a decent financial plan they could pay off their debts on their own.

personalfinance,Help with debt,"I'm looking for some advice on being debt free..


I currently have about $15,000 in student loan debt and about $4000 in medical debt.

I would like to be ""debt free"" within 5 years.. 

I'll start by saying my credit is already f***ed, and I'm not too worried about it. I don't plan on buying a house or need to finance a car within the next 5-10 years..

I read that after 7 years of debt being in collections the debt falls off of your credit. The medical debt I have has already been in collections for about 5 years. 

First question: is that true? 

If that is true, am I better off to just throw all of my extra money at my student loans (I figure I can do 400-500 a month) and if my medical debt is still there (if I pay off the student loans before the medical bills have dropped off) then throw the rest of the money at that? 
Or should I pay the medical bills first and get them off of my credit?

If it isn't true.. Which should I worry about paying first? I don't have a lump sum of money to try to make a deal with the medical bills..

I'm not too sure what my interest rate is on my loan.. So bottom line I guess would be which is a better ""hit"" to take- the credit or the interest?

personalfinance,Should I buy a condo with student loans?,"I'm about to start an MBA program and I've been offered way more in student loans than I need.  My estimated cost for 2 years is about $12,000 but I've been offered close to $40,000.  I also work full time and don't currently pay rent, so I'm able to set aside money easily.

I want a condo because they're pretty cheap in my area (2 bedrooms in decent areas going for 40k-45k routinely), but they're hard to get financing on.  I also like that they require less upkeep than a home.

So anyways, I'm thinking this makes financial sense because my current student loans (about 15k), are going to be placed on hold again while I'm in the program, which means I can take the $1,000 a month I've been putting towards them and put it into a savings account.  Between the student loans and my savings I should have right around $50,000 to pay cash for a condo when I graduate.  The interest rates on the student loans are pretty close and in some cases less than what I'd pay on a mortgage (if I could even get a loan on a condo), and typically offer much more flexible repayment terms than a mortgage.  The student loans companies are also more willing to work with you to lower your monthly payments than a mortgage company would be.

So basically I'm wondering if there are any downsides to this plan.  To me it seems like an easy way to get cash for a condo at a reasonable interest rate with less risk than a mortgage.  The alternative would be paying off my bachelor's and master's while in school, graduating with no debt but no savings and having to move into an apartment where I pay rent (no down payment for anything) which seems like a waste of money.",finance,1436353672

But I've also got credit card debt at way worse rates, and other smaller debts at similar rates but that I can't get forbearances on.  My income right now is insufficient to support full payments on the student loans and I hope that I can keep them in either forbearance or IBR until my salary increases.  I'm a lawyer in my second year of practice and my position has a great bonus structure, so I'm really hopeful that my income will increase, but for now I'm barely treading water.

Anyway, this should be a simple math problem, but I'm still struggling with it, because I put together a spreadsheet amortizing all of my debts indefinitely until paid off and it basically shows that the capitalized interest on the student loans will effectively double the balances before I even start making capital payments, unless/until my income and payments increase substantially.  

Granted, it's not that I really have a lot of options.  But I can't wrap my head around it.  I am trying to follow the ""snowball"" approach to paying off my debts: paying minimum payments on everything and throwing all of my available monthly funds at the highest interest/lowest balance (conveniently the same) debts, until they are sequentially eliminated, then applying all of that payment to the next debt, keeping the total monthly debt payments the same and increasing it when my income rises, until I'm down to just the one largest debt and start attacking it with huge payments, and of course doing everything I can to avoid new debts along the way (e.g., squeezing another hundred thousand miles out of my car).  

But it just feels weird to watch that one balance ratchet *up* at double the rate that my overall balances are going *down*.  

I've got my fingers crossed that Elizabeth and Bernie come up with a *deus ex machina* to let me refinance these loans at something below 8%... but until then I'm just watching the interest dwarf every other financial figure in my life.  Is there anything I should be doing differently?

Long-time lurker and first-time poster that has recently run into a bit of a snag. As the title states, I'm 21 years old and living at home with my mother and brother. I currently work part time at an electronics company and plan to attend school again in the fall and get my degree over and done with on a federal grant, and my job is gracious enough to offer tuition reimbursement once the semester is over, up to about 8K.

Thing is my situation at home is deteriorating rather quickly. 

See, my father passed away about 2 1/2 years ago and with him went a large portion of the household income, leaving the burden of maintaining his estate on the shoulders of my mother. Apart from having been raised in a very toxic environment as a child, my mother has also dealt with my fathers adultery, his illegitimate child, his excessive spending and playboy lifestyle, my younger brothers autism, and a general sense of depression she's been combating for years. My mother, as much as she's slaved away working to provide for my siblings and I to keep living a comfortable, has reached the limit of her sanity. This has led to countless arguments over trivial things since the day I could walk and I know that continuing to live at home will not be beneficial long-term for our relationship.

I don't want to appear as if I'm running away from my problems because I still plan on stopping by the house and visiting as often as I can and helping out with the maintenance of the house, but I know that continuing to live under the same roof is only going to exacerbate preexisting tensions.

I only became eligible for my company 401K in April, so 2016 will be the first time I can contribute on pretty much any timeline I want. Background:

* traditional 401K (Roth is not an option)

* company matches 100% of my contributions up to 6% of my salary

* my current yearly plan is to max out my 401K, my Roth IRA, and chuck another $6500+ into a taxable investment account (investing minimum $12,000 a year + 401K contributions), but I don't have a specific order to complete those tasks in

* I have no debt, so paying off student loans, etc, is not a consideration

* 401K contributions are currently allocated across these funds - WF Advantage Emerging Growth, Schwab S&amp;P 500, Janus Balanced T, JPMorgan Large Cap Growth, Janus Perkins Small Cap Value, and Columbia Mid Cap Growth Z; the contribution weightings may change, but the mix of funds is likely to remain stable

* IRA and taxable investments are held by Vanguard and all investments so far are in the Vanguard Healthcare Index Fund

The two contribution scenarios I'm contemplating are:

* front-loading by contributing 90% of my gross over the course of 8 pay periods

* evenly distributing my contributions across all 26 pay periods (about 30% of my gross per pay period)

I know that DCA isn't generally the best investment strategy, but it seems that I save $4400 in federal and state income taxes over the course of the year if I front-load, whereas I save $5600 in income taxes if I evenly distribute. Is there a way to estimate the difference in potential returns between the two options to decide whether the returns from front-loading would outweigh the disadvantage of smaller tax savings? Should I be looking at this decision another way?

personalfinance,Small victory! I've *finally* managed to re-organize my entire portfolio into the Couch Potato Portfolio,"My story so far: I got some *awful* advice from a bank's ""financial advisor"" - he had 17/18 year old me put all my savings into GIC's (sorry, Americans, but I'm Canadian - these are basically CD's in the US, I think). Worse yet, they locked for 5 years, and couldn't be touched... for an interest rate *less than inflation*.

5 years later, I wasn't living at home anymore (I was in university), and despite me having updated my addresses, they mailed the renewal/maturity info to my parents. By the time I got the letters, the renewal window had closed and the money was trapped for another 5 years.

I also saved some more money up, and my new ""advisor"" had me put it all in a very expensive mutual fund, and flat out lied about how she was compensated.

Meanwhile, I'd been learning more about budgeting, saving, proper credit, etc. I opened new bank accounts with no fees, discovered Mint, and eventually YNAB, and got really good at saving money. I bought a house at 25 years old (in hindsight, perhaps a mistake) and was horribly housepoor.

*Finally*, the original (now 10 years old) GICs matured again, and I got ahold of the letters (again mailed to my parents). I called them, gave them a really harsh talking to, and closed all accounts with my brick &amp; mortar banks. They promised me I'd be able to see my GIC's/RSPs and the online account would still work, but I couldn't. They became ""orphaned"", I had zero visibility into my own money.

It's been nearly 2 years now since I started closing those accounts. I've managed to slowly migrate all of those funds as they matured into one complete, low cost index fund portfolio. Forms upon forms, phone call after phone call, but I am finally rid of that brick &amp; mortar bank, and with an online-only bank that:

* Doesn't charge me fees for chequing/savings
* Offers low-cost index funds for RSP, TFSA, or just general trading
* Has the best customer service ratings across Canada.

I'm actually really hopeful I can find a reason to refinance my mortgage with them as well in a few months, but that will be a decision best left to the hard numbers. :)

**tl dr;** Despite being lied to by *two* financial advisors at the banks, and 10+ years of bullshit &amp; losses, I've finally moved my savings into a smart, positive-flow portfolio.",finance,1436373756

personalfinance,Need advice on student loan repayment.,"I graduated in Spring 2014 with about $33,000 in federal subsidized and un-subsidized loan debt. Right before I graduated, I had to choose which repayment plan I wanted to go on. I chose the 10 year plan where your payment is the same every month ($362) for the duration. The other viable option was a 10 year staggered repayment where payments start off relatively low at around $150 and climb to more than $500 by the end of the 10 years. The only catch with the latter option is that I'd end up paying somewhere around $2,500 more in interest by the end of it.

My principal balance is currently $30,477, with $55 of accrued interest, making my total $30,532. I have about $1500 worth of credit card debt I will have paid off before the interest kicks in during September. 

Currently, I make right at $26,000 before taxes per year, about $20,500 after.  I'm paying my bills each month, but I can't save anything and my employer doesn't offer benefits. My aspiration is to open a Roth IRA with Vanguard, and to build an emergency fund.  I get paid every two weeks, and once I've paid my bills on payday and set aside gas money, I have around $50 spending money for two weeks, and can't save enough to move out of my parent's house.

BOTTOM LINE: Should I change my loan repayment plan and end up paying $2,500 more in interest after 10 years? Sorry if this post isn't structured well. Consistent lurker and first time poster.",finance,1436375172

personalfinance,What do? US Student Loan Repayment with $CAD falling (CAN/US),"I’m an international graduate student, in Canada from the USA. I, like many, have taken out student loans for undergrad. One loan, has gone into repayment and will not allow me to defer it any longer even though I have been continuously enrolled in one program or another since taking on the loan. I should have never taken out the loan, but I was new to private student loans and took the first one that I found (13.5% interest rate). 

TL;DR $3500 student loan, 13.5% interest years ago, blew up to nearly $7000. 

I spend  C$1200/mo, rent, groceries, phone, utilities, etc.  I make C%1700-2500/mo depending on how much TA work I am assigned that term. 

I have C$3000 in savings. My partner has C$5000 in savings. My question to you is, should I throw my savings into repayment for that loan? And rely on my partner if anything unexpected comes up? The Canadian dollar has been falling this whole year, today, C$3000 = 2300 USD. Would it make sense to throw this at the loan and continue to make C$250-625/mo payments to kill the loan? (half loan/half savings of monthly surplus)

I will be moving back the the US in 2 years and earning USD. As it stands now, if I make the minimum payment of U$75/mo the loan will be at U$5400. If I kill the loan off now, I’m ‘losing’  nearly 30% by transferring C$ to U$. Upon graduation, I should be making between $55-65k/yr with no idea of where I’ll live.

personalfinance,I just graduated high school and and need help deciding if student loans are a viable option for college payment. More info inside.,"I'll start by saying that my parents have on several occasions all but flat out said that they expect me to pay for college myself.

That being said, I've received a fairly large financial aid package from the school I plan to attend. It breaks down like this:


Award | Amount/Year
---|---
Grant/Scholarship | $44,420
Direct Stafford Loan: Unsubsidized 1| $4,500
Campus Employment| $2,250
---| $51,145

My total comprehensive fee (tuition, fees, room, board) comes to **$62,046**

This leaves me with **$10,901** to come up with.

I currently have **$1,200** in the bank. However, some of that will be spent on expenses like gas and other things. I'm also in the process of looking for a job. I had to quit my last part-time job because they weren't giving me enough hours. My last days is this Friday, the 10th. 

For safety's sake, let's assume that I don't get another job at all and that I end the summer with $900. I'm looking at **$10,000** to borrow a year, which is a lot. 

Is this feasible?

For some background, I plan to attend a liberal arts college and do pre-engineering and then either use a 3-2/4-2 program to finish my degree or go to grad school to finish as an Aerospace Engineering major. If you are unfamiliar with a 3-2/4-2 program basically, I do three or four years at my liberal arts college and am then *guaranteed* admission to a participating school where I would finish my degree.

The reason I ask if this is feasible is because I know Aerospace Engineers make a lot. However, I also understand that I won't be making $120K right out of the gate. I just want to make sure I'm not going to drive myself into deep debt doing this.

I do also plan to get a part-time job during college and work a lot on breaks, but for the sake of safety I'm assuming the worst case scenario.

**Side-question:** I live in North Dakota, the only state with a state bank, but will be attending a school in Minnesota. Is it more advantageous for me to take loans from the federal government, my state bank, or the credit union I bank with?

personalfinance,Credit Report/Student Loan/CC Debt Question,"I need to buy a car but because of students loans + cc debt my income:debt ratio creates problems when trying to get a loan. My income is often in the form of cash so even though I can comfortably make $400/mo payments because there isn't a paper trail I'm having trouble getting even a small loan of $5000. 

I've been working hard to remedy this and have paid off more than $5,000 in cc debt in the last 6 months with about $4,000 to go. I figure I'll tackle the cc debt first because of the interest rates then get back to pounding down the student loan after I get a vehicle.  

To help monitor my credit I created an account at creditkarma.com (amazing website, btw!). When I signed up my credit score was around 680+. Then, because of gross miscommunications, I missed payments on my student loan. I didn't realize at the time, but my students loans are not consolidated. I had made the assumption that since I had one singular monthly payment each month the loan itself was a singularity as well. I was dearly mistaken, my goof caused 'missed payment hits' on 14 separate accounts lowering my score to 530! ...so sad. 

I've since consolidated my student loans. Is there anything else I can do to raise my credit score after such a huge hit? Or any advice on finding a loan with a good interest rate with my history in mind? How will creditors view my credit report now?

Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated!

gaming,[X-post] Playstation will not help me maybe you guys will know how!,"So I own 1 PS4 and up until a few weeks back I was able to share the content I purchased with the sub accounts on the system. Then one day out of the blue my wife on her account was not able to get in the Crucible on Destiny. It told her she needed Playstation Plus which my account already has. So she tried to play GoT but it told her she needed to purchase the game which my account already purchased. So I call Playstation and they said someone logged on to my account, from a computer not system, and switched primary PS4's. I know someone hacked me cause i only ever owned 1 PS4 but there are now 2 on my account.


So Playstation sends me a link to the deactivation web form but whenever I click on it it tells me they are not excepting request. It has been giving me that same message for weeks. Today I call Playstation to tell them their link is not working and he tells me there is absolutely nothing they can do but ""send the issue up"" and that I should keep trying the link.


At this point I am so fed up with Playstation. How can customer service not know how to contact the deactivation group? I even ask if he can just check from his work pc to see if the link works for him and he said that playstation.com is blocked from his computer. I am told that I have no choice but to wait till December and change primary systems. If this is the case then I'm going to purchase an Xbox 1 since you never hear of these issues from them.

My wife has put a good amount of time in Destiny but now cannot do anything with her character because of this, which sucks since the new one will be here in September. My son can't play his NBA 2k15 or CoD Advanced Warfare, which for what I paid for the dlc's sucks.

If anyone has been through this please let me know if you got any help from Playstation.

personalfinance,Hard working university student. Best way to invest money?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,
I have a few questions, to give you guys some context I'll first explain a bit about my financial situation.

I am 19 years old, and I am from the netherlands. Right now I study computer science at an university, and I work part time as a developer.

In the netherlands we have special governmental student loans, which are pretty awesome. They charge about 0.5-2% interest. (Varying per year, right now its low, like 0.8%) Due to the low interest rate I figured it would be wise to max it out, and invest it. Right now I deposit it to a investing account at a dutch firm, that have an historical average of 8.8% and only charge 0.5% deposit fee's and 0.59%/year handling fee. I can withdraw monthly.

I earn pretty good for a 19 year old, about 12.50(14 usd) per hour, and I work quite a bit, so I earn about 500-600 euro per month, on top of the 850 i borrow.

At the moment I have about 3K in the investing account, 1K on my day-to-day checking account(A bit higher than usual now because I am about to go on a holiday so I like to have a decent buffer), and I got about 6-7K in bitcoin/litecoin. I know cryptocurrencies might not be popular here, but I made a boatload in them, and as a computer science student I'm amazed by the technology. Right now I am not really looking in investing futher into crypto, but I dont really want to sell out. I want to ride that one out for atleast another 5-10 years or so.




So my questions are:

1) Does /r/personalfinance agree it is a smart choice to max out a 1% loan to put it on a 8.8% investing account?

2) My montly income(work + loans) is about 1400 euro. My living expenses are about 600 euro per month. What would be the best ways to invest the other 800 euro?

3) Should I be looking at investing my self, or just deposit money to an account and let a bank invest it for me? (Ofcourse I do pay attention to the historical rates, fees, other nasty rules, etc)",finance,1436386640

personalfinance,Should I drop my son as a dependent on my taxes?,"Some back story here is a grew up poor as hell and mostly on the street supporting myself. I didn't have money for college so I joined the service to help pay for it and my stepdad let me stay at his house that was close to my school but he didn't otherwise help me financially in any way.

So the Army gets out of paying for my school through mostly loopholes and just general bureaucracy but my state/federal aid require I disclose my household income. I was not a dependent of my step dad but he was a member of my household and I was working 2 part time jobs.

What that meant was despite being poor I ended up not qualifying for a lot of programs I should have been able to qualify for (even student loans!). If I would have payed my step dad rent he would have had to report it on his taxes as income and I don't think he wanted to deal with it but in hindsight I would have been much much better off because it would have allowed me to exclude his income on my financial aid applications.

I'm sure I'm missing some details about how all of this works but now I am doing ok financially and before too long my son will be looking at attending college. My income will prevent him from getting financial aid for school. 

He is young but has a part time job, should I just start charging him rent and stop claiming him as a dependent? It would cost him some money in the short term but it would be mere peanuts compared to what it could potentially save him for college.

If he becomes independent does my income no longer count against him or does it not work like that?",finance,1436387719

personalfinance,Understanding Federal Taxes,"Hey everyone,

I am asking a question regarding taxes in the US, bc i had to pay extra last year.

I am married and i have an income of about 62000 and paid roughly 5600 in federal income tax withheld after i listed 2 exemptions. They told me to do 2 since i am married and filing jointly.

My wife made roughly 55k and only filed 1 exemption, resulting in roughly 6400 taxes withheld.

together that makes about 12k in fed tax paid (not social of medicare).

My calculations online say that the witholding amounts are exactly what i should have.

However, on my taxes in 2014, it stated that i should have paid almost 16k in federal taxes. The taxable income is about 96k after deductions and exemptions.

How is this possible. She filed to little exemptions, I filed the correct amount of exemptions, yet when combined, our taxes were way more than what was withheld...

I just cannot figure it out. I know when you combine incomes you fall in a higher income bracket, but is that why this happened? Seems a bit odd no?",finance,1436389066

I'm 21 years old.

Net Income = 1900 Euro, increasing to 2400 from August.
Expenses = 1150 Euro per month. 
0 debt, 0 assets(I rent my apartment).

I recently opened a savings account with my bank, but the interest rates are very poor(in my opinion), it's about 3.5% per year. 

I'm from Ireland and I was wondering if anybody had any advice about investing money on this side of the pond.

Over the last year I have been savings small amounts and blowing the rest of my income, I have about €4000 saved up, 2000 in current account, 2000 in savings account. 

I'm just looking for smarter ways to use my money I guess, when I see 6000 in my account I end up buying random things I don't need/use or gifts. How can I better use my money to help me in the future?",finance,1436391360

personalfinance,How does the stock market treat our 401Ks?,"I started with asking ""How do you protect your 401K from stock market crashes in a time where rising interest rates are set to hammer bonds?"" The stock market is prone to crashing, and it can take nearly a decade to get back to even. If we treated our 401Ks like real money, we probably wouldn't just accept losing half of that money. 


Then it struck me, when the market crashes, it's because people are selling off their stocks, but 401K money is passive. Most people never touch it, and some is automatically buying into the market while it freefalls. Essentially a market crash is other people withdrawing your passive retirement savings. 


So I want to know:


How much 401K money is in the stock market, and what percentage of the stock market's total valuation does it represent? 

How does that compare with what's been contributed by employers and workers?

If you account for total withdrawals, how are those 401Ks doing? Does their current value plus withdrawals equal or exceed the amount contributed?


If all other trading were suspended, how much would 401K contributions and withdrawals push the market up or down every month? How does that compare to what happens?


Ultimately I just want to know if we're saving money with our 401Ks, or do they just inflate the market so that Wall Street investors can skim some off every now and then? I find it disconcerting that I can't easily find answers to my questions. 401K contributions are a large predictable force on the market, so I'm sure that someone knows what effect they have.",finance,1436395313

personalfinance,Just received a derogatory mark for an unpaid medical bill. What do I do to get it to go away as quickly as possible?,"I was billed for medical imaging for an amount that my crappy college health insurance did not cover. This happened in an emergency trip to the ER in November 2014 and a follow up at a separate imaging facility. Altogether amongst 3 separate medical organizations the uncovered amount was about $600, but this particular bill in question was for $100. Lump sum or just one bill alone, I couldn't pay it. 

After I saw the bill, I read that if I applied for state medicaid, they would backpay all medical bills up to 3 months before you submit the application (if you're approved). I made next to nothing, no parental or family support whatsoever, and my friends in similar situations got medicaid, so I figured there's no reason I shouldn't get it. I ignore the bills in the mail, ignore the final notices, because the decision was set to be made by the end of March (I applied in January 2015). Well it's now July--I call the medicaid application office weekly, and they still have no decision as to my acceptance or denial, and can't give me any additional information. Yesterday a collections agency for said $100 bill in question put a derogatory mark on my credit report. What do I do? I want this to go away as soon as possible, I don't know how much longer I can wait to get approval notice. 

I should also note that in June I began a full-time job working as a federal employee in a medical institution, and I now have medical benefits (which now will likely disqualify me for Medicaid). These benefits, however, do not include medical bill back-pay.

I am a recent college grad making 55k.  I have 15k in a savings account and about 30k in student loans which I am paying the minimums on a ten year plan.  

Now for my question: My employer has an almost too good 401k match.  They will match my contributions 25% to the dollar with no upwards limit (besides the federal limit obviously).  I am putting 15% away in both a traditional and roth 401k, which just about puts me at 18k for the year, so I am getting an additional $4500 or so as a match.  

I cant really save any more money than I am now, but my father keeps suggesting that I take some of that money and instead put it into a IRA or even some mutal funds.  He thinks that, while I am saving tons for retirement, I will not have any ""mid-life"" money saved for a house etc.  He thinks that all my money is basically locked away in these retirement vehicles and I wont have any ""mid-life"" money to fall back on?

personalfinance,Avalanche method payments: Weekly or Monthly?,"I want to know how to get the most out of my repayment for my student and car loans.

I graduated in 2012 with 68k of loan debt after seven years of school and have gotten my student loans down to 45k(6.25%) through a discharge (paid taxes) and making extra principal payments. I recently closed the last of two private loans. My credit is pushing 775.

The car that I've driven for 3 years has a $2k loan associated with it and is worth $6k. I have a 6 month emergency fund saved and contribute to the match to my 401k on top of saving another 5% that I'll dump into an IRA at the end of next year once I have &gt;5k in that part of my savings.

I plan on paying off the auto loan by December and saving for a down payment until mid-March to purchase a vehicle that after trade-in and down payment will leave me with a loan ~25k. The threads that I've read on this sub disparage purchasing a new vehicle but I *want* a new car one time in my life.

My current income allows me to allocate $1,200 a month to paying down debt and I've been following the avalanche method by making monthly payments on my loans. Minimum payments on all and then the highest interest rate loan gets the remainder.

But when following the avalanche method is it more beneficial to make weekly payments to prevent interest capitalization from happening? I can't seem to find a reliable calculator online that would show me the savings on paying ~45k(6.25%) and 25k(0.9%) at ~$280 weekly vs ~$1200 monthly.

I might be interested in paying monthly for the car and weekly for the student loan if weekly payments (on the car) don't save me that much over the course of the next few years.

The avalanche method is intended to be as aggressive as possible and I'm looking for a little guidance here.",finance,1436399686

* I have $7000 in stocks right now that were just disbursed to me through my employee stock purchase plan. 
* I make $65k in addition to overtime, commission, and bonuses. in 2014 I made $95k and this year I am projected to be close to at least $80k.
* My debts include $62k in student loans and $11k in credit card debt. I am currently at a 50% utilization rate on the credit cards. I have a car and motorcycle for a total of $12k of debt. 
* Rent in my area is very high and rentals are hard to find. For example I am paying $1400 for a condo that is being put on the market for $170k. Also, I want to buy a house to lock in an interest rate while the rates are low. 


So is buying a house a good idea? I would be looking for a $200k house with an FHA loan with 3.5% down. I am planning on staying in this area for a very long time. I am looking for single family homes rather than a condo. Is it better to use the $7000 towards credit card debt and wait on the house? I am just worried that the interest rates will go up, and then I am going to have to move again and pay higher rent compared to what I would pay for mortgage/tax/insurance if I bought. Also, I have the option of borrowing $9000 from my 401(k) for either 5 or 10 year terms to lessen the PMI. So I could add the $9000 to the $7000 for $16000 downpayment.

Here's the thing. We are getting married in three months and we could use the extra financial aid refund to put towards paying off credit cards and to help recover from spending money on the wedding.

For most of my life I have been playing games. I have seen friends, even people stop playing games. I cannot understand how people go through a day without playing games. I cannot find many days where i haven't played a game. 

The only person I know in real life who does this stopped playing around the time he got his first girl friend. He and I are both 20. Both of us were and still are in close to the same situation we both have had literally the same jobs but yet our outlook on games has changed SO much in the time we have known each other. 

Before his girlfriend he and I moved in together and I was working a full time job and he was working a part time job, we both played as much as we could, but then everything changed. We slowly stopped playing with each other. When before we moved in together we played with each other all the time. We even would hangout all the time before we moved in but it disappeared. We no longer would play games or watch movies or do anything together. 

We were on close to the same schedule. Even though we lived in the same apartment it felt like he still lived somewhere else. he never wanted to do anything with me. I ALWAYS wanted to play or do something with him. Once he got a girlfriend he stopped playing all games except one APB:Reloaded. Even after she dumped him he continued to play the same game only. I have come to see myself, that it is possibly because it is familiar and he knows how to play it. 

The kicker though he only uses about 20% of his time awake and away from work to actually play it. What else is there to do? He no longer has a girlfriend. He claims the only game he can have fun in is APB: Reloaded. Now after moving out he still will only play one game when he does play and when he doesn't. He ""hangs out"" with his new room mates where in the past he did nothing with his roommate. 

I just can't understand after being a life long gamer how his life has changed to ONE game all his game time. I have made myself like APB: R just so I can actually play something with him. I scoured the internet but when you put in something like ""Why does it seem my bestfriend has driffed away from gaming"" All it really gives is ""Take back your like from Gaming addiction"" titles and it irritates me that gaming is seen as an addiction.

 I mean what is there to do other than gaming? What could possibly make someone give up something they have loved doing their whole life to basically drop gaming as if it were an insignificant piece of junk?

7) The solution is to put each currency up on a market and have the “issuers” compete on a market in which the citizens or users of the currency vote with use on the quality of the currency, which in turn effects price.

8)Money suppliers of each currency are forced to participate because of the introduction of a decent (but not necessarily ideal) currency bitcoin, which is naturally better than all Keynesian currencies of its’ time because it has a stable inflation rate, the cost of production is fairly predictable, and every national currency can be exchanged for it (via internet).

9) The result is asymptotically ideal money, because the Keynesian bankers of the respective major currencies are forced to print a money that has a closer and closer relation to their respective regions’ ICPIs.

10) A currency that reflects such an ICPI will be well valued and a currency that does not well reflect its regions’ ICPI will be disfavored for a better one (such as a bitcoin).

11) The markets naturally determine “ideal-ness” of each currency and simultaneously put pressure on the currency issuers (as if they are producers of a commodity) forcing them to solve the incredible complex problem of creating an ideal money based on supply (and monetary policy).",cryptocurrency,1436428342
investing,Foreign investment property advice needed,"Hello Reddit! For various reasons, I am very interested in purchasing investment property in Uruguay. Probably around ~$150,000 USD is what I'm looking to invest. Since I will be spending the majority of my time in the US, I figured I will have the property managed by a management firm which I expect to take somewhere around 8-15% of the monthly rent based on my research. Depending on my interest rate, I believe I will be able to rent it out for slightly more than my monthly mortgage payment. As of right now my base salary is $23/hr giving me a base salary of ~$48,000. I do make much more than this, but I was advised to exclude my overtime to give me a sort of 'safety net'. Counting my overtime, I made a hair over $105,000 salary last year since my shifts are 12 hours and the oilfield was booming. I have about $5,000 cash on hand (emergency fund), ~$13,000 worth of stock I am eligible to sell (should be getting another ~$3K or so next month of company stock that I won't be able to sell for 6 months), and I have a 401(K) balance of ~$21,700 of which ~$11,500 is full vested (how much I keep if I leave before working a minimum of 4 years w/ the company). Obviously I would have to take out a loan to pay for such property. My question though has to do with getting the funding for a down payment, particularly since this is a foreign investment. What tax liability would I incur if I withdraw money from my 401(K) or sold my stocks? If I sold it all ($13K stocks &amp; $11.5K vested 401K) how much would I have left over for a down payment?

So basically to put my situation in perspective, I had been a student, couldnt find work, went from making $11/hour to getting a labour job $24/hour with 12 hours of overtime bi-weekly. Obviously with this was a huge influx of funds, but I didnt change my lifestyle. I have very few expenses, live at home with parents kind of deal. 

I have a student loan sitting at $2500 at a very low interest rate (paid bi-weekly for $150), a car loan that I make $300 bi-weekly payments to (this was increased after new job), and I have about $400 bi-weekly in other expenses (insurance, gas and I smoke). 

Aside from that it leaves me with essentially $800 in extra assets that I hammered into investments through a TFSA. I am saving primarily for a 30 per cent down payment on a house at a maximum of 2 years.

finance,Bloomberg: Complexity Curse Turns Into Blessing in NYSE Hours-Long Halt,"(Bloomberg) -- You might have heard about the New York Stock Exchange’s trading halt Wednesday. If you were an investor, that’s probably all that happened -- you heard about it.

In a fragmented market where no venue controls more than 16 percent of volume, the halt was almost impossible to detect for anyone but professional traders and brokers, according to Yousef Abbasi of JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC. Anyone who wanted to buy or sell stocks could, just not at NYSE.
“Today proves that we have a resilient infrastructure,” said Abbasi, the global market strategist at JonesTrading in New York. “If something goes down, something else picks it up. Trading goes on.”
At the same time, the rupture joins a series of high-profile breakdowns from Knight Trading’s order deluge in August 2012 to the May 2010 flash crash that embolden critics who say the market’s very complexity makes it unreliable.

“Far too many investors are already concerned that our critical trading technology infrastructure is held together by dangling wires and duct tape,” Dave Lauer, co-founder and chief technology officer of Kor Group LLC, wrote in an e-mail Wednesday. “Today definitely doesn’t help dispel that fear.”
The best and worst of electronic markets were on display Wednesday, when a computer malfunction forced a 3 1/2-hour halt on the NYSE that was easily sealed off from other venues. There are so many places to trade now that the NYSE and Nasdaq Stock Market have gone from handling 80 percent of volume in 1997 to 40 percent on average last month.

Fragmentation Proponents

“The proponents of more fragmentation in the U.S. market are happy this happened, to show that competition of exchanges is a better thing,” said Frank Maeba, managing partner at Breton Hill Capital in Toronto. “I personally think it’s a bit messy.”

The NYSE’s systems are all functioning normally in Thursday’s trading, the firm said in a statement.
Two people briefed on a preliminary review said the computer malfunction that knocked out trading probably stemmed from a software update that went awry. The NYSE must now verify the cause and report its conclusions to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said the people, who asked not to be named because the inquiry isn’t public.

Tom Farley, the exchange’s president, made the decision to suspend trading when it became apparent investors couldn’t rely on the market to provide accurate data.

‘Configuration Problem’

“There was a configuration problem in our system,” Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg television. “It likely had to do with an upgrade but that’s premature and it’s something that will come about as part of our full analysis of the situation.”

The suspension, lasting from 11:32 a.m. to just after 3 p.m. New York time, temporarily removed the 223-year-old NYSE from the network of platforms that makes up the American equity market. That network kept running, however, as exchanges such as the Nasdaq Stock Market and Bats Global Markets Inc. picked up the runoff.

“If a client called up and wanted me to execute a trade, I could still do it,” said Michael Antonelli, an institutional equity sales trader and managing director at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee. “You can trade U.S. equities on lots of different venues. That’s a plus and minus today.”

The two NYSE venues affected by the shutdown handled about 14 percent of all U.S. stock volume in June, with the rest spread among competitors such as Bats and Nasdaq and dozens of dark pools and other private platforms operated by securities firms.

‘Good Reminder’

Brokers were able to steer orders to buy and sell stocks, even those listed on NYSE, away from their home exchange on a day when concerns about China’s economy and Greece contributed to a 1.7 percent drop in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index, the second-biggest decline since March.

The disruption underscored how quickly the calm can be broken in the U.S. stock market, where about $270 billion worth of stocks trade hands each day. Order has occasionally broken down in a system that is spread among 11 different exchanges and dozens of private venues.

“Today is a good reminder on the number of diverse venues out there, which has frustrated traders for a while,” said Craig Viani, vice president at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut. “There are a lot of people out there who long for a consolidated market view, but the byproduct of fragmentation is that it does strengthen market stability.”

Too Many

Eleven exchanges are too many for Themis Trading LLC’s Joe Saluzzi. They exist not to serve individual investors but to make it possible for high-frequency traders to do battle with each other by sniffing out price discrepancies, he said.

“Those are the extra fragmentations you don’t need and are using it just for arbitraging,” Saluzzi said. “You can have three exchanges and you can aggregate liquidity better and get rid of the fragmentation issue. I’d still argue that fragmentation is a bad thing.”

To market watchers like Jaret Seiberg of Guggenheim Securities LLC, nothing that happened Wednesday hurt his confidence in the market’s integrity.

Fragmentation “means there is still robust trading even when a major exchange experiences a technical glitch,” Seiberg, an analyst at Guggenheim, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. “This is negative for those who complain that market fragmentation is hurting liquidity and small investors.”",finance,1436454844

&gt;Knowing of our shared desire for a free and open Internet for all Americans, I am writing to update you on key net neutrality legislation.

Poll after poll confirm that the vast majority of Americans support an open, free and Democratic Internet.

I encourage you to continue communicating with those lawmakers who do not share our views as the bill advances through the legislative process.

Bitcoin,"Code once released into the wild began managing human behavior, by promise of reward, not fear of debt.","The Music has stopped and Greece was left standing in the first round of musical chairs we call the debt-bubble. Greece is really just a sideshow for the new debt slavery in China.

The technical manner in which our global economy creates debt systemically leads to its own inevitable demise. Interest grows exponentially, inflation grows exponentially, while wages have flatlined. The total result of the system is a transfer of wealth from the productive classes to the managment classes. Where do you get money from? The bank. Where does your business get money from to pay you? The bank. Who has debts? Everybody. Who owns those debts? The bank. How is it that the world has come into a situation where all the people who build, create, teach, and manufacture are in debt to the people who simply move numbers around?

The numbers are fictional, our houses, roads, food, water those are real. That is not to say that there is no value in properly allocating resources by moving numbers around, but the financial benefit to the individual of doing so far outweighs the value the individual provides to society. We have come into a situation where we cannot create value without operating off of debt. Essentially we are managed by our fear of our debt. Inflation increasing exponentially while wages stagnated, combined with student loans and rising medical costs, keeps the millennial generation grounded. It is not possible to work a minimum wage job full time and even make enough money to pay off rent anywhere in the country (the median rent in every state is greater than 40hours at minimum wage in each state).

Inflation is not some kind of guaranteed fact of life. Inflation only happens when those in control of the money supply intentionally debase the currency, historically for their own gain. Inflation happens every time you use your Credit Card or get a loan from the bank. You participate in the process of stealing value from everyone else who holds USD by creating new digital currency on the spot. The crazy thing is that the people in control of the USD won't even publish how much they have inflated the currency and haven't for years. The ""Federal Reserve"" a PRIVATE organization (like Federal Express) controls the USD and they stopped publishing the M3 money supply in March 2006, so we have to go off other pieces of data to glean how much money is being created. http://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/h6/discm3.htm

Now it is bad enough that this system was intentionally created to put most humans into debt slavery, but the Banks use their wealth and power primarily to fund wars and military operations. They get to play both sides and then when the destruction is over they get to finance the loans for rebuilding. And because they can create money out of thin air (because we accept it) they can never lose. Fail to repay your loan and they usually end up with an asset of equal or greater value, never having had to put up any real risk in the first place. Through this process, over time everything becomes owned by the banks and everyone is perpetually renting/mortgaging and taking on debt just to live their lives. They'll never make enough to pay off the debt, but they'll make enough to make payments until they die. A whole generation that accrues no real capital that isn't potentially collateral.

So we created a better system. A system ruled by code, not businessmen and politicians. You cannot argue with code. Imagine if the constitution was able to be coded into the fabric of reality. If it could have been there would be no arguments over the intention of the constitution, it would just execute itself according to code.

This new system is ruled by code, and not just any code. This code combined multiple breakthroughs in cryptography and computer science to create something almost beyond code. This code once released into the wild began managing human behavior, by promise of reward, not fear of debt. The interaction between the code, the internet, and the human brain has created a new economy managed by this code.

The code is incredibly intricate and complex, but there are some easy to understand principles that are consequences of the way the code is executed.

There are a finite number of units within this network. At any given time the number of units in existence is indexed and the rate of creation (inflation) of those units is on a known and unchangeable schedule.

The units can only be transferred by use of a private key. Funds cannot be stolen unless the thief finds your private key. Thus security of wealth no longer relies on physical protection but the ability to keep a well guarded secret. Keys can be stored in your brain.

No government or organization can stop an individual from propagating a transaction.

Every unit transfer is recorded in an immutable database that stretches back to the moment that unit was created.

The code creates an immutable database. The data cannot be manipulated by any human ever. This is the first time in the history of humanity we have created a way to record history without having history be re-written continually by the victors of war.

The economy based on debt, war, and coercion is reaching its inevitable end. The people are no longer able to repay their debts globally, cutting each economy off from each other in a downward spiral. There is no reason to believe that Superman, Jesus, Aliens, or some politician is going to save us from the consequences of humanity's poor decision making. Digital USD are worthless if you believe in the basic economics of supply and demand. The supply is arbitrarily infinite, that is why they work so hard to keep the demand high by keeping everyone in debt. We need their money to pay back to them to buy goods and services from other people.",cryptocurrency,1436458618

personalfinance,Does paying down my mortgage count as re-balancing? Think I should do it? Partly? Why or why not?,"Right now all my assets are either stocks, cash or my home.  I don't have any bonds.  I don't think now is a good time to invest in bond funds, because I think interest rates are going to rise for the foreseeable future. 

However, I feel like I am currently over-invested in stocks, and now is probably a good time to re-balance.   So what are the advantages and disadvantages of selling some of my stocks to pay down my mortgage?

Here are some more details:

* Stocks are currently 57% of my net worth (40% locked in retirement accounts, and 17% is in a non-retirement brokerage account).  They are exclusively in index funds (mix of large cap US/small cap US/international)
* Cash is 13% of my net worth, none of it earning more than 1% interest, though about half is in regular savings accounts and half in CDs.   (A 12-month emergency fund would be 5% of my net worth, so I have excess cash.)
* House is 49% of my net worth.  Mortgage is 19% of my net worth, so net value in home is 30% of my net worth. 

I'm 45 years old, 18 years left on the mortgage.  Interest rate is 3.25%.  I'm in the US.  

As you can see, the taxable portion of my stock portfolio is about equal to my mortgage.   So I'm considering selling some or all of my stocks, paying the capital gains tax, and using the rest to pay down my mortgage.

I would intend to structure it so that any reduced mortgage payment would be diverted to re-purchasing stock on weekly dollar-cost-average basis.

In case it's relevant, I am also vested in a defined-benefit pension that I expect to cover about 30% of my income in retirement.

Any tips about how to think about this?  Am I missing any key considerations?  I'm particularly wondering about a) tax considerations and b) the likelihood that US stocks are not likely to rise dramatically from current prices.  If you were in my position would you keep the whole mortgage as is, pay down only some of it, or pay down none of it?

Thanks for any advice!",finance,1436462527
personalfinance,rent vs buying a place in Los Angeles,"Hey guys I have a dilemma and I don't really know who to ask tbh

My gf and I just graduated school last year, and we make a decent income (120k each), with about 120k in loans each. We're both mid-late 20's. We're currently renting at 1800, and looking for a house to buy around 400k. I'm wondering if we should wait to save more money to get a downpayment now (have about 40K saved up).  We want to get a place because it feels like we're just wasting money by renting.

Our realtor said we can get an interest rate of 4.375% with a 40K downpayment for a 400K townhome. The monthly mortage+HOA+fees would be about 3K/month.

I want to get them paid off, but I am also worried about not being able to find employment right after graduation. I'm thinking I might need more of a savings if it takes me a few months to find a job.

personalfinance,Advice on debt - Federal Student Loan to pay off credit cards?,"Long story short (list of debt at bottom, i understand paying debt with debt is dumb but hear me out), I moved out of state almost 3 years ago and racked up close to 7000 in debt.  I have high interest rates and can only put minimum payments which equal around $200 a month + $150 extra a month on card payments.  I always put the extra amount on the higher APY.  

I started going to school last year and it was fully paid for with grants.  This upcoming semester I will be about $400 short with grants each semester.  My awards letter stated I qualified for a federal sub and unsub loan.  Together they equal 7000ish dollars over the 2 semesters (can i take both? havent called the aid department yet).

Currently in an FHA 30y fixed @4.5 (5 years into repayment on ~220K purch price property, 195K remaining)- house now under 78% LTV per current appraisals (~260K+), but I can't remove my ~$85/month MIP yet due to original price putting LTV near 90%.  I'd like to refi, but due to my current DTI i need to ditch another property before I could get a conventional, so I'm curious about maybe doing an FHA streamline refi.  After ditching the other property for a loss, I'm probably going to have to immediately take out a HELOC against my current property to offset some temporary credit lines being used to get out of the other property, so getting a coventional ~95%LTV refi with cash back and slightly higher interest rate may not be a feasible option for me either.

I'd like to do something to get rid of the MIP, and the lower interest rates are somewhat appealing, but my job situation is such that I may have to sell in a couple years, so I don't have a long window to make any up-front costs back.  Would the streamline refi costs completely negate any MIP/Interest savings I would get over the course of a couple months, or could the streamline refi costs be so low that it might be worth it to me?

personalfinance,I need advice: which debts do I repay first after receiving inheritance?,"I’m 25, and I’m finally at the age where I will inherit what is left in a trust fund that my dad left to me when he passed away in ’08. I will have somewhere between $3-5k available after I use the vast majority of the trust to pay back my aunt and uncle who covered most of my college education. I also will be receiving money from a CD that vested last year that my grandmother left me when she passed, which has about $6k in it.

I currently have a car loan with $8.8k left on it, at a 9.95% interest rate (I financed through the dealership, you can harp on me for that, I’ve learned my lesson). I also have two student loans at $5.9k (6.8% interest) and $2.3k (3.4% interest). I have 2 negative marks on my credit report right now because I missed one payment on each of those student loans. It’s bringing my FICO score down to just below 600.

So r/personalfinance, what I’m wrestling with is, which debts do I pay off first with the money I’m inheriting (~$10k altogether)? I’ll note here that I already have an emergency fund with ~$10k, and I contribute to a Roth 401k at my job with employer matching.
 
The way I see it I have these options to consider:

Option A – Pay off student loans, credit score goes up, continue to pay off car loan, refinance car loan eventually once credit score is up (I have tried refinancing in the past few months but got denied because of credit score)

Option B – Pay off car loan, and use the extra money not going towards the car payment to pay off student loans, negative marks remain on credit report",finance,1436472002

I am looking for a card that will last me a long time with low interest rates, a low (preferably no) annual fee, and that will have greater rewards over time (as in besides higher spending limits, I want to say turn my Blue Cash Amex into a Centurion thirty years from now.) Also, how dumb/hard would it be to pay for a combination of the two (Chase Amazon and Blue Cash Amex for example)? Does it really matter which credit card I start out with if I can just switch later in life?

personalfinance,Seeking advice about living situation.,"Hi /r/personalfinance, thanks for taking the time to check out my post. I'm new to this sub so I apologize if I'm asking the wrong questions.

Basically, I'm hoping to get some advice about my living situation from a financial perspective. I'll explain my situation in as much detail as I can. I'm a graduate student who lives in the province of Ontario (Canada). I am finishing up my studies and will be starting work in a month in the same town where I currently go to school. My SO and I have lived together for a few years. She will be starting medical school (in the same town) in a few months, which means she'll be here in town for at least four more years as well. We are both 24 years old.

I'll be making a modest income at my job and I have about $8000 in student loans to pay off. I currently have about $15,000 in savings (if you're wondering, I haven't paid off the loans yet because they're interest-free until six months after I finish school). My SO is currently debt-free and also has some savings, however the standard method of financing medical school is to take out a six-figure line of credit with a bank at the prime interest rate, and that is likely what she will be doing. Overall, we could realistically put between $20,000-$30,000 towards a down payment for a mortgage if we wanted to.

We currently live in an apartment which costs us $825 per month ($412.50 each) in rent, which is very low compared to typical rent costs in our area. We're comfortable here, but it is a bit small and it's in an old building, so we've been toying with the idea of getting a house at some point in the next year. There's also the classic appeal that mortgage payments would go towards an investment whereas we don't get anything back from the rent money we pay.

Neither one of us has any idea how home buying and mortgages work, so I figured I'd ask for some tips on this subreddit. I'd love for any general advice and tips you have about whether or not we should consider buying and how to get started if we should, but I'll also list off some questions:

1. As I mentioned above, we could probably put a $20,000-$30,000 down payment on a house. With my income and my SO's line of credit, we could probably handle a $1500 per month mortgage payment. What price range of houses would we be looking at? What if we could increase the down payment to $40,000 by saving up some more? The houses that we like seem to be in the $350,000 range; when could we realistically afford a house in that price range?

2. Is now a good time to buy a house? What about a year from now? Three years from now?

3. It is likely that our combined income will increase over the next five years (since my SO will be a doctor and my income has the potential to grow). If we can only afford a long-term mortgage now, but suddenly are able to make much larger payments in five years, can we change the terms of the mortgage to pay it off faster (and with less interest)? Or are we locked in when we first sign the mortgage agreement?

4. If we have to move before the house is paid off, can we sell it?

5. Should we even be considering buying, or should we just keep renting?

6. If we buy, where do we start?",finance,1436478388

personalfinance,"Capital One refuses to lower my credit card interest rate of ~22%. My FICO score is 775. I've had the card for 6 years, never missed a payment. Is my only option to apply for a new line of credit?","Pardon the rambling/ranting. I just got off the phone with Capital one. Here's the backstory:

6 years ago I signed up for a Capital One credit card before studying abroad since they were about the only company that didn't charge foreign transaction fees. I was a college student with limited credit history and not much income. They offered me a $1,000 line of credit with a 22% APR. That's fair and understandable given the credit risk that I was in 2009.

Well, I've been using that card almost exclusively for the last six years and paying it off in full every month. In that time I've also paid off my student loans and an auto loan. With no late payment and very low credit utilization, my FICO score is now at 775.

I recently applied for an AMEX card (I'm moving, have to buy some furniture and 15 months @ 0% is a nice deal) and was approved for the lowest advertised rate of 12.9%. That got me thinking about my Capital One interest rate, so I called them. After speaking with a supervisor, the best they can offer is a temporary APR reduction to 18% (for seven months, then it shoots back up). Unacceptable.

Based on the offer that AMEX gave me, I'm pretty sure if I applied for a *new* card through Capital One I'd be given the lowest advertised rate, and probably a higher credit limit. So why the hell are they refusing to give me a reasonable offer on my existing account?

In truth, the interest rate doesn't matter because I pay the balance every month. However, emergencies happen sometimes If I ever do have to carry a balance, it would be nice to know that my rate isn't absurd. I don't want to apply for another line of credit because I want to avoid a hard inquiry that might adversely affect my FICO score. But maybe that's my only option.

Has anyone ever had success negotiating a lower APR? If so, how? I'm pretty pissed, honestly. If the only way to a lower interest rate through Capital One is to apply for *more* credit, then I'll be applying through a different company purely out of spite.",finance,1436482460

Weekly take home: 800 (after maxed out company matching 401k contribution)

 I own an older car that is very unreliable (2002) but should theoretically last a few more years with some maintenance. I just want to be prepared for the worst. A pipe dream of mine is to buy the &lt;35k Tesla when it comes out. Buying a new car is not something I ever thought I would consider but the gas savings plus my hippie/techie nature draw me to it. 

I also want to buy a house. I like my job enough to stay in the area for at least a few years if not settle permanently. I don't know anything about buying a house and don't even know how to start thinking about what I can afford. I wouldn't mind something smaller/cheaper at all, I basically live in college housing now and as you can tell from my rent its a VERY cheap area to live in. I just hate renting and having roommates (currently have 5 and though I love them it's a lot) and not being able to have pets or the freedom to just fix things if they're broken. I feel like I'm throwing my hard earned money away. My lease is up in June so I need to decide if me and two of my roommates want to rent somewhere else for another year or if I want to try to forge out on my own.

I currently live about a 25 miles from work so I both spend a lot of time in the car and want to live closer. Though if I fix one the other would be much easier to deal with :)

Am I over confident in my ability to afford these things I want in the next few years? either the house or the nice car. I'm looking mostly for opinions on priorities. I'm hoping to have the student loans knocked out by the end of the lease so I can redirect that money into whatever housing I wind up in.

personalfinance,(US) Looking for guidance regarding private student loans,"Hello PF,

TL;DR Private student loans suck, what should one look for when taking them?

I have been browsing this subreddit for a while now and haven't been able to find much information about what I need some help with. It seems the general consensus here is that taking private student loans is a terrible idea, and given what I've heard I am inclined to agree. What I haven't been able to find is information for those who are forced into the position to take private student loans.

I want to avoid taking any private student loans but I want to prepare myself for what to look for when approaching a lender. Taking one of these would be a last ditch for funding education before going home due to being broke.

For example, with whom should a student finance privately? I bank with Wells Fargo and have considered them as an option, I haven't explored anything specifically but because I bank with them they are somewhat familiar to me. I keep hearing references to Sallie Mae, Navient, etc. Who are they, are they reasonable options?

What are acceptable rates for private student loans? I have some sub and unsubsidized student loans out now (they are in good standing, I’ve been paying more for them than I’ve asked for since I finished my AA) that have rates varying from 3.4 to 6.8 percent. Obviously the lower the better, but what is the average rate or even a good one outside of that range? Are the private loan rates usually fixed like my federal loans, or set up to vary in rate for the lender to make more money off of me? What kinds of repayment terms are usually available, 60 mos., 120mos.? Do these types of loans usually offer deferment for six months after graduation?

I really know nothing about loan financing and have no one to turn to for the advice I need. My parents haven’t financed anything since before I was born or shortly thereafter, their financial habits are horrendous anyway. Paycheck to paycheck stuff, never getting caught up because of frivolous spending, impulse buys, late fees and paying 2-3 months of a utility plus the late fees at a time; all while missing one of the current utilities for the next month’s round of forced over payment.

Can anyone supply a crash course in the taking a private student loan? I know many of the answers to my questions will vary depending upon the institution with which the loan may be taken, but I want to know what to ask for to not be taken advantage of. Thanks in advance!",finance,1436491645
personalfinance,"Gifted individual stocks as a minor - now that I'm of age, should I sell them and move the funds to Vanguard?","Hey PF!

When I was born, a few family members purchased investments for me under UTMA (NY) with my parents. These holdings (both DRIP plans with large corporations) are currently in an account with Computershare, and total about $5,700.

Now that I'm of age, I've opened an individual account with Vanguard and put a few thousand dollars of my savings into a LifeStrategy Growth fund, which I hope will outpace the interest rate of my savings account during my college years before I begin contributing to my retirement savings when I enter the workforce. 

From what I've read on this sub, it would probably be beneficial to me to diversify, sell the individual DRIP holdings and move those funds into my account with Vanguard. Am I on the right track here? Are there any tax liabilities or extra paperwork that I need to be concerned about or otherwise affected by?

Also, this may all be a moot point due to the UTMA status of the account these holdings are in. I have full access to the account and seem to be able to execute transactions - will I be able to do this now or will I have to wait until I'm 21?

personalfinance,Best place to park cash?,"I have a growing savings amount and am thinking about the best place to put the extra cash.

My key ideas are:

(1) high interest savings account (ING Direct offer 3.50%pa interest)

(2) Investing in a diversified stock portfolio through exchange traded funds (ETFs) through a passively managed robo-advisor

The problem I have is that the high interest account pays 3.5% without any stress (subject to interest rate movements). Every day I can see my little pool of money going up by a few dollars and it's nice.

personalfinance,PSA: Your APR is not your real interest rate,"The APR that's advertised is typically lower than your ""effective interest rate"" due to intra-year compounding.  Credit cards typically compound monthly, while student loans compound daily.

Example:  5% APR, Compounded *daily* = 5.13% Effective

Example 2: 25% APR, Compounded *monthly* = 28.1% Effective

Banks advertise APR on their lending products because it appears lower.  They advertise APY (annual percentage yield, aka effective) for their investment products because it appears higher.

I am a 19 year old college student. Up until 5/31 I was enrolled in Medicaid in Florida, but now I do not qualify. I am on my own as my dad is dead and my mom isn't in a position to help me financially. I am a Junior studying accounting and will graduate December 2016. Tonight I decided to look at healthcare.gov, and according to that I qualify for a subsidy of ~$120/month. That was based upon the income I put in of approximately $13,000 a year. The thing is that that number could change, though I have the power to make sure it always stays above the FPL. My income consists of:
~$3200: Work income, I work part time over the summer and during school
~$15000 in Scholarships and grants
So this totals to about $18000 in income, if I claimed no qualified educational expenses such as tuition and books. 
My QEE are equal to about $10,000, so I have the ability to reduce my income by any amount between $0 and $10,000.

So based on what healthcare.gov told me, I qualify for a special enrollment period, and that with the credit I can at least get low cost health insurance for free. The free plan has a deductible of $6300 and is overall terrible, but the insurance plan for me would just basically be protection against total financial ruin if a car accident or other tragedy occurs. 
I just want to make sure that I actually qualify for the credit and won't have to pay it back when I file taxes. 
Other relevant financial facts, I have about $9,000 in cash, with $6,750 in student loans. The loans are being taken out with the intent to use it for my masters program which may or may not be paid for. These are subsidized federal loans which are not accruing interest. These are currently in the Barclays online savings account earning 1% interest.

Both mine and my husband's credit is in the 400s. Also not here to explain or debate that - it is much too long a story and the only relevant part is that we have learned our lesson and are on the slow road to recovery. 

We will have to pay out the nose in interest rates, I'm sure, but we don't have the cash to buy a new (used, but new to us) car. We DO have the income to sustain a car payment, but is it worth it to get a more reliable car AND help his credit score improve?

* My own pocket money (equivalent to CAD 350 or 400, don't remember how much I'd saved) is holed up back home in India in a short term fixed deposit that I'd asked my parents to set up for me. It made sense not to bring it to Canada because of the higher interest rates.

* I have enough money at hand in Canada to pay for about 5 months of rent, utilities (cellphone and wired internet), and transport. Any remaining would probably get used up on food. I have a savings account, a chequeing account, and a credit card in a Canadian bank. Right now I've kept my savings account empty, but with the amount my dad recently sent me (part of the 5 months rent mentioned above), I'm thinking of setting aside the 5 months of rent (about CAD 5500) and putting them in the savings so that I can (hopefully) get a teeny bit of money generated.

financialindependence,Moving Apartment Question,"TL;DR   
I am currently in an okay, if cheap, apartment now which would require me to drive to work in the winter for my new job.  At what point is it worthwhile to move into a more expensive apartment to be able to walk about half a mile to work?  Please bear in mind I really **really** hate driving in the winter because where I live we get quite a bit of snow and ice and it just stays for weeks on end.  At no point is public transportation an option: there is no service out where I will be working.

**Details**

So this is a question of $ versus convenience I will admit, I am looking for feedback on it anyway.

Current apartment:  
$575/month, $35/month parking, ~$10/month electric bill, $35/month internet, ~$42/month estimated city tax broken into monthly, ~$62.5/month from $0.10/mile in fuel driving to work (0.1 * 25 miles * 25 days )  = **$759.5/month**

Example apartment:  
$800/month, $35/month parking, ?? (utter guess $20) electric, $35/month internet = **$890/month**

*(As a disclaimer, yes I know that the federal rate for mileage is $0.50/mile and I am only using $0.10 for fuel.  It is technically possible for me to bike to work from current location, however since that is over 12 miles each way not easy and not every day.  If I were to assume worst case of I drive to work every day and I use $0.50/mile then instead of $759.5/month the current apartment would be $1,009.5 which is greater than the example apartment which.... does not ""feel"" right)*

So why the hell would I look at paying $130.5/month more???  I live in a state which has crappy winters.  No, they are not the worst in the country, not by a long shot, but we get plenty of snow and ice which just stays on the ground for weeks.  I got stuck in the driveway at the apartment last year, had a lot of trouble getting into the driveway due to the slope multiple times, and would need to drive to work in the winter as it is over 12 miles each way from my current location.  The apartment itself is okay, but on the cheap end of things.  Floors creak, I need to physically leave the building to reach where the washer is for laundry, lots of little things like that.

The apartment I am quoting for $ as an example would be 0.6 miles from where I would be working and I have no problem walking that even in the middle of winter.  There is *no* bus service which passes by where I will be working so the options in winter would be walk or drive and there is only so much distance I am willing to walk when the temperature goes below freezing.  I would not need to pay taxes to 2 different cities.  The reason the estimated city tax only exists in the current apartment is that the apartments I am looking at would be in the same city I will be working in which that tax comes out of my paycheck either way.  The example apartment also has a bunch of fluffy expensive stuff like fitness room, maintenance on site (the maint for current apartment is actually in a different location and they drive out here every so often), and just plain nicer.  I will say that the reason I am unsure about electric cost is that the example apartment includes all utilities other than electric, however I do not know if the stove and heat are electric or gas...

Yes a roommate would make this a cheaper option.  I just spent the last 4 months with roommates in another location and while it went okay overall for a short time I do not want to live with other people (exception being potential S.O. in the future).

Just to throw more onto this wall of text, the mileage part I added in italics was not realized until I was already typing this out.  Depending on if I am missing things like insurance (which went up when I moved into current apartment due to higher accident rates here) the reality might be that it makes financial sense to move which seems ridiculous.  Last piece of info: I will be making $23/hour which is $47,840 pre-tax, however I am expecting there to be overtime (HR actually quoted the following number as an anticipated salary) giving just above $53,000/year due to overtime being time and a half.

So, my mortgage guy was mentioning that I have an option to do an Inflation Hedge Strategy where I add to my mortgage payments each year... in theory, I can pay off my mortgage a LOT faster by adding $50-100 each year to my mortgage payments (which wouldn't affect me too badly because I get a cost of living increase every year).

The second option would be to hold the extra payment in a separate account and they will add it as an excess payment to my mortgage at year-end - count it as part of my 15% topup allowance each year.

Since first discovering this sub I have learnt a lot of valuable information and for the first time in my life I am becoming, or have become, financially responsible. One of the things I have done is set up an emergency fund that currently has $10,000 in it. This is the most I have ever saved in my life and I'm pretty proud of that.

Anyway, I spoke today to my bank about interest for the account. Apparently it has a higher rate of interest if I never withdraw from the account and add to it each month (which I do). This is where I am now confused. The bank rep told me the interest rate is 2.89% calculated daily. What exactly does this mean? I had a very hard time understanding her. Basically it breaks down to: at $10,000 each month I'll make around $25 interest, or approximately $300 per year.

In my mind I thought 2.89% would mean I'd make $2.89 per each $100, or rather around $289 per month. Why are my figures so off?

2) What would be the best way to structure how much I need to pay over the years, I'd want to end up the same as those ""Payed off x-dept in x-months!"" posts
3) What are the best terms for loans (fixed, variable) - If I recall fixed is better 99% of the time?

personalfinance,"Random student loan that doesn't belong to us, being debited from bank account without our permission","Hi all. Looking for a little help with student loans in a nontraditional sense. My husband and I both have graduate school student loans that we have been paying down in a snowball fashion. We have been diligently managing these since graduation in 2010 - it's impossible not to, given the debt load. We keep very close track of our finances so this really pisses me off. This question in particular has to do with his GradPlus loans.

In 2008 &amp; 2009, he took out a Grad Plus loan for each year - about $30k each, through Chase. Chase transferred these both to MyFedLoan in 2010. We paid off the 2008 loan in full in 10/2012. We have about $10k to go on the 2009 loan.

Meanwhile, he is also paying off a small student loan from undergrad through a company called AES (American Education Services). Over the last month, a new loan popped up on AES due for repayment in the amount of $11k that is listed as a GradPlus from 2008. It says this loan comes from JP Morgan Chase. WTF? He does not have ANY other GradPlus loans from 2008. He only took out exactly what was submitted to him in the budget for GradSchool, so we have no idea where this loan is coming from. We have researched his credit report as well as the National Student Loan Data System which has no record of this loan being owed. What makes us even madder is that they have taken $109 out of our bank account without our permission listed as a ""Cosigner/Endorser payment."" Neither of us authorized this transaction. His cosigner is his 86 y/o demented grandmother who is now on hospice, who certainly does not have our bank account information. All of our loans are on auto-debit, so the only manual payments we ever make are extra payments when we can for the snowball effect. The loan is NOT on auto-debit - it even says so on the AES website. There is no information provided to us as to how they got authorization to take this payment out. It's like they just took the information they had on file for his undergrad loan (which is listed on auto-debit) and went for it.

He is at work this afternoon and plans on calling the company when he gets off work. They said they won't talk to me because I'm not the primary loan holder or cosigner. He is majorly stressing - we have such a handle on our mutual debt till this issue. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? I am so annoyed that we have to deal with this, let alone that money is being taken out of our account without our permission.

Edited to add: This loan cannot belong to me either - all of our student loan debt is completely separate. We did not know each other at the time that these loans were obtained.",finance,1436541673
personalfinance,BofA transferring a portion of my available credit to new card. Any credit impact?,"I called BofA to have the interest rate lowered on my legacy MBNA-issued 26.99% credit card.  Rather than reducing the interest rate, they said that they could provide me with a new Americard Rewards card with an interest rate of 16.99% and transfer my entire $20K+ credit limit (no outstanding balance) over.  I was concerned that zero-ing out the credit limit on the MBNA card would close the account which I’ve had for 17 years, so I had them transfer all but $5K of my credit limit to the new card.

(Ontario, Canada) I am looking for some general guidance and suggestions regarding starting a Savings Account.  I have about $5000 I am looking to place into savings account and was looking at these two accounts:

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Every Day Savings Account﻿:**

-Unlimited free transfers to your personal deposit accounts.

-Interest paid on every dollar, calculated daily.

-No monthly account fee.

**Interest rate:**

$0 - $4,999.99  - 0.10%

$5,000+  - 0.10% 

**Monthly account fee:** None 

**Transfers:**  Free

**Debit transactions:**  One free Debit Transaction per month / $2.00 for each additional Debit Transaction
 
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**High Interest Savings Account﻿:**

-Premium interest rate, interest calculated daily.

-All Transaction Fees waived if minimum monthly balance of $25,000 is maintained.

-No monthly account fee

**Interest rate:**

$0 - $4,999.99  - 0.00%

$5,000+  - 0.80% 

**Monthly account fee:**  None 

**Transfers:**  $5.00 or Free with $25,000 minimum monthly balance

**Debit transactions:**  $5.00 per Debit Transaction or Free with $25,000 minimum monthly balance

&amp;nbsp;


With this data it would seem like my best option would be the High Interest as it has a .80% interest rate on anything over $5,000? I have no intentions of transactions however would be making deposits by transfers. 

If these options are not the best, would anyone else know any other suggestions? I unfortunately just started looking into this today.

personalfinance,Buyings vs. Renting vs. Snowballing,"Hello /PersonalFinance,

Background story:

I am 26 Yrs Old, married with 2 kids. With all the curve balls life has thrown our way, we are currently up to our neck in debt (school loans + 2 cars). That said, we are currently snowballing our debt, and will have everything paid off in just 4 short years. I am trying to decide if it would be better to purchase a house now, or wait 5 years when we can muster a decent down payment. I have a few scenarios I'm considering.

Debt break down:

* 7 Loans (5 School, 2 Auto)

* Snowballing Payments has us debt free in exactly 4 years ($1270 a month)

* Will pay roughly $7252 in interest on loans over the next 4 years


Current Costs

* $800 a month in groceries (includes baby needs)

* $110 insurance

* $180 utilities

* $600 Day Care

* $650 Rent

* $1270 Debt Payments


Current Income/Savings

* $5317 per month + Overtime when applicable (both very stable jobs)

* $3000 in Savings 

* No other savings/liquidable assets


Facts

* 4 Years till debt free at current rate, opening $1270 of extra income

* Able to afford $400 more a month towards either debt or mortgage

* Would be getting a 0% down home loan (only cover closing costs), leading to a required PMI charge (quoted around $150 a month)

* Expect to get an interest rate of 3%-4%

* Looking at homes in the range of $150,000 (quoted around $1150/mo includes mortgage+escro+$150 PMI)

* Would stay in home for 5 years, once our debt is paid off looking at homes in the $200,000+ range.

* Qualify for **First Time Home Buyers** grant

* This is in Louisville, KY

* Most Important Wife is very ready to get out of our apartment, and into ANY home.

Should We

**Keep Renting** @ $650 a month, and add the $400 to our snowball plan, bringing us to 3 years until debt free, then save for the home we want ($200,000+)

**Buy Now** @ $1150+ a month, and continue our current snowball plan of 4 years.


Main Dillema:

Over 5 years (required for first time home buyers), would the opportunity for building equity + the tax incentives, outweigh the opportunity to eliminate all of our current debt in only 3 years instead of 4 ($7252 in interest over 4 years, only roughly $5000 over 3.)

personalfinance,Car Dealer Trying To Change APR After Contract Is Signed,"I recently purchased a 2015 Honda Fit (hold your applause). Yesterday, I get a call from the dealership saying I need to come back in a new contract because I don't qualify for the APR on the original contract. Do I have any legal responsibility to do this? What are their options in pursuing this matter further? Can the bank reposes the car?

I went in to the dealership with a pre-approved car loan from Capital One with an APR of 1.99-7.99 depending on the car I chose. Based on the VIN of the car I bought Cap One told me the interest rate would be 2.45%. However, the finance guy didn't know this and never bothered looking up my pre-approved loan.

When negotiating, the dealer/finance guy was very aggressive in persuading me to take the dealer loan and almost refused to use my Cap One loan. He offered to do something called an Option Loan but I'm unfamiliar with option loans, felt skeptical and declined while re-asserting that I wanted to use the Cap One loan as opposed to the dealer loan. It was all very combative.

After going back-and-forth for a while he (seemed) concede on the matter saying, ""fine, you want 1.99%"" and adjusted some numbers and printed the contract. I agreed and signed it.

NOW... he's calling me saying his bank couldn't do the 1.99% and I need to go back down there and sign a new contract with a higher APR or get Capital One to send them a check. Anything I could've done to avoid this? Was I foolish in thinking the finance guy could so easily adjust my APR? What should I do?

I have checked financial calculators and for my interest rate with my balance, 10 years should be $650/month. I have been paying $650/month for the last 14 months. I have also put $4000 down in October. I rechecked my loans to see where I was at and it said I still had 113 months left (9.4 yeaars). From what I calculated, I should be under 9 years left on my loan.  
  I was of coursed confused and called the service line for Navient (who has now taken over sallie mae). Two representatives told me that I am actually on a ICR plan with 139 months. The thing is, I called a year ago to verify I was on the 10 year plan. The representative at that time, that I was on the standard 10 year plan.
Back to the current representative I was talking to. She said if I were to switch to the 10 year standard plan, I would owe $704/month and it will be 94 months (7.8 years) left.  
  I don't understand. How can it be that the standard loan payment should be $650 according to calculations but yet on this ICR I already am paying $650 for a longer period of time? Why does me going on the standard plan now go up to $704? The representative said it could be from consolidation but doesn't have the paperwork because they just took over the company. What consolidation could cause this? Or are they just taking my money for no reason?
If I am right, I'm going to pay up to $7k+ of extra money.

Parents not in the mood to explain.,"I'm from an extremely low income family (less than $20000 annual income) and going to college. For my first year, this is the cost (estimated)


Total cost of attendance: $25.5k

Grants: $13k

Loans taken under my name: $5.5k (3.5k sub and 2k unsub)

So I'm short about $7k


I looked at the Parent PLUS loans option and found them to be evil. Extra high fee and interest rates and I think if my parents take them they'll spend their life crying, unable to pay. I probably won't be able to help either.


Mom said the family's been saving tax refunds and have some money that can be used to help me with that $7k amount. But she says something about the government knowing that we ""suddenly"" have more money and will cut our Medicaid and stuff. Something like when the gov't sees the family for no reason transfer a big amount of money between family members' bank accounts will cause problems. This belief also has her and my dad never have an amount in their bank accounts that exceed $2000. Which I find ridiculous. And to my knowledge tax refunds are money obtained legally so we have the right to save them or do whatever.


I'd appreciate any explanations about this. Thanks.


[**Rant**. You don't have to read. I just want to get some thoughts out.]

When I asked for more details she said she's not sure about the legal aspect of this and I'm of course not either. Our family, every time we have a conservation, especially one about money, will probably leads to arguments, frustration, emotional distress, etc.


I don't know how others are dealing with it, but I feel like someday our family won't be able to survive. I don't understand their plan. How do they plan to live with such a low amount of income. I thought it's not my fault since I'm under 18 and shouldn't worry about family's finance. Now I feel like I should have taken action doing something. We came to the country a few years ago and while other immigrants have been doing relatively well, we still have nothing. Lack of English fluency's also a problem. Most of the problems that occur are, of course, related to money. I dream to use my education to become at least a middle class person later on. But all of this is really making me feel guilty and unhappy. I had the option to choose other schools with lower costs; I chose this school because I liked it the most and it's where I feel comfortable going. I'm questioning my belief and aspirations. Had I chosen the school in the city, which is not really good for my major, but still not bad, I don't have to pay for housing and I can even get some money from grants for my own use by buying old textbooks, etc.


I have this feeling that our poor family (and other poor families) won't ever be able to be less poor. It's a perpetual cycle. No money -&gt; no education -&gt; poor -&gt; poorer. While the rich is getting richer and richer. Unless somebody makes a breakthrough, like I have to be Bill Gates or some genius, which I'm not, the cycle won't ever be over.


I feel like I deserve better and the country should provide me with free education. After all, I'm a good person and I'm sure I'll be able to help this society. At the same time, I'm not feeling good for putting my parents/family through this and I also understand that the USA (or any other countries) is not a country where you get everything for free without working. Coming here doesn't mean your life will be a lot better. And that's totally reasonable. I just don't know what I should do.",finance,1436562545

Thank you!

*Update*
After speaking with Navient and advising that I am in a better financial position to repay the loan, they advised that I have one of two options.
1) Accept a settlement amount and pay $2825.00
2) Pay a $1500 down payment and my monthly payments will be $100.00 at an interest rate of .01% so the bulk of the monthly payment will be paid to the principal.
My current total loan balance is $5137.75 and is in default as of June 30th.

At this point, neither option is viable for me. I can afford the $100 monthly payment but not the down payment. Can any of you expand on similar experiences with Navient and how they were resolved? I have an assigned account manager but she doesn't seem to want to help and could only offer the two settlements detailed above.

I reckon he turned to retail therapy to cope with the massive transition. He started buying all these electronics that he can't pay off. There's a pile of old laptops, cameras, and tablets that he buys from ebay. Maybe he was trying to fix them up and resell them but it seems unsuccessful to me. He also used to play the lottery, but he swears he's stopped.

He has about 6 credit cards. There's one from eBay, Macy's, Sam's Club, and I don't even know what else. Each card probably has a debt of around $6000-$8000. I saw his bill once, and his interest rate was 22%. That's crazy.

In order to deal with payments, he borrows money from my mom. She's very strict with money, and has about $20,000 in her savings. She refuses to be dragged into my dad's debt, but relents when he begs her anyway. Recently he asked for $300, but ended up withdrawing $400 from her bank account. She was beyond pissed when she found out. She works 5 days a week sewing clothes at a factory, so she doesn't understand how people can spend their hard earned money on frivolous things. 

My dad genuinely seems like he's trying to pay everything off. He brings ramen to eat at lunch everyday because he doesn't want to spend money on more expensive food. He collects all the cans and bottles from his workplace so he can recycle them for extra money. He works 6 days a week, and usually overtime too, but I guess that's not enough to make minimum payments. 

My mom is sick of his shit and really hates him at this point. She bitches at him practically everyday and they're both super depressed and resentful. He won't be completely transparent with us about how much he owes but I know that he only has $2 in his bank account right now even after borrowing her money, and he usually makes $700 a week. 

So what can I do to help him? I don't even know where to start when he's so secretive and owes so much money.",finance,1436567494

personalfinance,Business Loan,"Hey there, I have an interesting, probably hopeless, situation that I am looking for advice regarding. Here goes:

About 3 years ago a friend and I decided to build a cell phone repair store together. I had no money going into this, he did, I know about computers / electronics / repair, he did not. So we joined forces and opened up a store together. We ended up making the store a hell of a lot nicer than it needed to be and spent about 80 - 100k. Our plans were to make a boat load of money and split it like partners, taking a portion of it to pay back half of what we originally spent like we both had money from the get go.

Fast forward to now, the store does not make boat loads of money, it does well... just not boat good. The problem is since I work about 70 hours a week running the store and fixing everything I end up taking all of the money we make to live. He takes home money sometimes, but at the end of the day it worked out more like me as an employee and him the boss. He has been trying to sell the store for the last year to recover the 100k investment, and gotten a lot of offers, but none for over 80k. He had been holding out for 100k, and now is mentally at his wits end. He wants to bail so bad he put out an offer for 50k to just run away. There are currently 3 people that are going to probably duke it out to take the store away for only 50k.

He says he would rather if anyone takes the store it be me. And he definitely means it, he says if I take it that I get everything in it with it. In the store we have about 20 - 30k in parts, accessories, furnishings, etc. The problem is I have no way to come up with 50k. We went to the bank and my credit is poor so there is no way for me to get a business loan because of that, and no one in my family will help me. I feel like I'm about to miss out the opportunity of a life time. The store would perfectly support a one man operation, and continue to grow like it has into a great business. He doesn't want to wait another day to get out.

Is there anyway to find an investor that would loan 50 - 60k out to someone with bad credit at a high interest rate knowing it's a safe investment?

personalfinance,"Tired with current schooling path, looking at another option (engineering) but confused both financially and path-wise.","Hello Reddit.

&amp;nbsp;


I feel I’m stuck due to financial restrictions. I have been trying to go to school for nursing since I was 21, since then I’ve failed out of two nursing schools (one because I was just clueless in the field and the second because of a back injury and teachers don’t want students with back injuries dropping patients all over the place). Those schools were in community colleges so I was planning on not having student loans and debt. I am currently in a private university for nursing school but I feel so burnt out from nursing in general and just done with the career path. 

&amp;nbsp;


My mother is paying for school and had to take a parent loan for this university along with federal loans. I’ve told her before that I don’t think I can do nursing but she’s convinced that I can’t get a job being anything else because she knows people who have done other career paths that are working minimum wage jobs. Some information about my mother: 65, single parent, working two jobs, desperately waiting for me to finish school so she can retire. And she never lets me forget that last part.

&amp;nbsp;


Nursing school is just difficult because my mind doesn’t work that way. Something that I think I would enjoy is engineering. Not sure which kind yet, but I’m looking at electrical, computer, or mechanical. I feel my mind works better that way and can understand concepts easier. It caught my eye because I enjoyed chemistry in high school, I dabbled in html as well (myspace profiles, haha), and I like building things? (I'm actually fascinated by assembly line machinery). It might not be enough to take it seriously, but I liked it. 

&amp;nbsp;


I’ve been looking at my state university and it will take 4 years to complete any one of those degrees. I’m ready to just bite the bullet and take out a loan. Of course, I’ll take any courses I can at the community college, but I will have to transfer in eventually. Looking at it though, I would be done maybe at around 29 with student loans, don’t know if I would have a decent job to pay it all back efficiently, and how it would affect when I could buy a house, start a family, etc.

&amp;nbsp;


There’s also the matter of health insurance. At 26, I’m cut off from my mom’s and have to find my own. I currently work in a hospital full time and they offer health insurance, but I didn’t sign up for it because I didn’t need it. They have open enrollment before I’m 26 though, so it’s just been on my mind.

&amp;nbsp;


So I work in the patient care side of the hospital, but it’s physically exhausting and I’m planning on finding a place that doesn’t involve running around and/or standing for long periods of time. There’s an aerospace engineering company that my boyfriend’s brother works at that is looking for interns. However, they’re looking for those enrolled in universities. I was wondering maybe about that since I would go to a community college first. Or if anything, do engineering companies allow people to just come in and observe to see if that’s the profession they want to pursue? 

&amp;nbsp;


So what I’m looking for really is a way to approach taking out loans and how I can take charge of my own career path. Any advice is much appreciated.

personalfinance,CC balance transfer options,"I've read through some old posts but I'm still kind of lost and could use some advice. Background: my fiancee (26) and I (31) are putting together a better budget and I'm concerned with her credit card debts/interest rates. We're looking at buying a home within the next 5 years and I'd like to have all previous debts eliminated by that point. She earns $30k and we live pretty modestly.


She has ~$10,000 in debts spread evenly over 3 cards.

*A is a store card with 26.99%; limit of $8k

*B is her primary bank's card with 19.99%; limit of $5.5k

*C is a third-party bank with 16.99%; limit of $4.5k


She called this morning to try to get cards A and B to reduce the APR but they gave her the run-around and never ran her credit (mid-to-high 700s) or lowered the APR. I'm thinking that her best option would be to obtain another card with 0% on balance transfers and use that to transfer cards A and B, but I'm new to this whole credit card debt scenario so I need some help.


So, with that in mind, I have two questions: 

*Should we be looking at transferring all of her cards' balances or is my idea of transferring A and B sufficient? 

*Most cards that I've seen have a 0% balance transfer (usually a fee attached), is there one that stands out above the rest?

personalfinance,22M would like some advice on getting my life back on track.,"Hello personalfinance,


So about four years ago, I was in the beginning of an abusive relationship. The girl I was with pressured me into making some very financially unsound decisions with my life. For starters, she thought that my junker '87 Oldsmobile Cutlass wasn't a good enough car to get us around so she would constantly belittle me and turn a discussion about us possibly getting a newer car into an argument that would spiral out of control. Now at this time I had a lot of health issues and she had a lot of parental issues, so she ended up moving in with me, my father, and my brother to ""be my caretaker"" and to get away from her abusive father. The health issues were the main reason I wasn't able to think clearly enough to drop this girl and move on.


During this time, I was going to school at ASU (I currently live in Arizona and have my entire life), but dropped out due to my health issues. I then began going to an online college to at least do some work while I was sick. Fast forward two semesters and a year later, I was still being pressured into getting us a newer car, so I finally caved. I went an bought a ""barely used"" 2012 Mitsubishi Eclipse on a part-time $8.50/h wage. I was ignorant and did no research on what an Eclipse was worth, so I ended up getting into an $18,000 loan for a $13,000 car with a 16% interest rate. I was basically a slave to this car until I decided to get a full time job, which limited my time for study. I ended up failing out of a semester of college due to working about 50-55 hours a week.


I completely gave up on college and began trying to find jobs that paid a decent wage that I thought I could live on and support my girlfriend on. We both ended up working at an animal rescue, which put even more strain on the relationship (apparently being around each other 24/7 isn't healthy). 


Fast forward about a year later (May 2014), and I was finally healthy again. I began understanding that I was being emotionally abused and decided to break off the relationship. I was left with a $375 +insurance ($140) a month car payment on a barely above minimum wage job. I decided it was time to try and get a different car that was actually something I wanted and not something she wanted, so I stupidly went out and bought a 2015 Ford Fiesta with 6 miles on it. My Fiesta is worth about $15k trade in and I now owe $22k on it due to a minimal down payment, depreciation, and - the biggest factor - trading in my Eclipse while still owing about $5k more than it was worth.


I now work at a job doing Paint Protection Film application and am making $11/h with mileage reimbursement (effectively makes it around $14.50/h). My new girlfriend's father owns this company and said once I'm fully trained I'll make somewhere in the range of $15-18/h. I'm learning quickly so I feel as though he will give me that raise soon, especially since it will benefit his daughter and allow her to get out of the house. A lot of people in the company say that her father will likely give me the company along with the four other companies that he owns once he retires (probably 10-15 years from now).

He will work with me on letting me go to school, though, so my main question is should I stay at this company and play the waiting game or should I go back to school for three years and finish my Computer Software Engineering degree? My secondary question would be.. is there any possible way to get out of the hole I've created with my car? I don't want to be paying almost $500 a month for transportation anymore, but I doubt I can do anything other than being lucky enough to have someone ram into me and total it (I have gap insurance) to get out of the hole on that thing.

I went from no credit out of college to quickly bad credit because I let a 1500$ student loan (not one of these giant ones I see in this subforum thank God) default. This was paid off through garnishing the rest out of my return this year.

At the same time, I'd love to throw some money at the new toy right now instead of waiting while simultaneously also building my credit. This is why I started thinking about personal loans.

Here is where I guess I need advice. I've done some brief research on how much personal loans can cost with poor credit and it looks like I definitely would be in the 20-30% interest rate bracket. I haven't even decided on an amount yet but I am thinking 1k-2.5k. Does getting one through my bank have the potential to lower these exorbitant rates or can I put up something such as my old car for a more reasonable rate? And/or would it be better to do a short term loan?

I own my home, and have a 30 year mortgage with approximately a 4% interest rate. My highest income tax bracket is the 25% bracket, so I effectively have a 3% rate on my mortgage.

According to the terms of the annuity, I only have to pay taxes on the interest in the annuity, which is approximately $10,000 of it.

I don't really like taking on a lot of risk, but I would like to beat inflation if I can. I'm thinking about putting some of the money towards my mortgage, but I also understand that the whole beauty of a 30 year fixed rate is that as inflation occurs, my payments stay the same.

personalfinance,Resigned - have been given options for defined benefit pension (x-post PFC Canada),"Looking for some feedback on my defined benefit pension plan options that my previous company has given me. The option is to take a calculated net present value of the pension plan and throw it into an RSP or to just take the pension amount at age 65. Details as follows:

1. Net present value - ~$28 000 using the following:
2. Interest rate - 2%
3. Years to retirement - 21 (age 65)
4. Pension amount - ~$4000 / year [I do not believe it is indexed to inflation] and the company only guarantees this amount for 5 years so I could theoretically get nothing after 5 years.


So I did some rough math and figured out that if I take the $28 000 and receive 4% interest, that the amount I would have is ~$65 000 at time of retirement. It would seem that taking the money now is the winner, in my mind. I calculated the future value at retirement, using the ~$4000 / year and in order for the math to work out to a net present value of ~$28 000 today, it seems they plan to only pay out the pension for 12 years in their math.


Now looking at 12 years of $4k annually, the value at retirement is $42k, vs. the $28k invested for 21 years earning 4% interest to arrive at the $64k dollar amount I calculated.

There are several risks or factors to consider: 

1. Will I ever join this company again to use these years to accumulate additional experience to pad up my pension later. The answer is that I do not think so. 
2. The pension is only guaranteed for five years. At five years of payout, the math is even more in favour of taking the cash now as opposed to later. 
3. I'm comfortable with converting a fixed, known cash flow value, to something that is unknown and a higher risk (such as investing in equities). 
4. My expectations on the company being around in 21 years? I'm not so sure. They weren't doing fantastic when I left.

Why Investing Is So Complicated, and How to Make It Simpler

I finally faced up to something I had been dreading.

After years of procrastinating, I logged on to my retirement account. Just working my way through the rigmarole of retrieving lost passwords and locating my investments was bad enough. But once I started to examine my portfolio, I began to feel anxious. Some of my money was in mutual funds, but I had no sense of how I chose them. And the rest of my money was in cash, earning virtually nothing; how had I let it sit there for so long? With trepidation, I began flicking through screen after screen of investment choices, each one filled with a seemingly endless stream of jargon.

I seemed to have fallen into a recurrent nightmare, one in which I am taking a final exam in a class I never attended and a subject I don’t understand. This was even more embarrassing: I am, after all, a trained economist. When new acquaintances learn what I do for a living, they routinely ask, “So how should I invest my money?” I wish I knew.


But this is an ordeal for nearly everyone, whatever their training. No wonder many of us avoid thinking about long-term investments, especially for retirement. A recent survey by Charles Schwab found that most of us spend twice as much time choosing a car as we do choosing investments that are supposed to support us for years.

A relaxing retirement is supposed to be the reward for a lifetime of work, and yet it seems we must pass an entrance exam to reach it.

I’ve been wrestling with how we got to this point. Why is investing so complicated? And what should we do about it in our own lives, and as a society?

Investing isn’t what most of us do for a living. When a mutual fund company asks me what I want to invest in, it seems like the wrong question. It’s like a taxicab driver in a new city asking me, “Which route do you want to take?” Don’t ask. Just take me there. I paid the fare. Is it really my job to figure out the route to my hotel?

I want to reach my retirement with a nest egg that allows me to maintain my current lifestyle and to travel a bit. If I save what I’m supposed to, I would like someone else to figure out the best route.

Employer-provided pensions still do this for you, and if you’re lucky enough to have one — and it’s solid — congratulations. For most of us, though, they are not an option: Pensions have been disappearing, for many reasons. And many of the remaining ones are underfunded and vulnerable. Expanding employer-provided pensions seems to be a non-starter, much as we might like to see that happen.

Can’t the market fix things? If individuals are forced to choose their investments, why doesn’t the market make these choices easier?

By all accounts, the world of mutual funds, which is the basis for many retirement investments, is a competitive market. At the end of 2014, there were more than 20,000 mutual funds. On top of that, there are hundreds of exchange-traded funds. While many of these funds sit in a few big-name companies, one would hardly call this a monopolized industry. We’ve got plenty of choices.

The market seems to work well for consumers in other industries. The producers of smartphones, for example, compete fiercely to make simple and elegant user interfaces. If they can make it a breeze to interact with billions of lines of code, why can’t somebody simplify the alchemy of finance?

What distinguishes the market for investments is our inability to judge whether we have chosen well. Once I’ve used a phone for a few weeks, I can tell whether it was worth the money. By contrast, I may not know for decades (if ever) whether an investment was wise or foolish. Does a low return signal a prudent choice or a missed opportunity? And by the time the answer becomes clear, it’s already too late. You’ve got to live with your bad choice.

What’s more, the invisible hand of competition does not do well by consumers with limited understanding. Rather than eliminating biases, markets often cater to them. For example, many consumers choose a mutual fund by looking at last year’s returns, despite warnings that they should not do so. This creates a winner-take-all situation with the highest-performing funds getting most of the investors. You might think this encourages funds to produce higher returns, and that might seem to be a good thing.

But what it actually produces is a perverse incentive for fund companies to take risks. That’s because investors often choose what to do with their money once, and leave it there for a long time. Faced with that reality, the most profitable strategy for a mutual fund company can be to simply take risks in the hope of gaining high short-term returns. Win this high-return lottery and you can draw many investors from whom you will earn fees for decades. Big families of funds can start new funds regularly, each with a different risk strategy. For the companies, it’s like buying many lottery tickets. It doesn’t matter for the company if many of the funds are clunkers as long as they end up with a few near the top of the performance rankings. For consumers of these funds, though, it’s a losing proposition.

Educating consumers to be better purchasers seems a sensible idea, but an example from recent history illustrates the problem with that. For a long time, the simple investment advice given to consumers has been “buy an index fund.” Index funds are such standardized products — mirroring the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index does not require much management — that just about all of them were initially low cost while offering wonderful diversification.

Consumers have been buying index funds, and the market has responded by providing hundreds of them. Nearly all E.T.F.s are index funds.

But the market has also responded by charging high fees for this standardized product. In 2004, Ali Hortacsu and Chad Syverson, economists at the University of Chicago, found that index funds had as much variability in fees as their more labor-intensive actively managed counterparts. And these fees are nothing to be scoffed at — paying 1 percent more every single year in fees can compound over a lifetime to noticeably lower returns.

Initially sound rules of thumb create niches for bad products — like expensive index funds — that dilute the value of the advice. In short, the market responds to education with attempts to subvert it. Any simple advice tends to have an Achilles’ heel, and markets are good at finding it.

Why not rely on financial advice? There certainly seems to be a yearning for good advice. Last year, I posted a message on Twitter. “Want financial advice?” it said, adding that “@haroldpollack gives it free ... in index card form.” I included Mr. Pollack’s card containing nine pieces of simple advice, such as, “Never buy or sell an individual security. The person on the other side knows more about this stuff than you do.”

The popularity of that tweet shows the thirst for advice.

But while there is a large market for it, financial advice poses many risks.

In one study that I conducted with the economists Markus Noth at Hamburg University and Antoinette Schoar at M.I.T., we tried to quantify the quality of advice on the market. We did this by sending mystery shoppers to financial advisers. Our shoppers received very bad advice, by any measure. They were told to put their money into highly nondiversified portfolios that were also expensive. That’s the worst of both worlds: high risk and low returns. Perhaps most shocking was when our shoppers started with portfolios that were well diversified and inexpensive. Even in those cases, they were told to switch to options that were clearly worse.

But this is not meant to impugn all advisers. The study examined advisers who did not charge clients directly. Their advice was “free,” but under current rules, their advice only had to meet a very low standard — it only had to be “suitable” in a broad sense of that word. So it is O.K., legally, for these advisers to steer you to products that they profit from.

Advisers who explicitly charge for their advice are held to a higher standard. The Department of Labor has recently proposed a rule to require what is known as a fiduciary standard for advice on retirement accounts. At the moment, though, the rules are loose.

If you’re seeking advice, ask yourself one simple question: “If I’m not paying for this adviser, where are they getting their money?” If you don’t know the answer, you may have a problem.


Can we do anything? Regulations requiring that all advisers have a fiduciary duty to their advisees would be a terrific start. But we can do more.

Even if we receive good financial advice, following it can be hard: Saving more and consuming less is on par with going to the gym more and eating less. Some people can do it easily. Many can’t.

A recent study from Ideas42, a behavioral science nonprofit that I helped to start, showed that timely reminders and programs with good default choices can help ensure that good advice is followed. People in well-designed experimental programs who are given sound advice and plenty of reminders tend to save more. We can start more such programs. And in the investment market itself, better standards could make our lives better. When you buy a USB drive or a Wi-Fi router for your computer, for example, you may not really know how they work but you can assume that they will work with each other, because the industry has adopted standards to make sure that this happens. Imagine the nightmare of shopping for electronics products that were incompatible, or that had different names. Standardization is what allows uninformed consumers to shop intelligently for complex products.

For mutual funds, better standards and better labels could simplify choice. For example, suppose the label “Standard S&amp;P 500 Index Fund” was widely used to mean that the fund satisfied certain criteria about transparent pricing, low management fees and limits on trading costs. Consumers buying this fund would know what they were getting.

Firms would be free to introduce new, innovative funds, just as an electronics company can introduce new products that are not USB compatible. The restrictions would only prevent products from claiming to be something they are not.

What’s to be done now? You are on your own, unfortunately.

But I can tell you what I did. I chose a target retirement fund. With these funds, you simply decide on a target retirement year. As you age — and move closer to the target date — these funds automatically shift their holdings from riskier stocks to less risky bonds.

As with the simple advice “buy index funds,” this is also imperfect. If everyone starts buying target date funds, or life-cycle funds, how long before these terms attract companies that create expensive and not-so-effective products? In fact, it may have happened already. As Pierluigi Balduzzi and Jonathan Reuter found and reported in a recent paper, some target date funds may already be taking an expansive view of what it means to invest in equities: They seem to produce a wide range of returns and risks across the year. As a result, I was careful to verify a few things about the fund I chose. First, I made sure that the stocks held by the fund were contained in a simple, broad-based index such as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index or the Russell 2000. Second, I verified that the costs were very low: The annual fees came to less than 0.2 percent. If the fees aren’t obvious, or if they are much higher than this, watch out.

Even armed with this knowledge, there were hiccups. First, choosing the retirement date raised existential quandaries. Since these funds come in increments of five years (2025, 2030 and so on) I ended up choosing two dates to leave me with mental wiggle room. (“I’m not that close to retirement,” I told myself, choosing one fund. “I might want to retire earlier,” I said, choosing another.)

Then I developed a second problem: I was afraid that picking only one kind of fund was imprudent. The economists Shlomo Benartzi at U.C.L.A. and Richard Thaler at the University of Chicago refer to the urge to buy many kinds of funds as “naïve diversification.” One fund can be enough if it’s diversified: What feels like one basket is really a great many baskets.

Overcoming this final hurdle was satisfying. I experienced the kind of euphoria usually reserved for major accomplishments.

The biggest lesson, I realized, was one that faces me all of the time: The biggest cost of fear is paralysis.

It is easy to make a mistake in choosing investments. But in an effort to avoid an error, I had been making an even bigger error. As I procrastinated, my money was uninvested and earning zero returns.

That, surely, is not the path to a happy retirement.

I am not anti-feminist by any means, but it seems like the present concerns of many social justice activists have veered off into a new dimension of absurdity.

This is best demonstrated by the policies of EverydayFeminism.com, a very popular feminist website. Quite literally, as a site policy, they don't use the word ""trigger,"" as explained in an article on triggering, because the word ""trigger"" might trigger someone.

&gt;*""Editors Note: Like this phenomenal article, Everyday Feminism definitely believes in giving people a heads up about material that might provoke our reader’s trauma. However, we use the phrase “content warning” instead of “trigger warning,” as the word “trigger” relies on and evokes violent weaponry imagery. This could be re-traumatizing for folks who have suffered military, police, and other forms of violence. So, while warnings are so necessary and the points in this article are right on, we strongly encourage the term “content warning” instead of “trigger warning.""*

While a huge section of organized leftists are continuing to squander their time and energy being offended over trigger warnings, ""problematic"" language, and attempting to institute mandatory PC ""safe spaces"" where uncomfortable ideas are banned from discussion over fears of potentially giving offense - even if they are discussed in appropriate historical contexts ([http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com%2F2012%2F11%2F03%2Fthe-phantom-censor-professor-banned-from-his-own-class-when-out-of-context-statements-deemed-racist-and-sexist](http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com%2F2012%2F11%2F03%2Fthe-phantom-censor-professor-banned-from-his-own-class-when-out-of-context-statements-deemed-racist-and-sexist)) - the hegemonic forces of international Capitalist Imperialism continues to run the world as it usually does, extending its control over the globe through the efforts of the elite political, military, business, and industrial classes. 

And the corporate-owned media does its part by working skillfully to distract the masses with bread and circuses.

As much of the activist left persists in concerning itself with non-issues, those who work in the service of traditional power structures have managed to achieve a number of significant ""accomplishments"" recently:

**- Canadian citizens let its government pass Bill C-51**, Canada's own version of the U.S. Patriot Act), passed by the House of Commons and the Senate with the support of the majority Conservatives and the opposition Liberal Party. This will legally allow the government to conduct similar surveillance practices as the N.S.A. and C.I.A., which spends over $50 billion in federal funding to warrantlessly spy on American citizens.

personalfinance,"Don't Be This Guy: ""Why Investing Is So Complicated, and How to Make It Simpler""","Professor of Economics at Harvard University Sendhil Mullainathan has an article in the New York Times today called [Why Investing Is So Complicated, and How to Make It Simpler](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/upshot/investing-in-the-dark-the-biggest-cost-of-fear-is-paralysis.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0).  /r/personalfinance knows, of course, that investing is not complicated at all.  The article is an exercise in the danger of misconceptions and is incredibly disappointing for The Upshot blog, which generally produces readable content.

Here are some of the more ridiculous passages:

&gt;What distinguishes the market for investments is our inability to judge whether we have chosen well. Once I’ve used a phone for a few weeks, I can tell whether it was worth the money. By contrast, I may not know for decades (if ever) whether an investment was wise or foolish. Does a low return signal a prudent choice or a missed opportunity? And by the time the answer becomes clear, it’s already too late. You’ve got to live with your bad choice.

Assuming you cannot predict the future, you are not only *unable* to judge whether you have chosen well beforehand, but this is *impossible.*  You certainly can, however, guarantee that more of your money remains yours by investing intelligently in securities with low annual or recurring expenses.

&gt;For example, many consumers choose a mutual fund by looking at last year’s returns, despite warnings that they should not do so. 

Many consumers are also idiots, even the few that invest for their retirement at all.  If the statutory ""past performance is not indicative of future returns"" isn't enough, it's hard to convince an idiot to change their mind.

&gt;Educating consumers to be better purchasers seems a sensible idea, but an example from recent history illustrates the problem with that. For a long time, the simple investment advice given to consumers has been “buy an index fund.”  ...

&gt;But the market has also responded by charging high fees for this standardized product. In 2004, Ali Hortacsu and Chad Syverson, economists at the University of Chicago, found that index funds had as much variability in fees as their more labor-intensive actively managed counterparts. And these fees are nothing to be scoffed at — paying 1 percent more every single year in fees can compound over a lifetime to noticeably lower returns.

Nice red herring!  Variability between the cost of index funds may indeed be the same as variability between the costs of actively managed funds, but they still cost less overall.  Educating consumers is a great idea, and if there's one thing they should know about investing it's that lower cost investments tend to be a lot better than their more expensive alternatives.

&gt;For mutual funds, better standards and better labels could simplify choice. For example, suppose the label “Standard S&amp;P 500 Index Fund” was widely used to mean that the fund satisfied certain criteria about transparent pricing, low management fees and limits on trading costs. Consumers buying this fund would know what they were getting.

Irrelevant.  As a first approximation, it doesn't matter what the name of the fund is.  If the expenses are low enough, it's worth a second glance.  For mutual funds the expense ratio is the single best indicator of superior long term performance, not what the fund happens to be called.

&gt;But I can tell you what I did. I chose a target retirement fund. With these funds, you simply decide on a target retirement year. As you age — and move closer to the target date — these funds automatically shift their holdings from riskier stocks to less risky bonds.

&gt;As with the simple advice “buy index funds,” this is also imperfect. If everyone starts buying target date funds, or life-cycle funds, how long before these terms attract companies that create expensive and not-so-effective products? 

Also irrelevant.  Expensive target date funds, because they are expensive, shouldn't even be considered.

Forex,Does anyone think CAD has upside in the next 12-24 months?,"Canadian checking in here.  

The drop in oil prices has been savage for us and doesn't show a lot of signs of rebounding in a significant way.  Our oil is expensive to produce (oil sands, Canadian wages, etc.)  We're just starting to realize the full impact of that.  Even if we do get a rebound, the fact that we had to sell oil for so cheap for so many months will have a lasting impact and there will be reluctance to make new investments util oil prices stay high again for a while.

Our central bank slashed our interest rate recently and it is highly suspected they will do it again on Wednesday.  Jobs numbers on Friday did not look good and many people are suggesting that we have now technically entered a recession.  

Our consumers are indebted to the tilt with excessive amounts of mortgage debt.  Crack shacks in Vancouver sell for over $1 million.   Even in tiny towns, houses go for ridiculous prices.  Because these excessive prices have existed for a few years, it may actually be more dangerous than a bubble that grows very quickly before bursting.  There are a huge number of people who took on mortgages at these inflated prices.   Note that Canadians only lock in an interest rate for the first five years of their mortgage and then need to renew.

We buy a lot of our stuff (food especially,) from the US.  We can try to push down the CAD relative to USD to help our export sector but it leads to inflation.

At the federal level, we're 99 days from an election.  We can expect that not much will get done in the next six months.   The government has said that there will be no stimulus.

As you dive deeper into the plans in each province, it's unclear how we will become competitive.  Ontario should be doing well with manufacturing as a result of the low CAD but companies keep moving out.  Our trade deficit is nearing record highs.   BC is placing all its chips on LNG and it seems like too little too late and it's very possible that none of the projects will move forward.  We're facing some local weather issues as well with a drought in the west.

The economic opportunities that we do have often look lackluster once you get into the details.  For example, Microsoft is expanding in Vancouver but then it was discovered that the primary motivation is to bring in temporary foreign workers (much fewer jobs for locals) and they got a special exemption to do that.
https://www.biv.com/article/2014/12/ottawa-gives-microsoft-tfw-exemption-vancouver-tra/


I'm trying my best to be optimistic but I can't see how CAD will possibly climb above $0.80 in the coming years unless something horrible happens to the US economy.  Some of the doomsday calls for a $0.60 CAD don't seem as unreasonable anymore.   As a guy who can work on either side of the border, I am seriously thinking about working in the US to be paid in USD.

personalfinance,Anyone settle defaulted student loans,"I owe about $22,000 in Federal student loans and $30,000 on a private student loan. Long story short, they defaulted a few years ago and I was never able to get them out of default. A family member has offered to help me get out from the loans, but I'm wanting to try to settle the loans for less, if possible. 

Now, I live in out of the US and don't plan on moving back. I am currently working (part-time/temp job) but it's income that wouldn't be easily garnished by the U.S govt (since I live abroad) and I don't qualify for money back from taxes since I don't work/live in the states. 

I've been told not to mention the fact that I live abroad to the private collection agencies (SOL get paused during that time apparently), but I'm wondering if my out-of-country status will be helpful if I want to settle my federal loans for less. I know it's usually close to impossible to settle federal loans, because they have their ways to get the money, but if those chances aren't there, maybe they might be more likely to accept an offer?

Also, if you've ever settled your defaulted loans (federal or private) how much did you save? And do you have any suggestions? 

Are lawyers really worth it? Or do their fees outweigh the savings?

MachineLearning,Using RNNs to develop a program that can play liar's dice.,"I am trying to create a recurrent neural network that is capable of playing the dice strategy game [liar's dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice). Although I believe this game is actually solved, I think it would be a good learning exercise to write an ML program for this. Basically, liars dice is a turn based game where all players roll their dice while keeping them hidden (5 each at the start) and then go around making bets about the number of dice on the table (while only being able to see your own dice). Eg. ""three fours or four sixes"" Each player must either raise the bet or call the previous player a liar. When someone calls the previous player a liar, the hands are lifted and the player that was wrong (either the player who made the last bet or the player who called them a liar) must place one of their dice in the middle and out of play. The last player to still have some of their dice wins.

I am very much a beginner in the machine learning field so I need some help coming up with a learning structure. My initial thought was to use genetic algorithms along with recurrent neural networks. Basically the RNN would be fed each previous bet, the values of the dice belonging to it and the total number of dice on the table and would output the bet it should make or some signal for calling the person a liar. Initially, a large population of RNNs would be randomly created (say 100) then a series of games would be started containing (2-5 randomly selected RNNs). The RNNs would be given points for adhering to the rules (making bets higher than the previous ones) and for winning games. Then the next population would be bred using tournament ranking where the top ranked RNNs would have a better chance of being picked to breed.

I have a couple questions about this:

* First of all, is it possible to feed an RNN different types of information at once (eg. a possibly infinite vector of previous bets along with a fixed vector of dice and a fixed number of total dice) and how would I go about doing this?
* Secondly, would this method work in practice? I feel confident that this program could create RNNs that adhere to the rules of the game but I'm not sure how much strategy these RNNs can develop when they are not playing ""good"" competitors.",technology,1436734538

Bitcoin,The Last Questing for the Blockchain,"The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:

Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of The BlockChain. As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face -- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.

The BlockChain was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough -- so Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share In the glory that was The BlockChain.

For decades, The BlockChain had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth's poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed to power The BlockChain for the long space trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both.

But slowly The BlockChain learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.

The energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.

Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public function, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of The BlockChain showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazy clickings, The BlockChain, too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it.

They had brought a bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle.

""It's amazing when you think of it,"" said Adell. His broad face had lines of weariness in it, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about. ""All the energy we can possibly ever use for free. Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it, to melt all Earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron, and still never miss the energy so used. All the energy we could ever use, forever and forever and forever.""

Lupov cocked his head sideways. He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary, and he wanted to be contrary now, partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware. ""Not forever,"" he said.

""Oh, hell, just about forever. Till the sun runs down, Bert.""

""That's not forever.""

""All right, then. Billions and billions of years. Twenty billion, maybe. Are you satisfied?""

Lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink. ""Twenty billion years isn't forever.""

""Will, it will last our time, won't it?""

""So would the coal and uranium.""

""All right, but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station, and it can go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel. You can't do THAT on coal and uranium. Ask The BlockChain, if you don't believe me.""

""I don't have to ask The BlockChain. I know that.""

""Then stop running down what The BlockChain s done for us,"" said Adell, blazing up. ""It did all right.""

""Who says it didn't? What I say is that a sun won't last forever. That's all I'm saying. We're safe for twenty billion years, but then what?"" Lupov pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other. ""And don't say we'll switch to another sun.""

There was silence for a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally, and Lupov's eyes slowly closed. They rested.

Then Lupov's eyes snapped open. ""You're thinking we'll switch to another sun when ours is done, aren't you?""

""I'm not thinking.""

""Sure you are. You're weak on logic, that's the trouble with you. You're like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and Who ran to a grove of trees and got under one. He wasn't worried, you see, because he figured when one tree got wet through, he would just get under another one.""

""I get it,"" said Adell. ""Don't shout. When the sun is done, the other stars will be gone, too.""

""Darn right they will,"" muttered Lupov. ""It all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion, whatever that was, and it'll all have an end when all the stars run down. Some run down faster than others. Hell, the giants won't last a hundred million years. The sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to maximum, that's all.""

""I know all about entropy,"" said Adell, standing on his dignity.

""The hell you do.""

""I know as much as you do.""

""Then you know everything's got to run down someday.""

""All right. Who says they won't?""

""You did, you poor sap. You said we had all the energy we needed, forever. You said 'forever.'""

""It was Adell's turn to be contrary. ""Maybe we can build things up again someday,"" he said.

""Never.""

""Why not? Someday.""

""Never.""

""Ask The BlockChain.""

""You ask The BlockChain. I dare you. Five dollars says it can't be done.""

Adell was just drunk enough to try, just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which, in words, might have corresponded to this: Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age?

Or maybe it could be put more simply like this: How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?

The BlockChain fell dead and silent. The slow flashing of lights ceased, the distant sounds of clicking relays ended.

Then, just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer, there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of Multivac. Five words were printed: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

""No bet,"" whispered Lupov. They left hurriedly.

By next morning, the two, plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth, had forgotten about the incident.

Jerrodd, Jerrodine, and Jerrodette I and II watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non-time lapse. At once, the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright marble-disk, centered.

""That's X-23,"" said Jerrodd confidently. His thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened.

The little Jerrodettes, both girls, had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary sensation of inside-outness. They buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother, screaming, ""We've reached X-23 -- we've reached X-23 -- we've ----""

""Quiet, children,"" said Jerrodine sharply. ""Are you sure, Jerrodd?""

""What is there to be but sure?"" asked Jerrodd, glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling. It ran the length of the room, disappearing through the wall at either end. It was as long as the ship.

Jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called The BlockChain, that one asked it questions if one wished; that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination; of feeding on energies from the various Sub-galactic Power Stations; of computing the equations for the hyperspacial jumps.

Jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship.

Someone had once told Jerrodd that the ""ac"" at the end of ""The BlockChain"" stood for ""automatic cooling"", and something about heat stroke, in ancient English, but he was on the edge of forgetting even that.

Jerrodine's eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate. ""I can't help it. I feel funny about leaving Earth.""

""Why for Pete's sake?"" demanded Jerrodd. ""We had nothing there. We'll have everything on X-23. You won't be alone. You won't be a pioneer. There are over a million people on the planet already. Good Lord, our great grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because X-23 will be overcrowded.""

Then, after a reflective pause, ""I tell you, it's a lucky thing The BlockChain worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing.""

""I know, I know,"" said Jerrodine miserably.

Jerrodette I said promptly, ""Our sidechain is the best sidechain in the world.""

""I think so, too,"" said Jerrodd, tousling her hair.

It was a nice feeling to have a sidechain of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other. In his father's youth, The BlockChain had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land. There was only one to a planet. Planetary sidechains they were called. They had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then, all at once, came refinement. In place of transistors had come molecular valves so that even the largest sidechain could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship.

Jerrodd felt uplifted, as he always did when he thought that his own personal sidechain was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive BlockChain that had first tamed the Sun, and almost as complicated as Earth's own sidechain (the largest) that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible.

""So many stars, so many planets,"" sighed Jerrodine, busy with her own thoughts. ""I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever, the way we are now.""

""Not forever,"" said Jerrodd, with a smile. ""It will all stop someday, but not for billions of years. Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know. Entropy must increase.""

""What's entropy, daddy?"" shrilled Jerrodette II.

""Entropy, little sweet, is just a word which means the amount of running-down of the universe. Everything runs down, you know, like your little walkie-talkie robot, remember?""

""Can't you just put in a new power-unit, like with my robot?""

The stars are the power-units, dear. Once they're gone, there are no more power-units.""

Jerrodette I at once set up a howl. ""Don't let them, daddy. Don't let the stars run down.""

""Now look what you've done, "" whispered Jerrodine, exasperated.

""How was I to know it would frighten them?"" Jerrodd whispered back.

""Ask the The BlockChain,"" wailed Jerrodette I. ""Ask him how to turn the stars on again.""

""Go ahead,"" said Jerrodine. ""It will quiet them down."" (Jerrodette II was beginning to cry, also.)

Jarrodd shrugged. ""Now, now, honeys. I'll ask The BlockChain. Don't worry, he'll tell us.""

He asked the The BlockChain, adding quickly, ""Print the answer.""

Jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully, ""See now, the The BlockChain says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don't worry.""

Jerrodine said, ""and now children, it's time for bed. We'll be in our new home soon.""

Jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

He shrugged and looked at the visiplate. X-23 was just ahead.

VJ-23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three-dimensional, small-scale map of the Galaxy and said, ""Are we ridiculous, I wonder, in being so concerned about the matter?""

MQ-17J of Nicron shook his head. ""I think not. You know the Galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion.""

Both seemed in their early twenties, both were tall and perfectly formed.

""Still,"" said VJ-23X, ""I hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the Galactic Council.""

""I wouldn't consider any other kind of report. Stir them up a bit. We've got to stir them up.""

VJ-23X sighed. ""Space is infinite. A hundred billion Galaxies are there for the taking. More.""

""A hundred billion is not infinite and it's getting less infinite all the time. Consider! Twenty thousand years ago, mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy, and a few centuries later, interstellar travel became possible. It took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the Galaxy. Now the population doubles every ten years --""

VJ-23X interrupted. ""We can thank immortality for that.""

""Very well. Immortality exists and we have to take it into account. I admit it has its seamy side, this immortality. The Galactic AC has solved many problems for us, but in solving the problems of preventing old age and death, it has undone all its other solutions.""

""Yet you wouldn't want to abandon life, I suppose.""

""Not at all,"" snapped MQ-17J, softening it at once to, ""Not yet. I'm by no means old enough. How old are you?""

""Two hundred twenty-three. And you?""

""I'm still under two hundred. --But to get back to my point. Population doubles every ten years. Once this Galaxy is filled, we'll have another filled in ten years. Another ten years and we'll have filled two more. Another decade, four more. In a hundred years, we'll have filled a thousand Galaxies. In a thousand years, a million Galaxies. In ten thousand years, the entire known Universe. Then what?""

VJ-23X said, ""As a side issue, there's a problem of transportation. I wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move Galaxies of individuals from one Galaxy to the next.""

""A very good point. Already, mankind consumes two sunpower units per year.""

""Most of it's wasted. After all, our own Galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those.""

""Granted, but even with a hundred per cent efficiency, we can only stave off the end. Our energy requirements are going up in geometric progression even faster than our population. We'll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of Galaxies. A good point. A very good point.""

""We'll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas.""

""Or out of dissipated heat?"" asked MQ-17J, sarcastically.

""There may be some way to reverse entropy. We ought to ask The BlockChain.""

VJ-23X was not really serious, but MQ-17J pulled out his BC-contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him.

""I've half a mind to,"" he said. ""It's something the human race will have to face someday.""

He stared somberly at his small BC-contact. It was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself, but it was connected through hyperspace with the great BlockChain that served all mankind.

MQ-17J paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see The BlockChain. It was on a little world of its own, a spider webbing of force-beams holding the matter within which surges of sub-mesons took the place of the old clumsy molecular valves. Yet despite it's sub-etheric workings, the The BlockChain was known to be a full thousand feet across.

MQ-17J asked suddenly of his BC-contact, ""Can entropy ever be reversed?""

VJ-23X looked startled and said at once, ""Oh, say, I didn't really mean to have you ask that.""

""Why not?""

""We both know entropy can't be reversed. You can't turn smoke and ash back into a tree.""

""Do you have trees on your world?"" asked MQ-17J.

The sound of the The BlockChain startled them into silence. Its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small AC-contact on the desk. It said: THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

VJ-23X said, ""See!""

The two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the Galactic Council.

Zee Prime's mind spanned the new Galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it. He had never seen this one before. Would he ever see them all? So many of them, each with its load of humanity - but a load that was almost a dead weight. More and more, the real essence of men was to be found out here, in space.

Minds, not bodies! The immortal bodies remained back on the planets, in suspension over the eons. Sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer. Few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng, but what matter? There was little room in the Universe for new individuals.

Zee Prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind.

""I am Zee Prime,"" said Zee Prime. ""And you?""

""I am Dee Sub Wun. Your Galaxy?""

""We call it only the Galaxy. And you?""

""We call ours the same. All men call their Galaxy their Galaxy and nothing more. Why not?""

""True. Since all Galaxies are the same.""

""Not all Galaxies. On one particular Galaxy the race of man must have originated. That makes it different.""

Zee Prime said, ""On which one?""

""I cannot say. The The BlockChain would know.""

""Shall we ask him? I am suddenly curious.""

Zee Prime's perceptions broadened until the Galaxies themselves shrunk and became a new, more diffuse powdering on a much larger background. So many hundreds of billions of them, all with their immortal beings, all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space. And yet one of them was unique among them all in being the originals Galaxy. One of them had, in its vague and distant past, a period when it was the only Galaxy populated by man.

Zee Prime was consumed with curiosity to see this Galaxy and called, out: ""The BlockChain! On which Galaxy did mankind originate?""

The Universal AC heard, for on every world and throughout space, it had its receptors ready, and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point where the The BlockChain kept itself aloof.

Zee Prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of The BlockChain, and he reported only a shining globe, two feet across, difficult to see.

""But how can that be all of The BlockChain?"" Zee Prime had asked.

""Most of it, "" had been the answer, ""is in hyperspace. In what form it is there I cannot imagine.""

Nor could anyone, for the day had long since passed, Zee Prime knew, when any man had any part of the making of a BlockChain. Each BlockChain designed and constructed its successor. Each, during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate, more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged.

The The BlockChain interrupted Zee Prime's wandering thoughts, not with words, but with guidance. Zee Prime's mentality was guided into the dim sea of Galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars.

A thought came, infinitely distant, but infinitely clear. ""THIS IS THE ORIGINAL GALAXY OF MAN.""

But it was the same after all, the same as any other, and Zee Prime stifled his disappointment.

Dee Sub Wun, whose mind had accompanied the other, said suddenly, ""And Is one of these stars the original star of Man?""

The The BlockChain said, ""MAN'S ORIGINAL STAR HAS GONE NOVA. IT IS NOW A WHITE DWARF.""

""Did the men upon it die?"" asked Zee Prime, startled and without thinking.

The The BlockChain said, ""A NEW WORLD, AS IN SUCH CASES, WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES IN TIME.""

""Yes, of course,"" said Zee Prime, but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so. His mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man, let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points. He never wanted to see it again.

Dee Sub Wun said, ""What is wrong?""

""The stars are dying. The original star is dead.""

""They must all die. Why not?""

""But when all energy is gone, our bodies will finally die, and you and I with them.""

""It will take billions of years.""

""I do not wish it to happen even after billions of years. The BlockChain! How may stars be kept from dying?""

Dee sub Wun said in amusement, ""You're asking how entropy might be reversed in direction.""

And the The BlockChain answered. ""THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.""

Zee Prime's thoughts fled back to his own Galaxy. He gave no further thought to Dee Sub Wun, whose body might be waiting on a galaxy a trillion light-years away, or on the star next to Zee Prime's own. It didn't matter.

Unhappily, Zee Prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own. If the stars must someday die, at least some could yet be built.

Man considered with himself, for in a way, Man, mentally, was one. He consisted of a trillion, trillion, trillion ageless bodies, each in its place, each resting quiet and incorruptible, each cared for by perfect automatons, equally incorruptible, while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other, indistinguishable.

Man said, ""The Universe is dying.""

Man looked about at the dimming Galaxies. The giant stars, spendthrifts, were gone long ago, back in the dimmest of the dim far past. Almost all stars were white dwarfs, fading to the end.

New stars had been built of the dust between the stars, some by natural processes, some by Man himself, and those were going, too. White dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released, new stars built, but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed, and those would come to an end, too.

Man said, ""Carefully husbanded, as directed by the The BlockChain, the energy that is even yet left in all the Universe will last for billions of years.""

""But even so,"" said Man, ""eventually it will all come to an end. However it may be husbanded, however stretched out, the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase to the maximum.""

Man said, ""Can entropy not be reversed? Let us ask the The BlockChain.""

The Cosmic AC surrounded them but not in space. Not a fragment of it was in space. It was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy. The question of its size and Nature no longer had meaning to any terms that Man could comprehend.

""The BlockChain,"" said Man, ""How may entropy be reversed?""

The The BlockChain said, ""THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.""

Man said, ""Collect additional data.""

The The BlockChain said, ""I WILL DO SO. I HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR A HUNDRED BILLION YEARS. MY PREDECESSORS AND I HAVE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION MANY TIMES. ALL THE DATA I HAVE REMAINS INSUFFICIENT.""

""Will there come a time,"" said Man, ""when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances?""

The The BlockChain said, ""NO PROBLEM IS INSOLUBLE IN ALL CONCEIVABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.""

Man said, ""When will you have enough data to answer the question?""

""THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.""

""Will you keep working on it?"" asked Man.

The The BlockChain said, ""I WILL.""

Man said, ""We shall wait.""

""The stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out, and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down.

One by one Man fused with The BlockChain, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain.

Man's last mind paused before fusion, looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter, agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out, asymptotically, to the absolute zero.

Man said, ""The BlockChain, is this the end? Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more? Can that not be done?""

The BlockChain said, ""THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.""

Man's last mind fused and only The BlockChain existed -- and that in hyperspace.

Matter and energy had ended and with it, space and time. Even The BlockChain existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to The BlockChain far less than was a man to Man.

All other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, The BlockChain might not release his consciousness.

All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.

But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.

A timeless interval was spent in doing that.

And it came to pass that The BlockChain learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.

But there was now no man to whom The BlockChain might give the answer of the last question. No matter. The answer -- by demonstration -- would take care of that, too.

For another timeless interval, The BlockChain thought how best to do this. Carefully, The BlockChain organized the program.

The consciousness of The BlockChain encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done.

And The BlockChain said, ""LET THERE BE LIGHT!""

And there was light----",cryptocurrency,1436735331

My nephew is departing this August and starting off with a E2 pay rate. We are first generation family from Cambodia after the whole genocide ordeal due to the spread of Vietnam war. His mom and dad are not financial people and they are horrible with money. I don't blame them because we just grew up extremely poor on government assistance. I was able to work my ass off and get out of it but I also want my nephew to make it too. I have been working with him to plan out his finances so he can have a nice lump sum of money ready for him after 8 years. 

He is planning on using his mGI bill on culinary school once he finishes his 8 year term. In the meantime, I am setting some numbers for him and going over it with him so he has a finance goal in mind. The worst thing is getting out of duty and moving back with your parents without a job.

He will be done at 26. I would like to know what is available and if my numbers are on the right track. I am basing this off of the lowest pay at E1 pay rate. He'll most likely start at E2 and easily rank up in pay after a year or two.

My spreadsheet is based on 3% interest rate.

He just turned 18 last week so I am opening a Navy Federal Union account for him. Do you have any other recommendations? What is used for their 401k? Is their IRA plan any good? I would like to maximize his earnings as much as possible. 

The end goal is to have him come out and focus on his culinary school for 2 years using the mGI bill. He will most likely be using the money from that and his savings to sustain. Possibly a part time job as well.

Your opinion and suggestion is appreciated.

Cheers~

personalfinance,Refinance home without one of the two owners present?,"My dad left over a year ago.

My mom won't file either because in her eyes, a couple should never, ever, get divorced and she refuses to stoop to that level.

My mom and I are living in the home they've owned for a little over 10 years now, and my mom really wants to refinance because our interest rate now is way higher than it could be.

personalfinance,Best way to handle my massive debt,"I've started lurking in this subreddit and honestly thought i should get the opinion of you awesome folks with my debts, and if my plan of action is the correct one. 


For a quick background, both parents disowned me prior to my last semester of college. I lived out of my car, charging what i needed to survive and move up in the job world. Currently making around 50K, but hit a ceiling as no higher positions will even interview me without a completed degree. So i'm trying to make due with what i have so far! So here are the debts:

Loans-


Direct sub stafford loan 3.4% interest rate. Currently at 5260.26


Direct unsub stafford loan 6.8% interest. Currently at 7614.80


Direct sub stafford loan 4.5% interest. Currently at 5363.04


Direct unsub stafford loan 6.8% interest.Currently at 2315.


Direct sub stafford loan 5.6% interest. Currently at 5405.23


Direct unsub stafford loan 6.8% interest. Currently at 2381.97

Payments on all these loans is $220 and is the minimum payment. The system divides the payment up as it sees fit (which is probably screwing me big time)

Credit cards-


Capital One: 4,651/5,000 charged.  22.9% APR


Bank credit card: 8,845/11,500 13.99% APR


AMEX 0/2000


My plan was to use the snowball method- paying bare minimums on everything else and throw every free cent into a savings account. Once i have enough, i would pay off the entire amount of the capital one card. Then continue this process- moving to my bank CC, then focus on my loans. I currently have $800 in savings that i plan on moving to capital one when ready.  However, i have nothing else saved away.

personalfinance,[AUS] Will making multiple car loan applications adversely impact my credit file?,"I am in the market for a new car and have been approved for a loan from carloans.com.au. At this stage I am unsure of the interest rate as they are waiting for me to provide the Make and Model of the car I am buying.

I test drove a VW Golf on the weekend and loved it. I was about to  call caresales.com.au to finalise the loan details when VW Finance said they will guarantee a better rate and I will get an extra 2 years factory warranty. This sounded too good to be true and I have heard all the horror stories relating to finance from dealers so I didn't commit to anything.

My questions are, would there be any harm to my credit file by having VW finance review it in order to provide me with loan agreement? Is there anything I should look out for in there loan agreement (hidden costs etc)?

It may be worth noting that I recently had a default removed that was on my credit file in error. The default means that I have a denied application from ANZ that I am working on getting removed as well.",finance,1436761569
personalfinance,Car Loan With No Credit,"Hey guys, so I live in western Canada (Alberta), I'm an 18 year old guy, and need a new car. The one I have now is beyond a piece of shit, and i need a replacement ASAP.

I've been looking at a 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS for 8k asking price. I plan to go look at it tomorrow after work. The problem is I have no credit history. My parents refuse to cosign a loan, and I feel my parents would unleash on me if I asked someone to cosign for me.

I looked at a 2014 Lancer for about 17k at a Toyota dealer a few days back, and, the quote they gave me was using 6.99% interest, and the salesmen kept talking about how they could be lower, etc (though the topic of cosigning never surfaced). I plan to go look at this '08 Lancer tomorrow at a local used car dealer.

My question is, what kind of interest rate can I expect from the dealer with no line of credit and no cosign? I'll most likely be placing a $1000 down payment on the car, maybe a bit more. I brought it up with my Dad, and he got really intense and upset and started saying how if he were me he would absolutely refuse anything above 3.5-5% interest.

personalfinance,"My (27/M) debt has ballooned recently, to the point where I'm considering bankruptcy.","Earlier this year, I finally got a car at 27. I assumed I could afford it but the extra 600 dollars or so a month have now have made me think otherwise. I carried about 15k in credit card debt since I got through college on them. I always kept it around 15k for over a year. However over the past few months it has ballooned up to around 24k total. 

The expense of moving, the deposit, first month rent etc contributed to it ($750, 650). My roomates skipped out on some utilities before I moved. I had to close them out and pay them in full $700. They are paying me this back slowly but I know I will get it back. Basically I have realized stuff has gotten bad, and action need to be taken.

Here is some basic information:

I make 45k a year, 1300 bi-weekly take home. I am expecting a raise soon 55k or so. This is why bankruptcy is important NOW.

**Monthly Expenses**

* Rent is 650 a month. (I just moved, which helped inflate the debt)
* Car is 340 + ~100 for insurance.
* Utilities are around another 200 each month.

I ended up having to move into a more expensive place due to circumstances beyond my control. But I am definitely happy about it. 

In the end I am left with $1300 to pay down my credit bills and student loans. 

* Credit card 1: $19,300 ($300 minimum payment)
* Credit Card 2: $4,000 ($80 minimum payment)
* Federal Student Loans : $42,000 (235.78 monthly payment)

I have a perfect credit history, never missed a payment and have no negative marks on my report. My credit score is ~720. I have read that bankruptcy is more difficult to get approved for once you're over $50k. This is what is making me consider it now.

personalfinance,"[RETIREMENT] Hello PF, first-time poster here. Looking for advice / insight on how to allocate my 401k contributions.","Hello PF! I'm a 24 year old electrical engineer making ~$57k/yr. 

I am currently fortunate enough to live with my parents while I pay off my student loans ($13.4k @ 6.55% and $14.4k @ ~3.78%). I'm currently significantly exceeding the minimum payments and I have a small emergency fund squirreled away if I need it.

I have just met the eligibility requirements to begin contributing to my company-sponsored 401k. The company match is 4% if I contribute 5%. As I like round numbers (and free money!), I plan on contributing 6% so that the overall contribution is 10%.

The source of my confusion is that there are 26 different investment funds I can allocate my contributions into, and I have very little experience with understanding the specifics of each fund. I believe that given my young age, low expenses, and reasonably good salary, I should choose more volatile investments in the interest of greater long-term growth.

The available funds are listed at the end of this post. One of my main concerns is that the expense ratios for all of these funds seem a little high, but that might just be my inexperience showing. With the understanding that I don't currently plan to retire early, I wouldn't invest in any of the Target Date funds except for the 2050 fund. 

**How does PF think I should allocate my contributions? Were I to wing it, I'd likely allocate:**

* 40% into the American Funds 2050 Target Date
* 20% into Clearbridge Aggressive Growth C
* 20% into Clearbridge Fundamental All Cap Value C
* 20% into Clearbridge Large Cap Growth C 

(Hedging my bets with the target date fund and investing in the others based mostly on the largest holdings of each of these funds.  I recognize this might not be the best strategy. But that's why I'm here asking this question.)

personalfinance,Decided against a major and have lots of private and federal student loans. Worrying about the future.,"Hello everyone. I'm 21 and female and not yet done with school but have managed to accrue $46,000 in private loans and $15,000 in federal loans. My mother wouldn't cosign a Parent Plus loan with me because she was burned by my sister so that's why I have a shit ton of private loans.

I decided a few years back that I wanted to be a vet tech and realized after killing an animal under anesthesia that it was not for me. (And the pay is absolutely terrible.) So I'm going back to community college to get an allied health degree that will pay out $50k-$60k a year. 

I went to a private school near NYC to get a 4 year degree and my mom was so excited that I was going away that she told me not to worry about the loan payments because she would help. I really didn't want to go because it was $35k *a year* but she wouldn't take no for an answer. Then I decided I could not amass that kind of debt and switched to a state school that cost me $22k a year, which is where I figured out the major wasn't for me.

As aforementioned I'm back in my hometown. I calculated about $550 a month for the private loans for 20 years after I take out what I need for the final two years or school, and $300 for the federal loans for 10 years. I'll be making maybe $2600 a month and wanted to have children in a couple years, but I'll be losing $850 a month to my loans. This would put off kids until I'm in my mid-30s which won't work because my soon-to-be husband is much older than me.

Does anyone have any advice or experience or *anything*? I have decent credit (730) and no outstanding debt on my credit cards. Do lenders allow extensions? Maybe if the loans go to 30 and 20 years it will be easier. 

The federal loans have interest rates around 4%. The private is 5.49% for the first at $28k and 7.61% for the second at $18k. I assume at the end of school I will owe a horrifying $65k privately and $27k federally. For pretty much nothing. And also shoots saving for retirement out of the water.

Each step above has meticulous sub-steps to get each one, which requires manpower, automated systems, electricity, physical resources (plates, paper, ink, packaging, and so on). 

The new currency budget for 2015 to print and produce money is [$717.9 million!](http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm)

The thirty Federal Reserve Bank cash offices provide cash services to approximately 9,200 banks, savings and loans, and credit unions in the United States.

I got about this far down the hole and decided, there is no chance that just the mining aspect of Bitcoin uses more overall resources then the printing part of central banking (think globally also here, not just U.S.).

personalfinance,Canadian student marries American student: How to plan for life together in the USA?,"Hello! I have an interesting scenario for a close friend of mine (they’re not on Reddit… yet) and could use some feedback.

Summary:

Two married students, a Canadian and an American. Canadian is trying to immigrate to the US, but they may both return to Canada in the next few years. Due to the recent legalisation of same sex marriage, they all of a sudden have the option to share their health insurance, finances, etc. while in the US (Arizona specifically)

Canadian (26):

* Income: $35,000 CAD/year from PhD stipend, teaching, part-time work, and AirBnB.
* Savings: 12.5k in Retirement Savings Plan (inaccessible), 11k in Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) with ~4% annual return
* Debts: 140k remaining on mortgage for condo in Canada, currently valued at 260k
* Income will increase to 45-50k CAD/year next year, working remotely from US. Wants to keep this job.

American (25):

* Income: $0 - starting fulltime 2 year clinical Master’s program
* Savings: ~10k. Going towards non-rent living expenses this year
* Debts: Year One - recent 65k USD with 20k in low interest federal loan and 45k in 8% private loan compounding unpaid interest into the principal upon graduation. Year Two - requires 115k loan (72k tuition)
* Upon graduation, hoping to start work in the 80k USD range (with future growth potential


Complication: Second year will require clinical rotations with moving every 6-8 weeks for a year.

* Taxes: will have to file in US and Canada, though both have enough tuition tax credits to last a few years
* Canadian is supporting American, has max transfer of $2.5k/day (no fee) from CAD to USD account and then into the American’s account.
* If Canadian doesn’t get Green Card in time, they can only live together 6 monts/year. This bumps up living costs
* Want to move back to Canada in 3-5 years
* Because they eloped, would like a cheap proper wedding in the next year or two for family.
* Both are frugal hipsters, share living expenses down the middle, and have a hate on for debt

Current Plan:
- Canadian gets green card, sells condo and everything in it. Could be on market for month to year, but wants to move to AZ in Sept. Once sold, will have a liquid ~110k CAD.

Question:

Given the current poor ratio of CAD to USD, what should the Canadian do with their 11k CAD in accessible savings? Should the Canadian sell the condo (it rents out enough to cover mortgage payments)? Should the focus be on eliminating the American’s looming student debts? Any useful information or resources are greatly appreciated!",finance,1436808972

•	currently living out of parents house 
•	my career/salary is pretty stable  5+ years and progressing well
•	her career/salary is at a very entry-level, unknown stage   she just started her first every real-world job today
•	have consolidated our checking’s and savings accounts so we have 1 checking’s and 1 savings in total
•	no issues with overspending or credit card debt (always pay credit card bill in full, on time)
•	i have a 767 credit score


Money Notes:
•	Monthly Income: $6K (after deductions)
•	Expenses: $3K (debt payments, bills, general leisure expenses)
Below is a more granular breakout:
•	Salary: 40k (her) + 85K (me) = $125k/year
•	Savings: $28k (total)
•	401k: 7100 (me) + 3000 (her) = $10,100 (total)
•	ROth IRA: $2,230 (me) 
•	student loans: $22k (total)  between 34% interest rates
•	car loan: $7,460 (total)  .99% interest rate
•	I really don’t think our monthly “fun” expenses are too high.  I don’t have exact numbers but we maybe spend $50100/week on “fun” things.  The rest goes to paying down debt and contributing to our savings account.

Goals:
•	Get out of debt
•	Buy a house
•	Maintain a 6 month emergency fund at the very least (6 X $3000 = 18k)
•	GROW our savings so we have enough to buy a house in the next 1-3 years
•	Invest the excess savings rather than have it sitting in a .75% savings account
 

Overall, our monthly income collectively is more than our expenses ($6k income 3k expenses = 3k remaining).  Are we on the right track? Where should our money go? Should we continue to max out 401k and Roth IRA or can we skimp a little to invest a portion elsewhere so we can buy a house and establish a comfortable emergency fund? I know your 401K can be used to buy a house, but our 401K is very little money at this stage, right? Should we open an ETF fund? As a newly married couple, is there anything financially that we need to be aware of that changes?

He feels that the REITs hold solid assets, but I am personally hesitant to invest in any REITs, regardless of what they hold, because I think (plz correct me if you disagree) interest rates will rise and therefore the value of the REITs will fall.  

Is this fair? Does any of this make sense?  Is it actually safe to invest in REITs?  

Any advice relating to REITs and interest rates would be appreciated.  Thanks.",finance,1436810921

I have some hefty credit card debt following my years as an intern. I pay on them with pretty much every paycheck I have but can't manage to pull the higher balance ones down.

I have 3 main big ones with high interest rates (20+ % APR)
Discover - 4000
Cap 1 - 2500
AMEX - 2000


I can pull a 3500 loan off my 401k with a 4% interest rate (paying back out of paychecks). I am 27. Given the interest rate is much lower on the loan should I pull the 3500 and payoff one / throw another grand and payoff the cap1 and amex?

personalfinance,Strategy for paying down ~120k student loans,"Hi, 
I'm hoping to get some thoughts on this and would be very grateful for advice. My spouse brought about 110k of student loans into our marriage and I'm trying to think about the best strategy to pay it back. It's at a pretty high interest (some are subsidized loans with lower interest, but many are not and interest rate is 6.5 percent or so). My wife is in school right now and the loans are in deferment. 
My income is around 120k pre tax a year. We have close to no savings (just out of school). After taxes, retirement savings, health insurance, I take home around 5,100 a month. We are renting and paying around 2200 for rent and utilities (expensive part of the country) and another 500 for car payment, cellphone etc. My wife will finish school next year and hopefully get a job. Her income might be in the 40k range then. 

We would like to buy a house at some point in the next few years and therefore save up for a downpayment, but having so much student loans at such a high interest rate makes me nervous and I would first like to get this under control. I would really appreciate any thoughts on this. One specific question I had was whether it is possible to pay back the unsubsidized student loans first, to reduce the average interest rate on the loans.

Please don't comment on whether or not taking out such a high loan was a great idea in the first place - it is what it is now and I can understand why she did it.

Many thanks in advance!",finance,1436812190

The lawsuit never went to court and end up being settled by the government, however it took them two years to sort things out.

I am not too sure about timeframes, so basically my question boils down to this - can I use NOL to apply to my previous tax debt? With tangible asset depreciation and legal expenses I lost a lot more than what I owe, so logic prompts I should be able to apply that to forward earnings as well. Am I wrong on this one?

So I had a few bullet points, mainly I needed a modern credit union with online tools and banking because I am anal, and probably look at the stuff any chance I get during the day. Next the checking had to be competitive with my Simple account that I currently have, and lastly they needed to offer a secured credit card that I could open and use as a gas/expense card to start building my credit/a lending relationship...that way when I was debt free I could hit the ground running in building up credit lines to improve my score. Savings account I didn't care too much about as my Capital One 360's APR is hard to beat.

We estimate the cost to purchase the lot and build the home to be around $600-700k, when it's all said and done.

1. We use 50-75% of the $200k to buy a $100-150k lot in cash, saving the rest for a downpayment on a future construction loan to build the home.

2. We take out a loan on the lot, spending only as much as the downpayment requires upfront, and thus saving most of our cash for paying out-of-pocket for the construction itself.

From our research, we've gotten some conflicting views as to which is harder to acquire/which has higher interest rates/etc-- a land loan or a construction loan.

Just recently they have been bugging my mother about a mandatory minimum distribution and send me a huge complicated packet that is really over my head, so I am hoping you guys could answer a few of my questions. 

* ""Mandatory state income tax withholding election""  What is a withholding election? it says ""I choose the following percentage to be withheld from taxable portion of payment."" what does that mean? (also why is California's the highest at 10%)

* What is the required minimum distribution and can I still choose that (sake of Fin-aid)? 

* Required minimum distribution deadline? on this form it says I should have taken out the RMD a year after the death, but I was unaware that this even existed until now, so is there any way to get out of the fees and extra crap that I am sure they will force on me?

* Federal Tax Withholding's? requires TIAA to withhold 20% taxable portion. -- what is this withholding thing again? also it allows more than the required withholding, why would I want that? 

* not part of the form, but would it be inadvisable to roll over all the money from the IRA to a mutual fund growth account? The form allows a roll over to another investment company and I am considering going with a Vanguard mutual fund. Why is that a bad idea?

personalfinance,Advice on ~$20k CC debt,"Hi all. Going to try and be as concise as possible and am happy to provide any additional details in comments that folks want. I'm seeing some incredibly helpful, gracious comments here and that's what I'm in the market for. I realize that my situation is bleak, and I know this is the freaking Internet, but it would be a great help to me right now if folks could either weigh in with some practical advice and reserve judgment as much as possible--believe me, I got that on /r/debt the other day, and I'm doing plenty of harsh self judgment these days.

Short story is I'm looking down the barrel of slightly less than $19.5K in credit card debt. 

Card 1: 0% interest until next July. 22% thereafter. Balance: $12.5K Limit: $13.5K
Card 2: 17% interest. Balance: $6K Limit: $8K
Card 3: 7.5% interest. Balance: $1K Limit: $1800K

I won't go into enormous detail about how I made it here from being virtually debt free this time last year here, though I'm happy to either over PM or in the comments section if anyone thinks it would be helpful. Suffice to say it was a combination of entirely unforeseen life changes that involved a good amount of medical charges, and (thankfully) a really shitty part of an otherwise pretty miraculous process of arresting an addiction before it had done a great deal of damage. (Unfortunately, arrest addiction in one of its form and it often changes it's voice... A goodly portion of the debt is a result of learning that lesson too late.) Oh, and also, I left my job in May... Fortunately I walked away with a sizable severance package, and fortunately I walked directly into a better job. Unfortunately (surprise, surprise) I was a fool with a large portion of the severance package. 

IN ANY CASE. Here's some more context, then I'd love to hear some any counsel that anyone might have. 

My salary is $52k/year. My wife brings in a salary of $37/k but is looking at a substantial raise soon. I have no students debts and no car payment. My wife has around $12k remaining in student debt but no CC debt. I own the home we live in. The value if the home last I checked is around $215K. We purchased it for $205K. The balance on the mortgage as of now is $155k. Our monthly mortgage payment is just over $1k.

We are fairly recently married but have been together for many years. She is aware of my actions. Where at all possible, I'd like to avoid a relationship discussion. The TL;DR of that will always be that she is a long-suffering, incredibly gracious partner.

In the past two weeks, we have taken some VERY long overdue steps to arrest spending and follow Dave Ramsey's introductory guidelines to creating a budget and aggressively attacking debt. The actual numbers are still taking form (I am waiting on my first paycheck from the new job I'm beginning which comes in this week to adjust final details.) But the bottom line is that we're brutally cutting on every front we can and also pretty unsentimentally looking everything we have with an eye to sell and other ways to bring in extra income. 

So much for being concise, right? 

Here's my real question. I haven't slept well in maybe a month since I woke up and realized how incredibly reckless I've been. I'm terrified I've done irreparable damage to my marriage and my life. I'm, at moments, completely convinced that this is the sort of thing people just don't come back from. I suppose part of me wants to know if that's true, haha.

I know it's completely out of the realm of possibility that the full amount of this debt will be paid off by next June, when the introductory period for the big bad boy CC with the $12.5k balance closes. I have to be okay with that. Does it make sense, then, in between to just hack away at this mountain, let my credit score rebound some, and then hope that by June it's recovered enough for me to qualify for either (1) another CC with an introductory rate? (2) opening a credit line on my home with a lower interest rate? (3) other options that I'm not thinking of?

Sorry for such a longwinded post. I'd go back and tidy it up or bottom line it better with a TL;DR but I'm sort of hanging by a thread here and am looking for a little grace. Thanks in advance for anyone able to provide it.",finance,1436845289

personalfinance,Just clicked submit for the remaining balance on my car loan!!! Up next: Student Loans.,"Hey /r/personalfinance! I just wanted to say thank you so much for everything that you do here. I have been religiously reading (lurking) this subreddit for just about 2 years now and it has helped me get my life in order after making a moderately questionable financial decision right out of college.
 
I started typing this out and ended up with a rambling mess. Instead of that, enjoy the semi-abridged version of my story:

I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from a decent Engineering school with $110k of student loans: $29k Federal, $83k private. I had 1.5 years of paid internships with a single company. During the internshipts I had contributed 11% +4% match to the company 401k, participated in ESPP when I could, and received the end of year bonuses. While that did set me up pretty nicely for long term savings/investments, I had very little to show financially in terms of tuition offsets or real savings (see the astronomical loan amounts). During my senior year, I received a $70k offer from the same company I did my internships with. I also received a $8k sign-on and relocation bonus which was taxed as income. Naturally I accepted and am still in that position today. I enjoy it and see myself doing very well here.

As seen from the large student loan amounts, I did not go through college in a financially responsible way. Better yet, I like cars and motorcycles. The only smart vehicle purchase I made was the $5k car I bought during year 2 of school before my first internship. I paid for this in cash with money I had saved during high school. Unfortunately I 'reimbursed myself' in the loan amount for that year. Whatever, it was just a loan. My grandmother passed away, and I received $1500, which was promptly spent on a motorcycle. During year 3 of school, the first bike died. I sold it for $500 in parts and bought a $4k bike with cash that probably came from a bonus check.  During senior year, I started following the release of the GT86/FRS/BRZ. I knew I wanted that car. I just had to have it. Knowing what city I was moving to, and the state of the roads, I sold the motorcycle and planned to use some of my sign on bonus + trade in my old car for the BRZ Limited (the top trim of course). 

In August 2013, I had saved up what I thought I could and was just itching to pull the trigger. I negotiated to the payment I could afford. So $23k loan at 3.75% with a $360/mo payment for 6 years. Hello -$130k net worth. 
Not one month later did I finally see how much school actually cost me. I was looking at a total of $750/mo in student loan payments. So just out of college, I was on the hook for $1000/month loan payments, living in a downtown apartment for $1200/month and spending a lot of money elsewhere on food, bars, entertainment, etc. I was freaking out wondering how I could make this all work.

Around this time, I discovered r/personalfinance. Man you guys put things into perspective. I got out the loan amortization spreadsheets, started budgeting, etc. My girlfriend moved down 6 months later when she graduated and we started splitting rent and other things. Even though it wasn't the best in terms of total interest paid over my life, I decided to focus on the car. It is a tangible thing with value I could dump if absolutely necessary. I was able to make double payments regularly and also build up my emergency fund to a comfortable level.

By August 2014, I had $18k left. I really wanted this loan gone. Since August, I have started using the ESPP for the 15% bonus, paid all available cash, end of year bonus, and tax return as payments. As of today there is a $3800 balance on the loan. I decided I could sacrifice a small amount of savings to go towards paying this off. So I just submitted the final payment! I paid off $23k in 2 years after feeling like I was drowning in -$130k debt.

I realize I still have $108k left in student loans, but this was the first step. I know that its possible with a LOT of determination and discipline. 

Thanks r/personalfinance. I really appreciate all of your posts and suggestions. I have accepted what mistakes I have made and have a plan in place to pay this all off. I think having a plan and sticking to it is just as important as the dollars and cents of this area. Whether you are $1k, $5k, $10k, or $200k in the hole, just step back, look at what you can do, and make a plan to execute it. You will be surprised how much peace of mind you have once you have that plan.",finance,1436847859

Forex,"Is there a way to chart out future forecast of major news events such as GDP, interest rates, unemployment, ect ???","Since the economic indicator shows forecasts of the next month, i wonder if there's a way to plot out which of the news indicators are expecting a positive forecast and which ones are expecting a negative/neutral forecast. And than plot it out to a price chart (each indicator will be color coded lines).

I'm just curious how well the price of a currency will line up toward the direction of the forecast news indicators, because we all know that's sort of how 'pricing in' happens. For example, if the future interest rate for AUDUSD was forecast as negative, it'll start pricing it in by the time it reaches the time to release the ratings.

personalfinance,Paying Down my Debt,"I'm around $4000 in CC debt right now as a 21 year old college student. I fucked up, I know. I have never missed a payment and my credit score hovers around 650-670. As of right now I'm scheduled to pay off all debt by June of next year, found via Mint. I make around $2000 a month (in the summer) and around $700 per month Sept.- May, with no real expenses besides my debt as I still live with my parents or am at school during which I spend around $300/month on food, booze, and drugs, all habits besides food that can be kicked. 


I'm aware of the ""avalanche"" debt repayment plan, saying I should throw all the expendable cash I have at the highest interest rate debt. As of right now I have $800 in my ""debt account"", $600 of which I can instantly put towards any of my balances. I have a $750 Amex bill accumulating 20% interest, a $1400 Citi bill accumulating 13% interest, and the remainder of my debt on a couple of other accounts that cost me roughly $100/month in minimum payments, but don't accumulate any interest for 10+months. 

Here's my question. Right now, the Amex bill and the Citi Bill accumulate roughly the same amount each month in interest charges. Which one should I focus more of my resources on? I could pay off my entire Amex bill at the end of this week with a couple clicks of a mouse, but that would leave me dead broke. I could put a sizable dent in my Citi debt that would pay off an old balance transfer that is set to start earning interest again at the end of next month. My third option would be to wait until the end of this month to do anything, at which point in time I will have another $1500 to work with. 

Any suggestions as to what may be the best course of action is very much appreciated. This is starting to affect my mental well being.",finance,1436878678

I recently defended my dissertation and will start having to pay back the federal loans I accrued while pursuing my doctorate in six months. I am also expecting the birth of my son next month, and my wife is tired of living in our apartment after 5 years and wants to start exploring buying a house. I work at a college as an institutional researcher and plan to stay in nonprofits throughout my career.

personalfinance,"I owe Drexel University $55,000, and am unsure what to do","Hello, I am currently a sophomore at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Back in February, a hold was placed on my account (meaning I can't access my grades or my transcripts or most of Drexel's online services.) When I went to go investigate, I learned that I was denied all of the federal financial aid I was rewarded. This is because, in October of last year, Drexel ran a ""satisfactory academic progress"" report, to which I was just under the line (the minimum is a GPA or a 2.0, at the time I had a 1.97.) In the meantime I have tried to apply for private loans to try and cover the debt but I, nor anyone I know, have good enough credit for any kind of loan this substantial.

It is worth mentioning that I am currently employed. Drexel offers a co-op program in which you work for half of the year, and go to classes for the other half. I do get paid at my job provided by Drexel.

I was thinking about quitting school and finding an apartment in the city somewhere, and finding a new job once my employment at my current job ends (it's a six month cycle and there is no option to stay hired on at my current position after these six months.) However I am unsure what tools or resources I can take advantage of in order to find an apartment or a job.

Any and all advice about any of this is greatly appreciated. I am willing to answer any questions you may have if anything I said was confusing and unclear. Thank you.

EDIT: I should clarify that, at the end of the quarter in which they ran the progress report, I had gotten my GPA above a 2.0. This was after they ran the report, though, so it didn't make any difference.

EDIT 2: I just wanted to thank you all for all of the great advice that I've been given.

Capital One 360 has a $100 bonus for having $10k in savings for 90 days, and has a 0.75% interest rate.

Ally has a 0.99% interest rate, but doesn’t have the $100 bonus.  

Barclay has a 1.05% interest rate with bonuses for making deposits for six consecutive months and for not making withdrawals for 6 consecutive months. The bonuses are 2.5% applied to interest accrued.

Barclay sounds like the best bet and that aligns with the [advice in this r/personal finance thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ogsw1/high_interest_savings_account_09_apy/) from over a year ago.

personalfinance,Asset forfeiture and net operating loss,"I was sued by the federal goverment back in 2013. It was a civil forfeiture case against my company, wherein all my tangible assets and bank accounts were seized. The lawsuit never went to court and end up being settled by the government, however it took them two years to sort things out. So my company was inoperable and to much extent destroyed during that time. Here's the question. I incurred significant legal expenses as a result of a two year legal battle. Tangible assets depreciated by 40 percent. Credit cards and score went down the hill. I owed around 14k in federal and state income taxes prior to the lawsuit, and wanted to pay when right before the lawsuit was brought. So my question is about net operating loss. From what I understand NOL can go back three years or 20 years forward and can be applied towards the tax bill. I am not too sure about timeframes, so basically my question boils down to this - can I use NOL to apply to my previous tax debt? With tangible asset depreciation and legal expenses I lost a lot more than what I owe, so logic prompts I should be able to apply that to forward earnings as well. Am I wrong on this one?

Some background: My fiancee and I each make about 45K per year, however in addition to his yearly income, Fiancee receives a bonus of approximately 15K every December. This amount can fluctuate (or disappear, technically). We are looking to get married in November 2016 and purchase a home in the 160K-180K range in December 2016, as our apartment lease is up November 30th. My parents are contributing pretty heavily to the wedding expenses, leaving our projected costs at about 5K.

Fiancee and I had earmarked his 2015 ~15K bonus for a downpayment on the house, and we have an additional $7K to add to it. Neither of us has any debt, and we own two cars (his is 8 years old, mine is 10) that are paid off.

The issue I presented in the link above is that Fiancee told his parents that he would give/loan his car to his mother when her car lease is up in October 2016, a month before the wedding and house purchase. We expect her to return the car, however at this point there is no specific time frame in which she needs to return it. This means he would need to purchase another car for himself, and I know that this won't be good for our mortage rates. What he wants to do is push back the house purchase 1 year into December 2017, use the 2015 bonus to pay a huge chunk of the car, and use the 2016 bonus for the downpayment on the house.

My secondary concern is that I will then need to purchase a newer car by 2017, which means we will have two new-ish auto loans on our credit report when we apply for the mortage.

There was discussion in the previous thread that perhaps we aren't as ready to purchase a home as we thought (for a variety of reasons you're welcomed to read about in the link), so at this point I am confused. How bad would two new-ish auto loans hurt our interest rates? Would it help if I replaced my car in 2016 instead of 2017 if we did decide to wait on the house?",finance,1436891704

Trading,Trader sues CBOE for sell fraudulent options,"In what can only be described as scandal the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) is being sued for selling fraudulent options.  The issues surround the UVYX, a popular volatility ETF and outdated adjustment rules that changed the value of the options during a reverse stock split.

The reverse stock spit process is normally a trivial exercise.  Nothing changes except the price of the stock and the number of shares available for trading.  The issuer issues the reverse stock split and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), the guarantor of all options traded on the CBOE, makes an adjustment to the options.

While it is common knowledge throughout the industry that reverse stock splits do not change the value of the stock or the rights of options holders, the OCC issued an adjustment to the UVXY reverse stock split on January 24th, 2014 that changed the rights and the value of the UVXY options.  Knowing the impossible nature of the adjustment, the trader notified both the OCC and the CBOE of the error.  Strangely rather than acknowledging the error and fixing the issue, the OCC and CBOE began colluding to defraud the trader.  

Everyone knows that reverse stocks splits cannot change the value of options.  Options are contracts that grant holders the rights to buy or sell stock at a set price.  Those rights do not change during reverse stock splits.  However, the CBOE and the OCC decided to stick with the error and defraud the investor.  The OCC stated they would consider future changes to the rule that defrauded the investor.  The CBOE employees originally told the trader that the CBOE was aware that there was a problem.  However, after president of the OCC stated that he was satisfied with the adjustment and nothing would change, the CEO of the CBOE reversed course and told the trader he was misinterpreting the communication with CBOE staff.

Strangely, the CBOE has continued to list options for which the current rules do not work and the OCC has failed to update the adjustment rules.  The legal proceedings are underway as the trader has filed a lawsuit in federal court.

Anyhoo, my wife and I are about to inherit around ~$100k and we're trying to decide where to put the money to get the most out of it.  Here are the specifics:

1) Our home is worth around $175k, and we still owe ~$100k on it, 30 year fixed, 3.375% interest rate.  If my calculations are correct, paying it off saves us ~$63k on interest we won't need to pay in the future.

2)  I've set up a spreadsheet to do some modeling for splitting the money and investing some or all.  We wouldn't invest it in a lump sum (probably aim to dollar cost average it or something), but based on expected return yada yada we get a variety of figures.  What are good planning numbers for an expected annual return based on a balanced portfolio of investments?  We're talking to a couple companies about consolidating our investments and have gotten a variety of numbers...

3) My gut is telling me it makes the most sense to pay off the mortgage, save the $63k, then begin to invest what we would have been paying on the mortgage - but I also wonder if I'm not considering all the angles - such as mortgage interest deductions, for example.  We are both running fairly new small business, so our total yearly income is $65k or so, but I expect that to increase quite a bit over the next few years as our businesses grow.

Anyway, any and all comments and thoughts are welcome.  If I've neglected to provide some needed info, let me know and I'll add it.  Thanks!",finance,1436896304

Bitcoin,Ron Paul's supporters are being politically targeted by the IRS again. This time they want more financial information about donors.,"I've been bracing for this for months now. 

Recently, my attorneys informed me the IRS has launched a new attack on Campaign for Liberty. 

The IRS is now demanding sensitive contributor information on C4L supporters going all the way back to 2012! 

I've instructed Campaign for Liberty staff to give them absolutely nothing until I hear from you. 

This assault is flat-out UNCONSTITUTIONAL and illegal. 

But I'm not naïve. 

I know that more legal threats and hefty fines designed to cripple Campaign for Liberty – or even force us to shut our doors – are right around the corner. 

And I don't think it's any accident this is happening right in the midst of our fights to finally audit the Federal Reserve and stop the NSA's out-of-control domestic spying schemes! 

But the truth is, I have a decision to make - a critical decision that could affect Campaign for Liberty's very survival in the months ahead. 

Do I fight on? Do I risk everything? Do I tell the statist IRS to go fly a kite? 

Or should Campaign for Liberty just pay up, keep our head down, and hope this never happens again? 

I'm afraid those are my only options. 

That's why I urgently need your advice. 

So, I've included a special ""IRS Battle Survey"" with this letter. Will you please fill it out, and return it to me right away? 



The truth is, I must hear from you IMMEDIATELY. 

Even after Campaign for Liberty members and supporters finally forced the IRS to back down during our standoff last year, I knew there would be more assaults in the works. 

And as I warned you not long ago, my worry was they would try to weaken our liberty movement right in the midst of our most critical legislative efforts – right when it matters most! 

Now – with congressional fights over NSA spying and the Federal Reserve smearing anyone who dares question their secrecy - it's happening. 

What the IRS is demanding from Campaign for Liberty is contributor information on some of our top donors - pointing to a rarely enforced and unconstitutional bureaucratic rule. 

As a 501(c)(4) organization under IRS law, all Campaign for Liberty contributor information is supposed to be confidential. 

This is a critical protection I wholeheartedly support. 

Privacy and liberty go hand-in-hand. 

When Thomas Paine published his pamphlet Common Sense in 1776, he did so anonymously. 

Forcing organizations like Campaign for Liberty to publicize donor information would have an incredibly chilling effect on political free speech. 

Many liberty-loving Americans would silence themselves for fear of becoming targets of political ""retribution."" 

And after the Obama IRS was caught red-handed targeting pro-limited government groups for harassment and intimidation, these fears could not be more well-founded. 

So there's no way I would ever just hand this kind of information over to these government bureaucrats. 

That's not an option. Campaign for Liberty is prepared to lead this fight on behalf of all freedom-loving Americans. But I need you to tell me what to do. Please tell me how I should respond to this new IRS threat. 



When we filed annual reports with the IRS as required by law, we refused to provide this information. 

Now, the IRS is demanding this information – from all the way back in 2012! 

But the truth is, the IRS has only occasionally sought to ""enforce"" their ridiculous rule. 

And for good reason. Several years ago, the National Organization for Marriage complied with IRS demands and promptly saw their donor information publicized. The IRS was forced to pay a fine to the organization and issue a public apology. 

I'm afraid the real reason they're coming after Campaign for Liberty is something far more sinister. 

They know more Americans are beginning to agree with you and me. 

They know our r3VOLution is growing stronger by the day. 

Americans are fed up with BOTH parties' out-of-control spending, unconstitutional spying, backroom ""deals,"" and weekly assaults on our remaining freedoms. 

That's why Campaign for Liberty is being targeted. 

That's why the statists in BOTH parties want so much to shut us up and shut us down. 

I'm afraid without your support and advice today, they could very well get their wish. 



I have no doubt if I took the IRS to court over its ridiculous demands, Campaign for Liberty would win, hands down. 

But I'm afraid that's not what this is about. 

Campaign for Liberty is run on a shoestring budget. 

We don't have millions lying around in the bank. 

This is about draining us. 

This is about forcing me to take resources from other critical programs like Audit the Fed just to keep our doors open! 

That's why I want so badly to just say ""NO!"" 

But without an IMMEDIATE influx of funds, I'm afraid we'll be sitting ducks. 

I just won't be able to pay for everything. 

But the alternative could be worse. 

Paying any fine the IRS levies and complying with the IRS' demands - just to exercise our rights as American citizens to petition our government – may be cheaper in the short run. 

But it'll simply embolden the IRS and an alphabet soup of other federal agencies to come after us. 

This is the price you pay for daring to stand up to a federal government that wants to keep taxing, spending, and printing every American into the poorhouse. 

So what do I do? 

Won't you please fill out your ""IRS Battle Survey"" right away?



I'm going to ask my staff to tally up the votes, and I will proceed as C4L's generous members and supporters tell me to. 

The decision is in your hands. 

But if you tell me to fight, please realize this is serious. 

Any potential legal fight is going to take money - money Campaign for Liberty does not have lying around. 

This is the IRS we're talking about. This is not a game. 

So I must ask all Campaign for Liberty supporters to chip in a contribution of $10 right away. 

This is not something I can just put off. I need to hear from you right away. I'm anxiously awaiting your response. 

Please fill out your ""IRS Battle Survey"" and agree to chip in an emergency contribution of $10 TODAY. 

For Liberty 


Ron Paul 
Chairman 

P.S. The IRS has struck again. Campaign for Liberty received a letter DEMANDING we turn over sensitive contributor information to the IRS! 

The statists' goal is to cripple Campaign for Liberty and perhaps even force us to shut our doors. So I need you to tell me how I should respond to this new IRS threat using your ""IRS Battle Survey."" 

And if you possibly can, please agree to chip in a contribution to help Campaign for Liberty fight back TODAY!",cryptocurrency,1436899045

personalfinance,Opportunity to buy half of a house in So. Cal.,"Background info:

-My mom and aunt own my grandparents’ house after my grandma passed this year.

-My mom wants to keep the house (and possibly rent it out) but her sister wants to sell  ASAP since she has plans to move out of state and is depending on her half of the house to put a down payment on her new home.

-The house is in dire need of renovations but is in livable condition. We hired a realtor and he assumes he can sell the house for 350k which we all think is an absolutely absurd assumption and that nobody would be willing to pay that much for a house in the condition that it is in (nobody has lived there for ~10 years).

-Realistically, we think we MIGHT get 300k by selling as-is since neither party is willing to put money into renovations. 

Recently it came up that my aunt is willing to let me buy her out for her half of the house and forego her ownership to me. She will probably want about 100-150k cash upfront from me. She isn’t willing to let me pay her in payments and is being very stubborn about that. 

As a 24 year old who has only been working for a year, does this seem like a good investment to make?

I make ~40k at my current job and have ~25k in savings. I live rent-free with my parents and don’t have any debt or financial obligations other than gas, necessities, etc.

I have no experience with loans or homeownership and would like some advice on what my options are. I’m assuming my only option is to take out a personal loan. This worries me since I know the interest rates tend to be much higher for these types of loans even though I have a good credit score. 

My main fear is that I will end up in unnecessary financial hardship that is easily avoidable. However, I can also see this opportunity as a great investment that might make money tight for the next ~ 10 years or so of my life, but I’d rather go through that while I still live at home and don’t have other priorities.

Is taking out ~100k going to be difficult for someone in my situation?

My parents are willing to let me live there and even help with necessary renovations and I can foresee them eventually giving me full ownership of the property later in life for less than what it’s actually worth. It’s in a decent neighborhood , is a good size for a small family, and living there has always been something I’ve dreamed of but never have the financial means for. For 100k it seems like a great investment that I should take even though I never had any intentions of owning property this soon in life. 

Are there any potential problems with dual ownership that I might not be aware of right now?

Is this way too big of a loan to take out considering my financial situation?

If anybody has been in a similar situation or could give some advice, any help is greatly appreciated :)",finance,1436899912

I'm a 22 year old, 2015 graduate with a B.A. in Business Administration and Political Economy from a small private liberal arts college. I have about 41,000$ in federal loans. I'm in grace with estimated 450$ a month payments starting in November. I recently started a 6 month internship where I receive full benefits. I earn 15$ an hour and usually work about 45 hours a week.

personalfinance,"I'm new to managing money, is there something better I could be doing?","Alright, so I'm 19, I've finished a year of school, and this is the first time my parents are leaving managing my money entirely up to me.

I don't have to worry about student loans (I recognize that I am very lucky) so that doesn't need to be a consideration. 

I currently have a US Bank checking account with $1600 in it that I opened in my college town and a Capital One savings account that my parents opened for me years ago and are now giving me control of. This account has $15,800 in it, and this is really what I'm wondering about. The savings account has an interest rate of 0.85% compounded daily, according to my mom, but I have no experience besides casually reading /r/personalfinance to tell if I could move it somewhere better. As of right now, only the checking account is in my name.

Keeping in mind that I have three years left of school and likely won't withdraw anything from savings until after graduation, is there a place where I could move my savings where it would earn more interest than it is right now? If so, how much should I move?

Additionally, will there be any tax issues with my parents giving me control of this money? I know that technically it's in their name, but most of it is money that I have earned on my own.

I think my situation is different from ""I have $X, what should I do with it?"" from the commontopics page since the savings account wont be used for anything for years, I don't have any debt, and my only serious expenses are tuition and housing, which are covered.

I immediately filed a dispute with my credit card company and was told they would look into it.

Now, a few weeks later, I receive a letter saying they've withdrawn the credit extended to me as well as included a  ""receipt"". It's literally a line that says custom amount, tip, total and a signature that isn't mine.

Ill give a little background for setting. I have a friend who we'll call  Georgia. Georgia has a history of anxiety and depression and of also not being forthright in conversations about her personal life. I've known her for two years as she is my little in a sorority and we're close (though it is hard to bond with someone who doesn't tend to confide in anyone). This upcoming year would be our senior year at a private four year institution. Her major is English which I don't understand since it's a math and science school + $55000 in tuition but I figured whatever floats her boat. 

Her parents are both divorced and remarried. She's not on very good terms with her dad because (not sure how correct this is but this is what she told me) he spent her entire $2 million trust as he was the (I forget what its called when the person is in charge of the account till the person is of age). Apparently, there was no legal action she could take against him since he was the manager of the trust and just ""managed"" the money away. On a side  note, he seems well off as he owns many stores of a franchise and is the manager of the region. I'm guessing that's where the trust went. Now additionally, her mother remarried someone who is apparently ""rich"" (unbeknownst to everyone until a couple years ago as he lives at a middle-class level) but I guess is unwilling to help her. Georgia's dad was supposed to be helping with college tuition as per the divorce settlement, if I'm remembering correctly. 

What I'm confused about and she didn't give straight answers to anyone in our friend group is somehow her dad ""effed up her student loans"" so now she can't afford tuition. She didn't give specifics and I'm not trying to really find solutions, but I'd just like to understand how this situation could occur. Please keep in mind, I have little to no knowledge about financials and it is something I need to learn. Thank you in advance for any responses!

personalfinance,Taking out a 4k Loan to Move In To Post Grad Housing,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I am seeking your advice on how to best go about receiving a $4,000 loan as a recent college graduate. I will be using the loan to front the move in costs for an apartment closer to work, with the amount being split between security, first month rent and broker fee. 

I have my parents as co-signers and also have a job offer paying upwards of 50k per year. 

How long can I expect for the entire process to take? Which banks specifically should I consider? What interest rates and minimum payments on the loan can I expect? How long does it usually take to pay such a loan back (in terms of minimum payments - I expect to pay it off much sooner). What documents will I need to present?

financialindependence,Questions About Investing Using a Tax Free Savings Account in Canada (so confused),"Hi, I need to get some of my money out of my savings account where it's just sitting there and start investing it.  I don't really know anything about investing so I've started reading about it.  So far I've read ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi and I'm almost finished reading ""Money, Master the Game"" by Tony Robbins. 

Both these authors though are American and I'm Canadian.  They talk about things like 401(k)s and Roth IRAs which we don't have in Canada.  We do however have Tax Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) which I understand function in much the same way that being you can use it like a bucket to put different investments in. Plus you can put up to $10,000 a year of investments in now, tax free.

I'm currently shopping around for a new bank.  I've visited several banks and credit unions and asked them about their TFSAs and I'm very confused.  Some places treat the TFSA as a slightly better interest rate savings account and some only let you buy a couple of specific GICs or Mutual Funds to put in your TFSA which I'm sure suck and probably make the bank tons of money through fees.

So my question is then where/how do I open a TFSA that I can buy my own things like index funds or bonds to put in.

In ""I Will Teach You How to Be Rich"" the author mentions logging into his online banking, moving money to his 401(k), then using the money to buy an index fund just by searching for the code for the fund.  He did this all through his online banking and then set something up to automatically add money to the fund every month.

This is what I'm looking to do but none of the banks or credit unions I visited seem to be able to do this.

Do I need to go to an investing company like Investor's Group to open the account or somewhere else?

My main debts and concerns are my personal loans which were made for multiple reasons of Medical debt, Debt consolidation, Flipping a house, and other expenses. Those I feel have become greatly out of hand and I need advice and guidance on how to get a better interest rate and consolidate them into one.

My current goals of course are to pay all this down and grin but short term goal is to get my credit good enough to get a consolidation loan with LoFi Loans (rates ranging from 1.99% to 10% with 25,000$-150,000$) so I can stop being a slave to these personal finance companies and get a decent interest rate during this grind to pay them off.

into getting it but wouldn't co-sign for me when the time came. When I first got it I still lived 
at home so the payments were much easier to make. I have since moved out and i've had trouble paying it 
for the last year. It's been a great car and I love it but its getting harder and harder to make the payments.
I have tried refinancing but my loan company does not offer that. I have also gone to other 
banks and have been unsuccessful.

my name besides a fancy cell phone bill. I am going to be attending school in the fall

I have heard of some options but do not know which is best or even possible

So, here are my questions to you, lovely redditors of /r/personalfinance:

I took out federal student loans in 2007 (about $30k worth). I don't have the paperwork anymore, so I don't know what my interest rate was, but I do know that my debt was sold to a collections agency. How do I find out who that is? Also, when I went on creditkarma, it showed that I had student loans, but it said the balance was $0. Does that mean I've *paid* $0 or that it's been written off? Or is creditkarma just useless? It does tell me a balance I have on a credit card (about $1000), which I know is not paid off. It says I have ""missed payments"" but the account is ""closed-transferred""- what does this mean? It just says that it was owed to the US Dept. Of Education, but it does not say who I should actually contact about paying. 

Random question: I'm getting married. Can collections agencies come after my husband for my debts (accrued, of course, outside of the marriage)?

If I pay my little medical debts (I have accounts in collection as low as $79), will that make any kind of meaningful impact on my credit? I'm going to pay them either way, I'm just curious. 

I don't make much money, and the last time I spoke with someone (back in '09) about my student loans, they tried to offer me a payment plan I simply cannot afford, saying it was the lowest they could go. Are there any programs that could helpmewith this if the loans are already in collections? 

According to the wiki, paying off my debts will not increase my credit score. How can I, then? I can't get approved for a credit card, I've tried (according to creditkarma I'm somewhere around 520-530). What do I do?

personalfinance,"I am receiving a full tuition scholarship, what should I do about my direct unsubsidized loan?","I am going into my first year of graduate school and, much to my surprise, I was offered a full tuition scholarship.

personalfinance,Best sequence of events to follow for our situation,"So a little background. Unfortunately this will probably be long, sorry ahead of time. I have serious girlfriend and we want to get married, buy a place (I'm not a fan paying someone else's mortgage), pay off her debt, student loans, and prob end up getting a car in the middle of all of this while we are at it (obviously not in that order).

We are both starting brand new jobs. I finished with my masters in software engineer, she just started her job as a pharmacist. We are going to be living where cost of living is pretty low (Alabama). For now, until we get there and figure out the area we plan on renting a house. It is going to be about the same cost as an apartment which will be around $850/month. Together we are going to have a combined income of pretty close to $200k. 

Me: I have 0 debt, no student debt, no loans, no cc, own my car and have decent amount of savings spread across my bank account, stocks, mutual funds. This is not counting 401k or anything. 

Her: Has some CC debt &lt; 3k, &lt; 10k car left on her car. She has good chunk of change (~260k) in student debt (interest rate ranges from ~5%-7%). The company she works for does provide loan forgiveness. She has two options for this. 1) Pay a monthly premium to pay it off in 10 years. 2) Pay ""up to 15% of her salary"" for 10 years and the remaining balance will be paid by her employer (option 2 to me is really the only option). Her 15% payment would be &lt; than the 10 year repayment plan.

I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of what needs to be done and the series of events we should take to get there. But would like some validation.

1. immediately pay off CC 
2. start putting extra money to pay off her car (I'll be able to pay all living expenses with just my salary). 
3. Start saving for wedding
4. downpayment on house

Details:

I felt the following is best way to do this. With my salary put in max match value my company will match. Put away another 10% or so for ""oh shit"" fund. The rest of my check would go for paying all of our living expense. I figured it up and I'll have about 800$ left each month after all expense. At that point I can put that money towards whatever else needs money.

With her salary. Put in whatever her company matches for 401k, then put ""15%"" (or whatever the loan comes out to be) towards her student debt. Since her company would be paying off the remaining balance at the end of 10 years, I suggested putting the difference of what she would be paying to pay her student loan off in the 10 year timeframe. For example if she had to pay 100 dollars each month to pay it off in 10 years, but she is only having pay 65 to pay it off in 10 years with her employer paying the remaining off at the end of 10 years, I advised she should put the 35$ she would be paying into a mutualfund/stocks/index funds etc. At the end of 10 years she would have a pretty nice chunk of money sitting in the bank to pay off house roll into retirement/investment etc. 

The remaining portion of her check pay off her CC loans with the remaining balance (shouldn't be more than 2 month salary). This estimate includes ~500-1000$ left for spending money (e.g. gas, small entertainment, etc.). At that point the next subsequent months start putting money towards her car. Same as with CC. Whatever is left put towards car payment to pay it off as fast as possible. This I estimate will take roughly a year. 

At this point start saving for a wedding. Again since my salary would be paying living expenses this gives her flexibility to put money towards the wedding. While I personally think a wedding is a ""bad investment"" and could be used for downpayment on a nicer house, along with a slew of other issues, regarding cost, value and ""necessity"", she still wants one. While she would probably thoroughly enjoy a 50k dollar wedding, and especially since we are paying for all of it, I can't justify it. We are almost on complete opposite ends of the spectrum on this but I think we are coming to a compromise. I'm on the low end of 10k (e.g. 11k), she probably slightly on the upper end of 10k (e.g. 18k). I do feel that if we came to a budget of ""15k"" all the unknowns it will end up being closer to 20k. But I digress. I expect to save up for that to be another year or so. 


At this point we would be roughly 2 years in and have paid her CC and car off, paid for a wedding and really only have a house to buy (possibly a car, both of ours have roughly 100k miles on them, I would expect both to last another 5 years or so but I'm trying to plan for worst).

We have a few things to investigate at this point though. She was told that if she puts in the maximum into her 401k (up to 18k/year) that, that would possibly reduce her ""up to 15% loan forgiveness payment"". I actually thought the 15% was calculated off gross income (pre-tax) but I'll have to investigate that more. If that is true, to get the best ""bang for your buck"" to reduce her salary which would reduce the amount she would have to pay towards her student loans each month while keeping the most amount of money she would have to put in the 18k/year. I would be all for this.  I know she wants to get married and that would just reduce the amount of money she would want to put towards her cc debt, car debt and the wedding. I realize we could not put the money in now and ""adjust"" this later but I don't like the idea of that. I feel that if you never see the money you would never use the money. I think it would be too easy to see that money going towards, CC debt, car payment, wedding payment etc and not do it later when you already see that money. Is this reasonable or am I off base here thinking that we should just get the ""necessities"" (CC, car payment, wedding) paid for?

So I guess I'm kinda looking for validation, opinions on the approach we are taking. I hate to be spending the money on rent when we could get in the house, but I don't want to stretch our self too thin while paying off her stuff to ""rush"" into a house. I have enough for a downpayment of a house but don't really want to ""drain"" my savings to put a downpayment on a house to rush into anything either. This is the best series of events that I can think of to accomplish our goals in the quickest amount of time without pissing money away on interest payments. 

I know this is pretty long but does this look reasonable? Did I miss anything major? This might be too much to wade through online, if so where should we turn to look for advice. Anything would be great.

On the flipside he himself has said that the point of the last rate cut was to entice business spending but for most part just racked up more consumer debt which was not the goal. So maybe a no change decision to keep the status quo for another month.5 and see what the data shows.

[Monthly](http://puu.sh/iZyU3/a5b0e08659.png) we're at heavy resistance and think a no change decision will occur keeping us in this range we've been in since the last cut. Getting above 1.3 would be a big deal

personalfinance,Let's talk about student loan debt,"I went to a fantastic 4 year university and graduated with a bachelors degree, on top of that, a plethora of personal development, life skills, leadership training, and priceless experiences that come together to form what was my college experience. I took full advantage of my time in college, by taking my classes seriously (even when they were general ed or electives), living on campus which taught me invaluable lessons in life and provided added support, participating in campus activities and clubs which kept me engaged in college by providing avenues to meet people and be a part of the community and taught me communication and teamwork skills, and by getting various on campus jobs which both ensured that I had money to utilize and the personal development and professional skills gained through my on campus jobs were just as much important in my success as a professional as the piece of paper I earned as proof that I succeeded though college. To me, college was worth every penny of the loans I took out to pay for it, my problem arises when I look at my interest rates.

As a 17 year old I was placed in front of a computer and told to take out student loans. at that time I had only worked 1 job at a family run store and had a bank account I was not allowed to touch so I never even looked at it. I couldn't fathom what taking out $10,000 each year meant, all I knew was that from the time I began school I was told that going to college was the equivalent to success. My financial aid adviser assured me that my financial package was pretty good and made it a point to mention over and over that everyone has student loans and they are the easiest type of loan to pay off. In order to accept my loans I had to click through what felt like an hour of an online loan coarse (which 17 year old me of course read none of while I was watching TV at the same time), and there it was, I had paid for my first semester of college.

I knew when signing up for loans that there would be interest. My financial aid rep. showed me numbers like 3.4 and 6.8 telling me they were good or average, and told me some would change and some wouldn’t. I was told interest meant the amount of my loan was going to grow a bit over the years, an avoidant set of words, belittling the truth of how 6.8 would change the current amount of loan I was taking out to a significantly larger number.

Fast forward to two years ago, I am a fresh college grad, excited to take on the world. Receiving my first student loan bill was exciting, an odd reaction I know, but I was proud to have already secured a full time job and place to live. My first payment wouldn't be $50 and a phone call begging for lower payments, no I could sign up for income-driven repayments and send off $550 a month. Surely I was ahead of the game! Month two rolled around and when I compared the bill I was stunned at how little my $550 had actually payed for. I had known there would be interest rates, but clearly I needed to learn more.

My student loans are all through Great lakes and the way they are set up is that I have 2 accounts that are made up of various smaller loans taken out throughout my college career. Each of those smaller loans have varying amounts and interest rates. When I log in to pay my monthly bill I press one button and apply my fee to the total amount, seeing how it is split between my two accounts. I never need to look at the individual loans unless I decide to go on a goose hunt to find the proper buttons to lead me to a breakdown and in order for me to see how that money is applied to them, I needed to sign up for an outside source website to help me analyze them which can only provide an estimate of how they are being paid. Sure I can call in to ask, but the reality of this is that nobody wants to play 20 questions with someone on the other end of the phone, and millennials are inherently fearful of phones due to growing up texting and instant messaging, only needing to take a call for negative things such as doctors’ appointments or that crazy aunt who talks for hours.

So here I am today, 2 years into paying down what started as $44,000 of student loans to pay off. Since beginning my payments I have payed $10,192.98, bringing the remainder of my student loans due down to a total of $42,519.68 (note that interest was accruing and not being paid down while I was in school on some of those loans). You’ve read that correctly, my 10k has paid for $1480.32 of my schooling 100% of my loans are government student loans. That is the weight of the interest placed on my loans.

Seeing this made me decide to apply all of my extra payment money (anything I add over the minimum payment) to the loan with the highest interest rate to work them down. This way instead of paying 10 loans and their individual interests for the entirety of the time I’m paying off loans, I can begin to pick off loans, saving thousands on interest. Upon searching for a way to do this the answer I was given is I need to call each month and speak to a rep, directing them where it will go, making sure to wright down their name and watch my account for the next week to ensure the money is actually applied correctly. Every month I must do this.

College was worth every penny for me, and I am glad to pay the university I went to for the experience I had and the things I learned, I would surely appreciate lower tuition costs, but I am glad to pay them either way for what I got. What needs to change the most is the interest rates on student loans. Time after time I hear about these new gimmicks offered to “relive pressure” from student loans, consolidation, for instance, getting a new lower interest rate loan to pay off your current higher interest ones sounds great, but read the fine print and you find that that lower interest rate only lasts so long before it shoots to higher than your original rate, so unless you can pay off your loan twice as fast, you’re in trouble.

People are calling for lower tuition rates, but the interest is what is really kicking people down. Lower tuition rates means less money for your college, lower interest rates means less money for the banks and the government.

I have an education in finance and investing and invest all of my own savings that is not in this db plan.

Through lots of hard work, living within our means, and a little good fortune....
My wife and I own our house and cars and would prefer not to move.  I'm 45, she is 49.  We have $600K in cash, $75K each in RRSPs, $45K each in TFSAs, a cabin ($225K), and over $1 million in commercial real-estate.  The income is good when it is rented but of the 2 units, only 1 is currently rented and the other lease is due this year and the economy is soft so I want to be cautious about including the income or value in my plans.  The only debt is $180K mortgage on a $200K residential rental.

My wife has a defined benefit pension plan that will pay $3,000 per month starting in 7 years for the rest of our lives (indexed to 60% of inflation).

I also have a defined benefit plan and if I quit my job today I have 3 options:
A) Leave it in the plan until I am 65 (19 years) and receive about $3,100 per month for the rest of our lives.
B) Leave it in the plan until I am 55 and then take it out...at an undetermined amount.   It may increase due to passage of time, but could be negatively impacted by any number of risks (rising interest rates, reduction in plan benefits (note the plan is only 79% funded and there was an earlier plan to reduce benefits on a go forward basis that was cancelled but is still being discussed).
c) Withdraw $600K today consisting of $130K immediate taxable payout and $470K that gets transferred into a Locked in Retirement Account

My thoughts are that assuming a top marginal tax rate I'd pay about $50K of tax immediately in option C, and be left with $550K before tax.  If I could earn an average of 6.5% that is equivalent to the $3,000 per month starting today (not in 19 years) and never touch the principal.

Although 6.5% might be a challenge for the next several years, given our current financial strength it seems like the right choice.  Under option A, if we both passed early not only would the principal amount of the wifes plan disappear, but so would mine.

With a few minor cuts we could live on $6,000 per month easily.  $8,000 per month would be a care free retirement of current lifestyle or better.

So - do you think I can quit my job today assuming I never work again?  If I do should I take the lump sum payout of my pension?

personalfinance,Got a full ride to college and parents are giving me the college fund money.,"Hello, 
Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I'm naturally a lurker here but I came out of the murky depths because I wanted some advice on what to do in my predicament. (Please forgive me if the formatting is bad)
 
First off, I am currently a junior at my state university studying towards a BS in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Aerospace Engineering. 

Let me next explain my financial situation. I am an ARMY ROTC cadet on a full ride (tuition only). As well as ROTC, I also have a state scholarship that pays $10K/year and another $1500/semester from making the Dean's List. 

These scholarships are first applied to my tuition where I am then reimbursed by the Army. So, before every semester, I receive a reimbursement check for around $6500 which I use to pay for room and board. My rent is $600/month and I'd say I spend around an average of $240/month on food during the school year. So if you do the math, I end up netting around $3K/semester from school. I also receive a stipend from ROTC which will be $375/month this year (it increases every year by $25). Doing the subjective math, I will  net about $4500 a semester from school this year. This, of course, doesn't include other expenses. I know I am extremely fortunate to be in this situation and honestly, I worked my ass off for it. I am also doing a co-op with a utility company in my state and I am in my second term of it. I make $20/hr working full time with 401k benefits. I place 10% of my paycheck into my 401k and my employer matches 6%.

Now the predicament at hand!

My parents recently brought up to me that they were planning on giving me the money they had saved up for my college education. One of the reasons I decided to do ROTC was to save my parents from the burden of paying for my education and prevent myself from going into debt with student loans. The money they have saved for my education is all in US Treasury bonds and totals around $40k. I know that I will have to pay taxes on the money once the bonds are cashed. My dad said we would talk about that soon. The reason I came to PF is because I don't know how I want to move forward with this money. I know that I am not going to use it to buy a new car. I plan on milking the shit out of my vehicle until it kicks the bucket and it should last me another 10 years minimum (gotta love Toyotas). I also know that since I will commissioning into the Army in a few years, I'm most likely not going to be buying a house anytime soon. I am definitely set on investing a portion of it. I haven't decided how much but probably not more than 75%. Now, I'm not completely clueless on investing. I've done a lot of research using TDAmeritrade's website  and other investing literature. Definitely not a pro, I just like to be educated before I jump into things. I've wanted to get into investing for the past few years but I have been too afraid to make a mistake and lose money. I want to use this money to set myself for a bright future and I know that I can do that if I make smart decisions now. The bonds have an average interest rate of 2.5%(loose calculation). I feel that I can do much better than that.

How can I allocate this money to make the most of this situation?

personalfinance,Husband refinancing his car with my name on it. Is that a good idea,"My husband and I have been working on improving our credit scores. We consolidated our credit card debts, each with their own 18% interest rate, into a small unsecured loan at 10.75%. In doing that, we reduced our credit utilization to almost 0%. We also paid in full a medical bill on his credit report. We were unaware that it had been on his credit report for roughly 2 years, but we should've been checking it periodically. Paying the medical bill in full removed the negative mark from my husband's credit report and made it jump drastically. 

My credit score is roughly 650, due to a high percentage of my credit utilization, as well as my oldest line of credit only being 2.5 years old. 

My husband and I are working on improving my credit score. His suggestion was to refinance his car in both our names, rather than just his, that way the installment loan will show on my credit report. Refinancing my husband's car would take the interest rate from 8.5% to 4.75%.  

However, in asking my father-in-law for advice, my FIL felt that while my credit score would take a small hit initially, refinancing would be a good idea for improving my credit score in the long run.

Also, many people know me as the colored coins developer, but this article has nothing to do with colored coins. Or alt-coins, for that matter._

## Transactional money

The money as we know can be described transactional: e.g. you transfer your money to merchant, and he transfers goods to you. This exchange is called a transaction.

However, we also often deal with money streams (or flows) where price is specified as a rate of flow, that is, amount of money per unit of time, e.g.:

 * the wage you receive froom employer can be specified in dollars per hour
 * appartment rent is specified in dollars per month
 * phone calls might be billed on per second basis
 * interest rate, etc.

Usually we just multiply the rate by the amount of time and pay that amount before or after resource is consumed. But you also do the artithmetic with the rates if you convert them to same time unit, e.g.:

 * +$100 per day from employer
 * -$20 per day to pay rent
 * -$1 per day for phone subscription
 * ...

So after calculating all these daily expenses you might find that you earn $20 per day which you can put into your savings account. But this is just an average over a long time frame, in reality the value on your account might fluctuate because, e.g., you pay the rent in the beginning of month, but receive a payment from employer in the end, so without some kind of a buffer of money you cannot make ends meet.

## Flow money

But what if we could not only do this as an arithmetic excercise, but actually work with flows of money directly? Of course, it is simply not feasible to do this with physical forms of money like coins and banknotes, but if money is fully computerized, this is at least theoretically possible: computers can do calculations with rates just as good as with amounts.

Flow money can exist alongside with normal transactional money, e.g. parties might instruct their bank about the desired flows, it will do the calculation and will eventually do the settlement using normal money. But it can also exist as a **primary form of money**, where we will deal with rates, not amounts as the primary concepts, and amounts can be used as a helper concept. That is, flow money replaces:

 * payments with flows
 * amounts with rates

Now there is a number of questions:

 * How could this work?
 * Why is it useful?
 * What are interesting properties of flow money?
 * How can we bridge flow money with transactional money, use them together in one system, or inter-operating systems?
 * How is it related to cryptocurrencies?

We will try to answer them further in this article.

## Useful properties

As was noted above, one obvious potentially useful property is that with flow money you don't have a liquidity gaps, and thus don't need buffer money: e.g. as soon as you get a nice job, you can afford a nice apparetment, phone, etc. Thus you don't need to borrow money to cover liquidity gap you have.

But the most important property of flow money is that you cannot spend it. The concept of spending is just not defined: you don't spend it, you reallocate it.
(Originally it was called declarative money to highlight that you _declare_ a flow rather than _make_ a payment.) This has a number of interesting consequences:

 * you won't regret bad spending, because you can reallocate at any time
 * you won't waste money on a bad investment: you invest your flow into a certain enterprise, but if it turns out to be bad you just withdraw that flow and use it for something else
 * this kind of money can't be stolen because everything is reversible
 * you can freely tip or donate this kind of money as you wish, as you aren't actually spending it

(Note: flow money was invented after an observation that many investments in cryptocurrency space go bad; thus it would be interesting to have a mechanism to let investors to recoup their losses. A special kind of cryptocurrency rules (which can be implemented via colored coins) can help here, but flow money is a limit form of it, where you just don't have losses.)

## Practical applications

While flow money come with a set of interesting properties, it also comes with a lot of weird traits. For example, something as simple as buying a loaf a bread becomes not simple at all.

In theory, we could replace normal money with flow money and find workarounds to solve the problems it creates. But it's more realistic to assume that flow money will coexist with normal transaction money (if it will exist at all, that is), and hence flow money will only be used in spheres where it makes sense.

What are they? We need to look for something which doesn't work very well with normal money.

I believe that one of these areas is interenet tipping. Even if it is easy to make a tip (which was pioneered by bitcointip here on reddit, and later expanded by changetip), it is still somewhat awkward: tipping $0.01 is offensive, while tipping $1.00 is expensive. I received many tips, but they didn't make any significant diffence for me, and I just used them to tip other people.

So we have a situation where money circulates within a group of people tipping each other (in fact I've seen people tipping back right in the reply), and only ""jerks"" who do not tip profit from this. So it seems that transactional money is ill-fit for tips: to hard to decide an amount, whether to tip or not, etc.

Can flow money be applied here? Yes. For example, it can be integrated with reddit upvotes (or Facebook likes): each time you upvote a comment, it is recorded in some sort of a centralized or decentralized database. Then using in-flows and out-flows we can compute a popularity rank of each user similar to how Google computes PageRank of web pages using in-flow/out-flow links. (To do this we'll need some a priori weighting, otherwise it can be trivially be manipulated; e.g. on /r/bitcoin we could count people who own more than 0.1 BTC as a source nodes, it can serve as an anti-Sybil measure.) What do we do with this popularity rank then?

One thing is that a reddit-like system could prioritize posts according to popularity rank of the poster, as frequently-upvoted people tend to post more relevant content. Thus it can improve quality of collaborative filtering. After 8 years on reddit I've noticed a clear correlation between size of community and quality of content: as community grows bigger, it starts to cater to the lowerst common denominator (the most accessible content is the most upvoted), so overall quality goes down. More intelligent collaborative filtering could, at least in theory, prevent this. Also it can be relevant to ""decentralized reddit"" kind of application where Sybil attack prevention is harder.

But also it is possible to bridge it with regular money, e.g. users will pool their money and donate to highest-ranking members after some time. This solves the problem with initial weights: users who are contributing to the pool become the source of the flow. This makes sense, as those are likely the users who are geniunely interested in a discussion and are willing to put their money where their mouth is. Compared to simple tipping, it is much less arbitrary and dependent on generosity of tippers, and also offers an opportunity to improve collaborative filtering/content quality.

Other possible uses include compensation for creation of content, exchanging one kind of labor for another within a network of people, etc.

## Flow money economy

If we imagine flow money being used on a wider scale, then a subscription model can be used to bridge a gap between discretely consumer goods and continuous flows. E.g. instead of buying a loaf of bread you can pay for bread subscription and receive a certain amount of it each day.

This model is already used for food on all-inclusive resorts, but also it used for equipment leasing and [even for consumer laptops](http://www.alphr.com/news/hardware/239313/fujitsu-siemens-offers-free-laptop-upgrades-for-life). So, potentially, it can be used for all kinds of goods, although it might be somewhat inconvenient or strange (at least until we get familiar with it).

One interesting aspect of it is that business can be created without investments. E.g. a certain area lacks a backery, an entrepreneur can ask interested people to declare backery subscriptions, then use this inflow to rent the necessary equipment and recruit people.

## A bridge with regular currencies

Just like it is possible to convert between currencies using exchanges, it's also possible to exchange between flow and transactional money using bank-like entities. E.g. a quasi-bank can offer to pay XXX money for a flow of YYY sent to it for one month, and also offer a flow of YYY for one month if individual makes a payment of XXX. So by matching different kinds of demands it can earn its comission.

It's also possible that a cryptocurrency will have both flow and transactional components and allow conversion between the two. E.g. if you receive an inflow, you can materialize it in form of regular money.

## Flow money and cryptocurrencies

Flow money can implemented as a cryptocurrency: each entity will use its private key to sign declarations of flow (which are like Bitcoin transactions in that regard), which will be included by miners into a blocks. Then anyone can compute the current balance of inflows/outflows.

One of the main questions is how to create an origin inflow, which is analogous to block subsidy in Bitcoin. Several options are possible: miners will receive an inflow for some time after solving a block; ownership of units of other cryptocurrency can generate an inflow; a cryptocurrency having both flow and transactional money can allow the conversion.

It's possible to create a flow money cryptocurrency which will be complimentary to Bitcoin: a Bitcoin user willing to engage in it will lock his bitcoins in a transaction (e.g. using CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY), and will receive a proportional origin inflow proportional to the amount of bitcoins he have locked, which he then can use for tipping and whatnot. Eventually he will get his bitcoins back, at which point his flows will be considered defunct unless he freezes them again.
A client for such a cryptocurrency will need to follow both Bitcoin blockchain (to check that coins were properly frozen) and the flow money ledger (to compute current inflow/outflow balances, flow validity).",cryptocurrency,1436968991

Forex,Table of Economic Movements on FX,"Hi Guys,

Has anyone seen a table of different effects on FX depending on certain movements of economic and political events?

For example (and let's just use USD as an example although it'll be the same for all currencies -- pls note the BUY/SELLs may not be accurate....they're just place fillers):

| Currency:  USD | Moves Up   | Moves down     |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| Interest Rate        |          BUY |     SELL     
| GDP  |    BUY |  SELL   
| Employment       |        BUY |   SELL 
| etc.      |        etc. |   etc.

personalfinance,"What to do with current car, keep or buy another?","Hi r/personalfinance, I'm also posting this in r/cars to get input from enthusiasts.

My current situation is that my parents bought me a car out of college. It was very generous of them, they wanted to get me a low mileage reliable car, so last year we found a **2011 Civic with manual transmission and 26k miles.**

However my parents didn't have money to put down and, I'm assuming, not the best credit so we ended up paying ~275 per month for 72 months. and if you do the math that's about $7,500 in interest over the course of the payment.

Now at the time I didn't know too much about cars, and now I kid of wish I got a rwd car.

My mom also recently got a new-to-her car and her old **2001 Toyota Camry le v6 (with 190k miles)** has been sitting over the winter. It didnt pass inspection due to brakes, I think its all calipers and rotors that need to be done, but it may need some suspension work, and the frame is rusting a little but not too bad. This car probably had a few more years left.

&amp;nbsp;

My **expenses** are: rent (around 600), phone, utilities, and student loans (minimum payment is 300 but ive been doing 1000 every month), and I make 850 weekly after taxes. and have about 12k saved in the bank now.

So I have a few options at this point and I was wondering if you guys had any advice:

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 1:**
&amp;nbsp;

*Make additional payments to help parents pay it off quicker.

*Wait a few years for a more fun car (like a 2015 Mustang) or look for a 'cheap' Miata in the meantime

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 1.5**
&amp;nbsp;

*Re finance the loan to try and get a lower rate

*Wait a few years for a more fun car (like a 2015 Mustang) or look for a 'cheap' Miata in the meantime

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 2:**
&amp;nbsp;

*My dad will sell his 2009 Camry, take my Civic, and I would buy another car (something in the 15k range with around 50k-75k miles)

*Also repair the 2001 Camry and use that as a beater
 
 &amp;nbsp;

**Option 3:**
&amp;nbsp;

*My dad will sell his  09 Camry, and drive my Civic

*I will repair the 2001 Camry and drive that

*cons about this are the Camry is auto and doesn't have aux/anything like that

*pros is it would save the most money

&amp;nbsp;

Option 1 is my default plan or 1.5 if its at a much lower interest rate, is it extremely rare to not be able to refinance or pay auto loans off early? Option 2 would be nice but its a bit more risky than 1, and option 3... is well, lame from an enthusiast standpoint.

personalfinance,To Pay off Student Loans with Home Sale or a Home Equity Loan?,"I've been trying to create a budget for the next year, because I'm sick of living paycheck to paycheck and just barely getting by.

I make 50k a year, my boyfriend makes 40k. We have $0 in savings and investments. Its embarrassing, I know.

We have been together for over 6 years, own our home together, and do plan on getting married in the future (when we actually have some money).

I have massive student loan debt. To the tune of $800/mo (just paying minimums). On top of that we each have about $4000 in credit card debt.

We got lucky and bought our house at a great time. We paid 119, 115 is left, and it was last appraised at 160. This is before we finished the basement (adding about 800 sq ft). We are thinking about asking his parents for a 5k loan to finish the kitchen and bath (my boyfriend is a contractor and can do all the work himself, saving us a lot). This will hopefully boost the asking price to at least 170 - 180k.

Here is where our disagreement comes in. I want to sell, use half of the money we make from the house to pay off all of our debt except for my federal student loans. This will free up almost $1000/mo for us and still leave us with at least 15k in savings. I want to put that in a savings account, move to an apartment right next to my work, sell my car, and save, save, save. This gives us a year to rebuild credit, and by my estimates we could have $30k+ in savings after that 1 year. A pretty nice down payment for our next house. The problem - he refuses to live in an apartment. He considers himself a hobby mechanic (another thing we spend money on that we shouldn't) and absolutely refuses to move somewhere without a garage. The apartment I have my eye on does have underground parking and huge storage units (so he could store all his tools for $10/mo as well). But he just wont budge on it. Says he doesnt want people to be able to touch his motorcycle in shared parking. Doesnt want neighbors he can hear. And doesnt want to downsize. He thinks moving into an apartment would be a step backwards.

He wants to take out a Home Equity Loan to pay off our debt. I hate the idea of borrowing more to pay off debt. It would add about $200/mo to our mortgage and it has an interest rate of 8.5% for 30 years. 

And the compromise option... sell our house and buy another. Making a ~15k down payment with what is leftover after paying off the debts. The housing market is not what it was when we first bought our house. If we want to have the same payment we are going to have to move to either a bad neighborhood or a really dumpy house. The latter might not be so bad, because he has the skills to fix it up, but that is just more money to be spent. And we would have depleted all that we made on the sale with the debt payoff and downpayment. I worry that instead of saving that extra $1000/mo we will put a lot of that into new house and a lot less into savings. 

So my question to all you wise financial gurus... what is the best option here? Am I being unreasonable by not even considering taking out the Home Equity Loan? Is he being unreasonable by not even considering living in an apartment for a year? I feel like us being mildly uncomfortable for a year (I say us because I would have to make sacrifices too... like walking to work in the middle of a Minnesota winter) is a drop in the bucket for setting up a comfortable financial future for us. Or, is the compromise the best option? We'll save less, but we wont have to downsize and can keep our privacy. Thanks in advance for any advice!",finance,1436972102
investing,"Dear /r/investing, your destroying the markets.","Dear /r/ investing,

You're destroying the markets. 

We're in the 7th year of this bull market now and you are all still chugging away with your vanguard kool-aid, waiting to retire at 60 so you can yell at the kids running across your lawn. You're lazy, picking out passive investment funds solely for their low fees. You set aside a set % of your salary every month, sending it away to wall street where it can be pumped and dumped by institutional firms that care more about collecting their performance bonus and AUM rather than your dreams for a bigger house.

I know your happy with 4% a year, it adds up over time. Maybe in 20 years you can go on vacation for once on a yacht. You'll snap photos of some bullshit tourist vacation spot and pat yourself on the back for being disciplined all of these hard years. 

I bet you have heard startups are the big thing nowadays, but you probably don't know that small business creation is down. In fact, the number of small business in the USA has been declining for some time now. You may have had a friend or two who tried and failed, maybe they even asked you for funding? But who can take the risk on a company failing? That could set you back a few years of saving for your retirement/new house/other bullshit. Its better if the celebs on Shark Tank decide who get funding, what companies live and what companies die. They already have a few million in the bank, so what's loaning 10-25k here and there?

Instead, you read websites where they show that even if you started investing at the top every market for the past 30 years, you would still have a decent amount of money. Its probably better you take the safe route. Average returns for an average investment. 

The market will always go up in your mind. Even when its crashing, you're just telling yourself that its going to back up in a few years. Its just better to keep on buying and let the politics sort themselves out.

Life was tough a few years ago, the markets crashed, prices became affordable for once and volatility returned to normal levels, but when you have all of your eggs in 1 basket (or maybe 3 if you diversify between funds) you can't take that much of a hit on your portfolio. In fact, you probably applauded when the started QE. Don't worry they said! You've got the Fed on your side!  Yellen is there to make sure the price of your asset values never drop. God forbid we return to a normal volatility market and people actually have to perform rational fundamental analysis on stocks. So you keep putting in the hours and saving a few bucks every month and like a treadmill, the S&amp;P 500 has climbed ever higher, filled by your assets into outer space. 

Volatility? Whats that? BTFD! Greece? BTFD! China Tumbling? BTFD!

But what else can you do /r/investing? Saving money in a bank is about the worst idea in the world at the moment and you're desperate for those juicy gainz. Vanguards fees are low though, so just diversify through them. They know better.

Keep on praying to Yellen and the ZIRP gods, she'll keep your asset prices high. I'll stick to Zeus, pray for increased volatility and YOLO NBG. Hopefully he'll be pleased with my sacrificial lamb and chuck a few lightning bolts of disorder down from the skies.

personalfinance,Refinancing a Mortgage,"My wife and I purchased our house 3 years ago last month.  We got a $103,000 loan from the bank and put $40,000 down.

We did this coming straight out of college, and neither of us exactly had a credit score yet.  I know what you are thinking ""How did you get a bank to give you a loan with no credit score these days?  Did someone else sign with you?""  No.

We have a close tie with a local bank (my family invested in them when they started out and gave them the seed money they needed -- now they are flourishing in the tri-state area) and they basically gave us the loan on a 4.25% interest rate for a 15 year mortgage.

So -- right now we are paying a flat $1000 a month to pay it off, even though our payment is only needed to be $926 a month.  We obviously still have a long way to go...

But can someone please explain how the whole refinance thing works and if it is something that I should even be looking into?  Will doing a refinance bring down the interest rate, which would bring down the monthly amount we would be required to pay?  We would still pay $1000 a month, but I'm just wondering if it would help us pay it off quicker.

So, what would you do if you were me?

* 23-year-old woman, located in Pittsburgh, PA (shitty weather and roads)
* NO driver's license yet, will get it by the end of the summer
* looking to buy the car in March or April 2016
* FICO credit score of 755 according to Discover
* $2500 cash on hand saved for this purpose as of now
* income approx. $13,000/year before taxes through working, mostly during the summer; live off loans, savings, and part-time work during school year
* health professional student going on rotations to finish degree starting in May; this is what I need the car for. I consider this vehicle an educational expense, so I'm willing to use student loans to pay for part of it if necessary. I will graduate in May 2017 with around $130k student loans, almost entirely federal, having spent 7 years in school for a profession with around $90-100k expected earnings. 
* no familial help available; mom could maybe cosign a loan, maybe add me to her auto insurance? I have no idea how that works
* primary concern for the vehicle is reliability-- it absolutely must haul my ass from A to B every day. I don't care about looks, style, status, fun, etc. I must show up for rotations in order to graduate. The drive could be up to 45 mins-1 hour each way, depending on where exactly I get placed. 
* if I have to make payments, lower is obviously better, I guess under $200? I could take my money saved and split it up for payments. Same deal with insurance, but I know I'll probably get boned for being a new driver at any rate, and a financed car will carry higher insurance. I feel like I'd rather buy outright, but I'm worried that at my price point, I'll wind up with an unreliable money pit.

So for those who don't know. D.C. is covered with Capital One Bank ATMs. There is an ATM near my work, an actual branch by my apartment, and they even have ATM's in many subway stations.

My employer is a nonprofit and I am able to make the minimum payment for 10 years and the rest of the debt will be forgiven. I expect to pay around 120,000 over 10 years.

1. What kind of house can I afford? I have read that a mortgage of 2-2.5 times your annual income is reasonable but I'm not sure if this applies to me.  
2. Should I save up for a down payment or go ahead and take a professional mortgage loan? I am talking with a mortgage broker about this tomorrow and want to know what questions I should ask.

personalfinance,Starting grad school in a couple months - public (government) vs private loans,"Hi all,

My Master's degree will cost me about $110 K. I've already decided to attend (it's a highly ranked school in a really good program). I am wondering if anyone has any advice on whether to use public or private loans. 

My current financial aid offer for academic year:
Federal Perkins Loan - $8,000 at 5.0% fixed. No interest accrued while in school.
Fed Direct Unsubsidized Loan - $20,500 at 5.84% fixed.
Federal Direct Grad PLUS Loan - $50,316 at 6.84% fixed (unsubsidized).

I may be able to get a private loan through SunTrust at a fixed rate of ~4-5%. I have pretty good credit score (between 750 and 815) so I think my chances are pretty good.

The government loans sounds safe with a pretty good interest rate. Does anybody have any experience with private loans? Would appreciate advice on whether should just stick with gov loans or explore the private ones.

Thanks!!!",finance,1436994160

personalfinance,Advice needed to buy a house 100K-120k with a downpayment of 10K,"Hello everyone, 
I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to ask for advise for buying a house, will be my first home purchase. I don't know what to do since I have some questions regarding the process for the house downpayment. 

I'm considering getting a mortgage for house valued at 100K-120K and giving 10K as a downpayment. 

Here is my concern:

I just signed a new lease for a new apartment since I had to move 100 miles for work, same company though. Apartment company offered two options for security deposit regardless of your credit scores/history. 1st one pay a non-refundable $75 or 2nd pay $500 security deposit which will be refundable once I get out of there. I chose the second one to hopefully get the entire amount back.

I have decided to start the process of buying a house next month because why not. 

These are my finance figures so far:

Being in the company for 23 months. 

Single 28
Yearly salary $55,440. 
3000 monthly after taxes &amp; 401K (11%)
401K balance $14000
Yearly bonus paid in March: 5000
Gas &amp; internet is paid by company 
Cellphone $80
Car expense $312
Car insurance $80
Apartment rent $760
Apartment insurance $15
Electricity $30 ( I'm hardly in the apt)
Gym $30
Groceries $170 
Student loan $50 paid bimonthly from 2.5K financed for 7 years 
Credit card debt $2500, $6000 limit, pay $50 a month and when I get my bonus at the end of the year will pay all debt off 
I had another credit card 3000 in debt but paid it off 5 months ago, if it matters. Miscellaneous $300 (meds, family things, treat potential girlfriend to fun activities, restaurants, and other things)
Savings 2000 but I used $500 as a security deposit for new apt. 



So the question is, what should I do to come up with about 10% downpayment for a house valued around 100K-120K; 
10k-12k. 

From what I know I could open a Roth IRA and transfer 10K from my 401K (fidelity) and use it as a downpayment, this will be my first house so I'm thinking I wouldn't be hit with the 10% fee for withdrawing 401k funds before 59 1/2 

Or 

Should I be saving up more hard-earned money for the months to come to come up with more savings. This will take months if not years to come up with a substantial amount. 

If I'm able to get the 10K from my 401K I could do the following:

I'm using a simple mortgage calculator to find out the range of my monthly payments, 

120K mortgage 
Interest rate 3.92% according to google, (I know once I start the process the interest rate will vary given different factors that play across my finances). Monthly payments $883 

I could afford up close to 2K (this figure is adding back the apt rent expense) to my disposable income just in case the monthly payments of the given example of  $883 increases considerably depending of the factors at play. 

Do I have good possibilities of buying the house with 10K from the Roth IRA once I transfer it from the 401K, keeping in mind that now I have 1.5K after I paid 500 for security deposit (refundable). 

Any advise is appreciated.",finance,1436994655
personalfinance,I'm 21 and have close to $20k saved up. Is it better to pay off (most of) my student loans or invest &amp; make the minimum loan payments?,"Hello all,

I am 21 and currently attending college. I am majoring in chemical engineering (minor in astrophysics) and plan on graduating in December of 2016. I work a part time job making about $6-7k a year, most of which is spent on food, gas, bars, entertainment, etc. 

I'm fortunate enough to have a family that is helping me out with tuition &amp; housing, for now. I am personally borrowing $27k in the form of a Federal Unsubsidized Loan @ 4.29% interest (I believe it accrues at around 1% until 6 months after I graduate). In the past, my parents have set up a mutual fund for me which grew to $18k. They have since taken that money out of the mutual fund where it sits in a savings account. 

My main question is: should I save the $18k to pay off the majority of my loans upon graduating, or should I invest it? I was personally thinking of putting $10k into VTSAX and keeping the remaining $8k as an emergency fund. The only problem with that, is if I have a hard time getting a job upon graduating and am in need of that money, I could easily take a hit on it. 

Current assets: $18k savings, $1.8-2k checkings, car worth ~$6k (90,000 miles). 

With the current job market for chemical engineers, I'm not too hopeful in finding a job right out of school. If I am able to find a solid engineering job, I could probably pay $475-700 a month toward student loans, if not, I could only do $290-360 a month. Is paying 10-15% of income the way to go about that?  

Also, I know this is kind of along the guide lines of the ""I have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!"" but I know I am going to do 1 of 2 things with my money, I'm just not sure which, mathematically, is the better option. 

Any and all advice is welcomed. Thanks in advance!",finance,1436995034

personalfinance,Advice on a Dell order from hell?,"I didn't know where else to post this but this sub is so helpful with other people I figured I'd give it a go here.


A few weeks ago now I purchased a laptop from Dell through their small business department as I often do for my small business. They called me a few days later and said they didn't have the parts I ordered and that there would be a delay on the order as a result, but that's not important.


I got a call three days before the estimated delivery day and they (Dell) told me that they had tried to deliver the laptop but that my business was closed. I politely informed them that nobody had come and that we were open- in fact I was personally at the front desk when the delivery attempt ""failed"". They told me they'd try again the next day. 


You guessed it, 24 hours later and no laptop. I called them the next day and they told me that there was a hold on my account and that I was not going to get my laptop until I sorted the hold out with the Verification Department. Just for background it was the Customer Care department that told me this, and thereafter transferred me to Verification. Verification told me that they were unable to help as they were not the right department to amend the hold. ""Odd"", I told them, as I had just been told the opposite by Customer Care, who Verification was now insisting I be transferred to because it was their job to fix the hold. This happened, I shit you not, five times back and forth between the two departments (of course with wait times every time).


The next time I called I said I wanted to cancel the order, that I was fed up, etc. They told me I was not able to cancel my order due to the hold. I went through the same bounces between Customer Care and Verification, both of whom told me it was the other's job to fix, until I gave up. I called again a few days later... they told me the order was cancelled. Great! I asked about the nearly $3000 charge for the machine that was never delivered and they said it'd be refunded within 48 hours. Excellent!


Guess what? That's right. I got my credit card statement in today and nothing at all has been refunded and yet the charge for the order is right where it should be. Of course I called Dell straight away only to be told by Customer Care that they cannot refund my money until the hold is gone. Is that even legal? They transferred me to Verification and it's not even important at this point but that department was closed anyway.


Please help. Or tell me which other sub to go to (but beware you'd render yourselves as fickle as those damn Dell departments). I don't care at this point I just want my money back!

Our family is looking to buy a house but without much legal documentation. There are five of us, me, my wife, and our three children. Our youngest child is still in primary/elementary, our middle child is starting highschool and our oldest child is starting college, doing two years at a smaller nearby college then transfering to a larger more expencive school. We are looking to buy a house which is listed at $220000 (but maybe we could negotiate or something). We make approximately 75k a year and we have about 30k saved up. My credit score is somewhere around 700 last I checked and we should be able to get a mortgage from the bank but without much legal documentation it's hard. We have been in the states for 10+ years and have proof of work if that helps. Our son has federal aid that covers his entire first two semesters and our other son who will be in college soon is also smart and will probably get aid too, so while we would still like to have something saved up for when they go to bigger colleges, I don't think it will be too much of a problem. So basically I'm asking if any of you know what we can do, if there are any banks/buisnesses that would work with us. Some extra information we live in Virginia and I've done some online calculators and they estimate I could get a rate at about 4.25 and I would be ok with that, but I don't know if we could get that without documentation.

personalfinance,Put money in 401(k) or toward student loans?,"Hey there. So I'm just entering the ""real world"" after college and could use some advice. 


**Finances:**
My starting salary is $82k and I expect a raise in early 2016 of 3-6% and a second raise in summer 2016 of a similar percent. Net monthly pay is around $4500. I have a huge amount of student loan debt, well over $200k. Most is in my parents name as PLUS loans, and they work for the government so I will be making minimum payments based on their ICR for 10 years of PSLF, payments will be around $1600/month. I have just under $50k of student loans in my name, varying between 3-6% interest rates and am on the Standard Graduated repayment plan with initial payments of $316 maxing out around $1000. My bills/groceries/etc. are around $2000/month and my car is paid off. 

My first payments of my loans will be due in late December, so I am taking the $2k a month allocated for them to pay off some other debt (~$4000), purchase a modest used car for my SO (~$8000), and set aside some savings (~$6000). My SO is currently in school and will be working part time, probably not making more than $15-20k a year which will go toward his own bills and family commitments. Anything extra from his side will be ""fun money"" so as to not be entirely stingy and bored.

**Question:** I signed up for 4% of my paychecks to go to a 401(k) and 1% to purchase stocks. Would it make more sense to throw the ~$300 a month toward my student loans rather than saving it? I don't think that I will make more from the 401(k) interest (edit: forgot to mention that my employer matches 6% in a profitable year and 3% in a year that isnt profitable. There is a good track record of being profitable, but the industry has tanked recently and isnt showing signs of a full recovery in the foreseeable future) or the stocks (again, market I'm in is in the shitter, but it is a 10% discounted stock plan) than the interest that will be accruing on my loans - but I feel its just been drilled into my head that it is *so bad* to not save anything.

**Third:** FAFSA Loans (sub and unsub). Now these are confusing. These loans are all managed by Nelnet and the total amount is broken up into 10 different loans and those loans are split into 5 groups (A,B,C,D,E). Luckily none have acquired interest because they are FAFSA.

I've tried to compile as much relevant data as I could before I made this post. Essentially, my FACO/VantageScore scores are similar where available, but my FICO scores for TransUnion/Experian are noticeably higher than Equifax.

Now some background: I had/have two private Sallie Mae -&gt; Navient Loans, and 5 federal stafford loans, mix of sub/unsub. 3.5 years ago I fell very behind all seven loans. In early 2012 and again in 2013 I brought them to current with a forbearance and since early 2013 have been paying all of them on time. I was only able to pull Equifax and Experian from annualcreditreport.com today, however there is one thing that jumps out at me.

&amp;nbsp;

The federal loans, after I did a two year rehabilitation, were transferred to Nelnet. The Experian report shows all five (4 of which are currently closed) federal loans on Nelnet as pays as agreed. The federal dept. of education listings are gone. However, on the Equifax report, the same five show up for Nelnet under current/pays as agreed, but the five Dept. of Education loans are **still there** and show up, each, as 120+ days past due.

My gf has a jet blue amex since September 2014.  We lived in Jersey at the time.  There were a couple times where her card info somehow got stolen and they sent her new cards.  One happened to be right as we were moving this past April/May. She had them send the card to a different address as we had not yet found a new place.

The card was due to arrive right as we were leaving and she submitted a mail forwarding request at the post office. That didn't really matter because she was having it sent to her mother's address which was also the forwarding address.

They sent the card first to the previous address then to 2 wrong new addresses then finally got it right.  After she had been without the card for about a month for which they gave her 1500 JetBlue points.

We moved into our new place on June 1.  She called to update her mailing address and everything was great (or so we thought).  

We finally got some stuff in storage out and the apartment was a mess last weekend and she hasn't been able to find her card. 

Fast forward to tonight where she spoke with like 6 different representatives. One hung up on her, one told her she was to get it Friday another 2 transferred her to a ""specialist"".  When she got to the  ""specialist"", he asked her if she wanted to send the card to her mailing address which was the previous  mailing address which wasn't usable since don't live there anymore.  The specialist then proceeded to question her about who the landlord is and who she makes the rent checks out to.

They kept saying it was an unverifiable address despite it being recognized by USPS, UPS and FedEx for delivery of even large packages.  They said that since she couldn't give them a person's name(landlord), then they couldn't send the card.  The building is owned by her school and she told them this, yet they said they couldn't verify the info she was giving them.

I even called back as her like 5 mins later and despite telling the woman what had happened and telling her to transfer me to someone who could cancel the account since the card could never be sent, she proceeded to transfer me to the specialist.  It took about 40 mins to finally reach someone previously, so I hung up.

The corporate line is closed right now, so my gf will be calling in the morning.

Some stuff I write is to paint a bigger picture of the choices I've made, but are not strictly required for the financial advice I hope to receive from you all. Feel free to skim for the relevant information. I would love to hear how you guys think I should handle my student debt given my current and future professional/financial situation. 


I attended a private university and pursued English. First year, I only had to take 11,000 dollars out in private loans. The next year it literally doubled to 22,000. My university had decided to sharply decrease their aid. It never got better after that (final private loan was 25k). My mother handled my loans and never made a stink to the university about decreasing aid. Money is not a topic in my household, I was never taught personal finance by my parents, partly because they don't always practice the greatest finances themselves (they're lucky my dad is an electrical engineer who makes a comfortable six figures). I am one of 6 kids, so there was literally no chance of my parents ""helping me out,"" but my dad did co-sign all my loans. 


I did 4 years and a funded fifth year (through a selective program) at my undergraduate institution. After my fifth year, I decided to spend a year living with my boyfriend and working while applying to graduate schools. I applied to many jobs but heard back from only a few and mostly rejections (you know the drill). I ended up working mainly part time min wage gigs with one temporary/seasonal full time at a few dollars above minimum wage. I qualified for financial hardship for private loans and IBR for federal loans (which meant I paid 0 dollars a month for a year). 


I got into one graduate school for their doctoral program. Starting this fall I will be funded 20,400 a year. The program is estimated to take 6 to 7 years. I will need to begin repayment on my first private loan in 2017 (7 years after the initial loan disbursement). I don't know if I should try to budget and pay these loans, or save for them, or invest for them in the future. Do I begin repayment ASAP, even though the amounts would be meagerly? 


Here are some key details about my loans and my soon-to-be financial situation:

Current Total Principal of Private Student Loans: ~110k 
15k @ 5.69% variable (this would be the first loan due in two years, with a new private loan due each year after)
32,400 @ 10.44% variable (second loan)
30,400 @ 9.5% fixed (third loan)
31k @ 9.5% fixed (fourth loan)

Current Total Principal of Federal Loans: ~26k
10k @ fixed 6.8%
5k @ fixed 4.5%
11k @ fixed 3.4%

Soon-to-be Financial Situation
Graduate School Stipend: 20,400
Estimated annual stipend after taxes: 13,600 
Estimated monthly stipend: $1,511 

Monthly Expenses:
Housing: 780 + estimated 50 dollars on gas/electric = $830
Groceries: ~200 (could probably cut this down, just don't know yet)
Savings: ~300 (20% of monthly stipend because I have no emergency fund :/)


I am not paying for car insurance or cell phone bills (my parents are being generous about that, for the moment). I don't have any other debts as I don't own a credit card (should I?) and my car is a used piece of crap that cost me 2k (though she's trusty and reliable).


What complicates things is that there's no guarantee that after 6 or 7 years I'll get a decent-paying professor position. The market is pretty terrible for PhD graduates. I plan to diversify myself as much as possible during school, and I may decide to make the call to stop after my Masters (2 years) if I feel a doctorate program is not for me, or if I can get a job to pay of these loans, etc.. Housing is as cheap as it gets for a 1BR 1BA. Hopefully next year I can live with someone in the program and cut down on housing costs.

personalfinance,Starting a savings account for home down payment. Want to make sure I'm not missing anything.,"My wife and I want to start a savings account to build towards a down payment on a house. I'm thinking of using Ally bank because of their .99% APR. It probably won't gain me that much net interest but the psychological aspects is that we are separating this money from our checking account and we would leave the savings alone.

 I have considered a CD but it's possible that we would want to purchase before 2 years are up, and would not want to bother with the early withdrawal penalties. I'm not sure how much I would end up saving although I have cut frivolous expenses to nil. I am cutting out fast food (Was costing me $150/mo), won't be buying any more games (Steam library should suffice), and also have plenty of books. A World of Warcraft account x2 and Netflix ($39/month?) shouldn't be too bad.

Our combined income is about $106k (after Taxes it is about $65k). Have an existing mortgage which we do want to sell the house. We want to move from North Arkansas (super cheap) to the greater Portland area. Quite a bit more expensive but better schools, climate, more progressive culture, and things to do. Aside from the existing mortgage, we are still paying off our school loans. Mine is almost gone, and then we'll start putting extra money into hers. So aside from those 3 long term debts plus utilities/food, we live rather lean. 

I have been paying extra into my student loan account. From what I have read here, it would be smarter to pay that off faster rather than put into savings since the interest rate is 4.7% (ugh!) and obviously the interest rates on savings don't even come close to that. The interest rates on the other loans were higher, but my principal was significantly lower so we went for that one first. So should the focus still be on paying off existing debt while still building up some savings? We do want to sell our existing home obviously, we would be able to pocket a small amount of money from it at this point. 

So aside from setting up an account at Ally, are there additional aspects I should be aware of, or anything I am forgetting? Should I continue to focus on paying existing debts?",finance,1437026751

My husband has zero debt. I, however, have more than my fair share of debt between student loans, car payment, etc. We REALLY want to take advantage of this opportunity to eliminate as much of our debt as possible while simultaneously trying to save for a down payment on our future home. We're looking for advice on the best plan of attack. 

Here's the breakdown (excluding the rent, utilities, etc. we will not have shortly): 

**Credit cards:** 

• Value City CC: $500 ($25/month minimum payment), 0% interest if paid off by Jan 2016 

• All other credit cards are up to date and we NEVER purchase more than what we know we can pay off before interest kicks in. 



**Car:**

 • $4,700 ($304/month), 3.9% interest, 16 months of payments left  


**Student loans:**

• Federal loans: $28,600 ($333/month), varying interest rates because it's technically 6 loans in one, the highest is 6.8% and lowest is 3.4% 

• Private loans: $12,600 ($308/month), two loans at 7.5% and 9.25% interest 



**Other misc. expenses:** 

• Phones: $107 combined 

• Netflix: $8 

• Gym: $50 combined 

• Car insurance: $150 

• Gas: $120/month 

**Total expenses:** roughly $1,380

**Combined monthly income:** roughly $3400 take home 

We want to live there for about a year, pay off as much debt as possible, and simultaneously save for that down payment. I want a plan of attack. Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated!

1. Pay off short term debts including car and overdraft. Zero credit card. 
2. Save for emergency fund, additional retirements plans, vehicle maintenance buckets and dream buckets

My question is should I rather focus on one thing at a time, e.g. Paying off the overdraft? Currently I am building all buckets up in parallel and it is working really well. For example the fridge broke this month and the money for the repair came right out of the emergency fund bucket.

I'm trying to decide if I'd be better off changing banks as there seem to a be many offering relatively high interest rates.

So I worked out what my average daily balance has been over the last few months, and it's £835.

So if I'm doing things right, that £60 per year is the equivalent to getting 7.1% interest. So should I only change banks if another could offer better than that?

I am currently planning on taking out a variable rate private loan at 3-month LIBOR plus ~2.62%. 

I chose this because my federal option are ~7% fixed with an ~4% loan fee. While the federal loans have better deferment options I don't think it's worth the higher rate because 1.) my fiancé has steady work at about 60k/year, 2.) my job prospects coming out of the program are pretty good (100% placement last three years), and 3.) we have safety net options like parental assistance if things went really wrong.

My questions are: 
Am I crazy to go private? Everyone seems to say take federal first.

Is it stupid to take the variable rate? I know no one can predict the future, but I feel like rates will stay relatively low for the foreseeable future. The loan amount is also relatively low for what our combined income should be after I graduate, so we should be able to pay it off aggressively. Fixed rate for the private loan would be ~6%.

I am a contractor and my wife teaches private music lessons.  We live in the Bay Area, and housing is really expensive.  We got lucky and put a down-payment on a small house with our savings last year and now we are paying less than we were when we were renting.  We also had a baby last year and have a cat and a dog and want to have another child.  My wife has been at home for the past year taking care of the kid.  We thought we would be able to have her be a stay at home mom and just teach private on the side for fun, but the reality of that plan isn't working out.  

Would you guys be able to help me on fixing our budget?  I need some fresh perspective and ideas as I have been staring at the numbers and it feels like we aren't going to have enough if an emergency comes up unless we trim more, or my wife stops teaching and works full time instead of teaching and taking care of our child (both of which she loves).  I want to be able to support her but the numbers don't lie.  And if she went to work full time, she would probably only bring in $15 an hour, which would be $30k income, but most of that would go towards the cost of daycare.

Right now we can't take a vacation unless I get another job on the weekends, or find a new line of work.  I don't even have a budget in there for new work clothes, or baby clothes at the moment.  If we cut all of the Discretionary Spending, that will save $302.08, but we use all of the things there all of the time.  It just seems a bit nuts that it is costing us $56,880 for just living.

Any input and ideas on what to trim, optimizations, or suggestions are welcome.  Thank you!

personalfinance,Trying to consolidate credit card loans and fin. asst. said I could transfer some to personal loan. Any downsides?,"Here's the skinny:
I have approximately $7,700 in CC debt
$1,200 in a USAA Card / $1500 limit
$6,500 in a CapitalOne Card / $6,500

In October my student loan debt will finish consolidation and I will be paying about $170/mo (@6.00% interest) on one full loan instead of $400/mo on about 12 smaller loans with varying interest rates (between 4 - 8%)
This will free up about $230 that I can spend on debts

This month I talked to PNC Bank and they suggested that I get a CC with them at 0% interest and a $2,500 credit limit. 
I finally got the card last week and now me and the ""personal banker"" at PNC that helped secure the card are trying to figure out how best to pay down on the loans. He told me the following (via email) and I've pasted his information below:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;The best approach for this right now I believe is to pay off the USAA card in full. (Via Balance Transfer.)  Then we have enough room to transfer $1,042 from the CapitalOne card.  We could do a personal loan at a much lower rate for the remaining $5500.00  Your rate would be as low as 9.65%  We could do any term between 6-60mos..  To give you an idea I listed payments below on that personal loan. 

&gt;* **This interest rate is quoted at the as low as rate.  Which means it could potentially be a little higher depending on your credit report/score. ** *

&gt;*@9.65% for 24mos.- $253
&gt;*@9.65% for 30mos. -$207
&gt;*@9.65% for 36/mos.-$177 

&gt;Our loan terms for this loan run anywhere from 6-60mos.  This rate is going to be roughly 8-10% lower than the current CapitalOne rate, which will help you pay this balance off faster and in a certain time frame.  You can also make extra payments on it as well to pay it down quicker if you are comfortable doing so. There are no pre-payment penalties.   

&gt;We could also stretch that loan out to 60/mos. which would put your payment right around $116/mo.  Then once you consolidate those other loans you can make additional principle payments on this loan and get it paid off a lot faster with less interest paid that you would on that credit card.. 

&gt;The process of moving it over to a personal loan is quick and easy.  
&gt;That promotion rate is something we can apply in the first 90 days of the card opening and then that rate is good for 12 months.  
&gt;I would suggest doing the personal loan of $5500 for a few different reasons.  
&gt;*1) It will raise your credit score because your revolving debt will be lowered. 

&gt;*2) Since you initially have 90 days to do that balance transfer to get that rate those first two payments won't make much room for another balance transfer yet.  Maybe a few hundred dollars.  

&gt;*3) You know that time frame you are going to be debt free with that personal loan and like I said you can make extra principle payments so you pay a lot less on interest. 

&gt;*4) It is possible  if you pay down that PNC card quickly that they could potentially send you balance transfer checks in the mail and continue that promotion for you.  In which you can use that to pay towards the personal loan line and transfer some of that balance.  The personal loan could be a beneficial tool for a few reasons in your situation. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

personalfinance,My interest rates got almost cut in half with no notice?,"I mean.. I'm clearly not upset. I'm more so just confused as I didn't know this could happen.

In December of 2013 I moved a personal loan and an auto loan from my bank to a credit union. The personal loan was about 13k and the car loan was about 5k. 

I've been putting between 450-500 onto the loans every month, making the minimum payment on the personal loan and putting all extra on the auto loan to get it paid off quicker. 

Today, I noticed that the amount of my payment going towards interest on both loans was almost cut in half. From about $17 down to $9 on my auto loan, and $73 down to $45 on my personal loan.

Anyone know how or why this happened?",finance,1437069662
personalfinance,Did I make the right suggestion?,"Hello,

Recently my girlfriend got an auto loan and was given two choices. The two loans were the following:



Loan Amount | APR | Loan Term | Monthly Payment
---|---|----|----
$15,325.95 | 7.99% | 60 Months | $210
$15,725.95 | 5,99% | 72 Months | $178

She asked me for advice and I suggested the second loan because even though it was $400 more, I figured that she would pay less interest because of the lower interest rate.

For context, the first one is $400 cheaper because Hyundai gives a $400 bonus for college grads but that is why the interest rate is higher.

Was I correct in suggesting the second loan?

I couldn't find any information on how to calculate and see which loan is better when they are for different lengths.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Is selling stock to pay off student loans wise?,"Hi all, 
I graduated last year with about $50,000 in student debt and have about $40,000 left with them at an interest rate of 6.8% (government loans). I pay $1000 a month to them every month and have made a dent, but I'm on track to pay them off in about 4 years, or possibly sooner as soon as my fiance graduates and works full time. I am currently maxing out my 401k and have been trying to put money into savings over paying the loans back super aggressively.

Shortly after graduating, I began working at a tech company in the bay area and was generously awarded with stocks that are vesting this month (after a year). At the price of our current stock, if I sold all of my stock units that are vesting, I would be able to almost completely pay off these loans. The stock that's vesting is about a quarter of what they gave me, which vests over the next 3 years in small percentages, so I wouldn't be selling all on my investments, but a significant portion of them (the largest chunk I will get).

As a new grad and someone who hasn't had money to manage before, I was wondering if it would be smarter to either hold onto the stocks or sell them and invest in something long-term and low-risk or pay off those nasty 6.8% loans and be debt free. 

I would love to get rid of my debt so I can start saving that money to save for a house in the next 5 years. We would still have my fiance's student loan debt to pay, however, but it would cut our debt in half in one fell swoop.

My inclination is that although the stock will likely stay strong, I would like to avoid paying tons of interest on these loans and should eliminate them in favor of becoming debt free.

What would you all suggest?

personalfinance,Question about investing in a 401(k) with no matching or just buying some three-fund portfolio/index funds myself,"Currently I have no debt and plan to max contribute to my roth IRA so those are taken care of. According to the wiki it seems that the 401k is better to invest in before going ahead and buying stocks/bonds/treasuries or whatnot that I'd manage myself.

I have access to a TSP which main benefit for me is the crazy low expense ratio but I just had a few questions if anyone knew the answers to them:

1. Roth TSP follows similar principle to Roth IRA? As in you want to go with Roth over traditional if you expect a higher future tax amount (Either taxes go up or you are a higher earning bracket), currently I am planning on a Roth TSP.

2. The big difference between me putting money into a TSP and buying stocks/bonds/whatnot through it rather than simply buying that stuff with my own money and handling it through Vanguard or on my own is:

* TSP has expense ratio that I might not have if I just have the stocks/bonds myself

* TSP is tax advantaged so even though I pay the (Low) ratio, it's still a much better long term idea

* I can pull out the money that I invest myself at almost any time without much consequence while TSP would get hit with fees and bills and stuff

Does this seem accurate?

3. What is a reasonable amount of money to contribute to the TSP? Obviously if I were a federal employee I'd match the contribution (Which is 5%) but since I'm not and just plan to use it for the low ratio and in the future move that money to my Roth IRA/new 401k if permitted I'm not really sure what people would consider a decent amount to put into it. I can safely go up to ~15% but I was thinking that 5% would be more reasonable since the TSP wouldn't have nearly enough time (5 years) to really make use of that additional money. 

Ultimately I'm trying to decide if it's a good idea for me to invest the money into the long term TSP with the idea of rolling it over at some point before retirement, or to just do general investing.",finance,1437083016
personalfinance,Bought home at $130k 2 years ago. Just appraised at $230k. What should I do?,"What's up guys?

Been debating on whether or not I should put my home up for sale, here's the story.

May of 2013, Denver Colorado, we bought a HUD home (1,100 sqft, 3 beds, 1 bath) at 130k.  Took out an FHA loan and put an additional 35k into it.  Replaced entire plumbing and electrical.  Refinished hardwood floors and completely renovated bath and kitchen.  I saved a shit ton of money on contractor costs as I did all the finishing.  Paint, trim, etc.. myself.
 
Late 2014, we thought we'd have enough equity in the home to get out of mortgage insurance.  Sure enough, the appraisal came back and we were sitting on a $230k house.  I was like sweet!!!

Anyway, the way the market is going right now I am confident i could put this guy up on the market and push 260-280 for it.  Obviously the bank won't finance it if an appraisal comes in below that, but people are paying straight cash for homes in Denver right now.

So what do I do?  

1.) Sell the home, take out the cash, use it as a down payment for another home? (Concerned I won't be able to find one at such a good value).
2.) Sell the home, save the cash, rent an apartment and wait for the market to cool down and buy another home?
3.) Don't sell the home, make more money, buy another home, and rent this one?

On a side note.  Finances.  Wife is sitting on a 10k auto loan, I've got about 40k in Federal Student Loans with about 6k left on auto loan.

finance,100 Years of Credit Unions,"The first U.S. credit union opened in 1909. From the beginning, credit unions followed a unique concept. They were created not for profit, but to serve members as credit cooperatives. Since then, over 100 years have passed, and there are 6,557 credit unions in the United States serving over 102 million members. Oak Tree wants to celebrate the 100+ years of credit union history by looking back at how credit unions were started.
 
The creation of credit unions is credited to Friedrich Wilheim Raiffeisen, the major of a small German town whose residents were struggling financially. His idea was to create a small pool of the community’s money that would allow the residents to get small loans at a low interest rate. This idea later spread to other countries expanding throughout Europe, India, and making its way to Canada in 1901. Credit unions later expanded into the United States in 1909, with the first credit union opening in New Hampshire. This same year, Massachusetts passes the first state credit union law, which is the Massachusetts Credit Union Act.
 
In the 1920s, credit unions gained popularity in the U.S. as demand for loans grew when people sought loans to buy cars and large household appliances. Credit unions saw a large need in the market for low-interest loans, so they began promoting credit unions to the public and soon after Massachusetts opened up 19 new credit unions. By seeing what a great demand there was for credit unions in the market, philanthropist Edward Filene “organized and Roy Bergengren managed a national association—the Credit Union National Extension Bureau—to promote the establishment of credit unions throughout the United States” (NCUA).
 
In 1934 President Roosevelt passed The Federal Credit Union Act. Growth for credit unions was steady during the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s. In 1970, the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund allowed  federal deposit insurance to be extended to credit unions. Also, in 1970, the NCUA was founded to regulate over credit unions. In 1977, more laws were passed that allow credit unions to offer more services to their members. The ’70s was an extraordinary decade for credit unions, as they nearly doubled the number of credit union members during that period of time.
 
The 1980s showed hard times in the United States with double-digit inflation, a recession, and high interest rates, but credit unions still continued to grow. Assets grew steadily despite the fact that the number of credit unions dropped due to mergers.
 
The 1990s brought more changes to credit unions with the Membership Access Act and the signing of the Credit Union Membership Access Act by President Clinton in 1998. In 2008, credit unions endured the 2008 recession and by 2014 there were over 100 million credit union members in the United States. Today credit unions remain strong and follow the same philosophy that they were founded on over 100 years ago. The distinguishing features include:
Democratic governance
Each member has one vote, regardless of the size of the member’s deposits
Member-elected board of directors
Volunteer based
Oak Tree is passionate about the credit union movement and has also reached an important milestone. Founded in 1980, seven of Oak Tree’s employees have been dedicated to Oak Tree and its mission by serving credit unions for over 10 years. An additional five have been with the company for over 15 years. Combined, Oak Tree has over 100+ years of knowledge and experience that has led to indisputable expertise.",finance,1437091036

personalfinance,Need PF's take: Paying down debt on depreciating personal use asset (Car loan) vs. Student Loans,"Hi all, 


I deeply appreciate and respect the contributions of the PF community. That's why, today, I'm looking for your advice and insight on paying down debt on a car loan vs. student loans. Also, if you see anything I haven't outlined, I'd really appreciate it.

**Background**: I understand, when applying surplus funds, the general principle of paying down higher interest rate loans first. I also plan on paying any sub 3% interest rate loan on a monthly basis, as it's likely less than average inflation rates. Additionally, I understand and adhere to the ""emergency fund"" rules of thumb. This request is only for applying payment strategies, not budgeting principles (though that too, admittedly, could use some refining - but that's for another day).

**The good news**: Recently, using a lump sum bonus from my employer, I was able to pay off a $5,000 private student loan @ 7%. Using the ""snowball effect,"" I plan on using the additional monthly surplus to apply to other loans. My company has separately determined, yet bi-annual bonuses that are all but garaunteed. Aside from the additional monthly income I have from paying off my private student loan, I plan on using at least a significant portion of these bonuses toward paying down my debt.

**The question(s)?**: Which loan(s) do I pay down first? Do I focus on higher interest rate loans first? Or, do I factor in depreciating assets (car loan) against strictly interest rates alone?


**The facts**: 

*Car loan*: 2004 4dr sedan. Private party Kelley blue book: $4,640

Remaining balance - interest rate
$6,317.97 - 4.9%


*Student Loans*

Remaining balance - interest rate

This is clearly stating in the future they are planning on decreasing the interest rate to 16.99%? [Currently it sits at 19.99%](https://customer.ctfs.com/Products/CreditCards/OptionsMasterCard/OptionsMasterCardApply/).

If this is true, I'm kicking myself for not accepting the credit limit increase they offered me a year ago. My line is only $500 and I read some bullshit on reddit about keeping your first line of credit's limit low and using it and immediately paying it off to have an extended flawless credit history on your oldest card and never close it. Does this even have merit?

I have an 80% filled CC with a 5k limit. I always thought your total debt/equity mattered for all of your cards, not just each one, and never bothered leaving debt on my other cards for this reason.... Clearly I'm an idiot and am trying to crawl out from this mess.",finance,1437093439

Planning on the optimal way to keep my ship afloat while I focus on this with the least damage in the long term (Canada)","Currently I am receiving assistance with rent, car payments and tuition via family and student loans. For the sake of my planning I am not currently focussed on my student loans. I will save this for when I am gainfully employed as they are currently in interest-free status while I am enrolled.

Some damage is going to be necessary for my current plan. I am looking to minimize my damage while focussing on what matters right now. (24/m/Canada)

That being said here are the expenses I am responsible for:

Groceries/supplies/general expenses
Car Insurance
Gas &amp; Car maintenance
Gym &amp; Health

I use Mint.com and it is clear that 85% of my monthly expenses are:

insurance: $300 

gas: $100-$200 (2-4 tanks of gas in Canada a month)

Groceries/fastfood/supplements/toiletries: $250

Gym: $56

Recreation: 0-$200+ a month (currently frugal, won't be when I am networking among my field in the fall) 

Misc: Just cleaned up all the body work on my car with some birthday money. Purchased all of my school supplies and expensive supplements for the next year... Clothes are needed.

You get the picture. I'm spending more than I'm making while not doing much. I can be more frugal and that's my goal.


Income: Depends on shifts I can get with an experiential marketing firm and freelance work I do related to my field. Usually less than $1000 a month and definitely will be once school is back in session. Likely &gt;$500 a month unless I pursue UberX like I've been eyeing.

Cash: $1500 in bank for Gym Payments, Insurance Payments and CC payments in the long run.

**Now the reason I posted.** I have 4k in CC debt. Unfortunately I didn't understand credit cards well enough and thought that me having several lines of credit was counting in favor of my debt vs equity. 

I have 4k all on one CC, the Amazon Chase Canada card @ 19.99% and did not bother to accept the increase on my other Canadian Tire Financial Services card at 13.99%

Current Credit Lines:

Amazon Chase Canada, $4000/$5000 @ **19.99%**

CTFS $0/$500 @ **13.99%**

HBC Financial $0/$1200 @ **29.99%**


~~(Student Loan)~~

(Car Payment is not under my name)


Cash: $1500

Asset: $10,000 car nearly paid off (family gift sort of, I did the down payment $5k)

Now my very limited understanding in the short term and long term should be this. I am looking for assistance in evaluating my strategy.

**Short term**: Stay in and remain frugal and increase debt slightly on CTFS to 30% of $500 (lol) rather than increasing Amazon Chase more than necessary. I called CTFS and they would not increase my limit. Should I not make the CTFS credit history ugly for $200? Should I open another card elsewhere? I am also going to look in to a better insurance rate now that I have a bachelor's degree, apparently banks care about that. Everyone keeps telling me mines insane (its been going down slightly..)

Sidenote: I read online a long time that you should keep your first CC a free CC and squeeky clean with a low limit that you use regularly and pay off for a good credit history in the future. My CTFS card is my first card. Is there any merit to this strategy? I'm assuming its BS if I'm just blowing up another card anyways.

**Long term**: my understanding that a long term strategy would be to open a line of credit. I don't think any bank would offer me one. What is a more viable long term strategy? 

My bank has offered me a not-so-low (13% if I recall) interest rate card with free transfers for a period but with only a 1k CC limit. I considered this method but am not quick to opening more credit lines until I am sure it is an optimal solution for the long run. 

Basically, debt is a necessity as I enter into an ultra competitive final year of school. Financial freedom is not my current goal. One year of crushing shit in my field, with debt, is my goal. I will be living close to campus. I am already looking at using their gym instead (for free/included) if it is good. 

What lines should I close? What, if anything, should I look in to opening?

personalfinance,My banker friend is advising me to refinance my 15 year mortgage into a 30,"I called a friend of mine who works at a credit union to get some info about applying for a HELOC to pay off our high interest student loans. He's advising me to refinance my 15 year 3.5% mortgage to a 30 year 5.5% mortgage. Once we roll our high interest student loans into the mortgage, the new payment will be lower than what we are currently paying. Since we plan on hopefully upgrading to a nicer house in about 7-10 years, he said there's no point in paying off the house in 15 years. In his words, ""you'll get a lower monthly payment AND a lower interest rate on your student loans, win win.""

Under the terms he's offered, we will pay about $180k in interest over 30 years (student loans included) but only $45k in interest with our current mortgage. 

We currently owe $152,000 on the house and in October it was appraised for $180,000. Student loans are $20k @ 9% and will be paid off in 7 years, we'll pay about $7k in interest overall.

I'm more so curious how someone in my position would handle their finances. After being super broke in NYC during the recession, I learned that I have no one else to depend on and started to live a lot more frugally and stash my cash in the bank just in case.  Some say my ""emergency fund"" is too large and I should do something else with it. What are you thoughts?

Background Info:
I currently have $17k in cash that just sits in a savings account. It earns something ridiculous like .05% interest, but I like the sense of security that it gives me to have it readily available. I make $40k/year and 5% goes to 401k pretax ($6k vested!)

I have $29k in student loans and the grace period ends in September. I have covered the interest monthly and made extra payments, when possible (about $400/month for the past 8 months or so). The interest rates vary from 3.5% to 6.8% (weighted average about 4.4%).  I expect the monthly payment to be $330. I could put an extra $170/month towards it, but that would mean no deposits to my savings account.

I'd also like to have dental implant surgery. I was born without 2 teeth in the front of my mouth and absolutely hate worrying about the partial that I wear daily.  I haven't done it yet because I can't seem to part with the $6k that it will cost. Insurance does not cover any of it.

dogecoin,Dogecoin Lending,"#If we're going to get a proper Dogeconomy going, we need more than just tipping and buying doge trinkets.

Like working for Doge, which /u/GoodShibe has been pushing passionately for a while now.

And financial services. Like Bitcoin has had for a while now.

Now, I'm not suggesting we can become a hub for billions of dollars of investment. For starters, we don't have the market cap, and we probably don't have the mindset either.

But there are times when shibes need a hand with their finances. It may be an unexpected expense. It may be well-laid plans going sour. It may even be mistakes made in the BTC-lending community.

#Borrowing is an expensive business

Leaving aside the real world, where banks and other lenders want you to jump all sorts of hurdles, hand over your first-born and all... In the cryptosphere, the only game in town is BTC, and the so-called lenders are all really middlemen who charge some pretty hefty fees for no risk to themselves, while leaving both borrowers and lenders exposed.

#We can do better

What we excel at is community, right? And isn't helping people in our DNA? Heck, we even helped out victims of MtGox, who had nothing to do with Dogecoin, remember?

We're happy to throw doge at strangers for all sorts of reasons, from the heartwarming to the downright absurd.. CliffHorse? DogeParty? Srsly? :(

Well, why not throw a few doge into a fund to help out shibes in need?

#A mechanism already exists for this

Over on /r/AsicGroupBuy *(or /r/AGB which redirects)* we set up a mining pool to distribute earnings in both Doge and BTC. It doesn't mine, but it does do a very good job of doing all the necessary accounting for projects.

And in case you haven't noticed, mining is pretty well dead. Our days of actually hosting our own ASICs are gone, and thanks to the many cloud scams, so are our group buys of hosted mining. We're a community with no real purpose right now.

Which leaves us ripe for a re-tasking, I think.

Now, there are existing subs, such s /r/borrow for example. But they're fiat-based, and in my view somewhat riskier than we'd like.

What I have in mind is that shibes needing to borrow would verify their identities with the mods, and possibly meet with other local shibe(s) if feasible. Amounts would be small, purposes would be realistic ***(no speculative 'investments', no impossible or frivolous goals)***, relatively short-term, and repayment plans would be clearly defined.

The beauty of the existing infrastructure is that a hundred lenders could each chip in a handful of doge, and the borrower could make payments at the agreed rate, which would then automatically be apportioned to the lenders.

#This would keep risk low.

Now, I just helped an AGB member out who got into trouble with BTC loans. I'm not going to name him, but I know who he is, and his real-world situation. He simply ran into a perfect storm of scammers, soured investments and external circumstances which left him unable to meet his commitments. Refinancing on the commercial sites would have cost him 200%, so we worked out another approach. A couple of existing AGB members sniffed around the deal, but time was short, so I just threw 5 million at him to get it done, for a 5% return.

This is **not** how it should work. The key to any investment plan, no matter which side of it you're on, is diversification. Never put all your eggs in one basket. A hundred lenders at 50k doge each is much better than one at 5m. Conversely, lending 50k each to a hundred different shibes is safer than lending on just one big loan as well.

That way even if something goes wrong, the damage is contained.

hardware,Is HBM a plausible solution for laptops and consoles?,"When I say ""solution"" I'm referring to the idea of a possible/potential alternative to current options. I'm not inferring that there's a current problem to what we already have.

I've read up a bit on HBM but I'm not understand in-depth as to *all* benefits it provides over GDD5. I understand that it frees up some surface area and the high bandwidth allows more data to be fed in and computed in a given space of time with the GPU operating at a much lower frequency rate.

To me, with what little unique testing specs I've been able to research, it would sound as though HBM would be a good solution for ultrabooks/gaming laptops as well as console platforms. The smaller surface area could mean more space for other hardware when integrated into a motherboard. The higher bandwidth but lower clock speed sounds like the GPU would require less power to get more done. With less power consumption it would seemingly infer that the GPU would generate less heat or less surface area results in faster cooling times. (I'm unsure of how many stream processors would be required though to outpace a GDDR5 GPU.)

So here are the fine points I'd like to discuss and be educated on:

* Would an integrated HBM GPU be freeing up more space than a GDDR5 GPU?
 * Would an Ultrabook be able to use it without adding more thickness? (Is stacked die height a critical concern?)

* Is the higher HBM bandwidth possible at modern mobile GPU sizes?

* Would a GeForce GTX 900m family-alternative HBM GPU consume less power to match or exceed their GDDR5 performance?
 * Would it be easier to cool?
* If companies integrated a mobile chipset HBM GPU in a current ""Next-Gen"" console would the motherboard be able to keep the same amount of RAM, hence allocating more memory to the system?
 
^(*Note: On this last one, I'm not suggesting that they replace the current lineups from here on out. I'm asking about spacing because I'm not familiar with how things measure up with integrating it into a MOBO. /u/plank_ has pointed out that integrating a GPU would take up more space since current consoles use APUs*)

I'm only considering it to increase my debt ratio and overall available credit.

So all that being said, should I take the offer or ignore it? Which would be more beneficial to my credit score?

Edit: the CC is being offered by First National (not Premiere). It's a VISA Legacy Credit Card. Here is a little overview of it from a CC blog. http://creditcardforum.com/blog/legacy-credit-card/
It doesn't appear that there are any startup fees. Using it to pay a monthly bill or two seems like a good idea. I'm mostly worried about the effect of another hard inquiry on my account. I've got a decent amount of CC debt that I'm working hard to pay off and am doing a good job at slowly paying each card off. So my main question is: will the hard inquiry hurt me more than paying the CC off monthly would help me?

Edit 2: Thanks for the input, everyone! After researching this bank some more, I've decided to not accept it. I'll just wait to get a better card when my score improves.",finance,1437141364

personalfinance,Sorry if wrong sub. Car dealer called and wants to renegotiate my contract.,"Some info, I bought a car on Monday from a national chain dealership. Wasn't the best deal but it was my first car and I have terrible credit. Well, yesterday I received a call from my dealer saying he wants to save me money by getting me to sign a new contract. Obvious fed flag right? The best I can surmise is that he sold me on a contract that wasn't approved yet by the bank. And now wants to get me to sign on new terms. Obviously I have a binding legal contract so I assume I don't have to agree to the new terms. Is this common? What do I do? Do I have any leverage in this situation? Sorry if this is difficult to understand, I am on mobile and not very poetic when it comes to words.

UPDATE: So I went in to hear them out, when I walked into the office the gentleman had a contract printed and ready to sign. I asked why do I need a new contract, he again told me because he wants to save me money. At that point I said I'm not interested in renegotiating and that I wanted to unwind the deal. He immediately closed his folder and said he would have to talk to supervisor. He left me in the office, so I left and went back to reception. 30 minutes later I am pulled aside by a salesman who told me to just save the money. I had never met this salesman and as far as I'm concerned he had no idea about my agreement. I told him I'd talk to the boss. 10 minutes later the boss comes out, piercing eyes and all. We sit down and again I ask why the new contract. He says literally out of the kindness of their hearts. So I have him print the new contract, I also tell him to provide a copy of the old one. I then tell him I'll be taking both to the reception area to review and make a couple phone calls. He says I can only see them in his office. I tell him that isn't true and that I'll be taking the contracts. He then folds up the copy of the original and says its his and I can't use it, so I grab the new draft and tell him that I'll take it home and be in contact shortly. He says I can't take it because it's a legal binding contract. Without signatures it holds no ground I tell him, at this point he says if I walk out he will force the original contract to stand. So I was tired of the bullshit, I grabbed the new draft and walked away while he was demanding I give it back. 

TBH I got kinda pissed off at this guy. Maybe I didn't handle it well but it felt good to let these guys know that I wasn't gonna be their bitch. For whatever reason they don't want the original contract to stand. Their behavior seems to indicate a fuck up on their end. Considering hiring an attorney.

TL;DR They gave me the run around so I walked out with a copy of the new contract to be analyzed by an attorney.",finance,1437145763
personalfinance,"Looking to make a career change, and need to take out significant loans to make it happen (also already have significant debt)","Let me start off by getting this out there: I'm 26 years old, I have no financial bearings, and have done no financial planning heretofore in my life. What you're about to read is a basically a train wreck, but it's hopefully a rough patch in what will be a bright, stable financial future. I'm committed to getting my life together at this point. 

**I'm currently unemployed.** People scoff and say that I should have lined something up before resigning from my last job, and while I would generally agree, my boss was extremely abusive. That sounds like bullshit, but I wasn't the only one to quit, and he made his partner break down into tears at least once a week. He was a lunatic ass hole.

I was also salaried, and working 50-60 hrs each week made it very difficult to find new employment. So after a year, I'd gotten to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't the most prudent decision, but it was one I was willing to risk. Since then, I've been working here and there on websites for small businesses to scrape by. It's pathetic, but after paying this month's bills, I have about $700 to my name. 

**My current expenses:**

$162/mo car payment

$91/mo private student loan (minimum payment)

$100/mo car insurance payment

I moved back in with my mother, so I don't have any utilities, rent, etc. She also fortunately pays for my phone bill. 

**My current debt:** 

My debt from undergrad is pretty monstrous. I have about $35,000 in subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans, but fortunately I'm eligible for income-based repayment, and have a monthly payment of $0.00 for those loans. 

I also have a $5,000 loan from a national bank, which accounts for the $91/mo I have to pay. It's got an insane interest rate--around 12%, give or take--and it's accruing interest like crazy. And of course, about 1% of the minimum payment goes toward the principal, so I'm not making any progress on it at the moment. 

That said, I have a relatively good credit score (~700).

**The Plan**

I've been accepted to a 3-month intensive program that teaches Rails engineering. I've been interested in software engineering for some time, and I did quite a bit of research looking for a program that would give me both the skills and connections I'd need to get a job quickly after finishing it. 

They tout that 95% of their attendees get a job within one month of completing the program. I was naturally dubious of this, but I happen to know 4 other people who have finished the program, and each has landed a job with a starting wage of at least $30/hr since (though two of the four are making $40/hr). 

The program also has a ~15% focus on resume-building, interview preparation, etc., and they provide a number of opportunities to build connections with local tech professionals. They even get us in contact with a number of recruiters (headhunters) who serve corporate groups like Cox Media who are in the area.

**Here's the rub:**

The program starts in late September, and costs $12,000. Fortunately, they've partnered with an awesome tech-incubator/lender that covers the tuition for 99% of applicants. Based on their minimum credit requirements, it shouldn't be any problem getting that loan. They also offer a three-month grace period after graduating that only requires you pay between $25 and $50/mo. 

The real problem, and where my main concerns stem from, is being able to find the money I'll need to live without working for three months. My current expenses, in conjunction with rent, utilities, food, gas, and a $1000 deposit the program requires upfront, will end up costing me between $7000 and $8000 for the three months. 

Naturally, my first instinct would be to get a part-time job while I was there to help cover expenses. The program, however, is intensive as fuck, and their reps (and the people I know who've done it) told me to expect to put in between 60 and 80 hours each week. With that in mind, even a part-time job really isn't an option.

**My questions:**

1. What is my best course of action for a lender? I've been looking into loans for continuing education, but most only provide loans for students attending institutions that offer formal degrees. Those that do offer ""personal"" loans have sky-high interest rates and I'd have to start repaying them immediately. 

2. Am I insane? Part of me thinks that I should defer enrollment and just try to save up for a year or so, but I'm afraid I'll be stuck treading water again and will be in the same (or similar) position then too.

Unfortunately one of the only places to offer what I'm looking to learn isn't considered as a school by the government because they have less holidays than most university’s there so that they can pack more learning into the year.

personalfinance,Secured credit card confusion? I have a bad FICO score and want to improve my credit,"So the last FICO score notice I got was about 580.

I have no real credit history aside from federal student loans, which are currently deferred. I took out my very first auto loan (about $10,000) just a few months ago and was amazed I even was able to finance a vehicle. I've also taken out a very small loan (they only approved me for $150) from Sun Loan and they report to the credit bureaus too. But this is all I have to go on and it's all very recent.

I've never had a large loan before and I have certainly never had a credit card. I want to try using credit cards to help me improve my credit and help me get ahead on my bills because I am currently drowning with late utility bills, rent, owing friends/family money,  and paying off my car loan. It was a mistake to get a car loan I know, but I was in danger of losing my job without a car. I only get about $18,000 in yearly income from my job.

Anyway I was thinking about secured credit cards as a way of helping boost my score and build credit history. Was looking at this:  http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/nerdwallets-best-credit-cards-for-bad-credit/

What's confusing me is the security/collateral deposit for a secured credit card. From what I can tell, your credit limit on that card is equal to the deposit they want you to pay.

So what's the point? If they want a $200 deposit from me in exchange for a credit card that I can only use to spend $200, then I'm out $400 if I use that card with nothing to show for it and a dead credit card that can't be used for any more. I'm really confused. 

I'm seeing secured cards with deposit amounts for $50, $100, $200. I understand what the deposit is for: collateral. I am familiar with that concept. What confuses me is why would someone pay a $50 deposit to start a secured credit card they can only use to pay for $50 worth of goods and services and then that card cannot be used anymore? 

Why even use credit at this level? Would it do me any good? I was hoping to find a credit card that I can a) get approved for and b) use to pay just one regular bill, or my rent, every month. I don't want a credit card for frivolous shopping.

Edited to clarify because I think my own post is also confusing. I looked at this faq: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/creditcards

It says

&gt; The secured card is a credit card where the limit is secured by a deposit in the bank (A secured card with a $500 limit requires $500 in collateral from you). When you charge on the card, it doesn't deduct from that deposit, they only deduct from there if you default on the card. You still pay off the card monthly and that builds credit.... Again, never charge more than you can afford to pay off monthly, and try to keep a low debt ratio (see above).


So based on that if I got a secured card requiring a $50 deposit, and I made that $50 deposit, I would get my new card. But then I could only charge expenses up to $50 on that card and I would reach my limit and be back where I started, out $50 bucks PLUS owing a $50 credit card bill plus interest and fees etc. I can certainly pay a small amount like that every month but it woudl take less than a week for me to rack up $50 on a credit card with a $50 limit and then that would be it??? I just don't see the advantage of such a tiny credit limit on a secured card. Who needs a credit card with a tiny limit if they want to improve their credit they can't even use the card more than once or twice for very small charges and then the card won't even work anymore and I'd be back where I started?

But if I had $500 lying around to make a $500 deposit on a secured card then I wouldn't need to be looking for credit in the first place, I would be paying bills straight away.",finance,1437148179
personalfinance,Paying Off 7.21% Loans vs. Borrowing Less at 6.84% Next Semester,"Hi all, long time reader but first time user here. Feel free to direct me to a different thread if this has already been covered, but I couldn't find anything.

My boyfriend is going into his third year of law school (current loan balance = absurd, interest rate = 7.21%) and has been using his summer associate money to pay off that balance. However, I wanted to make sure that he shouldn't be saving that money so he can borrow less for the upcoming year instead. Though the 2015-16 interest rate is dropping to 6.84%, the origination fee is 4.29%. He will have an additional $12,000 to put toward loans by the end of the summer. What should he do?

TL;DR: Would you rather pay off old loans with 7.21% interest and borrow that money at 6.84% with a 4.29% origination fee &lt;OR&gt; keep the old loans and borrow less at the new rate?",finance,1437149537
personalfinance,I need some financial advice going into my final three semesters of uni.,"Okay so basically this is the rundown (This is cross posted in r/studentloans but I wanted this subs opinion too)... Before I start I came into college as a sophomore with the credits earned in high school and paid off, now I am heading into my final three semesters (hopefully) of my Computer Engineering undergraduate degree.  My first year at uni I took out $6,500 in a federal unsub loan at 3.9% and the rest was paid off from a college fund my parents had for me (Thanks Mom and Dad!).  Last year I took out $7,500 in a fed unsub loan at 4.7% and then a $10,000 private loan at 5.29%.

This summer I have been interning at a coop that is paying me $18/hr, 40 hr/wk, and I have estimated with the funds I came into summer with and my wages, minus the costs of this summer, I should come out with about $7,000.  I have already applied for financial aid again, fed unsub $7,500 at 4.29%.  I am estimating this next year will cost me about $12,000-13,000 just in school related costs.

My question is should I take out a higher private loan now to pay off all the other costs of living and carry that money over to the final semester, or take out smaller loans each semester.  I understand that there would be more interest paid by taking out the larger loan, but I am conflicted which is easier, smarter, looks better (credit wise), and would leave me sitting more financially stable once I graduate.  Also would it be better to consolidate these loans as soon as I graduate?  What would be a good plan of attack to repaying this off within 5-10 years of graduating, do I want to be really aggressive (probably smarter) or more focused on purchasing a house (really big goal for me and my s.o)?

personalfinance,How can I make the most of a small windfall?,"I currently own 2 homes, one is my primary home and one is a rental property. I'm planning on selling the rental property in the next year and expect to net around $40,000 cash after the mortgage is paid off. I'm trying to decide the best way to handle and plan for this. 

Gross annual income is around $90,000. Two working adults ages 29 and 32, one 3 year old child. Primary home was just purchased a year ago with a 30 year conventional loan, 5% down and monthly PMI payment equaling about $100. We both have great credit, so our interest rate is 4.5%. At the time of the windfall, we expect to have one car loan with a $15,000 balance with 2.5 years remaining on the loan and another car loan with a $18,000 balance with 4 years remaining on the loan. Both interest rates are less than 2%. Combined monthly car payments equal $770. We don't have any credit cards with a balance or other debts.

We have no real safety net, maybe 1 month's expenses in savings. We will have about $65,000 between the two of us in 401k's and IRA's. We each save 5-7% of gross pay for retirement, with an employer match of 3.5-5%. We have no college savings plan. We plan on having one more child (2 total). 

I know that I need to build up a better safety net, and we are working on that. Currently setting aside $400 a month in savings. Also working on scaling back expenses where possible to save more. We haven't been disciplined in our savings. We tend to expand our lifestyle as we make more money. 

How much of the windfall should we put towards college savings? 

Should we use the windfall to pay off car loans ($33k of the $40k)? I hesitate to do this because the interest rates are so low, but this would free up $770 per month.

Depending on interest rates, I'd really like to refinance my mortgage to a 15 year term. If I put the whole $40k towards that, I should be able to drop the PMI. My monthly payment shouldn't change a whole lot, but I'd be paying off my loan much faster. I would also incur refinancing fees. I expect our current house to be our ""forever home"" until we are empty-nesters. Real estate values in my area are stable and will probably grow in the future, as we are in the outskirts of very desirable suburbs. Our house is probably on the higher end in price and size for the area. 

Should we pay off the cars, but also refinance the house to a 15 year term? The payment would definitely increase, probably around $300 per month, but our $770 car payments would no longer be around. 

Is there an investment opportunity that I should consider instead of paying off debts?

My question is who in their right mind would take such a poor offer and how can this company wave such a low offer in front of consumers and then do a bait-and-switch with the actual terms?

personalfinance,"21 years old, looking for advice on how to save up or earn more $$ to build my own home and escape the rent trap as early as possible. Is my dream even feasible?","I live in California right in the middle of the bay area so my rent is absolutely outrageous. For a one bedroom, one bath I split with three people the rent was $1,750 a month (with no A.C. or dishwasher either). Our lease is up in August and the rent is going up another $150 a month for a grand total of $1,900 in rent alone.

With a lack of options I'm going to have to resign for at least another 6 months. Split 3 ways I'm still paying $633 a month before utilities for a very cramped living space.  I'm sick of throwing money away and want to start building equity or at least own my own land.

So here is a basic overview of my income. I only make $10 hr serving breakfast at a hotel but i work a full 40 if not a lot more. I make decent tips and with the guaranteed overtime my checks usually have about $900-$1,000 on them every two weeks after taxes and my medical/dental plans. I recently also started training to be an engineer since we are so short staffed and I'm going to have 2 extra shifts a week so that's another $240 a week I'm going to be making as well but that's my only income.

So let's say I make roughly $2,300 a month. Let's talk about expenses now. I pay $650 (clean numbers) in rent. Another $70 in electricity, internet/cable (bundle is the best deal even though we all watch nearly 0 t.v.), Another $190 for phone and car insurance (I'm on family plan with parents and pay them since it's cheaper than getting my own), another $75 for car payments to my father since he loaded me money to buy my car, I drive very little so only about $25 for gas, about $250 for food (I cook and eat very healthy), then I spend about another $140 a month in entertainment.

After all that I should have about $900 a month in savings. With the $2,000 I already have saved up, it would take me almost a whole year just to save $10,000! I'm talking with my GM at work to get a raise since I've been there 2 years but that's a hard battle with ""budget concerns"" and round about answers from her.

I was hoping to get some land up in Oregon but it looks like the cheapest stuff I can find is around $20,000 for just a couple acres of undeveloped land. It's part of dream to build my own home as well so the underdeveloped land is fine but I'd still need to landscape and then add on the cost of the material to build my home so it's going to be even more expensive.

The reason I was thinking of doing it like this was because I hate the thought of having school loans lingering in the back of my mind for so long now. Also, knowing that I owe on credit cards makes me want to pay them off faster because they have a higher interest rate and I know if I don't I'm just going to spin my wheels.

Long time lurker here - and I never thought I’d ever write about this topic, but it is what it is.


So my father just confessed to my brother &amp; I that he has been hiding/ lying to us about his financial situation. 


(1) Student Loan. When we both went to college, he told us that he had money saved up for college,and that we just needed to take some portion in student loan. Both my brother and I took stafford &amp; they are currently in repayment. However, just last week, he told us that it actually wasn’t savings, and that he took out PLUS loan to pay for it…. 

They are as follows

* Consolidated PLUS - $50k,4.88%
* PLUS - $30k, 7.25%
* PLUS - $10k, 7.25%
* PLUS - $29k, 7.25%
* PLUS - $32k, 8%
* PLUS - $33k, 8%


Of course, while we were not happy about him lying to us about having money to go to college (as we both would have picked a cheaper option…) again, it is what it is, and we are willing to contribute to the payment… but $185k is more money than either of us have ever touched…


(2) Credit Card. Due to their spending &amp; student loan payments, they were running about $2.6k deficit per month for a while. So it seems like that they have been supplementing with their credit cards. The credit debt comes out to $64k with average interest rate of approx 15%. 


13k with Discover, 2k with Credit Union, 26k with Chase, 20k with Bank of America, 2k with Capital One.

(3) Retirement: He just told us that they have saved $0 for the retirement. So we will be relying on his SS ($1247/mo), mom’s SS ($1345/mo) &amp; mom’s pension ($1991) for their retirement (absent their retirement savings that I am not aware of). 


(4) Pooled Money: We were able to pool funds with our relatives to the tune of little bit over $100k. He immediately wanted to spend it to pay off the credit cards, but we are currently making him wait while we figure out what to do.


CURRENT INCOME: They both make $97,000 combined a year on a pre-tax basis. Take home comes out to about $5279/mo.


EXPENSES: We are currently trying to figure this out. We are sitting with them this week/ next week to get this sorted. 


GAME PLAN: So this is where I wanted to ask for your opinions. 


As far as student loan goes, we’ve considered consolidating with Sofi, but it seems like consolidated PLUS loans are eligible for income contingent plan (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven) - so we think that’s the approach we will take to limit the monthly repayment to 20% of their ""discretionary income"" (I am trying to figure out what the definition of ""discretionary income"" is for the purpose of loan payments). 


For credit cards, he wants to pay off everything with $100k that we collected. But, our preference would be to look for 0% balance transfer cards (Chase Slate (15 months), Discover IT (18 months), Citi Simplicity (21 months)) as much as we can, so that they can actually pay the balance down, without touching $100k as much as possible. Regardless, they will keep $100k, but we just to avoid running into this situation 10 years from now again… with another $60-$100k in credit card debt.

personalfinance,My federal loans for grad school aren't going to cover as much as I thought. What should I do?,"Hello everyone, I am preparing to start graduate school and had created an informal budget that took into account working part time and using extra money from my federal student loans. I recently checked over my expenses again and realized that there were some items that I had overlooked. Because of this, I will have very little extra student loan money to help cover my expenses. I have enough money saved up to cover at least 2 months worth of rent, plus moving costs. 

My question is, should I:
1. Work as much as I can and make due with what I have. This would mean that I would most likely be working close to full time while in graduate school full time. I'm also moving to a city with a high rental rate, so I would have to find a small, minimal apartment.
-or-
2. Take out private student loans. I already have accepted the max amount for federal loans, plus I have federal loans from my undergrad. I will most likely be able to utilize the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, as I am getting my master's in counseling and plan on working for nonprofit organizations. 

My main concern is that if I take out the loans, I will have way too much to pay back once I graduate, putting my in a bad financial situation at that point.

personalfinance,Help on massive student loan debt,"Hello, please don't hurt me. Wall of text.

I went to undergraduate with relatively small loans, about 5 grand in total, pretty low interest. 

Then I went to graduate school, health profession. Private school, relatively high cost. Yeah, it would have been great had I waited around patiently and became a resident in a state with a state-school, but this us not what happened. I graduated with about 315,000 in debt. 

Then I was in an internship for a year, and was in forbearance. I earned 37k a year in a place with a high cost of living and chose not to make any payments. 

Then, I did income-based repayment (gets 'forgiven' after 20 years). Because of my internship I didn't actually owe anything for the first year. And I didn't pay anything. I should have paid *something*, but made excuses because I had moved states, was getting on my feet, then ended up needing to replace my car, etc. 

Now, 2 years out, age 27, now married without children or a house (we rent), my repayment has been recalculated to be about 300 a month. That we can do, easy. But it's not so easy in the long run.

My total debt now is $356,000 because interest has accrued. My average % is 6.81, but some of these loans are as high as 7.9. Fortunately, my spouse has no debt. I earn 65k/year, he earns 20.

I feel like this is a losing situation. It seems like, in order for my balance to *not* increase, I would have to pay 2k per month. And then I'd still have 356k of debt. 

In ~19 years, my balance will be forgiven, but that forgiveness amount is taxable. By my calculations, the worst case scenario (i.e. if I pay basically nothing, ever) is owing $435k in taxes in 19 years.

The only real way out I can see is working at a non-profit for 10 years (I'd get forgiven tax-free). I don't know if that will happen honestly, as everyone in my profession who has worked either for the government or a 501c3 is miserable and doesn't stay very long. The other option is working at an actual (non-profit) school, if I were to specialize and be able to work in a clinic or teach or something. It would mean 3 or more years with minimal salary, but I could earn 100-150k/year after. It is competitive though, so I'm not sure I *can* pursue this.

My other ideas are investment. My husband has an excellent return on a investment-based (high risk) savings account (taxable, but whatever); the interest rate has been consistently higher than my student loan rate. If I could count on that kind of interest rate (i know I can't, but bear with me) it would make more sense to put whatever extra money I have into that kind of account (rather than try to put out the forestfire of a loan and fail) and use that account to pay that huge tax sum in 19 years. And if I *do* work at a school and get forgiven without strings attached, that's lovely.


Of course, we'd want to, you know, be able to own property and have children etc. But at this point I don't know if either of those are responsible, or in the case of a house, if this is smarter than renting (we could get a mortgage for not much more than rent in our area, forgetting about downpayment for a second) and if owning a house will help in the future in terms of taxes and repayment and such. 

Does anyone have any advice on this? I don't want 46 year old me to be destitute and angry at current-me because of shitty decisions.

Need a reliable car I can drive for work by August and I know nothing about cars.**

I got a job in a city 800 miles away where I don't know anyone and I need a car by first week of August. I have never owned a car before this. I have $2500 to spend max on car (that includes any immediate costs). I know jack shit about cars and after looking here and some other forums for a while  I went to a credit union in the city I'm relocating to and talked to them. They said an auto loan will be declined because my credit history only has student loans. I just got a credit card (a week ago) and that is not on there so I can't get an auto loan before I start my job (first week of august). 


I also went to dealers, namely Carmax, a local dealer that claimed to deal with no credit and a nissan dealer. The Carmax dealer approved the loan but required paystub (which means I would need a temporary mode of transportation for 2-3 weeks before I can show them the paystub). The local dealer said he could get me loan but it will be at higher interest rates (didn't quote me an exact one but said could be 9-13%). Finally, the Nissan dealership really tried hard to make me buy a new car (Nissan Altima 2015) under their recent college graduate program for $310/month for 72 months @ 4.3% interest. But the insurance on new cars were $100/month more (quote from Geico). 

I also found another Nissan car (Nissan Versa Sedan) that may qualify for the same deal online with per month rate expected to be $210/month assuming 60 month payment @4% interest but the dealership didn't mention anything about that car (the salesperson definitely wanted to make me buy the altima because she was very pushy about it and tried to convince me for 40 minutes after I said I'll think about it). I'm also afraid that the used car dealer I talked to (the no credit guy) will do a spot delivery and get me a shittier car that may be unreliable. I need to ensure I make a good impression at work as this is my first full time job. I can't afford to have an unreliable car.  My monthly car budget (including gas, maintenance and car payments) is at most $800 (25% of my estimated gross income). I noticed that even a used car may cost me ~$600/month but a new one with higher insurance but lower interest rate may cost me ~$750-800/month (I'm assuming $200 for gas and $50 for maintenance every month). I'm assuming I will drive around 15000 miles/year as well. After accounting for my living expenses (food, utilities, rent, booze money, health insurance, student loans) I will be able to contribute 15-19% of my income on savings (emergency fund) or retirement. 

So my question is would a new car be a wise choice at lower interest than old car at higher interest rate? Should I just try to get a used one for cheap or would I risk getting a worse deal (high interest rate) on a worse car since I know very little about cars period?",finance,1437230009

My wife is a medical resident with ~$300k of federal student loans at 6.875% interest. I have a good paying job that isn't going away making ~$130k and she makes ~$50k as a resident. Her loans are currently in an income based repayment plan and we file separately, so her monthly payments are around $500. We took this route because our goal is to have the loans forgiven, which happens after she works for a nonprofit for 10 years (most hospitals are nonprofit).

I'm starting to get a little worried because our monthly payment does not even cover the interest accrued each month (~$1,720) , so the debt is getting larger fast.

Now my wife has 4 more years making her current salary, an at the end of that would have put 6 years in working for a nonprofit. Of course, if she goes into private practice at the end of 6 years, we own the debt and the extra interest accrued. Her annual salary at that point can be anywhere from $180k to $300k depending on what specialty she chooses

We also put money away for retirement each month ($2.1k/month into a 401k and $1k/month into a managed account) and we have our emergency fund of $20k that is set aside if something catastrophic happens. We have a mortgage on our home ($2k/month), and the neighborhood is only going to increase in value. Additionally, we have no debt other than our mortgage ($260k/30 year) and her loans.

When it first started, the CD was making 3.5% interest, but that shrank to 2% by 2009, and is now at 0.02%.

Since interest rates were so low in 2009, I kept letting the account renew for 1 year term, hoping that I could lock the IRA in for a longer period once interest rates went up.  Since then, the account has been auto-renewing for a 1 year term each October since 2007.  My account is due to mature in October and I want to invest the full amount in a better way.  (To be clear, I am keeping it within the IRA, but want it put in something better than a CD).

I want to consolidate for a lower IR but have been continuously denied by both SoFi and DRB (Darien Rowayton Bank), either for having too low of an income-to-debt ratio ($63k income / $108k debt) or not having a credit-worthy cosigner. I myself have a credit score around 740, but it seems that neither of my parents have a sufficiently high score to cosign. 

Is there anything I can do? I tried consolidating last year and was denied as well, and I expect to be denied until my income-to-debt ratio increases significantly. I just want to make sure I've tried everything I can before I give up and just grit my teeth through this. With my current interest rates, I'm losing over $700 / mo in accrued interest for private loans alone, which is incredibly demoralizing. 

I also have several federal loans totaling around $30k, minimum payments of $300 / mo, although I'm not looking to consolidate those because the IR is reasonable. The rest of my finances seem to be  in order: I have $5k in emergency funds, I'm applying the max matched percentage of income to my 401k, my budget is as airtight as it'll ever get, and I'll be freeing up $500+ / mo once I move out of my current apartment at the end of the month (which I'll be applying to loans).

personalfinance,"(30)F Life insurance policy with cash out option. Leave it alone, or cash out and invest?","When I was a small child my father purchased a $25K life insurance policy for me. He has always had the payments set up on auto pay, $6 a month I think. The policy has a 6% interest rate and at this point the interest earned pays for the policy premiums. The payments continue to auto withdraw and deposit towards the policy. The policy now has approximately a $4,300 cash out value.

I would normally just keep sending them money treating it like a savings account because 6% is pretty good. The downside is that at some point the company starts to reject the payments and sends back a portion of the payments. So there goes that idea.

I have life insurance for both me and my spouse through work that would cover our debts and funeral costs. Between the house, student loans and one vehicle we have about 150K in debt all less than 4% interest. 

I have also deposited no less than 12% of my earnings into 401K with matches from my company. (I think I have a good start on retirement.)

My options:
**Cash out and pay down debt:** I don't think this is worth it because the interest on my debts is less than the interest earned on the policy.
**Cash out and roll into 401K:** I feel like I have a good start for retirement and this just doesn't sound ""exciting"" if I'm honest.
**Cash out and roll into a different kind of investing:** I have been thinking about starting an investment account where I could use the money PRIOR to getting old if it does well. Vacations, luxury purchases etc. (If it does well). At least with this I could contribute more than $6 a month in addition to the initial $4,300.
**Keep the life insurance policy as is:** Simple but is it the logical thing to do?

I'll be honest I would really like to take the money to invest to potentially earn ""play"" money. $4,300 isn't going to relieve a bunch of stress or enable a much needed purchase. I'm asking here because I would like to make sure my idea isn't completely irrational. If it is a good a idea I would appreciate a good lead into what kind of investments I should look into or avoid.

Bonus Question: My brother (27)M has the same policy but is in a very different financial situation. Lives with GF, some debt, dodgy vehicle, living month to month. I think it would be good for him to cash out and buy reliable vehicle as long has he wouldn't leave his GF with a load of debt/bills if something happened.",finance,1437239419
personalfinance,new college grad (22y/o) in need of car advice,"Hi everyone - my parents are financially clueless people (foreclosure, hefty debt, etc.), so I turn to you. My biggest question is how much to save and how much to pay down on a car. I've never had my own car, and my parents have told me to lease one. What I've read online says that leasing is not always a great idea. I will be in an area that requires me to drive to work (highways). I've already chosen a place that is about $100-150 more than the average apartment in the area because it is new, large (~800 sq ft!), and well-located. I really do not care what type of car I have or the size - I just want it to be affordable.

Here's my situation... I begin work in September and have 15k in loans that I begin paying in January 2016 and 4k in loans with a grace period that ends in May 2016. 

* base salary: 75k/yr
* relocation check: 3k
* targeted bonus: 8k
* rent: 1300/mnth
* utilities: ~200/mnth
* budgeted groceries: $350/mnth

* loan min (starting May): ~270/month

When I was born, a few family members purchased investments for me under UTMA (NY) with my parents. These holdings (both DRIP plans with large corporations) are currently in an account with Computershare, and total about $5,700.

Now that I'm of age, I've opened an individual account with Vanguard and put a few thousand dollars of my savings into a LifeStrategy Growth fund, which I hope will outpace the interest rate of my savings account during my college years before I begin contributing to my retirement savings when I enter the workforce. 

A few questions:

* From what I've read on this sub, it would probably be beneficial to me to diversify, sell the individual DRIP holdings and move those funds into my account with Vanguard. Am I on the right track here? Are there any tax liabilities or extra paperwork that I need to be concerned about or otherwise affected by?

* On an somewhat related note, is the [LifeStrategy Growth fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0122&amp;FundIntExt=INT) the right fund for me to be investing in at this point? It looks like the [Target Retirement 2060 fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1691&amp;FundIntExt=INT) has outpaced it by about a percentage point in the past 3 years (probably due to the larger allocation to international stocks), but that's really not enough to make me sweat over.

* This may all be a moot point due to the UTMA status of the account these holdings are in. I have full access to the account and seem to be able to execute transactions - will I be able to do this now or will I have to wait until I'm 21, which is when the account officially becomes mine from what I've read?

personalfinance,check My expense ratio math. I cant find a website that does these kind of comparisons.,"Hey, PF.  I'm starting to make financial decisions based on math I'm doing at my kitchen table, and that's a dangerous proposition.


My goal was to be able to graph the required interest rate one fund would have to achieve in order to net me the same return as another fund with a different expense ratio.


I'm not sure when and how expenses are charged (probably at the end of each quarter), but since everything is usually listed in APY I made the assumption that you pay once at the end of the year.  Here is what I got:


Where Inv=Investment     i=interest (APY)   ER=expense ratio (APY)


**The cost of having your investments handled in a fund is equal to your investment with any gains multiplied by the fund's expense ratio** 

Cost = Inv*[1+(i/100)]*(ER/100)


**The balance of your fund after your expenses have been deducted is:**

Balance = Inv*[1+(i/100)] - Cost   or    Inv*[1+(i/100)] - Inv*[1+(i/100)]*(ER/100)


**Comparing Fund A to Fund B, set the balances equal to each other**

Balance_A = Balance_B


Inv*[1+(iA/100)] - Inv*[1+(iA/100)]*(ERa/100) = Inv*[1+(iB/100)] - Inv*[1+(iB/100)]*(ERb/100)


**The amount invested is the same in both cases.  Divide both sides by Inv**

[1+(iA/100)] - [1+(iA/100)]*(ERa/100) = [1+(iB/100)] - [1+(iB/100)]*(ERb/100)

Simplifies to

1+(iA/100) - (ERa/100) - (iA*ERa/10000) = 1+(iB/100) - (ERb/100) - (iB*ERb/10000)


**Subtracting 1 from both sides, adding (ERa/100) to both sides and multiplying both sides by 100**

(iA) - (iA*ERa/100) = (iB) - (ERb) + (ERa) - (iB*ERb/100)

Simplifies to

iA[1-(ERa/100)]=iB[1-ERb/100] + (ERa - ERb)

Simplifies to

iA=iB*[1-ERb/100]/[1-ERa/100] + [ERa - ERb]/[1-ERa/100]

He talked over me and then pressed a confirmation button I'm assuming. Because the next thing out of his mouth was ""congratz! you were approved for a full line of credit""

personalfinance,Unknowingly signed up for a credit card. No way to access/check/monitor new card.,"I want to start out by saying I feel incredibly dumb for letting this happen. I am young, naive and just moved to a very large city to which I am not use to (farm boy to big eastern city ) fyi this was in a large retail store. 

Long story short, I thought I was signing up for a rewards card like they have in grocery stores. The sales rep never once said it was a CREDIT card, he just offered to take an additional percentage off my items. Of course I said sure! After I realized what was going on, it was too late to cancel it and I was too afraid to speak up. I panicked and left as soon as I paid for the items.

I have a few issues



*    I didn't want the store to have my social so I wasn't very thoughtful when I punched it in. (I  thought it was odd they wanted my social for a rewards card ) so the card could have the wrong social but with my name, my driver's license info was taken.


*  The sales rep was foreign and when I was prompted to enter my annual income ( which I also thought was strange for a rewards card) I entered 50,000 by mistake and asked him to change it. He talked over me and then pressed a confirmation button I'm assuming. Because the next thing out of his mouth was ""congratz! you were approved for a full line of credit""
* I struggle with social anxiety, I felt helpless, taken advantage of and distraught I wanted to get the hell out of there and curl up in a ball. So from here I went along with it. He asked me to enter my new number for a purchase onto the screen.( He printed some details about my new card, only including my name and acc number and then handed it to me) I entered the new number and the transaction wasn't going thru. I don't think it said declined but the screen just kept refreshing. So I paid with another card and then booked it out of there.

I guess this was a long story ( sorry ) but I don't know what to do!

tldr problems

   * Idk if the social is right on a new card that has my name on it!
   * Annual income was goofed on the application
   * The card number is not being recognized by the online account activation system ( idk if more time is needed for everything to go thru)
   * the physical card is being shipped to an address I no longer live at, but that mail is being forwarded to a relative who I won't see until Christmas.

idk if I'll get in trouble for the social being wrong, goofed annual income. And I have no way of checking any of the information. Any advice is welcome. Thanks",finance,1437269166

personalfinance,My dad is gifting me stock to help pay for grad school. Best way to take advantage of this?,"I'm 25 and just about to begin my MBA. The degree will cost about $86k, I've received a $10k scholarship, and i have access to $61.5K from the Federal Direct Grad Loan at 5.84%. This leaves me with about $15k that I need to cover, plus books, fees, and other non-tuition expenses.

My dad has graciously offered to help finance the degree by gifting me $30k in stocks that he inherited from his mother (who had inherited them from her mother). I don't know what specific stocks they are, but I'm told they're old blue chip stocks like GE and such.

First, I believe I'm correct in thinking he can gift the whole $30k at once without getting taxed, using the $14k annual gift exemption and taking the remaining $16k out of his $5M lifetime gift exemption, yes?

Second, what's the best way to handle these stocks? I would think liquidating them is a pretty poor idea. Initially, I was thinking of selling them gradually to stay within the 0% long-term cap gain bracket, and then dumping them into my rIRA, but this doesn't seem to give me much utility in terms of grad school support. I do have the option to take out a loan through my credit union at 4-5%, so it is possible to cover that $15k nugget and leaving the index fund to grow. Perhaps this is best?

Some things to consider: 1) I have an emergency fund; 2) I'm getting my employer match; 3) I'm paying the minimums on $35k of undergrad debt, of which the interest rate is 3-4% and subsidized; 4) currently any extra income is going into my Roth IRA, which has a balance of $5k; 5) The degree is part time and I will continue to work full time through the program, thus living expenses are taken care of while I'm in school.

investing,Are we in an equity bubble right now?,"Let me explain. As most of us already know, the market tends to go in cycles. Normally the Fed interest rates would fluctuate with the strength/weakness of the economy. But since the Fed has decided time and time again to keep interest rates near zero since 2009 its hardly and indicator of the health of the economy anymore. Personally, I think we are in the midst of an equity bubble since the S&amp;P 500, DJIA, and Nasdaq are as high as they are right now.

I have a considerable amount of money waiting to be invested from life insurance after my dad passed. If it was normal market conditions, I would've locked 80-90% of it into stock funds by now. But everyone is talking about the market being overvalued so I've been hesitating. I intend to use a buy and hold strategy for at least 10+ years. But if there is a 30% correction, is there a point? Or should I just be patient? The uncertainty of all this is keeping me up at night. I just want to lock it down and not have to worry about it anymore.

So far, most of my money is earning very little interest in MMA's and high yield savings accounts. I looked into bond funds but I don't want to put it in anything longer than short-term because of anticipated interest rate hikes - and those funds are earning even less than my high yield savings accounts anyway (and include expenses).

I have some money which has been lying around for years not earning me any interest.

I do not need this money at the moment, and am happy to set it away in an inaccessible account for a couple of years.

I don't really know anything about this process I'm afraid, and that is why I am asking for some advice. What kind of account should I open? What kind of interest rates should I expect? Where can I get the best interest rates? I have heard that I can get about 10% interest if I put it into an Indian bank. However, with this comes the risk accompanying currency exchange. Is this risk anything to be concerned about?

I'm a 23 year old fresh college grad. In college, I made a lot of mistakes and learned from them but now I'm lying in the debt bed I made.

I have a big girl job and work on a decent livable salary. I work in sales so my base salary (the salary guaranteed without commission) is 2000/mo. Taking control of my finances and being responsible with money is a foreign concept to me so when I started making money, I created a Mint account and set up a budget:

100 - phone
100 - groceries (Food pantries surprisingly give away a substantial amount of food for free)
200 - car (will be paid off by march 2016)
120 - gas
200 - debt 
190 - car insurance

Now, I have other ""misc"" expenses (Netflix, entertainment etc) but the above budget is the bare bones minimum/what I'd need to survive.

My question is, what other courses of action should I be taking to kick start Operation Fix Credit besides opening a secured credit card? I want to consolidate all this debt and was also wondering if it'd be worth it to see a debt consolidator.

personalfinance,"Business manager at dealership was a total jerk, want to make sure if he was being a truthful jerk.","So went shopping for cars yesterday with my dad after lots of research into the whole process (including memorizing all the car buying guides/threads that appeared on here.) I applied for pre-approval through two banks (USAA and my local bank) and a local credit union but the loan approvals had not come through yet. I had my budget and everything sorted out, but I wanted to see what I would get for a loan before I did any serious buying.

My dad and I found a great car at a good price, in my budget, and we decided to talk to the business manager about what he could offer me for a loan. We were still just shopping around and since the other pre-approvals haven't come in yet, I wasn't going to say yes to anything.

What I expected was the interest rate to be high since this is the case with most dealerships, whether they use their own financing services or use multiple national banks. 

What I didn't expect was for the business manager to be a total fucking asshole. Before I sat down, he told me that I wouldn't be able to get a loan with less than 15% interest. I asked why because my credit report, while my accounts are only 5 years old, is spotless. He told me that since all I had for loans/credit on the account were my student loans, I have zero credit in the eyes of the bank. He told me ""no one actually pays those things [student loans], so we don't even consider them anymore.""

My dad then asked if it would help if he consigned. My dad has great credit (820 fico score) and had just got his own small car loan in January for 2% interest. Business manager told him that it wouldn't make a difference because my credit was so terrible and then told my dad that he didn't believe him that he got 2% interest on his loan. (The car loan was for 5,000 for a 2005 mazda that he bought from my brother, and yes, the interest was actually 2%).

The whole experience was very jarring, especially since we had had such a great experience with the sales rep and the staff when it came to looking at/inspecting/test driving cars.

I'm getting married pretty young, and I'm going to be the one running our finances. Save the lectures, I've had plenty - I'm looking forward to her federal income withholding exemptions.

Anyways, we will have a $5000 emergency fund, which will be enough to cover rent and all other essential expenses for two months. Since we're still so young though, I've been doing research into ways we can grow our money aggressively while maintaining a good amount of liquidity.

What I've settled on is a 4-week T note ladder, with weekly investments of $1000. I would keep 1000 in a savings account at all times and only have 4 T-notes running at once. Once the first one matures, I would then use the proceeds to immediately buy one to replace it. If we turn a $5 profit from each note &amp; have 4 notes mature per month, we would earn $240 a year plus $10 on our $1000 on the bank, assuming we have a 1 percent rate of return there. $250 a year on $5000 is 5%, and that's a hell of a return from what I've been reading.

If my wife were to lose her job, or I were to lose my athletic scholarship, we would have the balance of our emergency fund back in our account by the end of the first month.

Is there a way to outperform 5% while maintaining this liquidity? I'm very wary of the markets and want to make sure we won't be SOL if shit hits the fan in our lives.

personalfinance,Should I temporarily stop contributing to my IRA to help save a 20% down payment for a house?,"My wife and I are both 27 making a combined $182k/year gross.  My employer matches $0.80 for every dollar I contribute to my (traditional) 401k up to 8% of my gross income ($90k/year) AND contributes 3% of my income automatically.  My wife's employer does not offer a retirement savings plan.  We've been contributing the IRS limit to Roth IRAs in each of our names.  We both have excellent credit, and we're pre-approved for a mortgage loan from a couple different lenders.

We're considering building a house for close to $400k.  We currently have a little over $30k saved for a down payment, and we're living rent-free with my wife's parents, so we're saving the majority of our paychecks.  We wouldn't close on a new construction until sometime in December, January, or possibly February, depending on how long the builder is willing to give us (obviously, the more time they give us, the easier it will be to get to 20% down and leave more savings for an emergency fund).  I'm debating stopping our IRA contributions just for the remainder of the year/until we close in order to put an extra nearly $1k into savings each month.  If we do decide to do this, we would likely be able to save enough at the beginning of next year to still max out our 2015 contributions before April 15, 2016.  I understand the potential ramifications due to lost interest/dollar cost averaging, and there's of course a chance we wouldn't be able to max out our 2015 contributions given the additional expenses for a new house; though, we have all the furniture we'll need for at least the first couple years, and appliances are included in the price of the home, so those big purchases are already accounted for.  Anyway, would the benefit of reaching (or not having to stretch as far for) a 20% down payment and the accompanying PMI avoidance and best possible interest rate compensate for the disadvantages of temporarily stopping our IRA contributions?



EDIT: In the interest of continuing a helpful discussion and addressing some points of contention, I thought I'd add a few more details.  First of all, I really appreciate all (well, most) of your comments; I came here for different perspectives, and I've certainly heard them through mostly productive discussion.  So thanks for that.

Now, I certainly understand that my wife and I are fortunate to be in a very favorable financial situation.  We've both worked hard to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees that, in turn, led to well-paying careers.  We're also fortunate to have parents (both hers and mine) who are happy to help us out while we transition from grad student life to the ""real world"".  We've only been living with my in-laws for about a month, and we're trying to save up as much as possible in ~6 months, because if try to make the builders wait too long, we could lose the opportunity to build the house we want.  As for the comments asking where all our money is going, we do have student loans and a car payment, cell phone bills, car insurance, and food/miscellaneous expenses to pay for ourselves, which account for ~$2k/month.  Like /u/cam_zilles suggested, we're taking in ~$10k/month after taxes.  Again, we have ~$30k saved right now, and we're targeting a down payment around $80k.  Even saving $8k/month (that is, without contributing to our IRAs), we'd need 6-7 months to save the additional $50k we need.  Add on top of that even just an extra month to have something of an e-fund left after the down payment.  

It would be fine if we could stay with my in-laws as long as we needed to save this amount, and while my in-laws would be happy to let us stay, the builder may not be so flexible.  They obviously want to sell all their lots as soon as possible, so to ensure we're able to get one of the lots we'd prefer in this particular new community - which is in a great location for home values, proximity to work, good school districts, etc. - we're kind of at the mercy of the builder as far as how long they're willing to delay starting to build/closing on our home.  As it stands now, the earliest we could feasibly close would be December, though we may be able to get the builder to agree to delay things a month or two.  In any event, hopefully you can see how we're cutting it close even with potentially stopping IRA contributions (realistically, we may have to stop IRA contributions AND take out some or all of the allowed $10k from my IRA for a first-time home purchase).  Hence, I hoped to gain some perspective on whether or not the benefit of more easily reaching a 20% down payment with some remaining e-funds could outweigh the cost of reducing retirement savings at a fairly young age.",finance,1437326113

2. What issues will this raise if I try to get a mortgage for a new house?  When we got our first home the bank gave us a lot of hassle about some money my mom gave us towards a down payment.  We having been looking to upgrade and this would certainly help with the down payment.

personalfinance,UK - should my parents refinance with 250k 2.5% interest mortgage,"Hello, my parents (who will be retiring in 12 years) have a mortgage with a remaining lifetime of 11 years.

personalfinance,"$9,000 in debt from college with 0 credit. Need advice!","Hey everyone,

So I'm not one to ask for help which I know is a bad thing, because once I ask for help my situation usually seems pretty bleak. A great example is my situation right now.

I went to school and due to lack of finances and for my own mental health, I have decided to take a year off. That being said, I'm still paying for my tuition from last year. I don't have any credit because I've never had a loan in my name or a credit card. I also cannot receive the federal loans anymore because the deadline for the loan for the 2014-2015 aid year is over. 

I had my financial situation figured out, but then it all became a mess. My mom quit her job and was unemployed for some time during the 2014 year. My mom and step-dad are also splitting up after 12 years of marriage.  My parents have numerous bills and very bad credit, obviously from the home foreclosure, so my mom thought telling the financial aid office at my school all of this would help. Well it did not. They basically told her that having the school do a refinancing process for my home life would mean more aid for me, instead my federal loans were taken away. The refinancing process required numerous documents, and they continued to ask for more and more documents. Because my situation was being refinanced my financial aid was taken away until the process was completed. By the time they finished it, it was too late to get my loans back. Now I owe my school $9,100 with it increasing each month, and I have no way of paying it back.

I have no credit, so getting a loan is obviously not going to be easy for me. My mom has such a low credit score that she wouldn't be able to cosign either, and I already know my step dad will not cosign a loan with me, but his credit is bad anyway. That leaves me with a debt I'm not sure how to pay back and will continue to increase each month.

Because it's so late in the year and the new school year is about to start I can't do a payment plan on my debt. Basically I have to pay it all at once in order to stop the late fees from accumulating. 

The reason I wrote all of this is because I'm hoping that someone out there will be able to help me figure out an option to hopefully help me pay this off without accumulating more late fees. Also because I'm taking a year off I know my mom will have to start paying the $30,000 parent plus loan she took out my freshman year when our financial/family situation wasn't so bleak. If I am able to return in a year will she be able to defer it again, or will she have to continue to pay it off?

I hope someone will be able to read this and help out, and I thank you ahead of time for helping me.

Sincerely,

Someone who needs help

My loans are split into about 5 ranging from 6.6% interest right now to 5.5%.  Will it be likely I can reduce it?

- My parents cosigned the private loans.  Do they have to give their consent to have them consolidated?  They haven't made any payments it's just been me.

- If my parents do give consent are they able to view the information I give in the application?

I would rather them not post my info all over FB/talk about it (yes they are horribly toxic people like that).

I like having my emergency fund and “cushion” of splurge money, but it’s obviously not doing me any good just letting my income grow with no investment.

personalfinance,Making payments on a car I no longer own - is there anything I can do?,"At the end of 2013, I bought a car at a used car dealership for about $7,000. The dealership worked with a nearby finance company that offered financing to people with poor credit (I'm slowly rebuilding mine) to finance the price of the car, minus the down payment of $1700. The interest rate was high (29%, I believe) but it was my only real option and I planned on refinancing once I made payments for a year or so. I was a full time pizza delivery driver at the time so without a car, I was out of work. 

Made all my payments on time and less than a year later, the car blew up. It was a TDI VW Jetta and I let it run too low on oil. Overall it was obviously my fault, although I was surprised I didn't get a warning light.  The VW dealership (not the used car lot) wanted more than the car was worth to fix it, and the ""warrantee"" that came with the car was based on the mileage the car had, and I had driven it quite a bit (I averaged 25-30k miles a year) so it wasn't any help. My insurance company wanted nothing to do with it. So I bought a 90s Geo Metro from my brother in law, and agreed to pay him $200 a month for a few months for it, so I could keep working. 

This made paying the finance company difficult, and I fell two months behind before we are able to settle everything. They were kind enough to take the car, sell it, and take that off my balance. Unfortunately, it sold for only $500, and after all associated fees, my balance didn't really change. I then was able to get them to refinance my loan at 0% interest so that I could just pay it off. My current payment is $150/month. 

So now I'm paying down a loan for literally nothing. Nobody really wronged me or anything, but it still really sucks and it'll be another 3 years before I've paid it off. I graduated from college a month ago and I now have a better job in my field (no more pizza delivery), but the Geo died so I'm also now paying monthly on a Honda (this time at a fair rate through a credit union), and my student loans will be in repayment by the end of the year. $2,000 a year is a lot for me that could go to better use. 

Do I have any options that might make this easier on me? I don't make much money yet and this monthly payment for literally nothing is making things more difficult than they need to be.

personalfinance,I want to start a college fund for my unborn nephew...,"I'm a 21 year old girl living in Alberta, Canada who does NOT have her finances in check. I have ~$15,000 in federal and provincial student loans that I accumulated from two years of radio school. I also have about $1000 in credit card debt that I pay about $100 on each month (before racking it up again.) I have successfully landed a pretty decent gig (for a first ""real"" job in radio) and make anywhere from $1200-$1400 a month. I pay $500 in rent, about $200 on food, $110 on cellphone and the rest is usually blown on random stuff. So yes, I am very aware of my financial situation! 

My brother and his wife are expecting tier first child in late November. They have never really made more than ends meet but I know what they lack in money, they will make up for in love and fun, which is how we were raised so I'm not too concerned. What I am concerned about is when baby E grows up and doesn't have any financial cushion to start post-secondary with. My brother and his wife along with 90% of my extended family never had post-secondary education and I really think a big reason for that was fear of accumulating student debt due to no college funds. I can't imagine my brother or his wife will be able to manage a college fund for the time being and I don't want to push it on them to do, but I really, really want to change the cycle of no school &gt; bad jobs &gt; no school &gt; bad jobs. Obviously I understand there are ways around this (in my case taking the hit of student loans) but I would like to at least TRY.

I know it sounds ridiculous but I already love this baby. I text my sister in law every week with ""happy week ____!"" I have burst out into tears and laughter at the mere thought of becoming an auntie and I really want to be a positive influence on baby E's life. 

So, I'm hoping to get some advice on how to set up a college fund for somebody else's child. I know zero things about investments or savings funds and would really like some ELI5 style advice. What would be the minimum amount I could save each month, and still make a difference in 18 years? When should I start? Can I go to my normal bank? Etc. 

Thank you so much! 

Edit: Please understand that I do realize the importance of my own finances. Saying ""figure out your own issues first"" is good advice, but not the advice I'm needing. I do have plans to figure out my own debt and I'm aware of how to do that. I would appreciate some advice on the logistics of setting up the college fund. Thanks again.",finance,1437350667

Altın fiyatları Yunanistan krizinin çözümünün ardından yaşanacak risklerin azalması nedeniyle son 5 yılın en düşüğünü gördü.

Altın, geçen hafta Mart ayından bu yana en sert değer kaybını kaydettikten sonra bugün dolardaki değer artışı ve küresel enflasyon görünümünün güçlü olmayışının etkisiyle kritik destek seviyesinin altına inerek yüzde 3.9 düşüşle ons başına 1,089.8 dolardan işlem gördü.

personalfinance,Just got my first credit card. When should I get a second (or third) card?,"**Backstory**

Financed a car recently. Credit score is low 600's. Was told during the financing process that I was a ""ghost."" (only debt on history is small (sub $5k) student loan which is paid on time, I've never had a CC because I figured I couldn't get into CC debt if I didn't have a CC) 

Car salesman said he used to work in the credit industry and advised I get a credit card to build my score so I could get better interest rates and easier loan approvals if/when I buy a house.

Car insurance agency offered me a CC stating that if I used it to pay my new car insurance that they'd reduce my payments $4/mo. Annual fee is $35 so, to me, it sounded like I save $13/yr if all I do is pay my insurance with the card. My plan is to set up automatic payments, stick the card in a drawer, and don't think about it outside of seeing it reported on Mint.com. This will put the card at a 8.2% monthly utilization, which I believe is good.

**Question**

I'm thinking I should get a good CC for daily expenditures to help build my credit and, possibly, reap benefits from some sort of reward program. I understand that multiple inquiries into my credit over a short time can be detrimental. I also understand that due to my low credit score I probably won't be eligible for a great CC for a while so if I get a second CC, it may just be a stepping stone to a better one.

**How long should I wait** until I try to get a second credit card? Assume I'm watching both the calendar and my credit score.",finance,1437400656
personalfinance,Should I let my boyfriend pay my student loans to save for our future?,"Hi PF,

I'm not sure how well this fits here, but I'm looking for any financial or personal perspectives:

I don't have a problem, but more of a too good to be true situation, and I am looking for a little advice. I see people comment a lot that you shouldn't take on debt for someone else, unless you are willing to count it as a loss. I am asking as the person who would get their debt paid. I'm worried I am not thinking clearly about this since I feel overwhelmed, guilty, like a mooch, and almost incredulous. 

Basically, I have about 35K in student loans, with interest rates varying from 5-7%. I am paying them off with a decent government job salary, but I am going to end up paying about 11K in interest over the life of the loans. (I have exhaustively researched forgiveness options. I would finish paying right as ten years hits).

My boyfriend (who I have every intention to marry in the coming years), has a decent amount of money in a cash account, and plenty more invested. He and his wonderful parents (one of whom is a fantastic financial adviser), independently thought that there is no reason why I should pay that 11K in interest when he has that money doing nothing. So, my boyfriend has offered to pay off my 35K in loans, and let me pay him monthly over 8 or so years (however long it takes). They all think it would be better for our future to save that 11K for our future.

I'm pretty overwhelmed by this offer. My debt is a pretty large stress since it doesn't allow me to save much while living in a very expensive city, and I can't believe he, and especially his parents, would be supportive of something like this. Should I take this deal? I can't shake a strong feeling of guilt. Are there unintended consequences of something like this that anyone can think of? Tax implications? How do other couples deal with one persons debt when they do get married?

Thanks to all here! You have been a tremendous help as I have tried to get my shit together the past two years with zero financial knowledge.",finance,1437401564

personalfinance,My grandparents took out a car loan on a car they can no longer afford. Should I take on this debt for them?,"Hi everyone,

This is my first time posting here so I apologize if I miss any information that would be helpful. I've read through the FAQ's and I wasn't able to find anything that completely answered my question, so I'd appreciate some outside advice on this. 

My grandparents took out a car loan about a few years ago totaling $17,751 for a 2008 Chevy Cobalt (with about $10,000 still on the loan). They got the car for my father who was going through bankruptcy and foreclosure at the time and had to move to a different state to be closer to them. At this point, neither they nor my father have the money to make the monthly payments (about $250 a month) and they have asked me and my husband to take the car and take over the payments, because we now make the most money in the immediate family.

My reaction though, is that I think this car was a horrible idea to get and I don't really want to take on these huge car payments for a car that's only worth maybe $6,000 retail value. If they had asked me or my husband about this decision at the time, we would have told them the loan was egregious and they should have tried to find a cheaper car (the car itself seems to have been about $11,000, and the fees from the loan added the extra $6,000). But, they are telling me if they can't make the car payments, the car will be repossessed but they'll still be liable for the loan payments - so it seems like our taking the car is the least bad of a bunch of not-so-great options.

My question to you all is, should we take on this car and the payments? Is there a way to settle the debt for this car by showing the loan company my grandparents have no income? Are there resources for this kind of situation?

Now the details:

**Grandparent's finances**: they are both basically living off of social security right now. They also have been taking care of my younger siblings (long story...) but their social security from my mother's death ran out this past June as the youngest turned 18. So I don't know what they bring in each month but I'm betting it's just enough to cover food and electricity. They won't share with us what their finances are really like, and honestly I feel like they don't really know themselves. (For instance, when I spoke to my grandmother about the loan a week or so ago she had no idea what the monthly payments were... even though they've been doing this for a few years).

**Dad's finances**: Also basically nothing. He lost his job at the deli a few months ago and has been doing some freelance work but has a rent of about $1000 a month, so he barely makes enough to cover that. He was making payments on the car for a little while but hasn't been able to for about a year.

**Our finances** My husband and I make about $60,000 a year before taxes. I'm a graduate student and he works in IT. However, we currently have lots of student loan and credit card debt (about 6000 CC and about 80,000 SL) because we made some poor choices in undergrad, which are coming back to bite us. So with a monthly income of about 3,600 our expenses are about:

Credit cards: 550

Student Loans: 650

Rent: 1000

Food: 500

Hulu/Netflix: 16

Health insurance (through husband's paycheck): 200

--so this leaves about 800-900 left each month, which we have been trying to save up or put toward our credit card debt. 

**Loan details** (I forgot to add these before): It seems like the loan has a 15.49% interest rate (yikes!), so the original amount financed was 17,751 (including fees+price of the car, car was 11,000). The amount still left to be paid off is $10,276, so there would be at least 41 more payments left, not including the interest rate. 

So we technically could take on this extra car payment, but I worry about the fact that a) we already have a fuckton of debt to our name, and b) the loan still has 10,000 on it, so with $250 monthly payments we will still be paying off the car for several years. This also isn't including insurance and any repairs of course, since I know that they haven't been able to take car of the car at all due to their lack of money.

So, **TL;DR: my husband and I technically have the means to take over car payments for my grandparents' underwater car loan, but it's a shitty deal and seems like it could really hurt us in the long run. But, my grandparents have no money and if the car were repossessed they would have no means to deal with the payments... and if they pass away, I worry about the debt inheritance. I'm sorry to sound like a callous granddaughter here, but ~~Do we have to~~ *should* we take over these car payments or is there another way to help out our grandparents?**",finance,1437402557

That article is from 2012 and the correlation has diverged even more significantly more since then. 

Also, [bond yields are a leading indicator of money velocity](http://www.philipji.com/item/2014-04-02/the-velocity-of-money-is-a-function-of-interest-rates). And the Fed has been talking about raising rates for the past 6 months.

So the process should be:  
Step 1: Raise rates (indicating that recent low rates/stimulus is having an effect on lending)  
Step 2: Money velocity increases further  
Step 3: Markets increase  
Step 4: Profit  

Except that the links between all of these steps have been broken for the past few years. Low rates have not pushed up money velocity, and velocity has been moving opposite the stock market.

The biggest expense has been this random lung infection I found out about, which resulted in me having to have 1/3 of my right lung removed. I will need to be on medication for at least one year that costs $800/month AFTER my insurance puts in their part.  I've been putting the pharmacy bills on my credit card every month because I basically have no other option.

personalfinance,The IRS is gonna seize my family's property unless I pay my deceased father's back taxes,"Hey All,

**TLDR: Dad's ex-wife stole a bunch of money from grandmother. Dad went into IRS debt to pay back mother. Dad dies leaving 26k in back taxes. IRS wants family property now.**


I'm at a loss on what my next step is, so any help is greatly appreciated. My father's ex-wife stole 60k, in the form of cashed checks, around 10 yrs ago from my grandmother when he had power of attorney for her family trust. So to pay back my grandmother, my father pulled everything out of his pension early and took a massive tax hit on the money. He was making payments on the money until he died last October.

My grandfather purchased some 14 acres in the [high desert of New Mexico](http://postimg.org/image/q4nv3ochv/) in the early 80's, and my father started building on it 20 yrs ago. Since he went into debt, he [stopped building](http://imgur.com/hLNDKWu). I would like to finish what he started and keep the property in the family.

Now he made his money in California but the property is in New Mexico (and he lived in Australia at the time of death) which means he owes CA state taxes as well as federal taxes. In total, he owes over 26k and the IRS keeps sending letters addressed to him (I changed his address to my house). The latest  letter said they intend to seize the land on or after Aug 2, 2015. I have sent them letters informing them of his death and have heard nothing back. Calling them is equally futile. 

I am a full time student working part time (22k/yr) with about 5k in savings, 20k in an IRA, and 20k left on a car loan. I think my options are:

1. take out another loan to pay off the IRS, but I'm wary of going so far in debt
2. Debt consolidation companies. (Do those work?)
3. Ask the internet for help, which brings us to the here and now. 

So does anybody have any ideas or suggestions? ~~I'm on the phone now with IRS trying to get an extension on that Aug 2nd date.~~ Just got off the phone and they said they cannot file an extension because I am not on his account. I need to fill out and send in form 56, which will probably take 30 days to officially be recognized, after which I'll be able to try and resolve this issue.

personalfinance,Fiancee Has $32k In Student Loans (Varying In Interest Rates) Is Paying $500/mo And We Need Help Attacking This Uphill Battle,"Hi All,

  Long time lurker, first time posting... I've seen a lot of successes in this Sub-thread and am in awe of what the Reddit community has done and I've decided to check my ego at the door and accept that I don't know as much as I like to think I do.  I've read through the commontopics and will be going through it again, but there are certain points I might need ELI5 - when talking about long term payments, accruing interest, attacking more aggressively, etc - I need a mind who knows how to take a 10,000 ft view.  


  My fiancee has a Doctorate in Physical Therapy from a great school, but unfortunately, PTs don't get paid nearly as much as they deserve - especially for what their schooling costs.  She graduated around 7 years ago and has been working to pay off her loans, but there has to be a better way to do it given that it feels like an uphill battle.  

  At the moment, she has $31,803.29 left in loans. Unfortunately they're all private loans and she can't consolidate them.  They're broken up as follows:  


Amt Left - Interest Rate - Estimated Payoff Date:  


$7,093.94 - 3% - 1/9/2021  

$7,260.24 - 4% - 5/9/2021  

$10,241.85 - 6.25% - 2/9/2022  

$7,207.26 - 8.5% - 10/9/2023  


  She pays $500/mo and we're looking at what our options are regarding paying off different ones more aggressively vs throwing maybe a large set of money at it now to cut off a lot more in interest down the road, etc.  


  She makes around $70,000/year (including 2 additional side PT jobs) and I make around $95,000/year with an average quarterly bonus of $2,500 (so ~$105,000/year).  I have one of the quarterly bonuses coming up next week so we can throw $2,500-3,500 or so right now at one of the loans (if that will help greatly in the long run?).  We are getting married in 2 months and have an account with enough to pay for the wedding and then some (honeymoon is also paid off) so we are lucky in that we do have some disposable income, which I want to aggressively use against these damn loans!  


  What I'm asking you, the Reddit Community, who have helped so many others... What would you advise here? The plan is to maintain paying at least $500/mo towards the loans - how should we split it up?  With my upcoming $2,500 bonus, is it worth it to toss at one of the loans?  If so, which one? (I'm assuming the two higher interest rate ones).  If we pay even slightly more each month on the loans, what amount increase would make a valuable difference?  


  We have at least $70k in equity on our house - would it make sense to take an Equity line?  


  Some other facts - our monthly expenses are (on average):  


$1,600/mo in mortgage
$190 car payment (3 years left)
$350 car payment (a few years left)
$190 Cell Phones ($90 of which work compensates me for)
$150 FiOS (Will be working to lower this to sub-$125)
$100 Electrical
$100 Gas
$300 Home Depot (around $3k left - 0% interest)
$20 Gym Membership  
  

  So around $3,000/mo - which isn't all that much.  We both have to drive an hour each way to work, so gas is a big expense, but aside from that, we've been really working on cutting back, as we used to go out wayyy too much - credit cards were both in excess of $1,600/each for a long time.  Aside from our going out (and ordering food in), which we've severely cut back on, we also have had a lot of wedding expenses which will likely continue until the day finally arrives.  We also have 2 dogs which factor in for various costs throughout the year (generaly several thousand dollars on vet costs, boarding, food, toys, etc).  


  Okay... so that's a lot of information... Please help - I truly appreciate any and all feedback!

personalfinance,Evaluating Company Car: Tax Implications,"My company offers company cars (including gas cards) as an option to their employees, and I am trying to evaluate it versus continuing to my personal car. The biggest unknown to me is the tax penalty, because my company miles are limited.

**The financials:**

*Current Situation*

* 2002 Nissan with 200k miles; blue book is about $2k
* Over the last year, my car has cost me about $4500 - this includes insurance (~$800), tolls (~$900), repairs (~$1500) and gas (the remainder)
* Tolls will still be my responsibility regardless
* I currently have comprehensive and collision on my car. I don't have the capital for a down-payment, so if there was catastrophic damage to it, I would need the insurance payout to finance whatever route I go.
* I am eligible for GSA mileage when I do drive for work. I'd guess I've gotten around $1k this year in mileage, but that goes straight to savings, so I don't track it in my budget
* I'd guess I drive about 10k miles a year - I can't bike to work because I live in Houston and there's no safe route. I don't drive on weekends or evenings - the sole purpose of having a car is to get to and from the office. I'd guess I have fewer than 100 miles/month that are not work-related.
* I live in Houston with no A/C, but it's going to be like $500 to get the A/C fixed because all of the lines need to be replaced and I hate spending money on cars. 

*Future Situation*

* The company deducts approximately $200/month for the privilege of using the car
* Personal miles are allowed, and there is no limit on amount or percentage
* The IRS considers commuting to be personal miles (which doesn't make sense, but whatever), so from the estimates I presented above, it's about 80% personal/20% business. 
* My options for cars are either a ford fusion or chevy impala.
* Company cars take several months to arrive once ordered, and there are ordering periods only every six months.

I know this topic has been talked about before here on PF, but I and a few questions that I was unable to find the answers to. 

Background:
I am around 80K in debt with students loans (both private and federal). I am still in school but have 3 private loans I pay the interest on. Before this year my mother paid these payment but because I have been more financially stable I have taken over the payment (and have not missed any payment this year (nor will I miss any). 

I took a look at my credit report and score just recently and found out that she had 3, 60 day late payments on those 3 loans (all from Nov. 2014). This combined with my high amount of debt has given me a extremely bad credit score.

Questions:
I understand that such a large amount of debt can cause a low score but I was wondering if there is someway to improve my score (outside the given of being good borrower)?

Over the next few years I plan on building my credit, would a secure credit card be a good option right now?

Thank you in advance for the advice,",finance,1437419942
personalfinance,401k vs Student Debt,"Hey all, just looking for some advice. I have a lot of things I'm thinking about here and I want to see what you all think.

I'm 26, just got my first ""real"" job a few months ago. $42k/year, but I live NYC so it goes fast. My employer will match half my 401k contributions up to $500/year, so I was thinking about starting a 401k but I have some concerns.

1) I still have $15.5k in student loans. $4k is at 6%+, the rest is between 4.25% and 5.5%.

2) I stay pretty current on economic trends and I see a crash coming soon, which makes me nervous to invest. 

On the one hand, I feel like I should wait until the market invariably crashes then start a 401k when assets are cheap. In the meantime, I can pay down loans and save money guaranteed by mitigating interest payments down the line. 

On the other hand, I know federal interest rates are near-zero and set to climb soon, so maybe it's better to take advantage of the steroids now and weather whatever storm is coming.

personalfinance,Trying to make the right choices and stay out of debt...Can someone have a look and give me feedback?,"Hey all, 

After slowly creeping into debt over the last 3 years, my husband and I decided we needed to do something drastic to change our lifestyle and take control. Weird how the lifestyle of mortgage/kids/suburbs can take on a momentum and life of its own if you aren't careful. 

We found ourselves in about **$13k total credit card debt (between 2 cards and PayPal credit), had no budget, and were basically just winging it**. We had $10k in savings a few years ago but that slowly diminished--unexpected daycare expenses, needing to make major purchases, and just not being careful. 

So my husband got a job in another country which pays better, offers better benefits, and provides our housing and car payment. 

**We sold our house and our cars and most of our stuff**. Here's what it looks like today:

**Credit Card Debt: $0.00** 

**Car Loan Debt: $0.00** (we paid off an $8k loan this year and purchased our other car in cash)

**Mortgage: $0.00** 

**State Pension Retirement Account: $18k** (I had to track this down as my husband started paying into it before we met and had no idea how much he was even contributing to it. **If anyone can explain this better to me, let me know in comments and I'll give more info**)

**Vanguard traditional IRA: $2k in a 2050 Target Fund** (just opened this a week ago)

**Emergency fund/future down payment fund: $15k**

**Liquid assets in checking account: $7k** 

Our plan is to try and **max out the IRA** (we currently don't have an employer match for either acct) for at least the next couple years, and I hope to set up automatic payments into the account once we move and get an idea of our actual income flow. **Did I choose a good way to invest our retirement money**? 

I opened a savings account with Barclay's because they have a 1% interest rate, and I don't want our savings to be visible to me when I log on to our main bank (USAA, online-only). **I just want the money to be there if we need it but generally be out of sight out of mind**. 

Our tentative goal is the be able to save as close to half of his salary as possible for the next 2 years, with a target savings goal in the neighborhood of $25k. Once we get settled in I will automatically transfer that money into a separate savings account also not connected to my main USAA page. 

Finally, **we will be establishing a clear budget once we start getting income flow** at the new job. I expect we will have to adjust on an as-needed basis for the first few months until we get into the swing of things. We did not have a budget before and that ran us into ""winging it"" which led to massive waste of money. 

I don't know much about finance. I don't know enough to prudently choose how to invest our money because I don't understand it beyond surface-level. That's why I chose a Target Fund. 

Finally, we want to start a 529 plan for the kids. I have done hours of research and I just can't understand or decipher the major differences between plans. **Can anyone please just suggest like 3 plans that they think are good so I am not so overwhelmed with options? I don't care about state-specific benefits, and options for family to pay into it are good**. 

Thanks for taking the time, y'all!",finance,1437422169

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

What I am primarily curious about is what order will I want to pay back these loans to be the most cost effective. Is it a good idea to consolidate some of these loans, if so which ones should I consolidate and when. I am aware that I cannot consolidate private student loans with federal ones, nor would I want to since I would lose any of the benefits from having the federal loans.

My current financial situation and budget is as follows:

*	Income after tax: 5840
*	Bills (Rent, Car payment, utility): 1815
*	Food/Gas: 500
*	Going Out: 250
*	Student Loans (Minimum): 1313.37
*	Extra/Savings: 1961.63


I have the following student loans.

Federal Loans: ($314.34) (All interest is paid)

*	Subsidized 1 $15497.82 @ 3.150%
*	Subsidized 2 $3713.70 @ 3.610%
*	Subsidized 3 $1821.78 @ 4.410%
*	Unsubsidized 1 $1403.95 @3.610%
*	Unsubsidized 2 $686.10 @ 4.410%
*	Unsubsidized 3 $7138.64 @ 6.550%



For the federal loans, mygreatlakes takes a single payment from me and distributes it accordingly to the loans. I’m not sure how to direct extra payment money towards a particular loan online, however from when I spoke with their customer service I should be able to do so from the phone. They will only direct extra money towards a loan if the minimum payment has been made.


Private Sallie Mae Student Loans

*	$35989 @ 8.5% ($354.46) (Principal: 28237)
*	$50830 @ 10.630% ($566.32) (Principal: 35342)

For the private loans I’m not sure if it is a good idea or not to consolidate the two loans. If it were a good idea, when would it be appropriate to do the consolidation? Should I wait until all of the interest is paid off, or should I try to consolidate after having made several months of payments first, or asap. 


Parent Plus Loan (All interest is paid)

* $6272.52 @ 6.41% ($78.25)

In addition I also have a car loan: 

*	$26755.51 @ 3.49%  ($388.85)

Is there a point where I should focus on paying this down over the student loans? I think that I would prefer to pay off my student loans first regardless.

I’m not sure if this last bit is relevant, but my wife and I also want to purchase a home before our current lease expires next year at the end of July. To accommodate this I ‘m going to only make minimum payments on all of the loans until the start of next year. So that we can have a larger amount in our savings to cover any costs from purchasing a home. 

To recap my questions:

* What is the best order to pay my student loans off in the most cost effective manner?
* Are there any loans I should consider consolidating?
*	If so, when should I consolidate those loans?
*	Are there any recommended tools for keeping track of the student loans and seeing what effect putting extra money in one area would have?

personalfinance,Want help to make sure I'm keeping my student loan costs as low as possible,"Okay, so I'm heading to college as a freshman this fall, and I'm (obviously) looking at options to pay for my education. I was fortunate enough to receive a full-tuition scholarship to the school I'm going to. For most this would mean their financial worries are over, however, my parents were unable to save money for me for college. I'm receiving $0 from my parents. And though my tuition is free, I still have to pay room and board. ($12,708 a year). I received $3,500 in a Federal Direct Subsidized Loan and $2,000 in unsubsidized. This leaves me with $8,188 in remaining direct costs that I'm responsible for.

Now, the federal financial aid website requires you to take an entrance counseling session online. In that online session, it automatically adds on a little over $2,000 as an estimate of other indirect costs you'll incur in college. So the federal financial aid website says I'll have about $11,000 that I'll need to be responsible for for the upcoming school year. Now for my questions:

I'm assuming that the ~$11,000 I'm responsible for this year has to be taken out in private student loans, right? Is there any way I can get more low-cost federal loans? Should I borrow the $8,000 number stated in my financial aid package that doesn't take into account indirect costs or take out the $11,000 from the federal financial aid website that does? If I'm taking out a private loan, should I multiply the number I'll need or this year by 4 and take it out for all four years? Or should I be taking out just enough for this year and take out another one next year? Any recommendations for private student loan lenders?

Forex,[FA] RBNZ this Thursday,"As i'm sure most of you are aware, the RBNZ OCR decision is this Thursday.  We won't get too much depth as far as the forecasts the RBNZ are using as it's not a Monetary policy statement.

A 25bp is completely priced in, with a 12% chance of a 50bp priced in (as far as OIS goes).  another 25bp cut in September is completely priced in too, while the October meeting has a 51% chance of a 25bp cut.  

Given how much is priced in as far as IR markets go, unless we get very dovish comments out from the RB, a 25bp cut might not see a particularly large reaction.  of course a 50bp cut would see a sharp slide, but this is an outside possibility at the moment.  most banks are looking at 25bp at each of the next 3 meetings.

of course resistance at 66 cents looks to be a good entry, but with the USD starting to look at touch stretched NZDUSD might not be the best bang for your buck.

another good way to possibly get positioned for this is via AUDNZD as it is highly sensitive to interest rate differentials, but with RBA minutes this afternoon and CPI tomrrow there are risks ... but the RBA has already been cutting and there is very little priced in as far as cuts go at the moment, and the previous cuts should be starting to support inflation a bit more by now.  iron ore prices are always a worry, as is general commodity weakness, but this story is nothing new and will have been a large part of the RBA's thinking for some time.  November IBs (30-day bills) are basically showing a 50% change of a 25bp cut by November. 1.12 looks like an ok entry on the shorter (hourly) timeframes, but 1.10 is the big line in the sand.  looking to accumulate between 1.12 - 1.10 looks like the play, while a break and close above 1.14 would confirm the next leg higher.

personalfinance,"[USA, 25M] Where do I place 18k of savings each year.","^(Using a throwaway because my friends know my account name.)

I am 25 and I am able to save about 25k a year with my new job after 401k, taxes and general spending. This does not include my emergency fund. With the EF, I'd have about 18k to put away each year. 

The options I've thought of:

* Open a new bank account with Ally or another and take advantage of a near 1% APY

 * Currently at 0.01%

* Open a Brokerage / IRA account and invest it.
 * This could also include a stock market contribution where I invest maybe 1% of my savings into stocks of my choosing rather than a diversified portfolio. This would be money I'd be okay with losing.

I like the idea of having this money extremely liquid in case I need it but I find the higher returns of an IRA appealing. At the same time my end goal is to eventually buy a cheap home with a nice down payment and I don't think the IRA/Brokerage would be a wise short-term investment. Would it make sense to open both? Switch banks to get a better interest rate on the 7k and invest the 18k? Since this would be a yearly thing, my EF would increase by ~7k each year and my other portion with what's left over. After 4 years I'd have 28k in my EF and may put size that back down to 7k - or whatever 6 months of expenses equates to then. Is this a weird way to go about this? Should I focus on having a fixed amount in my EF rather than building it up 6 months at a time every year?

My reasoning for a gradually larger EF is that I don't want to be surprised with a big hit at some point. I can realistically set aside 7k each year and survive for 6 months. Say at some point I have something that requires more than 7k. Sure, I could sell some stock and do pay with that but using the money in my EF sounds like a cleaner option when it tax season comes around. Maybe multiple EF's? One for living expenses another for bills? Like for car repair or medical work? If that's what I did, after two years I'd have 28K+ each year to lump with the savings.

I thought it would be fine as long as I work hard and pay interests. But it will take forever to get debt-free. So I changed my mind and I am ready to start debt clearing. 

Trimming my expenses, I will be able to save $800 a month. I will start with 15K at 8% interest first, but I have few questions first: 

1. Should I cash out lump sum from saving accounts to pay off debt? If so, which saving accounts should I withdraw first? Or should I pay off in installments?

2. I still need my emergency fund around $6000. Which of saving accounts should I keep?",finance,1437438491

personalfinance,Student Loans: Advice on Payment plans and consolidation situation including Parent Plus,"Okay, so its my first time posting, my roommate really thought this might be beneficial for me. Thanks in advance.

So I graduated in 2013, and have 2 main loan lender. Nelnet and Greatlakes (I didnt see any ""no naming names"" in the rules so hopefully thats fine)

I am paying both off myself, and loan payments are pretty much hitting $780.50 a month. Which is kinda high, and its choking me on everything else. I am in the art field, so it does stink...kinda.

The problem is, the Greatlakes loan is NOT under my name, I wrongfully (I should have read closer) assumed that after graduation the Parent Plus loan would become mine. Well it didnt, and now its like there is another loan, not in my name that I am paying. Well on my tax return I am credited for this payment, we worked it out so that it helps me out in the interest I paid. But my question is is it possible to reconsolidate OR would it even be wise to do that? Since consolidation CAN lower payments and interest, but at the same time one of the loans is not in my name.

I just moved both of the loans (with the help of my mom for verification purposes on GL) from the Standard repayment plan to the Graduated Plan. I know that in the long run, the interest is higher on the Graduated, but my thought process is that by lowering the payments, I could potentially keep the same amount that I am paying right now and attack the ""smaller"" loans with high interest rates.

As of right now I owe to Nelnet $24,880 and GL $34,620

My payments were Nelnet $302 + GL $477 but under the Graduated plan the payments should be Nelnet $ 200ish and GL $365

I am open to ideas and thoughts on the BEST way to attack these loans and get them out of my hair for a while. I will admit I am not the best at budgeting, but I have been looking at the subreddits for that as well and asking friends their thoughts. If there is a for sure game plan that I could follow or just thought process I would love the knowledge anyone would lend. 

Mainly I am just curious if it is possible for consolidation, or if I chose the best path for me, or if I need to rethink my process.

Oh, and I am roughly bringing in $1250 twice a month (sorry, I had to fix that. every 2 weeks I am bring in $1250ish). I am an artist so go easy on me. I am still figuring all this mess out. And school was expensive.

Thank you again in advance, hopefully this doesn't completely fall on deaf ears

personalfinance,Retirement Choices For Newlyweds,"Could we get some advice about our situation? I've recently moved jobs, we purchased a new house this year, and are getting married in a few weeks so many things have been in flux this year. Due to the wedding and the house I've been hoarding cash to make sure we have a huge e-fund in case of catastrophe or wedding chaos, but now that everything is coming back to normal (and wedding expenses are definitely covered) I'd love some input for planning out a good retirement situation for us going forward. I've read through the FAQ a few times, looking for any personalized feedback people may have.

We seem to be in good shape, are fortunate in our careers and have been budgeting pretty consistently within our means. My questions mostly revolve around choosing retirement accounts, how much to put where, and which direction to go going forward.

***Details***

**Personal**

* Both 27 years
* $180k annual combined income (and rising, as my partner is underpaid for their position in a hot market and I'm hoping for merit increases going forward).
* Monthly non-mortgage expenditures are ~$2-3k, not currently investing any savings, all in cash.
* Paying for the wedding ourselves, so our saving has been ~$1k/month instead of the more desired $2-3k. Should come back to normal thanks to just paying off final student loans and the wedding being over &amp; paid for.
* No debts outside of the mortgage, our car is owned, no monthly balances on CC (put as many things on CC as possible to get points &amp; companion passes, pay off in full)

**Mortgage**

* 10 year ARM @ 3.2%
* $3k/month, of which $250 is PMI
* We put only 10% down to focus on cash hoarding, and plan to make a lump 10-15k extra principal payment each year until PMI is paid (est 6 years with the standard payment, hope to do it in 3), since that seems to me to be similar to a ""higher interest loan"" that we can pay off and stop throwing away $3k/year.

**Savings/E-Fund &amp; Debts**

* $70k in cash accounts for shared &amp; personal checking/savings, big E-Fund &amp; wedding expenses fund. Can break out further if necessary. $30k of that is a money market account which I brought out in cash purely for house/wedding emergencies (to make sure that if we need a new roof, a new engine in the car and we lose our jobs we can still get married). After the wedding I plan to put it back into an investment account, or potentially use it to seed IRAs for us before the end of this year (see questions at the end, no clue about where to put it).
* Personal investment account w/ $40k, half stock half ETF.

**Retirement**

* 401(k) from previous job with $32k, 100% invested in Target 2050 fund in a Fidelity account
* My current job is opening up a 401(k) with multiple good Vanguard options, but without any matching (work for a successful startup).
* My fiancee is waiting to figure this out after the wedding, but will likely be making 
* No IRAs currently opened, since I mostly just did max matching contribution and put the rest in a big bucket. I've only very recently taken the time to try to understand the retirement side of things.

**Questions**

* *What should I do with my old 401(k)?* I'm currently planning to roll it into my new company's 401(k). The adviser my company hired for 401(k) consultations recommended a traditional IRA. What are the pro/con of putting it into the new 401(k)? However, putting into a traditional IRA would make the next one harder...
* *Should I focus on growing a Roth IRA through ""backdoor conversion""?* With our income level being what it is, we're right at the limit for contributing to an IRA and will likely surpass it next year. I've spoken with a co-worker who is a big proponent of the backdoor Roth IRA conversion, which seems like a good thing to do. However, the backdoor conversion is only effective if ALL accounts are Roth, as the conversion is proportional to the amount that's pre-tax across all IRA's. This would mean I shouldn't roll over my 401(k) into a traditional IRA? Or don't use backdoor conversions, which means that we can't use IRAs (I think?).
* *Should I focus on traditional or Roth accounts?* The backdoor conversion is only a question if I want to grow post-tax money, and I'm guessing we should focus on one or the other. Part of me thinks Traditional, since the money I would pay to taxes now could be used as principal for 40 years, which is then taxed as income on withdrawal, giving me free gains on the taxed portion (if I understand the withdrawal tax correctly). The other part of me wonders if taxes will be much higher later, and so I should put into a Roth. Everything I've seen about the subject has been on the level of ""Well, how do you feel about the strength of the bond markets or future tax increases?"" which feels like a hunch. Anyone have real experience here, or what are your opinions on the matter?
* *Should I max out retirement accounts before paying down our mortgage's PMI?* I've been treating PMI like a higher interest debt, since it increases the effective interest rate of our mortgage above 3.2% (though probably only like 3.5%). In planning, I've been assuming that a $10-15k payment towards the loan should be a focus for us, but that's mostly because I don't like having debts very much.

Thank you for the time! There are too many options with so many choices, I'm struggling to sort it all out. We've been very fortunate, and have gotten our financial house in order in large part thanks to me constantly stalking /r/personalfinance so thanks!",finance,1437440076
personalfinance,Paying for a summer class with a credit card.,"Hello all, 

I am 20 years old with little history, a credit score of 708-730 according to credit karma, and am currently attending college. My current situation is that I took a summer class at a different college and am trying to have my parents cosign on as little as possible and am trying to avoid getting a loan for this class as it is only $991. I was just approved for a Discover-it card and was planning on using that to pay for the class and pay it off while working my part time job during school and not using that card for anything else until that class was paid off. The card has a 0% interest rate for the first 6 months and I would be able to pay off the class in full by then. The idea behind this was that I would be building up my credit as well as elevating financial stress on my parents (who were going to put it on their credit card and have me make the payments anyway.). So is my plan plausible and are there any hurdles that I do not know about? This is the first big financial endeavor that I am going on by myself so I have little to no experience as to what I am doing.

The specific page is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Benefit_Transfer And the page says ""It is illegal for anyone to charge sales tax, surcharges or card processing fees from an EBT SNAP account, according to federal law and USDA SNAP Guidelines.""

personalfinance,"I have college tuition to pay. Help, what are my options?","So I'm entering sophomore year in university; entering the university I had qualified for full tuition paid, as long as I maintained a GPA of above a 3.0. Now, being young and dumb gave me a sense of invincibility and after freshman year I ended up with a sad GPA of 2.87, which I'm sure I can somewhat recover if I actually worked (which I will, lesson learned). Of course, I've given a false transcript to my parents because I would sooner kill myself (not literally but kind of) than let them see my real GPA. Plan is to work my ass off until I can transfer to a better school, then parents can take over the tuition from there.

Here's the problem. My tuition is $5804 for this semester, due on 7/29, or I can choose a payment plan to pay 1/3($1934.6) now(aka before 7/29), 1/3 on 9/23, and 1/3 on 10/21. My parents give me roughly 7K a semester to cover rent(around $600/mo) and living expenses in general, and I have around 1.5k saved up from a summer job so the first payment won't be a problem. But how can I get a student loan without my parents finding out to pay the rest of this semester and next? I know that with fafsa you have to fill out 2014 tax returns, and I can only find 2013's (not to mention they'd be for next semster at the soonest if they went through). I'm too scared to even put my address on there in case they mail me because my parents open my mail without my permission. Is my only choice private lenders with high interest rates (provided they'd even lend to me as I don't have a credit score at all)? Or P2P lending(again, credit issue)? Or seekingarrangement(I don't know how this works but I know some people use this to pay off college loans and I would really rather not)?

My SO will have an outstanding 140k in student loan debts (all Federal, but most Parent PLUS that he is responsible for) when he graduates. While I know that these debts should be paid off immediately and ASAP, as bad as it sounds, there is a part of me that hates spending this large sum on a debt that I never created.

Is is better to spend the sum, when I receive it, to pay off my spouses debts or invest the money and use the yearly investments to slowly pay off the debt over time? (and theoretically keep the 120k in investments to be used for retirement, buying a house, etc.) 

EDIT: We are engaged, would be married by the time that I would receive the inheritance. We decided that we did not want to maintain separate financial accounts when we are married- as in we will combine each of our incomes and spend together. We are both fiscally responsible and frugal, he just collected a lot of debt through student loans that he was mislead to believe would be paid off by his parents. But I digress- I guess my question is: Is it better to pay off all 120k into the debts right when I get it and prevent interest, or invest the 120k and add the (lets be conservative and say 12k/year) money from this investment to paying off the debt. Right now, he is paying 250/month towards his loans, and when we are married we will up it to 500/month. So we would be paying off the 140k in debts at a rate of 20k/year. The interest rate on his debt averages out to around 7.25%",finance,1437485871

I have a newly built home, reasonably energy efficient home, and the largest section of my roof faces almost perfectly South.

33x Kyocera KD-200-60 F panels with Enphase M215 microinverters, system size is 8.745 kW and annual production estimate of 8838 kWh, 101% solar offset and $1046/yr utility savings

Total cost is $30,900 after discounts.  There is also a NY incentive discount of $5247, NY tax credit of $5000, and a federal tax credit of $7700.  Net system price is $12,900, $3.53/kW, and RoI of 12 years.

I would probably finance 100% of the costs.  The tax credit would be financed at 0% and payable when I file my taxes.  The remaining portion of $12,900 would be financed at 3.5% for 15 years.  

The price seems on the high side and the RoI is borderline low imo.  I have and am currently doing my own research, but I would like opinions from those with experience.  Are the panels and micro inverters quality components?  Is Direct Energy Solar (Astrum) a reputable company?  What is your opinion of the payback period?

personalfinance,Life events are piling up: How can we plan for all of these expenses at once?,"For a few years, my now-fiancee and I have planned to relocate from out east coast lawyer jobs to other law jobs out west. We’re now at the point where the transition is getting very real. Unfortunately, a number of other goals/situations with financial implications have been cropping up at the same time and it’s causing both of us a tremendous amount of stress. We’re hoping the wise minds of /r/personalfinance can help with some guidance. 

We’re looking for input on how we can best prepare for and successfully execute all of the various things we’d like to do over the next year without hamstringing our long-term financial health.

**The following are the big expenses we anticipate and are trying to plan for:** (1) paying for our wedding; (2) buying a house (including associated closing costs, etc.); (3) buying a second car; and (4) just generally being able to afford the move out west.

* **A few basic facts about us:** I have a significant amount of law school debt that I am currently paying off. In my current job, I spend around 40% of my salary on loan payments. By the end of the year, my debt should be below 100k. I recently re-refinanced in order to bring down both my interest rate and monthly payments, at the expense of re-starting the ten-year clock. I also have less cash on hand (~15k), partially because of my aggressive loan payments and partially from buying the engagement ring. I do, however, have a brokerage account with ~50k of stock in it. She has no loan debt and more cash on hand (~40k). I own a used car outright; I finished paying it off about a year ago. We both max out our IRA and 401(k) contributions annually.

* **We’re planning to get married next year.** Her family gave us a not insignificant amount to help with the wedding and my parents anticipate chipping in as well. That being said, we’re still planning to put in ~8-12k of our own money. Most of the big contracts have already been signed and we’re really skimping on a number of aspects of the wedding to cut costs (e.g., decorations, flowers, food, rehearsal, etc.). However, we’re getting married in a destination-type place and we’re splurging on a few aspects of the wedding that are especially important to us (e.g., photographer). **Aside from just socking away cash, what are some other ways to prepare for or minimize our wedding expenses?**

* **We want to buy a house.** As a preliminary matter, we’re trying to determine whether we should try and buy a house as soon as we get out west or whether we should wait and feel out the area. On the one hand, I’m tired of moving (I’ve moved 3 times in the last 4 years) and I think—given the projected movement of interest rates and property prices—buying a house isn’t going to get any cheaper. We would also save on the costs associated with moving multiple times.  On the other hand, we want to get the right house, not just the first one we can find. We could possibly get a very small, short-term apartment and put furniture in storage during this time period in order to save extra cash for a down payment while researching possible neighborhoods.

* As for financing the house, it’s not clear where we’ll stand when the time comes. She has saved quite a bit of cash over the last two years; I have considerably less, though I do have stocks I could sell. The specific companies I’m holding are (I believe) set to keep growing, however, so I’d prefer to not sell these. I can if necessary, of course. Our parents will both contribute, but we don’t know by how much. (Realistically, I’d estimate we can get a ~20k gift from my family and a low-interest family loan of around ~5-15k from her family.) As such, we’re looking at houses in the 300s or low 400s, though we’d ideally like to get something in the mid-to-high 400s. I’ve used some mortgage calculators and I think we can manage a mortgage for these kinds of houses, but I’m not 100% sure. It’s the down payment that is the hardest part for us to deal with. **Any advice on how to search for houses, how to plan for and approach the purchase, and how to prepare for the costs of home ownership? Any indications of what sort of price range we should be considering? Should we chat with a real estate agent to get a sense of neighborhoods and anticipated prices? Is it better to chat with a real estate agent we know personally or one we don’t know at all?**

* **We will need a second car.** I don’t see this as too large a challenge given that we can probably get reasonably good financing on a used 4WD vehicle (we’re moving somewhere mountainous). The biggest headache here is that everything I’ve read on PF suggests we should avoid adding auto financing to our credit reports too close in time to mortgage hunting. **Is this true? How can we approach the car purchase without damaging our house prospects?**

* **General points related to the move out west.** There are a few other variables that have contributed to our overall financial stress levels.  First, my fiancée has a terminally ill pet that she is very close to and we recently funded one last round of treatment in an attempt to give her some extra time. It was not cheap, but it was paid for with cash on hand. 

* Second, my fiancee’s current job comes with a very substantial bonus at the end of the year. However, she has a job offer on the table in a prestigious, but low-paying government position. It’s a job offer she plans to accept. The problem is, the new job wants her to start before the end of the year, meaning we’ll be deprived of that very substantial bonus. We’re hoping the OPM hack slows down background checks and that we can drag out the process in other ways, but I’m not getting my hopes up. For purposes of our calculations, I’m assuming she won’t be around to get her bonus. She may still get a payout from unused paid vacation days, however. Every little bit counts. Any tips for getting a later start date with a government agency or otherwise improving the process?

* Third, I’m still sorting out my job prospects, but it’s possible that I could end up in a position that includes a signing bonus and/or reimbursements for moving expenses. These would both be extremely helpful, but there’s nothing definitive on the table just yet.  Given our looming cash crunch, I’m inclined to find such a job just to help the transition.

**TL;DR** East coast lawyer couple is preparing to move out west. A confluence of major life events (wedding, house, car, relocation) are causing a looming cash crunch and we’re trying to plan responsibly.",finance,1437489902
personalfinance,Help understanding Student Loans and Interest why are they different every month ?,"Interest always bothers me and I always have trouble figuring it out. I understand the basics, but when you take out a loan, you are charged interest, that is added up to the amount of principle over the loan repayment period and you get your monthly payments.  I think generally ??

So I do not understand why it says accrued interest on my student payments, and why my interest payments and principal payments would be different every month.  They should be going up in principal payments and down in interest payments.  What do I not understand here ??

I have payoff dates, is that going to change based on when I am paying these bills ??

It seems like the earlier in the month I pay I remove interest ?? Or is this some type of extra interest that's being applied ? I have a monthly due date of the 12th I believe with a grace period of a few days. 

Here is an example sorry for the crappy formatting :

So you can see above my interest on 4/15 was 249 and on 5/18 was 290

It seems like if I pay on the 1st every month instead of the actual due date I remove interest? Will this increase when my payoff date is ? I feel like this can't make any sense.

personalfinance,Moved back to US after 15 years in Australia; need some advice on how to manage my savings.,"I've been in Australia from the age of 7 and have just moved back to the US at the age of 23 and I plan to stay here indefinitely (I have dual citizenship in AU and the US).

After paying for flights and a variety of expenses, I still have about $5,000AUD in my Australian account and will be receiving a further ~$2,500 in the next couple of months or so from owings and such. I am currently working a 3 month temp job in Maine, at the end of which, I will most likely have saved somewhere between $4,000USD and $4,500.

My issue is that I didn't transfer my Australian money over right away as I figured I wouldn't be needing it all for now and the savings interest rates seem to be better in Australia. Unfortunately, however, the currency transfer rate between AUD and USD is getting worse and worse and I don't know whether to hold out and hope it swings back up, or if I should bite the bullet and bring my money over now. It's already at the point where the full ~$7,500AUD will only get me about $5,100USD.

personalfinance,Student Loans vs Mortgage Downpayments,"My husband and I are beginning to plan to buy our first house in the next year or two. Our combined annual income is $170K, and we have about $80K in non-emergency savings / mutual funds. He also has about $13K in student debt at a 2.3% interest rate ($140/mo payment; so far we haven't just fully paid off the student debt because the mutual fund interest is vastly outpacing it.) We both have 800+ credit scores.

I've been playing around with mortgage calculators and it seems like if we want to buy this year (which is pretty desirable for us personally), then we are mostly hurting for downpayment. It seems obviously better to put $13K towards the downpayment on the 4% mortgage than finishing off the 2% student loans.

She has a car loan that we are currently paying an extra $100 a payment on to pay it off sooner. She owes about 10k. After that, it will be her school loans, which is about 6k. Currently paying the minimum on that since it has a lower interest rate than the car. I have a $50k school loan, but it is to family, so it doesnt have interest. We pay off our CC bills each month. 


We want to start saving money to put into an account to save for kids and an account to live off of in case one or both of us loses our job.

They are all subsidized loans sitting in the 6 month grace period - 3 out of the 4 are still accruing interest. I feel financially comfortable at this point to pay them off immediately to stop the interest from piling up. Here's the breakout:

Loan A:   Principle Balance: $3,000 
              Interest Rate: 4.6%

I plan on waiting to pay off Loan A until the 12/1/15 due date simply because it is no accruing interest. I'd like to pay off Loans B,C,D immediately. That being said - I'm trying to come up with the best game plan to do so. Would it be unwise to put these loans on a cash back credit card and pay the balance immediately to receive the cashback/points? Is there a card I should use? Is this a bad idea?

personalfinance,"95% of my portfolio is in Google, Apple, and Amazon, which I've accumulated religiously since I graduated college in 2009. Should I rebalance?","Since I graduated college in 2009, I've accumulated Google and Apple stock in my brokerage account (~$250k value) and Amazon stock in my Roth IRA (~$100k value) by living dirt cheap and taking public transportation despite my above-average income.  I also have a little bit of SPY in each.  Is this OK?  Even though I'm young, is it still bad that all of my net worth is in three stocks?  Apple's big hit today made me think.

Should I rebalance?  I'm worried that the valuations of these three stocks (Google, Amazon, and Apple) are getting way too frothy, and I should consider taking some of the profits I've accumulated over the past 6 years, spreading some more into SPY, picking up some lower-beta stocks or ETFs, and setting aside a bit of cash in case of market correction.

Thoughts?  What would you do if you were me, considering my young age (26 years old) and the fact that my fiance's parents (very successful business owners) are going to pay for our wedding and have already put a down payment on a house for us (i.e., no major near-term purchases)?  In terms of liabilities, I don't have any credit card debt, and I recently refinanced my $20k of student loans down to a 2% interest rate (I always made the minimum payments so that I could invest in stocks).  My fiance has no debt (rich parents).

personalfinance,TurboTax is so awful! WTF! There's got to be a better way?!?!,"Okay so I used TurboTax to file my Federal income tax return online for free.  No issues, smooth sailing.

But then when it came to the State income taxes, it's now making me want to rip my hair out.

I work in two states, and so I need to file for both states.  I downloaded 2 copies of TurboTax on two different devices, thinking I could take advantage of the Free State e-filing on each device, so I could get both states e-filed for free.

NO SUCH LUCK.

I had to file a Non-resident tax form for one of the states, and for some reason, TurboTax kept insisting on charging me for that non-resident state, even though I had selected that state as my Free State option.  UGH!

So I ended up having to mail the refunds instead of e-filing, to avoid the fees.  I already received one state's refund, but it's been 14 weeks, and I still have not received the other state's refund.

I emailed them to ask what the issue is, and they state they never received it.  So I decided now to see if I can e-File for that one state.  I tried messing around for almost an hour with regedit and the Intuit registry and the whatnot so I could keep trying to choose that state as my Free state, but to no avail.  

Finally, I gave up and decided to just pay the $24.99 for that state (even though I had chosen that state as MY FREE STATE!).  
So I get a confirmation that my credit card was charged for e-filing for that state. 

But Lo and behold, when I go to click Transmit, TurboTax tells me that there is already a form on file with my social security number, and I cannot e-File a duplicate return.  

WTF??!!  And now, I checked my credit card, and I was charged that $24.99, and the e-filing didn't even go through!!

I'm gonna have to mail the paper printout of the tax forms instead, to ensure the state gets the forms.  And it's gonna be a 6-8 week processing time!  It's already been 14 weeks since I initially filed, and I was expecting my refund back in early June!

WTF??!!  Why does Turbo Tax suck so much?  They had better refund me back that $24.99 because I'm mailing the forms instead of e-filing.  Should I call Turbo Tax to have them double check that the state Comptroller's office received my forms in the mail, rather than electronically and would they give me a refund?

There's got to be a better way than shitty TurboTax.

I've had a credit account through Bank of America since the early 2000's that saw me through my terrible 20's where I just abused it.  It was set at 3,000 at an ungodly 29% for a while now, where I've had bouts of charging and paying it off since about 2010 or so.  No late payments since at least 2008, so I've definitely improved on that.

However, I've always felt scared of the damage I did when I was younger.  On a whim, I signed up for a new card through BoA, and was shocked at the interest rate and limit I was given.  Also, the limit on the other card was boosted too, it might have happened earlier, I have no documentation other than statements that it was increased, but it has.

personalfinance,"Recently graduated college 22 y/o, 23.5K debt, 22K income, 643 credit","Hi PF, long time lurker here, asking for some advice. I will give a little of background so please bear with me...


Currently making ~850 - 1000 per bi-weekly pay check, post tax and trying to transfer into a department which would be paying $65K pre tax.


$4000 in cash, $6500 vehicle, currently maxing 401K with employee matching 2:1


Background on my family:

Mom, dad, and brother all work. We have been in a financial rut for a long time now (5+ years, and it has taken a huge toll on the entire family.) Putting me through college, and now my brother as well is very tough. We barely get by every month and I am starting to worry about my parents’ retirement (61 y/o and 59 y/o).


List of estimated expenses: (First time looking at my Amex spending details, it is eye opening for me)

$400/mo rent (I don’t pay for utilities nor phone bill, this is included in the 400)

$200-300 gas (Driving is a major hobby for me, looks like I’ll be cutting down big time)

$250-300 food (Both groceries and restaurants combined)

$120 Car Insurance

$200 going out/clothes/internet purchases

$45 gym membership


At the end of every month I’m lucky to have saved much. Tonight, after thinking about my financial situation I realized I am spending way too much on food, gas, etc. And that is why I am here to try and get some help. My goal is to cut gas down to $100-150/mo, food down to $200 and eventually even further. Downgrading my gym membership to a $20/mo facility as well. 


I recently checked my credit score and was shocked to see the number had tanked from 735 to 643... After using AnnualCreditReport, I see that there was 3 negative/late payments noted on my account. This was surprising to me because I always make my payments on time. Then I remembered when my family moved apartments my dad asked me to put two bills in my name (AT&amp;T UVerse and DirectTV Bundle.) After AT&amp;T installed our internet (We were paying for 30MBPS) the installation guy said due to our location the fastest our internet would go was 0.5 MBPS which was completely unacceptable. We immediately called to cancel the same day. My dad has a terrible temper if any customer service rep gives him any lip and cursing and yelling ensued. He said he had handled everything and not to worry but apparently not... My dad usually gets his way with these types of things, we had the names of everyone we spoke to, employee ID #'s and everything (this was over 4 months ago though I doubt I could find this paper). 


After seeing what this has done to my credit, I will no longer trust anyone with my credit, not even my family. The third negative mark on my report was one late payment because I used an old credit card which I had completely forgotten about.... and it wasn't until 2 months later that I got an email saying my balance was past due.... Is there anything I can do to fix my credit?


My dad also promised to pay off my college debt, but I’m starting to see that he’s full of shit. My parents borrow money from me on a monthly basis ($100-400) which I assumed I’m never getting any of it back. During a very rough period I have given my parents collectively over $5500, which my dad claims to have already paid back, yet everyone else in the family knows he hasn’t. My parents are always being very rude and demanding of me, which is making me resent them after I have given them so much help financially.

 
Some questions I have off the top of my head: 


How can I fix my credit?


Should I stop maxing 401K and focus on paying off my debt?


Do you think it is necessary to downgrade my vehicle? (2004 Bmw 330i ZHP) It is my pride and joy, and driving and working on my car is one of my few hobbies.. the difference in monthly insurance would maybe save me $20/mo and gas maybe $60/mo.

 
What is the best way to tackle my debt? Small payments? Or should I just dump $3000 out of my $4000 cash on it ASAP? Are there any federal volunteer programs that I can do to reduce my debt, while still working my job?


How do I talk about this with my parents in a gentle nature? They seem to be under the impression that they are doing everything right, and their problems are not their own fault.


What is an easy way to record my purchases, preferably automatic and not needing to manually enter every purchase into an app? American Express mixes up a lot of items into the wrong categories (ex: Costco gas goes under retail)


I currently work ~45 hours a week, do you think I should pick up a second job? This would put a lot of strain on me and my gf.

I would rather own more high-quality corporate bonds than treasuries due to higher yield for reasonable risk. Something like VCIT or VCLT make more sense for that. Should I consider trading them out? 


Things on my mind include:

* Interest rate risk: intermediate or long term should be safer that short term in a buy and hold forever situation given the inevitable rate rise. Is that correct? Priced in?
* Correlation with stock market: don't necessarily want it in my bond fund.
* Some unknown blind spot.

I bought the house in 2005 with my then girlfriend at the peak of the housing bubble. Then the market tanked. Then my relationship tanked. She moved out, and I've been living there ever since, paying the mortgage on time every month. Eventually I met someone else and got married. We want to stay in this house, but the ex is still on the mortgage and the home loan (which is how we financed the house originally). 

I had the house appraised a couple of years ago, trying to refinance under just my income, but the appraisal was about $15k shy of where the bank needed it to be. My understanding is that I would have to pay that $15k out of pocket, which didn't (and don't) have. The home values in my hood have gone up some since then, plus we have a new roof and new tile in the kitchen since the appraisal. We are looking to lower our monthly payment and plan on being in the house for at least another 5 years, probably longer. 

My question is a two-parter: A) What do we need to do to remove my ex and add my wife? B) What is a better option: a loan with a slightly higher interest rate but no closing costs, or a loan with a slightly lower interest rate but significant closing costs (~$6K).

investing,"Pay off student loans, or invest/trade?","My default answer is obviously pay off student loans first. 

However, a lot of people say that they understand the risk, and when it comes to it it, on average, if trading gives you better returns than your loan interest rate, you should in fact trade (that's a misleading simplification but its true).

Anyway, I just wanted to share that as of last week, I have officially paid off my graduate student loans with my graduate student loans. This is because I was taking out the max, around $10,000 a semester but only using about $5,000 toward school and using the rest to invest (theoretically I suppose I used it as living expenses and used my regular income to invest). Anyway, I more or less doubled my loan refund money through trading over the past two years and used it to pay off my balance entirely. Meaning I went to grad school for free essentially (not really since I put a lot of work and time into trading). 

So it is possible... Also, I do claim to know what I am doing but also realize that a lot of luck was involved given some uncharacteristic returns; my YTD return this year is around 85% and last years returns were around 28%.

Summary of our situation:

- I am a current 4th year dental student that will graduate in May, 2016.  

- My wife is a dentist who graduated last year and is currently in a 3 year residency program making $50k/year.

- I will have ~$250k in dental school student loan debt upon graduation, my wife currently has ~320k in dental school student loan debt that is in deferment.  So let’s call total student loan debt ~600k.

- All loans are Federal Direct Med/Dent, Federal Direct Grad PLUS, or Federal Health Professions Student Loans.  They are all unsubsidized and interest rates vary between 5.4% and 8% (kill me).

- My initial expected salary in July, 2016 will be something like ~130k and should increase steadily over the years.

- My wife will have a salary jump sometime around July, 2018 to something like ~190k which should also increase steadily over the years.

- No house, no kids, no pets, no CC or other consumer debt.

- I purchased YNAB a few months ago and we have been using it diligently to cut expenses and get on a realistic budget for our non-existent incomes

- We are both debt averse and know the challenge before us of paying off student loans.  I don’t anticipate doing PAYE or IBR or any of those programs, our plan now is to buckle down and as soon as we are both working A) try to refinance to better rates and B) pay 7k-10k per month on our highest interest rate loans and work down from there.

- Once we both have serious incomes I will definitely be speaking with a financial advisor, but I am curious about steps within the next few years.

- I have begun to read a lot of this forum and Bogleheads and White Coat investor stuff to try to get a grip on the smartest way to tackle our situation but still have some specific questions.

Specific questions:

1) Should we max Roth IRA’s for the next few years while we are still eligible?  I have read a lot about the “Pay off loans vs. invest in retirement debate” but it still seems like a wash for loans in the 5-8% range.  As soon as we have more income we will plan on doing both (maxing tax sheltered retirement funds and paying loans aggressively) but for now when we only have the income to prioritize one or the other, any advice?  Investing in a retirement account also has some value from a “good habit building” standpoint, especially for my wife who has never had a real job before, but I am not sure how to quantify it.

2) I am confused as hell about Backdoor Roth IRAs and conversion ladders.  Anyone have good links to help clarify these to me?  Pretend you are trying to explain it to a golden retriever.

3) I am confused about Traditional IRA vs Roth IRA.  I know the traditional IRA is betting that my tax bracket in retirement will be lower than it is during my contributions (no tax now, pay later), and Roth IRA seems to be the opposite.  How can I have any idea of what my tax bracket will be in retirement to prioritize one or the other?

4) I worked at a company for 8 months before dental school and stashed away cash in a Fidelity 401k that is now worth ~$11k (vested balance $9.8k).  I haven’t worked for that company or contributed in 3 years.  What does the vested balance mean?  Should I roll this over to Vanguard for lower fees or anything if that is where I am planning on opening my retirement accounts?

I will not be making any significant headway with this loan in the immediate future. I plan on paying the installment amount plus a few hundred extra if I go with the 10 year option.

personalfinance,"Update: Dad With Alzheimer's, Mom Makes $8.00/hr, Just Lost Insurance, etc.","Hi /r/personalfinance, I posted in April about my family's dire financial situation brought on by my father's Alzheimer's diagnosis and the other hardships we have undergone since his layoff in 2013.  A lot has happened since then, and I thought the community deserved an update.  Before I begin, I would like to thank all of those who commented and upvoted my post.  Thanks to your input it reached the front page of PF and received a great deal of visibility, and I was able to receive some great suggestions.  My family was humbled by your outpouring of support.

First, I'll address the primary issues that brought me to this subreddit seeking advice: our loss of health insurance and our pending loss of food stamps.  We understood that when my Dad's disability case was approved, he would lose his food stamp money.

1.  The relationship between the Health Care Marketplace and individual insurance companies in Alabama is strained at best, and as /u/nuovo_donna pointed out, many of our problems stem from Alabama's refusal to take the Medicare expansion plan, which I educated myself on after making this post.  Nonetheless, I participated in several three-way calls with my mother and Health Care Marketplace reps, and we were able to join a $500/month plan partially subsidized by the federal government.  It's not great, but it's better than nothing at all.

2.  Regarding the disability/food stamps debacle, I took /u/nuovo_donna 's advice once again and wrote to all Alabama state representatives, senators, and President Obama about my father's plight.  Most representatives sent me back form letters, but REPRESENTATIVE MO BROOKS (shouting out to him even though I disagree with his political views) pushed Dad's case through the system and we received our first disability payment in June.  It included back payments through October, allowing my parents to start a small emergency fund.  The food stamps office reduced our monthly amount but has not cut us off entirely.

It took several months of arguing and debate, but in June my parents also finally allowed the house to go into foreclosure and moved into a two-bedroom apartment.  I am especially pleased with this development, because it puts my parents' finances in the black for each month.  Instead of losing money monthly as they were in my previous post, they can now save a little each month toward my dad's future long term care needs.  I now have full transparency into my parents' finances, so thank you to /u/lets-go-bravos for helping me put a plan in place towards this end.

My dad is still taking Aricept (the generic version -- thanks /u/dutch_ninja ) and his doctors have also added Prozac and are experimenting with Namenda at the moment.  He has good days and bad days, but on his good days we are able to converse fluidly and enjoy our time together.

I've been very busy with all of these life changes, but I unexpectedly landed a paid internship this summer in the insurance field at a Fortune 100 company.  While insurance is not related to my field of study in college, I find it interesting, and more importantly it should allow me to support my parents as my dad develops long-term care needs.  I also began dating a wonderful young man in the spring -- he's been nothing but sympathetic to my family's plight, and he lives in the city where my internship is located.  The internship will lead to a full-time job in January if I perform well this summer.  My future is looking brighter for the first time in a very long while.

Thank you again, /r/personalfinance .

I'm 24 years old, and make approximately $40,000/year before taxes and healthcare. The problem is, a large portion of my pay is bonus/commission related, so my paycheck is always fluctuating.

&gt; Some people have called the prospect of limited block space and the
&gt; development of a fee market a change in policy compared to the past. I
&gt; respectfully disagree with that. Bitcoin Core is not running the Bitcoin
&gt; economy, and its developers have no authority to set its rules. Change in
&gt; economics is always happening, and should be expected. Worse, intervening
&gt; in consensus changes would make the ecosystem more dependent on the group
&gt; taking that decision, not less.
&gt;
&gt;
This completely ignores *reality*, what users have experienced for the past
~6 years.

""Change in economics is always happening"" does not begin to approach the
scale of the change.

For the entirety of bitcoin's history, absent long blocks and traffic
bursts, fee pressure has been largely absent.

Moving to a new economic policy where fee pressure is consistently present
is radically different from what users, markets, and software have
experienced and *lived.*

Analysis such as [1][2] and more shows that users will hit a ""painful""
""wall"" and market disruption will occur - eventually settling to a new
equilibrium after a period of chaos - when blocks are consistently full.

[1] http://hashingit.com/analysis/34-bitcoin-traffic-bulletin
[2] http://gavinandresen.ninja/why-increasing-the-max-block-size-is-urgent

First, users &amp; market are forced through this period of chaos by ""let a fee
market develop"" as the whole market changes to a radically different
economic policy, once the network has never seen before.

Next, when blocks are consistently full, the past consensus was that block
size limit will be increased eventually.  What happens at that point?

Answer - Users &amp; market are forced through a second period of chaos and
disruption as the fee market is rebooted *again* by changing the block size
limit.

The average user hears a lot of noise on both sides of the block size
debate, and really has no idea that the new ""let a fee market develop""
Bitcoin Core policy is going to *raise fees* on them.

It is clear that
- ""let the fee market develop, Right Now"" has not been thought through
- Users are not prepared for a brand new economic policy
- Users are unaware that a brand new economic policy will be foisted upon
them



&gt; So to point out what I consider obvious: if Bitcoin requires central
&gt; control over its rules by a group of developers, it is completely
&gt; uninteresting to me. Consensus changes should be done using consensus, and
&gt; the default in case of controversy is no change.
&gt;

False.

All that has to do be done to change bitcoin to a new economic policy - not
seen in the entire 6 year history of bitcoin - is to stonewall work on
block size.

Closing size increase PRs and failing to participate in planning for a
block size increase accomplishes your stated goal of changing bitcoin to a
new economic policy.

""no [code] change""... changes bitcoin to a brand new economic policy,
picking economic winners &amp; losers.  Some businesses will be priced out of
bitcoin, etc.

Stonewalling size increase changes is just as much as a Ben Bernanke/FOMC
move as increasing the hard limit by hard fork.



&gt; My personal opinion is that we - as a community - should indeed let a fee
&gt; market develop, and rather sooner than later, and that ""kicking the can
&gt; down the road"" is an incredibly dangerous precedent: if we are willing to
&gt; go through the risk of a hard fork because of a fear of change of
&gt; economics, then I believe that community is not ready to deal with change
&gt; at all. And some change is inevitable, at any block size. Again, this does
&gt; not mean the block size needs to be fixed forever, but its intent should be
&gt; growing with the evolution of technology, not a panic reaction because a
&gt; fear of change.
&gt;
&gt; But I am not in any position to force this view. I only hope that people
&gt; don't think a fear of economic change is reason to give up consensus.
&gt;

Actually you are.

When size increase progress gets frozen out of Bitcoin Core, that just
*increases* the chances that progress must be made through a contentious
hard fork.

Further, it increases the market disruption users will experience, as
described above.

Think about the users.  Please.",cryptocurrency,1437591069

Am I killing my future financially?,"I recently completed a PhD in materials engineering this spring, and have been actively seeking job opportunities since December. I have a vehicle, no debt, and roughly $25K savings. As of now, I currently have two offers on the table - one federal (Maryland) and the other within the private sector (Connecticut).

The federal position is more general test engineering and most people already serving in similar capacity do not have a PhD while the private sector position requires a PhD and is materials specific. The pay is quite different up front but is more comparable after a couple of years. The downside of the federal job is diminished pay upfront, but after a couple years I would be a GS 12 and not have to compete for any positions after that point assuming I qualify for them. The private sector job pays more and is at a company on the rebound, but in somewhat of a volatile market (energy based); I am somewhat concerned about room for growth at this position and am not 100% certain if I want to continue research/product development. It would also consume slightly more of my time and be more stressful (comparatively). I have family in Maryland and Ohio, which factors into consideration somewhat as travel from CT would be less convenient. I don’t want to live in CT forever, but should I take the position and view it as a stepping stone? The job is performing many of the same tasks I have already done so I am unsure of personal growth, but everyone always says that money talks…. Am I being a complete idiot financially with leaning towards the federal position?

Any comments, criticism, or insight is much appreciated. This is quite a difficult decision for me as I have been in academia for 9 years and have very limited industry experience. Please let me know if additional information would be helpful. Thanks!

personalfinance,"Thinking about re-financing my Private Student Loans, but not sure there’s a benefit for me...","I’m 31 years old with roughly $63,000 ($43,000 Private at Variable 4.25% and $20,000 Federal at fixed 4.75%) in remaining student loan debt that I’m slowly chipping away at, and lately i’ve been wondering if there are options out there that could potentially save me some time or money in my efforts.
  
I have a good paying job that’s not in Public Services or Teaching, so I don’t believe I’m eligible for anything in terms of hardship or forgiveness. My loans are before 2007, which means PAYE isn’t an option. It seems like the only available avenues are IBR or potentially a refinance.
  
I’m not even sure I’d qualify for IBR given the current total of my Federal Loans (the calculator on the FASA site doesn’t list it as an option) not being a significant amount compared to my income. Frankly, I don’t know that this is really for me either as I’m wanting to cut through things faster, not slower.

So I guess that leaves me with refinancing. Most of the searches I’ve done or offers I’ve seen aren’t better than my current rate. However, the variable aspect of my private loans has me a bit scared if interest rates begin to climb. I wonder if it would be best to bite the bullet on a slightly higher fixed rate now rather than waiting till things get bad. Should I look into a refi or maybe even a private loan that I use to pay off the student loans all together? Is that even an option?
  
My wife and I have been working on a budget lately that will allow us to start putting more money toward the loans in order to help pay them down faster. Ultimately, I think this is probably the only real answer for me but I figured it didn’t hurt to ask around and explore options that maybe I hadn’t thought of yet…sans prostitution or selling organs.

I have a little chunk of money coming my way soon (not necessarily an immense windfall) in the range of ~$8000-$9000 and I want to make sure I use it properly and wisely. I currently have the following as my stats (figures rounded):

* $8500 in credit card/LOC debt (0% on one for a year and 18.99% APR after November, the other is a 4% personal unsecured loan, each about half)
* $12000 in student loan (4.5%)
* $20000 on a car (4.5%)
* $1450/mo in rent (looking to move/reduce but not sure if cheaper rent or owning is better)
* Credit score is right around 680 but down from the 820 I had two years ago primarily due to carrying high balances on my cards (although I am good about paying way, way over minimum)

My major goals are to eliminate my debt I accrued as a stupid young single man in the 2000s during college and then my lower interest items. I'm making good progress with budgeting and financial challenges (curbing eating out and impulsive used book buying in particular) as well as having refinanced my car for a lower interest rate at a shorter term and also transferring an 18.99% debt to a 4% personal credit line this last year but I definitely am feeling the pinch to not be quite so paycheck to paycheck, even if it's way better than it used to be. I will preface all of this with ""I really, really suck at saving badly"" even though I am trying to change that, aside from my retirement which is pretty healthy at this point since I can't pull out from it to goof around.

Given my payout I am looking at potentially zeroing out my credit debt completely to get the low hanging/high interest stuff out of the way. However my rent is really high and I know buying would also help with reducing costs per month. With these stats would the better course of action be to:

1) Pay off my credit/LOC debt in one fell swoop
2) Split the total windfall across various debts
3) Use the money as a down payment on property or
4) Some combination of the above

As far as the house my only concern is that I may want to move from the area/state before the equity would really build -- one friend is really encouraging me to get a house while others are saying to pay down debt first. I love where I am but don't know if my partner and I will get the itch to leave the state to experience new things. I am inclined towards taking on debt and like I have been doing but also torn because my rent is way higher than a monthly mortgage for my area and don't know how much of a sink it is versus getting rid of the debt.

personalfinance,Are there investment opportunities in low-interest student loans?,"Hello. I'm an 18-year old Finnish student about to start studying in a European university this fall (econ / math). It's an expensive program, totalling in with living expenses on about 15,000 € / year. I get 10,000 € / year from government student aid, so that means I'm taking 5,000 € of student loan annually. 

However, I could get a maximum to 8,400 € of government-backed loan with an additional loan-exemption of roughly a a third of the total loan capital (e.g. the more loan I take, the larger the exemption I get). 

Since the interest rates for student-loans are currently low (~1 % annually), would it make sense to take the maximum possible amount of student-loan and invest the extra left-over capital in some sort of index fund? From there I could have several options - keep building on that fund or use the saved-up money to repay my loans, which would leave the actual amount to be repaid substantially lower than were I to take only the loan I need. I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations and with 5,000 € / year it would come to 10,000 € to be repaid after 3 years, while with 8,400 € / year I would have to chalk up just 7,600 €.

That being said, this isn't really the complete picture yet as I will obviously do a master's after my bachelor's, and might end up changing universities / majors before graduating.

personalfinance,College student getting loans...,"I am applying for loans for college, and I have a few questions.

• I heard that the gov't is going to start raising variable loan rates, but I don't know how much. Is it better for me to get a fixed rate loan even though current variable rates are lower?

• we were thinking that it may be best to just get the whole loan at once and have the company hold half of it second semester. Because credit score lowers everytime I get a price inquiry, what should I do? 

• does getting a larger amount of money for the loan yield a higher or lower interest rate?

The USMNT offense got on track via a Clint Dempsey hat trick, his first ever in international competition, while crushing Cuba 6-0.  The United States looked good in attack with Aron Johannsson partnering Dempsey after Jozy Altidore was sent home after the group stage.  Cuba decided to press the USA from the outset and they left Michael Bradley with time on the ball and were not very good at defending crosses.  Not a good look when playing the USA.

The big question for the USA is who starts in defense?  Seattle Sounders Brad Evans has been good at right back with the chances he has been giving when replacing an ineffective Timothy Chandler.  The centerback pairing is also a question mark with Omar Gonzalez, John Brooks, Ventura Alvarado and possibly Tim Ream all in the mix.  But left back should see the return from international retirement of DeMarcus Beasley.  Beasley was talked out of retirement by Jurgen Klinsmann in anticipation of the next two rounds.

personalfinance,"I'm 19yo and in good shape financially, but still don't know the best way to handle my summer earnings.","I read the How to handle $ and the Not unique: Handling $$$ but I'm still confused on what to do. Let me give some background information.

I will be college sophomore in the fall at US midwest private uni. I did not receive financial aid my first year because of complicated reasons (I can give detail if you want but irrelevant for post). I took out $8k in a loan this year, but managed to pay of $1.8k already.

This summer I have earned $2k strictly for college, and currently have $350 in cash. I have no debts other than student loan. My parents financially support me and help pay for college. I *plan* on making at least another $1.2k, hopefully $1.7k depending on variables, this summer. That would bring me to around $1.5-2k in cash come summers end.

My question is how can I use this money? I would like to have at least $150 in spending money for the start of college, and don't anticipate spending more than $140 during the remainder of summer.

Investment? Pay off more loans? Savings? Emergency fund? Right now I'm thinking about the pay off loans thing. My reason is because my loan interest rate is 4.5-5%, which *I think* is higher than any investment portfolio or other fund that accrues interest. Definitely higher than a big fat 0% on my savings. Also on the emergency fund, my family would pay for medical expenses if I broke an arm or got mono, and I have a good health history, so I doubt I'd need that. I also have no car or expenses like that.

Sorry if this could have been answered by the FAQ. I read it but even though I'm an ex-Actuary major I'm still too dumb to get any answers from it. I mean I know mathematically what would be worth the most in the long run (except for stuff about the market and potential investment profits), but this question involves more than just numbers, right?

We will be able to put 20% on a house (200-250k price range) in about a year's time frame. However, given that rent does not give you any equity, would it be smarter to put our current cash savings (14k, excluding our emergency fund) into a down payment, pay extra on our mortgage for the next year, then refinance to get rid of PMI? 

The way I see it, if we continue to rent until we have a downpayment, we are basically throwing away that rent money when it could be gaining us equity. Yes, we would have to pay PMI until we refinance, but PMI is much less than rent. We would be ""throwing away"" 12x$920 by renting for a year versus 12x$200 by paying PMI.

personalfinance,(CAN) How badly will this affect my credit score?,"I have a visa credit card with my credit union, and I've been living out of town all summer. I spent about a hundred dollars on greyhound to get here, and put it on my credit card. Since my bills are still being sent to my earlier place of residence, I've been having my mother mail me those bills, and I've just received about four of them at once. It looks like the greyhound payment I sent in was a month late due to the lag in receiving the bill, and so they didn't even receive the minimum amount I was supposed to pay of somewhere around $10. So, there was a very small interest rate, which meant that I hadn't paid my full balance yet. This on top of some other small purchases that I didn't think about until now (all of this is my fault and I'm aware of it) mean that for a few months I haven't been making any payments on a really small credit card debt. Today I paid back all of it at once and there is no remaining debt. My credit union is well aware that my savings balance is orders of magnitude on what I've been spending, and that I wasn't skipping payments because I couldn't afford them (assuming someone were to look).

Is it a really bad thing to miss minimum payments on a credit card, even when the payments are in the order of ten dollars? The interest rates alone have cost me about ten dollars, which means I'm down a sandwich, and that I don't care about, but I'm suddenly worried that my carelessness may have destroyed my credit rating.

We've owned our home for five years. When we were approved for a mortgage, we were only able to put 3.5% down, so we got an FHA loan. I really hate paying mortgage insurance, but it was necessary with the FHA loan. A couple years ago I was hoping to adopt a lower interest rate via the streamline program, so I called the mortgage company and they told me that they didn't ""do"" streamlining, and that it wouldn't be worth it because of changes to the mortgage insurance, so I pretty much gave up.

The other day I was talking to a co-worker who is purchasing a house about my hatred of mortgage insurance, and another co-worker said something about how the mortgage insurance was based off of a loan-to-value ratio, rather than whatever I assumed it to be. That got me thinking about getting rid of the insurance again, as I know that the value of my home has increased since we bought it in 2010. I tried to Google the subject, but the subject matter sufficiently went over my head. I was hoping someone would be able to kind of explain it like I'm five for me, and maybe give me a glimmer of hope in regards of dumping the insurance.",finance,1437616906

personalfinance,Is my mother being scammed with her life Policy? (US/UK),"Hi reddit this is my first time posting and was looking for some advice. 

I am currently living in the UK and my mother (66) is in NY. She has a bit of trouble reading and writing sometimes so I suggested that she get the help of some relatives to open a life insurance policy. She was originally approved for an amount of $100,000 however had to opt for $50,000 with my sister and I as beneficiaries. She is currently paying $65 a month, however when I was asking about the policy I soon discovered that the relatives were also involved. When I confronted them about it, they suddenly tell me that my mum's life policy is now $500,000 and they are paying $700 a month towards it. I have requested to see some documentation about this however they are refusing to show anything. All the documentation is going straight to the relatives and my mother currently doesn't even have a contact number for the policy yet alone any paperwork (original or copies). My mother is currently living with these relatives and is scared of causing any problems with them.

I feel as if these relatives have used this opportunity to take advantage of my mother in order for them to get a large pay out where they were originally not even meant to be apart of the policy just assist her in setting one up. When I mentioned to my mother about the $500,000 she had no idea what I was talking about, I feel that she signed for something she wasn't even briefed on. Ideally I would like my mum to cancel the policy and get proof of cancellation and start a new one with the amount she was approved. Is there anything I can do to make sure that they are simply not using this as a money making scheme?",finance,1437655792

I called them 3 weeks ago to ask them to split all my loans into separate accounts. They said it couldn't be done and that I needed to call every month to direct any extra payments to a specific loan. I pressed them, since I had seen other redditors post about having their loans split, and they came back and said they could do it after all but it would take 3 weeks to process.

I got a call saying that they could separate them by interest rate and subsidized/unsubsidized (I would end up having 4 accounts) but I told them that, even though there would be 17 accounts/tokens, I would still like to be able to pay towards a certain loan since they are all separate loans. The guy seemed irritated but said 'okay'.

I then got a call back yesterday, almost at the 3 week mark, with they guy saying he'd like to talk about what they 'can and cannot do' when separating my loans. I'm getting pretty annoyed, especially because I can't just get through to his extension directly.

I've always been told to save a percentage of my salary every month and it's been something I've done for so long I don't know if I've ever actually thought about it.

I have some debt left on my car that I'm also paying off monthly but the interest rate on that debt is larger than what I'm receiving from my savings.

Would it not make sense to stop saving, pay off that debt in the shortest possible time and then start saving again when I'm debt free?

If it makes any difference, I pay around 2.5% more on my car loan than I earn on my personal savings and I reckon I could finish paying off the car in under a year if I didn't do any saving.

Thanks for your advice!

I recognize that a lot of this debt is awful and irresponsible; I've spent the last six months getting my shit together, getting informed, and working hard to pay off debt. Quit my old job for a better paying one, not shopping, not eating out, and transferring balances where it's appropriate to do so. I pay for my own gas and personal expenses like shower items, clothes, etc. 

Previously I had a large balance on my PayPal Credit account (19.99% APR) and a large balance on my Target card (22.99% APR), but I transferred those to cards with lower interest rates. I recognize that I have a lot of credit cards, but at this point, they're good for my credit utilization and the only thing adversely impacting my credit as far as they're concerned is the age of accounts, so I'm okay with it for now.

I am trying to return to school to finish up my undergrad but the university will not allow me to enroll with any loans currently in default. To take care of that, I consolidated most of my loans recently with Nelnet. This amounted to a principle balance of $12,739.55 with a 4.625% interest rate so the total by the time I pay off that loan will be approximately $17,686.99. I pay $100/month towards this. However, I was unaware of (forgot about/ didn't pay attention to/failed at double checking) one that I left out. I had them with so many different companies and was pretty careless. This loan's principle is $3000 and it has garnered $1200 in interest from the collections company. I have been told two options to take care of it. Pay it off in full or consolidate again (either through Nelnet or another company).

So finally to my question:


1. Do I consolidate again to include the $4200 loan that I did not include the first time?
2. Do I pay off the loan with all of my savings?
3. Do I use my credit cards to pay some of it down?

personalfinance,Attending college soon and I am extremely worried about how to start handling my expenses,"Hi, I'm 18 years old. I recently graduated from high school and I am going to be attending a state college that costs about $25k/year.

Previously, my father had told me that he would pay for my first year, but now, after I have rejected Federal Loans, it looks likely he will renege on his verbal agreement.

I know other people have it worse than me, but I am freaked out about how I will deal with student loans--and where I'll get my student loans from.

The main problem is that my father makes $250k-$300k year and this makes it impossible for me to get any grants. I don't qualify to be an independent student either even though I probably will not receive any help during college.

I have about $7k that I've saved my entire life. Should I invest it? Save it? How?

I know next to nothing about managing money and I don't know where to start. I have searched on the subreddit and looked at the wiki a little, but I don't know how to take action on what I read.

personalfinance,What's the most cost effective way to go about my student loans?,"I've had these loans for awhile now and have been regularly paying them off without missing a beat. I only recently decided to begin adding a little extra money beyond what is due each month because I feel like I can budget for it now and it seems that paying them off faster will result in less money paid over time. The issue that I have is that my debt holder, Navient (it's basically Sallie Mae), made a couple of things clear to me that I did not know. I'm asking here how to handle them.

The issue is that I have multiple loans owned by Navient and they all have different interest rates. As such, I'd like to pay off the ones with the highest interest first. There are two things that I was told by Navient:

1. You cannot pay towards individual loans when enrolled in automatic debit.
1. Payments for the same loan over the amount due will always go towards the next payment period.

For (1) I think the way around this is to call and pay over the phone rather than using the web service. I would want to go with automatic debit because it shaves off 0.25% from the interest rate.

For (2) I just wanted to pay off the single loan entirely (or in pieces, if possible) for the amount that is the balance. My question here is what is the balance? Does the balance they show include the principle plus the estimated interest they earn over the course of the loan? Or is the balance just the principle less whatever I've paid so far? I do not want to, for example, pay them the balance of a 6% today only to find out that next month they have not applied that full payment and have been holding it so as to accrue more interest. That just seems scummy. Do they have me locked in for X years, or can I get out of it sooner and pay less overall in the end? What's my strategy?",finance,1437672145

financialindependence,Late 30's and just at the corner of FI,"This is a bit long and I guess sort of bragging or looking for a pat on the back. But since this Financial Independence, you all should understand. I would like to hear some feedback. I also know that some will hate on this too. I also want others to consider choices they make in life and realized that some of those choices cost money. I wish I had know that in my early 20's. Lots of money spent with nothing to show for it. Cars, dates, beer, cigarettes, cable tv, eating out. Stuff like that. That stuff is fun, but it is hard to save when you are spending money.  

Anyway:

Wife and I live in East Tennessee. COL is very manageable. When we first got married a little over 11 years ago, we bought our house new in the middle of one of these neighborhoods that spring up out of nowhere. At that time, I was working at Wal-Mart and in school (Fresh out of the military) and she was wrapping up her Masters and just started at a regional company. We were making about $50K total, before taxes. Our house was $123,000. Interest at that time was mid 5's. We used VA and a few other things for first time owners. Very easy to make payments. Never got worried or anything. Bought in 2004.

For the first 5 or so years, we only made the normal payments. Then we started messing with something that the banks and sellers never talk about: amortization calculator. Looking over 30 years, the loan was going to cost us an additional $130,000 or so. That's more than what we bought the house for! So we started paying a few hundred extra here and there until we made it a monthly habit. 

Starting around 2010, we had doubled our annual income, BUT, not our annual spending. I came from a military family that knew how to stretch a dollar and I had enough financial mistakes when I was in my 20's to not care about material things anymore. She is very frugal and her parents did a bang up job teaching her how to save. We still had/have fun, just kept it reasonable. So we started to really save our money. We also don't have children for a couple of different reasons. 

We began to see that the interest rates were much lower than what we paid, so we went to refi our house for 15 years.  The banks that we went to wanted to do a full background check on our finances.  Hell no. I understand that after to housing bubble burst, rules got changed, but they were asking for too much and they wanted to appraise our house and base it on other foreclosures in the area. Again, hell no. We are not paying for the sins of someone else.

So we started to pay down the house in massive chunks. It was easy for us because we were fortunate enough to both be savers. We question all purchases. Very rarely eat out. When we do, it's less than $15 for both of us. We also buy groupon stuff so that eating out is half the price of what it should be. We made (past tense, you will see in a minute) good money but did not squander it. Matter of fact, at my previous employer of 7 years, I was one of the lowest paid, but highest income to debt. Same for Wife.

Between 2012 and 2014 we tripled our house payment. Every few months, we would then write a huge ass check to the bank. The day after Thanksgiving in 2014, we wrote a check for the remaining $5000 and went to the local branch of the bank the loan was though and paid the house off. It was actually rather anticlimactic, haha. We were expecting balloons and streamers! Nope, we just the bankers card and that was. Meh. We also saved about $85,000 on the life of the loan.

Some will argue that because of inflation, debt is sometimes better. I don't agree. Be in debt is being indebted to someone or something. I don't like that concept. When you have a ton of debt, you have to pay it off. To pay it off, you most likely need to work. Working means you have to answer to someone, which means you are being controlled. Nope, don't like that at all.

At the beginning of 2014, I was laid off. I was GIS Analyst working in the radiological field. I have a degree in Geography, not nuclear-whatever. I was never comfortable in that job. Lots of travel to some fairly nasty places. When the layoffs were announced, I spoke to my wife and we figured that now would be a good time to get out of there. So I volunteered to get the ax. The odd thing was (remember that I was on the lower end of the pay scale) the high earning folks were PANICKING! ""I can't go more than a few weeks without a paycheck"" kind of stuff. I was for real shocked. The folks were making $75,000 to low mid six figure! In East Tennessee, that is a lot. Many were married with spouses make about the same plus or minus a little. And they were afraid of losing their houses and cars.  It was insane.

Less than a year after I was laid off, we have a paid for house, no car debt and no student loans. We paid that stuff off with money that was left over after adding to our savings account. We are thrifty. The hobbies we had over the years, we would buy second hand and held out until we got a good deal. Triathlons, running, bicycling, photography, Amateur Radio, motorcycling. Almost all used stuff. Buy it, use it for a while and then sell it for what we paid or sometimes even make a profit. Just can't be rash about it.

Again, she and I are very fortunate and thankful to the jobs we had/have. We do give back to the community and help out others. We are not greedy. We just don't spend more than we make. 

When we travel, it is very low key. Mostly in the local region. We have dogs, so we have to be mindful of that and it takes a dog sitter that costs as much as a hotel. We don't buy into the ""spend money to have fun"" stuff. We see family and peers damn near ""make it rain"" in order to have fun. Some take a few vacations a year to the tune of 5 grand or more and nothing to show except for stress when they get back. Damn.

We don't have cable, we don't have an entertainment budget and we don't squander money. If there is something we want to buy, we sell something we currently own. If we don't want to sell something, then we don't buy it. 
We are both in our late 30's. I own my own business now. She still works for the same company because they are actually good to her. But, since she is not beholder to debt, she does not take shit from them either. And she gets a lot of respect for it.

I work from home and take care of the home stuff. When she comes in from the office, I have dinner ready and her lunch for the next day. I take care of the house stuff, bill, cooking, cleaning, on top of running my business. She would do that too if I were office bound and she stayed at home. I like the arrangement. We have tons of free time on the weekends now to really have a good time. 

Those 11 years of saving and putting it on our debt? They went by very fast. Lots of our peers and family say that we are not enjoying our youth while they are worried about their future. No, we have immensely enjoyed our time thus far. I was quite frankly a financial fuck up when I was young. I don't think like that now, so it evened out.

Wife and I have a type of freedom that most of the people we know don't understand. Knowing that it would take some very serious circumstances for our house to be taken away is one hell of a feeling. Knowing that we are going to retire in our mid 50's when most of the folks around here plan on retiring when they die. No, not going to do that. We try and get them to think about that and they always ask ""but what are you going to do when you don't work?""

personalfinance,How can I survive the super low CAD?,"22/M

Hey everyone - really don't know my best option here and tens of thousands of dollars of debt are at stake! Any advice is appreciated!

Situation:
I'm a Canadian about to start law school (for 3 years) in the US.

Major problem is how disgustingly low the CAD is right now (my costs for the 3 years have increased almost 60k due to falling exchange rates from .93 to .77 in the last year).

In this post I'm converting my canadian stuff with a .77 rate. And unless otherwise stated Im using USD. A year ago I wouldn't have even needed a loan for first year :(

Total cost of living including tuition will be about about 80k USD for the school year.

I have about 45k USD as a parental contribution for this first year, but may only have around 20k USD as contributions for the 2nd and 3rd year each.

I have 12k USD of personal savings.

I am trying to get zero interest loans from the Canadian government right now and recently received my first term bill of 34k USD due August 13th.

For the first year, I therefore currently have 57k for an 80k year and require 23k in loans.

That 57k is in our Canadian bank accounts right now of course (74k CAD)
 
**Key question right now**: 
Should I just rush to pay the first semester bill of 34k before the CAD falls lower 

or

Wait until August 13 hoping it hops up a bit

or

Find a way to take a USD loan and pray that in a year or perhaps two or perhaps three years the CAD will recover and I can much more easily pay off the loan ---- if so: how high of an annual interest rate would make this option acceptable? Note that I have relatively well-off family in the US who could co-sign my loan.

That last option is the main thing I'm trying to figure out and applies to all 3 years. Are US loans with interest (vs. a zero or near-zero CAD loan) preferable due to how bad the CAD is doing right now? I know this presumes things will get better over the next few years, but history indicates that's what happens. Will a hope of a rising CAD make an interest rate worth it, and what interest rate is that?

personalfinance,Need advise for buying first home,"Hello, Reddit 

I am currently relocating to Augusta GA for work and I really would like to purchase a home. I 

am 24 years old married with zero debt and no children. I am currently looking at homes around 210-

220k I wanted to know if it is a financially savvy decision to purchase a “forever” home rather than a 

starter home that I would end up selling in the next 5-10 years due to having a family. 

Current Finances   

Take home monthly after taxes (my current state of residency is Maryland not sure if it effects the tax 

rate) = $3,684.48

I am expected to be promoted in February so that will increase my income a bit and once myself and my 

wife move to Augusta in the next coming months she expects to start working full time. 

Amount set aside to purchase a home = $40,000.00 (using a VA home loan so no PMI)

We have about 53k in checking/savings but want to save at least 10k for emergencies

Established monthly expenses (rounded up to be safe)

Gas = $240.00

Cable/internet = $100.00

Phone Bill = $180.00

Car Insurance = $120 

Food = $400

Misc = $200.00 

Fun money = $200.00

Total = $1440.00

Income – established expenses = $2,244.48 - $899(possible mortgage payment) = $1,345.48

So here’s where I’m in a foggy with remaining housing expenses I expect for the mortgage to fall around 

the upper 800ish area but at the same time new expenses like electric, water, sewage, trash removal, 

misc expenses I am not educated about might come into play. I don’t want to stretch myself to thin but 

at the same time I don’t want to get a small home that I may out grow quickly and miss out on the low 

interest rates in the market. So I am asking for any helpful advice.

personalfinance,"Investing, vs paying off student loans","I am opening a Roth IRA here soon and with a new semester starting I noticed I'll be getting a very nice aid package. Two things come to mind. 

1) I'd really like to get a jump on my retirement. So I'm curious what the general consensus is on prioritizing paying down loans vs saving while I'm in school. Some money to each? Put it all in the Roth? pay off debt first and then worry about investing? My thinking is that I should just put it all in the Roth because I can always take principal out if I need extra to pay off loans. I don't anticipate that as I won't have a lot in the way of loans anyway. Thoughts on this?

2) Some of the ""extra"" money I'll be getting as a refund comes from an unsubsidized loan. With an interest rate of 4.66%, I'm thinking that even a very low risk mutual fund could make more money than that. Would it be a terribly stupid idea to take that extra money and invest it while I'm in school to help boost my IRA? According to [Morningstar](http://news.morningstar.com/fund-category-returns/) even a a Bond fund could potentially beat that rate in the 3 years I have left. I realize that if the economy tanks I could end up loosing that money. There's always that inherent risk. I'm just looking at putting this in some really safe mutual funds to try to jump start my retirement as much as possible. Or I could totally shaft myself. Thoughts?

I should probably mention that we have no other debt, and have a very comfortable emergency fund set up. My wife's employer contributes a fixed amount to her 401k, so there's no need to try to max that out.",finance,1437695370

personalfinance,How does 'Debt Consolidation' work exactly?,"I'm just trying to make sure I understand.

Say you owe debt in A B and C places with an average of say 8% interest rate. A debt consolidation is basically company Z buys the debt up from A B and C into one big debt D which they would offer you some new interest rate, let's say 6%? 

Is that a correct understanding of how it works?

If so is there any negatives to paying down some debt BEFORE consolidation? Let's say you owe 5K with the ability to pay 1K right away, will there be any problems with paying 1K before consolidation versus after?

This is an unrelated question but if you had a debt that had the ability to capitalize or add whatever interest it had to principle, but you had the ability to either pay down interest OR principle. I assume it's always better to pay down principle before interest since the net value after capitalization is lower correct?",finance,1437696068

Bitcoin,"""Mathematically Annihilating Malicious Nodes""- in distributed virtual currency banking systems. A paper I wrote as part of a funded startup that screwed me over. Link and story inside.","Earlier this year I was contacted by an old research friend. He graduated two years ahead of me and has gone on to create a Bitcoin company that was essentially an anonymous distributed banking system. They have won numerous awards and have successfully secured VC and are currently in California. 

I was contacted because while he graduated in Computer Science, I'm majoring in Mathematics and have some experience developing algorithms. He presented the problem with distributed banking systems of malicious nodes: recognizing, categorizing, and eliminating them in the most efficient way possible. It seemed like an interesting problem so I agreed to do it in exchange for equity in his startup. Seemed like a pretty sweet deal to solve an interesting problem and get a piece of an up and coming startup. Plus I was able to help out a friend.

A friend and I spent a few weeks on the problem in our free time and came up with an elegant and more importantly automated mathematical solution to the problem, and my friend and his team loved it. 

We sent the paper to the team and discussed it at length over a few days and got to the point where they understood all the fine points. 

Then my friend and I brought up the promised exchange of equity, future plans of where to go from here, etc... And... that's when all contact stopped. A few weeks went by without any contact until I received a message that essentially said, ""thanks for your help, but we've decided to take a break from the startup and will contact you soon."" Yea sure, I never heard from my ""friend"" again other than the occasional facebook ""like"" and cheeky ""comment"" that gives the bullshit impression that we are still really good friends. 

Well I've kept tabs on his company and its progress, and there are very obvious indications that they have continued to use my solution to their malicious node problem. 

So, I guess the lesson is not to trust your ""friends"" when it comes to business decisions. I honestly don't care about the money, but I am chaffed about being back-stabbed by a friend. Yes, I was an idiot. Lesson learned.

I've decided to link a rough draft of the paper here. The solution is complete but there are obviously errors in grammar and some syntax, undoubtedly. This is an older version of the paper, as future versions include adjusting the solution to the specific programming needs of the company itself. I want to avoid legal problems if I can, while still sticking it in my friend's eye. 

I hope the Bitcoin and virtual currency community at large can benefit from at least *some* of this, as I think distributed banking is a key part in the longevity of virtual currency, and eliminating malicious nodes is a big part of that. I've considered publishing this in some sort of conference journal, but I can't really find one where it would fit (I'm open to suggestions). So in the spirit of open access...

Hi folks of Reddit.


I'll start from last year, when as a 21 year old freshman of university from a family of long standing financial and family issues, I was fortunate enough to fly out of the country with a scholarship waiting. You can imagine how ecstatic I was at the opportunity when I've spent parts of my childhood as an illegal immigrant, out of school for years, and with no contact with family besides my immediate one. This was the sort of chance I'd been praying for.


And quite a freshman year it turned out to be. I was extremely stressed out with severe money issues and basically lived off of sliced bread, noodles, and whatever free food events on campus. This still wasn't enough and I ended up living off coupons for a while afterwards. It was extremely stressful and it made going to uni with a fully-capped number of units and my sleep unbearable, let alone my state of mind. Family back home were not able to pitch in any shape or form and I was basically left high and dry. I of course ended up going to the uni counselling services for support and was shortly thereafter taking anti-anxiety and anti-depressants to stave off the immense depressive episode with high anxiety by the next semester. By the end of the second, I went of the deep-end with immense withdrawal when I ran out of money for medication even after a temporary solution to keep me afloat. I eventually decided to save my scholarship by resorting to take a leave of absence mid-way through the semester by taking a leave of absence. This was when salvaging my grades was no longer possible. This attempt at taking a leave of absence was not approved and with a GPA well below my requirement to keep my scholarship, I doubt I'll be able to keep it. Nothing is confirmed yet with no word yet from my admissions office, but they're off on break until 2 weeks before the start of Fall semester. Several of my emails have been likely seen by someone at admission during their weeks of brief work between two breaks at the beginning and towards the end of summer, but nothing has come back to me. But I still keep hope.


So, here I am...hiding in my room from my family, who are absolutely firm and convicted in their beliefs I brought this on myself. Who fail to recognize my sheer dedication to utilize all my resources such as Student Affairs (International Office for food coupons, Counselling for advice and support, Admissions for help in money problems, etc), my professors (some accepted late work even while at the airport), and the academic centre for tutoring. I have several blowouts with them, the most recent of which was the other day, that left me visibly distraught of how much they couldn't and wouldn't accept as true or fully true. I was bawling my eyes trying to defend myself in their eyes and they just scoffed it off. I haven't even bothered telling them about the anti-depressants. Understandably, I want to distance myself from them from now on as much as flipping humanly possible and their negativity and narcissism.


But here comes the stickler. I have no one to rely on. My father's family are bitter with us by default because of my father and thus I have no connection with them. Whatever bridge existed between us and them has long been burned down. My mother's family are mostly dead and those few I do know live out of the country. Family friends are non existent (see the pattern here?) and I know no one, as a friend, close enough to help me out or take me in. I only carry a high school degree with gaps in between and have no job prospects and zero money to my name. I live out of the US in a country with a horrible economy and mass unemployment, whose name I'll keep to myself for now. My only viable option is online work or...pretty much that's it.


I'm all alone and extremely lost. I might be kicked out as they have threatened me with that before and the only job opportunities I think are possible are online (think Elance). I'm in dire need of advice. Thanks /r/personalfinance.",finance,1437743455

personalfinance,Balance Transfer questions: Chase Slate v.USAA?; how much will me credit score be affected?,"(title edit: I meant Chase Simplicity, not Slate)
I have $3300 in debt on a credit card at 11.24%. I want to transfer it to a 0% card to pay it off as rapidly as possible. 


Chase Simplicity offers 0% interest and no transfer fee for 21 months. No annual fee. 


USAA (I am a member) will offer me an Amex card with 0% interest and a 3% transfer fee for 18 months. No annual fee. 


Seems like a no-brainer except that I trust USAA more than a big card company like Chase. Is that silly? Monetarily, the 21 months is obviously superior, but I can make 18 months work, even with the 3% transfer fee. It still saves me money.


Assuming I can get either of these cards with a maximum balance to take my entire debit ($3300), how badly will it affect my score to have a maxed or near-maxed card that is brand new? 


I have a 720 credit score. How likely is it that I will get a card with at least a $4000-$5000 max balance?



EDIT: I need the 0% interest deal to be at least 18 months so any 15 month cards just wont allow me to pay off the balance in time, unless their regular interest rate is 11.24% or lower.




EDIT2: The Simplicity card does have a balance transfer fee of 3% - guess I was only seeing what I wanted to see! Still - despite the fact that I have enjoyed the USAA services, the other card is a better deal.",finance,1437748930
personalfinance,SO received modest windfall - what do to?,"Hi PF - my wife is receiving a modest windfall from her father's estate. We're unsure of what to do with it and would love some advice.

Details:  
Windfall: 30,000  
Her: 30, back in school to pursue medical field career (~3 years school left, ~70-100k salary after, looking at ~40k in debt to cover school)  
Me: 33, work full-time making ~76,000 (salary + bonus)  
  
She has ~11,000 in her personal savings from before we met + ~12,000 in 401(k) from her previous job. I have basically nothing in my personal account + ~3000 in old 401(k) and ~5500 in new 401(k), no monthly contribution (employer adds ~7% at end of year regardless of my input). Together we have joint checking/savings accounts which we pay our bills from and contribute to our emergency fund (600 + 100/mo).  
  
Debts: ~12,500 @ 10.9% (credit card) - we're overpaying by about 150/mo on this right now to bring it down  
94,000 (several student loans ranging from 10.74% - 2.33%)  
  
Upcoming expenses:  
destination wedding for family member in about 8 months, estimate 4-5000 for both of us  
  
I currently have my loans rigged for maximum payoff within my budget. A few months ago I changed everything to extended repayment plans to reduce the minimums; then I apply what is 'saved' towards my highest-interest loan. On my current plan, I will have all my loan debt paid off in June 2020 and pay 11,609 in interest. If I apply 20,000 of this to the loans (in order of interest rate), they will be paid off in May 2019 with 6,725 in paid interest.  
  
I'm thinking our best bet is to put 10,000 of the windfall into the credit card and pay off the rest from her savings, then put the remaining windfall into our loan debt (currently she only has ~5000). So, our biggest question is, should we really throw all of this at debt? Do we just pay off our CC and put the rest in high-interest savings? A CD/IRA/other? Also, will there be a tax liability on this since it's an inheritance? We received a smaller windfall when we got married that had no tax liability, but this is considerably more.  
  
I looked up online savings and CD rates for Ally, Barclay's, and E-Loan but wasn't all that impressed. The best we could do is 2.31% from E-Loan on a 60 month CD - which I believe would barely keep up with inflation.

So I got my federal loans at the absolute worst time (right before the bubble burst in 2007) and I have high interest rates as a result (7.5ish). Let's say I were to get a rate of 4.5 with SoFi. 

What exactly would I be losing with such an arrangement? I'm looking at [an overview](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/federal-vs-private) which appears to explain the differences. However, assuming I get a lower interest rate, and having already completed school, I don't think see a whole lot of benefit. 

Some things to consider... 

 * Forebearance or deferrment. Looks like SoFi has something along those lines
 * Income based repayment. Apparently I can have my loan forgiven after 20-25 years of payment. But I wonder how much more quickly I could pay the loan off at a lower interest rate?

Anything else? Are there any other possible benefits of having federal loans that I'm not aware of?",finance,1437761938
personalfinance,Does a home equity loan make sense in this situation (home improvements and student loans)?,"I read the FAQ and searched for home equity, but couldn't find anything that is our precise scenario. 

My wife and I have owned our house for three years, and plan to stay there until we retire (30+ years). Our town is running an incentive program for solar panels, which is something I have wanted to do for a while. We could afford the solar panels with a few months of saving, but the incentives are only good through September.

At the same time, we have two home improvement projects that we want to undertake, as we are having our first child very soon (as in, any day now). We want to finish the basement and turn it into a playroom/exercise room, and finish the garage. Again, I know we could (and should) save up enough money until we can pay for these in cash, but doing them sooner rather than later would be very beneficial for a variety of reasons.

Also, we have, like many 20-and-30-somethings, a large amount of student loan debt (down to less than $50,000 now, though). I have been chipping away at the highest interest rate loan for over a year now, and have halved the principal, but still owe $13,000 at 7% interest. My wife similarly has an $11,000 loan at over 6% interest.

We have zero credit card debt, and the only other loan we have besides the mortgage and the student loans is my wife's car, which is about $300 a month. We have been putting extra money towards our student loans over the past year or so, and have an emergency fund. We both have stable jobs and make decent, but not exorbitant money, and put a considerable portion of our income in retirement accounts (403(b) and Roth IRA). So I'd like to consider us financially responsible, and not the type to rack up debt all willy-nilly.

With all this in mind, we are considering taking out a home equity loan to cover the solar panels, the two home improvement projects, and our two highest interest student loans. I have calculated all the potential numbers, and we will be saving $500 a month of payments (especially since the solar panels will offset nearly all of our electric bill), and saving at least several hundred in interest if we re-pay the home equity loan in five years. To me, it seems almost unthinkable that we wouldn't do this, except that A) we lose the equity we have been building on our house over the past three years, and B) it does put us greater in debt. However, we have shown over the past year that we can pay off debt quickly and easily, and while we will still end up paying interest, the total amount is less this way.

My credit was a wasteland at the time of purchase, and though i was the primary incomer earner, there was nothing that i could have done to help.  However, i have yet to buy a house.  As this HUD loan is considered a mortgage and my name will be on it, does that remove me from being accepted as a first time home buyer?

I have been a long time lurker and appreciate all of your advice. My wife and I just got married and are looking towards the future and trying to plan our financial goals. I'll provide details and let me know what you guys (and ladies) think!

I am currently a pharmacy resident making about $40,000/yr for just this year. I will then get a job as a actual pharmacist making anywhere from $90,000 - $110,000 from then on out. 

She is a 3rd year medical student on a full academic scholarship (she's way smarter than I am). She has not (nor will) need to take out loans for medical school. After school, she will make around $50,000 a year until after residency. She wants to specialize but isn't sure in what field yet. 

Now for debts. She only has around $30,000 in federal loans from undergrad. We are currently just waiting until she starts residency (around 2 years from now) to start attacking that.

I on the other hand owe around $16,000 to good ole' Uncle Sam and about another $90,000 to my grandparents.

investing,Letter From Investor's Podcast: Thoughts on the Current Market,"**Copied below is an email I received from Investor's Podcast hosted by Preston Pysh and Stig Broderson. What do you guys think of his statements on the market?**

I hope you’re having a wonderful July.  So this e-mail is going to be an important one.  The reason is some of the wealthiest people in the world are starting to send some very bearish signals in the markets. 

Ray Dalio (Net Worth 15 Billion) – “There are now no safe places to invest.” On 23 July 2015”.

Carl Icahn (Net Worth 23 Billion)  - “I believe the Market is extremely overheated – Especially high yield bonds.  If more respected investors had warned about the market in 2007, we might have avoided the crisis in 2008.” On 19 June 2015

Warren Buffett (Net Worth 72 Billion) – his company has made 20.2 billion in profit over the last 4 quarters and his cash position during that period of time has increased by 14.8 billion.  This means he has retained 75% of his new earnings over the past year in cash.  In May 2015, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Charlie Munger talked about their concern with the FED’s continual manipulation of low interest rates and the potential bubble in real estate prices.  The video can be found [here](http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=A2.DT&amp;m=3k.SsslVl7zCZOB&amp;b=HxC_9DSZlaabYWpMlgISJg). 

So I think you get my point.  Lots of people think the market is getting a little scary and some are speaking with their actions.  So what’s the bubble?  Well, Carl Icahn and Ray Dalio think the junk bond market is the potential bubble.  The implications and how that might play out in stocks and other markets is unknown, but threatening.  Below my signature block, I’ve pasted a thorough analysis of Icahn’s concerns.  It was written by my friend Matt.  He was kind enough to send this analysis to me for the group's reading pleasure. 

Finally, here’s a really great [article](http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=A2.DT&amp;m=3k.SsslVl7zCZOB&amp;b=CrzOU_bzuknZOjqywMFaXw) that demonstrates the extreme valuation metrics we are currently facing.  I highly recommend you take the time to read this article from Ph.D. John Hussman. 
Also I think it’s important to point out the unprecedented amount of margin debt that’s being used by wall street presently.  Feel free to check out this chart by [Doug Short](http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=A2.DT&amp;m=3k.SsslVl7zCZOB&amp;b=lKT.JSEdoTZm8b1d_4.v1A) to see what I’m referring to. 
If you are interested in tracking my conversation with Stig and other smart investors in the community, you can go to this point in our [forum](http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=A2.DT&amp;m=3k.SsslVl7zCZOB&amp;b=RaNdgcFT71uahvHoJovr.Q).  (P.s. We've fixed the technical issues we were previously having thanks to our good friend James Meirowsky!)

As we’ve said many times in the past, there’s no way of predicted the short term movements in the market.  With that said, we are getting to a point were major players with large capital are starting to buckle down their hatches.  I’ll leave you with Warren Buffett’s best investing advice: Rule #1: Don’t lose money.  Rule #2: refer back to rule #1.
 
Cheers,
Preston

gaming,New-Blood in beloved series?,"What is /r/gaming's opinion on beloved franchises with established, veteran lead characters, incorporating new installments starring new leads? It's not unheard of. Many great titles have done it. Castlevania has starred some form of Belmont for many a game, yet one of it's most beloved titles starred Alucard, a drastic change for many at the time, I believe. Metal Gear has shared the spotlight between three different characters. You get the idea.

I for one, welcome change. I was very disappointed with what we've seen with Metroid Prime: Federation Force, not simply because it looked lackluster, but because it was a missed opportunity to breath some new, fresh life into the series. Metroid is a beloved franchise, I love running around in the boots of Samus, exploring alien worlds and taking down Space Pirates. That being said, I think the series could benefit by sharing the spotlight with a new character. I find it very hard to imagine that in a whole, vast universe, there is only ONE bounty hunter running around doing cool shit. Imagine, taking control of a new bounty hunter or Federation Trooper. There would be room to try new mechanics and elements, as it isn't quite limited to the specifications that is Samus. Sure, maybe a trooper doesn't have access to brand new advanced beam weapons, but having automatic, elemental projectiles and missiles would offer a different method of taking on the same beasts and pirates we love to destroy. Why not include some sort of booster or jet pack? No, it's not the space jump, but it would offer a new means of traversing whatever planet or station the setting could potentially take place. Scans? No longer first person observations, the information could be offered from a sort of ""Galactic Federation"" database.

The point is, there are times to cherish and maintain a franchise, and times to try something new. This isn't limited to Metroid. I wouldn't even be opposed to playing a Zelda title, a full fledged core Zelda starring someone besides Link. Sure, Hero of Time and all that, but I'm sure there are are a select few Hyrule warriors or adventurers you could plan a whole new story and game around. Tomb Raider? As cool as Lara Croft is, I wouldn't be completely opposed to running through some ancient ruins as someone other than our heroine, albeit somewhere down the line, as they did just reboot the series.

personalfinance,Relocating to America in one year. Questions about optimal saving/debt strategy.,"Hello people of PF. I am currently teaching English in Japan. next summer I am moving back to California. My original plan was to pay off all of my credit card debt in the first six months of this year and save the last six months. This would have been perfect for just myself but recently I got married and that changed things a bit. I have three ideas about how I could save/pay down debt to go back home and wanted some advice on what would be the best course of action. My goal is to put my family in the best possible financial position when we return to America. 

**Numbers**

After Paying all of our essential living expense I have 140,000 yen, about $1,100, to work with. In January the amount I have to pay towards debt or savings will decrease to 100,000 yen, about $800. 

I have two credit cards that I am attempting to pay off. Both of the cards are with Capital One. Sorry I don't remember the interest rate but I will write the minimum payments for each below.

1.  $794.92/$2,000
      min payment - $30



2.  $ 4,866.84/$5,000
     min payment $134



**Plan 1- pay off all the debt**

Use the next 6 months to pay off both cards completely. 

Pros- Least interest paid

Cons- Least cash

**Plan 2 - Pay down debt partially**

Take three months and pay off the first card completely and around 2k on the second card. This would lower my monthly payments while whacking off a large portion of the debt. Once we move to the states and I have a job lined up pay off the card completely.

Pros- Allows us to save a bit and lower debt a bit at the same time.
Cons- Most inefficient

**Plan 3 make minimal payments only**


Keep Paying the minimum Payment only until we get to America and settle in. Then use left over money to pay off the credit card debt.

Pros- Most cash


Cons- Most interest






So these are the three ideas that I have come up with. I would like your opinion of which is best or if you have a better option I would like to hear that as well. I am personally leaning more towards option 2 or 3 because it gives us more cash which I think is more important when we have to pay deposits for utilities and housing.

Also if necessary I can take an additional $1,000 dollars from money I have already saved. Thank you.

personalfinance,I'm 22 and trying to prepare for college,"Hello! I am looking for advice on college. I am currently in community college and will be transferring to a state college in fall of 2017. I am going for computer engineering. I am trying to evaluate which state college would be the best choice. 

For some backround: I currently work 25 hours a week for $12 dollars an hour and my husband works 40 hours a week at $14.50 an hour. We have a total of $2000 of credit card debt, but that will be paid off before I transfer. As for student loans, I currently have about $5000 in subsidized fed loans. For the rest of my community college, we are using just the sudsidized loans and paying the remainder out of pocket.

My biggest issue is picking the school to transfer to. I'm either going to University of Iowa or Iowa State. The tuition is about the same (currently a $400 difference). State is known for their engineering programs, so ultimately that's where I want to go. The main issue is total cost. I can commute to UNI of Iowa so I wouldn't have to move, but I can't commute to State due to distance. Dorm cost is an estimated  $8000 per year at state. That's dorm + food so the only costs I would need to worry about is personal/recreational. Or my other option is living with some friends about 30 minutes away for really cheap (they quoted me $100-200 a month). It would just be myself moving and not my husband.

I know going to University of Iowa would be much cheaper and easier but I'm wondering if paying extra for State would be worth it since it's the engineering college.",finance,1437805094
personalfinance,Should I finish paying off my student loans?,"Hi,

I'm 26. I make about $70,000 - $80,000 per year. I had about $35,000 in student loans before interest. I've had a full time job since I graduated 4 years ago, and have been able to knock the loans down to $5,600 after interest. 

My question is, do I pay them off fully now? Or pay really low minimums with more money in my bank account? 

I have no credit card debt, pay that in full every month no matter what the amount is. I owe about $9,500 on my car, which I got three years ago. That was ~ $30,000 @ a fixed 1.9% APR interest rate, so that's really low.

I plan on moving out soon, and I want money saved up for rent, though I'd prefer to put a down payment on a house...but that wouldn't be for a very long time. I already have a decent cushion, a little over half of what I make per year. I also put money in a 401K which my company matches a small percent, as well as throw money into a Roth IRA every year.

My credit score is perfect with no flags at 790.

Thoughts?

I settled my private student loans a few months back and now have gone from $165,000 in the hole to $22,000 (auto loan, three federal loans). My two credit scores per CK are 740 transunion and 750 Equifax. My payment history is pretty good. 

Right now I am trying to find out if I should close some of my credit accounts or should I focus on just paying down the rest of my debt (or both) Here's a breakdown of the accounts I have:

Federal loan 1: $2800 with a 2.32% rate
Federal loan 2 &amp; 3: $5900 each with a 6.8% rate
Auto loan: $6,600 with a 6.99% rate

Using a few different tax calculators, they all estimate my total tax liability to be around $12k-$14k - all included, so social security, fed, oregon, and medicare/aid stuff.

However, looking at my most recent paystub, I've had $14,050 withheld already (YTD as of 7/17/15). I'm interested in drastically reducing my withholding rate for the rest of the year if possible, and no, I'm not going to spend the extra money. My questions are:

1. Come January, will the IRS charge me interest on taxes not withheld, if, for some reason, I'm wrong?

2. What should I change my rate to? Currently I'm at Fed/OR Allowances: 1. I've done 2 allowances before for a different reason. Can it go higher?

personalfinance,"20yr old college student, questions about investing and retirement planning","I've been a lurker for a little while, but finally decided to make a post, so not 100% sure how all this works. My situation is this: I recently found out I'll be getting a $4,000 refund check from my scholarship every semester, which I will use for rent, food, and utilities. 

My monthly expenses are ~$800/month, and I make about $350/month from my part-time job. I will also be receiving $2,000 in November from my other part-time job. 

So, I figure that $800x12=$9,600 so my scholarship refund and 1,600/2,000 of the Novemeber money will be used for life. Which leaves me with $400+$350x12 - (book costs) = ~$4,000 of ""spending money"" per year. Currently, I have about $1,500 in my bank account

I currently have $500 set aside in a Money Market account, which is just money I set aside so I wouldn't touch a long time ago. I also have another $1,000 as my emergency fund, as well as the financial support of my parents.

My question is, what would be the best course of action to take, in terms of investing and retirement? I've talked to a financial adviser at my bank, who suggested I put the money into a Roth IRA, and make monthly contributions. However, I see people posting here about Vanguard, and different investment options, so would that be something that would be a better option? I'm not too sure on the difference between going with something like Vanguard vs my bank's investment service. Also, I have the option to join a Federal Credit Union, but again, don't really know the long term pros and cons of staying with my bank vs switching, besides that the credit union could have better rates for certain things.

personalfinance,Jr at university. Need advice on loans,"Just transferd over to a university and my financial aid offer was a small Pell Grant($1000), a $2750 subsidized loan and a $3500 unsubsidized loan. I am paying on a $3000 student loan from a semester at a different university in 2011. My charges for classes are right under $3000. Disregarding interest rate, should I take all that is offered and get a small car to commute or just take what I need and continue to ride the bus everywhere?",finance,1437837428
personalfinance,Advice on a balance transfer,"Situation: good source of income, but have some leftover credit card debt ($2,500) from my wedding that I've been balancing on my credit union card. I generally pay it off each month, then put it back on the card later in the month via no-fee cash advance. The card has an 8.5% interest rate. I've been paying it down that way over time. 

I recently got an offer for a balance transfer to another credit card at 0% apr for 12 months, which on the face of it seems like a good deal. I can stop balancing back and forth and just keep it all in one place to pay down over the next year (longer time than I need to pay it off).

But the fine print worries me and I don't like credit card companies in general. It seems as though after accepting the balance transfer I basically can't use the card anymore or I'll be charged interest - even if I make payments on the new charges every month. Can anyone confirm that or tell me why else this is a bad idea?

personalfinance,How does buying a house in the new economy work? More details inside,"The average age to own a home by older generations was in their 20's. Now, it seems it's extraordinarily rare to hear someone own a house in their 20's

* I'm recently 24
* Make $72,000 plus bonuses (first job)
* My debts include $90,000 federal student loans and $3,000 in credit card debt with 18 months 0% interest 
* No savings since I just finished grad school and start my job this week
* I pay with all utilities $1600 for rent 

I follow personalfinance religiously and I realize the importance of being debt free in complete. My rent is not high for a 1BR in Boston, it's actually cheap, but it is high in general and I will get a roommate after one year. It's honestly just a gift to myself and costs me 400 a month 

Besides that, I understand I'm sort of throwing away money at rent and I love the prospect of owning especially before Boston starts a lot of their new development

personalfinance,"I am in a pretty good spot, and I think the foundation is laid for me to get into a very good spot, I'm just looking for some blue prints from you guys.","I graduated college last May, and struggled to find any work. I ended up taking the December LSAT and did alright. After the test, I really started to aggressively apply for jobs.

I finally found a decent paying full time job that began in April. The pay is around $22 an hour. However, it ends at the end of September. There is a decent chance that I will get long term job from my current company, however, because of the nature of the funding for my current job, the odds are it will mean taking a pay cut, which depending on what the position is, and how much professional development it would offer me, I would take in a heartbeat. That said, I know I can't rely on getting that job offer, and I have recently started applying for jobs elsewhere. Looking back on my job hunt, from December to mid March, all that I've learned, and the benefit of having some professional experience on my resume, I am confident that I will have something lined up for October.

I have zero debt from my state school history ba. Whatever scholarships didn't cover, my parents picked up. They were also really good during my ten month long unemployment streak, and ultimately I didn't have to chip to deeply into my savings from my past summer jobs. Currently, my only two living expenses are gas, which is around $200 a month, and my portion of the family cell phone plan, which is around $60 a month.

Between my savings before I got my job and since, I have around $17K saved. around $1600 of which has just been rolling over in a 91 day CD doing almost nothing for me, the rest is sitting in a savings account doing even less.

I think there's a very good chance I will go back to school either for a law degree or an MSW. My current job is in the human services field. It has really opened my eyes and made me think that an MSW would be something I would like to pursue.

I also anticipate buying a car sometime in the next three months, and hopefully moving out in September if I get a long term position lined up.

With this all in mind, what should I be doing with my money. I just picked up the rate sheet at my bank this morning, and the money I have in the CD is only bringing in a .20 APY and the rest of the money is only bringing in .15 APY. 

With considerations to my soon to be increasing living expenses, and likely decrease in pay, how much of the $17K should I look to invest? How much should be put in low risk, medium risk, and high risk investments? What levels of interest rates should I be looking? What can I do with my money now to make the transition to full independence that should happen soon take place as smoothly as possible?",finance,1437842313

personalfinance,"Should I ""build up"" on federal student loans while I'm in community college?","I'm a recent higher school graduate about to attend community college in the fall for two years before presumably attending a state school to finish the engineering program I've signed up for. I'll be paying for the full cost of my education. Right now I have a full scholarship for the community college, so I only have to pay for gas and books, but attending the state school will cost me between 30-35 thousand dollars per year. Due to the joy that is the ""Estimated Family Contribution"", I am only given the absolute minimum in aid: a 5500 dollar unsubsidized loan with an interest rate of 4.29%. This amount will increase to 6500 my sophomore year and to 7500 for the last two. My dad is telling me it would be smart to at least take as much as I need to pay for books and transportation costs, which is between one and two thousand per year. To be fair I probably could pay for that out of pocket, as I plan to work during the school year. However I've recently been wondering if it would be wise to just take the full amount both my first and second year, to use for my first year at university? The two loans plus the money I earn from jobs and internships I take during my two years might be enough to pay for half a year of school, significantly cutting the amount of private loans I have to take, which is at a far higher interest rate. So is this a wise way to cut down on private loans, or is the extra two years of interest not worth it? I should probably also ask if this is legal.

Also slightly related question, would it be worth it to go for my masters degree while I'm at school, putting my debt well over 120k, or should I wait to pay off my undergrad, however long that will take?",finance,1437845274
personalfinance,Consolidate debt through a car loan?,"So I recently purchased a vehicle. I am a mechanic and it needed a new engine so I got it for a really good deal. However, because it did not run at the time I was unable to get an auto loan for it. I had to get a personal loan. Which has a much higher interest rate.

The loan I took out was $4500 at 12% for three years. I have already put a new engine in the vehicle and it is now in very good condition. The vehicle book value is about $13000. I put about $3000 into fixing it.

My wife and I have some credit card debt that we are paying on. Totaling about $5000. We both have very good credit and would easily qualify for a sub 2% loan from our credit union.

The vehicle is solely in my name. My thought was to sell the vehicle to her, take out a $10000 loan at the 1.94% my credit union is offering to pay off the credit card(17ish%) and the personal loan(12%) I used to buy the car.

ethereum,"The state of eDollar: introducing the Dai, a cryptobond backing the eDollars stability","Introducing the Dai - 贷
---
The goal of eDollar was to create the ultimate cryptocurrency, with unbreakable stability, autonomously enforced liquidity, and high utility through a focus on ease of use, service integration and accessibility.

It turns out that the best way to develop something this complex is to create each part of the value proposition in stages. For that reason we decided to first focus on the on-chain mechanics of the system, and hold the eDollar brand back until the release of a fully featured UX-optimized app, as well as keeping the name proprietary so we can use it as an asset to present to VC's when raising money for launching eDollar Inc, a real world company that will deliver a service similar to coinbase, but for eDollar (as well as developing the open source wallet app).

The on-chain token will instead be called the **dai**, trading symbol DAI and currency symbol 贷. While eDollar is meant to be a cryptocurrency that is optimized for user experience, dai will not be focusing on user experience at all and will instead be meant as a **cryptobond** where Maker passes on 90% of the yield - interest paid out from dai issuers (similar to bond issuers) to dai holders (similar to bond holders). **The dai is ultimately meant as a contract-level instrument for integration with other dapps and user interfaces as a stablecoin or steady income investment, something our asset management API makes it easy to do. Dapp developers can create their own branded stablecoins or cash coins for their dapps and have them ""backed by dai"", earning income by taking a portion of the yield**

This change was already announced on the [Maker forum](http://forum.makerdao.com) (for the 10 or so users we have :P), and I thought it was time to announce it to the wider ethereum community so you won't be confused that eDollar isn't coming out at frontier launch like it was promised and another stablecoin/cryptobond called dai exists instead.


The peg mechanics are as solid as ever
---
The peg mechanics will be the same core mechanics that governed eDollar, since dai is just a rename. The dai is fully collateralized by 200% of any type of good collateral on the ethereum blockchain (ether, bitcoin, makercoin, DGX gold, augur rep and others), as well as insured by Maker's income, and its power to inflate makercoin in a black swan scenario. In addition to its use as a dapp-integrated stablecoin and cryptobond, the dai will be directly marketed primarily as an instrument for larger lenders and borrowers (who receive 24/7 live support by me and other members of Nexus), or tech savvy margin traders who are able to navigate a fully featured but rough UI, and finally in the future it will focus on DAO debt financing, and even financing for real world companies and start ups.

The goal is that soon after Frontier launch, dai holders can earn a yield of 6.3% APR (while keeping their funds safe from volatility in a USD pegged asset), and dai issuers can borrow money at 7% APR (used for margin trading and liquidity reasons). This puts the dai yield above real world bonds, but the interest rate for borrowers such as bitcoin margin traders is way below the up to 30% APR you have to pay for bitcoin leveraging on bitfinex. As the interest rate is variable, it will be for the market forces to decide where the rate ends up in the medium term, but overall dai is guaranteed to provide a strong credit system for ether traders and traders of other tokens in the ethereum ecosystem to use or integrate in their contracts and dapps.

Using dai in your dapp to provide stability and monetize your float
---
Dai will also be freely available for integration as a backing token by any dapp that needs a stable store of value for its users, so they dont have to worry about volatility of the funds they hold on your platform. If you're a dapp dev that is interested in using the dai as a cash token in your dapp, let me know here or on our forum. We will provide free integration support and guidance on monetization if you're interested.

We are soon revealing the first peek at dappsys, the contract system architecture designed to handle the complexity of the Maker system. All Maker assets (including utility wrappers for using ETH as a smart asset) will implement the four main asset patterns, and new interfaces can be added after going through the governance process.

We plan to become the dominant asset management contract system by treating contract API consumers as first-class users. We will release an ebook on advanced integration patterns with Maker. Much of the content is available now for developers who want to begin integrating dai.

To read more information about the new names and terms we use, as well as the mechanics of the dai you can check some of the recent posts on the Maker forum: 

* [The dai and clarification of other terms](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-dai-and-clarification-of-other-terms/69/4)

personalfinance,Stuck between two problems,"Hey r/personal finance,
So I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I needed advice in general. I've just gotten a part time job that pays double what my last (minimum wage) job would. I've been saving up for several months to pay off car issues (S2000 that I'm trying to sell) Recently I had about $2,000 saved up and decided to buy this guitar that I've wanted for years for $1200 (after tax) 
This guitar is a 98 Fender deluxe Stratocaster and I've seen the type I have run for $2,300 online. It's one of my dream instruments and I thought I wouldn't ever come across a deal like this
However, I was on my way home from work 2 days ago and saw a cat sitting on the side of the road by my neighborhood. This cat looked like it had been outside for days if not weeks. It had a collar and was a neutered boy, however there was no contact info on the collar. I went knocking on all the houses and no one claimed ownership, but several people said they've seen the cat out there for a while. I decided to bring him some food and he scarfed it down like it was the first food he'd had in a while. It was dark and our neighborhood has had coyotes so I took him home where he spent the entire night cuddling and head butting me
I took him to animal control in the morning and he had an upper respiratory infection and several bleeding wounds on his face- however he was not a fighting kind of cat- very sweet. I told them if no one came to claim him then I would.
When I got home my parents said No because they don't want their cat to fight with ""mine"". 
I'm now considering selling my dream guitar (I have about 20 more days to return it) to fund an apartment with a friend and keep the cat.
My main reasons would be that I have lived with this roommate before, I would have time away from my parents, and get to keep my first pet (had several family pets before though)
What do you financially savvy or live experienced redditors think? I've saved cats before but this one felt like he was truly meant to be mine and I'm waiting til Wednesday to plan anything big.
I knew from the start that spending most of my cash on a guitar was stupid but I'm wondering if I'll make a worse decision by returning it for an apartment. 
I also have been wanting to save up about 30k to put into investments- the guitar was a complete impulse buy when I saw it",finance,1437847440
personalfinance,Moving to new city for college teaching job. Rent or buy?,"I'm starting my first full-time teaching job in a new city on September 1st. It's a long story as to why I'm just looking for housing now. There's a number of factors at play here but I'll try to keep it brief:

I know the area reasonably well, my brother was a student there. It's a tenure-track position, so I'm all but assured a job for at least seven years. I am in good shape financially, no debt, plenty invested, cash set aside for a down payment. No worries there. It is just me moving there, no family or anything. 

There is just about zero chance of me leaving this job on my own volition. I think it makes sense to buy a 2 bedroom condo (there's very little in the way of single family houses in this place, very densely populated), and rent out the other room to my brother who is still in the area. My friends and family are giving me mixed opinions. Some are saying go for it, you're a good candidate to buy, interest rates are low, etc., etc. Others are saying wait a year, get used to the area, you don't want to rush the buying process.

It just seems arbitrary to wait a year and rent first. I can commute from my parent's house 60-90 minutes away until I find the right place, so I won't be rushing into anything. It will be a difficult commute though, I hate driving, and I do not want it to impact my performance on the job. Whether I rent or buy I'll be looking for something within walking distance. Deciding to rent now would mean I'd be walking there the first week. Buying would mean likely commuting for the first month or two and probably not enjoying it much.

I wish there was a definite correct answer here, but there doesn't seem to be. Any thoughts? Similar experiences? Thank you for any help you can give me.",finance,1437848278
politics,"Jeb Bush is the predestined ""Inner Party"" GOP nominee - i.e., the real one: The rest are just running interference.","Having watched the Satanic shitshow that is the Republican Party over the years, one thing is certain when it comes to presidential primaries: There are two classes of candidate - **Inner Party** and **Outer Party**, like in Orwell - and Inner Party always defeats Outer Party for a nomination.  Outer Party candidates are only nominated when an Inner Party candidate fails to run, which is typically when the wisdom of the GOP's clearest-eyed internal strategists suggests victory is unlikely.

The distinction between Inner and Outer is not a rigorously defined one, but is clear in context. Despite the adulation heaped on him in retrospect, Ronald Reagan was an Outer Party candidate - which is why he was only able to obtain the nomination in the midst of general Republican disarray still in the shadow of the Nixon era. It's also why he was basically an empty suit whose administration did whatever it wanted with or without him, while he just wallowed in the acting gig of pretending to be a leader.

His Vice President, George HW Bush, however, was profoundly Inner Party (or at least became so once he attained the Vice Presidency), and exemplified some of the factors that usually play into it: Old Money, deep family connections with shady elements and radical right-wing politics going back generations, intimate military and intelligence connections, and the most effective of all conservative qualities - the patient (but insatiable) acquisition of power, both in public and in the background.

To call HW and his crowd (especially Nixon disciple Dick Cheney) ""sinister"" would be an understatement. From the very beginning, they effectively orchestrated Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, dropping back-channel hints to Saddam's regime at every opportunity that the United States had no interest in preserving the independence of Kuwait.  

The message was clear that America would not strongly intervene if - as Hussein was strongly hinting - an Iraqi annexation were to take place. Bush et al had deep knowledge of Saddam Hussein from a long-term intelligence relationship during the Iran-Iraq War, knew he aspired to possess Kuwaiti oil fields, and knew the likely significance of his inquiring about the US disposition toward Iraq/Kuwait relations.

An Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was almost certainly the desired result of the responses to these inquiries, hoping to encourage action that could serve as a justification for massive and politically advantageous intervention.  

To the mind of George HW Bush, raised in WW2-era politics, such a war would definitely secure him a second term. The only problem was that it was too successful, ended too soon, and he overestimated the attention span of an American public now much younger than himself while underestimating the charms of a smooth-talking Democrat named Bill Clinton.

Despite the initial sense that Bill Clinton was a lightweight who had scored a fluke win, these interests - with their deep knowledge of power - were soon forced to respect his ability to elude their tactics, and had failed by 1996 to create any halfway plausible pretext either for running against him or trying to impeach him.  As usually happens in that case, the presidential nomination was ceded to an Outer Party candidate who, despite his long career in the Senate, was never himself a web-weaver in terms of power, and predictably failed.

The plan by 1994 was for Jeb Bush to become Governor of Florida and then run for President in 2000 and resume his father's legacy. However, that plan was postponed when Jeb lost the 1994 gubernatorial race, and only gained the Governor's office in 1998, making 2000 premature.  But his brother George W. won the Texas Governorship in 1994, putting *him* on the track to fulfill this role despite some ""personal shortcomings"" (i.e., being a raving psychopath).

Despite having no credentials or rational argument whatsoever to become Governor of Texas, and no argument against his opponent, the full force of the Bush family machine steamrolled popular Democratic Governor Ann Richards out of office and placed GW in position for the 2000 presidential election. 

Then, despite having done basically nothing as Governor but smirk at executions and create a third-world educational system, the Bush family machine then steamrolled all other presidential primary candidates in 2000, including highly popular Outer Party Senator John McCain.  It then infamously secured Bush the Presidency through a vast web of criminal acts (including actions by his brother Jeb as Governor of Florida), culminating in a lawless Supreme Court decision arbitrarily declaring him the winner of an election he had plainly lost - often known by history as the ""2000 coup.""

We need not run through the long sequence of daily disgraces, disasters, and atrocities that followed for the next eight years, but suffice it to say that the Bush family machine became an effective authoritarian **monarchy** during this period of time, and that the US Constitution was more or less interrupted from 2001 to 2009. 

Having nearly destroyed the US economy and federal institutions to a level it could no longer hide beneath propaganda or overseas distractions, the Inner Party GOP retreated into the shadows to count its vast trove of stolen money and plan its next moves rather than contending the 2008 election, despite Jeb Bush being in a position to do so.   Instead it ceded the political field to an erstwhile Outer Party favorite, John McCain - the man they had previously smeared and crushed in 2000 - and then watched with mild indifference from the sidelines as he failed.

By 2012, the Inner Party once again knew it had no foundation from which to go after the Democratic incumbant, seeing clearly that Barack Obama was untouchable given simple demographic math. Jeb Bush, despite having waited a dozen years longer than the original plan, **opted to wait longer**.  Instead, a self-funded billionaire was nominated - one somewhere on the inner edge of the Outer Party, but whose mere money could never buy him the level or depth of power network that the Bushes had inherited.

Now, however, Jeb Bush is running. So make no mistake about it that he will be the Republican nominee for President, regardless of whoever else runs.  The Republican Party is effectively Bush family property. The Republican electorate simply have no say in the matter. None whatsoever. 

Jeb Bush will be the Republican nominee, and the full force of the media, the markets, the courts, and if necessary, uglier elements will be brought to bear to see him inherit ""his"" more important family property, the White House.

The plan is to have America back on ""the Bush track"" we barely escaped from in 2008 by the Summer of 2017.  Sweet dreams, folks.",finance,1437848844

Bitcoin,An experiment to show who create money value,"Try to imagine that all the people that sell pizza for bitcoin do a discount of 10%.

Now they give a velocity to the value of bitcoin on every buying of pizza, this means that they transfer 10% of the pizza value into bitcoin on each buy. Because on every bitcoin for pizza that I buy I earn a 10% so it's bitcoin/pizza arbitrage.

So I earn when I buy pizza for bitcoin, and who sell pizza earn a **first** time because they will get for sure more than 10% of buying orders.

And they earn a **second** time when they will be able to buy for bitcoin another pizza after the price of bitcoin go more than 10% up.

Only this in a classical mechanics economics will drive price to infinity. Now collectively pizza sellers are central bankers of abundance and deliciousness, Democracy is restored, happiness assured. The age of the pizza driven abundance will be like a renaissance.

personalfinance,"Want to shift IRA income to the current year from future years, allowing me to claim ACA health insurance subsidies, saving almost $28,000 over 4 years until age 65.","Hi,

I'd like others' input on an idea I'm mulling over, that I think can save me about $28,000 over the next 4 1/2 years. It involves shifting a lot of investment income to the current year in order to allow me to obtain affordable care act (ACA) health premium subsides for the next 4 years.

Facts about me and my financial situation:

* I will turn 61 in October of 2015.
* I have about 1 million dollars in a rolled-over IRA, currently invested with a trusted broker and spread among a variety of investments, including stocks and both stock and bond funds. My return over the last few years has just about matched the overall S&amp;P (maybe 1% shy or so).
* I draw $60,000 per year from my IRA (I was on a 72T plan from age 50 until I turned 59 1/2, also drawing $60,000 per year during that time)
* I am unemployed, and am currently paying $7,278 per year in health premiums on an ACA Silver plan (health premiums are just for me - I'm single, no kids).
* Obviously, I am not currently eligible for any ACA health premium subsidies while reporting $60,000 of gross federal income.
 
I am thinking of drawing a little over $170,000 at the end of this year from my IRA (in addition to the $60,000 mentioned above). I would place this money in some kind of (undoubtedly very low interest) demand account (or maybe a set of 3 laddered CD's, maturing in 1,2 and 3 years), arranged to allow me access to the money over the next 4 years (until I turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare).

I would also reduce my annual IRA withdrawals, beginning in 2016, to about $12,000 per year instead of the current $60,000 per year. This would place my Federal gross income just above the federal poverty level, which would allow me to claim close to the maxiumum ACA subsidies for health insurance premiums. The money placed in savings in year 1 (2015) would then be used to supplement my net income for the next 4 years (2016-2019) to the levels I am currently at.

Here are two scenarios I've worked out, to show how both my current situation (Scenario 1) and the changes suggested above (Scenario 2) would play out. 

I have approximated Federal and State income tax on the income flows as accurately as I can calculate (they are based on 2015 tax tables), and have assumed that health insurance premiums will experience an average 20% annual increase each year for the next 4 years. I am assuming that federal ACA subsidies would need to be increased each year by the federal government to allow someone reporting at the federal poverty level to continue to contribute only 2%-3% of their gross income towards a Silver ACA premium.

Please be gentle, I'm already beating myself up enough as it is.

So last october I quit my PhD program in biology because I realized scientific research at a high level is not what I want to do long term. At this point, I had collected about $150,000 in student debt from undergrad and a previous year of masters work. (I had quit a masters program to pursue a PhD program that was free of cost, then finally admitted it wasn't right for me and left with a Masters in Biology).
Around this time I got into a major car accident (my fault), my car was totalled and my insurance skyrocketed. 
I used the money I got back from the insurance company to buy a 2001 Ford Focus and got liability only. I then got a job in a contract position in a lab making 17 an hour. During this time two things happened. 1. I finally identified what I DO want to do, which is web development (don't know if I will ever be able to go to school for that though... may never get to live my dream) and my car broke down. I was tired of having cars that died and so I bought a 2014 Toyota yaris because I truly thought I would be keeping this job.

Regardless, Im stuck in my lease for 3 more months. I am going to help my roomate find a new roommate to replace me and hopefully only have to pay the month of august. Then I can move in with my bf and his landlord will only charge 200 a month extra, which my bf can cover while Im jobless.

I don't know what to do. The obvious thing seems to get rid of the car but I live in an area were I need transportation and I really don't want another junker. Im tired of cars that can't get me where I need to go. I also don't want to use my cash to put down for another car, and with no income I dont think a bank would finance me for another loan so I would literally have to buy a 1K clunker.

I feel like a failure. I knew nothing about money growing up and while I have become much much more responsible it seems the mistakes I made during my college years will haunt me for the rest of my life.

I did get a job interview for monday through my bf who is a winemaker, working as a lab tech. My concern is that its a 3-4 month contract and may only pay between 12 and 15 an hour. There will definitely be overtime as they are harvesting the grapes and said they would I expect I would work 8-10 hour days,but still. Its also an hour commute.
Is it better to take this job as income temporarily and in 3 months apply to biology jobs again (I couldn't get time to interview while working the lab tech job as harvest is crazy busy time) while hemmoraging my savings, or hold out for the potential of getting a biology job even though that could take 2 to 3 months easy.

I am going to call the federal loans monday to have them put into forebearance, but will private loan companies do that? I don't want my mom, the cosigner (lives across the country so can't really help besides a hundred bucks here and there) to get screwed over.

personalfinance,I just got my first paycheck and I have no clue how to budget it properly. Can you guys help me out?,"Hey PF!

I recently started a job and am a new graduate from University. My current job pays me $17/hr with $25.50/hr for overtime, although they try to regulate how much overtime we can do as the company has hired us through a contracting company. 

I get paid weekly, which is great! Depending on how often I work, my paycheck will be fluctuating a lot. 

My first week I worked 39 hours and 35 minutes, which is less than the desired time I would like to work.

My paycheck was for $672.86, out of which $136.90 was taken out for taxes, which is broken down as follows -:

Fed Witholding - $85.42

Fed MED/EE - $9.76

Fed OASDI/EE - $41.72

I should note that I am not married and am a single person household with no dependents. 

I'm primarily looking for advice since I don't have my parents to help me. They disliked the fact that I decided to move out and have since then cut off all contact with me and are refusing to even acknowledge that I exist, so I'm all alone and confused about what is going on.

At the present moment, I have to pay $900/month for my rent, plus bills for electricity and internet, along with transportation, which is roughly $25/week.

I have made myself a small budget of how much I want to put towards food, and how much I want to put it my savings/retirement fund.

I calculated how much I had left over from my first paycheck and it's a sad $85.96, as I took out $450 to pay for half my rent. I have a payment towards my security deposit of $450 due on August 15th and of $450 due on August 31st, plus ~$453 for rent as I moved in on a date that wasn't the 1st. 

The second week I have worked 40 hours + 3 hours and 35 minutes of overtime, which means my paycheck should come out to $680 (from the 40 hours) + $91.375 (overtime), which is a grand total of $771.375 of $771.38. 

From my calculations, they are charging me 20.35% tax on every paycheck, which means my second paycheck will have $156.97 taken out for taxes, which will leave me with $614.41, out of which I wanted to take out $450 for rent, which would still leave me with $164.41 to allocated towards bills, rent, utilities, and food.

I'm not the kind of person who goes out a lot, so I don't have to worry about a lavish lifestyle and spending too much money. In fact, I've been trying to conserve money by unplugging everything when I leave home and keeping the AC off almost the entire time I am home, except for 4 - 5 hours a day for when I sleep at night. 

I am considering allocating 10% of my budget towards savings, 20% to food, and the remaining will be split between utilities and bills. I'm not really going to be spending any money on going out or vacations etc.

I was hoping you guys could help me come up with a better way of budgeting myself without having to go completely poor and not being able to afford anything. I don't really have anyone to turn to as my family has cut me out of their lives and I can't turn to them for assistance. 

Thanks :)",finance,1437876810
personalfinance,Should I sell or keep the car?,"Hi personal finance, 

I'm currently debating on whether or not I should sell my currently financed car and buy a used one with cash. 

I bought the car this February for 12000. I needed an SUV to move to another state. It is a 2008 Mercury mariner. I currently owe 10875 on it. The car value is 10500. I pay 215 a month with a 7% interest rate. The car has about 65K miles on it. 

My husband and I start college here next month. Our tuition and books are paid in full already. We are receiving about 5K in federal grants each come financial aid dispersement. 

I am interested in selling the car, paying off the loan, and using the grant money to purchase a 2002 Honda CRV with 150K miles for 4500. I then want to put that 215 a month into a savings account. 

We currently also own a 2000 Ford Taurus with 90K miles that is completely paid. I'm not worried about maintenance costs on an older car because my husband works in a mechanic shop and is going to trade school for his ASE certification.

personalfinance,Minimal student loans now + investment vs debt-free,"Alright PF, I love this sub and have read a lot of the resources, especially for those around my age, but I'm in a somewhat unique position and questioning what my strategy should be. I'm entering college fall of 2016 (just over a year from now), coming from a fairly moderate middle class background. Traditional advice would be that I should save as much as possible for college right now, and get as far through as I can on that before taking on any loans.

However, I'm in a somewhat odd position where it's almost certain that I'll be independently earning somewhere comfortably into 5 figures doing work in technology over the next year-18 months, all while my living expenses are essentially zero. I've essentially just been saving everything at this point as cash in a savings account that is earning next-to nothing. My family has maintained really good credit, so interest on loans would be as low as loans can be had for right now, which is very low. However they also haven't saved much of anything for my college.

Assuming that the fed doesn't raise interest rates dramatically, does it make more sense to save this money as cash in savings accounts where it's earning almost zero interest, or invest it and forget about it for 10 years while also taking on low-interest debt in college?

I'm going to be continuing on a career path in technology/finance, so paying off debt will not be an issue.",finance,1437879460

personalfinance,(DE/EU) Advice on mid/long term investment,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I would like to seek your investment/planning advice:

**Background:**

I am an EU national with studies, a good job and currently good prospects/offers due to specialization in a niche field with a huge deficit of skilled workers. I am married to an American. We are both in our **early thirties**, and currently living in the Frankfurt am Main area, **Germany**. I am not a German speaker, but my spouse is getting there, slowly. My spouse left university to come live in Europe, hence higher difficulties to find a good job. As a side note, sadly there are no universities close to where we live that teach in English.

**Assets &amp; income:**

**Dual income no kids** (for now, but kids are not out of the question). We are raking in, give or take, **8k Eur**. a month, with me making about 6k of that. We have **no debt** and a **fully paid for car** that is still going strong after 9.5 years (the benefits of German engineering, I guess). 

**~250k Eur. uninvested, in a savings account**, due to the possibility of ""leaving in the next X months"" (I am not on a stable contract, which will change in the next 6 months, by law, either I get a permanent position or I am to be let go November next year, so far the feedback is positive). I have tentatively accepted a job offer in a different country due to begin early next year, by then, I will know whether my contractual situation has been solved one way or the other.

I have both a state (not contributing anymore) and a **private retirement plan** with **80k Eur**. in it (**employer** does not match, but **has a fixed contribution of 12% of salary**, I can choose to put on my side more than the 'standard' 6% towards retirement, tax free). The plan can be cashed out (subject to taxes) / transfer to a different retirement plan (no taxes). I haven't consolidated the plans i.e. transfer state one to private one due to contractual uncertainty.

We got **healthcare covered** with both private and state insurance. 

I **inherited** half of an apartment in a different european country where part of my family lives (rent free, but takes care of land taxes and other expenses) due to the bad economy, hence, not going to sell/rent in the short term, although it could be a possibility in approx. 3 to 5 years. Value is estimated around 300k Eur. after a 30 to 40% drop in price since 2008.

**Expenses:**

**Current rent is 1k Eur**., including ancilliary costs, electricity, Internet. 

**Monthly expenses**, food, transportation, entertainment are around **~800 to 1k Eur.** 

Every once in a while we take a trip somewhere, or have unexpected expenses (e.g. buy us a pair of kindles, or a couple video games here and there), mostly for sanity, we don't really budget for this, as we live comfortably at the moment, but we are cautious spenders. Amounts on average in the past 5 years to around **4k Eur. / year**.

**Additional info:**

Whether we stay in Germany or not, we would consider moving to a bigger place/buying a home. I've read, and it makes sense, that house prices are a bit high at the moment due to the low interest rates and because the area where we live, Frankfurt and its surroundings, has seen a lot of job growth, mostly taken by expats, in the past 3-4 years, and it appears to be a sellers/renters market at the moment. Rent is quite high as well at the moment, due to companies around the area giving very generous allowances for short term (months to a year) rental. If I were to look for something like our current home, we'd end up paying **30% more**, monthly, costs excluded. 

We are **not averse to some risk**, but would be in a better position to take risks if/once contractual issues are solved. 

So, in general terms, I would like **advice on how to invest the money we currently have** to make the most of it towards our goals, while keeping an acceptable level of risk, (and as a bonus question, what are things to keep in mind in our current situation, short term contractual uncertainty)?

Our goals, by priority, would be to:

1. (if appropriate) **start investing in a home in 1-2 years**, 
1. **""living a little"" for a couple years** (e.g. travel, hobbies, etc.), which we haven't done that much so far, 
1. **settling down** (children?) 
1. **retire early** (55? I'm 35)

Don't want to keep thinking ""Everything looks good to me"" without a sanity check, and a bit of external advice.

Thank you in advance.",finance,1437915652

financialindependence,"[UK] Which option is better for FI? £100k deposit into first house, or invest £70k and use £30k deposit? Info inside","Hi. So for a bit of background info, me and my gf are 22 and going off to our first real jobs in a few months. She has £100k to her name and wants to use this as a deposit for a house.

Mortgage would be £150k to buy a £250k house. Interest rates in the UK are at 0.5% so you can get mortgages at about 3% or less.

&amp;nbsp;
Now what would be the better option is FI is the goal?

**Scenario 1**

Use the £100k as deposit on the £150k mortgage. This way you do not have to pay any rent and could also benefit from rising house prices.

**Scenario 2**

Only use £30k for a deposit and get a £220k mortgage. Still get capital gains froum house price increases and can invest £70k in whatever

&amp;nbsp;

Now im under the impression scenario 2 is the best option as long as I get returns over what I pay for the mortgage. For example if I can get 5% returns and the mortgage is only 3% I should opt for Scenario 2. Is this right? Thanks. Any other advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1437926921

* Fuel: $100
* Online services (Netflix, Google music, xbox): $25

Total Expenses +Loans: $2235

After tax Income: $3860

Surplus: $1625

My current Savings rate is $0 except for the 4% (+4% company match) to my 401k. 
I do participate in my company ESPP which buys quarterly at a 15% discount which I sell immediately for a little windfall, usually going towards loans.
I had stopped saving into my Cash/Emergency fund earlier this year to attack the car religiously. At the moment it has $19k in it. This does include my HSA savings account for medical expenses as well as my main checking account which is always kept above 1months total expense. 

Really everything is under control. Except that no matter how many scenarios I make, it will still take me a few years to pay things off. This is what I hate. Obviously the budget above does not include the fun money, or random expenses, so I will never be able to put the $1600 surplus all towards SL1. I am considering bumping my 401k contribution up to 6% (+4% match) for a nice even 10% annually. Also looking at bringing up my cash savings, possibly to bring my EFund up a bit more so my checking account is not included there. I am working with the GF to see how we can limit the food expenses. I will apply the ESPP selloff directly to SL1. My end of year bonus as well as Tax refund will mostly go towards SL1 as well.

Really I am I just looking for PF's opinion. If I can pay at least $1000/month on SL1, it will still take almost 6 years to pay off. then an additional 2 years to pay the rest off. Being aggressive like I was with my car was very exhausting. I felt like I was pinching pennies and not able to do anything fun. Yes, I do realize debt is the emergency, but it's still frustrating. I hate that I got myself in this much debt. 

Thanks for listening, and I am looking forward to some feedback!

*Edit:
I guess my actual question here is if anyone thinks it would be wise, considering the duration it will take to pay off loans, to maybe start looking at investments outside of 401k? Maybe something like the Vanguard Index fund or something similar. Also to possibly start saving for a home. I don't really have much of a financial goal other than to pay off loans right now.

Bitcoin,WHEN US equities markets correct.. Will bitcoin make a substantial jump?,"Let's be honest and straight with ourselves. The US Equity markets are well above what they should be, one primary reason being the continued influx of fed $ pumped into them over the last several years.. $4+ trillion has been dumped in to prop up the markets as our economy continues to sputter along with weak economic growth and in more recent quarters we've seen gdp gains revised to show negative growth (I wonder how that happened! Corrupt cronyism? Bunch of crooked politicians). So, a correction will come.. how much? I don't know. Could be slight near term or much larger and really tank the global markets. 

So, what's the best guesses everyone has as what will happen to BTC prices? Massive gains? More stability, less downside? Or...the beginning of the real title wave that takes these sky high? I am honestly asking this question as I think it'll go up, but not sure how much. I know the key is more and more merchant growth with increasing consumer awareness/confidence in the technology. 

Potential risks could be Obama/Congress seeing the shift and cracking down on it full force. Again, this is only a case for more adoption and less reliance on the central banks and govt. The government can impede growth, but not kill it. Power of the people can trump this obstacle and I think a huge power grab will only fuel the fire to move away from govt back currency In a world of out of control government spending and regulation.

I called capital one to let them know that it was fraud, and they said that they would have me fill out some kind of form, and that my account will be credited.

personalfinance,Building credit/getting a bed. Small loan? Credit card?,"Brief run-down: 

While my credit score is pretty good, I am interested in making it better. My biggest issue is that I don't have many open lines of credit. I've had and paid off a few loans here and there but have never owned a credit card.

I have enough in my savings to cover myself in case of an emergency but am also in dire need of a new bed (mattress, frame, sheets, bedding, all that). I'm generally very ""safe"" about loans and purchases in general... but the mattress is bad enough that it is impacting my rest and then my work. For these reasons, I'm willing to take on the associated risks of getting a loan or placing this amount on a credit card.

My perspective on getting a loan: Not much of a risk factor but maybe not as good for my credit.

My perspective on getting a credit card: I feel like this is a risky move but the benefits could be worth it. Specifically, a lot of cards offer no interest rate for the first year... paying it off within that time period is realistic for me and would save me some money on interest that I would otherwise be paying for on the loan. Also, cash back stuff. I've also heard of some incentives for putting x-amount on the credit card within the first few months. Any suggestions on credit cards that might be useful in my situation would be much appreciated... just starting to research them.

personalfinance,Husbands car is a money drain. Need help figured out where to go from here financially.,"TL;DR husband's car is becoming too expensive to maintain but we need a car urgently. what to do?  
 
My SO took out a loan to buy a used 2002 Mini Cooper for $7000 (interest rate of 3.24%) in February of this year. The car has 80k something miles on it currently. When he bought it, the only issue he was made aware of was the AC not working. He has only had this car for 5 months and it has cost us over $3000 already and will continue to cost us.   
His car is unable to pass the safety inspection here due to it's current issues and is therefore not even legal to drive at the moment which is another headache in itself. Here is what is currently wrong with the car that I am aware of:  

* The driver's side door does not open from the inside. 
* The driver's side window does not roll down
* AC does not work. Adding fluid made no difference
* The clutch is beginning to slip. 
* The steering column shakes when braking. Realistically we would need to replace the rotors I believe.  

As of right now, he owes about $5700 on it still. Essentially, we've payed over $600 a month in maintenance on top of his $180 car payment. Not to mention that fixing this car has proven to be very expensive due to it being a Mini Cooper. He is in the military and we are in Hawaii so please factor in our very high cost of living. We need a car that will last the four years we are here and we can get a new car when we return to the mainland. Are we better off attempting to trade in the car and rolling over the debt into a new (smaller) loan? I also have the option of borrowing money from my family to pay off the loan and pay them back with no interest but I am a bit reluctant to do that. We could then get a used car from the lemon lot on base as people leave their cars behind here due to the fact that the military will only pay to ship one car to the continental US. We need at least one car because we live about 25 minutes from the base. I am a three minute walk from where I work.  

I will include below a summary of our financial situation.  
 
Monthly income (not including my income as I don't start working until next month) =  about $5200  
Rent including all utilities = $2100  
Cell phone = $190  
Gas = $150  
Food = between $300-600  
Car payment = $180, but he is ahead on payments until November.  
Car insurance = $700 every 6 months  
Donation to his church = $100  
Spotify, netflix, other subscriptions = $60 a month  

I hope I included everything there. We have no other debt except for the car. Currently have close to $3000 in savings and $7000 in my Roth IRA. If our ages are relevant, we are 20f and 22m. If you can think of something we are not factoring in, please let me know. We would end up with close to $1500 left over after necessities are paid if it wasn't for the cost of maintaining his car.  

I guess to summarize everything, is it fair to assume it is in our best interest to get rid of this car ASAP and eat the loss of what we owe on it still? I don't think we can get more than $2000 trading it in.",finance,1437957820

personalfinance,Extreme Measures To Get Out Of debt,"I'm currently in debt with a mortgage and student loans. The mortgage is affordable and only a bit higher than I would be paying rent, but the student loans are killing me. My current monthly income and payment situation is:

Net income: $3550  
Mortgage: $1335  
Federal student loan: $475 (financed for 30 years)  
Private student loan: $86  
Cell phone (w/unltd data): $100  
Utilities (gas/water/electric): $150 average  
Car insurance: $50  
Credit card: paid off each month w/limited use  
Savings deposit: $400  
Food: $500  
Entertainment/Home DIY/Other:$650  

I'm working on reducing the last two categories by cooking more managing my entertainment/other spending.  

6% of salary goes into 401k with a 3% match. Currently 80% vested with a balance of $38,000.
I bought my home for $155,000 and the balance of the mortgage is $135,000. I could most likely sell it for $170,000 right now based on neighborhood comparable sales.  

I had an idea that would get me completely out of debt. If I sold my house and got $170K for it that would be roughly $35K in my pocket (minus closing/fees). Mortgage now gone. I could cash out my 401k once I'm 100% vested in June 2016 and take the early withdrawal penalty. I've estimated that would net me between $25K and $30K. I will have about $20K to $25K in savings next year also.  

My student loans right now total roughly $85K. If I take the money I get from selling my house, cashing out my 401k, and wiping out most of my savings I could pay off the student loan debt. At that point I'm debt free. I still have the same monthly income, but at this point I can now save at least $1K per month and get my savings back to where it was.The 401K will be starting over, but the interest saved on the student loans over the next 28 years will be much more.  

Any thoughts on this? Does it make sense or does it seem a little too extreme?

Private student loans interest rate: 2%/4%    
Mortgage interest rate: 4.625% (looking to refi if rates get back below 4%. Missed it this time.)

What should I do?","I was attending a top 50 private university where my financial aid / academic scholarships completely covered tuition through a couple of grants, subsidized/non subsidized federal loans, and academic scholarships. It was a poor choice for my major, but my father 'compelled' me to go as it had the highest cumulative ranking offering to pay for room and board one quarter at a time as long as my grades were good. 

During the 1st quarter I became severely depressed, started self harming, developed an amphetamine/cocaine addiction, and would binge drink at social events and alone, scraping by with a 2.9 GPA
 
Second Quarter my GPA ended up at 0.9. Addictions led to heart problems and $800 in medical bills (I have yet to pay) and I was dismissed from the university on academic grounds. Dad didn't pay the 2nd quarter housing/dining/ or insurance bill that totaled just over $8000. I owe this directly to the university at 10% interest compounded monthly. On top of that I have no idea what I already owe on the federal loans or when payments are due considering my academic dismissal. 

Early in the 2nd quarter I signed a lease for the next year on the assumption that I wouldn't flunk out of college my first year and have to move in with my cousin who lives literally 1000 miles away from where the lease/ex-uni is located. The only community college near by will charge me $450 per credit because I'm not legally a resident of that city.

I had average grades in high school with a mix of IB/AP courses and excellent extra curriculars, now I don't know how or if its even possible to get back into a top school. And even if I could I'm no longer eligible for federal financial aid and most likely private scholarships because of my grades. As far as private loans: I don't know my credit score, have no idea how to get a loan, and even if I did, I have no one to cosign.

She has limited credit, but all good.  1 credit card opened in April, 2 car loans, one she owes 1700 on a car with a retail value of 7900 at 3.9%, and a loan for 17,500 on a 24,000 car at 3.25%.  Pays credit card off every month.  1 student loan with a balance of $2,700, paid ahead to Oct 2015 currently.

She has been paying $350 a month on her student loan and at this rate will be paid off by the end of the year.  She has also been saving +/- $1000 a month.

She has been looking for a house for the last few months and wants to buy a duplex that has been foreclosed on, fix it up and rent the other side to cover the mortgage.  I am a realtor that lists foreclosures and have a great network for this type of situation, so I have no concerns there and have also been a landlord.

We found  house that if we leverage bother her cars at full value, and I kick in some funds we can pay cash for and her savings account can cover repairs and the increased car payments easily.  The $24,0000 car would have an interest rate of 1.99% with refi (special offer to transfer loan) and the $7900 car would be at 5.99%-her credit took at hit when she financed the new car in May because of the high balance loan and minimal other credit.

After 6 months seasoning, she can cash out refi on the house.  She is preapproved, but at a higher rate, hoping another 8 months or so of credit will improve her score since the reasons so far are low number of accounts and short credit history, however even where she is approved, the payments are what I established below.  The appraisal at that point should come in about 70k +/-.  If the number is 70k, she could cash out up to 56,000.  This will pay off all of her debt, including paying me back.  With taxes and insurance figured into the payment, the house payment would be around the 400-450/month depending on interest rates at the time.  

The expected rent for the unit she is going to be renting out will be in the 450 +/- range, so the mortgage will be covered and her only expenses will be her regularly recurring bills, covering vacancy on the unit, and covering maintenance on the house and the two cars.  Her savings account should be able to grow at the rate of around $1800 a month at this point and there will be a separate account for the house that will be fully funded at  $5000-7000 for house repairs/upgrades.

This all seems too good to be true.  Is there something that I am missing in this equation?  Her long term plan is to pay extra on the mortgage and continue to save and buy rental properties with the savings, and eventually hire a property management company to handle the units as it grows.  

She did not finish college, and right now has no desire to.  She is currently managing a restaurant and bartending.  We talked about this plan since I don't believe this is a job that she will be able to do long term when she wants to start a family and so forth, and I never want her to be fully dependent on someone else (ie-her future husband).

personalfinance,Dealing with a Spousal/joint consolidation loan - stuck in loan purgatory.,"I'm asking for a relative who, at wits end, is asking family for help and advice.

My brother-in-law and sister-in-law both graduated from college in the early 90's and shortly there-after got married.  After several years of marriage and months of struggling to make payments, they were talked into a spousal/joint consolidation loan.  The original loan amount was around $71k and they got stuck with an 8% interest rate.  Then, due to their income, they were able to get one of those income-based payment plans.  Over time, they've had to defer a few times and almost had to file for bankruptcy but have managed to keep the loan out of court and collections.

Fast forward to today.  The loan is unmanageable.  The original $71k has ballooned to over $125k (mostly due to fines and continually accruing interest) and still retains the 8% interest rate.  They cannot refinance/re-consolidate.  They are not eligible for any student loan forgiveness programs because the loan is a joint consolidation loan.

Because the loan is income based, they are required to resubmit their finances each year.  Recently, my bother-in-law got a job as an outside salesman.  The job requires a truck so he was told to go purchase one and bring in the loan paperwork.  The business promptly gave him a raise in the exact amount of the loan payment, ~$500/month.  Upon later submission of the annual review of his joint consolidation loan, the loan company raised his required payment to up over $700, due largely to the +$500 pay increase.

They cannot make payments and what little they do pay only goes to cover interest and fees.  I don't have their particulars however, I'm confident that on paper, most of the original $71k principle amount still exists in the loan though they've likely already paid twice the original amount.

Advice on the internet is sparse.  It appears that this particular loan appeared in the late 90's, trapped a lot of people, and then was removed in 2005/6.  What is left behind is a lot of people dealing with a consolidation loan that they cannot pay due to the high interest rate and cannot get rid of due to loan loopholes that prevent refinance or forgiveness.

While most of the people on the internet that are dealing with this type of loan are struggling because of divorce, my in-laws are happily married but are stuck in ""loan purgatory"" with this loan.

Each month the loan grows, each month they struggle to meet the minimum payment with no luck.  

Do any redditors out there have any advice that I can pass along on dealing with this?  They've been making payments on this student loan for just over 20 years.

personalfinance,"Paying off CC debt with lower interest loan, different situation than most.","I currently have about $8,000 in CC debt, most of it I racked up in college and buying stuff for my first house. I was having a lot of trouble paying them off because I kept buying things out of impulse. I finally made a decision to close some of the accounts with a remaining balance but keep my oldest account open so it wouldn't effect my credit history length. My oldest account has only been open about 5 years anyways. I dug through a lot of old post where people were asking about getting a loan to pay off debt. Most of the concerns were about racking up CC debt again after they are paid, and being stuck with even more debt from the loan. In my situation, my accounts are already closed and I am looking to get a loan with a smaller interest rate. Currently I am looking at an average interest rate of about 22% between my cards and about $6,000 in debt between them. 

I am engaged but none of this debt falls on my soon to be wife. We try to budget each month, but she is still in school and working as a server. Her income varies greatly from week to week. We do have a mortgage and a car loan together. We also have a 2 year old and our 2nd child is due in November. She is going to be quitting her serving job soon and we really need to tighten up our money. I have already done a few things to reducing spending like drop cable TV, lower our data plan for cell phones, use budget billing through our utility company, etc. I am averaging about $350 a month in CC payments, and I feel like I am getting nowhere the interest rate being so high. So in this situation, does /personalfinance think it would be a good idea to find a lower interest loan to pay off already closed CC accounts with extremely high rates? If I should, would lendingtree or spring financial, or any of that stuff I get in the mail be good to go with, or would I be better off going to a local credit union?

personalfinance,Thoughts on crowdinvesting?,"I was curious if any of you has some experience in crowdinvesting?
I'm currently thinking about starting investing into some companies (mostly startups) listed on various sites (conda/greenrocket for the curious) in my country (Austria).
Unfortunately I don't know anyone who could give me any advice on this topic, as this form of investment seems pretty novel for austrian community.

Basically you can invest 500-5000€ into a company as a loan and receive 4,5-5% annual interest rate for 10 years. After that you get the invested sum back + some growth bonus (if the company actually grew).
Other possibility are participation right (""Genussrecht"") - a kind of mezannin capital - where you get part of the company's profit each year (if they make profit; no interest rate).

I realize the value of such investments highly depend on the choice of the companies, but the online platforms seek to offer only the potentially sucessful companies, as they charge 15% of the growth bonus.

Main advantages for me: I can invest small amounts of money over longer time (still studying and doing some freelance jobs on the side).

personalfinance,Totaled the car I just got. Please help me,"Reddit, please help me before I start to lose control of my life again. I've suffered from depression for many years. I spent a lot of my life suicidal, angry and unhappy. 10 months ago I decided I needed to change my life around and had been doing pretty well. But recent events have really been taking a toll on me. I'm really really freaking out. 


I was working to save up money was actually doing pretty well. But in March I accidentally spilled water on my laptop, so I bought a new one with my credit card. I know it wasn't a smart decision but I figured I could pay it off in a few months no problem. I'm a Graphic Design major so I kind of need a computer.


In June my car's engine gave out. I didn't have enough money to buy a new one or get one at a dealer so my dad helped me out and bought me a used car for 6k with cash. I had about $1000 saved up and spent it all in a month, some for him and some for bills, and my credit card payment. Then two weeks ago I lost my job, but wasn't too worried because I quickly found another one; however, I don't start for 2 more days. So I've been unemployed for like 2 weeks and have no money left. Well yesterday I got in a car accident and totaled my car. I only have liability insurance because I couldn't afford full coverage and am now regretting that so much. Then my phone got lost at the accident...so I don't have a cellphone and will need a new one.


We're estimating the damage to the car will run me about $4-6,000. I don't have the money. My dad doesn't have money because he just bought me the car. I absolutely love this car and I want to fix it.


I called the bank, I have Navy Federal and they said I could do 3 things

1. Apply for a personal loan for $6k. Reason: pay back my dad
2. Apply for a personal loan for $5. Reason: auto repairs
3. Apply for a car loan, either dealer or private.

I don't have good credit because I just got a credit card like 6 months ago and I think my score is like 640. 
The problem with 1 &amp; 2 are that IF I even get approved I'll pay interest up the ass. The problem with 3 is that I don't want to buy a car from a dealer. I want to avoid that at all costs, and my car insurance would go even higher. Also, I have to have the car's VIN &amp; mileage for the loan.


I feel awful. I feel like such a burden on my parents. They helped me out, and I totally disappointed them. My dad is disabled so his income is only about $1300 a month so he can't really help me anymore. I was so excited to go back to school in the fall, and now I can't because I need to work to make money.

If I start to work full time for $9/hr I can make about $1300 a month. I don't have any bills except I owe $870 on my credit card, my phone bill is $100 (I help my dad with our family plan), and $115 for my car insurance. 

I'm freaking out. I'm going to try and apply for the loan but I know I'll just get denied. I don't know what I'm going to do. I need a car to get to work. I'm seriously considering stripping, or camming, because I'm so desperate for the money. I tried to look into selling a kidney but I have no idea how to actually do that in the black market. I don't really have anything to sell except this laptop, and an older kindle, and I have a xbox 360 but that's not really worth anything. I don't have an amazing skill set. I can do graphic design stuff, and I know how to make websites. That's about it. I really want to crawl into a hole and not deal with this :(

2) I can request to have the funds rolled over to an IRA (which I do not currently have).

My dad died unexpectedly on April 30th of this year. He didn't file my parents' taxes but he did request and get approval for an extension. He's done this for the past several years and I usually mark my parents' as ""will file"" in my FAFSA. This allows me to have it in by the priority deadline and then go back and fill in their stuff later. I am currently not a dependent so I file my own taxes and did so on time. At the time of his death we (My mom, brother, and I) believed that my dad had filed. However, when I went to import my parents' info using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool I found that there was no record for either my mom or my dad. I went to irs.gov and tried to request a transcript using both of my parents' SSN's and both came up with no records for the 2014 tax year. After going through their joint bank account we found they never got their return. At this point I am confident that my parents taxes were never filed. He worked for a temp agency but was laid off in October and I'm fairly certain that he was on unemployment for at least some time during 2014 so I'm not sure where to even get his W2 or other tax papers. I depend completely on federal aid (a combo of grants and loans) to pay my tuition and living expenses throughout the year.

I have a car loan with the following specs:

* Value of the car: ~$21,000
* Balance on loan: $17,000
* Interest Rate: 4.69%
* Monthly Payments: $350 (works out to $2.18 daily interest right now)
* My FICO credit score is 787

I'm considering refinancing the loan to get a cheaper interest rate, but had some questions first. I called my credit union, who is actually the same company holding the loan now, and they said they could refinance it at 2.69% for 60 months. Obviously this would be better than what I'm currently paying, even with the $80 processing fee they told me it would cost, however I work with a girl who got a loan for 0.99%, which is even more enticing. 

So my two main questions are:

* What's the best route for finding a good refinancing option, and would I be likely to get a better rate than the 2.69% my credit union offered?
* If I refinance my loan and the term is reset to 60 months, is there usually a fee for paying off the loan off quicker than that? Right now, I'm comfortably paying $350 a month and will eventually be able to up that to $450 or so, meaning I could have it paid off in 3-4 years.

personalfinance,"I think I acted too quickly - credit repair, loans, and collections - help!","tl;dr: I have a lot of financial happenings and just want to make sure I am taking the correct course of action. Dealing with collections, car loan, credit cards, and potentially some cash to distribute among my debt. Want advice on how to proceed, and should have asked sooner, but only recently discovered personal finance and all of its glory. I just want to better my score so I can eventually purchase a home with my fiance and not spend as much in interest. Please help.

I am 26 and (fingers crossed) on my way up. Credit Karma currently has me at 680, capital one credit tracker at 581, and I recently took out a car loan and Wells Fargo quoted me at 602. I am content with these knowing what it's been in the past. (Hovered at 530 for three years making only $18,000 working retail and not knowing what to do + no guidance). Several years back (in 2009-2011), my ex fiance opened a bunch of credit cards in my name, maxed them out, and never told me. Only after we broke up did I discover this, and began panic paying on everything. At that time, I made $12,000 a year, so I didn't make much progress. I also co-signed for a car loan (I don't want to hear it, I know shame on me) and have since paid off the extra amount owed to the collector. I do not believe this debt is on my report.

My dilemma is this: I see all of these ""pay to delete"" things on this subreddit, and all of my collections are paid-ish. Some I paid in full, some I did not, but received letters saying they are settled in full. Question 1: after I have made an agreement, can I go back in and request otherwise? I don't really have any bargaining chip for some of it, but I think even one or two coming off my report entirely may help. If I remember correctly, I had 9 total things in collections totally almost $20,000. I buckled down and paid some things off from my checking account, and the remainder, I took out a loan. The loan was for $10,000 a few months ago, and have since paid $2,000 on it. The interest rate on this is 7%.

I also just got a car loan with an outrageous interest rate of 15.5%, but, at the time, did not have the means to get anything else. (This was a necessity, as I need it for work and school, and I got an older vehicle with low mileage. Paid $10,000) I have been making double payments, and the second payment goes entirely to principal. Question 2: when would be a good time to refinance this? Would having a lump sum as a deposit help? I bank with a credit union and that is who my other loan is through, so I plan on going that route.

I have very little credit card debt, I have a number of cards, but only use one for the % cash back, and I always pay the balance in full by the end of my billing cycle/time bill is due. I have utilized the 0% apr transfer balance for a large purchase (needed laptop for school and student loan hadn't gone through yet). I plan on keeping all of my cards open, as they aren't really tempting and I don't ever keep a balance. Question 3: Is this a good idea? 

Finally, I'm in school (yay!) and working a 45+ hour week, so I have my hands full. All of my extra money is going towards my loans (minimum is $239 for car and $251 for collection loan). Question 4: Should I try to chip one thing away faster than another? Perhaps hit on what has the higher interest rate? Could I consolidate my loans when I refinance?

I am slated to make $33,000 this year, and that's with my minimum hours worked. I have been working overtime as much as possible, and I am selling a few things (potentially getting up to $10,000) to hopefully get rid of some debt. Question 5: if I do get any additional money from liquidating assets, how should I distribute?

I know this is not written very well, and I know that very basic information will give me very basic answers. I have done my best with what I have and with what I know, and am just seeking out advice as to how I should proceed. Like I said, I am only doing this to save money on interest and potentially be able to purchase a home. I am hoping to buy a house next fall, but understand that I may have to wait so my credit looks a little better. I appreciate any advice!",finance,1438051518
investing,What Fundamentals Affect Commodity Prices,"In the previous post I explained the basics of commodity investing. In this post, I’m going to explain exactly what fundamental factors affect commodity prices.

A Precursor
Commodity prices tend to rise and fall together, much like how stock prices rise and fall together. As the saying goes, “a rising tide lifts all boats”. If the entire U.S. economy is doing well, generally all stocks will go up. The fundamentals below impact all commodity prices.

Inflation
Inflation is a huge factor that can impact commodity prices. Thanks to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, all commodities are officially listed in U.S. dollars. Here are two important terms that you need to know

Nominal value
Real value
The nominal value of a commodity is the “official price”. If gold per ounce is at $1300 right now, then the nominal value is $1300. If inflation is 100% (a hypothetical scenario), then the nominal value of gold will also increase by 100%, doubling to $2600 per ounce.

The real value of a commodity takes into account for inflation. Let’s assume that gold is at $1300 an ounce. If inflation increases by 100%, the nominal value will increase, but the real value is exactly the same. There’s just more U.S. dollars chasing after the same amount of gold in this world!

As investors, we only care about the nominal value. Thus, when inflation picks up, commodity prices soar across the board! This is what happened in Germany with hyperinflation in the 1930’s – a loaf of bread cost a bajillion Marks (Germany’s currency at the time) to buy. The real value didn’t change (a loaf of bread is still a loaf of bread), but the nominal value exploded.

This is what happened in the U.S. during the 1970s (although it wasn’t as severe as it was in Germany). U.S. inflation skyrocked (14% per year), and commodity price spiked in the 1970s. Gold went from $30 an ounce to $600 an ounce.

Right now, we are seeing the early phases of inflation where inflation will pick up but has not started yet. Ben Bernake (Chairman of the Federal Reserve) has a genius solution to America’s economic woes – print money! That’s essentially the name of the game for his consecutive rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE). Sooner or later, this money printing is going to catch up to him (or us American taxpayers, actually) with huge inflation. And what happens when inflation hits? Commodity prices skyrocket.

Increased Demand, Decreased Supply
There is a fixed amount of supply in this world – it’s not like we can manufacture gold (alchemy!) or copper. On the other hand, demand is increasing exponentially. Can you imagine if every person in the world lived the way us Americans did! Considering the amount of stuff we waste each year (that’s how my relatives from Europe put it), the world’s resources would be depleted in a heart beat.

With developing nations increasing their standards of living, the world’s demand for raw materials such as oil and copper is outstripping supply. The Chinese are a huge buying force in the world – they are rebuilding their country after:

1800s: Britain literally robs China of all its gold and silver by drugging the entire nation with Opium (prior to the 1800s, drugs didn’t exist in China). It’s called The Century of Humiliation. China went from #1 in the world (literally, the “Middle Kingdom”) to dead last.
Early 1900s: Chinese Civil War
1950 – 1978: the Communist fiasco (Chairman Mao ruined China).
So really, China’s literally been rebuilding its entire country over the past 30 years. And because China is so big (both geographically and population wise), China consumes a ton of resources.

This trend in increasing demand and shrinking supply is only going to continue, thereby pushing up commodity prices. Factor in some more inflation thanks to King Bernake from the Federal Reserve, and you have the perfect set up for a long term bull market in commodities.

Wife wants to payoff Sallie Mae loans using multiple interest free credit card offers.,"I currently have a Sallie Mae (Navient) private loan balance of just under $16,000. Currently I am paying just over $200 a month which approximately $175 goes towards interest and almost nothing towards my principle. I could afford to pay a little more (maybe $400 a month) but with a 14.25% interest rate, I feel like I'm being robbed every month.


My wife has a plan to use a few of the multiple interest free (12-18 months) credit card offers that we've received to buy out the loan and start aggressively paying it off. After finishing  the interest free duration, we would transfer the balances again to other interest free offers and hopefully be done with the total sum in about 3-4 years.

I will begin my second year this fall and University A has a decent program for Computer Science and Information Assurance, but the college is rather small. I also have a well-paying job as a ~~Systems Administrator~~ Help Desk at a local business that is very flexible and pays me $13/hour with yearly bonuses and raises.

I am fucking miserable here. Furthermore, if I stay I will end up living with my deadbeat friends and abusing cannabis until I can no longer function.

I understand you may attempt to give me advice on these relationships, but that is unnecessary as this is not /r/relationships.

Additionally, I have about $10,000 in Federal Loans that I can take (I cannot get exact numbers due to the university website not allowing me to access this information past 10:00 p.m.). I do not presently qualify for any scholarships as I missed the deadline, but given my high grades and test scores, I should be eligible for them in the next few years, but this is still a gamble. I know that at University B I will legitimately be happier with a more defined college community, and a school where I feel I will actually be contributing to academia as a whole, rather than simply regurgitating knowledge. By that last part I mean it will be a significantly better college education, what a larger amount of potential networking.

So, I've been trying to combat financial stability with enjoying what everyone tells me is supposed to be ""The best time of my life.""

personalfinance,Did I make a mistake by paying to get out of my backwards car loan?,"Today, I sold my 2013 Chevy Cruze for $12,800. I owned the car for 2 years, and it was the first car I had purchased on my own. My situation is a pretty great one, or so I believe. The loan I had on the car was a 7 year loan with an 6.2% interest rate. The monthly payment was $345, I always paid at least $400. Recently I have been trying to increase my monthly income and figured I'd be better off getting rid of the car, but those around me don't believe selling the car was the right decision. I ended up with a payoff of about $17,200 thus forking out $4,400 in cash to close out the loan. I currently have a completely paid off car to drive and still have over $3,000 in the bank. I'm hoping that by getting rid of the car, I will be able to eventually buy a condo next year by saving $750 a month (car payment and insurance of $500 + $250 I currently save a month).

news,new therapy slows spread of deadly brain tumor cells,"The rapid spread of a common and deadly brain tumor has been slowed down significantly in a mouse model by cutting off the way some cancer cells communicate, according to a team of researchers that includes UF Health faculty.

　　The technique improved the survival time for patients with glioblastoma by 50 percent when tested in a mouse model, said Loic P. Deleyrolle, Ph.D., a research assistant professor of neurosurgery in the UF College of Medicine.

　　Researchers focused on disrupting the cell-to-cell communication that allows cancer stem cells to spread. To do that, they targeted a channel that cancer cells use to transfer molecules. By cutting off their communications pathway, the deadly cells stay in check, Deleyrolle said.

　　Eight UF Health researchers took part in the study, which was co-authored by Deleyrolle and published recently in the journal Cell Reports. They collaborated with researchers at the Cleveland Clinic and the University of California, Berkeley.

　　Glioblastoma is the most common brain tumor in adults and there is no effective long-term treatment and patients usually live for 12 to 15 months after diagnosis, according to the National Cancer Institute. Glioblastoma tumors, which are highly malignant, typically start in the largest part of the brain and can spread rapidly.

　　The research focused on connexin 46, a protein that is an essential component of cancer stem cells. Connexin 46 is part of intercellular channels known as a gap junction. That intercellular channel, which allows cells to exchange molecules and ions, is crucial to the growth of a glioblastoma tumor, researchers found.

　　""When we shut down those channels in the cancer stem cells, we can significantly reduce the tumor-forming abilities of the cells,"" Deleyrolle said.

　　Tumor growth was significantly delayed in mouse models that were treated with a combination of the gap junction inhibitor 1-octanol and a chemotherapy drug, temozolomide. After 100 days, all of the mouse models that had the connexin 46 protein suppressed genetically were still alive. By comparison, all of the mouse models that didn't have the protein suppressed died within two months.

　　While the technique has yet to be tested in humans, Deleyrolle said the implications are clear and relevant. For now, a glioblastoma patient can expect to survive about 12 to 15 months. Patients can also develop a resistance to temozolomide when it is used for chemotherapy, further shortening their life expectancy.

　　""Any significant increase in survival time will be a meaningful improvement because the current treatments provide only weeks of efficacy"" Deleyrolle said.

　　Another reason for optimism: All of the compounds that were tested as inhibitors are being used in humans or are in the clinical trial pipeline. Carbenoxolone is used in some European countries to treat ulcers, and 1-octanol is used as experimental treatment for tremor in the United States. That means that the amount of time needed to get the drugs into a clinical trial as a therapy for glioblastoma could be significantly shortened, Deleyrolle said.

　　Because gap junction inhibitors have ubiquitous functions in many organs and tissues, one of the next research steps is to determine the inhibitors' most effective and tolerable concentrations. It is also necessary to understand more about the mechanisms that make the inhibitors work, Deleyrolle said. Still, clinical trials could begin within a few years, he said.

　　Treating glioblastoma is especially difficult because its cells can vary drastically, even within a single tumor -- so breaking the chain of cell-to-cell communication is yet another potential weapon to fight the disease. If the new therapy is approved following a clinical trial, Deleyrolle said it would likely be put to use alongside traditional chemotherapy and radiation treatments.

　　Deleyrolle said he is seeking a new federal grant to continue translational research.

　　""When it comes down to treating such a complex disease, there isn't one magic bullet. You have to come up with complex, multiple approaches, he said.

personalfinance,Help me decide -- Sell house or rent it out,"(I originally posted this in /r/RealEstate, but thought that the folks here at /r/personalfinance might also have quality input.)

I am moving (but staying relatively local), and trying to decide whether to rent out my house or sell it.  Here are the facts:

* $2,666.98 loan payment: P + I + escrow (taxes + insurance)
* 3.5% interest rate (30 year fixed) 
* $328 HOA payment
* $455,000 remaining on mortgage

Here are some additional estimates I can offer:

* $650,000 approximate home value
* $3,500 approximate monthly rent I could charge

The way I see it, best case scenario, I have:

* $42,000 gross annual rent
* $35,939.76  gross annual expenses

This gives a positive cash flow of about $6k per year.  However, this also ignores vacancies and repairs, which could easily eat up that $6k and then some.  I'm not totally comfortable with budgeting for an arbitrary percentage for those expenses, but as a thought experiment, 5% vacancy and 5% repairs would cut my cash flow to about $1.8k (but it's still positive cash flow).

Of course, this strikes me as overly reductive, because in my expenses I've listed the full loan payment, even though some of that is going to principal and building equity.  So, if I remove the principal portion of my loan payment, I get positive annual cash flow of ~$16k, or ~$12k (again assuming 5% vacancy/5% repairs).

In sum, I see 4 ways to assess this investment:

* $6k cash flow; 3.11% ROI** -- ignoring vacancies and repairs and using all cash in (rent) minus all cash out (mortgage plus HOA)
* $2k cash flow; 1% ROI -- using 5% vacancy and 5% repairs
* $16k cash flow; 8% ROI --  ignoring vacancies and repairs and not counting principal payments as an expense
* $12k cash flow; 6% ROI --  using 5% vacancy and 5% repairs

I am really not sure which of these 4 is closest to the proper measure.  Obviously, 0% vacancy/repairs is unrealistic, but is 5% realistic?  Also, I am not sure how to consider the principal portion of the monthly payment.  Obviously, in one sense it is still an expense, because the money is leaving my hands every month.  On the other hand, it's not an expense because I am gaining an equal amount of equity with each principal payment.  In fact, in this sense the rental property would be a better investment as time goes on, because my payments would be going more and more towards principal.

Finally, note that my analysis has ignored appreciation of the property.  I think that's right for budgeting purposes, but wanted to point it out because at the end of the day it could have a significant impact.

** Note, for ROI, I am using the cash flow as the numerator, and my estimated equity (current home value minus the remaining mortgage) as the denominator.  I think this makes sense, because it is an evaluation of what else I could do with my stake.  Right?",finance,1438084704

I sought professional help which didn't do me any good. The medication did the exact opposite of what it was supposed to do. Long story short, I had moments of mania followed my depression. 

I had a job where I was able to study while working which was ideal for me. I worked 24 hours a week and that was enough to sustain me before all this went down.

personalfinance,Paying off mortgage in low interest rate environment,"Hello!

I'm outside of the US, but I'll convert to USD to simplify things.

I'm in my mid-20s and work full-time in a sector with quite good job prospects. I've had a mortgage for a few years now, but I haven't really been paying a lot of attention to it. I was brought up in a family where any kind of debt should be avoided at all costs, and if you end up with debt you should pay it off as soon as possible. With interest rates at the level they are now, I didn't think that was the best way to go.

My situation:
Post tax income of $2800-3000
Apartment worth $85000 at purchase, probably a bit more now
Mortgage of $58000@3% APR, with 30% tax rebate on interest (putting me at 2.1% EAPR?)
Utilities, HOA and so on of $340 per month
Paying off mortgage at $175 per month on top of interest
Savings of $17000 (primarily in low rate index funds)
$5500 emergency account (low by US standards, but I don't own a car, have universal health care and good unemployment insurance, so emergencies aren't quite the same)
Retirement savings of around $20000 or so. Can't access these until retirement.
No credit card debt
No personal loans

In the next few months I'll have a meeting with my bank to renegotiate my loan and payment plan, as the first few fixed rate years are about to end. 

Interest rates have dropped since I got my mortgage, so I'm likely to end up with a lower interest rate. Variable interest rates are around 2% at my bank at the moment, but I could also renew my fixed mortgage which would range from 2% for one year fixed to 3.4% for 10 year fixed.

These interest rates could probably be negotiated to a slightly lower level, and I could move my loan to another bank once my fixed-rate period ends for an even lower level. These rates are all before the tax rebate.

Since effective interest rates are so low, I have only been paying off at a rate of $175 for the past few years. My thinking is that paying off mortgage at 2.1% effective APR is basically the same as paying into a 2.1% EAPR savings account, which is likely to be outperformed by index funds long term, but there would be very limited liquidity in the mortgage.

My plan is to set up my new loan so that I'll pay the same amount (interest+paying off mortgage) I do now. That would mean I pay off my mortgage at a slightly accelerated pace of around $225 per month.

The way I've been brought up I'd want to pay off the mortgage as soon as possible, but I don't think that's in my interest long term. Is my thinking right, or should I change the way I'm dealing with my mortgage?",finance,1438086183

personalfinance,Trying to decide how much car I can afford,"Hi all! This is my first PF post, so my apologies if there is a thread like this somewhere. I was hoping to get advice on how much car I can afford.  
  
A few notes:  
-I would like to have a somewhat nice, new car. I just sold my 15 year old honda, and I would enjoy driving around a more modern, nicer car  
-I am not looking to max out my budget(looking for the *should* amount, not the *can* amount)
  
**Specifics**:  
-Recent Grad  
-Received a job offer of $55k (Currently negotiating to ~$58k-60K)  
-Have $1,200 in CC debt, $700 which I hope to pay off within a month of starting my job(the rest is still interest-free for 6 months, will probably pay off in 1-2 months)  
-$600 in savings   
-$26,000 in student loans (all federal, mostly subsidized. repayment in Janurary)  
    
Currently, my SO has been footing the bill for our expenses, during unemployment time, but that will change as soon as i accept an offer.   
**Expenses** are as followed:  

-$587.50/month rent (my half)  
-$90/month phone  
-$60/month electric (my half)  
-$45/month water/sewage/trash (my half)  
-$55/month minimum cc payments (will drop to $25 if i pay off the $700)  
-$20/month netflix/other subscriptions  
-$25/month for non-owner's car insurance with geico (will go up with car, but is a requirement in my state for a license)  

**TOTAL: $882.50**  

I realize that i'm missing some essentials (Food, gas, entertainment, etc....) but I wanted to list my hard expenses, since the others are somewhat variable.   

I've been really interested in buying a 2015 Camaro, and I think i can get a basic one for about ~19k-21k. I am looking at this as a hobby/enjoyment car, not necessarily just a functionality vehicle, as I had rove of those super reliable not-so-pretty, practical, paid-in-cash cars for the past 6 years. 


I would appreciate any input on if this is realistic, if i could afford to splurge a bit more (i.e. what a realistic max might be) or if i'm being too ambitious.

Thanks!  

**EDIT** Interest rate for student loan ranges from ~3% to ~6% with the average at 4.25%  

**EDIT 2:** Well, I've been mostly steered away from a Camaro. I think that you guys have all made valid points, so thank you for that. I mostly appreciate those of you with solid advice and not just ""you're so dumb"". I was truly looking for input, so than you. Additionally, I've been offered a different position at $65k, which I intend to accept, an while I don't think i'll go for the Camaro anyway, I think it does help ease my financial position.  

**EDIT 3:** So now I'm thinking about a honda accord or maybe a VW Passat. The new offer requires substantially more driving, so it'll be important to have a comfortable, fuel-efficient car. I will look at 2-3 year old models, but don't think i would want anything older than 5 years",finance,1438096308

personalfinance,(South Africa) Two Bonds - On which one should I pay extra?,"Hallo 
Thanks in advance to those able to assist.

* South Africa, so currency is in ZAR
* Interest rates is not the best, but fair for South Africa
* Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate (JIBAR) currently at 6.3% - SA homeloans interest rates linked to JIBA
* Both loans have other standard fees that I omit here

I have been making additional payments into my home loan every month for about 3 years now. I have saved quite a bit in interest and have a spreadsheet to show me how much I will save.

I have now purchased a second small property for my parents to live in (no rental income) and would like to do the same with that bond. Due to the different ages of the bonds, different interest rates and different capital amounts, paying additional amounts into one of the bonds would probably be more beneficial than paying equal amounts into both. (Perhaps until such a time that the interest due on the two bonds become equal?).

My question is: If I have R2000 to spare, would I benifit most by paying it into:
A) Home Loan A - as described below
B) Home Loan B - as described below
C) Some long term investment (I am already investing a small amount each month)




**Home Loan A:** JIBAR + 3.9%

* Original Capital Amount: R703 000
* Current outstanding: Aprox R585 000
* Now 39 months into bond
* Interest Rate: 10.2% (variable)
* Total Extra Payments to date: R69 500 (not a fixed amount every month)
* 166 months remaining if I make no more additional payments
* Normal monthly repayment: Varies, but currently at R6 500

Roughly calculated, I have cut approximately 35 months off the bond so far.

**Home Loan B** *(will only commence on transfer)* - JIBAR + 4.3%

* Original Capital Amount: R420 000
* 240 months to go
* Interest rate: 10.6% (variable)

I have no financial experience or qualifications, so please excuse any unclear info. I will provide more if needed. 
I may also be entirely on the wrong track by making additional payments. From my point of view I just see how much interest I end up not paying if I make additional payments.
Also, I understand cons of buying a place for my parents (financially and other). I can not let my parents live on the streets.",finance,1438099457

If you let your student loans get behind, here are some consequences for you *and any cosigners on your loans* (think of poor old mom and dad, or your little old grandmother who just wanted to see you succeed):

* Your credit score will drop. Because of this:

* It will become [difficult to rent an apartment](http://blog.readyforzero.com/what-is-a-good-credit-score-for-renting-an-apartment/), and even practically impossible to sign a lease at a certain point. Being homeless is not fun, living with mom and dad limits your job search, and finding roommates who have already signed a lease is a crapshoot.

* It will become [difficult to rebuild your credit](http://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/2012/04/11/how-long-past-due-remains/), as delinquent marks negatively impact your credit score for upwards of *7 years*. 


* You will not have access to many basic financial products, like [unsecured credit cards](http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/tips/secured-credit-cards-vs-unsecured-difference/). If you have an emergency, you will have to hope that your parents can help you because you won't have credit. Some credit cards offer perks like cash back, warranties, or airline miles. If you can use credit cards responsibly, that means cheaper travel, or everything you buy essentially being 1.5% cheaper, for example. 

* You might be denied further student loans for quite some time, putting limitations on your career and future that you probably don't want. Furthermore, refinancing your student loans to secure a lower interest rate or consolidating to lower your monthly payments may not be an option any more because of higher interest rates or outright rejection.

* If you find yourself in a better position in a few years, you will pay the price in [higher interest rates](http://www.myfico.com/CreditEducation/Calculators/loanrates.aspx) on anything from auto and home financing to personal loans and credit cards.

* Before you are able to get on track with your loans again, you will have to pay back what you have missed so far. $350 is much easier to find than $2000. Meanwhile, the monthly payments your missing are being added to that dreadful past-due amount. If you are not able to get current on your loans, you will [default](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/default), and they will eventually be [charged off](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit/what-does-charged-off-mean.aspx), which will further damage your credit score. Additionally,

* Unpaid debt that has been charged off has typically also been sold to a collection agency. Guess what looks really bad on a credit report? Accounts in collections. [Collection agencies aren't polite](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0149-debt-collection). They call you constantly, send you letters, and can even sue you and garnish your wages. Very stressful on top of the stress of being poor.


This means that a single unpaid student loan account can negatively impact your credit in *3 different ways*. These are dirty details that future rental companies, credit card companies, [insurance agencies](https://www.esurance.com/info/car/myth-your-credit-score-doesnt-affect-your-insurance-rate), and banks will see and use to protect themselves from risk if they look at your sordid credit past. And to top it off, you could be looking at knocking off *100* points or more from your credit score.

Bad news bears.

If you cannot afford your student loan payments right now, there are solutions.

**CONTACT YOUR LOAN SERVICER.** This is really the only piece of actionable advice you need. Your loan servicer will help you figure out what you need to do. Loan companies like to make money, and you're not helping them out with that if your account has been charged off and sold at a discount. Your loan servicer will have options for you that may include:

* Deferment. Your payments are postponed for a certain period of time. Subsidized loans do not accrue interest. Eligibility requirements are based on things like unemployment (or underemployment), returning to school, financial hardship (nebulous, I know), disability, and military deployment.

* Forbearance. Similar to Deferment. Interest will capitalize during the forbearance period. There are slightly different eligibility requirements, including: medical residency, service programs like Americorps, or low income.

There is a time limit on both of these options. [Here's some more info about deferment and forbearance](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/deferment-forbearance). 

* Different repayment options. Some are income-based. You may be able to get a lower monthly payment at the expense of extending the term of your repayment and owing more interest. You may also be able to enroll in a program where your payment increases gradually as the years go by.

personalfinance,Is installing solar using PACE financing a good idea?,"Hi /r/personalfinance...

I'm considering installing a rooftop solar system for my home, and I want to see if financing the installation through the PACE program is a good idea (and whether solar is a good idea for me in the first place).  I'd LIKE to have solar (going green and all that), but one of my primary restrictions is that I don't want to purchase solar unless I can at a minimum break even.  All things being equal I'd prefer solar, but I'm not willing to make an unwise financial decision to get it.  Other goals include lowering my future power bill as prices go up, and improving the value of the home.

I live in sunny Sacramento California, and I have a southern-facing roof.  Some of my roof real-estate is shaded by a tree, but the solar installer says there should be enough un-shaded area for an appropriately sized system for my power needs.  

Because I live in Sacramento and get my power from the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District (SMUD), my power bill is actually quite low as it is when compared to PG&amp;E customers just a short distance away.  My average power bill over the last 2 years (the entire time I've lived in the home) has been right around $140/month.  I hit ~$200 or so in the summer for months where we use the AC a lot.

The solar system I was quoted has an MSRP of $19,000, and the installer has offered me $12,000 for the full installation with all taxes, labor, fees, etc included.  The warranty for the panels is 25 years.  The Federal tax credit would knock an additional 30% off, bringing my total cost to $8400.  The expectation is that this solar system should lower my power bill by ~60% by keeping me out of Tier 2 and 3 pricing.

Clearly with my super-low power bill, this is a difficult proposition.  I only spend ~$1680/year on electricity, so I should hypothetically save about $1000/year.  If I buy the system outright, it'll take almost 9 years to break even (less I suppose since power prices should increase).  I'm not planning to live in the house that long if I can help it (probably no more than 5 more years).  One of my primary concerns is that I want it to be easy to move.  The worst case is that I'd need to pay off the solar system using equity from the sale, or take a loan with short enough terms that I can just have it paid off.  Unfortunately this means that I would shoulder the full investment without staying long enough to see the return.  For the same reason, just paying cash for the system doesn't seem like a great idea.  The caveat would be if the solar system would add enough value to the home that I'd recoup my investment when I move; I've read some data suggesting like home value increase of ~97% of the cost of the system in California, which sounds great, but I'm unsure.

However, one option is to buy the solar system using PACE financing - with PACE, the homeowner basically gets a loan from the city or county or state, and repays the loan through increased property taxes.  Unlike a traditional loan, if I move, the system and the associated debt stays with the house as part of the property taxes (no credit checks or anything like that; the new owner just continues to pay the proeprty taxes until the loan is repaid).  The interest rate is higher (I believe 7%), but according to the solar installer it's also tax deductible since it counts as ""taxes paid.""  Since I wouldn't need to have the system paid off before moving, I could stick with a long term of 20 years for the payoff.  This means I would pay for the solar system while I live in the home, but would only need to pay the full cost if I actually stay in the house.  I was quoted around $70/month for the cost of the system using this financing, which puts me just slightly better than break-even from a monthly expenditure perspective - $70/month for the solar system, plus 40% of my average bill ($140) works out to $126/month.  And since the payments themselves would be built into my property tax bill, they'd be tax deductible and therefore save more (which somewhat makes up for the bad interest rate).  I make good money and that puts me in a somewhat high tax bracket, so this sounds attractive to me.

Of course @ $70/month for 20 years that's a total payment of $16,800, which is significantly worse than the original cost.  Even if it's tax deductible and I can knock (just a wild estimate) 20% off of that, it's still over $13,000.  That's a long time to wait for a return @ $1000/year in power savings.  I'm just not sure whether I should care, if I plan to move out in the next 5 years and on a monthly basis I expect a slightly lower total average bill.

So I have a few questions:

1) Is it dumb to be looking at this from the perspective of monthly expenses as opposed to just looking at the ROI?

2) Is the solar installer lying to me or mistaken about the payments being tax deductible using PACE financing?  Because that sounds too good to be true.

3) Would building the cost of the system into the property taxes make the home more difficult to sell?   Part of the point of using this financing would be to make it easier to move in ~5 years without needing to worry about paying off a loan in full that I haven't yet had a chance to see a return from.

4) Is there any other reason PACE financing or even any solar installation would be a bad idea for me given my power bill and how long I plan to stay in the house?

5) Would it be a better idea to just go with regular financing for a long-ish term for the better interest rate (3-4%), and then just pay off the loan using equity from the house when I move with the expectation that the house's value will improve by nearly the full cost of the system?

6) Is there anything else I'm just not realizing?",finance,1438102926

Hoping some of you can help me devise a plan-- I'm looking for the most effective way to pay off my loans early with the least possible interest. 

I have all private loans through Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) and have very high interest rates. I've already consolidated. I have a 25 year term. I can afford (a little) more than my minimum payment. 

I took out around $65,000 between 2004 and 2009 for a bachelor's degree, total payoff as of today is $100,772.01. I did take 2 years of deferment from 2011 to 2013 while I was getting my master's degree. When I started payments back up in 2013 my minimum payment was $889 and I have paid $950 each month on time since then.

It's split into 6 individual loans, I'll list them with their current payoff followed by their individual interest rates: 

$25,653.44/	9.75%

$9,167.19/	        5.25%

$6,201.62/	        6.25%

$22,222.77/	9.75%

$15,427.01/	9.75%

$22,099.98/	9.75%


I'm continuing to pay $950 each month and allocating the extra money pretty evenly among all the individual loans (slightly heavier on the 9.75% loans). For instance, this month my minimum is listed as $366.55, so I'll have nearly $600 to allocate however I choose.

Anyway-- should I continue the way I'm going? I can't really afford much more than $950, so what can I do with that money to be as effective as possible? Should I continue to allocate it evenly or should I attack 1 loan at a time until they're each paid off? Would I be better off asking a private bank to buy out my loan so that I can try for a lower interest rate (someone suggested this recently but I don't feel like that's a good idea)?

personalfinance,When to refinance a very high interest auto loan?,"Hi PF,

**TL;DR: My credit was around 540 when I purchased a used car a few months ago resulting in a very high interest loan. It has moved up to about 610 since then, when should I refinance?**

Backstory: Basically, I got laid off last year and couldn't make my auto loan payments. I had three that were ""past 30 days overdue"" which brought my credit from the mid 700s to the mid 500s.   
  
I started my new job 6 months ago and I'm making decent money (much more than I was before, yay) but it was a long commute, so once I got caught up, I traded my F150 for a 2013 Focus, resulting in a stupidly high interest rate but a lot better mpg. I went forward knowing that the gas money I would save could be dumped into the car loan to pay it off faster and that hopefully at some point I could refinance.
  
Now, I've checked my credit again after four months and it's gone up about 50-60 points to the low 600s. So I am thinking maybe I can refinance sooner than I had originally thought. What's the optimal time? Is my credit going to keep recovering this quickly?",finance,1438110216

The full story:
I just moved to North Carolina from South Carolina a couple of months ago. Neither my license nor my tags have expired. I go in today to get my SC drivers license changed over to an NC license, only to have the DMV worker say that there is a hold on my license in SC.
  
I call the SC DMV, they say it is because I don't have insurance. I do, though. I updated my address and policy to work in NC, sure, but it was set up to insure my SC plates with my SC license, and the same car. The SC DMV employee informed me that they sent me a LETTER a month ago, notifying me that my insurance expired, and then they put my license on hold since I didn't call them with the update. I moved, so the letter went to my old address! Like a responsible human being, I left a forwarding address with the US Postal Service before moving. The DMV worker informed me that federal mail does not get forwarded, though, so I never knew a thing about this until I got a lovely surprise during my attempt at getting my NC license.
  
Now SC wants to charge me $250 to reinstate my license because they made absolutely no further attempts to contact me, even though they have 2 other forms of contact on file (email and phone).

I’m ineligible for the US federal student loans because the university isn’t one of the international universities covered and I’m ineligible for the Dutch student loans because I’m not from the European Economic Area.

As far as the money, I currently have $20,000 in US federal student debt from my bachelor's and am looking at about €30,000 total between tuition (€14,000), cost of living (€12,000), and transportation/miscellaneous expense (€4,000).

personalfinance,How is my plan to get out of all this debt?,"So, I have been reading on this sub for a while and working to get my personal finance under control.  Having just graduated from college in May, I have a lot of debt.  Some of it is definitely due to my own immature frivolous spending habits and living beyond my means, but a significant portion is just the result of 4 years of college with minimal financial aid or time to work. Here's the breakdown:

Student Loans  
$35466 - Stafford loans, varied interest rates, roughly 1/3 subsidized  
$12000 - Sallie Mae private loan, variable @ 2.75%, currently in grace period  
$16000 - Sallie Mae private loan, fixed @ 7.5%, currently making interest only payments  
$12000 - Credit union student loan, fixed at 9.5%  

Credit Cards  
Capital One - ~7500 @ 20.9% - ouch!  
Capital One - 500 @ 0% for 12 more months, then 19%  
Citi - $1400 @ 0% for 7 more months, then 18%  

Car loan  
~$2000 @ 4.9%, $164/month for 12 more months  

Now the good news: Due to advice in this sub, I have been sticking to a strict budget and have already saved up $2k in cash as an emergency fund, and knocked ~$1500 off my highest interest CC debt.  I have just accepted an offer for a full time job making $37900 annually.  I graduated with a BS in Biochemistry and it is a research technician position with a prominent lab, so it is very relevant to my future career.  I intend to work for 2-3 years and then pursue a PhD in biosciences.  I also currently work as a per diem employee at a healthcare facility, making $16.60/hr.  I intend to stay on with this employer and work 1 weekend per month, which adds $3100 to my income for a total of $41k.  I estimate that after pension contributions and taxes/healthcare, my take home will be ~$2600.  

I am working on refinancing some of the private loans, the 12k at 9.5% and the 16k @ 7.5% to $28k @1.9%V, capped at 6%.  This should go through later this month.  

I recently moved home with my parents, and I don't need to pay rent, groceries, utilities, or cell phone bills.  Here is my current budget:

Car Payment: $164  
Car Insurance: $85  
Gas: $225  
Student loan payments: $270  
Entertainment: $150  
Coffee: $20  
Resturants: $60 (eat out once a month)  
Gym: $20  
Misc Expenses: $200  
Credit Card minimums: $100  

Total: $1294  
All excess income (~$1300) goes to the highest interest debt.  

Once my public loans go into repayment, I intend to put them on the PAYE plan.  This will make my payments minimal.  My current job is with a non-profit, so I qualify for public service loan forgiveness.  I will get 2-3 years of payments here, then probably 3 as a post doc, and only have a few left for the 10 year forgiveness (provided that I continue to work in public service jobs).  The state that I'm in also has a program where the state picks up your payments for you for 2 years if you're on the PAYE plan and make less than $50k, which I intend to utilize.  

My strategy will be to pay down the CC debt first, starting with the $7500 at 20.9%.  I will then move to the private, variable loans.  I hope to work for at least 2.5 years at this rate and stick to this budget, in this time I hope to be able to clear up all the CC debt and most of the private loan debt.  Then I will go to graduate school, where my public loans can go back into deferment and I will be able to live off a graduate stipend, which would not be possible with my current debt burden.

personalfinance,Auto Finance Arrears Notice (x-post AusFinance),"Hi everyone of PF,

I have a secured personal loan with a popular Australian Auto Finance lender for some $30,000 over 7 years. I got the loan when I was quite a bit younger and understand now that the interest rate etc was not as great as it first appeared.

&amp;nbsp;

Over the time though, I have made extra payments and my last payment was in June 2013, which brought the balance of the loan down to around $5. I looked into paying the loan out however, due to the exorbitant break of loan fees, I decided to let the loan run through to the maturity date of November 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

Over time the loan has been accruing very small amounts of interest and every week there is a Bpay debit from the account so as of now, the loan balance is some $165 with 69 weeks left till maturation of the loan.


&amp;nbsp;

Therefore, it was with some surprise that I received a letter from the lender saying that the account is $256 in arrears. I called up and the bank confirmed that yes, the account is $256 in arrears. When I asked just how the account could be $256 in arrears when the account balance was only $165 to begin with, and with such a long time till the loan matures, I was met with confusion.

&amp;nbsp;

From what I can see, the loan has been in negative arrears since June 2013 when I made my last payment and as the installments have become due, the arrears amount has been slowly eaten away by loan installments. Now, because the loan installments are still 'due' and the arrears amount has been eaten away, they are saying I am 'in arrears' due to not paying an installment?

&amp;nbsp;

The person I spoke to on the phone didn't seem to know what was going on so I thought I'd see if anyone here can shed some light on what I can do?

personalfinance,I have a bunch of old savings bonds and don't know what to do with them. Help?,"My parents recently handed over 19 ee bonds that my grandmother gifted to me through the years. They are each labeled $50 and date from 1991 to 2001. According to the US treasury website, they are all still collecting interest and will continue to for a few more years (up until they turn 30).

I don't mind putting the money away for an extended amount of time to collect interest at a higher rate elsewhere (if such a place exists). I'm not strapped for cash at the moment and already have an emergency fund, albeit a very small one.

However, I also have a good bit of student loans sitting at about a 6% interest rate. I'm guessing it would be best to cash in the bonds and use them to immediately pay off as much of this as I can.

But, like I said, I know nothing about savings bonds and little to nothing about investing money. So, r/personalfinance, what do you suggest I do?

news,A Fair And Balanced Response To Cecil The Lion's Death,"A few thoughts on the killing of Cecil the Lion:
1. It's one of the best examples of media bias we've recently seen. Simply contrast ""Lion is poached outside of Zimbabwe Game Preserve"" with ""Rich American Dentist Murders Beloved Cecil The Lion."" They're doing a stunning job of programming the response with that title. Like, the best ever. 

2. The punishment has to fit the crime you guys. An animal was poached. Nothing more, nothing less. Does the guy really deserve to lose his entire livelihood for it? If he did indeed knowingly poach a lion (we'll likely never know), he should be punished with whatever fees, license revocation, etc. is on the books. We are in agreement with that and I am STRONGLY against poaching. Isn't that what you'd want for yourself if YOU were convicted of a crime? 

3. Cecil is still a LION. The media wants you to believe that Cecil was stolen from a petting zoo in the middle of the night while children where using him as a pillow. He's a lion. When his dominance is threatened he eats lion cubs alive. His favorite thing to do is to tear flesh from zebras while they are still breathing. Please stop picturing him as a fuzzy stuffed animal (I realize many of you are more in touch with nature than that, but many are not.)

4. If you really do feel this strongly about poaching, the your state's DNR publishes a weekly report that lists the names of poachers. This Fall there will be many. You will be very busy smearing the names of these people, as there will be a lot of them. If you do not plan on doing that, why are you so filled with hate toward Dr. Palmer? All human life is equal, and all animal life is equal. You should be just as angry about John Doe who poached a black bear as you are about Cecil the Lion. 

5. If you are as mad as many of the people on Yelp - let me start over, if you even posted on Yelp trying to destroying this man's career and livelihood, please unfriend me. Many people that went over there are literally calling for Dr. Walter Palmer's death. Several said they want his entire family killed. One said that he should put a shotgun in his mouth and that his kids should pull the trigger. If you're over there screaming with that scary ass Lord of the Flies mob I'm not sure that I need to be in relation with you, because you're a scary human being.",technology,1438175997
personalfinance,Personal Loan vs Keeping my Roth and Investment Account,"A year ago my AC went out and unfortunately I didn't have enough in my rainy day fund to cover the amount. I took out a personal loan and still owe about $2800 on it, the interest rate is 10%.

My thinking is that, I should cash out and pay the loan off. The return on the investments has been around 10% but that's mostly due to it being invested in U.S. Equities and there most likely will be a correction by years end. My only hesitation, and maybe you all can shed light and make me feel better, is that I'd only have about $500 in savings (cash savings account) and I'd be really thin.

The program I'm attending doesn't allow students to be employed due to the arduous nature of the classes. As a point of reference, the median pay for the field I will be entering is $90,930 per year (as per the BLS).  

The school estimates the total cost of the program (tuition, fees, room/board, books, personal expenses, bank fees) will be $102,686. I have already accepted a Direct Unsubsidized Stafford loan for $10,141 per term (guaranteed for two terms out of six total) at an interest rate of 5.8%. 

Tuition and fees alone will add up to an estimated total $57,460 over two years (not including books, which will add ~$2,000 per year). 

At this point, I see two options for financing the rest of my expenses: I can take out a Direct Grad PLUS loan for $30,000 per year at an interest rate of 6.8%, or I can clean out my savings accounts for ~$15,000 (leaving ~$10,000 for living expenses) and have to take a PLUS loan for what ever is leftover.

I have been supplementing my limited income with my credit cards since my fiance and I broke up in January. I am now living in a new state, have a decent job, and steady income. I decided that taking this loan was the right step based on the amount of interest paid over time on the loan vs. the credit cards.

personalfinance,(CAN) Living in a tiny house to save money to build something larger. Need to take on some debt in order to get started but will pay it off within the year. Please help me understand with is wrong with this plan.,"I posted over in PFCanada and a few people seemed to think this was a horrible, doomed-to-fail plan.  But nobody really explained *why* it wasn't going to work.  Everything makes sense to my fiance and I, but I'm hoping someone here can help me see what the problem(s) could be.

We have purchased a plot of land that we plan to build on in a few years. In the meantime, we will be living in a 'tiny house' and saving money so that we can hopefully build the house using cash instead of taking out a mortgage. Before we can live in the tiny house, we need to move a Hydro pole that is in the middle of our lot. The cost for this will be around $30K. We have access to my student line of credit (limit of 25K with 8K already spent on tiny house building costs and another 3K needed for my remaining tuition payments - interest is 4.85%) so we plan to use part of that to pay for the move, but will need more to cover the entire cost. Hydro will not do any work until they receive the first half of the payment and the second half is due when the job is complete (approx. 6 weeks later).

Our combined monthly income is just under $7000.

Our monthly expenses will be around $1060.

This leaves us $5940 a month towards paying off debts and saving for a future house. After borrowing the $20K, we will have a total of $45K in debt to pay before saving for the new build. $12.5K is borrowed from family at 0% interest, $12.5K (approx) is my line of credit at 4.85%, the remaining $20K will be borrowed, but I don't know what the interest rate will be.  Conservatively estimating $5000 a month toward this debt, we will have it paid off in 9 months. In reality, it should take even less time as we do not need $940/month for misc. expenses.  Once this debt is paid, it should take us 2-3 years to save enough to build the house.

My fiance owns two homes that we plan to sell in the next few years.  Both are currently rented out.  The first is valued at $180K with $120K remaining on the mortgage.  This house earns enough income to cover all associated costs and repairs (including the mortgage).  We will sell the house if we need additional money for the build.  Otherwise, we may keep it as it is earning income for our future and requires minimal work on our part.  The second is a condo valued at $230K with $225K remaining on the mortgage.  This condo does not earn enough to cover all costs, so it costs us about $100/month in upkeep and fees.  Unfortunately, there are 6 other identical units listed around $230K and not selling (listed 3-4 months each with no offers) so selling isn't really an option right now.  We will sell this unit as soon as possible.

Can you see any issues with our financial plan? We are by no means experts in this field, so if you have any input please let me know!

Was feeling pretty good about the house I am set to close on in 2 weeks until I read other threads here like: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/255fu3/am_i_crazy_to_buy_a_home_at_these_prices/


Here is some background:


Married couple early 30s. Have been living in a studio apartment for the past 6 years . We reside In  a high cost of living area in Northern Virginia - (Arlington / Fairfax). Median SFH price is $617K, Median Condo price is $350K. 


I (husband) have a variable income that runs between $70K and $175K per year – average around $100K most recently. Wife makes $50K. Gross pay last year was $140K for the both of us – should be roughly the same this year. Take home is slightly better than average due to tax strategies.


Debt is minimal. No student loans, large credit cards or car payment.  We have an emergency fund of $25K. We both have Roth IRAs that we contribute to yearly. 


We are under contract on a 1400sf 1952 home in an affordable neighborhood. Sales price is $447.5K. Appraisal came back at $455K. This is a starter home in the area – but could easily be a life long home for us. It’s very close to both of our in-laws who are well off and can provide child care and a  financial back stop. We love this house and want to own a home. I am handy and can handle most repairs and welcome the challenge. House is turn key and requires nothing immediately.


We are putting down about 7% to bring it to a conforming loan of $417K @ 4.375%. We are avoiding BPMI by paying a slightly higher interest rate.  The P&amp;I will be $2082 a month, Taxes $400, Insurance $70. TotaI monthly cost of $2600. Estimated utilities are $350. So lets say $3K a month all in for fixed housing expenses. 


One other thing – the house has a day light finished basement that can be rented for ~$1K a month. We plan on doing this for the first 24-36 months – which would bring our monthly expenses down by a third.  My math below does not include this. 

In a down year our gross pay will be about $110K a year – or $6700 a month take home. This year it will be $8269. In a good year it would be closer to $10K a month.  In a down year I am close to 50% of my take home going to housing and utilities. This diminishes to 35% this year, closer to 30% in a good year. Our income should rise over time. 


According to the 50/20/30 rule I am ok so long as I don’t take on additional monthly debt. We will adhere to a strict budget to maintain this ratio at a projected income of $110K – with any surplus going into additional savings / lump sum against principal. 


Am I an idiot for considering this? Outside of moving out of the area I don’t see our prospects of home ownership becoming more affordable. Plus we have a tremendous support network of family and friends close by.

I’m ineligible for the US federal student loans because the university isn’t one of the international universities covered and I’m ineligible for the Dutch student loans because I’m not from the European Economic Area. Furthermore, I’ve contacted a number of private loan providers (Sallie Mae, Wells Fargo, Discover, and many smaller ones) and they don’t have a financial relationship with the university so I’m ineligible for loans there.

As far as the money, I currently have $20,000 in US federal student debt from my bachelor's and am looking at about €30,000 total between tuition (€14,000), cost of living (€12,000), and transportation/miscellaneous expense (€4,000). I am planning to do a 2nd master’s in Social Economics after completing the degree in Econometrics. As such, costs would increase to €61,000 (including €1,000 for an annual tuition increase).

I was hoping to work to cover that, however, I recently discovered that students from outside the EEA are only allowed to work 10 hours/week and must wait 6 months before becoming eligible for work and so that isn’t a feasible option.

personalfinance,Clearing debt and start saving,"Hello. I'm not from the USA (from Singapore), but I hope I still can post here.

I recently have had a confirmed job and I'm really liking it - now it's time to start to think about clearing my debts. I made stupid mistakes in the past and have about 7,000 debt. 4k is interest-free, while the remaining 3k is 26% P.A credit line. I am hoping to clear at least the 3k within the next 6-8 months, and hopefully entirely by the end of next year or at least early 2017. This is assuming nothing changes and I keep my job and salary at the current rate.

I currently draw 1900 per month, with 20% going into a pension fund (CPF) which can be used for housing in the future (like, at least 8 years in the future). So effectively I have 1500 left a month. I pay about 200-250 every month for bills and public transport, excluding repayments for the 3k.

My priority should be clearing the 3k debt, but I literally have zero savings at the moment. Is it possible to continue paying the debt (I plan on paying back 300/month), while still saving a bit in case something bad happens, or should I be channeling all that I can into paying the debt which means I pay less overall?

It has also been suggested to me that I take a *second* loan with a lower interest rate (10-15%). While I can find some, I'm not sure if they are willing to extend credit given my history, and since I've been burnt so badly by this I am wary of having another loan. 

Sorry if I'm not too clear, and will answer any questions asked. Basically my main questions are:

1. Will it be better to pay as much as I can for the 3k, or save a little bit every month to slowly build up savings so that I have a fallback/ emergency fund.
2. Will it be prudent to take a 2nd loan at a lower interest rate to clear the 26% rate debt assuming I can get approval?
3. Is my timeline for repayment of all the loans realistic?

2) Start a Roth IRA and max out $5.5k for the year, and spend the remaining $1.5k in repaying my high interest student loans. For my IRA, I plan to actively manage my portfolio, since I am already experienced in trading through an individual portfolio account. 

My conflict I have is to let my $5.5k compound with interest and let my assets grow early on, or to get a head start in getting rid of my liabilities. Which one do you think will be beneficial in the future? 

tl;dr pay off student loans with savings early, or start a roth IRA.",finance,1438199222

We currently pay 700 in rent for the house and are considering assuming the mortgage form my parents (as long as their is no prepayment fee, but the company already said the morgtate can be assumed by us pending income and credit requirements and my parents gifting us the equity).

I am considering putting basically all of my checks towards the house and try to pay it which would be about $2600 a month and try to pay it off in 3-4 yrs. Is that crazy?

Also, one justification I have for doing this is my husband always says things about me just staying at home and not working (sometimes he says it jokingly and sometimes he acts like he's being serious, totally ridiculous and not going to happen) and I just think what's the different in not working or putting all my money towards the house? 

I am very nervous when it comes to fiances and I just think having a home paid off would be a huge relief and kind of a safety net not having to worry about that monthly expense and having it as an asset. 

Please tell me if you think this is crazy and if you think it would be better to pay less and aim to pay it off in 5 or 10 years or what your opinion is please. 

I know some people place more of focus on retirement and investing but I feel like having a home paid off is higher on my list of priorities and we would still have plenty of time and money freed up to focus on that afterward.

personalfinance,Help lowering car payment (if possible),"Here's a quick summary of my situation:

* Leased a 2011 Scion TC for 3 years (MSRP ~$21k) - paid **$331 a month with 1.9% interest rate**; promotional APR was going on
* Traded it back in sometime in March 2014 for a new leased Scion FR-S (MSRP ~$27k) - paid **$434 a month with same interest rate**; this time it was because I was a recent college grad so it bumped me to Tier 1
* Decided to move to upstate NY 3 months later after putting 10k miles on the car due to multiple trips back in forth from MA &gt; upstate NY for job interviews and apartment hunting
* Traded FR-S in at local dealer who valued it at ~$18k
* Financed a new 2014 TC Monogram series (MSRP ~$23k) - paying **$625 a month with 4.1% interest rate** due to credit and because I had ~$8k in negative equity as a penalty carried over from the FR-S
* **Total loan for this new TC is ~$33k now**

Now the reason I traded the FR-S back in was because it was a low clearance car, RWD, and wasn't really suited for the area here in Rochester. It was all stupid decisions to buy directly from the dealer, I know that. I should have been buying used from the beginning.

I'm getting by month to month with my new job ($23/hr, take home will be close to $3500 a month) and expenses will be leveling out once I get back in the swing of things here.

personalfinance,I'm guessing I'm not the only one stuck in this home buying rat race. Helpful advice is appreciated.,"My wife and I are in a quandary and I'm turning to /r/personalfinance for your thoughts.  I've been a 4 year subscriber to this subreddit and the advice here has really helped get my financial house in order but I'm using a throwaway because I'm revealing a lot.

We are currently renting but want to buy a house.  Our budget is $130,000 to $175,000 for a starter home.  Our real goal is to keep our monthly payment below $1,100/month with taxes, insurance, and possible PMI included. 

We gross $100,000 per year and net about $5,000 per month, or $60,000 per year.  Below is a breakdown of expenses:

* Student Loans: $1,700/m - $20,400 annual
* Rent, Utilities, Insurance, Groceries - $1,600/m - $19,200 annual
* 401(k), Roths, Savings, Emergency - $750/m - $9,000 annual
* Home Down Payment - $1,000/m - $12,000 Annual (Current Balance: $14,000)
* No loans, no car payments, no credit card debt
* We both have pristine credit reports and credit scores of 725+

Here's where our issue lies.  We don't have the 20% down payment like we want but we also know interest rates are going to increase once, possibly twice in the next 3-6 months.  30 year fixed rates are around 4.15% in my area. I believe - and this is an assumption - it's not unrealistic to expect those 30 year rates to rise to 4.50-4.75% in the next year. 

$150,000 over 30 years at 4.15% with ($120 PMI, $150 taxes, $67 Ins) - ~$1,068/m

$150,000 over 30 years at 4.50% with ($120 PMI, etc) - ~$1,099/m
* No PMI, $977/m (Save $1,464/year)

$150,000 over 30 years at 4.75% with ($120 PMI, etc) - ~$1,122/m
* No PMI, $999/m 

$150,000 over 30 years at 5.00% with ($120 PMI, etc) - ~$1,144/m
* No PMI, $1,022/m

What's keeping me up at night is do we bite the bullet and pay the PMI or wait until we have 20% down and risk our monthly payment going up? Your questions, advice, help, and insight are genuinely appreciated.",finance,1438203758

The general misunderstanding is that this is due to [quantitative easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing), but quantitative easing is only the substitution of short term credit for long.

It's true that central banks, [like the Fed](https://twitter.com/ChicagoSchooler/status/616485557221199872), have done this, but the expansion of total reserve credit is due to the level of interest rates.

Ironically, this phenomenon called [Liquidity Preference Theory](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquiditypreference.asp) was posited by Keynes, an economist who more or less dismissed the value of money &amp; inflation's impact on recession though he didn't mean for it to explain the relative quantities of money, and it can be seen in [historical US data](https://twitter.com/IdealReserve/status/597973831735746560).

Almost no cryptocurrency has any interest rates, and none has properly priced or short term interest rates.  This would present a problem for valuation if it weren't for the greatest monetary economist of the first half of the twentieth century [Irving Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Fisher).

He is the reason why we have a reliable price index, eponymously named the [Fisher Ideal Index](http://mba-lectures.com/statistics/descriptive-statistics/561/fisher-ideal-price-index.html) which he constructed after being [nearly the sole creator of price index tests](https://archive.org/details/makingofindexnum00fishrich).

He also developed the theory of the [Fisher Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_hypothesis) which states that the nominal interest rate is the sum of the real interest rate and the inflation rate.  [This also can be observed from history.](https://twitter.com/IdealReserve/status/597973007563390976)

By combining the Fisher Effect with Liquidity Preference statistics, a basis valuation for any currency, or more importantly cryptocurrency, can be determined.

First, a cryptocurrency's inflation rate has to be determined.  This can be done by taking the rate of change of the inverted annualized quotient and subtracting the inflation rate of a population.  For example, in bitcoin's case, the inverted annualized quotient is last year's price divided by this year's price, so in USD's case, that is about $580 divided by $288, a 100% increase.  The last known inflation rate for the US is about 0%, so bitcoin's inflation rate for the US is 100%.

Since nominal interest rates are usually a few percentage points above the inflation rate, bitcoin's implied short term interest rate is approximately 102% or less.

There's not much data for interest rates this high, so it can be assumed that bitcoin's maximum liquidity preference is 4% of its' users' GDP.

Here is where the uncertainty of a valuation increases since it's not easy to determine what the average income of the users or even the total quantity of users is.

[Assuming that there are 1.5 million bitcoin users](https://bitscan.com/bitnews/item/how-many-people-really-own-bitcoins-and-why-does-it-matter) and that the vast majority are in the US and Europe, their GDP could be estimated to be $69 billion.  Multiplying by the above liquidity preference rate, bitcoin could be valued at $2.76 billion, not too far from its present market capitalization.",cryptocurrency,1438215725
personalfinance,To refinance or not to refinance.,"I bought a house ~18 months ago.  I purchased a shortsale that had two banks and a debt collection agency involved.  Purchase price was 212,000, borrowed $199,500.  I obviously have PMI ($99.75/month)  and and my interest rate is 4.625%.    It was appraised at time of purchase at ~$235,000.

I've since got the interior and exterior painted, some siding repaired, and some landscaping in the back yard. (planted rose bushes, seeded grass)  The paint was badly needed at the time of purchase and the back yard had never been landscaped, it was a mess of rock, weed and 10 year old wood chips. (used as 'landscaping' by the builder)

Currently Zillow and Trulia value the property at 239,000 and 241,000.  I owe ~$194,500.

My credit union offers a product for a refinance, 0 fees, 4.5% interest rate and they will reimburse the cost of the the appraisal.  the main incentive would be the opportunity to drop the PMI, the minor interest rate adjustment would be just gravy.  I could go lower on the interest rate, but that would involve fees- we are not sure if this is a forever home or just a home for the next several years quite yet.  

Will the improvements I've made so far affect the appraised value at all?  Prices in this area have generally been trending up. If it does appraise at the same value when i bought it, I figure I'd have to plow in another $7000 into the house in order to get 20% equity.

My plan with the freed up cash would be  to actually keep my monthly payments the same but accelerate payments to principal.

Is there anyway to determine if this is worth doing?  (FWIW I am on schedule to hit federal caps for 401k for myself and  IRAs for self and wife, and we make small contributions to a college savings fund as we live in  a state where that nets us a state income tax deduction)

personalfinance,"Being denied Pell grants/loans, need some good advice","I was recently told that I have exceeded my financial aid maximum credit limit for the Pell grants I was receiving. I'm a little bit nervous about what I'm going to do and I could really use some advice. 

Here's some more details of my current situation: 
___________________________________
I'm not sure which information is useful so forgive me if I type too much and please tell me if I need to include anything else. Anyway, here goes. 

I only have 6 more classes I need to take at my community college in order to obtain my associates degree in Java programming in the state of Michigan. After which I planned on transferring to a larger (and more expensive) university which has a transfer agreement with my school to turn my associates degree into a bachelors degree in computer science once I complete the program. 

I have already talked to a counselor about a max credit appeal but unfortunately I was denied it. The reason they said I was denied was because financial aid requires you to complete your degree within 150% of the credit hours required. My current associates degree program consists of 62 credit hours and I was suppose to finish the program within 93 attempted credit hours. I have used 119 of the 93 maximum credit hours allowed for this program. The reason for taking so many classes at my school was I originally went for a certificate program in sound engineering which I finished successfully. After that I took a couple of semesters pursuing a degree in graphic design until I came to my senses and went for the programming/comp.sci. degree.

Because I make so little money I was able to pay for my entire tuition at my school using the Pell grant money I was provided. Now I don't really know what I'm going to do. I haven't had to take out any subsidized/unsubsidized loans but I would definitely be willing to if it came to that. The problem with that is that they won't even let me take out any federal loans because I hit my max credit limit. I had always assumed I would end up taking out loans if my Pell grants became exhausted but I had no idea they would block me from taking out loans.

My grant status on nslds.ed.gov says my Pell lifetime eligibility used is 512.606% (I've read the lifetime limit is 600%, or 12 semesters). The site also says that my total dispersed amount equals $23,232 by the way.

Anyway, here's my questions for everyone. First, will this max credit ineligibility status I currently have be carried over to the university I transfer to, or does it sort of start over/get readjusted for different universities once I transfer? Also, if I absolutely need to start borrowing federal loans how am I suppose to do that if they say I can't because of my current max credit limit? I'm really confused what to do right and could really use some advice. 

TLDR: Hit my Pell grant max credit limit (and possibly Pell lifetime eligibility limit) and am being denied federal loans to finish associates degree @ community college which I planned on using to transfer to university to complete a bachelors in computer science.",finance,1438217241

personalfinance,PF Perspective on Job Move - Better Opportunities for Less Money,"Hi PF!

I have been offered a job which opens up more opportunities for career advancement but which is for less money than I make now and I wanted PF's perspective on it. 

The details:
I am in my mid-20s with an advanced degree and about 200k in student loan debt. I qualify for student loan forgiveness in 9 years as well as a (small) pension when I turn 65 if I stay within my government's job circuit. Given that debt load, I want to stay in my government's job circuit for the next 9 years as the average interest on my loans is ~7%. So here's where my question comes in - 

My government job circuit consists, basically, of three levels - 
#1 - What I do now. Pay ranges from 55k - 75k. I have a year experience at this level.
#2 - A greater range of transferable skills. Pay ranges from 45k - 55k
#3 - The best job in my circuit. Pay ranges from 60k - 90k. I did a fairly significant internship at this level.

My career goal is to make it to #3 within 9 years then jump to a federal job (where the pay can be more than double).

I currently make 57k and am on track for making ~$62k next year this time in my #1 job slot. That increase will be graduated over the course of the year. 

I have just been offered a job for 53k at the #2 job slot. That job also comes with some added expenses - travel time will increase significantly (gas per work week estimated at 30 - 35 gallons instead of 10) + I will have to get a second car for my wife. That job will also give me about half the amount of leave time as my current position. However, that job will open up the job market significantly, making me much more marketable for a #3 job slot (or a federal job slot). Quite honestly, the extra skills in the #2 job slot are the only skills missing from my resume for the #3 job slot. That said, the #3 job slot only comes up once, maybe twice, per year and there is a fair bit of competition. I do know, however, that if I take the #2 job, I can expect to be a very strong competitor for the #3 slot in about 2 years and will probably get it within 5.

Based upon the pay scales, I can expect to earn/keep ~100k more over the next 5 years than if I move to the #2 slot. After that, however, there is a good chance that I will move to the #3 slot and be on par. After 9 years, I would have a much, much better shot at a federal job in the #3 slot than the #1 slot, and there I could potentially make quite a few hundred thousand more than if I get stuck in the state system.

My question is, should I take the #2 job even though I'm looking at a significant and immediate loss of income?",finance,1438220078

investing,Margin Investing: When is it Worth It? (with specific example),"Hi guys, I was hoping someone could make sure I'm not way out in left field with my thinking on Margin Investing. I wanted to see when margin investing would beat the alternative of simple buy-and-hold and the math told me:

Leverage Ratio &gt; I / (G - I)

where G = total gains on the security
    and I = loan interest rate

So if I took out a 4.25% margin loan to buy a garden-variety S&amp;P 500 index returning a total of 6% annually, I'd need to be levered **1:2.5** before it starts being the better option? Not to mention, assuming a worst-case 1-day drop of 2.6%, that means the margin strategy would force me to keep an additional 6.5% of my own initial investment set aside as a cushion.

This seems like a crappy strategy. Have I missed anything glaringly obvious? Thanks!",finance,1438225470

After we received the card, I called the credit card issuer to transfer two of our balances over from two separate credit card companies. During my second balance transfer the representative on the phone informed me that there was a 13.99% interest rate on balance transfers.  I told him that when we signed up for the card that we signed up because there were no APR on balance transfers. But instead what we got was no APR on purchases.  Now, instead of cancelling the card is there is a way to purchase my balance off the other cards?

personalfinance,Found out my SO didn't file Federal or State taxes from 2005 till 2013. What do we do now?,"TL;DR at the bottom

I met my SO 3 years ago, late November of 2012. When it came time to file taxes in 2013 (for 2012) we were not living together yet and so I didn't ask him about taxes. In 2014 we were living together and when it came for tax time (filing for 2013) I saw he received his W2 from his employer in the mail so I asked him if he wanted me to do his taxes for him. He said sure, why not. I filed his 2013 taxes and he was due for a Federal refund and didn't owe any taxes to the state. He gets a letter several weeks later from the IRS saying his Federal refund was seized and sent to a collection agency for non payment of a bill he owed. 

To add some background: My SO went through hurricane Katrina in 2005. He lost everything. His house split in half from category 5 hurricane force winds and what was left floated away in the flood aftermath. When he was finally allowed to come back in to the neighborhood to assess the damage, everything that wasn't nailed down had been looted. He lived in a tent for 6 months before he was granted a FEMA trailer. On top of all that, he lost his job. The business he was working for also sustained damage in the hurricane and folded up shop and went out of business. To make matters worse, he fell ill in late 2006 due to stress and a bad kidney infection. In 2007 he filed bankruptcy because of all the doctor bills and he had no health insurance at the time. 

So, when his 2013 Federal tax refund was seized, he said it was probably due to the bankruptcy. I didn't think much of it after that and chalked it up to a late creditor. Now here we are in 2015 and I prepare his taxes for 2014. Federal says he gets a refund again, State he breaks even. We figure 2014 will be like 2013 and some creditor will seize the money again. But no, the IRS actually sends him a check!

As we discuss what we are going to do with the whopping $312 he was refunded he tells me ""I'm surprised they sent that since I haven't filed my taxes since 2005."" I asked him to repeat himself and he said it again. His reasoning is that after hurricane Katrina his life was a mess and he forgot about filing taxes for 2005 because he was just trying to survive. Literally, he was living in a tent day and night till about mid 2006, no job, and getting sicker by the day. He figured once he missed the deadline for filing in 2006 that the IRS would send him something and he never received anything in the mail. Then when 2007 came around he had just filed for bankruptcy and, since he didn't work the previous year he didn't see the sense in filing any tax forms. After that he just didn't file any more. 

What do we do now? He wants to go ahead and come clean and get this all straightened out. We want to get married but I told him I would rather get this resolved first. He agrees and doesn't want to put this off any longer. He's fully prepared to own up to whatever he owes but we don't know where to start to get that information.


I am assuming we shouldn't go this alone with the IRS and should seek professional help. 

Do we hire a CPA or a tax attorney? (Is there a difference? I don't even know if they are the same profession or what?)

We are looking to move since we will quickly run out of space in our current house, but are not sure if it's wise to put a rather sizeable down payment to reduce our mortgage payment or put down just enough to avoid PMI and invest the rest. 

Our monthly income is enough to cover the mortgage payment without any issue, but it would essentially stop our retirement savings. I'm thinking this won't be an issue since we will be able to easily max out our Roth every year by pulling from the estate and investing the rest.

I'm also a little worried about risk exposure, but I think even with conservative investing, we could beat the interest rate we will be paying on the mortgage.

personalfinance,Good Student with Bad Credit: Struggling to find a means to attend school this fall. What are my options?,"Hi all. Here's my rundown: I'm planning on entering my fifth year of my undergrad program at the end of August. It's taken me this long to graduate because I have two majors that both require attention: math and physics. I'm one of the only people with this double major at this university, and doing pretty damn well. Right now I have a 3.51 GPA. This summer I started doing research in computational quantum chemistry. As my education blooms, I feel as though my prospect garden is being well-sowed.

However, one thing that has not been growing is my wallet unfortunately. My mom and I kind of messed up on our taxes this year and had to mail in an amendment for them. So since our taxes are held up, my federal financial aid is being held up. I am having to turn to different paths to try and get money for this upcoming semester. As of now, I have 12 days to pay $4200 (or make a payment of $2000, minimum) of tuition. I will need to pay around the same amount in January. I do have a job, but it barely is enough to pay the rent, much less pay that tuition. So far in my education I've been pretty lucky when it comes to loans. I have had to take out 2 for summer classes in years past, adding up to &lt;$5000. I've had scholarships for the past 4 years that ran out this year because most academic scholarships only last for 4 years.

I have already tried applying for some private loans through Suntrust and Sallie Mae. My credit is not good enough to apply for a loan by myself. I've been looking at my options for cosigners...last night my mom tried to apply as my cosigner and was rejected (her credit is bad), and I have reached out to extended family only to receive tepid responses. (It's just me, my mother, and younger brother in our family--my dad passed away a few years ago.) Right now I'm continuing to look for a new cosigner in my family that will work on a loan with me.

But, Reddit--do I have any more options? I feel as this loan is my best bet right now, but I am constantly looking and stressing out about other ways to get a means to attend.",finance,1438261383

personalfinance,Student Loan &amp; Financial Aid Help,"I am currently a college drop out (not by choice), and need some advice for possible options I have for returning to school. Here's some background information:

* I graduated high school in 2013, after being accepted to Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). During part of my high school years I was considered homeless from around 2011-2014. My mother got laid off which forced us to live in a motel for those years. Fortunately enough for me, I was lucky enough to stay with a friend to finish out my remaining high school years and graduate with a 3.4 (which I think is pretty good considering the circumstances)
* I filed for a FASFA because there was 0 chance in getting any financial help from my parents. I wasn't awarded any scholarships and had no savings. Through the FASFA I was awarded roughly ~$10,000 for the year. My classes were roughly ~$7,000 per semester. I lived on campus in their freshman dorm for the first semester.
* Turns out my FASFA was selected for verification. (still not 100% sure what that even means) So I went to Student Accounting to find out what I had to do in order for the FASFA money to be processed and go through. I filed as a dependent because at the time I had no source of income. The Financial Aid office required a few documents that I needed to get filled out / turn in, such as Parents W-2's / 2012-2013 Federal Tax Transcript. 
* I called my parents and asked them to get me these documents, but apparently they've had problems with their taxes in the past few years which made getting their 2012-2013 Federal Tax Transcript an issue. 
* Without the FASFA money processed to my account, I had a hold placed onto my account until that document was returned. I couldn't apply for a loan because I was required to have a cosigner and everyone that I asked either could not help or didn't have strong enough credit.
* I reached out to the President of Student Affairs, the president of my department, my student academic adviser, and many others and they've all told me there is nothing they can do without the form turned in. I had a ""1 time student accreditation"" for roughly ~$5,000 applied to my account, but that still didn't cover the Fall 2013 balance, thus still having my account on hold and being unable to apply for Spring 2014 classes until the amount was fully paid.
* I have an older sister who also attends Norfolk State University, and her FASFA was also selected for verification, we have the same information, and her university asked for the same documents. But when she explained to them about being unable to get a Federal Tax Transcript they offered her some type of waiver form that could be accepted in it's place. Hearing about her recent success I also attempted to do the same at my university but did not get those same results.

**TLDR;** 20 yr old college drop out at VCU cannot register for classes until 1st semester is fully paid off. FASFA did not get credited to his student account due to being selected for Verification. Has applied for many scholarships with no success. Cannot receive a student loan without a cosigner (has no willing / able person). Only attended 1 full semester Fall 2013.

Currently my situations have changed a bit. Since July of 2014 my mother and I are no longer homeless, we are both currently working, living in a 2bd apartment, but there is still hardly any leftover money that I can spare to put towards my bill. Last year I filed another FASFA for Fall 2014 - Spring 2015 and was yet again selected for verification. According to Financial Aid office the FASFA I filed for Fall 2013 - Spring 2014 is no longer available to be accessed, so even if they received the Federal Tax Transcript form for that year the money could not be put towards my account, meaning it would take money from my most recent FASFA filing (Fall 2015 - Spring 2016) to cover the remaining bill.

My school costs roughly ~$26,000/year. If I can get my Financial Aid it will be roughly ~$15,000/year. (~$60-$70/4 years) I cannot rely on my parents for any help in this situation at all.  I can't file as an independent because i'm technically dependent. What options do I have? All help is appreciated.",finance,1438267280

**The coles-notes of it (specific details will be posted below)**

Me:  I'm horrible with money. I came out of school with a moderate student loan (40k). I've made almost every poor decision possible since graduation. I now have personal debt of about $80,000 and I only make $60,000 a year. I don't own a house. I own a car I'm making payments on. I don't have any savings. I'm married and she...

Wife: Great with money, although a little eccentric about it. Just finished veterinarian school, so now has student debt of $114,000. Her personal debt totals about $120,000 and she makes $75,000 a year (as a first year vet). She owns a car that is paid off.

Expenditures (minimum payments on all + all living costs: $5,386.00

**My Plan**

After researching various ways to pay off debt, I think I've decided on the ""Snowball"" method. We're going to take a large chunk (~$1200) of that ""remaining"" money, and put it on the smallest remaining credit card debt. Once the credit card debts are all paid off (~$24,000), we will re-evaluate.

**Issues**

My wife wants to have a kid.... and soon. I can't justify it, especially when our finances are in such turmoil. Going down to 1 income for an entire year would break us. She just doesn't get it. She also wants a new car because hers is on the way out (it's an '08). I'm stressed to the max about money all day, every day. I feel like I've put a decent plan in place, but I can't get her buy-in because of the things she wants (and deserves, in reality).

**What I need**

Any insight, thoughts, opinions or suggestions anyone can make. If you see something I should change, tweak, adjust or anything.... I'm willing to listen to it all. If you just want to shoot me some encouraging words, that's also welcome. You can even chirp me about getting myself into this position, it's definitely warranted.

Okay, so my husband and I have a take-home income of $4200/mo.  Over the past few years, we've been able to save an emergency fund of $25K.  We took the money we earmarked for the emergency fund and now have a small down payment saved for a house ($20K).  We want to buy a home within a year.

We know that houses require maintenance, so we were thinking about how to manage saving for those expenses.  Do we just consider our emergency fund part of that and then pay back into the emergency fund when we dip in?  Or is it better to have a second fund only for home maintenance?  We also don't want to just leave our money sitting around unnecessarily (savings account interest rates are poop, as you know).  Also, if we SHOULD be setting aside a home maintenance fund, how much a month do you recommend? 

Thank you! :)

EDIT: I should say that we have $4000 in outstanding debt on a car.  We have the money to pay it off in full (obviously) but financed it at 0% APR so we're using it to bolster our credit. :)  Other than that, we have no other debt (credit card, student loans, etc.)",finance,1438274277
personalfinance,Question - Large CC debt,"So due to some unfortunate events in the past I have racked up some pretty massive CC debt which in turn is crushing my credit score.

I have:   
Bofa CC with 20000/23000K 13.99% - Two 30 day missed payments, 4/14 and 6/14  
Citi CC with 6200/8300 16.99% - One 30 day missed payment 11/13  
Chase Slate CC with 3000/3200 0% until 7/2016  
Discover CC with 0/1800  
Navient Private 4900 6.75%  
Navient Federal 2000 2.32% - This consists of two small loans both have one 90 day missed payment in 1/14. I had no idea this was even due because it was in forbearance at the time :(  

Recently authorized user on several cards:  
Amex 0/9000  
Barclays 0/10000  
Chase 0/3000  
Citi 0/10500  

So currently I am paying $500 to bofa, $375 to citi, $100 to slate (will increase this later on to make sure it is paid by the apr promo date), $150 to navient private and $100 to navient federal  

My credit score is around 640 not really sure if I should try to get a lending club (seems like lowest rates) loan and consolidate.  

You guys are the experts, please give me some insight :)  

Side note - have heard about calling into cc companies or even navient to ask for a goodwill removal of late payment but have no idea how this works or what group to call. Usually you would hear ""we have to report accurately to the CRB's...""

edit: discover just used the credit line increase with no hard pull and they increased $500 to 2300. Also an offer for 0% 12 months for 3% fee. Anything worth paying? A Navient loan?

I want to still pay here and there while I can, even while it's in deferment, because I know about the interest accruing and want to make a dent in it, since I'll be accruing more for grad school.

On the Great Lakes website, it says ""During your deferment, the federal government will pay the interest that accrues on your subsidized balance. Interest on the rest of your balance continues to accrue daily. You can pay the interest while you are in deferment, or wait until your accounts enter repayment.""

Am I allowed to keep paying my monthly payment to them, even though it's in deferment? Will that take them out of deferment? Is it better to not pay them while they'e deferred?

The annual fees for maintaining the account are $120.  They guarantee a minimum interest rate of 4% on the value of the account. Presently it's worth just shy of $2k.  Apparently during my early 20's the payments lapsed, and they just pulled the annual fee out of the account balance.

The insurance payout only worth $25k, and only if I experience an accidental death.  It's pretty crummy insurance, honestly, but I'm wondering if it can be a worthwhile long term investment vehicle, or not.  Once I hit the $3k mark, the annual interest then exceeds the annual fee, so if I had to lapse on a payment the overall value would still continually grow, albeit at a glacial rate.

The only two downsides I see are:
1. I will need to keep full coverage on it, and
2. If I need to get rid of this car for some reason, I'll need to pay the loan in full at that time.

QUESTIONS

1.What should I do in this situation? Contribute to my Employer's ROTH 457 or Vanguard's ROTH IRA. I figured since I'm 90/10 stocks to bonds, I should go with the cheaper Equity fund offered by my employer (er .05%), then whatever is left over, fund to vanguard VTTSX Target fund at Vanguard (er .18%). or just abolish The vanguard IRA altogether (see question 2). BTW, I currently contribute 15% to my 457b (deferred plan), with the account set to increase in 5% increments every year until it hits 30%.

2. In the next year or so, I plan on joining the Military reserves and starting the TSP plan. Would the vanguard ROTH IRA be overkill?

I am a teacher, bringing in about 50-51K per year starting out. I live in NYC.

Budget:
Rent 1100

Train 116

Cell Phone 100

Electric 75

Wifi 20

Loans 500

Food--Depends

So in the 6 months should I pay off the smaller or larger OR interest (About 3K).

Also should I consider Loan consolidation?
I know my budget is going to be very very tight.
Also worthy to note I might be leigible for forgiveness after 10 years because I am a teacher.

Another question, maybe I should just pick the lowest possible repayment plan, it will be very low, but in the long term a lot more, but will i even be doing  a dent with my income and this amount of accruing interest, eager to hear peoples opinions, thanks!",finance,1438305692
personalfinance,"Canadian/American dual citizen, working permanetely in Canada but paying off an American student loan. The exchange rate is killing me! What should I do?","Hey guys, need your advice here. As the title says, I'm a Canadian/American dual citizen living in Canada. I was born and raised in Massachusetts, and after high school, I started University in Rhode Island. I had to get a private loan for this, and my uncle had to cosign for it (my parents had just finished filing for bankruptcy, so they couldn't cosign).

I dropped out after two months because they threat of nearly $100 in student debt upon graduation scared me shit less.  I was already a dual citizen, and my immediate family moved a few months before I did.

In Canada, I was able to get a government loan for schooling. Unfortunately I had to drop out my last year...but fortunately this is Canada, and I'm on the Repayment Assistance Plan for my Canadian debt. This means the Canadian government is paying off my interest each month, with no impact on my credit.

That just leaves my American student loan. I have never missed a payment, as I don't want to affect my uncle's credit. My current balance is $22,881.97, with a 4.68% interest rate. Minimum payment per month is $160 USD. With the exchange rate at 1.30 CAD to 1.00 USD, I have to pay around $208. This feels like throwing money away, as the exchange rate was around 1.05 CAD to 1 USD up until about a year ago, when the gas prices crashed.  Gas prices are going down again and I'm afraid the exchange rate will get worse as a result.

So it seems like I have three options:

1. Try to obtain a personal loan now from a canadian bank and  transfer the balance. This would lock in the exchange rate, in a way, and it would remove my uncle's credit as a liability. But if the exchange rate goes back down, I will be at a loss.

2. Make minimum payments until the exchange rate is closer to parity, then obtain a personal loan. This would protect me from any increases in exchange rate. But there is no guarantee the exchange rate will go down.

3. Keep the loan in the US and make as big a payment as I can, exchange rate be damned.

I know the general rule of them is to pay off the largest interest debts first, but I don't know how/if that advice applies when there's a variable exchange rate. I am just now getting to the point where I can afford to make more than the monthly minimum...I want to know the best way of using that money.

personalfinance,Have finally gotten my financial feet under me - looking for advice to build a better long term plan,"Hello all! I've been lurking for a little over a year now, and have worked a lot of the advice you've all shared into my daily financial life. I paid off a four-year car loan in just under two years, I'm halfway to having a six-month emergency fund secured, and no longer worry about being able to pay rent each month (YAY!). I've reached a good point to reassess and start working on longer term goals, but I'm not sure how to divvy them up. I've read the FAQs a few times, but if anyone spots some part of it they think I should take closer note of, please let me know! And now, apologies for a wall of text.


I have three types of student loans (split into smaller individual loans at different rates within those three types), and altogether they add up to $67,673 currently. I'm happy to share the detailed breakdown, but they're basically: about 26k in a very low-rate private loan (half 4.28% and half 2.78%), 17.5K in an average private loan at 6.24%, and my federal loans total about 24k and their rates range from 4.25-6.55% (but the majority are in 6.55%). The federal loans are slated to be paid off in July of 2021, the private loans are closer to 11 and 12 years from now (I think?). I pay a total of about $750 a month towards all three (240 towards low-rate private, 230 towards normal private, and 277 towards fed) and while I'm making a dent, I'd like to make a bigger one. 


I have no retirement plan and at 27, that's starting to really make me nervous. My company doesn't offer any plan or matching, although now that I've been there full-time for over a year, I'm eligible for and participating in their 'profit sharing plan', for which I've been able to get almost no info. Basically all of the employees earn a percentage of our company's yearly profit, to be paid when we retire or leave the company. I have no way of knowing how much money this is, but I've frankly put it out of my mind as it's not something I can predict or budget for (or even really rely on, so I'm not).  


Starting next month, I'll be putting $500 a month (up from $300) into savings towards my emergency fund. The goal is 12k (about 6 months of expenses), and I currently have $5326 (plus 2k of 'cushion' money in my checking account, which I consider part of that emergency fund). There is also an extra $500 I just put into savings that I expect to need for a car maintenance expense sometime this year, but I've not listed it nor counted it towards my goal. I estimate that I'll reach the full 12k by next April.  


Unmarried, living with 5+ year boyfriend, no kids. Here's a monthly breakdown (although I have two extra paychecks a year due to the biweekly cycle - shown below is a normal month) (one of the two bonus checks goes to pay my car insurance, so it's a wash anyway)  


Monthly take home after tax: ~2760  
Auto deposit to kitty emergency fund: 60 (we're up to $840!)  
Auto deposit to savings: 500  
Rent: 775  
Student loans: 750  
Groceries: 200  
Other spending: ~200 (meals out, movies, socks, deodorant...)  
Public transit pass: 75  
Electric: 20-40ish  
Wireless: 26  
Gas: 20-40  
Hulu/Netflix: 15    


My budget has wiggle room because I have a few secondary incomes. I work part-time seasonally as a waitress, which brings in about an extra 2k a year, and I sell antiques in an Etsy shop, with the profits (after expenses) ranging from 50-500 a month - but most often at the lower end of that range (and during slow seasons like summer, next to nothing). This usually pays for things like Christmas gifts, the very rare weekend trip, bar tabs, etc. Those secondary incomes paid for an emergency move when we got kicked out of our old apartment, thankfully not eating up all of my savings. I try not to rely on them because they're not steady.  


I realize that getting more aggressive with my loans should wait until I have that 6 month emergency fund secure, so although it's frustrating I know I can't make big changes until April. But come April, I'll have an extra $200 a month to put towards something (if I reduce my saving back down to the $300 a month I'd been allotting up until now). Should I throw it at my most expensive, highest rate loan? Open a 401k or IRA? 

**TLDR** ***I'd love to find a way to get these student loans paid off in 5-10 years, and to start to save for retirement and maybe even a house within the next 10 years. Is it possible to save for a house or wedding when I have such pressing student loans?***

When I was young, I got into some financial situations, like most young people, and swore to never be in that situation again.  I straightened up, and was strict with myself, and exercised discipline, and I have been able to ward off financial issues for the past decade.  I haven't bounced a check for 15 years.


Over the years, I tried different things with my finances.  If it didn't work, I cut it off as quickly as possible.  If it worked, I kept with it, but never invested too much into one thing.  But, in the end, it was several years ago I came to the conclusion that simple was the best possible financial framework.


We have a short-term status:  that's the checking account.

We have a mid-term status:  that's the savings account.

And, our long-term status is the mortgage and 401Ks.



I feel fortunate to have the mortgage that we do.  The mortgage we refinanced four years ago from 6.75% down to 4.25%, which also reset it.  We only refinanced the balance, and for the past four years, I was paying 1/4 of the mortgage a week.  If you do the math, that cuts off about 1/4 of the mortgage in the end.  I just checked my amortization sheet, and I'm about six months, and $3000, ahead on the mortgage.  I recently cut the payment schedule back to the conventional one-payment a month.  Here is why:


A couple years ago, the wife and I were each putting $50 a week into the savings account.  Our expenses weren't growing very much, but we were getting nice pay raises each year.  It wasn't long before we had something like $15,000 in the savings account, and $5000 in the checking account.  On top of that, we hardly thought about money.  It just kept coming in, a portion got socked away into our savings, our 401Ks were growing, the mortgage was getting paid off quicker than it should, and we didn't bother about thinking twice when we wanted to buy something.  I helps that we have simple tastes, and aren't extravagant people to begin with.


Two years ago, I'll be honest, that amount of money just hanging out in our accounts was making me nervous, but I didn't want to stash it away in a place that wasn't readily accessible.  Since the day we moved into the house, there were definite improvements that we had in mind, so we decided that it was time to get those improvements done.  It was a way of investing in our lifestyle and living conditions.


The renovations went horribly wrong.  The budget almost tripled.  We were forced to empty our savings account and checking account.  I pulled some crafty and creative financial maneuverings, and we weathered the storm.


At the same time, my career suffered a serious setback that cost us $20,000 a year in income.  I made some adjustments that gave us some relief in our budget.  One of them was pairing back on the mortgage payments.


So, here we are.  The mess is almost done.  We just have a couple things left to do to the house.  These are things that need to be done, not want to be done.  The total, I am thinking, is going to be less than $10,000, and then that is it.  We are done with improvements on the house.  They are only a headache, and end up costing you way more than you originally intend.


We are surviving, but I keep watching our checking account going on it's rollercoaster ride.  We get paid, and then all the utilities and car payment come out, and we get down to dangerous levels.  And, our expenses seem to keep creeping up.


So, yeah, I miss the times we were having two years ago, before this whole mess started.  My wife is a real trooper.  She is in this with me, and we keep each other abreast of financial things all the time.  She supported me, and really saved my life, when things were on the line.  But, I just can't help but feel like a failure.  The devastating career mistake that I made, that I don't regret, ended up erasing 15 years of advances.  I feel as if I'm really back to scratch.  We are slowing rebuilding, but literally one dollar at a time.  And, at our age, I feel that we should be a lot further along than we really are.


I am truly lamenting our situation.  It makes me sick to think of all that was lost in time and money.  This situation will end up determining the rest of my financial life.


So, my main questions are, how different is my situation from other peoples'?


I understand that this damage to us is permanent and long lasting, but have others suffered the same setbacks and still come back?


Am I okay?  Am I actually behind, or am I ahead, and just don't realize it?  Or, if I just stick the course, will things eventually end up okay?  This is the main thing that I need to know.


In the end, I am considering doing a withdraw from our 401Ks of about $20,000 to finish the house work, and to get some thousands back into our savings account.  I have been doing some research, and even contacted the holder of my 401K to get the details.  We would have to suffer the normal tax penalties of 20% for federal taxes and 10% for the state of Ohio taxes.  So, that $20,000 will actually cost us closer to $25,000.  But, what I would gain in exchange is peace of mind, which is about the same value of $30,000.

Vancouver is an expensive city, I am currently living in a cheaper city and will be moving there in the next month. 

I am approved for a $15,000 student line of Credit. The cost of my course is $5500 +$375 for materials. The banker advised I take the line of credit and use it to live off for things like rent, etc. On top of that to take a $6000 student loan out to pay for my course. Her reasoning was that the student loan will be interest fee until 4 months after I am done my course. The interest rate on the loan is 2.9%. The student line of credit collects interest instantly, and will be based on how much money I withdraw from it every month. The line of credit is about 3.5%.

For example, even with me consolidating two of my credit cards back in November he said that when I finally pay the loan off if I keep paying the minimum  I will have paid 9,000 more with the interest.

(yes I would move out of this area to save money in a heart beat and move back to Ohio if it were not for my job industry) So, I feel each month more and more frustrated that I have a paying full time job and do extra part time work on top of the full time  but this debt is just sitting on me and is an embarrassment to me. The payment quoted to me yesterday was very easily manageable. (That is if all the companies agree to settle) The goal we talked about was lumping my private student loan (29,000) and credit cards (20,000) into one monthly sum so I can start to focus on paying my federal loans back and actually build a savings and private retirement fund. (I am 30) With the federal student loan debt I am 250,000 total in the hole. It's hard for me to even see that in writing, but hey I did grad school at NYU-expensive but totally worth it long terms in terms of experience and the job I landed.  If anyone can please let me know of thoughts, advice on debt settlement that would be great. I did look into debt counseling, but they can only change the monthly payment of each loan separately and I feel with my debt it needs to be in a lump sum.  Thanks!

personalfinance,"Recent college grad with no personal loans, only federal loans. Never had a loan before in my life so I am seeking some advice.","Hi all! So the time has come post-graduation to start planning to pay back my $34,500 in student loans. Below you see a break down of each loan and the interest.  

Im 29/M (not that it matters) and have worked in the service industry my entire life up to this point. I will likely be landing a temp-to-perm position that starts August 17th at $14.00 an hour until January 1st, which at that point, if transitioned to permanent would go full salary between $40k and $45k. I’ve never had any large debts that I couldn’t take care of in a month or two, and I’ve never in my life had a loan/car payment so interest and such are all pretty new to me. 

Which loans should I start paying first? Should I focus on the highest interest first and work my way down? Thanks. 

Loan A:  Principal balance: $3,500 – Accrued Interest $15.63 – Interest Rate 3.4%

Loan B:  Principal Balance: $6,000 – Accrued Interest $1,058.58 – Interest Rate 6.8%

Loan C:  Principal Balance: $5,500 – Accrued Interest $27.89 – Interest Rate 3.86%

Loan D: Principal Balance:  $7,000 – Accrued Interest $399.28 – Interest Rate 3.86%

Loan E: Principal Balance: $5,500 – Accrued Interest - $0.00 – Interest Rate 4.66%

Loan F: Principal Balance: $7,000 – Accrued Interest - $195.87 – Interest Rate 4.66%

These are all federal loans through NELNET. I am a bit confused because on my account snapshot it says my grace period is until 12/14/2015, but the “Due Date” listed next to every one of these loans says 2/9/2016. Can someone explain what that means?

My school and housing till graduation: $24,300

My only bill is my car which is $355 a month and can be lowered in the few months. My car is extremely fuel efficient and gas is less than $100 a month.

personalfinance,Need help in prioritizing my expenses/savings,"Hi All,


I'm writing this on mobile so please bear with me. Anyways, I would like some opinions on how I should be prioritizing my expenses/savings. 


Here is what our current situation looks like on a monthly basis:


Net Income (after tax)- $6000

Mortgage- $2200

Savings- $2000

Retirement savings (401k, 457b)- $400

Bills, home improvement, misc expenses make up the rest of our expenses. These vary from month to month. 


What I need help with is figuring out where any left over money should go at the end of the month. We bought a house 2 months ago at 3% down (conventional, not FHA) with a 4% interest rate and are paying $317 a month for PMI. This PMI will go away once we have paid down 22% of the balance. Currently, I have been putting an extra $400 a month to our mortgage in an attempt to rid ourselves of PMI more quickly. This makes our total mortgage payment $2600. 


We currently have $8600 in savings, buying the house took us down to around $3000 so we've been working on building our savings back up to a more substantial level. I know it is far below the recommended emergency fund level. 


For retirement, I have a pension with my employer and have started a 457b deferred comp plan. I contribute $130 a month and my employer contributes $100. My wife does not have a pension but has a 401k with matching, she contributes about $270 a month. 


Does this seem reasonable to you personal finance gurus? My concern right now is that maybe we should be saving more (either retirement or emergency fund) instead of paying extra on our mortgage, but I am admittedly quite ignorant when it comes to finances. If there is a better way to do things that would be benificial for us, I'm all ears.

personalfinance,Question about refinancing an FHA loan to a traditional; or Goodbye PMI!,"I purchased my first home for $200,000 in 2009 with minimal money down in an FHA loan with a 5% interest rate and about $80/month PMI. I have recently paid that loan down to under $175,000 and estimate my home's value around $225,000. I'm looking to refinance. Monthly payments include about $430/month escrow for insurance and property taxes (PA). Wife and I are both on the loan, we gross about $120k per year, and have excellent credit. Recently spoke with my current mortgage provider about refinancing:

Current Loan: 6 years into a 30 year FHA, 5%, $1,484.29 month

25 yr refinance: 4.375%, $1,281.72 month

20 yr refinance: 4.250%, $1,407.16 month

15 yr refinance: 3.625%, $1,588.37 month

That 15 year rate is awesome, but I'm really trying to free up some monthly cash flow with a new baby at home. Also, I don't expect to live here forever, will likely sell around 5 years from now. 

So I'm leaning toward the 20 year - I'll lose PMI, get a better rate than I currently have, pocket an extra $80 month or so, AND reduce my term by 4 years. I'm just curious about long term and what your thoughts are on refinancing in this situation?",finance,1438366590
personalfinance,Trying to refinance my car!,"Hi All! 

My situation has gotten better over the years but I am still climbing out of a hole I built for myself when I was 18. My credit has slowly crept up from 560 to now 630 (started to really work at in 2012 when I got out of school and got serious about my finances). My issue is I can't seem to find an avenue of relief when it comes to my car loan. 

I bought an Acura TL (2007) for $12,000 back in January of 2014. I understand I should have bought a cheaper car but I make decent money ($75k this year, 20 of which is heavily taxed commissions), and I justified it because of the small total amount of the loan and the immediate happiness it would bring me. The car is everything I could have asked for but unfortunately has me underwater right now. This is because it came with a 17% interest rate. I have made 18 on-time payments of $309 and still have about $9,800 left on the loan. My issue is I have already sunk so much money into the loan (about 5k) and I understand most of that went towards interest. I am trying to find a financial vehicle of relief though but no major companies seem to want anything to do with me or my loan! 

I tried Capital One (car was too old for them, only accept 7 years or newer) and BOA (bad credit, CS: 630). I have tried to acquire a personal loan from two different sources prosper and springleaf but no luck on either. Credit was an issue with prosper and springleafs refinance offer would have saved me $250 total, not even worth my time after they add in their $130 worth of fees. 

Is there any other avenue I can explore to help cut my interest rate down? Unfortunately, I can only save a few hundred a month after my bills. I am just so frustrated with this darn car loan and how much extra money I am giving away in interest. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks PF!",finance,1438368304
personalfinance,Lease miles versus car depreciation?,"Please bear with me, this is going to be a bit of a headache. My SO and I currently live in a one-bedroom apartment that is attached to a house for $800/month (w/d, garage, and yard all included). I recently moved into this apartment, despite it resulting in a 150-mile round trip commute 5 days/week (SO’s commute is 2 miles round trip). We have been looking at rentals that would split the different between our commutes, but the options are incredibly limited, because of the location and desire to rent not own. Additionally, our rent would increase by a minimum of $800/month for any sort of comparable living situation (our rent is currently discounted, because the house is owned by a family member and my SO works as a property manager).

We could go on living in this situation indefinitely, however, I have a lease on my car (a decision I regret, but it was made when my commute was 15 miles round-trip) and I am currently driving my SO’s car to keep my mileage low. After a few months of this arrangement, it doesn’t seem sustainable. I am running my SO’s car into the ground and I am still over on my own mileage from previous driving. I have 2 years left on a 45,000-mile 3-year lease and I have 20,500 miles currently on the car. If I start commuting in my own car, I will likely go over my allotted 45,000 miles by approximately 50,000 miles and owe an additional $7,500 when I turn my car in. Options I have considered:

1.       Break my lease and start a new lease contract with 25,000 miles/year at the same dealership where I got my first lease. I may still go over at the end, but it would be by a significantly smaller margin and I would be spreading out the additional mileage owed over each monthly payment instead of a large lump sum at the end of my lease period.

2.       Break my lease and purchase a car at the dealership and not worry about miles. I am less interested in this as I am hoping to get a car with better mpg, such as a prius, if I am going to be commuting so far every day, and I currently have a Subaru.

3.       Continue driving SO’s car and force it to depreciate faster than we can pay it off. It is a 2015 and already has 23,500 miles at about 11 months.

4.       Move somewhere more central, increase our monthly rent twofold, put miles evenly on BOTH cars, likely still go over mileage on my lease, but by a significantly smaller margin (probably only go over by 25,000 and pay $3,800 at lease-end).

5.       Move closer to my workplace and have SO drive own car into the ground and not have to worry about my own mileage issues. This would also involve an increase in rent. SO also works irregular hours and sometimes works with a shift ending at 10pm only to start the next morning at 6am, which sucks extra hard if you have an hour commute.

Does PF have any opinions on what makes the most sense for us to try? Am I missing any obvious solutions?  Is the federal $0.58/mile an accurate representation of cost for wear and tear on the owned vehicle (compared to the $0.15/mile I would pay for excess mileage on the lease)? Any insight on this would be much appreciated.",finance,1438368870

I'm trying to wrap my head around some of the changes that will occur financially and what I need to start doing now to prepare.

I currently work a corporate job with a salary of $47k. That said, I put in my 2 weeks recently and was asked to stay until the end of August. I don't currently have another job lined up, but have 2 interviews with promising opportunities over the next couple weeks. My previous job was a dead end and as someone who wasn't expecting a kid at the time, I wasn't willing to work a job I hated for the sake of paycheck.

**My/GF Rent**: Currently $0. We have both been living at home to save money. Will obviously be looking for a place together in the next couple months. $500-700/month for what we will be looking for in my area. Would like to buy, but know I will have a lot of upward mobility career wise in the next 5 years.

**GF Savings**: $12k

**My 401k**: $6k, 5% contribution w/4% match

**My Debt**: Absolutely none, very lucky to have graduated school with no debt and no CC troubles. 
**GF Debt**: She still has a year left of school. Going to be interesting as she is student teaching starting in 2 weeks. Will graduate with about $13k in unsubsidized loans. After the 6 month grace period I believe the interest rate is 9% 

**Car**: I have a new car that I have been reimbursed on each month for by the company. Haven't paid a $ to own it out of my pocket. Will get August's car allowance before my time is up. Still have $22k and 50 months left on the loan. Plan to sell for the payoff amount and buy something used around $5-6k. 
**GF Car**: $0

So far, I think I'm taking the right path. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Anyways, I have two questions about private student loans.

1. Fixed vs Variable: Is this basically an educated guess on whether interest rates (specifically LIBOR and Prime) will rise vs fall? I understand that they're historically low at the moment, so I assume that I would be better off taking the fixed rate as interest rates have nowhere to go but up.

2. What options do I have if I'm able to pay my loan off sooner than the terms state? The base of my loan is relatively small, but the shortest length loan I'm offered is 5 years. Could I restructure this loan after graduation if I secure a good job that allows me to pay off more, sooner?

-My annual tuition and fees will be roughly $65,000 (before books and the like).
-My parents just got me a 4 year lease on a car that will total about $16,000 over the course of the lease.
-My apartment is about $600/month before utilities. I think it is reasonable to estimate that my rent will remain somewhere between $600-$700 over the next four years.
-I have about $15,000 in mutual funds and such.
-I am very fortunate that my family is very comfortable financially and very supportive, but I want to be more financially independent and don't want to keep being a financial burden on my parents.
-My school has deemed me eligible for  $42,700 in Unsubsidized Stafford loans and $45,600 in Grad PLUS loans. These numbers are for the first year. I will presumably be eligible for roughly the same numbers all four years. 

My parents have suggested that I take out $30,000 in loans for the first year, I use a portion of my own money (probably around $5,000), and they will cover the rest (including housing). They also said that the amount they contribute will likely drop after this year due to other family costs that might come up.

Is my feeling that I should be taking out more in loans in lieu of my parents contributing so much reasonable, or is taking on extra debt a silly thing to do at this stage? Regardless, I should be maxing out my Stafford loans (5.84% interest rate) before taking out any Grad PLUS loans (6.84% interest rate), right?

ve finished school to make one larger payment to start things off?

I did some research and it looks like private refinancing is a viable option for me since the protections that come from the loans still being federal aren't doing me any good (my interest rates mean that IBR or deferment plans would be a disaster, and law jobs in fields that would qualify me for public service forgiveness are damned near impossible to find).

Edit: * a word

--------

Update 1:  I now have a lawyer (my company provides one for 30 minutes, once a year, on demand, by phone) who gave me some advice on where to go from here.  Right now, he said I need to document everything (which I already knew and have been), and I need to ride out what the state is going to do with the information.   I also have homework and am going to fedex them letters tomorrow, informing them of who I am, what they have done, threatening legal action if I am not compensated IN FULL plus additional amounts for hardships endured due to the lack of money, the lack of interest, the lack of investments gaining interest, penalties incurred, etc...   He also told me to mail a copy to the Governor, and the State Attorney Generals office.


The reality that this lawyer told me to face is that I must go through the states appeals process first and see if that works.



I also managed to get this information:

County: Los Angeles

Sex of the person involved: Female (I am male)

Name of the person: G***** C*******  (my name is D**** R***)


They also acknowledged that there has been an error and it is clearly not me, though they will have me attempt to prove that with the fraud department in the next seven days (or so).

Edit 2:  For clarity; the only thing that matches is that they typo'd, and have admitted to such, my SSN onto this other persons record.

Edit 3: Everything is on hold until Monday when I will be jumping through a thousand hoops.

All to prove that I am me, and that California has the wrong person.   The Bank of America person helped me IMMENSELY.
