So the question is, I have new york residency, my driver license and everything still has my new york address, but I'm a graduate student in Indiana and recently started getting paid by the university. I see that federal tax and IN state/county tax are being withheld from my paycheck, but do I have to pay new york state tax? Next year do I have to file tax in New York too? I'm a little worry I will get double taxed by both states - graduate students are already dirt poor.",finance,1438388033
personalfinance,Pay off low interest loan or invest?,"I have an auto loan with a low interest rate that I'm set to be paying off until about ... Sept 2017. It was a used car, payments's aren't too high, I certainly have them budgeted. Recently I got a job that exceeds my cost of living in pay. 

Here's the quandary: my auto loan is like 3% APY (is that the right acronym?). I also have a very undiversified stock portfolio that is doing like 7-10% a year in growth (luckily!). Does it make sense to put my extra cash into diversifying my portfolio in the hopes I'll net more consistent returns? Or would I be better off paying off my debt sooner?

My thought process is that if I can earn more than 3% interest with my money by investing it,  it's better to do that than to reduce the principal of my loan.

Am I crazy?",finance,1438389143

gaming,The greatest videogame experience possible to an open mind.,"So i've been drinking a bit, i won't lie. I'm in a certain state where my mind is filled with nostalgia and spiritualism, i can't quite put it to words. So i'm listening to the soundtrack of a certain game, a game which i can honstely say changed my life, my perception. It changed who i am.

I've played many different games in my life, from JRPGS to sandboxes to puzzle games to FPS to racing games. You name it, you say it, i've experienced it. 

But... i don't know, i can't grasp what's so special about this game. Story written in a manner i can't put to words, you get engulfed in it, you get immersed in a way only you can experience and me writing it can not in any way bring any emotion closer to actually experiencing it. Imagine drugs, many people ask whats it like but its hard to put it to words.

The Fallout saga, the Final Fantasy series, the GTA universe, the Sonic Adventure games, the Grandia series, the Gran Turismo games, the Chrono series, the Mario games and many many others. What do these games have in common to a person like me? Nostalgia. I grew with many of them, i share many memories with these games. Funny how one game, old arguably, which i found out about  recently (early-mid 2014, finished it in mid 2014) has become a unique experience. What do all these games lack though? Sure they are immersive, sure they are beautiful games, sure they are good structured games. But what holds them back? 

It's philosophy, awakening, spiritualism, beauty. As i've said before, i can't put to words what sets this game apart from all the other 200+ games i've played in my life, but i'm here with a whisky glass and some peanuts writing this as off now, talking about it. Why? Nostalgia is a very powerful and numbing sensation but i didn't grow with this game so, why am i so fond of it? Why do i hold this game in such a high regard, almost religious?

I'm taking some of your time so i'll do the best i can to try to describe it. The way its written, the way its story grows over time, the way it develops with the characters, the way it immerses you, the soundtrack itself. The first time i played i didn't think much of it, but i persevered. And to this day i found quite possibly, to my eyes, the greatest artistic work of our time.

The game i'm talking about is Planescape: Torment. If you've never played it please, do yourself a favor, experience it. Now, if you'll excuse me, i'm off to bed to relax and try to reach a sober state in hopes of waking up tomorrow remembering what i just wrote.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, this masterpiece (above masterpiece) is also available as a novel.",technology,1438397260

investing,"Worker Pay in U.S. Rises 0.2%, Smallest Gain Since 1982","For anyone drinking up that ""economy is getting better!"" kool-aid. Here's a hint, it isn't. UE figures mean jack without considering overall aggregate workforce numbers *AND* wages. As an extreme example, if you employ the entire country for 10$/hour, you're not doing better even though you have full employment.

Fat chance the Fed will raise rates anymore than just a token rate increase this year (so they can quickly slam it back it down the second things get sketchy).

-------------
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-31/worker-pay-in-u-s-rises-0-2-smallest-gain-in-records-to-1982

Wages and salaries in the U.S. rose in the second quarter at the slowest pace on record, dashing projections that an improving labor market would boost pay.

The 0.2 percent advance was the smallest since records began in 1982 and followed a 0.7 percent increase in the first quarter, the Labor Department said Friday. The agency’s employment cost index, which also includes benefits, also rose 0.2 percent in the second quarter from the prior three months.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are counting on rising wages to boost the economy and bring inflation closer to their 2 percent goal. The setback may prompt some officials to call for a delay in raising interest rates for the first time since 2006.

“You’re really not building up the tightness that everyone says,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, who projected the overall ECI would rise 0.5 percent, among the lowest estimates. “For the people who were saying the Fed’s got to raise rates in September, this is a shock.”
The yield on the benchmark 10-year note dropped to 2.21 percent at 8:47 a.m. in New York from 2.26 percent late on Thursday as investors weighed what impact it would have on Fed policy. Stock-index futures rallied after the report.

Survey Results

The median forecast of 57 economists surveyed projected a 0.6 percent increase for the total ECI index. Last quarter’s reading was lower than all estimates, which ranged from increases of 0.4 percent to 0.8 percent. The gauge measures employer-paid taxes such as Social Security and Medicare in addition to the costs of wages and benefits.

Wages and salaries typically account for about 70 percent of total employment expenses. The ECI data help color the outlook for worker pay after the June employment report showed average hourly earnings rose 2 percent from a year earlier, matching the average since the start of the expansion six years ago.

Because the ECI tracks the same job over time, it removes shifts in the mix of workers across industries, which is a shortcoming of the hourly earnings figures.

Wages of all employees, including government workers, advanced 2.1 percent from the same period in 2014 after climbing 2.6 percent year-over-year in the first quarter.

Private Wages

Private wages were little changed in the second quarter from the previous three months, the worst performance since those records began in 1980.

Wage growth has been slow to respond to indications that the labor market is tightening, which would normally cause managers to feel pressure to boost pay amid a smaller pool of workers.

Job openings climbed in May to 5.36 million, the highest in records dating to the end of 2000, Labor Department data show. There are about 1.6 Americans per available position, matching the lowest level since September 2007.

Surveys of small businesses, at least, show managers aren’t planning on further need to raise wages in order to attract and retain employees.

A net 11 percent of managers in June said they plan to increase pay, the fewest since January 2014, according to 620 responses in a National Federation of Independent Business survey. A net 21 percent said they had already recently boosted worker compensation.

Payroll Gains

Wage growth has been slow to emerge even as the job market strengthens. Employers have added an average 208,300 positions a month this year compared with 259,700 in 2014 that was the best in 15 years. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg project 2015 will show a 220,000 average, according to a poll conducted July 2-8.

The unemployment rate is fast approaching the 5-to-5.2 percent range that Fed policy makers have defined as full employment. The rate dropped to 5.3 percent in June, the lowest since April 2008.

“The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment,” Fed policy makers said in a statement Wednesday at the conclusion of their two-day meeting in Washington. “On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.”",finance,1438414240

elite-gold-profitsElite Gold Profits is a new binary software that’s supposed to make traders over $1300 a day. The developers claim to have been in service since 2004 but their web site domain was only registered two months ago. I’m not sure why they are telling us 2004, but this certainly isn’t the right foot to be starting on.

Today I’ll be providing a review about this service and informing the Binary Today readers of it’s potential. I don’t have high hopes.

Elite Gold Profits Review

There are a few oddities on the Elite Gold Profits web-site that I feel inclined to reveal. First, as I established above this product has not been around since 2004. 
Secondly, this business is not accredited by the BBB despite having a sticker right underneath the video. This is false information and not something any developer should be doing in this day and age. The developer of the software is Nigel Pearson and he tells us that it’s his job to make rich people even more money.
If you look on the left hand site there is an insinuation that celebrities like Beyonce, Roger Federer, George Clooney and Oprah all use the Elite Gold Profits 

Software. I don’t believe this to be true. Nigel claims that he is done making millions for rich people and he wants normal traders to take advantage of his system now.  In the video we are shown images that look like they were made in photoshop. In these images we can see success rates of over 98% and traders making over $150,000 in jus 57 days. So basically, we are shown a bunch of get rich quick images, none that can be verified. The video also includes a bunch of testimonials from people that claim to be making big money with this software.

Today I won’t be recommending Elite Gold Profits to any of the binary today readers. There’s nothing here that gives me a shred of hope. There is no evidence anywhere online that Nigel Pearson is a real person. In my eyes, the whole purpose of this page is to pull in suckers that get distracted by celebrity images. I don’t feel that this is a true investment, and thus I have to pass on it. If there’s something you would like to add to this review please leave your comments below the article now. Now it’s time for me to do some real trading and get some wins in before bed, have a great night.

investing,22 y/o Advice on 401k and portfolio,"I just received my first paycheck along with a substantial signing bonus. Never having had so much money before, I blindly invested in a bunch of Vanguard mutual funds in a taxable account. I'm now beginning to have doubts about my allocation. 


Here is my taxable account portfolio:  
* $10K VTSAX Total Stock  
* $3K VGTSX Total International Stock  
* $5K VINEX International Explorer  
* $4K VWUSX U.S. Growth  
* $3K VGHCX Health Care Fund  
* $10K Discover Savings  

I am also contributing $800 a month to my 401k with the following allocation:  
* 40% VINIX Institutional Index Fund  
* 15% VEXRX Explorer Fund  
* 35% VTSNX Total International Stock  
* 10% VBTIX Total Bond  


Is this a sensible allocation, or do I have no idea what I am doing? I am a bit concerned that my portfolio is very heavy on U.S. stocks. I'm not too keen on bonds with yields being only marginally higher than my savings account and interest rates set to rise soon. But would it be a good idea to add more exposure to international stocks?


I should also note that my taxable account is mainly to save for a down payment, but that's at least 10 years down the road, so I am willing to accept some volatility. I'm not maxing out my 401k yet, but I may increase my contribution later on once I get a better sense of my spending habits. My spending has been abnormally high this month due to relocation costs and a lot of one-time expenses.

* $104.16 in Social Security
* $24.36 in Medicare
* $109.03 in California state taxes
* $15.12 in California's EE disability tax. 

After I changed my W4 form to reflect 2 exemptions, they took 

* ~~$298.59~~ $289.59 in federal taxes.  **edit**
* $106.74 in CA state taxes

personalfinance,Mortgage Principle Payments vs Investment,"Hey!

So I bought a house, and my first payment is due today!  Woot!  It's a $235k home with an interest rate of 4.5% and $2400 a year in taxes/insurance.  I budgeted the home to allow for over payments of at most $350, with another $350 set aside for investing, every month. My husband will contribute $250 for either investment or mortgage principal payments.    

I want to know if I should just stick to $100 a month paying directly to principal, while taking $700 a month to invest, do it the other way around, or pay all of it on principal.

If I overpay $350 a month, the home will be paid off 15 years, six months early, saving $116k in interest and another 501k by not owing home payments for 15 years and six months, totaling $617k I don't have to pay.  Only paying $100 per month makes it a mere $31k in savings and only pays it off 5 years sooner, a total savings or net gain of $115k.  

I've spent a lot of time reading about investing the last few days, and still have no idea how it works.  There's SPIA's, Secure/Insecure CD's, mutual funds, government bonds, corporate bonds, penny stocks, high interest savings, and gosh it's still just overwhelming and confusing.  Somewhere I read you can get over 10% interest and that 10% is today's standard, but I haven't found a single rate higher than 5% on any sort of investment.  Most of them range from 0.25% to 3% interest, sometimes seeing it jump up to 4.5% for risky deals.  For a 30 or 35 year plan, I'd like to be able to get up to a couple million for retirement.  

Would it be better to overpay on my home for $700/month and only $100 in the obscure concept of investing?  Should I just overpay $100 a month and put in $700/month investing?  Should I put $600/month into the home and put $350/month into investing?  

In other words, would I see better gains paying off debt significantly sooner while slowly compounding interest, or should I be compounding most of my budgeted money in a secure investment because the more you put in early on the more you get later on?

Oh and I have $2,000 I didn't expect that I either need to put on principal, or invest.

Halp!  Halp the financially inept returd!

Edit: Oh, it's worth mentioning too, that I have two motorcycles I'm still in debt on at ridiculously high rates(22%).  One I owe 12k, the other is only 2k because I've consistently overpaid.  The 12k one will soon be overpaid to where they won't even bill me for a few months, so everything will go straight to principal and it will be paid off in 3 years.  The mortgage totals to significantly more interest than those small loans ever will, even though they're way higher interest.

And there is definitely savings, but only for 2 months.  I'm reading suggestions in this subreddit to push for 6 months.  So maybe a high interest savings account at some credit union?",finance,1438420875

personalfinance,I feel like I'm throwing money away. What do I do with my leased car? Has 9 months left.,"I live in North Bay California. I have a 2013 Camaro 2LT that I got on a 36 month lease. I've only put 16k miles on it and I have 9 months left. I never ever drive (I hate driving) except to work which is less than 10 miles away.

I paid $2.5k down and so far have paid 27 months of $390 payments. The first year I had it my insurance was like $250 and now my insurance has been $120 the past year (I'm 24 so insurance rates will go down next year) I just feel like this is throwing money away especially because I got a bad deal on the car, I think.

So between the down payment and monthly payments I've put $13k into it. It has a residual value of $18,300 + $3,200 still left in monthly payments. I'm not sure what the hell my down payment went towards. Does it go towards the $18,300 so it'll be $15,800 if I decide to buy the car?

This isn't harming my finances by any means, but I just feel like I could be doing a lot better as I've been trying to buckle down on my spending.  What are my best options with this? 

Should I ride the lease out and buy it since I never put miles on it so I can sell it later? 

Should I offer to buy the vehicle right now? My FIICO is 750s so I'll get a good interest rate. My monthly payments would go down to $310 or so.

Can I go to a dealership and offer to trade it in to buy another vehicle (something like the major brand cars $15k~ range) because the end goal is to get a Tesla in a few years. I am not looking for any car in particular, just whatever I can find that a dealer/person needs to sell desperately. Basically what kind of numbers between selling my camaro(if that's even a good idea) and the other car would I want to be looking at to make things financially sound for the next few years since I want to get a Tesla later or to, in general improve my spending habits because $390 payments + insurance is too much.

For anyone to suggest an older car, I don't want an older car because I absolutely do not want to worry about any mechanical issues as I know nothing about cars and don't see myself learning too much about them as it is not my forte or interest. *edit add in* I also do not want an older car because I like the luxuries of modern cars and I believe since I barely put miles on my cars, they will have better resale values if I start fresh on them. *

politics,"Wild idea to address both student loan debt and a sluggish housing market: Pending pre-approval, federal lenders will defer loans at no interest yet still collect to place the funds in a savings account for a down-payment.","[This is, more or less, the phenomenon I'm referring to.](http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/24/real_estate/student-loan-debt-home-buying/) Ultimately, it doesn't appear to be that it stops new graduates from buying, just that it causes them to delay, and that delay in and of itself may have negative effects in terms of long-term wealth accumulation.

So, if you have student loan debt and the burden is difficult to reconcile with saving for a home, maybe the government can put them in a kind of semi-deferment. Meaning debtors continue to pay the debt, but the money actually goes into some kinds of savings account for a down-payment to guarantee that the money is saved, where the lender (not the student) can accrue interest (since I'm imagining this semi-deferment would be at no interest to the debtor and it would be a way to offset that). Then, when a home is purchased, student loans can go back into repayment and the debtor should be in a better financial situation to afford making payments on their student loan debt.

Of course, I'm sure there would have to be some conditions, but if at the end of the day it improves the picture overall, maybe it'd be worth it.",finance,1438441434

She graduated college in 2013 and hasn't been able to land a decent job.  She is currently working a job that is outside of her concentration.  It was best opportunity she had, but still not nearly enough for where she needs to be.  No benefits, no overtime, no retirement plan.  On top of the whole no benefits thing she technically makes ""too much"" for Obamacare so she doesn't even have health insurance (AND she has to PAY THE GOVERNMENT for not having health insurance.  This blows my mind.  She makes too little to afford her own, too much to get Obamacare, so obviously the right this is for the goverment to charge her a $300 a month penalty).  Her current monthly income is a couple hundred dollars UNDER her monthly school loan payments.  So not only can she not afford the loans, she is dead broke after giving them all the money she has.

So her parents aren't the brightest of the bunch, and didn't do much research when they went to take out her student loans.  From what I know she has been paying back the majority of her loans to Wells Fargo.  She owes them about $90k, and those payments were taking up 80% or so of her paychecks.  Today she learned she has ANOTHER PRIVATE LOAN to pay back.  This one for about $80k.  This is pushing her well over where she could handle financially.  (Side note, i am furious at her parents and the fact that now she needs to pay for her parent's stupid mistakes).

That's basically the story.  I'm here seeking advice for her.  She has tried consolidating her loans with Wells Fargo but they turned her down.  What options does she have?  Where can she turn?  Should we seek professional advice from a financial advisor/accountant/financial planner?  If so who do we turn to there?  Do we look for a small private accounting company, or one of the larger big name financial firms?  She is really dead in the water, and I am no help to her as all of this is another language to me.  PLEASE HELP.  Thanks for reading.

Also, figured it was important to note, she is currently looking around for other opportunities (job wise) but for two years now has had zero luck.  Where she is at now is offering her the most but the most is definitely not nearly enough.


EDIT

Ok so after talking with her some more, she actually believes she DIDN'T sign any paper work, and thinks that all the loans are in her parents name.  Now at the same time, it's not like she wants to screw her parents over with these and say ""Oh well you signed the papers, you deal with it.""  I'm hoping there is something else she could do knowing this now?

Thanks for all the advice so far, it has really been helpful.  I would like to note however, there were a couple people ""shaming"" me and her for calling her parents ""awful"" (which I never said).  I do admit I may have been a bit frustrated with the situation, but neither I nor my girlfriend hate her parents.  I mean, I love her parents haha.  It's just a sucky situation, and I wish they could have done the research and gotten her federal loans instead of private loans.  That is all.

personalfinance,Which Student Loan Should I Pay Off First?,"I am currently in my last year of college as an undergrad and was wondering which loan I should try to pay off first? I have the Federal Perkins loan which has a fixed 5% interest rate and a 9 month grace period or a Subsidized Stafford Loan with a 3.4-4.66% (depending on the year it was taken out) and a 6 month grace period. I was planning on working on the 4.66% Subsidized Stafford student loan because it has the highest interest of my Subsidized Stafford loans and  only has a 6 month grace period so it accrues interest sooner. It also is less flexible than the Federal Perkins loan in terms of repayment (payment due monthly vs every 3 month) so that worries me as I don't have any for sure plans after graduation. 

Here is the nitty gritty on my loans:

Federal Perkins Loan
	5% interest rate: $3,200 + $1,500 + $900 + $900 = $6500

Subsidized Stafford Loan
	
3.4% interest rate: $2,800	
3.86% interest rate: $2,700

4.66% interest rate: $2,000	    
4.29% interest rate: $5,000	

Total Stafford: $2,800 + $2,700+ $2,000+ $5,000 = $12,500

Total Student Loan Debt: $19,000

It is also worth noting that I took out around $3000 more in my last year than I think I will need (interest only accrues after I graduate and my grace period is up) just in case and also to pay off another loan with a higher interest.

So I guess I am asking two questions:
1) Should I pay off my student loans by highest interest or lowest amount (ie. Dave Ramsey's debt snowball method)?

2) Based on the information provided which loan should I pay back first?

I have been really frugal lately and am really serious about paying off these loans once I graduate (as well as with my current part time job). Also, how much saved up ""emergency' money do you think I need?

Fortunately, this has allowed me to save a fair amount of money. However, I'm not sure whether or not this qualifies as ""earned income"" for Roth eligibility purposes. I pay estimated quarterly federal and state taxes on this amount, and I believe they are reported on a 1099-MISC rather than on a W-2. I have read a lot of mixed things on whether or not this counts as ""earned income"" since I do pay income tax on it. To further complicate matters, I also receive $1,000 weekly for my summer internships that I am required to complete.

personalfinance,How we paid off $14K in student loan debt in 2 years (in a $48K/yr dual income household),"Long time lurker under a different account, though I've only recently started posting under this throwaway for *reasons.*

**Here's my story:**

When my husband and I graduated from college, we immediately got married.  We didn't have any savings (we'd spent it all on our very modest wedding), my husband had just started a new job as a production designer at $38K a year, and I began graduate school making $10K a year as a teaching assistant. 

My husband didn't have any loans to pay back after we graduated because he a) had a great scholarship and b) worked through college.  I, on the other hand, had a scholarship that didn't cover the entirety of my tuition and my part-time job couldn't cover all of my tuition and living expenses.  Over the course of four years, I had to take out private loans which did not qualify for deferred interest because of my mother's salary.  They accrued interest for four years at varying interest rates, so by the time all was said and done, I owed right at $14K.  Since I was in a master's program, I could have deferred payment, but my husband and I decided it was really important for us to get out from under those student loans as soon as was reasonably possible.  

**Here's what our finances looked like for two years:**

* Combined monthly take-home pay: $2,845  (My husband brought home $2,100 a month after deductions and various withholdings, I brought home a whopping $745 a month)
* Rent: $650
* Utilities: $200 (varied from month to month, but this was the average.  If the bills came in under, the extra would go into a slush fund for the more expensive months)
* Tithe: $285
* Insurance (car and renters): $150
* Phones: $100 (used very cheap TracFone style phones)
* Gas: $100
* Entertainment/Discretionary: $100
* Food: $400
* Mandatory savings: $100 
* Loan repayment: $650
* Any extra money we had at the end of the month went into savings to *very slowly* build an emergency fund

**Here's how we made it work:**

1. We were lucky enough to have older cars in good shape with no payments.  If we hadn't, we would have paid those loans off first before starting on student loan debt.
2. We relegated eating out to one meal a week, which was almost always fast food.  All lunches were sack lunches, and dinners were home cooked.  We shopped for all of our groceries at Wal-Mart, and we went for high protein, low cost meals.  There was a LOT of chicken and rice in our lives.
3. No TV, no internet.  We did use part of our entertainment funds to get Netflix DVDs by mail, so that helped with boredom.  Otherwise, it was whatever we could get from the library to read or watch, or whatever we could pull in over the air via antenna.  
4.  We asked for clothes for Christmas, otherwise it was resale shops. 
5.  We drove my husband's fuel economic car *everywhere.*  My truck was only to get me to and from work (15 miles) and we made sure to rent an apartment close enough to my husband's office that his commute was under five minutes (4 miles or so).  
6.  We picked an apartment close to shopping to cut down on gas and car maintenance. 
7.  **We were flexible about our loan repayments within reason.**  While we committed to try and pay $650 a month, sometimes *that just wasn't possible.*  For instance, we skipped paying loans back in December to pay for Christmas presents instead.  We also cut back once a year to float a week long vacation somewhere affordable.  **We firmly believed that we deserved to live a little even though we were in debt.**  We knew that we would only be young once, so we wanted to make sure to have some experiences, too.  That meant finding cheap entertainment when we could and looking for deals on fun stuff (i.e. buying a used DVD for $2 at the library book sale).  
8.  **We understood this time would pass, but the lessons we learned would be forever.**  While it was hard to say no to going out with friends and colleagues--and even harder making sacrifices about clothes, eating out, and things like that--we knew getting out from under student loans was really important for our long-term financial health.  We learned how to make-do on little, and have lots of fun without much cash.  We figured out how to cook decent meals on a shoe-string, how to say ""no"" to our colleagues and friends without being rude, and how to work together to compromise.  

**Here's what we DIDN'T do:**

* Borrow money from our parents
* Live at home with our parents
* Receive any assistance whatsoever from our parents outside of birthday and Christmas gifts 

Could we have reduced some of our expenditures to pay down our debt faster?  Sure.  We could have lived in a dinkier apartment for about $100 less, which probably would have reduced our utilities, too.  We could have sold my truck to lower insurance payments and gas expenditures, stopped tithing, and probably put $50 back into our food budget if we didn't eat out at all.  *But we didn't want to do that.*  We wanted to pay back my loans really aggressively while still maintaining a quality of life we could be satisfied with. 

I hope this helps some of you when it comes to to thinking about your debt.  I know 14K is small potatoes anymore, and I know many of you are doing this by yourselves.  I just wanted to offer a different perspective that might help!

personalfinance,Student Loan Early Payoff Question,"Hello Pfers,

I am currently a senior in college (2-3 semesters left) and lately have been looking at my student loans in terms of payment options. 

All of my loans are federal loans managed by Great Lakes with the total balance being ~28k with about 9k in unsub and the rest in subsidized loans. I have been thinking about paying back while still in school but would need advice in regards to following:

1) I have the possibility to take out about $3500 in loans per semester ($900 unsub and $2700 sub) but I only need $1500 since I am now making a stable income. Would it make sense to take out full $2700 sub loan and immediately apply the $1200 difference (2700-1500) to my loans? My thinking behind this is that the sub loan does not accrue interest and the money that I am paying will go towards the high interest loans first (unsub are 6.8%, sub 3.4-4.2%). Thus I would increase my non-accruing sub loan balance by  $1200 and reduce my accruing higher interest balance by $1200.

2) This is more of a question but are you able to specifically target the high interest unsub loans by speaking to Great Lakes? If I try to pay online it goes to the balance as a whole. 

3) Any other suggestions that may be of use. It may also be of use to note that I am planning come January to start paying $500-$1000 per month into the loans.

Bitcoin,"How long would we have to use bitcoin before we *should* expect to see an address collision (two private bitcoin addresses both being assigned to the same person). Well, buckle up.","Our planet has approximately 7 billion people on it.  But the population is growing.  
  
Eventually (and let's ignore the realities of communicating/synchronizing blocks across the vast distances involved in the cosmos) perhaps we will colonize other planets.  
  
So let's say we do.... instantly.  In fact, let's colonize **a billion** planets in our galaxy right now, each with seven billion humans.  
  
But that's not good enough.  What if we eventually colonize other galaxies too?  So let's say we've also colonized **one billion galaxies**, and in each galaxy we've colonized **one billion planets** each with seven billion humans.  
  
That's a truly universal civilization.  Good job, us!  
  
Now let's assume that starting this very second, all those people (our universal population of seven octillion) each begins to generate one million new bitcoin addresses *every second*.  
  
""WHY ARE YOU GENERATING SO MANY FUCKING ADDRESSES!  You're going to cause a bitcoin address collision!"" yells the supreme universal bitcoin chancellor.  ""STOP IT!""  
  
Let's pretend everyone's in on the joke, and they all ignore him.  
  
-------------  
  
With this insane number of humans, all generating a million addresses every second it would still take about 150 **billion** years in order for there to be a 50/50 chance of a bitcoin address collision.  For there to be approximately a 99% chance of a collision, the assholes would need to keep up this buffonery for about 400 billion years total.

-----------------------  
  
- 50 billion years:  If the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, by this time they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other.  Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.  
- 100 billion years: The Universe's expansion causes all galaxies beyond the Milky Way's Local Group to disappear beyond the cosmic light horizon, removing them from the observable universe.  
- 150 billion years: The cosmic microwave background cools from its current temperature of ~2.7 K to 0.3 K, rendering it essentially undetectable with current technology.  
- 450 billion years:  Median point by which the ~47 galaxies of the Local Group will coalesce into a single large galaxy.  
- 800 billion years:  Expected time when the net light emission from the combined Milkomeda galaxy begins to decline as the red dwarf stars pass through their blue dwarf stage of peak luminosity.  
- 1012 (1 trillion) years:  Low estimate for the time until star formation ends in galaxies as galaxies are depleted of the gas clouds they need to form stars.

personalfinance,Questions about Federal loan consolidation to take advantage of public service loan forgiveness,"Hi all, I earned my BA in 2007 and MS Ed in 2013. I've been working in higher education since 2006, but only recently learned I am eligible for the [Feds' PSLF program](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service).  According to the program's rules, eligible payments are only for select Direct Loan repayment plans, or for any Direct plan in which a payment meets or exceeds a payment amount required under a Standard 10-year repayment plan. Since I've been on a Graduated repayment plan since entering repayment in Dec 2013, I'm certain most of my past payments will not be eligible. 

--

So, I'm thinking about a) consolidating most (or all) of my loans into one new Direct Consolidation loan, b) signing up for an eligible repayment plan, and c) starting a new record of making 120 eligible payments to count towards PSLF. I don't plan on leaving higher education any time soon, as I love higher ed and my career is in instructional design and e-learning.

--

The first question is, is this a sensible action to take?  e.g., will the forgiven amount be more than potential savings of me switching to a different payment plan and paying off these loans sooner?  As it stands, the Graduated repayments are going to become a problem when the amounts start climbing.

--

Here are some numbers: 

--

Salary is in low 70s, not likely to exceed 75k any time soon. My bare minimum monthly expenses are around $2,200/mo (NYC). I'm most likely not eligible for low-income repayment plans. 

--

Type | Rate | Balance | Term | Repay start | Mos left
---|---|----|----|----|----
Dir Consol | 3.5% | $14,145 | 306 mo | 11/2013 | 285
Dir Stffd Sub | 6.8% | $8,437 | 264 mo | 12/2013 | 244
Dir Stff Unsub | 6.8% | $11,558 | 264 mo | 12/2013 | 244
Dir Stff Unsub | 6.8% | $1,937 | 264 mo | 12/2013 | 244
Dir Stff Unsub | 6.8% | $19,433 | 264 mo | 12/2013 | 244
Dir Grad | 7.9% | $553 | 264 mo | 12/2015 | 264

--

I've been making extra payments on the Direct Graduated loan to pay it off sooner since it has the highest rate. 

--

Not counting the Direct Graduate loan, my total loan balance is $55,510 and my weighted interest rate (if consolidated) would be 6.0% after rounding up by 1/8th of a point.  

--

Am I correct that consolidating will keep my term to ~300 months, but create a new Standard repayment amount that will be lower than my current Standard repayments under a 10 year plan, thus allowing me to become eligible for PSLF on month 121/300? Or, do they calculate eligible PSLF payment amounts based on a 10-year Standard repayment plan?

--

The only other option is to remain unconsolidated and pay these off more aggressively, starting with switching to something other than a Graduated plan. But if I can save some money in the long run under PSLF, I'd rather pursue that option. Currently, the [Fed repayment estimator](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action) is showing 120 months under the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) scenario, which is the only other plan eligible for PSLF for me, it seems (I make too much for the IBR and I'm not a new borrower, my first loan being from 2003). Since that's only providing me with 10 years, it seems moot, right?

I just can't seem to set a payoff goal in a reasonable amount of time (and therefore a reasonable amount of total interest) with a monthly payment I can afford. I have been reading about balance transfers to credit cards that offer 0% APR for fixed amounts of time. I found a great one that gives you that deal for 21 months and only a 3% transfer fee. I could stick to a payment that would let me do that, and avoid a big hit on interest.
The problem is, my credit score is 613. I highly doubt that's good enough for a card like that. Some of that poor score is due to late payments, which I think I can get under control pretty quickly.
My plan is to work on my credit score a bit before applying for a card with 0% APR to do a balance transfer. But I'm wondering whether there's anyway to reasonably guess whether or not I would be approved for a certain card. I know that my credit score takes a hit each time I apply, so I don't want to attempt to get a card like that until I'm fairly certain I'll succeed -- because that would hurt my credit score and push back the timeline to when I'll successfully be able to get a card like that.

I've recently started reading as much as possible on this subreddit and have sort of become obsessed with FIRE. I wish I had known in my early twenties and late teen years what I know now, but it's time to move forward with a plan. I never really post on reddit, but made an account just because I think this subreddit is so helpful.

I wanted to share my current situation and see if there is anything more I can be doing to achieve FIRE. I know one of the first things I need to work on is lowering my monthly expenses. I have a goal of retiring by age 35 and wanted to see if you guys think its at all possible.

4. My Roth 401(k): ~$5k (Just opened this year as well, 5% contribution per paycheck)
5. Fiance ROTH: ~13k
6. Fiance 403b Plan: ~16k

That's about it as far as income and savings accounts. Now for the debt/expense portion (all expenses are monthly):

1. Rent: $2,200mo (reduced by $500 month by renting out a room)
2. Cable/TV/Internet: $65

I also have about $60,000 in private loans with a 7% interest rate. My plan has always been to focus my payments on the private loans to lower my payments due to the higher interest rate. I plan on working for a year from home to pay off as much as I can before going to graduate school for another 4 years. I hope to pay off about $25k in the year from my private loans.

Right now I'm paying the standard repayment plan on my federal loans and my monthly payments are around $250. I've considered changing to another plan so that I can funnel more money away from the low interest federal loans and into the high interest private loans, but I don't want it to have unforeseen consequences down the line. 

I'd have to pay $150 starting off on the graduated plan but I fear this plan may hurt me when I finish graduate school and have higher loan payments than standard. 

I'd pay about $185 on both income contingent and pay as you earn payment plans. I feel the income contingent plan would be the safest bet for me, because I'm honestly not sure if I qualify for pay as you earn.

Some context: I have a citi forward card, I THINK it was co signed by my parents, not sure. I was a college student with essentially no credit when I got it. I have had it for over a year for sure, and I have paid ONLY the last statement balance each time, without really looking at the individual line items.

My question: Does interest rate on a balance accrue the day you obtain a balance, or does it only accrue on the balance beyond your statement balance. 

My dad literally told me that the credit card company will never make money off you if you pay your full balance (last statement, not current) on time every monthly billing cycle. However, my friends told me that interest accrues no matter what.

Example: Assume billing is at July 2. June balance is $200. If on July 1 I spend $100 (which is out of the June cycle and therefore due Aug) and I pay off $200 June balance the next day, does interest still accrue for the remaining $100?

What are APR rates? How can I find out the details of my card? I have never seen a line item that says anything about interest on my statement.

My plan is to cut down on all my excess spending and throw as much money at these loans as I can.

Is it worth it to go variable and throw more money each month to pay down faster? Or am I risking my credit by putting the loan in my name?",finance,1438552796

personalfinance,Buying a Tesla,"My friend keeps saying that he thinks it's not possible to buy a $35k Tesla in highschool with a minimum wage job. And this is how I did the math. Assuming your parents fully buy a car for you in the beginning for ~10k or so just to start off; You work 8 hour days 5 days a week for 2.5 months in the summer, and 4 hour days in the school year you make 11600 a year not subtracting the income tax. Which if the income tax is 10% then it would make 10000$ a year. So assuming you can take out a loan of 25k with a co-signer you would have 35k total and then you buy the car (and with a Tesla you get a 7500$ Federal tax credit). And you make 1600 a month in the summer (from the 8 hours 5 days a week) this would technically be enough to pay off the loan in 1 year because from the loan calculator I used it costs 1500.45$ a month to pay off the loan which would leave some money left over.

We can probably refi our student loans down to a variable rate of about 3.5-4 percent.  But if we do we will lose the flexibility of some of the government repayment plans.

VPN friendly(for those living in harmonious china): 

China’s leadership is preparing fresh fiscal spending to ensure that signs of economic weakening don’t put their 2015 growth target out of reach, a danger that was underscored by a deterioration in manufacturing in July. Ahead of the top leadership’s annual gathering at the Beidaihe seaside resort east of Beijing, the Communist Party’s Politburo pledged last week to make “pre-emptive” policy adjustments in the second half. Premier Li Keqiang highlighted one area targeted for spending will be a “severely outdated” underground pipe system in the nation’s expanding megacities.

Factories could use the work that such construction projects will bring, with an official gauge of manufacturing slipping to a five-month low in July. The release indicated a drop in new orders and jobs, adding to threats that include a near-$4 trillion rout in Chinese stocks and a fall in car sales that endanger Li’s goal of about 7 percent growth this year.

“Fiscal policies will be the key to growth stabilization measures in the second half,” said Zhu Qibing, a macroeconomic analyst at China Minzu Securities Co. in Beijing.“The government’s recent signals and policy direction clearly show that a new round of fiscal stimulus is coming,” he said. To finance the spending, China has enlarged a debt swap program for local authorities that’s cutting their borrowing costs, and is expanding the lending capacity at so-called policy banks -- government-run lenders that implement public-policy objectives. The People’s Bank of China may also free up more commercial-bank reserves to be used for lending, economists said.

**Dual Measures**

“We expect additional infrastructure spending as well as a RRR cut,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB, said before the official purchasing manager index release on Saturday. A private gauge, from Caixin Media and Markit Economics, is due for release Monday. A preliminary estimate of that index fell to a 15-month low.

Threats to growth mean Li and President Xi Jinping have had to suspend for now an initiative to rein in leverage in the world’s second-largest economy that soared under the previous leadership team of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao. While a booming stock market had offered one channel for reducing corporate leverage, that got constricted with the equities slide.

The Shanghai Composite Index of stocks fell 10 percent last week, arresting three weeks of gains. The China Automobile Dealers Association Friday warned that a continuing share decline could contribute to the country seeing the first annual drop in vehicle sales in more than 17 years.

**Airports, Pipes**

With the building industry hurt by an overhang of properties, infrastructure spending will be key to driving growth. Premier Li said last week that expediting the construction of a modern underground pipe system in China’s big cities will be a new growth driver, according to the People’s Daily website. China will also support construction of airports in central and western regions, the State Council said.

Urbanization has put strains on the utility systems in China’s big cities. Flooding has sometimes proves deadly, as highlighted by the loss of 79 people following a July 2012 rainstorm. Initial underreporting of the death toll on that occasion also spurred public criticism in the Communist nation.

“This move is intended to support activity growth,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Yu Song wrote in a July 30 note, referring to the plans to modernize urban underground pipe systems. “Without further policy support, growth is at risk of falling significantly below the official target.”

**Addressing Usefulness**

Spending in areas of underinvestment can boost short-term growth and help ease concern over the usefulness of government-led outlays, the Goldman analysts said. To fund these efforts, authorities may issue more local government bonds, prod agencies to utilize idle fiscal deposits, and keep monetary conditions loose, they said. Central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has already this year lowered the required reserve ratio twice, with an additional move targeted to certain banks, and cut benchmark interest rates four times since the start of November.

Officials are also acting to boost lending. The State Council said last week China will encourage banks to increase loan support for the tourism sector.

More directly, authorities are expanding lending capacity at the country’s policy banks. The central bank has put $48 billion into China Development Bank Corp., people familiar with the matter said last month. Export-Import Bank of China got $45 billion, and 100 billion yuan ($16 billion) from the Ministry of Finance went to the Agricultural Development Bank of China, Caixin magazine reported.

Weak overseas and local demand damped manufacturing in July, the national statistics bureau said Aug. 1. “We have seen no sign of recovery in the manufacturing sector,” said Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in Hong Kong. “We may see manufacturing bottom in the third quarter as the government continues and steps up measures to stabilize growth.”",finance,1438580759

personalfinance,"VHDA loan, 3% downpayment grant, no PMI and possibly no closing costs?","Hello Redditors,

I [M30] and my wife [F27, doesn't work] currently live around the DC metro area paying $1630 per month in rent (35% of net income) including utilities and parking. Our lease is about to expire in November and we will be moving from this apartment to some other apartment for cheap rent of around $1200-$1300 per month including utilities and parking. Wewill be doing this to save up for the downpayment on our first house that we are planning to buy next year.

However, our realtor proposed an opportunity that we are eligible for VHDA downpayment grant on a conventional loan since our income is below the limit for a first time home buyer. My wife will hopefully start working next year and that would work as the additional income. We have saved like $10k till now and with the fed more or less likely to raise the interest rates next year, we are considering this opportunity and need your advice.

The golden rule, obviously is to save for the 20% downpayment but if we were to buy a condo (1bed/1ba) for like $180k around the area (around the same mortgage as the rent), we would be saving the 3% VHDA grant (no obligation to payback), no PMI and hopefully no closing costs. That saves us around $30k if we were to buy now versus next year when we will not be eligible for the grant and the higher interest rates.

What do you recommend? Is it worth buying the condo and getting the 3% equity instantly and pay the same mortgage as rent or wait till next year.

TL;DR: Planning to move out of current apartment ($1630 rent including everything) and moving to cheaper rental apartment to save for downpayment to buy house next year. Also considering the possibility of buying a condo for $180k ($1600 mortgage) using the VHDA 3% grant for first time home buyer with conventional loan (not sure about this), no PMI and hopefully no closing costs. Have saved $10k till now and about $3k in debt with no interest till November which I can transfer balance using the 0% transfer credit card.

P.S: We spend responsibly and are confident to pay off the credit card till November without having to transfer balance or pay any interests.


  
  
  
  
**Update:** So here are some more details about the program. The program is VHDA Downpayment Grant Program with conventional loan which gives 3% of the house price as grant towards downpayment with no obligation to pay and no PMI. However, the catch is in the interest rate which is 4.625% for a 30 year loan. For a conventional loan with 5% downpayment on the same house, the interest rate is 4.375.

Using zillow mortgage calculator, I see that it makes more sense to go with the grant program than the regular one. Below are the two cases:
* [Mortgage payment of $2106/month with 4.625% interest and 3% downpayment](http://www.zillow.com/mortgage/calculator/payment/ModernPaymentCalculatorAdvancedReportPage.htm?{%22homePrice%22:325000,%22downPayment%22:9750,%22rate%22:4.625,%22term%22:360,%22propertyTaxRate%22:1.2,%22includeTaxesInsurance%22:true,%22includePropertyTax%22:true,%22annualHomeownersInsurance%22:800,%22includeHomeownersInsurance%22:true,%22includePMI%22:false,%22monthlyHOA%22:94,%22includeHOA%22:true,%22isARM%22:false,%22dti%22:36})
* [Mortgage payment of $2223/month with 4.375% interest and 5% downpayment](http://www.zillow.com/mortgage/calculator/payment/ModernPaymentCalculatorAdvancedReportPage.htm?{%22homePrice%22:325000,%22downPayment%22:16250,%22rate%22:4.375,%22term%22:360,%22propertyTaxRate%22:1.2,%22includeTaxesInsurance%22:true,%22includePropertyTax%22:true,%22annualHomeownersInsurance%22:800,%22includeHomeownersInsurance%22:true,%22includePMI%22:true,%22monthlyHOA%22:94,%22includeHOA%22:true,%22isARM%22:false,%22dti%22:36})

Now, suppose I go with the conventional loan with 5% downpayment, it will take me another year to save that up which means $1500 in rent down the drain i.e. $18k. Plus am losing on the free 3% money ($10k) from the grant program. I am assuming the higher interest rate makes up for the no PMI and I can re-finance the loan (the grant one) once I reach more than 22% of the principal.

Does it make more sense to go with the grant or I am still missing the point here? Thanks for your time and help.

news,5 Most Common Reasons For Bad Credit History,"Credit history is a low down of your past borrowing &amp; repayments, including bankruptcy &amp; delayed payments. This detailed account is compiled by credit rating agencies by gathering information from your payment history, high &amp; low bank balances, credit limits, and other sources. This information is then used for creating your “Credit Rating”. When you apply for a loan, lenders check your credit rating in order to evaluate the amount of risk involved in approving your loan. If you have a bad credit history, they may reject your loan application or hit you with high interest rates. As obtaining a bad credit mortgage in Toronto is not a piece of cake, generally people try to keep a check on everything needed to maintain a good credit score. However, most of them end up with things more complicated that they’d thought. The most common reasons which cause bad credit history are listed below.
bad-credit-mortgage-approved2
1.  Unemployment –
Not having a job in hand is a sure shot way to transform ones credit report into a nightmare. Unemployment initiates your struggle to make timely payments, which eventually leads to ruining your credit score. Being without a job also makes it difficult to get mortgage refinancing in Toronto.
2.  Late Payments –
Not paying the bills on time can play havoc with your credit history. Occasional late payments can still be ignored, however many consecutive late payments racked up by your side will be a red flag to credit reporting agencies. The creditor does not care whether you were unwell, your pet chewed the bill, or you forgot the due date for the payment. They simply want their money and no excuses.
3.  Charge-Offs –
A charge-off is also a common reason why many people receive bad credit. A charge off or charge-off is the declaration by a creditor that the debt is unlikely to be collected. It occurs when the borrower becomes severely delinquent on his/her debt and it becomes obvious to the creditor that he/she will never pay the bill. Charge-offs, therefore put a negative mark on your credit report.
4.  Excessive inquires –
One of the biggest mistakes people make that damage their credit score is applying for many credit cards at once. This results in multiple lenders requesting your credit history from different credit bureaus. Due to multiple inquiries in such a short time span, you are projected as too impulsive or desperate, &amp; the effect it has on your credit report is apparently negative.
5.  High Credit Card Balances –
Whether you have a good or bad credit score depends on the ratio of your total debt to total credit available. When your credit card balance increases, your credit score drops. There are many people who are left with a poor credit history because of charging their credit cards up to the limits.
If you do not want to be denied a loan, maintain a good credit history by avoiding the aforementioned mistakes. For more information, feel free to contact us!!!",finance,1438610741

* Payment 1 (early): $614.87 brought 23,100.00+(interest) to 22,571.47 

* Payment 2 (June, on time): $614.87 brought 22,571.47+(interest) to 22,571.47 

* Payment 3 (July, on time): $614.87 brought 22,571.47+(interest) to 22,571.47 

As you can see, there's no movement on my balance for the past 2 payments. So I contacted them to see why that might be, and they said: 

""We calculate interest on consumer loans using the simple interest method. Interest is calculated daily on the unpaid principal balance from the date of receipt of the last payment, until the date of receipt of the current payment. Each time we receive a payment, we first satisfy the interest and the payment protection for Primary Loss of Life, Disability, and Involuntary Unemployment (P3) that has accrued since the date of the last payment and apply the remainder of the funds to the principal balance. There is never any prepayment of interest. The formula used is as follows: principal balance multiplied by the number of days between payments, then multiplied by the interest factor .00041780821 (.1525 divided by 365 or divided by 366 for a leap year).

As an example, on 03/27/15, you paid $67.55 in interest. The loan was opened on 03/20/15, so seven days were between the open date and the first payment. Therefore, $23,100.00 (principal loan balance) multiplied by .00041780821 (daily interest factor for 15.25%), then multiplied by seven days, equaled $67.55 in interest due. The P3 is also calculated daily with a daily interest factor of .00011624657. The seven days of P3 was $18.79. The payment on 03/27/15 applied $67.55 to interest, $18.79 to P3, and $528.53 to principal, bringing the principal balance to $22,571.47. The next payment that was made on 06/17/15, was 82 days late. Therefore, $22,571.47 (principal loan balance) multiplied by .00041780821, multiplied by 82 days equals $773.31 of interest due and the 82 days of P3 was $215.16. The payment on 06/17/15 went to interest, leaving interest due of $158.44 and P3 due of $215.16. The next payment was made on 07/10/15, 23 days later. The 23 days of interest was $216.90, plus the $158.44 from 06/17/15, equals $375.34. The 23 days of P3 was $60.35, plus the $215.75 from 06/17/15, equals $275.51 of P3 due. The payment on 07/10/15 applied $375.34 to interest and the balance of $239.53 to P3, leaving $35.98 of P3 due. 

If a full payment is made by your next due date, 08/18/15, you will see the principal balance start to reduce. The amount of interest and P3 gradually decreases as the principal balance is reduced.""

Does this track? Are they penalizing me for a late payment when there was no late payment? 

This loan is horrible and I am about to make a big payment on it in order to bring it down asap, but the fact that the balance didn't move a single PENNY between my last 2 payments makes me concerned. For the record, I only paid the minimum for the last 2 because I ended up having a second surgery, was still recovering from both, and just put it on automatic payments until I could deal with things better.

Any advice? Is the bank right? I have never encountered a balance with full payments that didn't move a penny between months.",finance,1438619696

Due to my legal status, I am not eligible for any federal aid I know of. (If there are any aid that can help me, that would be great!)

I will be attending CC (community college) this year as well, with hopes of transferring to a 4-year college the following year. The expected tuition for the year in CC is roughly 14k/year and the 4-year college tuition per year is roughly 35k/year. For CC I can manage to save up and pay for and will most likely have difficulties paying for the 4-year college.

My expectations with my academic credits and the college I am looking at. I will probably have to attend the 4-year college for at least 2 years minimum.

**My question is, what is the best possible way for me to go about attempting to pay for my future tuition?**

**My current plan was to pay for CC with the money I currently have and hopefully by next year, my credit score will allow me to get competitive rates for private student loans. My main concern is that there may be a better way to approach this.

personalfinance,Girlfriend has terrible student loan debt and cannot get consistent information from loan companies.,"So I'm going to summarize her situation to the best of my knowledge. 

The TLDR version: Girlfriend has large student loan debt and cannot make minimum payments for long. What options are available? Talking with Sallie Mae doesn't help.

She took out private loans (Sallie Mae) ~10 years ago for her first BS degree, these have accumulated interest and and are now &gt;$100,000 and are causing the problems. 

She then switched institutions and completed a second BS and here she was using subsidized loans - these are not accumulating interest (yet) so not a problem at the moment.

Now she is in graduate school - which is paid for, so no loans. She makes ~ $1400/month and after living expenses takes away ~600.

After her first degree the Sallie Mae loans were deferred until school was completed. After her second degree Sallie Mae claimed that the deferment was only for 4 years and she had to start paying $750/month. She didn't remember agreeing to 4 years, so she asked for the recorded conversation and never received it. Since she couldn't afford to pay $750/month they offered a program that would reduce the monthly payment to $450/ month and the interest rate to 1% for one year. Later she was told that, in order to sign up for this program, she had to default on her student loans first. Defaulting caused all of the interest to be applied to the principal and raised the regular payment from $750 to $1500/ month. She then signed up for the program, so she has been paying $450/month to the company for the last year. The program ends in November and she is suppose to start paying $1500/month, which she cannot afford.

So she called again, wanting to continue this program ($450/month) since she still cannot afford the full rate (now $1500/month) and was told that she never had to default on her loans and then basically told her to call back later closer to the end of the year, which will be in October.

Sorry if that isn't very clear. We have talked with the financial aid office at school, as well as with the free legal counselor but they have said they cannot help. Every person she talks to at Sallie Mae gives different advice, some of them have blatantly contradicted others.

I'm wondering if anyone could give advice on what she should do?

personalfinance,Consumer Reports has released their two year survey of auto insurance rates and has attempted to deconstruct the pricing algorithm used by major insurers.,"Consumer reports has been [studying auto insurance rates](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/car-insurance/auto-insurance-special-report/index.htm) for the last two years, and using 20 test cases they have submitted quote requests in thousands of zip codes in the US. Using that information and subtle changes to the test cases they are reporting on how various variables affect your auto insurance. 

On why this report is needed: 
&gt; But over the past 15 years, insurers have made pricing considerably more complicated and confusing. As a result, “there is a complete lack of transparency,” says Birny Birnbaum, executive director of the Center for Economic Justice in Texas. Those new scoring models—though hidden from the public—are available to regulators on the condition they remain confidential. But because they’re so complex, “the regulators don’t have a prayer of being able to monitor them deeply,” Birnbaum says.
&gt; 

On the impact of credit scores: 
&gt; And your credit score could have more of an impact on your premium price than any other factor. For our single drivers in Kansas, for instance, one moving violation would increase their premium by $122 per year, on average. But a score that was considered just good would boost it by $233, even if they had a flawless driving record. A poor credit score could add $1,301 to their premium, on average.

On insurers raising prices on people they decide are insensitive to price change:
&gt; But according to Bob Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), who has studied price optimization, those models can also take into account measures that seem to be unrelated to car insurance. They include the number of iPhones and beers you have purchased, or whether you’re sticking with Verizon FiOS when DirectTV might be cheaper. While the CFA believes price optimization to be illegal because it unfairly discriminates, an industry group, the Insurance Information Group, claims that the states that have prohibited it have done so with no evidence that is is a detriment to the market.
&gt; 
&gt; Amica Mutual and State Farm told us they don't use price optimization. Representatives from Allstate, Geico, Progressive, and USAA declined to discuss price optimization.

I recently went on a hunt for better auto insurance after using progressive for 10 years and my personal experience supports what they found in their country wide report.

So before I was making $13/hour + 4% commission (roughly $700-$900/month) working 40 hours a week.

Now I make 45K/year + 2% commission (roughly $100/month)
working 40-55 hours a week.

My student loan has a current interest of 7.49% and I only have $89 of interest currently. Each months payment is $227. I never miss a payment and I always put down $300-$400 instead. 

My current credit score is 700+ and my only other large monthly payment is $500/month for rent.

I want to know if I should start saving money on top of making my normal payments, and one day just pay out a large portion or all of my loan?

or if I should refinance my loan, and try to get a lower interest rate?

The reason I want to do this is because I want to pay it off sooner so I can start to paying my parents mortgage. You see, they refinanced their house to pay off 125K worth of my student loans. I owe them big time and I really want to help out.

personalfinance,"$25,000 from relative, high student loans - what's the best way to use/save the cash?","So my grandmother is giving me $25,000. I recently graduated from a professional graduate program and have about $150,000 in loans (I just graduated in May). I am starting a 2 year position in September and moving to a city where I will need to purchase a car.

My parents suggested that I use the $25K to either buy a car (I'm looking at the Honda Accord rn) or to pay off some of my student loans. Instinctively I want to pay off my loans as quickly as possible, BUT:

I am interested in doing public interest or government work that would qualify me for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness federal program. This means that I could theoretically pay the minimum IBR/PAYE loans every month and have the rest of my loans forgiven in 10 years. With my current salary ($60K) FAFSA's calculator predicts my IBR payments to be about $300-400 a month. This is (obviously) SIGNIFICANTLY less money than I'd pay normally.

HOWEVER, my current job, while PSLF eligible, is a 2 year contract, and I have no guarantee that I'll be hired for a PSLF-eligible position at the end of the 2 years. SO, I run the risk that I'd spend 2 years paying minimum loan payments and accruing interest only to end up in the private sector.

A friend suggested I just sit on the money until I know where I'll be in 2 years, but I'm wondering if I should be doing something with the money (investing? I don't know anything about that) other than just putting it in my savings account.

Also I'm VERY bad with money and I honestly am not sure I trust myself not to borrow from that amount if I'm in a tight spot down the line, if it's mixed in with my usual finances. I'm trying to be better about my spending but I'd also like to minimize any temptations.

personalfinance,"Just got a new job, where to spend my money first and how to handle my income for the future","Hello PF!  I just got a new job fairly recently and I'm not 100% sure where I should be spending my money at just yet. 

My current situation:

Debts:

* 22k left on auto loan($550/month @3.5%) 3 years to go

* 24k left on student loans ($325/month payment) Most are between 2%-4% with one loan at $4.7k @ 6.3%

* 7k CC debt on one card (20% APR)

* 2.5k CC Debt on another card (0% APR for another 12 months)

* 4.5k CC Newegg/Amazon debt @ 0% APR for another 10 months

Financial assets:

* 8k in my 401k

At my previous job I was making between 85-95k in income(salary+bonus) so this was a manageable level of debt, however that amount was starting to become uncomfortable.  Fortunately my girlfriend was also making about 60k, so between the two of us we managed alright.  Part of the reason I built up so much CC debt was that I was unemployed for about 8 months last year and I just recently moved to a new state to shorten my commute.

Fast forward to the past few weeks:  I recently got a new job offer that I've accepted, salary of 120k, signing bonus of 20k, and about 120k of stock with a 4 year vest.    

I'll be moving to the bay area for this position which is incredibly expensive from what I can tell.  Right now I'm looking at renting a 1 bedroom for ~2500/month.  I'm not interested in commuting a long distance since I will have to focus on working to the best of my abilities, so I'm looking for a place within a 20 minute walking distance. With all of my expenses, I'm looking at about $4900/month, that includes my car, gas, insurance, student loans, rent, utilities, pets, food, and a $200/month entertainment budget.  This leaves me around $800/month to put down to my credit cards or anything else I need to pay off.  
I'm planning on taking full advantage of the 401k match at my new job just like I did at my old job, so that will be taken care of.

My main concern is where to spend my signing bonus.  After tax it will end up being about $13,000 in cash in hand.  My main thought is to completely pay off the $7,000 in CC debt on the 20% card.  I was planning on holding on to the remainder in a savings account, ~$6,000 which gets auto-debited to make my car payments.   With a decent amount of savings, I was planning on taking the $800/month I have extra to pay off all of my 0% lines before they start collecting interest.  With the new income/salary I should be able to pay it all off before I end up paying any interest, at least that's my thought.

My second point of concern, after one year at this new company I will end up vesting ~$30k in stock (20k after taxes) and potentially a cash bonus as well anywhere from $20k-$5k.   My thought there was to pay off my student loans and automobile with that cash. With the interest rates as low as they are, I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to pay them off, or build up a small nest egg instead.  If I have a nest egg I can still keep making car payments/student loan payments for a while, but if I suddenly lose my job, having no student loans or car payments isn't going to help me as much considering my other expenses.

My last concern, I don't see myself being able to afford a decent sized house in the bay area anytime soon.  With house prices in the 1-1.5million dollar range, It will be quite a while before I can save enough cash to put a down payment on a house.  With that in mind I see myself renting for quite a while and saving up as much as I can in the meantime.  However... I've always had it as a personal dream to get a nice sports car, in particular one that costs about $60,000. Does it make sense to finance the car with that in mind?  I want to be able to save enough $$ to put on a down payment for a house in the near future, however I think I will have to wait until my compensation increases quite a bit more until I'm ready for that.  I'm pretty young still, only ~27 years old so I feel like I can wait a few more years for a nice house, but I really want to get the sports car before I end up having kids and losing my free time.  I'm not really looking to buy the 2nd car though until I've paid off my current car and I plan on keeping my current car until it kicks the bucket as it gets great mpg and is very practical.

I'm a bit freaked out. I got laid off in 2001 and that resulted in us barely selling the house in time before foreclosure and having to file bankruptcy. I make enough money that I can easily make the payments, but it is stressing me out anyway.

Now that the bankruptcy is off of our credit reports, and we have financed a car and kept up on some credit cards, our credit is finally in the range where we are comfortable. It isn't quite back up as high as it used to be, but we are north of 700 now.

I have opted to NOT get a debt consolidation loan for the simple fact that I can do it myself. I don't need them to pay off my debts and make a single payment when I can do it myself, even though it might take just a bit longer.

Right now what is crushing us is medical debt. Long story short, we pay almost $300 a month just in medical bill payments to 7 different doctors and hospitals.

Here is the plan, which I want to post updates about every six months to you all for accountability and motivation:

* I picked up a side gig at work for the last couple of months, and I've asked to continue it. Any money gained from that will go 100% to pay down debt as it is what my mom calls ""found money.""

* Roll over the medical debt payments until it is gone. I know, it is 0% interest, but it can also go on my credit report as delinquent, so I'm going to pay it first. 

* Today my wife made a payment for $155 on a bill that only required $25. Next month we owe them roughly $20 to pay in full, so she can take the other $160 and add it to our regular payment on another bill. I think you get the idea. our largest balance right now is a bit over $300, so we should be clear of that medical debt soon, especially after I get my final check for the side gig.

* Once that is gone, I'm going to roll it over onto my smallest balance credit card, so I'll be making huge payments and it will be wiped in 3 months. Then onto another card and so on. I know it will cost me interest, but he emotional/mental gain of having a $0 balance on more than one thing will be worth it to me.

* I know I should pay off the highest interest ones first, but something happened today. I qualified for a personal line of credit from the bank for $7,500 with a MUCH, MUCH better interest rate than two of my cards, so I'm going to transfer the balance to that and save $800 or so in interest payments.

* I get very large tax refunds due to the kids and whatnot, (between $6,500 and $7,000) so I plan to use that for the next few years to make one-time massive payments on some of that debt on top of whatever I'm rolling over.

* I should be debt free other than the house and car in four years.  

* On top of that, we got a pay raise last year and this year that we won't see on our checks until this year. (It was paid in lump sum - the new rate of pay will be reflected on our next paycheck) I plan to take the difference between my old check and the new one and use it for this plan.

* I should have the new car we bought in November (which we badly needed) will be paid off early, a few months after the credit debt is wiped. 

* Finally, I plan to save about $200 a month, which I can use to pay off debt as well, but cutting cable. Instead I will go with a Hulu Plus and Netflix account.",finance,1438642015

Purchase price - $157,500

Current Balance - $139,000

For the past five years I have lost $155 per month, as I was charging $950 in rent per month. I have installed a new furnace, new glass door and a new evaporated cooler.

The rental market has gone up and I can easily raise the rent to $1,075 and only lose $30 per month. I think at best I can sell it for $165,000 and at worst $158,000, but when I factor in closing costs, realtor fees, the house possibly sitting on the market for a few months and having to cover the mortgage with no rental income, unless it sells quickly, I stand to lose a lot of money.

On the other hand, I am tired of being a landlord and don't want to be responsible for any more repairs.

That joint income is set to rise by ~13k for this next year (from now til this time next year).  We have no foreseeable increase in our living expenses; same apartment lease as last year, same car payments, etc.

She has ~ 60k in student loan debt @ 2% interest.  I have ~25k in student loan debt at ~5.5% interest.  We are trying to decide how to proceed.  She thinks she wants to start a Roth IRA as a supplemental retirement account.  She already has a 401k that her company puts 9% of her pay rate into.  We have also talked about her starting some sort of fund for future expenses; wedding, house, car, etc.  We think a tax free money market mutual fund would be best for this.  Is there something else we should look into?

For me, I think my best interests are to pay down my student loan debt, since my interest rate is higher.  I think I can manage this in the next 4-5 years (by the time I finish graduate school).

Yet I realize that there are major expenses in one's life that require a good credit rating/history to get a loan for (car, house, etc), but I'm too afraid to get a credit card of any kind. Not so much afraid to get the card itself, mind you, I just know I tend to go overboard on a lot of things, so I try to refrain entirely from activities that have the potential to become self-destructive when overdone (drinking, drugs, and things like that). I just know that if I were to use credit cards the way that most people do, I would be in debt up to my eyeballs at the drop of a hat. I'm already a fatass because I'll go overboard on eating, but I can't cut out food entirely without dying.

As it stands currently, I've been paying off my federal student loan from college every month, on time. But eventually I will have paid that all off.

My dad promised me he'd help me pay whether it was his bonuses on my loans or the money he'd get from my grandma selling her uptown Manhattan apartment (which I don't think is happening). Here is my problem: **I can't take out private loans** because my parent's credit is horrible and no one in my family wants to co-sign.

 I managed to squeeze ~10k in federal loans (including the PLUS loan denial), $2,500 in FWS *(but that can't lower my loan amount)*, $4,500 in a VGAP grant, and $626 in a pell grant. My cost of attendance was ~27k, but I knocked it down to ~22k before any of the above is subtracted. This leaves me with a $7,630 gap I need to fill. Here are my questions for this bit..

- Was it accurate for my dad to include his bonuses on my FAFSA?
- Does FAFSA not take income-to-debt into consideration? Because my dad is in a LOT of it and my mother doesn't work (and is in debt). 
- Is there anything I can do in-order to still go to GMU? Payment is due the 31st, but I just found this out recently.

I have given up on my dream to go to GMU, but i'm still going to call to see if anything can happen. Now, i'm just wondering if I should take a year off and start CC next year or what. The deadline for any financial aid action for my local CC passed, and I let it pass because my dad was SURE I was going to GMU. 

Honestly, I am so clueless as to how I should start my adult life financially and I would really like some advice if GMU cannot work out.

Single mom, 29 years old. I make $31,200 a year before taxes and deductions. After everything, I make approximately $22,300 a year. $860 a paycheck, every two weeks.

Ok, here's the thing. I filed bankruptcy last year, in July 2014. My attorney sort of lead me to believe I could have my student loans taken care of in the bankruptcy (they're private loans, not federal). But apparently they can't because I'm still receiving calls regarding payments. As of now, I can't afford the payments. And unless I suddenly get a job making considerably more money (which is unlikely because I wasn't able to finish college and therefore have no degree), I don't find myself being able to afford payments to my student loans.

So, what are my options as far as becoming a homeowner one day? I realize it's silly to think it's a possibility with me unable to even afford my student loans. But I do pay my rent...and I stash away a little bit of money a month. My rent is $735/month. I know there are houses I could purchase with payments lower than that. I don't know, I just want my son to have a home... I'd like him to grow up in a house, like I was fortunate enough to be able to. I don't want him in an apartment his whole childhood. 

Someone please help me with some advice...even if the advice is, ""give up on your dream of ever owning a home, it ain't gunna happen."" I'm sure there are some variables that I didn't provide, if so please ask and I'll post them. Thank you so much in advance. 

 I am a long time lurker, first time poster. I apologize if this has been asked before, I'm on mobile and did a search and nothing showed up.

Edit: I knew you all would ask for the specifics, so here's a breakdown. I'm copying and pasting from a comment I posted. If it looks like I may have left something out, please ask. I appreciate all of your help. You all are wonderful.

Student loans are about $44,000. Interest rate is variable and last I checked were at 4%, but they've gone as high as 8% over the years I was paying on them. No degree, I wasn't approved for another year of student loans, and therefore couldn't finish. I'm a banker. Ironic, I know.

Expenses:

Rent: $735

Utilities: ~$100 (budget at this, usually 70 though)

Cell phone: $40 prepaid plan 

Car insurance: $182.22 (so expensive, but it is the best rate I could find)

Renter's insurance: $16 (required by my apartment complex)

Daycare: $500 

Groceries: $300 

Gas: $160

Meals out: $60 

Clothing: $25

Household: $50

Free spend: $100

Movies: $10 (for the occasional Redbox movie or two)

Savings: $140 ($100 into a general savings and $40 into a minor UTMA savings for my son)

""Car savings"": $200 (I had a car payment of $200 for 6 years that recently ended, I've begun to put that payment into a savings account)

I don't have cable, I don't have internet. I don't have Netflix or Hulu. I access the Internet on my phone and occasionally for a few minutes before work on their computers (which isn't often because most sites are blocked).

I purchase a zoo and science center pass yearly so my son and I have something to do on weekends, holidays, days off...that way we have a place to go that's already paid for to entertain ourselves. 

In regards to daycare, my son is turning 4 here soon, so by next year this figure will hopefully be less - will still need to pay for before and after school care, but that should be much less than full time daycare... I hope.

My son's father pays me $220 a week to help with my son, plus the car insurance payment also covers his truck, so it also goes toward that.

I also forgot to mention, that these figures as far as savings goes are all ""up in the air"" because I've had to dip into my savings several times for different situations.

personalfinance,Is this a decent mortgage interest rate in our situation?,"My wife and I were recently approached by our landlord about buying the place we rent. He said that he needs to sell it and wanted to come to us first before he puts it on the market. Our rent is low for the area in which we live.

We were not planning on buying a house yet, but rebuilding our savings and credit in anticipation of being able to afford one. We have a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was discharged a little over 2 years ago after we made the final debt repayment under the terms of the bankruptcy. So far we have saved just under $2,000. We have 1 credit card that we only keep a small balance on sporadically, and a car payment around $200/month.

My wife is the sole earner. She makes around $60k/year. I'm a stay at home dad with our one child.

While we were planning on renting for a while longer and repairing our credit, after being asked by our landlord if we'd like to buy, we thought about it, and actually like the idea of paying toward our own property instead of paying off someone else's property.

We went to a bank see if we qualify for a loan. My wife's 3 credit scores are 704, 708, 728. She has a couple of old collections on her credit that total about $600. One is a medical bill and the other is a utility from a city in which we lived several years ago. 

Since we do not have enough in savings to pay the down payment, the lender suggested that we go with a program for first time home buyers which gives us the down payment for 0% interest and an FHA loan. The monthly payment would be around what we are paying in rent. Our debt-to-income ratio on the new mortgage would be several percentage points below 28%. In fact, our entire debt-to-income ratio including the mortgage payment is below 28%. 

When we first started talking, he mentioned that the market rate for loans is around 3.6% right now. But once he gave us the loan pre-approval, the rate we were given is 4.75%.

Is this a good rate in our situation? It seems like a big jump from 3.6%, but I don't really know much about it. On the other hand, it seems like a no-brainer for us to pay our housing expenses into something we own instead of someone else's property.

Is the ~1.1% increase over the market rate to be expected in our situation?

I'm an engineer, so as my career progresses, I'm not too worried about being able to pay it off. I have an Excel budget spreadsheet I use to track every dollar I spend. It's based on the YNAB concept, but tweaked it slightly for myself. I'm a careful spender, but I have no interest in living like a broke college student for the next 5 years to get myself out of debt. I read stories on here about how people are proud to say 'no' to meeting friends for dinner because it means they're sticking to their budget and ""building a better future"". I can't connect with that. I don't see the benefit of living that type of lifestyle right now, in exchange for more freedom in the future. Call that shortsighted if you want, but I'd rather be able to do things with friends and treat myself to something nice occasionally, even if that means paying more interest in the long run.

Now that you understand my mindset, I'm having a hard time balancing that with the fact that my loans *do* cause some amount of stress and make up a non-trivial amount of my monthly budget. In the next couple months, I expect to receive a sizable work bonus. Probably around 15% of my annual salary. And I can't decide what to do with it. On the one hand, I have one loan that I could pretty much wipe out by using my entire bonus. It would save me nearly $75 a month on that payment. Or, I could contribute to the IRA I set up earlier this year (my loan interest rates are all 4% or less, so I feel comfortable directing some money towards long term savings).

But in the end, it feels so insignificant. In the short term, that bonus is no small amount of money. But in the long term, it will change my debt from $40k to, say, $34k. That's progress, but it won't really change my day to day spending, stress, or long term goals. I feel like I'm never going to make significant progress until my career progresses a bit more, so I'll be treading water one way or another. And if I tread water a little harder (by using this bonus on loans), I might raise out of the water slightly, but it's not going to propel me out of it anytime soon.

I guess I'm just looking for any tips towards changing my mindset that any dollar I contribute now will actually be worthwhile.",finance,1438698428

We bought our house back in May of 2014.  We got an interest rate of 4.5% with 5% down, however that includes PMI.  The house was appraised at $311K, we purchased at $302K, and it needed a bit of work.  We currently owe $283K after down payment and monthly payments.  We have recently underwent a major renovation, including new roof and gutters, new windows, brand new kitchen, bathroom, and bedrooms redone, as well as the electrical and plumbing upgraded.  We had over $40K worth of work done, including a lot of things we did ourselves (removed wallpaper, repainted all rooms, refinished hardwood floors, laid laminate floors where there was no flooring, etc.)



Just this week, our mortgage officer reached out to me because he got a job at a new bank and wanted to see if we were interested in a ReFi.  He said he has looked at comps in our area, and they have come in at around $340K and that does not include the work we have done (its a 4 bedroom, 2 full bath).  The first option, if we do not end up getting 20% equity on the appraisal, is 2 mortgages.  First mortgage of 269,900 at 4.25 APR with a 30 year fixed rate (with a closing cost credit).  Second mortgage of 16,400, 2.49% first year – then prime for life – prime is currently at 3.25%.


The other option is that we end up getting appraised over value to the point where we have 20% equity, and do not need the second mortgage.  Both options get rid of the PMI.  We are currently paying almost $200 a month for PMI and I have been looking to refinance anyway.  This scenario overall currently will be saving us about $500/month just on our mortgage payments, which obviously would be ideal.  That being said, is this too good to be true?  What is the catch?  What are the cons to this situation?  I guess one thing I can think of would be that variable prime for life rate, but how bad is that?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!

personalfinance,Best Plan of Attack for Repaying Student Loans?,"I'll preface this by saying I am in the US. Graduated in May, starting a 6 month internship in 2 weeks making $720/wk **before taxes**. I have six federal student loans in varying amounts with varying interest rates, with two of them subsidized. My grace period on the loans ends early November, with first payments due early January. Here is a summary of the loans themselves:

Subsidized:

* $3,500 at 3.40%
* $5,500 at 4.66%

Unsubsidized:

* $7,500 at 3.86%
* $6,500 at 6.80%
* $2,000 at 6.80%
* $2,000 at 4.66%

There is currently ~$2,300 in interest accumulated on the loans so far, growing every day. However, my parents have agreed to pay off the accumulated interest so far, before it is capitalized onto the principal amount, which happens when the grace period ends.

My question is basically which loans do I pay off first? Would it be best to pay off the subsidized loans first, before the grace period ends and they start accumulating interest? I could probably get pretty close to accomplishing this, as I will be living at home with the parents for the duration of the internship, so daily expenses are pretty low. Or should I go straight for the $6.5k at 6.8% loan since it accumulates the most interest? Where do I go from there after I pay off the first loan?

It seems insurmountable and I have anxiety attacks when I try to tackle the huge pile of paperwork and files and folders which I retrieved from my business manager. I have an accountant trying to help me with the IRS issue, but I feel like I need day-today help just to go through everything and organize it, and figure out what to do about it. It’s such a huge weight on my shoulders. I’m trying everything I can to keep my head up and just go through every day but this needs to be dealt with.  I live in a small town upstate where rent is cheaper, but jobs up here don’t pay as much as in the city, so I commute into Manhattan to work, about 2 hours one way, but that’s an added major expense. I used to work at a restaurant up here 5 days a week and made $300 a week. It’s not worth it with commuting costs etc. to commute into the city so I’ll be looking for a job up here again. 
Should I file bankruptcy? Bankruptcy will not do anything about the taxes owed. 
My accountant said that even if I work something out with the IRS to be on a payment plan, my income is so low that I wouldn’t be able to afford it. So I’m literally just riding it out day by day, living in fear. I haven’t filed taxes since 2012 because I’m so terrified.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Going back to school and have existing student loans - what is my best plan of attack?,"Hello!

I'm starting grad school this month, and will be keeping my current job while taking classes part time for the next two years. I have been planning on deferring my existing loans but paying cash as I go to avoid racking up additional debt. 

However, I just realized that the unsubsidized Stafford loans I'm being offered are a lower interest rate than many of my existing loans. Would I be better off taking the new loans, and putting the payments I would have been giving the school towards the higher interest loans I already have?

If it helps, here is my current debt load:
2.08% Stafford, $5809.58

5.8% Stafford, $4570.86

6.55% Stafford, $18056.97

6.8% Stafford, $1366.27

Variable 3.68% Private, $11175.64

personalfinance,[Planning] Save or Invest?,"Hey /r/personalfinance, I'm going to be receiving a rather substantial raise soon and wanted some advice. I've got two (and a half) ways that I'm considering using my money:

**1.** I can pay down student debt. I'm credit card debt free, and my debt interest rate is about 5%. I know this is the conventional wisdom.

**2.** Invest. I can either A. put additional funds into my 401(k) or B. Invest in an employee stock purchase plan. Both will limit the tax implications, while directly paying off student debt will not. It seems to me that if I can avoid paying income tax on the amount I put into investments, that this may pay off more in the long run than paying off debt. I'm not too concerned with liquidity, so having additional free cash when the debt is paid off is not a priority to me. Is investing the right option?

**Additional question:** I've maxed out my 401(k) match at work; should I invest more in the 401(k) or the employee stock purchase plan? The stock plan holds funds at no interest until the end of the quarter, at which point stock is purchased at a 5% discount from market value at close. The interest for such a short period doesn't seem to matter too much, especially with market interest rates now, when weighed against the discount. Any thoughts?",finance,1438706229

MachineLearning,Beginner questions regarding Recurrent Neural Networks and large scale learning.,"Hello

I am trying to do activity detection using accelerometer data but am somewhat of a novice when it comes to machine learning. I have a handful of questions and hopefully you guys can answer or point me in the direction of answers for me to read up on.

1) how do large companies do distributed machine learning? I have access to a large cluster of computers (running hadoop, but that's not necessarily important) and I want to know if I might be able to take advantage of them when I have a good amount of data. How do large companies train neural nets using large numbers of clustered computers? Is there a standard for it?

2) how do I go about formatting time series data so that it can be properly fed into the neural net? Should I break it up into chunks and feed some sort of magnitude of the chunk? Should I simply feed in each sample I get from my accelerometer? Is there a ""best"" or recommended way to feed in time series data? I want the data to be shift invariant bexuase it will be running continuously once the training is done.
Is there a recommended form for the data to take? I could feed in the time series, or a spectrogram of the frequency magnitudes, etc

3) what ""knobs"" should I know about to adjust the neural network? How do Recurrent Neural Networks differ from regular feed forward+backprop ANNs?

Sorry if these are a little broad, I am just getting my feet wet with Recurrent Neural Networks and its been some time since I took my machine learning class in college.

P.s. I am trying to do this in python right now, are there recommended neural network libraries for python? I know of scikitlearn but it doesn't seem to do neural networks. I am looking at theano right now but it seems overly complex for a beginner.",technology,1438709125

I'm using a throwaway name here. I'm currently a Staff Accountant with 2+ years of experience. I have a MAcc and I am eligible to sit for the CPA. I recently received a call from a local staffing agency, asking me if I'd be interested in a position they had. I was a little suspicious as I never contacted them before, didn't see them looking at my LinkedIn profile and they called from a fake extension (my caller ID at work was spoofed to show a fake internal extension calling). We spoke at length and I told him I might be interested. This new position would be a promotion and a significant increase in pay. I am not unhappy with my current job but I am trying to get my CPA before I start job hunting for a much better position. I was in this position about 2 months ago for a job that only paid slightly more than my current one, but the recruiter had lied about the pay, wasted my time and I ended up walking away after two interviews. Some questions:

1) Is this just a thinly veiled attempt to get my resume and add me to his stable of potential hires? Basically, was he just trolling for people and I happened to bite? Was the nice position just bait? He wanted me to come by for a 30 min interview and give him my resume (and probably sign a non-compete agreement). Should I bother? 

2) He did not want to name the company but he gave me enough information for me to figure it out. Would it be unethical or dumb to go around him and just apply to the company web site, where the job is posted? 

3) Should I just not waste my time and just get my CPA - my current job has become routine enough for me to spend a lot of time studying. Going to a new job would erase a lot of that.

personalfinance,Please help me (23F) come up with a plan for my debt?,"Hey, personalfinance!

I was wondering if any of you wonderful folks could help me come up with a plan to get out from under my (relative) mountain of debt. 

A bit of background: I dropped out of college in spring 2012 after completing 4 semesters. Most of my credits are in computer science, but I no longer have any interest in that career path. When I dropped out my GPA was crap thanks to mental health issues I was dealing with, which I just yesterday got diagnosed for (bipolar spectrum, yay...). Since I was 16 (23 now) I've worked a string of retail and tech support jobs, most of which were awful. I'm currently working my favorite job yet as a cashier in a family-owned place, but it's still not great and since I moved last month, it's an hour away from my house. They pay me well above minimum, though, so moving to another cashiering job close to home isn't an option. I always have my eyes open for other work, though, as I'd LOVE to get out of customer service.  Thanks to the mental health issues, I'm also horribly impulsive with money, though I am working on that now. 

This is what my finances look like currently:

Debt

- $22,500 in federal student loans
- $1,000 on credit card A (maxed out) - highest APR of all, though I don't remember exactly what. Around 20%
- $527 on credit card B (maxed out) - also high APR
- $140 on Kohl's card
- $1,500 interest free debt to my mother after she helped me out of a jam last year

Monthly Expenses

- $67 for car insurance
- ~$170 for gas
- ~$100 for food &amp; pet care
- ~$80 for mental health treatment (estimated since a lot of those bills haven't started yet)
- $400 towards mortgage/electric/cable/water/trash - My SO and I own our house and since he makes far more than I do, this what he calculated as a fair portion for me to pay relative to my income. I'm pretty sure he's going easy on me &amp; on months where I can't pay the full amount, he just takes what I can
- $75 to pay the $25 minimum on both CC and the Kohl's card 
- $100 towards the debt to my mom

Income

$10/hr for about 25hr a week. Ends up being about $850/month after taxes. 
According to my boss, I'll be going to $11/hr and a full 40hr/week starting in September or October when he moves me to full time, but he's made similar promises before. This is the first time he's given me hard numbers, so I'm hopeful, but still skeptical. This would also raise my gas bill as I'd be commuting an extra 2 hours a week. 
I also sell a little on eBay to help make up the difference, but it's hit or miss. 

Other notes

- I own my SUV outright, but since it's 15 years old and has ~100k miles on it, it's getting less reliable &amp; costing more in repairs. I need to start budgeting for a replacement, as I expect it to die on me sometime in the next few years
- I live in Carroll County, MD if anyone local has some job suggestions! (I like working with plants or animals, though I have very minimal experience in either field &amp; no good references in those area. Plant nursery job was 6 years ago and the dog kennel was for an insane boss)
- While I'd be open to doing some work from home on the side, I'd rather change jobs than pick up a second job. Thanks to the super fun mental health issues, I have to be careful with my work/life balance and the last time I worked two jobs it had some nasty consequences. I'm much more stable at ~40hr/week. Sorry if that sounds like a cop-out :(

personalfinance,Can I use one student loan to pay for another?,"Forgive the long post - skip to the last paragraph for the gist.

I have been in and out of college since 2008. I have managed to rack up $35k or so in student loans over that period, and am going back to school this semester. Once in school, all loans will go into deferment so I won't be required to make payments, and the subsidized (and I believe Perkins) loans will stop collecting interest. My times out of school have been short enough that the Perkins loan never went into payment or started collecting interest, so I'm assuming that will still be the case. Here's where I sit right now:

Non-subsidized Stafford loans

* $16,104.02 at 6.8% interest

Subsidized Stafford loans

* $3,350.02 at 6.0% interest (will go to 0% next month)

* $1,073.57 at 5.6% interest (will go to 0% next month)

* $10,686.86 at 3.4% interest (will go to 0% next month)

Perkins loan

* $1,400.00 at 5% interest (has yet to kick in)

I've paid off one unsubsidized loan and have almost paid off a second one (avalanche method, trying to knock out those 6.8% bastards). When I'm in school, I won't be required to make payments on any loans, but I'll still throw a good chunk of each paycheck at the unsubsidized loans which are still collecting interest.

I am now a full-time employee of my university. All full time employees get their tuition paid for by the university. I applied for federal financial aid anyway to see what would happen, and was awarded a $5500 subsidized loan at 6.8% and a $7500 unsubsidized loan at 6.8%. I see no reason to accept the unsubsidized loan since it'd just be another loan that collects interest at the highest rate while I'm in school. The subsidized loan though would not be collecting interest while I'm in school. Since my tuition is paid for, if I accepted this loan would I just get a check for $5500? I've never received a loan that exceeded my tuition so I'm not sure how that works. If that is how it works, could I then use that loan to pay off a third of my unsubsidized loans? I would in effect be converting $5500 of interest-collecting debt into $5500 of non-interest-collecting debt (which would begin collecting interest at the same 6.8% once I am out of school).

We contribute about 6% of his income to a 401k and the maximum into our Roth IRAs. We have $70,000 in a savings account for our home purchase. We are comfortable using $40,000 of this for a down payment. Our credit scores are 757 and 790.

We do have some student loan and car debt. Total payment for this is about $1100/month. We can certainly pay off some of the debt with our savings (but we just sold our previous house and thought we would save until after we have another house).

We were suppose to get about $4,000 in tax rebates but got about half because my wife and I maxed out our tax credits through student loans, mortgage, etc. We put $5,000 down and got a 3.9 percent interest rate for 84 months. 

Cut to two years later, we find out the resell value is $13,000! We were understandably pissed. Ford basically dumped this car on the market, didn't promote it and thus there's no demand for it. We do save on gas (48 mpg) but if you throw in the increase on our electric bill (about $20), the savings are negligible.

While shopping for a second car, the salesman entertained the idea of trading in the C-Max and getting a Subaru Forester, adding the difference we owe into the new car loan. The dealership is offering to buy the C-Max at $13,200. We still owe $25,000. The offer is a Forester for ~$29,000 with $6,000 down. With that and the difference on the C-Max, $523 for 72 months at a .9 percent rate. 

Other point is we have already logged 48,000 miles on the C-Max so we'd be getting rid of a high mileage car that we still owe $25,000 on. 

Yes, I know we got hosed on the C-Max but does this new deal make sense? We can afford the slight increase in payments. Let me know if you need additional information.

I have signed a contract with my company stating I will pay $750 a month for rent.

I am paid bi-weekly (every 2 weeks). From each paycheck, I am deducted $375 in rent, which all makes sense to me.

What confuses me is that I am given an extra $375 per month as a 'housing offset' before taxes, then deducted $750 after taxes for rent. Although, in the end, I am still paying around $375 for rent, I feel I'm getting duped out of money due to being taxed a higher amount before taxes.

Here is an example of a paycheck:

+ $1,000 bi-weekly salary
+ $375 housing offset

social security, federal tax, and state tax are taken from the above total

- $375 housing offset
- $375 rent

We are not homeowners, nor do we have children (yet).  We are both educated people (read: student loans), however we would like to move from the state we currently reside in to another state 1,000 miles away for a lifestyle change/more occupational opportunities.

My wife and I have discussed the move since the beginnings of our relationship, and if I were to be honest, it seemed to be a bit of a pipe dream...until now.  We want to make sure that we are making the right move with this life-changing amount of money.  We discussed using the funds to start our homestead in the new state.  We are currently exploring the housing market in the new area, and have several realtors sending us listings that we are perusing daily.  This coming weekend, we will be flying to meet with one of the realtors for some showings.  We are looking in the ballpark of paying $200,000 cash for a home, so that we have some liquidity left over for incidentals and investments.

We have not secured jobs in the area we are looking to move as of yet, however there are regularly FAR more opportunities for the both of us (hence the motivation toward the move).  We have researched prospective positions ad nauseam.  It just isn't very feasible to secure the careers/positions without being there.  We found that being out of state hinders the hiring process to a degree.

So I suppose my/our question is; what say all of you?  I know some may suggest it would be advisable to pay down our student loan debt (our interest rates are not too terrible, however collectively, they are at ~$100k).  Other then that, we have no financial obligations (no credit debt, no car payments) other than survival.  I know that we will not receive the same tax incentives if we were to finance/mortgage, so that is something we are researching.  My wife's credit is not so great, mine is presumably adequate enough to secure a small mortgage on my own.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1438725744
personalfinance,At what % interest is it smarter to invest instead of aggressively eliminate debt?,"My loans are a mix between subsidized and unsubsidized, and initially ranged in interest from 3.15% - 6.55%. I've been paying them down the highest first as fast as possible ($9000 in my first 7 months out of college!), but I'm wondering at what point it makes more sense to start investing my money elsewhere instead of emptying it all into loans?

Since my interest rate decreases on a sliding scale as I pay off my highest loans, at some point it will make more sense for me to invest instead of pay beyond the minimum for my loans, right? I'm currently at an average of 3.87% interest on $19,000, and can decrease that to ~3.5% within 2 months, but then it won't go down by much until it's mostly gone.

I'm wondering if there is some generally accepted % where it's best to just pay the minimum, or if there's some formula for calculating it.",finance,1438726056

I currently claim a 2 for withholding on my federal taxes (1 on state).  I have no dependents, but claiming a 2 offsets the money I get back from the tax break for paying student loan interest, so keeps my total return close to zero (~100).

personalfinance,"UK PF, advice regarding current account and transferring graduate account OD.","Hi all. I'm a 23 year old Nursing graduate. I am employed full time in London. 

I moved here for my graduate job with not a penny to my name, £2k into my Co Op student overdraft (maxed out). I took out an interest free Tesco credit card and lived off of it for a month, amassing about £2.4k in debt (flat deposit, union membership, NMC membership, as well as not wanting to miss out on the first month of having a social life all year). 

Today (10 months later) I paid that credit card off in full and closed the account. I also opened another credit card account. I'm still £1.5k into my ""graduate"" overdraft which as of the 1st of this month turned into a current account with an agreed overdraft paying 18.9% interest for what I am currently in. My plan is to transfer this debt over to my new Halifax credit card (0% on balance transfers, 0% balance transfer fee, 0% on purchases for 18 months) and pay it off at £250-£300 a month.

I also plan on opening a new current account with a more sensible overdraft, I think I saw Santander do a current account with a 0% interest rate on a £250 overdraft which is exactly what I want. I want to try to be out of debt by New Year. 

I'm also about to change jobs, moving out of central London and into the community at home. I will need to take out a personal loan soon in order to buy myself a car. Has anyone got any advice about how to get a loan and what I should do about switching current accounts? As I know from previously I needed to have a Co Op account for a year before I could take out a loan with them. So maybe I shouldn't close my current account at the Co Op?

personalfinance,I'm worth more than negative dollars! Net worth trend for the first 2 years post graduation.,"Hi folks,

Just wanted to share this to brag a bit (I am proud) and provide some inspiration for anyone in debt. I graduated college a couple years ago with a hefty student loan bill around $60k. Since that time, I have been employed full time and paying them off as quick as I can and saving some along the way. [I finally went over $0 Net Worth in June of 2015.] (http://i.imgur.com/Q1gC5Ox.png)

What I've done:

* Put 7% per paycheck in 401k with 50% company match
* Started a Roth IRA with $200 per month auto-contribution (Vanguard)
* Started an emergency fund with 3 months expenses
* Put as much extra money as I can into the highest interest loans
* Refinanced the remaining loans around 6.5% with SoFi to 3.5% variable interest rate once they would approve me, I plan to pay off within a year
* Tried to live a frugal life while still spending moderately on the things I enjoy most, food and travel.

Sure there are things I can and should do better (max out 401(k) and Roth), spend less on food, and other ways. I am happy with my progress so far and the direction I am headed. Obviously what you can accomplish depends on income, but if you set a reasonable financial goal and work toward it you will be rewarded.

Apologies if already posted - on mobile. Have heard good things about yall. Maybe yall can help a newb in need of advice. 

So, I'll jump right to it. I have multiple accounts at the moment. A ""bills"" account with checks, which is used for bills. A savings (with weekly deposits of $25 - not much but trying to save). And a ""fun money"" account through simple for spending/short term savings. 

I apparently left an autopay for my car payment turned on in my main bills account and it is posting as we speak. I had already paid the bill manually and didn't get any sort of reminder this autopay was happening until this evening when according to the bank it was ""too late to cancel"" and it will take them 45-90 days to refund the money. The issue is: rent will be paid this week out of my bills account and I hate to pull so much out of savings to be waiting in limbo to be repaid. Should I a) pull out money from my savings to pay for expenses and bills and keep paying extra on bills due (such as loans and credit cards) or b) reduce payment on my credit cards (from $100 over minimum balance to just minimum) for the next few months and put things as needed on them to be repaid in 45-90 days? Aiming to make the best situation happen in this rock and hard place scenario. Hope this makes some sense. It's late and I'm tired and slightly frustrated at myself. :/


TLDR: autopay error. Not enough in account. Pull from savings or pay less on bills to balance until money is refunded to account in 2-3 months?

investing,Buy Gold in August,"With the gold price still reeling from the underwhelming China gold reserve update, some may be forgiven for giving up on the yellow metal. 

However the logical conclusion of Chinese authorities not being ready to disclose their full reserves and sticking to the 1.658 tonne number is that they are still buyers, with no interest in pumping the price until they reach their target allocation. It is also interesting that they are dumping Treasuries at a dangerous rate.

Even in the current correction, a downtrend that has lasted since 2011, gold seasonality has been extremely positive from August to February. Buying gold before the end of summer and selling before spring has been a winning trade in 2011, 2012 and 2013, all negative years for gold. In 2014 this trade broke even. Needless to say in the previous years 2005-2010 it did even better.

I would argue, as Jim Rogers and Jim Rickards do, that the current correction is almost over with $980-1000 as an almost optimal entry point before the resumption of the decade-long uptrend. A 40-50% retracement is natural after 500% gains.

Negative interest rates and completely unprecedented monetary policies from the world's major central banks are, in the long term, extremely bullish for gold.

personalfinance,Rewards Credit Cards? Thoughts and Gotchas?,"So here's my current situation:

About $6k in credit card debt.  About to sell my motorcycle because of an accident and I have 2 kids under 2 years old, so I'm not exactly looking to leave them high and dry without their breadwinner.  Using the money from the Motorcycle to pay off the Credit Card debt.  Will come out ahead on this, as the bike is easily worth over what I have in debt, but not by too much.

I'm thinking about getting one of those Disney rewards cards.  I'm planning (if I do it) to use it for just about everything that's a regular expense (groceries, gas, utilities, etc) and paying it off immediately instead of direct debiting on my account like I do now for all of these bills.

We're also planning a kitchen remodel within the next few years, as well as we're planning on getting married in a year or so.  Most of the wedding money will be coming from her father who has cash on hand.  She also doesn't have any outstanding debt (~1k in Lowes Credit card) and we've worked very hard to get there for her.

I'm planning on putting both the Wedding and the kitchen remodel on that card if possible for the rewards points.  (And Obviously paying it right back off before I leave the place where I payed, ain't nobody got time for 22% interest.)

I'm also not planning on going to Disney for at least another 8 years.  I want both the kids to be old enough to enjoy AND remember it, as we're probably going to be going there once because screw paying all that money again.

So my real question here is that I want to know if it's worth all the extra effort to do something like this.  Is there anything to watch out for with these types of credit cards that will sneak up on you? (Other than the obvious, applicable to every credit card ever stuff like super high interest rates) that isn't exactly layed out very clearly?

personalfinance,[Request] Looking for tips/tricks for non-salaried (hourly) employees.,"I have a buddy that is having some difficulty transitioning from a salaried job into an hourly manufacturing position. I have referred him to this sub regarding 401k and budgeting advice, but he is getting a little tripped up when it comes to having to work overtime and cover other shifts, sometimes as much as 6 hours earlier or later than his normal time (high turnover at his company and understaffed). 

The first and foremost tip that I laid out for him, having worked kinda the same deal as him for the last six years, is to budget only for 40 hours a week. Too many guys I work with get 12 hour shifts for a couple months and just assume it is going to last forever. You see the new cars start parking outside, and then it slows down again, and the cars have to go.

Another thing is lifestyle creep, which is also tied in with the above point, but unlike a big raise at a salaried position, salary creep tends to happen instantaneously and unexpectedly. You work 40 hours normally, but 70 the next week, you want to treat yourself, take the kids out because you haven't seen them all week, and suddenly that extra 30 hours of OT just became 0 over the course of two days. 

It is a lot for him to handle right now, he was laid off awhile ago and this was all he could find. Along with the feeling of having to take a step back, harder working conditions, etc. he's not had the easiest time making this transition. I understand most of the PFers here are on some sort of salary, but if there are any hourly workers here that could chime in, I would really appreciate any extra advice I could give him.

Parents have passed leaving their house.  No mortgage, liens, or any other outstanding obligations on it.  So, free and clear.

Three siblings (one older and one younger besides myself).  The younger has lived and will continue to live in the house.

My original plan was to just transfer the ownership to the younger and eventually when that person moves, sell the house and split the money.  I did not think there was any rush.  I was wrong.

The oldest sib is making it apparent they want their share of the estate now which that person is certainly entitled to regardless of any past discussions.

My initial thought was continue with the transfer of ownership and have the youngest get a loan to ""buy out"" the oldest's interest (I can wait until the house sells sometime in the future for my share).  I think this is probably the best path but I am open to suggestions.

With that, I was considering a home equity loan to finance it but I now begin to realize that a standard mortgage would probably make more sense considering both have the closing costs and a traditional mortgage usually comes with a better interest rate.

A couple additional questions / curiosities I had:

If I were to decide to take ownership and get the loan myself, would me living in another state make that impossibly complicated?

and

is it normal to take a mortgage for much less than the value of the property such as I would be doing in this case?

(if it matters from a financing perspective, we're both fine, scores are sitting around 800)

personalfinance,Should I be making extra principle payments on my mortgage?,"Hey PF, just to give some background, I make ~60k a year, have a 401k that I contribute 10% of my weekly paycheck to, (company matches a percentage).

I bought a house last year with conventional financing, put down just over 5% on the 135k home. I have been making $100 principle payments on top of my monthly payments in addition to injecting a big chunk of my tax return into it. 

But should I be doing this? I'm asking because this is a starter home for me, (I'm 24) and I don't plan on living in this house past 30. I lucked out with the area I bought in and the house has shot up in value, if I wanted to sell, I could get about 170k. So, Instead of putting that extra $100 in a savings account each month, I figured investing it in my home would be a better investment as the interest rates on savings accounts right now is terrible. However, my coworker who also bought their house around the same time as me isn't making any principle payments, she is in the same boat as me, doesn't want to live in that home past 30 so she doesn't see the point in making extra principle payments (granted the area she lives in wasn't as fortunate as my neighborhood, her home value hasn't changed.

personalfinance,Refi for equity to pay off debt?,"Something came up and I now have a need to move from SC to MI, but I own a home here.  Because of some bad  timing and lack of follow-through from the BRAC, the housing market in my area never really recovered from the last crash.  I'm worried I won't be able to sell my house (just in my neighborhood there are several houses that have sat vacant for 3-5 years...) so I'm considering renting it out through a property manager.  If this is the case, I'm also considering refinancing it to make it profitable.  I should have refinanced years ago when the rates were rock-bottom but, at that time, I didn't have plans to stay there that much longer and didn't thing it would be worth the costs.  Hindsight, and all that...

When I bought my home in 2005 I got a 6% rate which, at that time, was good.  Now they're, what, 3.75%?

But that's not what I'm here for.  I'm here seeking advice because I also have $22k credit card debt and, now, an $8k vehicle loan that fell back on me.  The card is 6%, the auto is 3.29%.

Last night I got to thinking about refinancing for (I need to call for the exact balance, but I think my mortgage is around $80k now, so $100k'ish) to pull out $20k in equity and pay down the debt.  I'll have to crunch the numbers to see if it's even feasible for me, but I wanted to get perspective about whether it would be wise to do this, or not.  Using equity would put it at a lower interest rate, but for a longer duration.  I don't know if I could afford to shorten the loan to 20 years with the additional principle, or if I'd have to stretch it back out to 30 years; that's something else I'll have to crunch.   Paying debt with debt... is there a time and place for it?  Is this one?

Some more stats to consider:
My salary (have been a single income household for 15 years; most of that debt is a culmination of unexpected expenses over those 15 years): $40,000 (bring home $1225 x 24)
Mortage: $755/mo (with escrow)​
Card: $350/mo
Auto: $150/mo

And then other expenses:
Groceries: $400/mo (essentials only, no treats/extras, but does include dog food)
Fuel: $300/mo (I live 55 miles from my job, which is why I didn't think I'd stay in that house this long)
Electric: $120/mo (varies, but this is the average)
Emergency fun: $100/mo (once I get this to $1k, I'll reallocate these funds to debt)
Auto Ins: $75/mo (for both vehicles; my truck is paid off)
Internet: $55/mo (just 'Net, no cable)
Gym: $50/mo (I'm locked into a contract until Dec)
Water: $40/mo
Phone: $35/mo

I currently have 2 credit cards, one with ~$8,000 on it @ ~22% and the other with ~$4,000 on it @ ~24%.

I don't believe if I take the funds out it will push me into the (2015) 25% tax bracket, and even if it does, it'll be just barely.

If I take money out of the 401k, there will be a 10% penalty, but I am paying 23% between the two cards and I feel like it may help to at least wipe out these cards that I would be able to have a net gain at the end of the day.

I understand the principle of compounding interest, and I understand the benefit of having the 401k pre-tax, but I am having trouble applying it to my situation.  It seems that if I am currently having less than a 13% (23% card - 10% penalty) ROI on my 401k, paying off the cards will be the better option.

So, should I take out $17,143 ($12k/70%[100% - 10% penalty - 20% W/H]) to payoff my $12,000 of CC debt @ 23% interest rate, or should I keep the 17k in the 401k and just slowly chip away at the CC debt over the next 3-4 years?

When I got my house I was making somewhere around $42,000 per year. I put down 4% since I was a first time home buyer, and am at a 3.75% interest rate. Since getting my new job I have made it my goal to pay off my house ASAP. Right now I am looking at a 4 year plan to have it paid off in full and then have a little bit extra. 

I want to rent out my house when I am done paying it off, and right now rental estimates for my house are $1,050. I think $1,200 in 4 years is a reasonable expectation with how the housing market is going, plus I am putting value into my home with things like a water softener, insulating blinds, a washer/dryer that wasn't there before, and other random small things.

Here's the deal. I want to buy a different house to live in when I go forward with renting out this current house, and given that I make good money and will have another source of income, I feel like I should be able to get a pretty nice place. Problem is, with my current plan I would have to once again put down 4% instead of the recommended 20% if I want a house around $400,000. If I were to use the money I have left over after my 4 year plan as a 20% down payment, I would only get a place for $130,000, which would basically mean I'd be living next door to my current place. That doesn't seem to make sense for me and where I anticipate my life unfolding. My current location is nice, but it's in a small town and a half hour from anything worth going to, including work. 

My justification for putting 4% down on my current house was that I felt it was a good time to buy (2013, turned out I was right :D ) and it's hard to save for a 20% down payment when making so little. I definitely understood it was high risk, but it made sense to take that risk since I saw housing getting more and more expensive anyway.

Every check i earned went straight to the bar and paid off my car insurance / cell phone, still lived at home so i never had to worry about rent, and i brought pizza home mostly every night so i wasnt bumming food. Tried to get into the construction with my bosses they knew i was a hard worker but it was family ran and owned so i was never offered a job.

Ended up breaking it off with the girlfriend and at the same time my monte carlo ended up taking a shit on me, no money to my name and now having no ride to work I was SOL.  Waited 2 weeks at work picking up as many hours as i could i took my next check to the car dealership. Spotted the car i wanted 2010 dodge avenger ( a nice little car, what i thought would be good on gas mileage) Put 700$ down and ended up getting the loan for 6 years with an interest rate of 16.9% no cosigner nothing not very sure how i pulled it off and now thinking about it im sure they thought it was going to get repossessed too.

Working towers was tough i was scared to death, i didnt trust anyone. They all smoked pot to from and on the towers so if something happened it was going to be a bad day.

Hoping to get some advice on how to help my cousin out. He's had quite a rough upbringing (father was never really there, and mother had drug/health issues). As a consequence, he had to rely on his own hustle to support himself. In addition to a number of other significant financial blunders (maxing out and defaulting on credit cards, getting locked into a car loan he couldn't really afford with a 17% interest rate, etc.), I've come to learn that he's never filed a federal tax return since turning becoming an adult 12 years ago. I am doing whatever I can help him get back on the right track so he can start to live with a bit less stress, but I'm not entirely sure where to start with this one.

Over the last decade or so, he's supported himself primarily by buying and selling used video games. He has also had sporadic employment, both above and under the table, at places like restaurants and liquor stores, but has never really held those jobs for more than a few months at a time. I'm sure he's gotten a small handful of W-2's over the years, but pretty much ignored them since he didn't really know what to do with them. 

He buys his video game inventory in private party transactions via Craigslist, local flea markets, and yard sales and such. He does most of his day-to-day selling through Amazon / eBay storefronts, but does a fair amount of cash transactions through private parties and at video game conventions as well. 

Surprisingly, (to our knowledge) he has never been contacted by the IRS for failure to file. My suspicion is that his income has been so low (almost certainly couldn't be more than $25K or so in any given year) that he most likely would have actually been entitled to refunds had he been filing this whole time.

I understand the statutes of limitation regarding how far back you can ask for unclaimed refunds and how far back the IRS can go to try and collect unpaid taxes that they are owed; however, because of a near-complete lack of record-keeping, I feel like it's impossible to determine what he's made and what he potentially would have owed (or been owed), especially in those earlier years. Thankfully, the money he's making in his online storefronts can be tracked a bit better, which might make his life easier going forward, but trying to rebuild history will prove to be near-impossible.

I spoke with a friend of mine who is an Enrolled Agent with the IRS and she recommended visiting a local IRS field office to see what they might be able to do. I know that tax evasion is a serious crime, but I highly doubt they would throw him in cuffs for coming forward seeking help. While I think a visit to the IRS office is definitely solid advice and something that I plan to pursue with him, I just wanted to see if any of you might have additional suggestions or advice.

personalfinance,Looking to refi ~$74k of private student loans... Any advice would be helpful!,"Hi PF,

Could use some of your wisdom and advice on my student loan situation...

Background:
So I am 26 and work at a decent paying job making ~$70k/year. I went to a public school for college (graduated in 2011) but had no help from my parents financially and was going out of state so I took out 4 different private student loans (one each year of school) that are now really starting to take a toll on my finances. These loans were all with Chase but were recently transitioned to AES. I have excellent credit (780 range) and no other debt besides these loans. I have a small government loan but I am not worried about that one. Apparently, federal loans can't be refinanced anyways.

I want to get a better monthly payment and lower all my interest rates. I am looking around and SoFi seems to be the best option for me but I was hoping for some second opinions. Should I get a fixed or variable interest rate? Should I refi all 4 loans or just the largest one? SoFi can get me a better interest rate (variable or fixed) than my lowest interest rate right now. 

Here is the breakdown of what I owe (all rounded):
Current principal balance: $74,247

Loan 1: Current balance $28,249 w/variable interest rate of 5.75%
Loan 2: Current balance $20,705 w/variable interest rate of 12.04% (YES that is correct and this is the one I am most worried about taking care of!)

Loan 3: Current balance $15,388 w/variable interest rate of 6.89%
Loan 4: Current balance of $9850 w/variable interest rate of 7.54%

I started paying these off as soon as I graduated and I feel like after 4 years I should have made more of a dent in my loans. The original total was somewhere around $80k. I have been throwing extra money each month (~200/mo) at the 12% interest loan because I feel like that is the killer and the others are fairly manageable. I spend $700 a month on these loans and another $150 for the federal loan. 

I checked out a few different refi lenders and SoFi seems to have the best rates with some preliminary figures of 5.9-6.9% fixed and 4.1-4.8% variable. This also depends on how long I want to pay them off. 

Questions:

-Long-term, would a variable or fixed rate be the better option? The cap on the variable is 8.9% so I don't feel like that is too terrible if I started at 4.1-4.4%

-Has anyone had any experience (good or bad) with SoFi?

-Any other lenders I should look into?

-Should I refi all 4 loans or just the highest one? They are going to do a hard credit pull when I decide to move forward and don't want to ding up my good credit by doing this 4 times...

I am leaning towards a 15 year ~4.4% variable rate where my monthly payment would be lower (~$500/mo) and I would try to still pay about $200 extra each month to get it paid down faster. The 10 year plan is a little too high of a monthly payment to be stuck with ($755/mo preliminary estimate) so the hope is to pay off the refinanced loan in less than 15 years. Right now, with my current situation, I am looking at paying the full balance off 17-18 years from now. $850 a month on student loans is quite expensive and I want to spend less if possible or at least pay it off sooner!

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!",finance,1438813908

personalfinance,Student Loans: Grace ends in November. Tips?,"Good Evening!
As of May my other half graduated from college and we are trying to create a plan of attack for her loans. I haven't had any experience with student loans and figured /r/personalfinance would be able to help.

As she stands now, there are 4 loans.
Group A: Subsidized
Interest rate: 6.8
Accrued interest: 54.47
Current Principal: 4719.24
First payment upcoming in December: 76.09

Group B: Unsubsidized
Interest rate: 6.8
Accrued interest: 1413.51
Current Principal: 16,009.51
First payment upcoming in December: 214.51

Group D: Unsubsidized
Interest rate: 3.860
Accrued interest: 387.06
Current Principal: 5744
First payment upcoming in December: 62.32

Group E: Unsubsidized
Interest rate: 4.66
Accrued interest: 120.17
Current Principal: 3648.17
First payment upcoming in December: 50

Term length: 120 months. 

First of all, as of right now her balance is $30,562. It looks like the first payment will be roughly $402. Based on some online calculations, I found the estimated interest to be about 10k. If we pay $402 for 120 months this is 48k total. Can you do that type of calculation, or will the payment decrease in the end for student loans?(It should remain on standard repayment).

The second question gets down into the nitty gritty. What would be our best plan of approach between now and capitalization in November? She had been applying all of her money onto group A, because it has one of the higher interest rates but a lower amount to get rid of quickly.
My idea was to use her cash between now and November and get rid of the accrued interest on each loan. Will this be any more beneficial than if she continued to make principal payments on group A? I am honestly not familiar enough with this stuff to make more than a guess. 

Tying onto that question, should we continue with the same approach that is suggested(whatever that might be...we shall see) after November and throughout the loan period? I will obviously shoot to pay off the loans in about 50-75% of the time frame. 

Regardless, I look forward to your tips, suggestions and opinions! Thank you so much",finance,1438820983
personalfinance,Help me invest my inheritance windfall! (Canada),"Hello, I recently found out I am about to inherit around $160,000 CDN. I have about $60,000 in debt, 5000 being in credit, the rest in debt to my parents, against their homeowners line of credit. The reason for that is that I have been unemployed for the last 5 years due to a spinal cord injury and nerve damage.

Obviously the first thing I should do is pay off any high interest debts like the credit card, but how should I go about investing the rest? Is there enough available that I might be able to pay of a large chunk of the 60k owed, then use dividends from the money I invest to pay of the rest to my parents over time? Is it better to just pay off all of it at once, then invest the rest?

I just asked what the interest on the Homeowners line of credit is. Apparently its around 2% per annum.

Lastly, I'm considering starting a small business. I just feel incredibly overwhelmed, and I''m scared to spend even a drop of it on something. I'll probably never have this much cash in one lump again, I want to help make my life better with it. 

For the record, I'm a 29 year old male. my spinal cord injury is disc herniation with fairly severe nerve damage, I also separated my sacral-ilial joint, causing a lot of scar tissue. I can't work right now, five years on, and I'm not sure how to keep my life together once my workers comp runs out. I'd be sad if I had to whittle away the money over the next few years to keep me housed and fed.

EDIT - The interest on the homeowners credit is 2% per annum, adjusted and charged on a monthly basis.

personalfinance,Moving to Shanghai for a job -- need advice on student loans and retirement,"Hi r/PF,

I have been obsessing over this for days and I have talked to so many people and heard so many things it's hard to just exist right now. 

So, here's the story: I will graduate in the spring with a Master's in Education at the age of 25 and I will have around 13k in student debt if all goes well (i.e. I don't have to take out some loans to pay for rent) and I am applying to and basically have a job teaching at an international school in Shanghai (a proper K-12 one, not a language one) making around 3100 dollars a month for 10 months with a 6,500 dollar bonus at the end of the year for completing my contract. I will not have to pay rent, bills or utilities at all. If I really applied myself, I could pay off my student loans in a year.

My concern is that apparently I cannot contribute to an IRA as I had assume for as long as I can remember because it is foreign earned money. Apparently there might be a way of using the Foreign Tax credit to do this, but I have no idea and I have called Vanguard and Schwab asking about this and no one seems to have any idea.

So I realize that I am losing on prime investing years for the IRA and I am stressing very much about that. I can still invest in stocks and mutual funds at Vanguard and pay down my student loans (I won't have to pay US taxes so this will help I think). 

I only plan on being in Shanghai for a little while -- 1 to 3 years depending -- and then I will come back to the states. Is the best plan of action then to just invest in mutual funds (which apparently Fidelity has recently banned overseas clients from doing? Which worries me about Vanguard) and pay down my 13k student loans that have an interest rate of 6.21% and worry about a 401k and a Roth when I come back to teach? Is there anything else I can do to plan for the future?

If anyone has any experience being a teacher overseas and the financial planning involved in this I would appreciate the help. Do I have all my facts right? Money stresses me out so much and all of this is rather overwhelming. 

I love teaching and traveling, and I thought going to Shanghai would also be a good financial move, but part of me is making me second guess my options to stay home and save.

I'd appreciate a sanity check on my plan to deal with these funds, but first, important stats:  32, in a live-in 6 year LTR.  I make 60k, he makes 80k.

* -2- My 8-10 year old student loans are out of control. 30.5k at 6.55%, 36k at 4.4-4.8%, and 2k at 2%.  I'd like to use 30.5k to knock out the loans at 6.55% and then refinance the 36k to a lower %.

* -3- Buy a nice sleeper sofa so my parents can visit me, 2k.  Grampa dying has kind of lit a fire under my fanny to make sure I can see them, even if they don't have the money for expensive hotel stays in San Francisco- it can be $200/night.  Two to three typical trips ""pays for"" the couch.

So, that's about 35.5k so far.

* -4- Add to our emergency fund with the remainder.  We have about 5k right now (which I could have used to pay off the credit card debt, but I feel like we need the EF). So, EF would be somewhere around 25-35k.

* -5- If things turn out more optimistically, I'd like to get rid of some of my smaller loans.  Here, my question is: because I have something like 10 loans to choose from, do I pick two small loans to pay off so I have 8 loans left, or do I pay off some of a larger loan and keep 10 loans on my credit report?

In over my head and would seriously appreciate some help. This is a longish post but I would like to give all detail rather than have people ask the list of follow up questions.


Had just under 800 credit score for 20 years. I know how it works and have never had problems before. I DO live within my means so please do not make assumptions about my degree of responsibility. This is an honest to goodness, quite literal case of a series of bad luck leading to catastrophic financial difficulty.


My situation was stable and due to longtime career experience and contacts was able to start a business. The business was sustainable and thriving up until recently. I am a textbook case of the economy going south and taking me for the ride. My business is a niche market so for privacy issues would rather keep that to myself. This industry has a natural ebb and flow so it is HIGHLY likely that my fortunes will turn in the next 6 months.


I have cut everything extra down to a minimum and canceled luxuries such as gym memberships, satellite tv etc. We have cut back all expenses and are following a budget as best as we can given the underwater status we are in. Are looking for 2nd jobs, will try to sell anything of value.


My debt currently greatly exceeds my income.


Take home from outside employment $2800 month, business was the main bread winner.


Bare bones expenses each month including gas, insurance, basic grocery staples (generic and home cooked), utilities etc are around $1400.


Mortgage  $640 month, minimal equity, financed at good interest rate so a refi not helpful


Just got annual property tax bill of $2000, after all the stress forgot it was coming.


Vehicles $16,000 total or $400 month. Upside down in one vehicle due to a poorly thought out trade in a couple years ago (when life was better). Due to our area transportation options and work, neither car can be parted with.


Tuition for kids school $600 a month, special needs issues, non-negotiable expense. Would starve before dropping this one.


Credit card debts  total about $50k and all combined are $1200 monthly. 12% interest so not much wiggle room for a settlement situation. 


Please spare me the lecture, a lot of this was business related expenses and was comfortably within my means before business abruptly slowed. EVERYONE in the industry is suffering and laying off. 


Paying interest on a $40k operating line of credit. Again, this was not an irresponsible amount based on business type. This note is secured with equipment that we must keep to run the business. If we default we lose everything, including the opportunity to fulfill tentative order agreements for the coming industry changes.


A net 30 business expense just came in for $1500. Another case of stress amnesia.


Business space is $400 month. Giving it up will torpedo our reputation.


Went from a business running on cash basis and annual household income (after business costs) of $125,000-ish to less than half that in the matter of a couple weeks.


I contacted my creditors in good faith to try to sort out the issues. I am too over extended and lack collateral to get funds and can’t pay now anyway. I tried to make arrangements/settlement but here is the hysterical irony…they can’t help me because, get this…my payments have not been late and are not overdue. They can’t offer me any special programs because I HAVE been responsible. Not eligible?!?


*Bangs head on wall*


The only obvious option I see is throwing my hands in the air, take a major hit with bankruptcy and lose everything including my business. It’s better than getting run over by a dump truck but not by much.


However, if I can “get by” for 6 months or so (no idea how) my business has some long standing situations that are going to come to fruition. This isn’t wishful thinking. Part of the business debt was developing a unique product that has gained a lot of interest and chatter but is in its final beta testing. It's an industry exclusive and patent pending. I’m so close I can taste it and yet so damn far away.


If the business (s-corp) goes under I lose any chance of a recovery or ability to prevent long term damage. The temporary situation becomes permanent.


Should I look for a building to jump off of (kidding) or is there a glimmer of hope that I missed?

- i graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in a few years ago. i have been making $270/month payments to Great Lakes, but these loans will now enter deferment once i go back to school

- these loans were in forbearance for about a year before i started to pay them back - i have never missed a loan payment since then, but now i am worried what little credit i built up will be ruined

- in an effort to reduce more debt from this second degree, i signed up for a tuition payment plan at nursing school where i pay 10% down immediately (about $280) and then 4 monthly payments ($580/month) for the rest of the semester (i made the payment for August today)

- unfortunately since i already have a degree, the overwhelming majority of scholarships and federal loans are not available to me, and i am trying to avoid taking out a private loan for this second degree

- i have been pushing myself at work to work 6 days instead of 5, and staying late/coming in early whenever possible. instead of 38 hours a week, i am working closer to 46-50 hours a week.

- my paychecks from work are biweekly

- in October, i am up for a raise (max is 5% of current wage, so possibly $13.65/hour at best)

- other bills include: car insurance ($100), phone ($100), gym ($180)

- payment plan only covers tuition, so i will still need to budget for books, supplies, lab materials

- my significant other helps me offset costs by paying for groceries so i don't worry about paying for food (before i went forward with the decision to go back to school, my largest expense was paying for food); however i still spend about $10/day on eating meals at my job (i can't cook worth a damn)

- i have no credit cards

- for my most recent payment to Great Lakes, i thought i was paying off one of my unsubsidized loans, instead it was disbursed to my whole loans package. i was hoping to have that loan ($380) paid off before starting school in September, but now that i am on the payment plan, i won't have enough money to make another payment before deferment

- when school starts, i need to be able to work at least 31 hours a week in order to keep my healthcare package from my employer, as well as my 401k (i put 5% in and my employer matches it, currently at $2,600)

- when i go back to school, i will be a full time student 

- as my plan stands now, i am beginning my Nursing degree at a local community college which is my cheapest option. Fall semester will be 3 science courses, followed by Spring semester for Anatomy and Physiology I and II, and then i take my HESI exam in order to test into the Nursing program.

- i may transfer to a different college after i pass my HESI (better programs at other schools, but also more expensive...)

- once i become an RN and find a job, i'm hoping to find a hospital/employer that will help finance my BS in Nursing

- i currently use Mint

- savings: $1200 (dipped into savings to pay for tuition), checking: $250 (next payday is this Friday)

- i put $175 to savings every paycheck, and save half of what i need for each months' bills

- my parents do not currently support me in any way (they said they may be able to help with my tuition this year, but i'm not sure if they can afford to)

i do apologize for this post being so disjointed, and please let me know if you need a blurb clarified. i decided on going back to school thinking that i could afford to on my own, but i am thinking that i won't be able to build up savings or avoid taking out more loans, and any guidance would be really incredibly helpful. thank you!

*edit* some things i forgot to mention:

- i currently owe $23,700 in loans from my previous Bachelor's 

- i decided to do AS-&gt;BS instead of an accelerated program because these programs are prohibitively expensive (no loans) and i would have to quit my job (no money at all)

- i have filled out my FAFSA and have not received any financial aid as of yet

- my SO makes about 3x more in salary than i do - in addition to groceries my SO pays rent because it is super cheap (renting from SO's boss)

- Boston area

- i need to take care of my science courses before i test into any Nursing program; so for now i will be continuing with my current school for this semester and spring semester",finance,1438830906

personalfinance,Second Hard Pull Before Refinancing Student Loans,"After having not opened any new lines of credit in years (other than additional student loans), I opened Chase Sapphire Preferred account on 7/14. 

Headed to Europe on 9/21 and wanted to open a Charles Schwab Checking account to avoid ATM fees when there (plus I recently moved and my bank doesn't have a great presence in this area so I need a new bank anyway). 

My concern is that I will likely be refinancing my student loans with SoFi around mid-October. Is the second hard pull from the Charles Schwab account going to impact the interest rates on my refinance, thereby costing me more than I save with Schwab? Considering going with Ally instead to avoid the HP and just paying the 1% + ATM-side fees that Ally offers.

personalfinance,Go Back To School or Not Advice,"My back story: 

I got my AA in 2009 and decided to go and try and get my bachelor's at the State school. 

I messed up big time with grades. To get into the professional program I needed to get my GPA up. 

Each semester I would do well enough to not get kicked out but not enough to where I would get into the professional program. 

This went on for many semesters and eventually with seeing all my friends graduate I lost hope and my grades slipped enough to where I was booted. 

I thought to myself, I don't need a degree I can just work. 

After two years at a dead end job I realized I will never get out of the student loan debt I have accumulated. 

My loans currently sit at $46,000 without a degree besides my AA (which doesn't do anything :( ) 

I know I messed up big time guys and know that the only way I can get out of this debt is to make more money. 

I have been looking at an online program that is through my State's community college that would give me an AAS in Computer Networking (a subject I am definitely interested in) for the first time in a long time I have a plan. 

In the first year I want to receive a A+ Cert and look for entry positions in IT and in the second year finish the AAS degree and receive a Network+ and Security+ Cert. I know it will be hard work but I have been more motivated than ever. 

But...this all requires taking out more loans. 

From what I calculate I will have roughly 80-85 thousand in student loans at the end of the degree. 30kish being in private loans as I will reach the federal student loan limit of $57,500

Do you guys think it will be worth it?

I figure I have two options. 

Option 1: 
Continue to find work that will have potential of making more to be able to pay my current federal loans back. 

Option 2: 
Take out more loans including private loans, incurring more debt but with more earning potential in the future to pay that debt back.

personalfinance,[24M] Need advice on whether I should downgrade my truck to a car with better gas mileage.,"I have been very blessed to have parents that have been able to help me financially throughout my entire  life. 

Back when I started college in the spring of 2010 my parents bought me an 07 toyota tundra. Their reasoning was that they thought it would be safer on the highway than the car I was driving at the time which they had passed on to me when I was 16. 

Once I graduated the title of the truck was transferred from my dad to me(it was paid off the day I graduated). Only stipulation was that if I ever sold the truck my parents would want half of the profit.

Landed a job at the beginning of july making roughly ~38k a year, I have a longer commute than my previous job from 2mi-20mi each way and have been finding myself filling up the tank almost once a week. $57 on average per fill up and  currently getting about 17mpg hwy.  I'm looking to downgrade to a toyota camry and they range from 24mpg-30mpg. 

My plan - try and sell my truck for $12k and then buy a camry for the same price with a down payment of of half ($6k) and finance the remaining $6k through my credit union. My parents have already said they would cosign on the loan for me so that way I could take advantage of being able to get a lower interest rate since my dad has an awesome credit score. 

My question is whether I should try and sell the truck and take on a car payment or just deal with the my current cost of gas for my truck? 

I should also add that I am currently in training and work 5 days a week. But at the end of the month I will transition to only working 4 days a week. 


Thanks for reading

EDIT: I forgot to add the money I would contibute to the down payment myself ($2k) making it a grand total of $8k and the amount financed would be $4k.",finance,1438838146
personalfinance,Need advice.... finally back on my feet and knocked right back down again.,"Throwaway, do not want anyone linking this post to me IRL. I've got a long history: married at 17, two kids by him, he was financially irresponsible and abusive in every way imaginable. I finally left him in 2006, no job, no education, no skills (see financial abuse) and in a ton of debt, most of which I did not contribute to but being in a community property state it doesn't matter. I lived with my mom for a while after, I took care the best I could with the resources I had and my kids and I learned to live on next to nothing. It is a scary thing to live the way we did.

I went to college, got a degree in nursing and licensed last summer. It took a long time to find a full-time job as I'm in a saturated market for RN's, but I finally landed a good paying full-time job in April. I have learned to live on cash and drove my last car for ten years before trading it in for something more reliable - super commuter now. I've been working on rebuilding my credit by always making car payments and rent on time and finally got up the nerve to apply for a credit card last summer which I keep less than $100 balance if any at all. I socked away my tax refund and have been saving additionally. I have finally been feeling financially safe knowing that I had plenty of resources to cover our needs, until this afternoon.

Today, both my saving and checking were completely wiped out by a levy. They even cleaned out my kids accounts because I was the co-signer (one is under 18 still, the other is over and I signed over the account to him, but somehow I am still connected to it). I was never served paperwork regarding a hearing and all of the sudden I am beyond broke as transactions performed prior to the levy, while I still had money, continue to clear my account. 

I consider myself to be a responsible person overall, frugal to moderate lifestyle but when shit really started getting hard in 2007 after receiving a layoff notice, I contacted my creditors. I explained the situation and asked to work things out with them - lower interest rate, lower minimums so I wouldn't incur late charges - and they refused. They were not interested in working with me to make sure I could continue paying on my obligations and they could continue getting payment, even if it wasn't much. So I stopped paying. Even with payments, my balances continued to climb and honestly, I just couldn't afford to pay what they wanted, feed my kids and pay rent (I was not receiving financial support of any kind from my ex). I've survived the last seven years on part-time wages, student aid, child support (finally got a court order in 2009) and with the support of my fiancee.

Well, now I am here and I don't know what to do. I don't know if my wages will also be garnished and I was recently added to my fiancee's bank account to make it easier to pay joint household bills. I don't know if the creditors are aware that we now have this account and I am really scared that our mortgage payment, which is currently sitting there waiting to auto pay tomorrow, is at risk if a levy happens to get served tomorrow. 

So what's next? How do I find out who else might be able to legally come after me now that I am finally self-supporting? All the accounts are charged-off, none of them are even on my credit history any longer and some of the companies are no longer even in business (like Levitz). I am not trying to get out of paying anything, I'll pay what I owe, but I can't just wait around to get wiped out financially and I don't want to put my fiancee at risk financially either. Our home is in his name and we had not considered adding me to title until recently when it seemed like legally, though not morally, I was no longer at risk for these debts.  As far as I'm aware, the statute of limitations in California is 4 years and because it has been well over 4 years since my last payment was made, and I hadn't received a court summons, we felt safe to commingle our money to a certain extent- we still have individual accounts. We are supposed to get married in January and now I don't know if that is even safe to do. Can they take the house or put a lien on it if we are married? I will be removed from his bank account tomorrow and will also be visiting the sheriff's department to see if I can at least get my kids money returned to them and work something out. Seriously, if I knew there was a judgment - even though I don't think it's legal since I never got my day in court - I could have made payment arrangements. This was such an unnecessary thing to do and I am a total emotional wreck right now.

personalfinance,Advice for a 22 year old law student with his first big job.,"Can anyone on this sub offer any financial advice for the following situation? I have a plan pretty well nutted out, but I would just like to run it past some impartial eyes (not friends or family). 

**Background**

 I am a 22 year old male living in Australia. I am a University student studying a Bachelor of Law and a Bachelor of Commerce, and should hopefully graduate mid-way through 2017. I am not worried about student loans, Aus seems to have a better system than the US, and whilst I will graduate with about $80k in debt, our loan repayment plan is automated, and accepted. 

Up until 3 months ago, I have been a shift-worker, meaning my income fluctuated week-to-week. During this time, and for many years, I have been financially careless, taking little concern in credit card interest, savings, or my loan repayment. 

Recently however, I landed a job as a paralegal at law firm, full-time, with a set income, and realised I needed to make some changes.

**Financial situation:**

I have an unsecured personal loan currently with a balance of $18,000, interest rate is 13.45%, with repayments at $126 per week, and a finishing date on that basis of February 2019. I have realised recently that getting the loan was the biggest financial mistake I have ever, or am ever likely to make. For the last few years I have been making the $126 payment every week, but recently I have woken up to the concept of interest, and thought it might be a good idea to pay it down faster. 

I have $1800 in savings which I use for rare large purchases, but mostly retain as an emergency fund, and a credit card with a $1500 limit to which my phone bill, gym membership, car insurance and laptop repayments are all automatically debited to, and I pay off monthly via a weekly automatic debit.

**Weekly budget:**

 Income: $636 (after tax);
 Personal loan automatic repayment: $125
 Personal loan additional contribution: $175
 Savings: $150
 Credit card payment: $65
 Spendings: $120.
 I fund petrol and groceries through weekend work at a coffee shop which pays in cash ($75/week not included in budget).
 Total: $635.

Paying off the loan at $300 per week, instead of $125 means it will be gone by Christmas 2016. 

I still live at home with my parents, who are OK with it. Up until I realised the state of my loan, I was intending to move out with mates, and still am really keen to. However, obviously I wouldn’t be able to aggressively attack the loan and move out, which means something has to be sacrificed. 

Can anyone help me out with this? Specifically, anything I might have missed? Should I be focussing on the loan as heavily as I am, or should I build up more cash savings? Any advice would be welcome.",finance,1438845582

personalfinance,Mortgage vs Car vs Student Loans - Which gets the extra cash?,"I have read quite a bit about differing ways to pay down debt.  Such as tackling the highest interest first or take on the lowest balance first.  I have a situation that I am sure is not unique that involves differing rates, balances, and terms and I would appreciate some advice on how to tackle these.


My wife and I are finally starting to organize our finances and come up with a nice budget.  Everything is going well so far.  So well in fact that we determined that we have an extra $100 every month that we can throw towards one of our loans (we do not have any credit cards to worry about).  Here is the breakdown of our loans:

Mortgage: remaining balance of $193,750 - interest rate is 3.125% - monthly payment of $1,705 - approximately 27 years remaining.


Car: remaining balance of $21,835 - interest rate is 4.34% - monthly payment of $390 - approximately 4.5 years remaining.


My Student Loan: remaining balance of $11,370 - interest rate is 7% - monthly payment of $169 - approximately 5.5 years remaining.


Wife's Student Loan: remaining balance of $4,150 - interest rate is 1% - monthly payment of $72 - approximately 5 years remaining.



So our lowest balance also carries the lowest interest rate.  Our highest balance carries a very low rate as well.  If it makes any difference, we do not see our selves moving any time soon.  I would confidently say that we will still be living in this house 15-20 years from now.  We also don't have any plans to get rid of the car in the near future.  We have to children and this car is big enough for everything they can throw at it.

So...which of those loans would it make the best sense to throw that extra $100/month towards?  Or would we be best served by adding that to our savings (we already save about $700/month and have a sizeable savings)?

I am taking a 5th year of undergrad due to dealing with some rough times. This caused me to have to drop some classes and I have now reached my attempted hours limit. I am also at my limit for federal loans.

Financial Aid office is telling me I have no other option but to get a private loan to cover the remaining amount (I have a small amount of grant money that is helping). This amount is about $3,500 to finish everything.
 
I have no car (staying at a friends place and taking the bus), I do not have strong enough credit to apply alone, and I don't know anyone who can co-sign. In recent times I've lost both my dad to cancer and my mom to an addiction to drugs/alcohol and no one in my family wants to help me. I don't have a very good relationship with them due to me being openly gay. I'm working part-time and looking for something full-time right now, but paying out of pocket is not an option and classes start soon. I wasn't told until recently by financial aid that I'm at my limits for federal loans, which is why I'm sort of in a panic. 

I am trying my best to keep my head up through all of this, but it's hard. I've even almost begged financial aid to help me figure this out and they just tell me that they're sorry and point me to the business office. If anyone has any advice on what to do at this point, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.",finance,1438872053
investing,Why shouldn't I invest my entire taxable account portfolio in state municipal bond funds?,"I'm at a point where I've maxed out my eligible retirement accounts and I have a significant portion of my portfolio in a taxed account.

Looking at the ""market"" over any 30 year period over the last 100 years, I can expect to get about 6-7% annualized returns. Those gains would then be taxed and I would end up with a much smaller return.

Conversely, there are a bunch of muni bond funds that average 5%ish on their lifetime that are both federal and state tax free. Assuming the 5% is better than what I'm left with after tax and investing in stocks, why shouldn't I put every dollar that's not in a tax advantaged account into these tax-free funds?",finance,1438872452

What do you think?","So I'm starting a new job at the end of the month, and as part of the offer, I am getting a $10k signing bonus. Now, I'd like to be smart with this money and now blow it all, since I know I could easily. So far my plan is as such: 

* Take $1k-$1.2k for spending money. I've been eyeing a few camera lenses/equipment and I figure taking a little aside to make myself immediately happy is worth it. 
* Pay off the ~$800 left on my consumer credit cards (currently in an 0% APR intro period, so I'm not losing money to interest by carrying the balance, but I'd rather it just be $0)
* Take $2k or so to add to my emergency fund (about $3k right now) and/or start my moving fund (partner and I are moving cross-country in the next 4-8 months)

This leaves about $6k to do something with. I have a few choices that I can't decide on:

1. Pay off the $4.5k left on my motorcycle loan (6.49% APR, $160/mo that I pay extra at $200/mo) and take the rest and put it into savings/moving fund (or maybe start a fund for buying a used truck; my bike is my only vehicle, and we plan on needing a pickup truck in the future).
2. Keep paying the loan and instead invest the $6k (or $4k and put $2k into a truck fund) into an index or mutual fund
3. Do neither and just keep it in savings to back the loan but keep making payments

\#3 is dumb, I think, since my savings interest rate is less than 1% so I'd save money in the long term by paying off the loan. The only thing I think that can make me pick #2 over #1 is if I can expect to make more than a 6.49% return on any investment I make. Is it foolish to expect that high of a return on an index/mutual fund? I'd love to start a non-401k investment portfolio, but if I'm not getting a better return than my interest on the loan, I'd rather just take some of the extra money I'd be making from my salary raise ($30k more per year, plus reduced expenses soon) and slowly start to build that instead of starting in a lump sum.

personalfinance,Am I saving excessively?,"So I'm definitely guilty of not fine tuning my finances often enough. I am pretty sure I'm saving excessively at this point and should probably throw a lump sum at my student loan debt.

Here's my scenario:

Income: $65k-$80k (Commission based)
Savings: $32k
401k: $15,500k (No match by employer)

Fed Student Loans: $29k Fed @ 6.75%
Private Student Loans: $29k @ 4.9%

My 401k has netted a paltry 2.5% so far. Shame on me for not monitoring it. I think I've already dropped the ball by contributing to it rather than my loans. My plan is to drop my contribution from 10% down to 0% as long as I'm in a situation where no match is offered and my student loan debt remains. I will instead put the money contributed to my 401k toward my Fed loans.

I also think it may be a good idea to drop about $10k toward my Fed loans. That will still leave me with plenty of money for an emergency fund.

personalfinance,Just bought my first car with my Grandma. Not really sure if we were scammed or not.,"So,
As title says, I just bought my first (CERTIFIED USED) car with my Grandma yesterday.
Facts:

1. It was listed online for about $19,000

2. Make: Chevy

3. Model: Equinox LTZ

4. Year: 2012

5. Odometer: 47,000

I can only afford up to a $350 minimum payment.
When we walked out with the car, my bottom line payment is now 366.81; they talked my Grandma into the extended warranty, she said she'd pay the extra $15 a month.
The warranty includes the bumper-to-bumper, and some other things like free oil changes, key replacement, wear and tear.

The loan is in her name, it's got a %2.9 interest rate, which I really don't know if it's good or bad.
Now, the whole time I was trying REALLY HARD to pay attention to everything. When they whipped out the final contract, I think I saw the final loan amount inching towards $30,000, but my Grandma wouldn't let me look at it.
So, I'm confused about a few things;

1. Is the extended warranty worth it

2. Is the interest rate good

3. WHY oh why would the final loan amount be so much higher if the listing price was $19,000
and

4. Should I convince my Grandma to take it back so we can look at something else?


I got my minimum payment, but It was a USED car, and I feel like for however much the loan ended up actually being I could have gotten a brand new one. I'm not really sure or not. Did I get a good deal? Should I just put the blinders on since my Grandmas in this with me?

investing,Why Greece Lender's Need to Suffer,"Great article in NYT Magazine this week on the Euro/Greece crisis. Lots of times in this sub (though not nearly as bad as in /r/finance) the crux of the argument usually boils down to ""they shouldn't have issued bonds that they couldn't pay."" Maybe for pre-2009, this line has merit. But what about since then, when everyone knew the quagmire that was the Greek political economy? Sort of the equivalent to people who blame the 07-08 financial crisis on poor people taking out mortgages they couldn't afford, rather than the professional bankers approving the NINJA loans. [The choice piece from this article:](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/magazine/why-greeces-lenders-need-to-suffer.html)

&gt; On that day in 2009 [Antacular's note: a Greek government bond **auction**] when GR0133004177 was issued, **investors had every reason to assume that this was an especially risky loan.** The Greek government wanted 7 billion euros, or $10.5 billion, which would not be paid back in full until 2026. **These were all sophisticated investors,** who were expected to think very carefully about the number they typed, because that number had to reflect their belief in the Greek government’s ability to continually pay its debts for the next 17 years. I was shocked, looking back, to see **the winning number: *5.3 percent*.** That is a very low interest rate, **only a couple of percentage points above the rate at which Germany, Europe’s most creditworthy nation, was borrowing money.** This was a rate that **expressed a near certainty that Greece would never miss a payment.**


&gt; In hindsight, of course, we know that the investors should not have lent Greece anything at all, or, if they did, should have demanded something like 100 percent interest. But this is not a case of retrospective genius. **At the time, investors had all the information they needed to make a smarter decision.**... **Just *three weeks* earlier**, a newly elected Greek prime minister revealed that the previous government had scrupulously hidden billions of dollars in debt from the rest of the world. In fact, the new leader revealed, Greece owed considerably more money than the size of its entire annual economy....


&gt; The original sin of the Greek crisis did not happen in Athens. **It happened on those computer terminals, in Frankfurt and London and Shanghai and New York.** Yes, the Greeks took the money. But if I offered you €7 billion at 5.3 percent interest, you would probably take the money, too. ***I* would be the one who looked nuts.**",finance,1438887667

It's linked here:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah4pJ0HWzE2cdFRTVWpuMjVEM1dRUmpOUTAtTFJPTlE&amp;usp=sharing

This page will calculate hourly and/or salary pay and will deduct taxes if you enter your typical tax percent.

It can handle up to 40 separate line-item accounts - weekly budgeting, loan accounts, utilities, what-have-you.  You put in the name of the account, the minimum payment and due date(s) -- it will automatically figure out when every bill needs paying for one year.  It starts on 1/1/2016, but you can change the first date to whatever fits for you -- you can also change the ""Date Interval"" to something more useful if you don't want to pay things every week.

It will also alert you when you have too many payments going out by showing your ""remaining"" funds in red.  Those are weeks that you know you'll have to move some bills around or dip into your savings in order to afford everything.  It won't automatically shift things around in order to fit your budget.

If you put a ""-1"" for your due date, the sheet will make a ""payment"" every period.  This is good for budgeting things like groceries and savings and whatever you want to put money towards every week or every paycheck.

If you put a ""Balance"" of -1, the page will keep scheduling payments forever.  If you put a real balance in (for a loan or credit card, for example), it will automatically incorporate the interest rate you entered and calculate a payoff based on your minimum payment.

It will also ""Snowball"" everything with a balance, from the top down, with every remaining penny that you get paid.  The sheet that I shared gives examples of each situation, and shows you how it automatically starts rolling extra payments down until all of your debts (including interest) are cleared out.

You can also enter multiple due dates separated by commas, for example if you pay your mortgage twice monthly you can put 1,15 for the date to make payments by the 1st and 15th.  Quarterly bills can be entered as 1/1/2016,4/1/2016,7/1/2016,10/1/2016 (or other ways around if you're not in the US).

I hope someone else can find this useful.  Just knowing how much money I was going to have available for the next few weeks was what I needed to help get on track, and having one central place for all your bills helps immensely.

It can't write the checks or make more money for you, but you can be damn sure you didn't forget anything.

Bitcoin,"Blockstream's federated sidechain model would be ideal for 'permissioned ledgers'. If financial institutions adopted the technology for their internal ledgers, it would make the entire financial sector connected via Bitcoin's blockchain","Blockstream's Elements Sidechain uses a federated security model that it calls Fed-Peg:

https://blockstream.com/2015/06/08/714/

&gt;The initial sidechain included in Sidechain Elements works on a federated security model; while it’s still peer-to-peer and consensus-based, security for the blockchain is provided by a set of predefined functionaries in an arrangement called a Fed-Peg. A number of academic groups and individual contributors have agreed to run the Sidechain Elements Fed-Peg, including blockchain groups at Stanford, MIT, and Princeton. The sidechain does not include mining or proof-of-work at this point.

In other words, it's a permissioned ledger. Like other permissioned ledgers, its potential applications are much more limited than those of Bitcoin's permissionless ledger, due to its reliance on a small number of parties for maintaining consensus on the state of the ledger. This model, despite is shortcomings, is the subject of significant interest within Wall Street, according to a recent talk given by former JP Morgan executive, and current Digital Asset Holdings CEO, Blythe Masters:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clc3ZOP2zUo

If large financial institutions do end up replacing their existing systems with permissioned ledgers modelled on Bitcoin, it would be a major boon for Bitcoin's public blockchain, and the state of global financial interoperability, if they used the Fed-Peg model created for the Elements Sidechain, because it would allow permissioned ledgers to transfer BTC to and from the Bitcoin blockchain, via the federated pegging mechanism. It would mean that value could be transferred between any number of permissioned ledgers, using the public blockchain and BTC as the medium.

Bitcoin's public blockchain would then act as a sort of internet of money, and BTC as the universal value carrier, while the permissioned ledgers become the various intranets that are used internally by companies.",cryptocurrency,1438903721

100% repayment history on 5 current and/or active accounts. 


5 accounts in collections. Total is $2026, and three of them are from 2009 so they should fall off next year, if I'm not mistaken. One of them from 2013 I am going to research through bank statements and old files (it was a daycare that my son attended then, and I'm pretty sure the account was paid in full when we moved but I want to be 100% sure. 

One credit card balance of $1456, which was paid down quite a bit until it was used recently for substantial but much needed home repairs (roof/siding damage). Limit is $1500 so my ratio is high. 

I have the ability to pay almost half of my cc balance. After that, should I make a few monthly payments (I can do about $100 a month realistically) to bring the balance less than the 20-30% recommended for the sweet spot range, then look into opening another account with a (hopefully) higher limit, transfer the balance to that new card and pay down the small remainder during the 0% grace period? I'm looking to get to an ideal position so I don't have a hard inquiry/new account attempt while having the high ratio and getting denied. I'm looking at using a 0% balance rate/no fee promo. 

Ideally, I would like to have the increased credit line so my ratio is low, have a safety net for true emergencies, and make small monthly purchases and pay it off each month for building history. 

I am lost at how to time it all. Al the while keeping in mind the year until those three fall off reporting--at this point is it worth tracking down three long lost debts that total less than $500? If I do attempt to square those accounts away to zero won't they still fall off after a year? I'd much rather use that $500 toward my current card balance, which has a fairly high interest rate. 

I hope I made sense. If I can clarify anything please ask me.

I have my first job- $73k annual gross income in a federal job, and I need a car.
I have never financed a car before and need advice.

Background: 

-21 years old

-Senior studying mechanical engineering (graduation December of 2016 currently)

-Relevant job experience (3 internships related to degree) 

-Disciplined with money

-Currently (BEFORE THIS FALL) owe ~$14,500 to the government with interest rates sub-5%

-Have the option to take out another $4,500 in government loans for this academic year to help cover cost of education

-Receive NO financial support from anyone (living on my own since 18)


I have some questions for you all in the personal finance group regarding my next financial steps. 


My first question is should I take out the full amount in the loan? I have the ability to pay the difference between my living/college costs (tuition/cell phone/health insurance/etc.) and scholarships/grants with the income I've earned from working. However, that would leave me with about $1,500 to my name at the end of the year. As I said earlier, I have no one to fall back on financially if something big comes up, and that scares me.


My second question is should I maintain a student job? I am a software trainer that makes $11/hr during the school year. The job is a cakewalk, I love the people, and it's super flexible. However, I was stressed from all my stuff last semester. My time consisted of responsible partying, studying, and being involved. I don't party hard, but I do enjoy going to the bars on Friday nights with my people. Not giving that up, you only live once ha. I work out 4 times a week (adds up to about 7 hours each week). Relieves the stress, keeps me healthy, and I mean who doesn't like working toward looking attractive to women? Anyway, I also am very involved in student organizations, and I maintain a respectable GPA. However, for all you who keep up with tech, you may have heard that SpaceX is hosting a Hyperloop Competition. Well, I'm lucky enough to be the president for the team at my university, so that'll take up a lot of time that I already did not have. I also am debating graduate school for engineering (at a top ranked program, if I'm lucky), and I think that involvement in a groundbreaking-engineering competition looks a lot better than training college students on how to use MATLAB or Garageband. But then it comes back to cost, that's about $1,100 I'm forgoing by not choosing to work. I guess I'm not sure if I can afford that, or if I should put myself in even more debt .


Third question is should I pursue an internship/co-op during the spring to make money (and gain more experience)? This means I would delay graduation by another semester, but I would also make more money to put toward my loans in order to ease the debt burden when I finally do graduate. 


My last question is simply me asking for advice to those reading this. What are some things I should be doing for contributing to my future financially? Should I open an IRA? Should I pay that debt as quick as possible (keep in mind the interest rate is *very* competitive). 


If you've read this far, I commend you.

A little about my personal situation: I've gone to a California Community College for the past two years, while I've worked 30 hours a week (earning $10.50-12 per hour). By being very frugal with my money spending, and also by saving most of my school's financial aid, I've saved $10k of my work income and $11k of my financial aid (5.5k per school year).

personalfinance,Commission check taxes.... help?,"Okay, so I don't get this at all. 

Here's the deal. I work at a car dealership. I love my job, but one thing I do not understand FOR THE LIFE OF ME is the taxing on my commission checks. 

I get paid weekly, a flat hourly paycheck like most people in the world. Fine. I have 2 tax deductions/exemptions/dependents whatever you want to call them, so the same amount is always withheld. I live in FL, so there's no state income tax (neat!), so I basically know every week what my takehome will be, plus or minus a few dollars for overtime/short weeks, whatever.

But my commission check? I don't get this at all.

This month, for instance. 

My bonus check was $2,280 gross. Not bad - actually a pretty good month if I do say so myself. But they took a ridiculous amount of it away in taxes. $624.11, to be specific.

Here's what my statement says:

Gross: $2,280
Federal: $449.69
Social Security: $141.36
Medicare: $33.06

WHY is this such a higher tax rate than my regular pay, and what can I do to minimize it? Am I going to somehow owe more money at tax time, or is the government basically borrowing more of my money interest-free? How can I reduce this? The accounting office woman told me one way to reduce it was to have the weekly check and the commission check deposited separately, so I did that, but I still feel like they're taking A LOT. 

Any ideas?


tl;dr - taxes on bonus check are too damn high. How to get more of that back without owing at the end, and preferably, without getting a refund?",finance,1438947028

personalfinance,Should I finally buy a house?,"My SO and I have been paying rent for the last 5 years and we are tired of it. At least when you buy a house you gain equity. In the mean time, we also have student debt that we have taken from -$65,000 to about -$53,000. The minimum payment each month for that is $500. We currently pay rent of around $800 for a small apartment.

We each make about the same, after benefits deducted from her check, so around $35,000 each.

We have started the process and told our realtor that $150,000 is our max.

Currently we only have about $7,000 cash, and I do have a 401K of around $20,000 (that I don't want to touch). I will get a VA loan.

Bitcoin,"The ""fee market"" will not compensate the next halving of miner revenue","The next block reward halving, due sometime next year,  will suddenly cut the revenue of all miners in half.  There have been claims that keeping the block size limit at 1 MB would result in increased fees that would offset that loss.

That will not happen.  The total miners' revenue now is about 1 million US$ per day.  The fees would have to be ~3 US$ per transaction to compensate a drop by 500'000 $/day.  They will never rise that much.

The result of keeping the 1 MB block size limit will be only to drive users away form bitcoin.  As the normal traffic approaches the network capacity -- maybe in 6 months time, when it is expected to be 150'000 tx/day -- there will be frequent ""traffic jams"", when the network receives more transactions per minute than it can confirm, and tens of thousands of unconfirmed transactions will pile up in the queues.  During such jams, the average time for the first confirmation will increase from the normal 10-15 min to several hours.  Some clients may be able to jump the queue by paying higher fees; but the average waiting time does not depend on the fees, so it will be a zero-sum game -- every time one client jumps the queue and secures space in the next block, some other client will be pushed out to the next block.  So, many clients will end up paying more ***only to wait a lot longer***.

The traffic will never exceed the capacity (estimated to be about 180'000-200'000 tx/day), since the average delay would become unbounded in that case (many issued transactions will *never* get executed).

personalfinance,Inspection was just done on a house we're in process of buying. BAD results. Advice?,"Hey Everyone,

My wife and I are in the process of buying a house. In the initial walk through with the realtor the house looked well maintained and all work was professionally done. In short, we loved the house and it was everything we have been looking for in our price range. No other houses compared below 145k. The comps in the neighborhood are around 15K higher than our accepted offer price.

I felt even better after reading the seller's disclosure which said the roof was 7 years old, no water damage, and no other faults of any kind. I thought i was sending an offer for a goldmine, but it ended up looking like a money sink.

The inspection was done last night (took 4 hours). Here is the list of major issues: (plenty of unlisted minor issues)

The roof was never replaced; it has 2 layers of shingles and patches all over the place. There is more tar on the roof than a tar pit. Inspector said it is way past its life and needs replaced ASAP. He's also afraid that it will not pass appraisal.  Also, the added on attached garage has a rolled roof that is rotting under the gutter cover because the cover was never installed properly. 

There is cracked mortar on the front corner of the brick which isn't too big of a deal, but a repair was made to the foundation at an earlier time above that crack and the crack was evident behind a picture in the living room.

There is a 40-50ft tree almost touching the house that is infested with carpenter ants that would need to be removed.

Mold is growing behind the furnace. Mold would need to be removed.

The electrical panel is Federal Pacific which, after reading the reports of the breakers for this company, I’m surprised the house hasn’t burned down yet. It would need to be replaced. (More information here: http://www.ismypanelsafe.com/fpe.aspx)

There are other smaller, minor issues, but the ones i listed above would be my main priority. I have owned a home already for 8 years and know how to fix many of the other problems. 

The issues listed above are deal breaking, but i feel that if the seller negotiated it would be doable. What I’m thinking of negotiating with is:

Getting contractor estimates on 90% of the reported issues.

Seller to provide cash credit towards 4 of the major repairs.
Purchase price lowered to compensate for all other repairs.

Am i asking too much here? The house was listed for quite a while and i have been the only offer. The seller also vacated the property so I’m assuming they want the property sold ASAP. Is there any other advice you can give me?


Edit:
All, i know this is somewhat of a real estate post. But the reason I’m coming to personal finance is i want to know if it is feasible this could be worth it if the repairs are all paid for, and i get an extremely low purchase price. I have no intention of walking into the home if negotiation isn’t heavily in my favor. But would it be worth it from a personal finance side if i got this extremely cheap with cash for the major repairs?

Edit2: 

THANK YOU to everyone who have posted. Most of you have given me great advice and its really great that this subreddit has such knowledgeable people in it. I think overall the property may not be worth it considering how much dishonesty was done during the disclosure. It does scare me not knowing what else will be found during the renovation. I doubt the loan would get accepted if they saw all the cash credits i would need and i wouldn't trust the seller to make the repairs since they have lied so much already. 

We're going to be thinking about it more, but right now i'm more heavily weighted against the house than i was before posting this. Thanks again everyone. Big help!

Edit3:

This thread was awesome. So much info here and I'm glad I posted here. I showed my wife this thread and we both came to the agreement it will not be worth it and we don't have the out of pocket cash needed for renovation. We withdrew the offer and are asking for inspection costs back (doesn't hurt to ask given the state of the disclosure, might even take the seller to court. Even if I lose, which is likely, maybe it will stop them for lying to someone else.)

As the title reads, I would appreciate some feedback on my plan for the coming 5-10 years. I will begin a 5-year programme in biotech engineering in a few weeks, and hopefully start saving cash!

So thanks to generous student benefits + loans, I will receive $1240/month. I have calculated my living costs to be $686/mo, thus saving $554 monthly. This would add up to $27.7k in the end of my studies. The plan is to invest this in two different funds, resulting in 80% stocks and 20% bonds. One Global Index stock fund, and the other with a collection of bonds. 

The student loan currently has an interest rate of 1%, and will have to be repayed before I turn 50. According to the repayment plan the debt would be $47k(interest incl.). If I scrapped my savings plan, and only loaned what I need, it would be $23k (also interest incl.).

Ten years from now, I hope that this has grown into a good down payment for a modest flat. Then I can begin saving aggressively from my income. I have not consulted anyone IRL, and I'm just wondering if this sounds reasonable? I want to avoid debt as much as possible, but I fear I might have to rent forever if I dont start saving?

My uncle who raised me was always deliberate and careful to explain finances and how to handle investments. This has made me so frugal that I spent over 4 years to buy a house as I created spreadsheets to determine the cost of a house down to adding the per-mile cost of driving to and from my job of each option as part of the real cost of ownership of the house. This extremely deliberate approach of measuring costs of debt versus return on investment, break-even points and opportunity costs has made my life fairly easy to live now after years of struggle. I have been looking at reducing my long term costs again by adding renewables to my home, and I wanted to get some feedback before making my decision.

It would cost about $25,000 to put solar shingles on my home. This is about $19,000 for parts and $6,000 for labor. The return on this is approximately a savings of $130 a month. The cost of a 10 year mortgage is about $241 per month. However, there is a 1/3 return from the federal government for about $6,333.33 tax rebate. I could turn that back into the 10 year mortgage and reduce the overall time  and cost. I may end up moving to a new home in about 5 - 10 years. There isn't anyway to know how much return on investment this upgrade will give my home.

I have read advice in the sidebar and found other people here that have succeeded in negotiating lower rates/repayment plans with Navient. I have tried this and Navient has told me there is nothing that can be done. Their reasoning for this decision is that my father (co-signer) has too high of an income to even consider his debt to income ratio. I have requested a lower interest rate and do not qualify, I do not wish to pay interest only or extend my loans' term. 

So refinancing comes to mind, because having all of these loans at 7% or lower would save me money in the long run, I believe. I don't work in financing and I can find sources that push one way or another but maybe someone here has been through this as well.

“Do not dwell on the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment”
–Buddha

Good day members,

As I sit here at a sidewalk café, not much different than the dozens of others lining this street, I notice something amiss. Where have all the sign-spinners gone?

With just a few weeks left in “summer break”, we decided to fill up the tank and hit the road for one last vacation before the mountains of homework, music lessons and baseball practices become our daily routine.

Every August, as most folks head north fleeing the heat and oppressive humidity, the Caesar clan packs our bags and begins our short, leisurely trek to the southernmost city in the continental US. Home to writers, artists, independent thinkers, nut-jobs and runaway criminals, Key West truly is paradise on earth.

A crazed looking man with a deep scar on his face drinks Cuban coffee with an alarmingly thin woman toting a large beaten suitcase and a mangy dog. Next to them, two 50-somethings downing Bloody Mary’s talking loudly about how much they love it here, and how the heat isn’t bothering them one bit.

The waiter asks them if they’d like another. They oblige. “And some ice water please.” Their sunburned skin and Hawaiian shirts give them away. They’re some of the last straggler tourists in town this morning, at least ones that are awake. The few others are still asleep/passed-out after a long night of performing their best Ernest Hemmingway impressions. Apparently, Hemmingway drank here, there and everywhere. At least that’s what the marketing materials tell us.

The man with the scarred face pays his tab in cash and slithers away down the alley alongside me. His companion packs up her bags, leashes her dog to the sad looking suitcase and heads in the other direction.

It’s August, and the town is for locals now, just as we like it. The next three months belong to the artists, the drifters and the crazies. I’m not sure which category I fit into yet. I sure as hell can’t paint.

As I sip my café con leche, I’m looking over the data from yesterday’s markets. It’s no wonder why I haven’t seen any sign-spinners begging to buy my gold. Gold’s in the proverbial shitter.

Like any bubble, you can literally see the peak when Joe-Schmoe on the corner is hawking the latest fad (beware vape shop owners).

We Buy Gold! We Pay The Most!

But only the diehards are still buying. Somehow paying the rent on their pop-up kiosks as gold continues to slide. There have been fewer and fewer sign-spinners offering to take precious metals off our hands.

This may actually signal a buying opportunity. I should ask the flower shirted tourist couple what they think. They’re buzzed enough on booze and coffee to give an honest opinion, that’s for certain.

5-year-Gold

Gold hasn’t traded this low in years. But the market isn’t selling off on the “recovering economy” but rather fearing an interest rate hike and accounting for the global mess out there. Everyone from Anchorage to Zurich is buying US dollars, driving gold lower.

Of course, once gold is “cheap” enough, and the dollar too strong, the smart ones will jump back into yellow metal and abandon the dollar… imagine a sign-spinner displaying “we buy cash.” If you see that, get out of the dollar asap.

This scenario (less the sign-spinner) may occur sooner, rather than later. Gold, the dollar index, US dollar ETF’s and the stock market have already priced the likelihood a Fed hike in. But, if it’s raised a just quarter point, rather than some drastic move, gold could begin to rise once again.

No matter what you hear, read or see, money has to remain cheap or the fragile economy will falter. It’s the illusion of strength that matters to our government, not the facts. And Uncle Sam loves his printing press. He can’t pay his debts without it.

The Fed will show their cards with a quarter point hike. The market will cheer; stocks will jump and soon after gold will follow. Those in dollars will realize it’s over printed and overvalued. Buying the dollar now may in fact be a top.

There’s no turning back with a rate hike, the Fed can’t raise rates too high only to roll them back later on. So it has to be either small, or fatal. The street is patiently waiting for Yellen to make her call this September. Bet on something very small, if anything at all.

The two tourists have paid their bill in cash and wobbled out. The only ones left are my waiter and I.

He’s a 20-something kid who has likely seen more oddities in his short Key West life than Robert Ripley could have dreamed of. He’s wearing a gold chain with some sort of silver coin attached, much like the ones sold in the gift shops near the Mel Fisher treasure museum. Even those shops aren’t too hip on buying gold. They’ll sure sell you some though.

Tomorrow we head offshore to the Gulf Stream to do our best Hemmingway impression. Apparently, his other hobby was fishing.

personalfinance,Paid off my student loans today,"Background: graduated from law school in 2011 with about 75k in student debt (no private loans). Full disclosure: I lived at home with the parents and did side gigs during law school that gave me some spending money. Additionally, parents did help with tuition. This is why I did not graduate with 100k+ in debt.

After graduation I did not have a full time job coming out, only a contract gig at a small firm that lasted until 2012 when things got tight at the firm. During that time, however, I put a lot away towards student loans because I continued to live at home and did not have a car. 

After the firm gig dried up, I kicked around to a couple of other month long (or so) contract jobs at firms before I really started to hate law firms. From there, I worked at a history research firm (lots of litigation research stuff) and then worked my way into a permanent gig in the federal government a year and a half ago. 

Method: Avalanche 

Take aways: I didn't have a lot of fun these past few years. No vacations, did not really go crazy with spending at all. Paying down my loans became my major hobby and I dedicated roughly 1/3 or more of my monthly take home to it each month. Live at home as long as you can if you are able.

stocks,"LL Analysis - good, bad or indifferent?","Eating my humble pie here, I took a nibble on Lumber Liquidator (LL) back around $24 and obviously have taken a bath since.

If you've not been following the news, they had ""bad"" Q2 results (not shocking) and dropped another ~20% this week. Here's why I'm thinking about taking the plunge.

So evaluation is tricky...

This year's earnings are a crap shoot. Estimates anywhere from .01/share to .60/share which puts the current P/E anywhere from 120 to 20. Even 20 would seem high given the circumstances but this year is likely an anomaly with estimates for 2016 being back up in the $1.00-1.80 range. Current P/E with the 2016 estimates are in the 12 to 6 range.... fire sale prices right??? HD = 24. LOW = 25.

So next question is, are 2016 estimates worth a damn? Will they survive long enough for the theoretical recovery? Their Q2 results that just came out show sales down about 16MM or 6%. They got destroyed on the market for these results. To me, that's a fricking touchdown if I'm running LL. After all of this continued bad press for the last 6 months, the top line dropped 6%. And that drop is likely due to deep discounts to keep people walking through the doors. Now net profits dropped at a much steeper rate for the same reason which is more worrisome but still. The first quarter, likely to be the worst quarter since the controversy broke saw only a 6% decline in sales. 

Ok, but what about the impending fines from the feds and/or civil litigation. The federal investigation involves the Lacey act. The last instance of a fine I could find online was Gibson guitars to the tune of $300k. LL has put on the books an expected liability of $10MM and another $3MM in inventory forfeiture. Chump change for a billion dollar a year organization. The civil law suits gets more interesting... the more I read the more it sounds like this formaldehyde testing is a complete hoax. ie No agreed upon testing standards no way to prove damages and no consensus from ""experts"" about accepted safe levels. While this doesn't prevent lawsuits from being the final nail in the coffin I'm beginning to get the impression this will end with the option of replacing some laminate flooring. 

Lastly, financial statements... do they have a cash flow crisis? Can the weather the storm? Gets a little fuzzy. They have 45MM in cash compared to 58MM accounts payable. Seems bad at first. But that's actually an improvement compared to the beginning of the year, which was a 20MM/80MM ratio. And add to that psudo-quick ratio an inventory worth 262MM (think that includes the bad inventory but that only accounts for 3% is my understanding.

At the end of the day, total assets of 481MM minus total liabilities of 177MM = 304MM divided by 27.1MM outstanding shares = $11.21 per share. At $12/share that's almost a 1:1 ratio. Insane right???

I setup traditional, bank-ran, 529 accounts for each of my two kids shortly after they were born, and we ""caught up"" the younger one so they are almost exactly the same amount right now.   The kids are currently 7 &amp; 5 (11 &amp; 13 years from graduation), and the accounts have a little under 25k each.    We still put about $250/month into each account - $6000/year. 


This is what I'm considering: Set with MET
http://michigan.gov/setwithmet/
It basically allows you to pre-purchase college at Michigan Universities - U of M and MSU, but also lets you cash out for out of state schools.     This does fall under 529 tax rules -- so it would be tax exempt for State and Federal tax purposes.


Some other factors:    I'm 43, so my 401k &amp; IRA accounts should be accessible when the youngest is 21-22 years old.     My wife and I max out both work 401ks and the Roth (when MAGI allows) every year, and this will always be a priority over the 529 accounts.   We are also able to save a minimum of $1k to 2k every month, after tax, sans vacation or big purchase.  


Finally, I don't necessarily want to pay 100% of the kid's schooling.   That's not really the goal here.   I want to give them a big head start, but would like them to have some skin in the game when it comes to that point.  I also wouldn't want them to feel obligated to go the University route.

**Questions:**  
1. In your opinion(s), is this a decent 401(k) plan?   
2. I selected my 401(k) funds when I was 23. I am now 26, about to buy a house, plan to get married in the next 3 years, and am more serious about saving for retirement. Should I make changes to my portfolio given my new focus? What would you suggest and why?  
3. I just realized I have the option to make pre-tax 401(k) deferrals or Roth 401(k) deferrals. Right now I am contributing to the traditional 401(k). I make relatively little income and plan to retire in a much higher income bracket, so I’m thinking it would be smarter to contribute to the Roth 401(k). Does that make sense?  Otherwise, I'll probably open a Roth IRA with the cash I have to invest.

Banking,Humor me and talk about how I can protect my $ from a bail-in/depositor haircut ala Cyprus (and possibly Greece),"I have roughly $240k in a local credit union. I'd like to take some action to protect that $ from the possibility of a [Cyprus-style bail-in](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/29/bank-of-cyprus-depositors-lose-savings/2595837/) as well as possibly [Greece](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3188638/Greece-lenders-need-bank-recapitalisation-year-end.html).  It's $240k because I'm pretty sure when I looked into the Federal Insurance on credit unions, it was $250k, which came via Dodd-Frank.

I know, it probably sounds doom and gloom and paranoid, but humor me here.  I'm thinking of at least spreading the $ out across 3 separate banks where the account balances are divided equally around $80k each. The idea there is to stay under 100k as the Cyprus bail-in was on 100k+ euro accounts. I could always add a 4th or 5th bank/credit union and spread the money out more.

I'm also actually looking to buy some land (with the goal to retire/build on) which I will pay cash for so I want to retain some cash liquidity. I have various retirement accounts going as well, so I'm not really looking to tie up/commit this $ outside of land.

I would love to hear your thoughts on how to protect myself from any sort of bail-in/economic disaster.

PSERS pension has two levels - T-E which has contribution fluctuate between 7.5% and 9.5%, and T-F which fluctuates between 10.3% and 12.3%. This is federal income tax exempt. If I retire prior to being vested, the pension fund guarantees a 4% growth. The payout (assuming I work the 10 years to become vested) is 2% * Final Average Salary * Years of Service, which is reduced by an early retirement factor. I can't find the exact number, but it looks like it should be 3-6% for every year early I retire prior to 35 years of service.

No other debt though so I got that going for me, which is nice.

Problem is I am about to go into grad school next month and I will be taking a substantial income hit.  I know that this is what deferment is for but I really don't want to rack up the interest so I have been looking into consolidation options for the private loans, because I can defer subsidized loans with no interest.

I asked for a second opinion on my financial options from my girlfriend's (of 5 years) father.  He is about to go into retirement and is looking for safe investments.  He offered to buy my private debt and came up with the following payment plan: Every month I give him 250 cash, 100 goes towards principle, 150 goes to interest.  Any additional money I give him goes towards principle.  This is essentially a 4% fixed interest rate which is better than anything I could ever get from a loan company and a really good, safe investment for him. Also since it is not a typical amortization the % of my money going to principle is way better than if I did it with a company. 

To dodge the IRS gift tax, I will be receiving multiple sub-14K gifts from different individuals.  The plan would be for him to give me 14K, his wife to give me 14K, and then he would give 14K to my GF who would then give that to me.

At the end of the day he is left with a solid investment, I have a great consolidation, and everything is legal by the books.  The only thing that may be illegal is if he did not report the cash I give him every month as income but that's his choice.

Does this all make sense?  Why don't more people do this?  Is it just because it comes down to trust?

Let me start out by saying thank you to all the mods and contributors of the subreddit. The content and advice you provide is such a valuable resource, so thank you for all that you all do!

My situation:

I'm 28 and a recovering opiate addict. I got sober and moved back with my parents after struggling with addiction and making poor financial decisions during the first half of my 20s. I defaulted on my student loans, and owed several other debtors, and financed a 2006 Hyundai at what I can only assume was a 20+% interest rate. This was in December 2013. Over the course of 2014 I worked on self-improvement. I returned to school in fall of 2014, paying out of pocket, and finished my associate’s degree this past summer in July 2015.  During that time I got my student loans out of default, and worked on maintaining emergency fund and accruing some savings.  I transferred to the local university where I should finish my bachelors in wildlife and fisheries science in the next two years, and hopefully go on to get my masters. I refinanced my car at the local credit union, $4400 @ 11% interest, 4 year loan but I want to pay it off in 2 years so I've been trying to double up on payments as much as possible. Now, during this time I've been living at home, and been able to save approx 6k in a “premier” checking account that earns 3% dividends, while working at a serving job where I make approx 25k, and paying for school out of pocket as much as I can. I’ve been working hard in school this time around, and am hoping for continuing education scholarships and a larger Pell grant as I apply for scholarships in the fall/spring. I wasn’t eligible for any upon transferring unfortunately. 

Now I'm at the point where I can move out on my own, though I still get some anxiety/ hesitations about if this is the right step. I’ll likely live on my own for about 1 year while my girlfriend finishes her student teaching internships (which is unpaid or we would move in together currently). Is this the right decision to go forward on my own? I feel like I should move out on my own to “prove” to myself that I can handle my finances appropriately first before I fully commit to somewhat shared finances with her.  What’s my next step? Will I be able to afford an apartment on my own? 1 bedroom near my university is about 600-650 factoring in water and electric.  Should I continue paying off the largest interest rate while taking out as little in student loans as possible? What should I do to continue to build better credit? My score when I refinanced my car was ~612.

Hopefully you guys can give me some insight on what my best course of action is. I'm 18 years old, fresh out of high school, and I currently have no debt of any kind. I have decided I do not want to go to a traditional 4 year college due to the fact that the cost is outrageous and I think I would have more fulfillment in starting my own business[es]. However, I have been looking at going to a 1 year technical school for audio engineering in Chicago. I want to own my own recording studio some day and this place would allow me to get hands on experience with that. The price of the 1 year diploma program costs approx. $18,000. I have visited the school and have talked to the financial advisor. I would have to take out loans to go there. List of payment plan:
$18,000 total
-$5000 from federal grant (don't pay back)
-$2000 in federal loan (pay back within 10 years; interest starts immediately)
-$3000 in federal loan (pay back within 10 years; only interest if not paid back in time)
The other $8,000 will be signed over to my mother with the parent plus loan. There is interest and it too must be paid back within 10 years.
Lastly, since I don't live in Chicago, I have the option of taking out more loan money to pay for living expenses. We have figured that $6,000 would be enough for 1 year just as an emergency fund. 
I have $5,000 cash saved up from working and selling things. My mom has agreed to help me pay for an apartment, food, etc. 
My question is: Should I go to this school now as planned, or would it be smarter to work for a year or two in Chicago to save money and pay for the school without going into debt?
I hate the idea of debt. Freedom means a lot to me. I don't want to be held back. Although people have told me that the amount of money I would owe is not that much compared to people going to college/university.

We've maybe had it good for a few years now with the 0.5% rate, but does that mean the future is doom and gloom? Are things like mortage etc going to get harder to afford for people who can't afford to save while life gets easier for people who can afford to save?

personalfinance,Considering making a lump sum payment on Student Loans. What might I be failing to consider?,"Hubby and I make decent money, save relatively aggressively. At this point, it seems obvious to me that we should make a lump sum payment to completely pay off our highest-interest loan, and then apply the payments we would have been making towards it to our other student loan until it is paid off in about 3 years. 

Is there anything I'm failing to consider that would make this a bad idea? 

Current assets and debts (rounded):

Checking account - $8,000

Savings account - $38,000 (where payment would come from)

AMCAP fund - $16,000

Additional investment in VFINX - $5,000

401(k)s = $18,000

Personal student loan = $19,800 (account we would pay down) at 6% interest rate. Currently pay $580 per month

Federal student loan = $26,000 at 5.75% interest rate. Currently pay min payment of $250 per month

Car loan = $9,000 at 4.15% interest rate. Pay $350 per month

Ignoring the 401(k)s which we obviously do not intend to touch for a very long time, we have $67k in cash/investments in case of an emergency. Even with the lump sum payment, we would have $47k left. 

I should mention we each make around $50k per year, and save 20% of each paycheck, as well as 5% each in our respective 401(k)s to get the employer match.

personalfinance,(AUS) First time getting home loan. Any advice?,"Hello personalfinanciers,

I am about to embark on the journey of my first home loan. First, a bit about myself:

* Age: 26
* Income: $145,000 (AUD)
* Property type: Off the plan 1bdr
* Purchase price: $625,000 (feb 2014)
* Current valuation: $680,000 (independent valuation)
* Capital Appreciation forecast: 8.4% pa
* Loan amount: $500,000
* Interest Rate: 4.45%-4.9%

So there you have it. I have already claimed the First Home Buyers grant when I paid my stamp duty which was already due ($18,000). I have over $125,000 saved up of which I paid a 10% deposit when I purchased over 18 months ago. The $62,500 is in a interest bearing fixed term deposit. If it makes any difference, I live a very frugal life. No car loans, no credit card debt and no student loans or anything like that. My post tax income is $8k per month (including bonuses), yea tax is unbelievable here in Australia!

From my initial research my repayments would be around $2,500 per month. I get paid bonuses every quarter around $10k, I'd like the flexibility to pay this straight into the mortgage. 

* What exactly happens when I do this? Does the principal reduce by $10k? Does this mean I pay less interest over the long term or do I just pay it back faster? 

* If I can make more than 4.5% interest on this 10k every quarter is wiser to invest elsewhere?

* If I live in this property for say 3 years and then sell, do I pay any tax? Wouldn't the lack thereof make it a great place to invest my bonuses?

* I hear a lot about politicians leveraging negative gearing to reduce the taxable income. What exactly is this? Do I simply deduct the difference between my rental income and my mortgage repayments on my investment property? Are there any pitfalls in turning your own home into an investment property 12 months down the line?

personalfinance,I am an apprentice in Australia and have the option to take out a $20000 loan over 4 years (more details below),"Apprentices in Australia are eligible for a $20,000 loan paid in monthly increments over the course of the apprenticeship. At the end of your apprenticeship (if you actually finish at and get your trade certificate) you get given a 20% discount on this loan, so you only end up paying $16,000 back.



You pay the loan back through the income tax system at a rate of approximately 1% of your tax (I am not 100% sure if its 1% of tax or 1% of total income) it has a very low interest rate and you are only obliged to pay it if you are earning more than $55,000 a year.


Now, my question is 

Would it be a financially responsible decision to take out this loan? If so what should I do with it.


I am financially secure, have minimal expenses and live quite comfortably and i do not need the loan to survive, however i thought there might be some good if i invest it or just keep it in the bank etc

personalfinance,Medical student trying to build credit... how?,"I know very, very little about personal finance, so any help is much appreciated. I'm a medical student who is fortunate enough to not have to borrow loans from the federal government, so credit has never really been a problem for me. However, I know that I need to start building credit ASAP. The only thing I know about this is that in order to build credit, I need to sign up for a credit card and start making payments. The problem is, I have essentially no source of income (my parents are ""loaning"" me the money for medical school). Are there any credit cards I can obtain?

* Savings account: 17k

* Checking account: 3k

Since I live in a cheap student neighborhood, my costs are quite low and I end up saving 30-40% of my paycheck most of the time. I probably have 2-3 years left in school (so 2-3 years of loan deferral with no interest accumulating). My financial goals include paying off my loans, saving up for a new to me car, and IRA contributions. I would like to make IRA contributions while I am in grad school, but I will not pay off the loans or buy the car until I finish school. I would like to leave 10k as an emergency fund in my savings account.

Currently I have just been dumping all of my extra money into my savings account with plans to divvy it up among my IRA, future loan payments, and future car money.  I am confused about how best to allocate the money currently. Right now, I could see one of two plans:

*  Max out IRA contributions each year; leave whatever small amount is leftover in savings account as future loan payments/future car money

* Make less than maximum IRA contributions &amp; leave more money in my savings account to pay off loans/buy car when I finish grad school

personalfinance,Recently got a new job and my new income is 3x+ what I was making before. How do I best set myself up best for the future?,"I'm 19 years old about to go into my second year of college.  I'm studying information and communication technology with a concentration in networking.

Basically I was working at 8 dollars/hour in a retail job, when I got an opportunity to work at my cousins' networking company.  I have greatly enjoyed it so far, love working for them, and the paychecks are outstanding.  I am making 12 dollars/hour as a base rate, and what I make may or may not go up, depending on the project we're on and how much they pay.  For example, with the project we are on, I'm making 18 dollars/hour (with some opportunities for OT).  However, once we finish this project, that will change.

My question is, what do I do with this crazy new income in order to best set myself up for financial success?  Right now I have only 5500 dollars + interest (just over $100 right now) on a student loan, with the interest rate at 4.66%.  My mom is helping out with paying for school, which is right around 16K/year.  My paychecks are right around 1000 dollars each.  I have no bills other than gas, as everything else my parents pay for, until I graduate college.  I live with my parents when I'm not away at school.  I have around 2K in my checking, 1.5K in savings, and 3.5K in what I think is a mutual fund, which I have no intention of touching.  

Is it best to take a large percentage of what I'm going to be making in the next ~month or so before I head back to college and pay off as much of my student loan as possible?  I will only be able to work at this new company when I come back for winter and summer vacations.  I might get a job at school, working maybe 10 hours/week for gas, food, etc., to help from my checking dipping too much.

personalfinance,Does paying towards principle on student loans automatically take it out of forbearance?,"So my husband decided to put his loans in forbearance after his grace period because we wouldn't be able to afford the payments and the person that he talked to on the phone said he wouldn't qualify for IBR. Having read up on the qualifications I don't think that's right. In total he has 40k in fed loans and our agi last year was 35k and with overtime this year we're probably on track for 40-45k and we're a family of 3. Seems like a no brainer to me that we would qualify for a ibr payment of ~175/month. Right? Maybe I'm missing some other qualifiers.

So since his loans have been in forbearance we've been focusing on my loans and paying them down because I thought my interest rate(6.3%) was higher than his at ~5%. Turns out the majority of his are actually 6.8%. Now knowing that I want to focus our efforts on paying his loans down. A couple of his loans are only 3.4% and 4.5% and I'd prefer to pay the least amount possible on those so we can funnel all our extra efforts on the loans with 6.8% interest. So for loans that are all serviced by FedLoan, if I start paying down the principle will that take the loans out of forbearance? I'm talking payments that would be at least as much as our monthly payments on the standard repayment plan. And then my next course of action would be to have him actually apply for an ibr plan when forbearance ends because I think we qualify. But would the decision be affected if they see that we've been consistently been making monthly payments that are more than the payments for standard repayment?",finance,1439009673

I know the app is up to something, as I can watch the log file at ~/Library/Application \ Support/Dogecoin/debug.log and it is flying by at a million miles per minute.

I have 4 receiving addresses, and if my memory serves me correct, that is what it should be.  though I seem to recall two different things in the past.  First, I could see how much doge coin I had, and second, there was a progress bar somewhere that told me where I was in syncing with the blockchain.

I really wanted to go with the wallet version that only grabs bits of the blockchain, but it requires the instal of an old Java, and I am hesitant to do that as it has caused me trouble in the past.

How do I get what I remember, the progress bar, and my current number of coins.

Also, totally off topic, I found a folder zipped up that I stuffed away called BitCoin.  It has a wallet.dat file in it, as well as a bunch of others.  What software do I use to read that?  I remember when I was using it there really weren't that many wallets, so I used the main one, whatever that was, now there are online, offline, all sorts of them, and I don't remember what app I used to generate that wallet.dat file.

investing,Risk vs reward in the current market. My situation and a question.,"I just recently entered the market in February. I invested against my emotions, that we are currently topped out in the market. I understand the idea that you should not try and time the market.

Since February I have put in $30,000 into a Vanguard account with a 70/30 Stock Bonds split, weighted about the same in regard to US vs International. I feel I am well diversified. My only debt is a car payment, I'm 33 with a stable decent paying job.

My question is this. In a U.S. market that has thus far performed flat this year...Is the *return* of a very optimistic 7 to 8% worth the risk of liquidizing for the next 12 months to wait out the result of the Fed rate hike and stabilization of the International market for good or bad?

Right now my investments are break even. I feel that even *experts* can't seem to come to a consensus about the current market. Even though this feels like a giant post trying to legitimize the timing of the stock market, I can't help but feel waiting on the outside may be worth the **generous** assumption that I might make $2100 (which seems highly unlikely right now) in the next 12 months.

An option we are considering is to buy an apartment near the CBD (as it's ideal for our work) - probably something with two bedrooms around the $500k mark.

I would be the one to buy this; my partner would continue paying off her mortgage and then start contributing to mine once hers is paid off. Her house would be rented out once we move - expecting approx. $400 per week.

After the apartment is paid off, we were thinking about renting it out too and buying a third, larger place in which to start our family.

I live in Somerville, MA and I currently rent with two roommates. I love this city and I really like the area. I can imagine living here another 10+ years with my current job. I got in my head recently I'd really like to own a house instead of renting especially since I have a dog and it makes finding a suitable apartment very difficult. I also talked to my roommates and they got excited at the idea of me owning a house and them just paying me rent (that hopefully covers a good chunk of my mortgage payments). 

I've looked at Zillow, and with my income and $20,000 for a downpayment, I could afford about $500,000 house if my monthly debts were $0 (which I know they're not). But that price means I could feasibly buy what is considered a cheap house in our city. 

My question is how feasible is this idea? I've grown really attached to the idea and want to make it work but I deep down I know it's probably a pipe dream. Bring me down to earth. How would you manage the situation? Please feel free to ask me questions if left relevant information out. Sorry if I'm being stupid. I obviously am well off but it's because of my career, not because I have great fiscal sense. 

Other stuff: 
I do over-pay my student loans currently. I dump about $2500-$3000 in them per month, making the minimum payments would save me about $1500/month

I wouldn't bank on my roommates staying with me forever, just for the next 2-5 years. Even with two years it gives me enough time to reassess my finances and save up more. 

I would be a first time home owner (though I don't know all the benefits that confers yet, still googling). 

I want to live in a city. I know that means I pay more for less, but it's the lifestyle I want and it's one thing I'm not willing to compromise too much on. Somerville is very walkable, dog friendly, everything I want is nearby, and I enjoy that aspect of my life.

I’ve lurked on here for a long time but I’ve never posted.  I would really appreciate some help getting my financial life into shape.  I’m 25 and fucked around in school for a long time.  I’ll finally be done this year.  I have 35k in student loans and my AmeriCorps Education Award is paying for this last year of school.    I’ve been serving at an AmeriCorps member for the last year.  My stipend for the year was $12,600 in an expensive city.  My health insurance and the majority of my food expenses were covered.  My service year is over next month and I’ll be starting a position making double that.  It’s very entry level at approximately 25k/yr.  My plan is to be there for a year or 2 and then eventually move to a more affordable city with my partner.  I was raised in poverty and have been slumming it as an AmeriCorps member for a while so I’m nervous that I won’t go about paying my debt down in the *right* way. Even at 25k, this is the most money I’ve ever made.  Any advice is appreciated.  My monthly expenses and my current debt are as follows:

Rent: 600/month.  My partner and I pay our rent based on income.  I pay $600 and she pays $880.  Once I start my new position this will go to up to $740/month. 

Federal Loans: 34,830.  Don’t technically need to be paying them back right now because I’m in school but I’ve been throwing $100 at them here and there as my stipend allows me too.  I’ve paid back a grand total of 800 over the last 11 months. 

Credit Card Debt:  $3643.  I generally do not use my credit cards.  My ex and I had a rough break up and I put my remaining portion of what I owed on our shared vehicle on my interest free (until 10/2016) Amex in order to sever our ties completely. 

Transportation:  I walk or bus (free with my job) everywhere. 

Food:  I spend around $50 on groceries/month.  I don't eat/drink out unless I'm being treated. 

Cell/Internet: $120/month.  

I currently have $780 in my checking and $313 in my savings.  I have about $400 more dollars from the AmeriCorps coming my way.  I start my new job early September.

My partner and I would also like to start passively saving for a very small wedding and house over the next 2 years.

I don’t necessarily know what I’m asking for.  I’m nervous because I’m making double what I lived on this last year and I just want to make sure I’m doing things correctly.  Any help or tips are appreciated.",finance,1439044533
personalfinance,Advice on our next step.,"24/f

I work as a dental hygienist 2 and 1/2 days a week making $33/hr. 

27/m

My husband is on contract as a computer security analyst making $26.44/hr. His contract ends April 2016. He is still in school getting really close to finishing his Bachelors in Information Security. He will finish school anytime between March 2016 - May 2016. 

My schooling has me (currently) in ~$48k in debt. Graduated 2 years ago. Most of it is Federal sub and usub loans in a 25 year graduated repayment plan, while the other $8,200 is a private loan standard repayment over 10 years. I have been doubling payments on this private loan to pay it off in 5 years. Currently my payments to loans are $215.37 for federal loans and $135(x2) for my private loan, or $483.37/month. 

My husband will have around $20-30k in debt from school when he finishes, since he is still in school we are not in repayment for him. All of his will be federal loans. 

SO- because his contract ends soon he is searching for another job. However, without having a completed degree a lot of companies have weeded his resume out of the system. He is BARELY starting to look for work. He recently had a phone interview and the job would pay roughly $74k/year. A lot of his coworkers have left my husband's current job, some without degrees, getting over $70k.

We have $20k in savings currently. 

Currently we rent month-to-month at $1,145. We didn't sign another contract (which would have made it roughly $990-$1,050/month) because we know we will be moving and don't want to be stuck in a contract, they wouldn't work with us to get a 6 month contract and the shortest they would offer is 8 and we know for sure we will be gone way before 8 months. 

We want to live 45min north of where we currently are. I have to commute 30 min to work and 1 hour home (traffic). Whereas my husband's current job is 5 minutes away. But that job isn't forever and there's no chance of getting a non-contract job there. Most jobs my husband has been looking for are 30-60 min north of where we currently are. Our family and most of our friends live 45-60 min north and we want to be closer to them and love the area up there. 

Where we want to move, if we rented, the cost to rent is exactly what we are paying now month-to-month or MORE. 

We both are set on moving, but on the condition that my husband gets a different job first. 

Long story short- if you were US, when my husband does get a job (realistically around $70-80k), would it be beneficial to RENT for a year when we move (12-month contract paying roughly $1,200-$1,400/month) and put money into savings to put towards a down payment on a house, or do our finances check out to buy a house at that time? We would be looking to buy a house anywhere between $280k-$320k. We have been renting for 4 years of our marriage, have a dog, and it would be super beneficial to have a yard for her, and we are also just sick of renting apartments. But on the other hand we are willing to be patient if it can significantly impact our financial future.

personalfinance,"22 (F) Camgirl, first time filing taxes and getting screwed","Started camming in 2014, made money, paid taxes, then told I didn't pay my state taxes.

I went to H&amp;R Block to get my taxes done. Gave them my I9 that was sent to me from my modeling site, and then wrote off some dildos and other expenses. I was told how much to pay federal and state. I went to my bank and got a cashiers check for each. Then i mailed them to the address my tax adviser had previously given me. End of story, RIGHT?!

Wrong. Fast forward 6 months, and I get a paper in the mail saying I was late on my taxes. I assumed it meant my quarterly payment I had set them up previously. I sent in my June quarterly payment. Fast forward one month and I get another letter saying I'm late on my taxes so i call my state tax office. Only then do i realize they mean I'm late on my state taxes from 2014. wtf.

So this has been ongoing for three weeks and here is my predicament. I went to my bank and they tracked the check and said it HAD BEEN USED. I got a copy of the cashiers check from my bank and faxed it to the department of revenue. The department of revenue tells me that the copy of the check doesn't have the endorsement on it, and they need to know who used it in order to look into it. My bank says that the copy they gave me is all the information they can get. 

My Plan: Stop payment on check, pay initial balance over phone, and refuse to pay any interest or penalties. The copy of the check i faxed them should be proof I paid it on time right? But my bank doesn't know if I can stop payment since it has been used. Here I sit typing this. What can I do?

TLDR; Paid my state taxes, told I didn't pay state taxes, cashiers check used to pay said taxes has been used. standoff between bank and tax office.

I'm currently underwater in a car loan. The car is worth between $17-18k, with a $24k payoff amount. The interest rate is mafia worthy and I want to avoid harming my credit any further when getting myself out of this car loan.

All payments have been made on time and the loan is still current.

I don't have the savings to shore up the car loan, and I need to be out of this car loan and into something more affordable, without involving it getting repo'ed.

I'm sharing this because 1) I'm proud of myself, 2) I want to share good news with the community who helped me out along the way, and 3) motivation for others.

I followed the 'avalanche method' as explained in the wiki.  Some things to consider when looking at the numbers in my pic:

* In 2011, I made $12/hr and living expenses (rent, water, electricity, waste, food, gas) were roughly $800/month.  I also  enrolled back in school to get my masters degree.
* In 2012, I made $18/hr and living expenses stayed at $800/month
* In 2013, I made $25/hr for the first half of the year while living expenses stayed at $800/month.  I also received my masters degree shortly after (June of 2013).
* Masters degree cost me on average $5,000 a semester (roughly $25,000 in total for tuition only)
* In 2013, I took a job offer that doubled my salary and moved me to an area that more than doubled my living expenses.  I used this year to pay off my $10k of credit card debt while starting savings for a 6 month emergency fund and heavily funding my 401k and ROTH IRA
* In 2014, I received a bonus and raise which allowed me to aggressively pay off my debt (in the graph that's where my monthly payments jump from about 200 to 1,000+)
* From 2011 to 2014, I cooked 95% of everything I ate (shout out to /r/slowcooking).  I also rarely purchased new or expensive personal items, and when I did it was for friend/family experiences like music festivals, holiday vacations, etc.

I do want to acknowledge that I feel very privileged how this all turned out...the fact I was able to put myself through school by borrowing money from the gov, kind organizations/individuals who helped with scholarships and grants, living in a relatively cheap area of the western US before relocating, having a supportive group of friends and family who helped via odd jobs paid under the table for additional cash, random acts of meals, occasional lending of vehicles, etc.  I think this entire adventure was a 33/33/33 combination of hard work by myself, help from others, and just plain old luck.

I would love to hear your opinions and appreciate any advice towards my situation with student loan debt. Here's the breakdown:

I have $80,000 in private  student loans (wells fargo) that gives me a monthly payment of $720. The private loans were taken out for me by my dad and cosigned by my grandmother as I went through college paying little attention to what I was unknowingly getting myself into. (Side note: I would appreciate we not focus to much on the stupidity of the decisions to take out that much in student loans... we couldn't approved for anything federally and I know it was a huge mistake. Since there is nothing I can do about that now i'd like it to not be a main point of discussion)
I am now struggling to pay the monthly bill as I live in a rural area with little job opportuinity and am working at a non profit. I can't move, save etc with this financial situation and there is no end in sight. 
I have talked to Wells Fargo frequently about other possible repayment plans and they tell me my only option is to consolidate. However I have been denied to consolidate my loans even with a cosigner....
I'm at a loss for how to approach this.

Unfortunately we needed a second vehicle before we got where we wanted to be credit score-wise. After spending most of the day crunching numbers at the dealership, our only real option without needing a cosigner was at 20%. Godawful, I know... but our other options at this point was buy-here-pay-here or quit my job because I can't make the commute.  

So we opted for the newer car with the high interest rate over an old high-mileage car that would probably hit just as hard interest-wise (and require doing business with the shadier places in town). First payment is due 9/22. As of today, she's at 582 and I'm at 518. I know we need at least three months of good payment history for it to even make a blip on our reports, but how soon would it be prudent to shop for refinancing at a more favorable rate? Our payment fits into our budget, so I'm really trying to save on interest over the term over getting the payment lower as well as exercising our healing credit. 

Thanks!

edit: Well it seems everyone is so worried because I can't afford the payment. It's $315/mo. We have a $300/mo. mortgage. Our credit is screwed because my wife was diagnosed with cancer a few years back. We've made a lot of headway in correcting the issues, but the time came that we needed a reliable vehicle sooner than we would have liked. So instead of buying yet another beater that will leave me bumming rides to work AGAIN, we went with the safe bet even if it costs more. The monthly payment isn't the issue. Hell, the interest isn't even a huge issue because we can afford the payments. I just don't want to pay so much in the long run if I can help it.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3gag3v/lets_say_i_wanted_to_print_out_1_worth_of_bitcoin/)

And that got me thinking. What if schools had giant donation pools that anyone can contribute to, and that money is given directly to the students for correct answers on all test. They would then use that money for college.

&gt;According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, outstanding student loan debt in the United States lies between $902 Billion and $1 Trillion with around $864 Billion in Federal student loan debt. As of Quarter 1 in 2012, the average student loan balance for all age groups is $24,301.

I think this couldn't easily be done before bitcoin, but may really give poor kids the encouragement to do a lot better in school. 

I was thinking that each kid would be given a Bitcoin Public address that would be attached to his school record. Using smart contracts, any money put in, wont be able to be extracted until enrolled in college. And then that money can only be used on college expenses. If you finish with a degree, then what ever is left is for you. If you don't go to college or don't finish. Then you can choose different schools to donate too. Or you might want to donate directly to a specific student to help their future out. This also might make one consider spending their college money on dorms, or saving money by living at home and commuting, but when you finish college, you may have enough to buy a car or move somewhere where you can find a job in your field. Its basically a trust fund using smart contracts. 

The idea is, they could earn 10 cents or 25 cents per question. Larger assignments or more advanced classes could have higher value questions. This could start as early as 2nd-3rd grade. At that age, you wouldn't probably tell them. But maybe by time they reach 5th or 6th grade, they can understand how important education is and they will want to work toward earning a great education earlier. 

All test questions would be evaluated and appraised. 

a small percent of all sports tickets sold at school events goes to all the players involved, encouraging students to try more sports and music/art performance. And in the sports events, the money would get distrubuted evenly, but the winning team could get a bonus. 

I could super easily donate to my old high school by going to their home page, and scanning a qr code for their giant student fund. Beep. Done! Brighter Future!

personalfinance,Dave Ramsey's Book from a Mortgage Lender's POV,"As the title indicates, I'm a mortgage lender here in the Bay Area.

I agree with almost all of it. There are a few caveats, however, that I would note:

* **""No traditional credit / alternative credit"" is not the same as ""shitty credit.""** You've got to get someone before they turn 18 and get their little starter college credit card, or you've got to wait 7-10 years, to have ""no credit.""

* In this 7-10 year gap where Jane got her starter credit card, but never used it, and is waiting to have ""no credit""... she has shitty credit. **This will possibly impact her apartment and job searches.** 

* A manually underwritten 15 year fixed mortgage for someone with ""no credit"" (using alternative trade-lines like cell phone and insurance bills) is generally going to have a higher interest rate than a 30 year fixed with mediocre credit. **This means that most people would be better off taking a 30 year fixed with mediocre credit, but making 15 year payments.**

* If you have shitty credit, or any credit at all, I can't have it done as a ""no credit"" loan. I can only do this if I go through the motions of pulling your credit, and the credit reporting agencies say they have insufficient information to score you. If that little starter card with a $250 limit is being reported to the credit reporting agencies and nothing else, I have to use your 413 FICO score (eg, not going to happen).

* Taking a 15 year at a jacked up ""no credit"" interest rate is a steep price to pay for any belief system. **Much more cost effective is to get whatever shitty credit card you can get, buy your significant other one nice thing every few months, and pay the full balance down as soon as the bill comes in.** 

* If you do that, you can certainly do a 15 year fixed with decent or good credit with an amortization schedule that will kick the shit out of a 15 year fixed ""no credit"" loan.

personalfinance,The dual income and married tax,"A lot of people think that if you are married you will pay less in taxes.  This is not necessarily true (though for most people it is).  If you and your spouse both earn good incomes then you might be better off (financially) being single than being married.  [Here] (http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/10/30/irs-announces-2015-tax-brackets-standard-deduction-amounts-and-more/) are the income brackets.  

To illustrate this I created [this chart] (http://i.imgur.com/EjsnXj9.gif) that shows taxes by income for a couple filing jointly and for two singles **who each make the same taxable income**.  For example, if you and your spouse were single and each made $100k in taxable income then together you'd pay $42,142.50 in federal income tax vs $43,049 if you were married.  Just being married and making a combined $200K doesn't mean you're getting screwed.  The relative amount each spouse makes is important.  If one person makes $200K and is single their tax bill would be $49,606.25.  If they married someone who makes $0, their tax bill would go down by $6,557.25!

The breaking point starts at a combined taxable income of $152,000.  At this point the marginal tax rate for a couple filing jointly is 28%, however, for a single person making $76,000 (half of $152,000) the marginal tax rate is still 25% and doesn't increase to 28% until $90,750. 

A few key notes:  

I'm only looking at taxable income here.  Obviously there are personal exemptions, standard deductions, etc. which could change the results on a case by case basis.  

If you find yourself in this pickle of a situation, don't think that you can solve this by filing separate returns! Being married and filing separate returns is not the same as being single.  Just look at the brackets!  Married filing separate has income ranges that are shrunk so that two people who earn the same amount of taxable income will pay the same as if they were married.  

Also I realize that this only occurs when you and your spouse both make pretty good money.  If being married is costing you some in  taxes and this is the worst thing that is happening to you, then you're living a charmed life, carry on!",finance,1439126462

Bakkafrost is the largest and only public traded salmon producer on the Faroe Islands and offers a wide range of different salmon products including whole, gutted salmon, value added products and fish-meal, -oil and -feed (FOF). Bakkafrost produced 44.013 tons of gutted salmon and 85.724 FOF in 2014. 

 Bakkafrost owns six hatcheries, 19 farming sites, five wellboats, three harvesting plants, two VAP plants and an FOF plant. The current investment plan started in 2013 and is planned to add another wellboat (delivered July 2015), another hatchery (expected to be completed in Q2 2016) and a merged harvest/VAP plant (expected to be up and running in 2016). 
Bakkafrost is fully vertically integrated. The current (2014) company structure can be seen below (Havsbrún is the FOF plant).

 Below is a quick historical overview of Bakkafrost’s evolution from a small, family owned company to a successful, public company.  

 **1968** - Bakkafrost was founded by the two brothers Hans and Roland Jacobsen. The early Bakkafrost was mainly engaged in catching and processing of herring. 

 **1986** - Production of farmed salmon and smolts (young salmons) began. 

 **1995** - The first salmon value-added-product (VAP) factory was built and the production capacity of VAP products was increased in 1999-2001. Bakkafrost continued to grow both through M&amp;A activity in the early 2000’s. 

 **2008** - Bakkafrost started merger talks with Vestlax (another salmon producer). 

 **2010** - The merger went through making Bakkafrost the largest fish farming company in the Faroe Islands with 55% of the country’s salmon production. Bakkafrost went public in 2010. 

 **2011** - Bakkafrost acquired Havsbrún, an FOF plant. This acquisition made Bakkafrost fully vertically integrated – from the production of FOF all the way to production of VAP and sales. Being fully vertically integrated, Bakkafrost has complete oversight over all the critical production points. This helps insure a high quality product and full traceability. 

 **2013** - Bakkafrost announced an ambitious 5-year investment plan to make the onshore operation more efficient, to increase organic growth and to reduce the biological risk.

 **2014** - The best financial result ever was reached in part because of the Russian import ban on Norwegian salmon. Bakkafrost is currently being led by the son of Hans Jacobsen, Regin Jacobsen who has been the CEO for over 30 years. Bakkafrost was named OSE second best mid-cap company in 2014. 

 Note: Bakkafrost reports financial numbers in DKK (Danish Kroner) but is listed on the OSE and trades in NOK (Norwegian Kroner). Conversions between the two currencies will be made throughout the analysis at a rate of DKKNOK = 0,8225.

 **Brief industry overview**

 The salmon industry is composed of producers from many different countries spread out over the globe. The biggest producers are located in Canada, Chile, The Faroe Islands, Norway, Scotland and the United Kingdom where the biological conditions for salmons are optimal.

 [Figure 2 - Harvest volume by country](http://i.imgur.com/4PK1lYH.png)

 Back in the day salmon was mostly caught in the wild. Nowadays salmon –especially the Atlantic kind - is primarily farmed. The change has been driven by increased global demand combined with limited expansion capabilities in the wild due to fishing regulations, quotas and biological restraints. Farming salmon as opposed to catching them in the wild has the advantages that it gives greater control over the production, easier catching/ transportation and better disease control. 

 [Figure 3 - Wild vs Farmed by volume](http://i.imgur.com/C9cYo1l.png)

 Salmon is most often sold and bought in the spot market(s) or on longer term contracts with a price based on the spot price. The historical price can be seen below. Note the trending nature of the price but with large short-term volatility. 

 [Figure 4 - Salmon spot price - 25 and 50 MA](http://i.imgur.com/1n7lPBS.png)

 The spot price is driven by the balance between supply and demand (obviously) which is affected by several factors. The supply is affected by political intervention such as regulations/quotas, new investments in farms and equipment and biological/geographical factors such as diseases and weather conditions. Some of the factors driving the demand are global wealth growth, global population growth and focus sustainability (salmon farming is far more environment friendly than classic creature farming). Note that the key demand drivers are primarily megatrends.
 
 The salmon farming industry is near maximum farming/biological capacity and increasing the capacity requires large capital expenditures to new farms, processing plants, well-boats etc. As a result the global supply is expected to increase 4-5% in 2015 and 2-3% in 2016. The expectation is a yearly 3% supply increase until 2020. A balanced market with no change in spot price seems to be reached with a global supply growth of 9% per year. This strongly suggests that we will see salmon prices continue on its long-term climb in the coming years. 

 In August 2014 Russia imposed an import ban on European salmon. This created a major supply vacuum in the Russian market and enabled non-EU salmon producers to sell their fish at a premium. Bakkafrost has been a major beneficiary of this development. At the moment the ban looks to be standing as long as the situation is tense between Russia and the Western world.

 **Recent share price development**

 The chart below shows the 52-week development in Bakkafrost’s share price.

 [Figure 5 – 52 week share price](http://i.imgur.com/U7qyihS.png)

 The overall trend has been upwards mainly attributed to great financial results and the Russian situation. In the period October 2014 to April 2015 we saw some consolidation and falling share prices mainly attributable to falling/consolidating salmon spot prices. After the Q1 results reported on the 12th May we saw a strong upward movement in the price as a result of the great financial results achieved in the first quarter (it was the single best quarter in the company’s history). 

 **Management and shareholders**

 Regin Jacobsen is the CEO of Bakkafrost (1982-present day). He holds almost 4.5 million Bakkafrost shares worth over 100 million US dollars. This equals 9.2% of the total outstanding shares. His mother Oddvør Jacobsen owns 9.4% of the outstanding shares. In total the Jacobsen family owns 18.6% of the outstanding shares. The large insider ownership secures a strong alignment of shareholder’s and management’s interest. Other insiders own 0.4% of the outstanding shares. There is no option salary program in Bakkafrost and thus no (potential) dilution of the shareholder’s interest in the company except – of course – from any future equity issuance. 
 
 Regin Jacobsen has transformed the small family owned business to the Faroe Islands’ biggest and one of the world’s most successful salmon producers (looking at profit margins). He won a price for being the best CEO of a mid-cap company listed on the OSE in 2014. Salmon analysts have called the current management team the world’s best Atlantic salmon management team. 

 Reading the management’s letter to shareholders and listening to the conference calls, it is clear that the management has a long term focus. The long term focus is seen at large in Bakkafrost’s ambitious long-term investment plan.

 Having a strong management team combined with no potential dilution and a long term focus is a big bonus in my opinion. On top of these qualities it gives me faith in the company’s future prospect to know that the CEO (and family) has a lot of skin in the game. 

 After the Jacobsen family, JP Morgan is the biggest shareholder and owns 7.8% of the outstanding shares through five different subsidiaries. 

 **Products, customers and geography**

 Bakkafrost is engaged in the production and selling of fresh/frozen fish, VAP’s and FOF. 

 FOF is produced at Havsbrún. The major part of the produced feed is used in Bakkafrost’s own farming segment. Only 20 % (17537 ton out of a total production of 85724 ton - FY 2014) of the produced feed is sold externally to other fish (salmon) producers. The FOF business is generally highly volatile due to underlying volatility in the raw products (fish leftovers and/or different plant parts) going into the production of FOF. The Q1 EBITDA margin of 30,53% in the FOF segment is not sustainable and is related to very favorable raw material cost at the end of 2014. In earlier years the EBITDA margin has averaged around 10-15%. Bakkafrost uses a higher content of fish oil in its feed than the average in the fish feed industry. This makes the production of feed slightly costlier but results in salmons with higher fat (omega 3) content. Feed cost is one of the largest expenses in salmon farming and the FOF plant provides some stability regarding prices. 

 Whole gutted salmon (or head on gutted – HOG for short) is sold at spot prices to fish markets/other wholesalers. Selling salmon at a volatile spot price gives a somewhat volatile revenue and income stream. Bakkafrost has historically achieved nice margins in this segment.

 VAP’s is sold on longer term contracts to retailers and wholesalers. The prices on the contracts are based on the forward price in the salmon markets as opposed to the spot price. VAP contracts are 6-12 month in length and given the fixed price, provides a more predictable and stable income than the fresh/frozen segment. The EBIT margin achieved in the VAP segment is considerably lower and more volatile than in the fresh segment. 

 In 2014 45% of the harvested volume was used in the VAP segment while 55% was sold whole and gutted. The long term goal is to sell 40-50% of the harvested volume as VAP products. The new VAP factory will help achieve this goal as harvested volume increases in the future. 

 Bakkafrost is located favorably to export their products all over the globe. Historically, most of the Bakkafrost fish has been sold in the EU and USA. The fattier salmon taste obtained by fish feed with higher fat content is a big hit in the US. Asia has taken an increased amount of Bakkafrost fish in recent years mainly for use in sushi.  

 In 2014 a higher fraction of the fish has gone to Russia as a result of the supply vacuum following the ban on imported Norwegian salmon. Bakkafrost salmon can be sold at a premium in Russia as a result of this situation. As long as the tension between Russia and the Western world remains (and the import ban is intact), Bakkafrost is expected to sell a larger than average volume to the Russian market. 

 **Competitive edge**

 Bakkafrost operates in a commodity-like industry where true competitive advantages are somewhat rare. Bakkafrost, however, do enjoy some competitive advantages which are pushing their margins higher than industry average. One of the competitive advantages is permanent and related to the geographically location of Bakkafrost’s operations. Another one is temporary and related to the Russian situation. The last is related to the current management team and is long-term but not permanent.  

 Bakkafrost has a permanent lower feed cost because of the biological conditions in the Faroe Islands (more stable temperature throughout the year among others). As mentioned earlier the feed cost is one of the main costs in producing salmon. Having a lower feed cost provides Bakkafrost with a nice competitive advantage. This competitive advantage is well-protected through a limited number of farming licenses and Faroe regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning more than 20% of any salmon farmer.

 Bakkafrost is not affected by the Russian import ban on European salmon. As a result Bakkafrost has acquired a sizeable chunk of the Russian salmon market and can sell its salmon at a premium compared to the spot price. This is a temporary, but possibly long standing, competitive edge. 

 On top of these two competitive edges, Bakkafrost’s management is highly skilled and focused on efficiency throughout the organization. Bruce Greenwald has stated that companies operating in commodity(-like) businesses need to have a strong focus on being the lowest-cost producer and operating as efficiently as possible. I would consider the skill of the current management team another competitive edge.

 **Risks**

 Bakkafrost is exposed to several company and industry specific risks. 

 A lower salmon price is one of the major risks faced by Bakkafrost and other salmon producers. Both top line and bottom line is heavily influenced by the salmon price. A long time with low/declining salmon prices will push the revenue and earnings down and hurt Bakkafrost.

 Since feed cost is one of the major costs associated with salmon farming, a rising feed cost will have a negative impact on Bakkafrost’s profit if it isn’t followed by a higher spot price. Feed cost is influenced by commodity prices which are highly volatile and hard to predict. This risk is somewhat mitigated by Bakkafrost’s ownership of an FOF plant. 

 Diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites such as sea lice can hurt or kill the salmons and is another risk involved in salmon farming. Overall Bakkafrost has a good control with its salmon production and disease-risk has been managed tightly. Bakkafrost is actively engaged in research aimed at controlling these potential problems and is currently working on a solution to the sea lice problem by employing sea lice eating fishes (so called cleaner fish) in the salmon farms. The new well boat delivered in July is also capable of treating sea lice infected fish through a fresh water treating facility. 

 Bakkafrost is enjoying higher margins as a result of the Russian situation. If Russia removes the import ban on salmon from Norway and other EU countries the salmon supply to the Russian market will skyrocket. Bakkafrost will be hurt somewhat by this as they can no longer sell their fish at a premium. 
Overall Bakkafrost is a fairly risky business. This will be reflected in the required return used in my valuation model. 

 **Financials**

 In this section I will take a closer look at Bakkafrost’s financial statements. Some of my comments will be about my own and/or the managements expectations for the future. This will be used in the later forecast needed to make a valuation. 

 [Figure 6 - Income statement percentage change](http://i.imgur.com/jcOmxxN.png)

 [Figure 7 - Income statement common size](http://i.imgur.com/enbzumL.png)

 Looking at the income statement we see the numbers of a profitable and growing company. 

 Revenue has been growing 34,49% per year since 2010 which is attributable to a larger harvest volume (44013 ton gw in 2014 against 21626 in 2010) and a higher realized price per ton gw. We saw some slowdown in the revenue growth from 2013-2014 but I expect the growth to accelerate in the coming years as a result of the expected higher spot prices and the results of the investment plan. Especially the plan of reducing growing times of salmons from 18 months to 14-15 months gradually over the next 3 should provide a nice boost on the top-line in the coming years (guided at ~4% per year over the next three years from this development alone).

 The most notable thing in the operating expenses section is that expenses have grown considerably since 2010. This shows us that Bakkafrost is not a company that can grow without investing in more raw material purchases, higher expenses to salaries, more PP&amp;E (leading to higher depreciation charges) etc. Even though expenses have grown, they have only grown at (roughly) the same pace as revenue. This means that we have (roughly) the same operating margin today as we did in 2010. Given the high operating margin back then, I consider this a great result and it shows the management’s dedication to efficiency and meaningful growth. 

 The new harvest/VAP plant being built as part of the investment plan is expected to reduce operating expenses by 70-90 million DKK per year from 2017 and onwards. Together with the other parts of the investment plan, this makes me believe that Bakkafrost will keep on having expenses under tight control while revenue is growing nicely. 

 The fair value adjustment on biomass and (provisions for) onerous contracts are both IFRS-related non-cash adjustments made to the operational result every year. The fair value adjustment on biomass is an adjustment to reflect the current value of Bakkafrost’s biomass given changes in spot price and other changing (biological) conditions. The “onerous contracts”-item is related to the long-term VAP contracts and other contracts related to raw materials. A negative “onerous contracts”-post means that Bakkafrost is locked in contracts where the economic benefit will be lower than the cost of fulfilling the contract. In 2014 we saw a reversal of 2012 and 2013’s negative posts because conditions changed and the negative impacts were not realized as expected. As seen, both fluctuates and are very difficult to forecast with the information provided by Bakkafrost in the financial statements. 

 “Income from associates” is Bakkafrost’s share in the income of its associates P/f Pelagos (30% ownership), P/f Salmon Proteins (76% ownership), P/f Keldan (25% ownership), Hanstholm Fiskemelsfabrik (40% ownership) and P/f Faroe Farming (49% ownership). I expect these companies to attribute with a small, positive result in the future if salmon prices rise. 

 “Listing costs”, “badwill related to the acquisition of Havsbrún”, “acquisition costs” and “loss from sale of subsidiary” are non-recurring charges. The first two were one-time charges related to the listing on the OSE and the acquisition of Havsbrún. The last two are related to Bakkafrost’s acquisitions and sale of divisions/related companies. Bakkafrost has mentioned that they will make meaningful acquisitions/take stakes in other salmon-related companies if it is at good terms and in line with the overall strategy. 

 The financial income is related to the interests earned on Bakkafrost’s big cash position and any dividends received from associated companies. 

 The interest expense is related to the coupons on the bond issue, interest on the revolving credit facilities and interests on the instalment loan (all three described in greater detail under the balance sheet section). Note that the current interest expense is covered many times over by the operational earnings (and operational cash flow). 
The net currency effect is related to the currency gain on the 500 million NOK bond. 

 The currency gain comes as a result of the sharp decline in the NOKDKK pair (Bakkafrost reports numbers in DKK). A currency-swap is in place which swaps the NOK to DKK. This means that the currency gain/loss is counteracted by a loss/gain on the currency swap. This counter effect is reported under comprehensive earnings. 

 The Faroe Islands have a nominal tax rate of 18% and a special resource tax of 4,5% from 2014 and onwards. The effective tax rate was 28,03% in 2014 due to earlier deferred taxes. I expect the effective tax rate to remain above the nominal tax rate for some time due a big deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. I expect the effective tax rate to be 22,5% in the longer run. 

 There are no non-controlling interests taking part in the profits of Bakkafrost. Furthermore there is no potential dilution from options as they are not part of the employer/executive salary package. The only potential dilution is from potential future increase of equity. Later in the cash flow section I will explain why I don’t see new equity being issued in the near future. 

 When looking at the income statement it is worth noting that in 2014 the margins were higher than the 2010-2013 average margins. As stated earlier this is attributable to the Russian situation. But it is also worth noting that the 2010-2013 margins were high even without having the effect of the Russian import ban. This shows us that Bakkafrost enjoys the gains from the Russian situation but is in no way dependent on it to survive or produce above average margins. 

 Condensing the income statement into one word I would call it “great”. 

 [Figure 8 - Balance sheet percentage change](http://i.imgur.com/mEtoqwx.png)

 [Figure 9 - Balance sheet common size](http://i.imgur.com/GGk1E1v.png)

 Looking at the balance sheet we see the numbers of a financially solid company.
 
 The “Intangible assets”-item is the first and in my opinion the most interesting item in the balance sheet. Bakkafrost writes that: “Intangible assets comprise primarily the fair value of acquired farming licenses. No licenses in the North region are recorded with a value in the Bakkafrost accounts.” This could mean that we’re looking at a sizeable hidden asset since a license to farm salmon in a given area is by no means worthless.

 First of all we have to split up the farming sites (and their farming license) into a Farming West and a Farming North region. Bakkafrost does not disclose which farming sites belong to Farming West and which ones belong to Farming North. After many hours of searching I found a semi-outdated site which lists all the Faroe fishing licenses and the owners. On figure 10 we see all Bakkafrost’s farming sites marked with circles. The yellow ones are listed on the site as belonging to “Bakkafrost Farming North” while the green ones are listed as belonging to “Bakkafrost Farming West”. The farming sites represented by red circles are listed as either belonging to just “Bakkafrost Farming” or another company from which Bakkafrost has later acquired the license. The blue line on figure 10 is my best guess at a division between the two regions. 

 [Figure 10 - Bakkafrost farming locations](http://i.imgur.com/WRwYcfR.png)

 This means that we have between eight and ten farming licenses which are recorded at a value of 0. To put a value on this hidden asset I’ll take a look at the value of the fishing licenses which are already on the balance sheet. 

 The intangible asset (worth 294,7 million DKK) is composed of at least six and up to nine farming licenses. To be conservative I’ll assume that this number is for all nine licenses potentially belonging to Bakkafrost Farming West. This means that each license is worth 294,7 million DKK / 9 = 32,7 million DKK per license. Therefore the eight to ten licenses located in the North region is worth between 261,6 and 327 million DKK. The market values Bakkafrost’s assets at 2,9 times assets. Using this as a guide, the hidden assets could be equal to 758,64-948,3 million DKK of additional market value. This is roughly 7%-9% of Bakkafrost’s current market cap. 
Given the uncertainty of the calculations made above I will not include the value of the hidden asset in my total business valuation. It is an area worthy of further research though and later on I will contact the management/IR department and ask them about it. 

 The total PP&amp;E consists of all non-financial “hard assets” in Bakkafrost. This includes the hatcheries (six), farming sites (19), wellboats (five), harvesting plants (three), offices (various sales offices and the headquarter), processing plants (two), packaging plant (one), FOF plant (one), prepayments made for several hard assets in the investment plant and various other small PP&amp;E assets such as computers, furniture etc. 

 Under the “Total non-current financial items” we have the “Investments in associated companies” and “Investments in stocks and shares” which consists of the stakes in the associated companies mentioned earlier. The long-term receivable is a minor item related to a long standing receivable with a customer. It is expected to be realized at the value stated on the balance sheet. 

 The total inventory consists of the biomass (equal to ~30% of the total assets) and other inventory. The biomass is valued at fair value and subject to an adjustment every year. The other inventory consists primarily of raw materials going into the FOF plant, packing material and semi-finished goods.

 The “total receivables”-item consists of accounts receivables and other receivables. Accounts receivables have grown far less than the total amount of assets which shows a tighter control with the account receivables. The other receivables are related to VAT, deposits for derivatives and receivables from the associated companies. 

 The cash and cash equivalent item is the bank deposits and other near-cash instruments such as short term bonds. Even with a high dividend and ambitious investment Bakkafrost has been able to build a big cash position (11,7% of total assets). I suspect that the cash position hasn’t been distributed as a dividend/buyback due to upcoming debt liabilities, future payments for the investment plan and to “buff up” the balance sheet in order to be able to withstand potential adverse industry/company specific developments. 

 Overall the total amount of assets has grown rapidly since 2010. The growth in total assets has been faster than the growth in equity because the total liabilities have been growing faster than the total assets. 

 The equity has been growing fast with no increase in the share capital. This is the result of high and fast growing comprehensive income. The equity/liabilities-ratio has been shrinking since 2010 due to new debt financing. The equity share is ~60% which I consider enough given the high amount of liquid assets, interest coverage ratio and quick ratio. 

 Long-term interest bearing liabilities (short- and long-term) consists of three different debt instruments which accounts for ~17,5% of the total equity and liabilities and 43,2% of the total liabilities. The first debt instrument is a 500 million NOK unsecured bond issued in 2013 with a five year tenor. The interest is NIBOR 3m + 4,15%. The currency has been swapped to DKK and the interest rate to CIBOR 3m due to primary exposure to DKK and EUR. The second debt instrument is an instalment loan of 500 million DKK obtained in 2011. It is payable with 25 million DKK each quarter (100 million DKK is listed as “short-term interested bearing debts”). The last debt instrument is a 600 million DKK (adjusted down to 553 million DKK after a sale of a subsidiary) overdraft facility fully payable in 2016.  

 As written earlier I suspect that the interest bearing debt is part of the reason why Bakkafrost has been building a big cash position. They have to pay back 653 million DKK in 2016, 100 million DKK (remainder of the instalment loan) in 2017 and 500 million NOK in 2018. Bakkafrost currently has 753 million DKK in available bank financing. 

 Bakkafrost has a sizeable deferred tax liability that – as noted under the income statement section – will keep the effective tax rate higher than the nominal tax rate for some time into the future. 

 The “derivatives”-item is an item related to different derivatives used in Bakkafrost. The two derivatives mentioned in the annual report are the currency-swap and the interest rate-swap related to the bond.

 In 2013 Bakkafrost decided to break the current liabilities into more sub-categories. “Trade payables” and “other current liabilities” took the place of “accounts payable and other debt” in 2013. These are small items related to bills waiting to be paid and other small, current liabilities not specified by Bakkafrost.

 In total, the amount of liabilities has been rising fast. It is however not alarming in my eyes since Bakkafrost generates huge amounts of cash through operations and have a lot of cash on hand to pay upcoming debts (see next section). 

 Overall the balance sheet and capital structure look solid to me. I do however want to keep a close eye on the development in the balance sheet when the big debt payments arrive because they arrive at a time where cash is needed for the investment plan. It should be no problem due to a high free cash flow (see next section) but it is always worth being on top of these sorts of things. 

 [Figure 11 - Cash flow statement](http://i.imgur.com/iy2Ttj4.png)

 Looking at the cash flow statement we see a flourishing company creating a solid stream of free cash flow.

 The cash flow from operations takes the operational EBIT and adds back all the non-cash charges made on the income statement such as the fair value adjustments to the biomass and depreciation charges. It has been growing very fast in the last years primarily attributable to the fast increase in operational EBIT.

 In the investment section we see the cash used in various investments. The most notable part is the massive use of money to buy or prepay PP&amp;E. This is the result of the investment plan. Worth noting is that Bakkafrost still has a lot of money left after paying for the various investments. In other words, Bakkafrost has a high amount of free cash flow which is great. The high free cash flow points in the direction of no additional equity issuance in the near future and a high sustainability of the current dividend. 

 Looking at the financing section we see that Bakkafrost has acquired extra funding through the various debt instruments mentioned in the balance sheet section. One of the main cash drainers is the high (and historically fast growing) dividend being paid. The upcoming payment of 653 million DKK will be another major cash drainer next year but Bakkafrost should have no trouble with the payment given the high free cash flow and big cash position. When some of the current interest bearing debt has been payed of I could see Bakkafrost raise the dividend aggressively or initiate a buyback program due to the high free cash flow. 

 Overall the cash flow statement supports my conclusion regarding the income statement and balance sheet. The story being told by the financial statements is that we are looking at a great company. During my analysis I discovered no suspicious accounting. From the revenue recognition practices to the assumptions used to fair value the biomass and intangible assets, everything looks okay in my eyes.

 **Dividend policy**

 The dividend is currently at 6 DKK (payout ratio of 45%). The dividend policy is to payout 30-50% of the net income. Management has said that the investment plan will not change the dividend policy. 

 As written in the last section, Bakkafrost has a high free cash flow and therefore I consider the current dividend sustainable. 

 The current dividend gives a yield of 3%. Be advised that you MIGHT experience some dividend related tax troubles depending on your location. Personally, I have to send a letter to the Faroe tax authority every year to get a tax refund on the dividend. 

 [Figure 12 - EPS DPS and Payout ratio](http://i.imgur.com/qQcxtUG.png)

 **Competitors**

 The list of competitors is composed of the other seafood companies listed on the OSE. 

 **Austevoll Seafood** is the fourth largest company in the group with a market cap of 8,5 billion NOK. Austevoll is a diversified pelagic fishery based in Norway but with operations in Chile, Norway and Peru. 

 **Grieg Seafood** is the second smallest company in the group with a market cap of 2,9 billion NOK. Grieg Seafood is a salmon and trout producer based in Norway but with operations in Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom. 

  **Lerøy Seafood Group** is the second largest company in the group with a market cap of 15,3 billion NOK. Lerøy Seafood Group is engaged in salmon farming and diversified seafood. 

  **Marine Harvest** is the largest company in the group with a market cap of 45,4 billion NOK. Marine Harvest offers a wide range of seafood. It is based in Norway but has operations in most of the major seafood countries. 

  **Norway Royal Salmon** is the third smallest company in the group with a market cap of 3,1 billion NOK. Norway Royal Salmon is a salmon and trout producer based in Norway. 

  **SalMar** is the third largest company in the group with a market cap of 14,6 billion NOK. SalMar is a salmon producer based in Norway. 

 **The Scottish Salmon Company** is the smallest company in the group with a market cap of 0,98 billion NOK. The Scottish Salmon company is a salmon producer based in Scotland. 


 To give you an idea about the relative ranking between these companies and Bakkafrost, I have chosen to compare them with the use of nine business metrics. Revenue and EBIT growth tells us something about how much the companies have grown in the recent past. EBIT margin and EBIT per kg gutted weight tells us something about how good the companies are at turning one dollar of revenue/one kg gutted fish into operating profit. ROIC and ROCE tells us something about how good the companies are at using their invested/employed capital optimal. Interest coverage and quick ratio tells us something about the companies’ financial strength. Lastly we have a dividend yield which is our direct yield of holding the investment. 

 [Figure 13 - Comparison on business metrics](http://i.imgur.com/OEprSLm.png)

 The top two in each metric is colored green and the bottom two is colored red. Looking at these business ratios, Bakkafrost is by far the best company of the group. It ranks as the best or second best in almost every ratio. In the two ratios where it doesn’t, it still has a solid position. A quick ratio of right around 2 (especially combined with the magnificent interest coverage) and a sustainable dividend yield just shy of 3% is not bad at all. 

 **Valuation**

 [Figure 14 – Relative valuation](http://i.imgur.com/g9tiOtg.png)

 Given that Bakkafrost is the best company in the comparison group (as measured by the nine business metrics) one might expect that Bakkafrost is valued relatively high compared to the others. But this is actually not the case. Looking at figure 14 we see that Bakkafrost is valued approximately in the middle of the group. It is neither cheap nor expensive measured on a relative basis. My earlier analysis points in the direction of a good future for Bakkafrost and the reasonable relative valuation could mean that we’re looking at a bargain.  

 To determine whether Bakkafrost is a bargain at the current price, I will use a Discounted Abnormal Operating Model (DAOE). This type of model is described in greater detail in “Financial Statements Analysis and Security Valuation” by Stephen Penman. It is somewhat expensive but I highly recommended it. 

 I will do a base case, optimist case (moderately optimistic, not “blue sky”) and pessimist case (moderately pessimistic, not “draconian”) valuation. The valuation will be based on a five year proforma statement for each case. The “cost of operations”/WACC is based on a “bottom up”-beta (Damodaran’s concept) with added industry specific risk. 

 The base case is built around average result from the investment plan and a moderate increase in salmon spot prices and harvest volumes

 [Figure 15 – Base case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/D4icNia.png)

 In the base case we get a fair value of 316,25 NOK per share. I consider the base case the most probable and assign it a probability of 60%. 

 The pessimist case is built on expectations of poor results from the investment plan, a moderate decrease in salmon spot prices and a constant harvest volume

 [Figure 16 – Pessimist case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/UW8ZxDa.png)

 In the pessimist case we get a fair value of 183,11 NOK per share. I consider the pessimist/optimist case the least probable and assign them both a probability of 20%.
The optimist case is built on high expectations for the investment plant and a solid increase in salmon spot prices and harvest volume

 [Figure 17 – Optimist case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/wCteyLe.png)

 In the base case we get a fair value of 395,72 NOK per share.

 Condensing the three cases into a single valuation I come up with a value of 305,5 NOK (0,60 * 316,25 NOK + 0,2 * 183,11 NOK + 0,2 * 395,72 NOK) per share. This value is 20,3% percent higher than the current price of 254 NOK. 

 **Catalysts**

 There are several different potential catalysts in the near future that can push Bakkafrost to my estimated fair value of 305,5 NOK.

 As written in the industry overview, salmon prices are expected to rise in the coming years as supply growth slows down. This is currently the biggest catalyst for Bakkafrost and I expect a strong rally as a result of great financial results if the higher spot price materializes as expected.  

 Chile is the second largest producer of salmon after Norway. The Chilean farming capacity has grown at an explosive rate in the last decade and quality/disease control has not been able to keep up with the growth. Therefore, news about adverse developments in the Chilean salmon/fishing industry such as disease outbreaks comes out every now and then. This kind of news pushes up the price of non-Chilean salmon farmers. Production problems in Chile act as a potential catalyst on non-Chilean farmers especially farmers (such as Bakkafrost) who can sell their fish to the Russian market with even less competition.

 The Russian situation is a joker in the Bakkafrost case. A step up (or prolongation) of the Russian conflict could act as a catalyst and push the stock price up but it could also hurt the investor sentiment and make investors more risk averse. 

 **Conclusion**

 Bakkafrost is a great company operating in an interesting industry which stands to benefit from limited supply growth in the short/mid-term and several megatrends in the long run. The management in place is as good as it gets and has been called the best salmon farming management team by analysts. 

 The gap up to my valuation of 305,5 NOK can be closed by several near-term catalysts. Bakkafrost is currently valued at a discount of 20,3% based on my valuation. Bakkafrost is not a deep value stock but rather a “good company at a fair price” kind of value opportunity. It is to some degree a play on the tension between Russia and the western world.

 My recommendation: **Buy**",finance,1439127407
personalfinance,How to factor in inflation when considering debts,"I understand how inflation affects investment returns. For example, if your investment grew by 10% one year, but the value of the dollar dropped by 3% during that year, then the investment only *truly* grew by 7%.


Would the same considerations apply to a debt, in that you would simply subtract off the inflation rate from the debt's interest rate in order to obtain the *true* interest rate?


Consider a hypothetical example in which you acquired a loan with 0% interest, and never made any payments on it. The principle balance would stay constant each year. Nevertheless, the ""burden"" of that debt would drop by the inflation rate each year, because it becomes a relatively lighter debt as time goes on. From a certain perspective, this seems like it amounts to an interest rate of *negative* 3% (that is, assuming an inflation rate of 3%). From this point, if you imagine increasing the nominal interest rate of the loan, you would simply add that to the baseline interest rate of –3%. Thus a loan with 5% interest *on paper* truly only amounts to a loan with 2% interest when you factor into inflation.

Does the logic check out here? Or am I looking at this situation in the wrong way?",finance,1439128706
financialindependence,Traditional 401k v. Roth 401k - clarifying questions among the debate,"Hey FI, 

I'm a long time lurker of PF, and I just discovered this sub. For the past hour or so, I've found it incredibly useful - there are some awesome subjects that PF doesn't get into, I've already subscribed! 


I read this [post]( http://www.madfientist.com/traditional-ira-vs-roth-ira/) on Mad FIentist, and it created a few questions, specifically about Roth 401ks:

* **Do Roth 401ks not lower your taxable income?** I was under the impression whether traditional or Roth, when it comes tax season, both are reported to the IRS and lower your taxable income 

* **Does State tax play a considerable part in initial Roth taxed contributions?** I never really considered the tax impact of state, only federal. This would imply if you switch jobs from somewhere like GA to NY, it would make a difference. 

* The traditional 401k has a common strategy where one could covert to a IRA, then use the Roth conversion ladder to access contributions at minimal or no penalty. **What similar strategy does the Roth 401k have?** Is it possible to convert a Roth 401k into an Roth IRA at no penalty, and withdraw after 5 years? 


Thanks!

Bitcoin,The Lawsky Attack,"The BitLicense stuff is a bitch. 

It is the result of foolish laws being written by government officials without providing a shred of representation. Infuriated by Lawsky’s bullshit in the middle of last year, I dug deep into his fiat bitlicense crap which propelled me straight into the process of lawmaking, which naturally led me to [my work on Congress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9jXrUzLOtA&amp;feature=youtu.be). 

So clearly I get a little chaffed when some say that my focus is no longer on Bitcoin. All my research on Congress focuses on the ‘Lawsky Problem’ (the lack of representation.) And while this same problem effects blacks, middle class and poor, it is also rips at those of us looking to build financial networks that sidestep fiat currencies and traditional banking. Yes Bitcoiners that’s us.

Even worse, however, was the harsh attitude my work received last week from some in the Bitcoin community, especially from those myopic individuals (racists) who perceived my last video to be entirely about race. The video may have appeared that way but it is not. 

Last week’s video was entirely about minority representation both racial **and political**. And as such, I focused directly on the corruptive elements of big banks (political enemies of Bitcoin).

So, while we Bitcoiners are a strong, highly focused group, we are also a dinky, pubic-hair sized minority being subjected to unjust legislation. And worse, our adversaries are rich and vicious.

Further, what I found, is that it is precisely because we are so small that Lawsky could just jam the Bitlicense legislation down our collective throat. 

So, we can bury our heads in the sand if we want, we can pretend that the libertarians are going to win and that tomorrow we'll never have to deal with life in a democracy, but that's just foolish. This Lawsky ‘attack’ ain't going away (there will be more such acts) and as such, I suggest that this is something we need to grapple with. And until we understand, respect and look at possible solutions for all possible attacks (a big focus of my Bitcoin work) we will be thwarting ourselves.

So yeah, I left the word ‘Bitcoin’ out of the video. Does that really mean the video doesn't deserve to be a part of my channel focusing on all things Bitcoin related? Or did it really mean that this is an issue that effects us directly, but also has a broader public appeal and by pushing Bitcoin into the conversation it just might be confusing to others?",cryptocurrency,1439138481
personalfinance,Previously owned car no longer shows on credit report,"So, my girlfriend and I bought a car back in November of 2012. First time car buyers so we knew we were somewhat screwed but wanted to build our credit so we took the loan with a high interest rate, and paid the monthly payments on time.

Fast forward to this summer. I was only working part-time, looking for full time work, and my girlfriend hadn't found any work at all, so we ended up in a crappy situation. We probably shouldn't have taken the car in the first place, since we could afford it but it was hard to save up any sort of emergency funds.

Long story short, it did eventually get repossessed. My question/concern is that the loan no longer shows on my credit report at all.

We are both going to be incoming freshmen this fall at a private university in New Orleans, Louisiana.  My tuition is fully covered, courtesy of my parents who I am blessed to have plus the presidential scholarship at the school, however my SO is not as lucky.  Both of her parents are on the verge of bankrupt and not supportive of her in any way, and really aren't of much help.  Half of her tuition is payed for with federal loans and grants due to her situation (being the daughter of a divorced couple of which one is bankrupt and the other averages sub-$20k salary per year), but it is a private institution which leaves $24,000 unpaid for.  A collection of various family members have put forth roughly $12,000 towards that $24,000, leaving $12,000 to be paid for.  However, the school charges an absurd amount if you choose to pay monthly.  Rather than the logical $1k payment for 12 months, the only option is $2.5k payments over 8 months.  She will be working to raise the money, but I highly doubt she can reach $2,500 a month while attending school.  Most every day people can't.  What suggestions do you guys have regarding how to pay that remaining $12,000?  She is willing to take out a private loan, but with no credit history at 18, people keep saying no bank will do a loan, and her parents being relatively broke won't cosign nor would it really help considering their credit history.

personalfinance,flair:Employment Finally have my “adult job!” Need help navigating benefits.,"Hello Personal Finance,

I’m a long time lurker, and am taking the plunge myself - I finally have income other than student loans. I checked the wiki to try and grasp my options, but the sheer scale of possibilities and combinations available is overwhelming. 

I am a teacher in DC and will be making approximately $54,975 yearly before tax. I am married and my wife works making about $25,000 before tax. We do not share bank accounts right now because the first time we tried the bank made it a headache. I have a WF college checking account and savings account, she has a Penfed account and WF checking account.

I will receive my master’s in education this coming May and as of today I have $48,645.10 in student loans. $5000 of that is a subsidized loan and the others have 6.8 interest rates though one has a 9 interest rate. I am taking out no more and will be paying off interest as soon as I receive my paychecks. I have started a budget with YNAB. We have only enough in the bank to get through this and next month, but I start getting paid this month. I will be in a Title 1 school and plan on teaching long enough to receive Teacher Loan Forgiveness (hopefully up to the full $17,500 forgiven).

Currently I am still under my parents’ insurance but will change that immediately. She has insurance through her work but we prefer to just add her to my new plan. We are both in good health, with no chronic conditions and in the next years we will attempt to have children. 

Our goals -
 
1) Life insurance to match our current/future situation

2) Pay off loans

3) Invest

4) Combine finances

The options are vast and dense and I am having trouble deciphering what they mean and what is relevant for our situation. From what I can tell there is no employer matching on investment?? And since the union provides dental and optical do I need overlap in plans? Should I worry about investing at all or just tackle my loans? What is the ideal amount for me to pay back on the loans to get rid of them quick while maximizing the benefit of the Teacher Loan Forgiveness after 5 years? How can we get a great bank/ credit union account for the two of us? Should I stay with WF since I’ve been there since high school?
To thicken the plot my wife has no college degrees (community college bureaucracy and futility discouraged her), but she is thinking of going back to school as soon as I finish my degree. How can we plan for that?

Now for the benefit choices:

Health insurance

HMO through Aetna, Kaiser Permanente or United Healthcare; PPO through Aetna; POS through United Healthcare; Dental and Optical through the Teacher’s Union.

Insurances

Basic Life, Supplemental Life, Accidental Death/Dismemberment, Short-Term Dis, Long-Term Dis

Other

Teacher Retirement Plan, FSA accounts, 403(b) sheltered annuities, DC Teacher Credit Union, 457 Deferred Compensation, Loan cancellation/deferment…

There are others, but are less urgent for me. [For a fuller list check here](http://dcps.dc.gov/page/compensation-and-benefits-teachers)

Now to fully see what these benefits entail, [the pdf of teacher benefits is available online here](http://dcps.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dcps/publication/attachments/2015%20Washington%20Teachers%E2%80%99%20Union%20%28WTU%29%20Employee%20Benefits%20Guide.pdf)

personalfinance,How to deduct down payment assistance from future inheritance,"My wife and I are closing on a condo on Friday. My parents offered 45k down payment assistance on the 345k condo so that we will have 25% equity in the property and be eligible for a lower interest rate. I accepted the 45k with the understanding that the amount would be deducted from my future inheritance. The 45k is currently in my parents' money market account. 


In July my parents signed a gift certification document from the mortgage lender stating that the 45k is a gift that will not be repaid as a loan. Last Friday my parents sent me a loan document to sign with an interest rate and conditions for repayment. When I reminded them that the loan document contradicted the terms of the gift certification document, they said that the loan was for tax purposes and to ensure that the 45k would be deducted from my inheritance. Although the loan document outlines an interest rate and repayment conditions, my parents said I am not expected to adhere to it whatsoever. The 45k is a gift despite the loan and the interest will be paid by them for as long as they live. The language in the loan document came from my uncle, their Edward Jones financial advisor of 30+ years, who claims this is how he gifted down payment assistance to all of his children. 



My wife and I are concerned that my parents are trying to exploit some loophole that could come back to haunt us later as tax or mortgage fraud if the IRS finds the gift certification document or the mortgage lender finds the loan document.



1. What financial incentive would my parents and their financial advisor have for setting up this fake loan that explicitly contradicts the gift certification document? I cannot tell if they are correct, blissfully ignorant of the laws, or trying to avoid some kind of tax penalty.

I was stupid and didn’t think about looking the company up or anything, just took the money and went to school. I know I screwed up…. 

I owe right at $48k on my house right now which is worth about $100-120K (5% FHA fixed loan). I have around $80k worth of student loan debt left that’s slowly killing me at a rate of $1,400/month minimum payments and an average interest rate of 9.6%. I have been thinking about refinancing my house in order to pay off a massive amount of the loans which in the end would allow me to pay off my debt faster but I’m also a little hesitant as well.

Just looking for a little advice really. I know it’s bad to convert all the unsecured debt to secured debt, but that’s generally speaking if bankruptcy is a possibility, which it is not. I know it will ding my credit history, which I am fine with since I haven’t had it check for a credit line since 2011. I know it will start my payments back for my house at month 1 of 360, which I am fine with since I plan on staying here for at least another 2-5 years.

technology,Affirm just bought LendLayer and destroyed the last great coding bootcamp financing option.,"Okay, so I was all set to attend a coding bootcamp! I was finally ready to take the plunge. You have to understand that for some of us, this is a big commitment! If you have a family, you will probably not see them for a good 3 months, because you want to make sure that your attention is 100% focused on the bootcamp. Some of us will quit our jobs to pursue a different career, not knowing if things will work out. 
Well, I did all that I quit my job, and was ready to attend a bootcamp. I was worried about the financial part, long story short, after the housing bubble, I was not able to keep making payments on my mortgage and my credit is terrible now.
Enter, Lendlayer! A startup that provides lending to students like myself. Lendlayer, rather than focusing on credit score, zeroes in on a student’s future earning potential, interest rates are driven by the bootcamp being attended, a student’s GitHub commits and his or her work experience listed on LinkedIn… That sounds fair don’t you think? They are betting that someone that is showing an interest to learn and have at least held a job in the past, might be a good investment.
Well, enter Affirm. Affirm just purchased LendLayer, and basically cancelled everyone that was approved to attend a bootcamp through LendLayer, and Affirm, unlike LendLayer will run your credit, so if you have bad credit or no credit, tough luck. 
And the worst part is, all the news that you hear about Affirm, is that they are going to make things better, here is an excerpt of an article on Fortune.com:
""Affirm, the lending startup launched by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, started offering new financing options to students attending education programs for coding, design, and business. The entry to the market is bolstered by Affirm’s announcement on Wednesday that it has acquired talent from startup LendLayer.
Expanding into educational loans makes sense for Affirm, which wants to reinvent the way people carry debt. In particular, Affirm is rethinking the way people—particularly millennials—borrow money, allowing them to obtain a micro-loan at a point of sale instead of using a credit card.""
So, I don’t understand all the praise that Affirm is receiving… if they are basically like all the other options that deny some of us, the opportunity to better ourselves….Great job Affirm!",technology,1439220532

personalfinance,Halp!,"I know I shouldn't feel this way - I should feel thankful, excited, happy, even ecstatic.  But mostly I just feel kind of numb and tired.  I woke up this morning in a cold sweat after dreaming that I'd fallen into a pit that I could only climb out of using rusty handholds that kept working their way out of the wall.  I realize I'm feeling more stressed than I'd imagined until now.  Part of it is that I don't really have any friends or relatives I feel comfortable talking to about this.  Even my spouse, although of course we are both involved in this.  Well, here goes with the throwaway, /r/personalfinance.

So, the situation is, I -- we -- just suddenly got kind of wealthy.  No, not ""private jet"" wealthy, not by any means, but still: we went overnight from having a comfortable few hundred thousand dollars in the bank to having millions.  Not the lottery or an inheritance or anything like that; I ""earned"" it fair and square (well, insofar as anyone can be said to ""earn"" that kind of money), so it wasn't entirely unexpected, but the rapidity of the events that triggered the payoff still left me a little breathless.

I suck at managing my money, and my spouse is no better.  I mean, don't get me wrong, we're reasonably careful about spending, don't live beyond or even too close to our means, pay our bills in full each month; no problems with elementary stuff like that.  But we don't enjoy thinking about money, and we're the kind of people who'll leave a big chunk of cash in a checking account just because it's too much of hassle to spend time thinking about interest rates and CDs and stuff.   Neither of us likes uncertainty, and the one time we made a tiny foray into the stock market, the shares we bought promptly crashed and we decided to hold them in case they recovered in the long term -- then ended up losing it all because we stopped paying attention and the online brokerage we used instituted a quarterly inactivity fee and sold all the shares one by one to pay the fee.  So that's about where we stand with investment experience.

Naturally I'm glad, in an abstract sense, that we now have a lot of money.  It's very reassuring to know that I don't have to worry unduly about the family's financial future.   FDIC insurance limits aside, even with the low prevailing interest rates, we could theoretically put it all into some bank and live (frugally) off the interest, provided that is that we remembered to transfer it from checking into savings :-)  But obviously, we need to be more sophisticated about it than that.  I have no intention of retiring any time soon and my earned income is sufficient to support our lifestyle.  This ""windfall"" should be allocated properly in a diverse portfolio and invested long term so it can blah blah blah blah blah.. sorry; I'm finding it hard to get enthusiastic about the prospect of getting more sophisticated.  Honestly, it fills me with a dull sense of dread.

And then, since we have been blessed with offspring, there's the next generation to think about: education, trusts, inheritance taxes, ... obviously this stuff has to be done competently, but it involves thinking about old age and death and stuff, which doesn't exactly brighten my mood.

I guess my real question is: how can I regain my sunny outlook?  And how do I deal properly with this: ensure that the money is invested properly so as to ensure the future security of the family, while not having it take over my life?  Lots of sources advise staying away from Wall Street investment managers with their hefty fees (1% of assets under management -- regardless of performance -- seems typical) but, honestly, I feel like it might be worth the fees to make the problem (of thinking about it) ""go away.""  Problem is, I suspect, based on my minimal experience with Wall Street, that they might very well make the money ""go away"" too.  Obviously I need to pay at least some attention....",finance,1439228175
personalfinance,Buy a House in 4 Months or Wait 16 Months?,"I'm in a bit of a fight with myself on when is the right time to buy a property.

My wife and I currently have 20k saved up for a house down payment. We're investing 20% of our income and already have about a 4 month emergency fund. For the last year or so, we've been saving $1000/month, plus 3rd paychecks in a month (both paid biweekly), plus tax refunds for a home down payment. The lease on our apartment is up on December 31, so we are beginning to think about what we want to do next. We know we want to leave our current apartment for either a home or a slightly nicer apartment with central air conditioning (currently have a window unit that doesn't cut it).

A decent starter home that we'd want to live in comes in around 200k or so, so a 20% down payment would require 40k. As mentioned previously, we have about 10% available right now specifically for a home down payment. We also have emergency funds, car replacement funds, travel, retirement, etc. but wouldn't feel comfortable raiding that for a down payment. We are currently debt free although we both drive old cars so if they both decide to die around the same time we may need to take out 1 car loan. Long story short, we have enough for a 10% down payment. We would probably have 13-14% come January 1, 2016.

Based on the little research I've done, our options are:

1. Raid all additional funds to get to 20%
2. Piggyback 80-10-10 loan
3. Pay PMI for 2 or so years until we can drop it by aggressively putting more money into mortgage.
4. Sign a 12 month lease and rent for 1 more year.

Obviously the pros of buying in a couple months would be not dumping ~$12k into rent in 2016 and locking in a low interest rate on a 15 year mortgage. The pros of waiting would be taking out a smaller mortgage, but the con is the home and interest prices could go up which would affect what homes we could afford. I would definitely have buyers remorse if interest rates are 5% in 16 months versus the 4% rates that are available now.

Would like to get some opinions form a third party. I don't want to make a dumb decision. Is it smarter to save up that bigger down payment for a home purchase in January 2017 or does it make sense to buy in January 2016? Additionally, are there any downsides to getting approved for a mortgage now, looking at homes, and then deciding to rent for another year instead?

When we were moving in the tenant said that everything was fine and that he had permission from the Landlord, a month later he tells us that he didn't actually tell the landlord nor did he intend to as to not pay more money to the Council Tax. My fiancee and I were trying to find another place to live and being in London, that proved to be very difficult, but in the end we managed. Initially he asked me to give him a month notice as to when we move out but we found another place the actual moving date was in 3 weeks time. He made a big fuss how we didn't give him the professional courtesy of informing him sooner. (we had only just found out ourselves that owner of the new place gave us the OK on moving in) We told him that he can take the fourth week out of the deposit and pay us back the rest, he counter offered that we should pay half of the rent and he will give us our deposit later. After we threatened to get the police involved and informing his landlord, he caved and said he will give us the money in full but he has yet to pay us back. The day we moved out he said he would contact us in the following days regarding our deposit and when he will pay it back, a month has passed since then. So I sent him a letter of warning, on the 31st of July and that he has until the 11th of August to pay us back our deposit, on which laws he's broken and that if do not receive our deposit back minus the fourth week , we will take him to small court. When I delivered the letter by hand, I noticed he was home because his window was open and the car was there(he lives alone seeing he sent his wife back in Romania and that he hasn't found any other suckers to replace us.). Now I got a text from him saying that he just got our letter,that he just got back in London and that he would like to meet us and talk about giving us our deposit back. I don't really trust him and am concerned about him hurting us physically but I could tell him that I'm busy with double shifts at work, which is true, and that I can talk over the phone. I am most likely forgetting something but this is the gist of things.

Some background information on this person: He is a egotistical man with a tendency to drink a lot and smoke weed. He is a degenerate that's going through a mid-life crisis. While we were living together with him and his family,wife and kid, he sold his family friendly car to buy a sports car so he can start racing on the streets. He sends his wife and back to their home country, every time he sick of them and unbeknownst to his wife, he brings strange women into the house and tries to sleep with them. How do I know about this? Besides the fact that the loud mouth enjoys bragging in front of myself and my fiancee, he takes little effort to hide these dubious acts from us. My fiancee and I got fed up with his lies and constant drinking and just tried to get away from him as soon as possible. We could have waited a month but this man... just makes it impossible to calmly talk things out. When we first met him, he seemed like a nice person which is why we were so trusting, our mistake. My apologies any mistakes or if I seem a bit rushed.

My questions are: 1. If in the end he lies again about wanting to pay the deposit back, should I take to small court? /note We don't have a signed agreement, it was all verbal and we only have the bank pay slip from when we sent him the money initially. 2.Are there any other options to consider for getting back our deposit?",finance,1439231805

I've been a long time lurker and love reading the posts here and learning from them!

Some background:
Currently I'm an engineer that started a couple weeks ago at a large company in the Bay Area making about $89,000/year (before taxes). I have about $6,000 in savings and an additional $5,500 in a Roth IRA that I contributed to last year. My company also matches up to 4.5% dollar for dollar for 401k and I'm maxing that out. I'm also expecting to receive $8,000 as a sign on bonus in my next paycheck in addition to my regular pay. I'm considering if I should pay off the as much of my student loan as possible with the 8k and my savings in order to get the debt off my back (peace of mind) but I'm hesitant as that would leave me with no emergency fund and I'd still like to contribute to my Roth IRA. 

Originally I had $29,000 in student loans and I paid off about $10,000 since graduating from savings I collected from previous internships and side jobs, leaving me with $19,000. I've been making monthly payments on the remaining until I decide what the best option is.

Car Lease: $357/month
Car Insurance: $150/month

Eating out: $100/month

Right now my thought process is that I should pay off the 5% student loan in its entirety immediately and maybe a portion of the smaller interest rate loans in and leave the rest for monthly payments. Would that be a wise thing to do? Or is it better to leave these student loans around in order to continue building credit and leave the money available for other investments such as my Roth IRA?

As someone who just got out of college, I want to make sure I take the best course of action so I was wondering what input you guys might have on this situation.

stocks,An important message for people in $GTATQ!,"Hi,

Having spoken to multiple people who have personally interacted with the presiding Judge Henry J. Boroff during these proceedings, believe that the Honorable Judge is interested in preserving shareholders value so long as there is righteous, legal, and clear cause to do so.

There is a pending hearing on the 27th of August 2015 for what will likely be the final opportunity for Shareholders (termed in federal bankruptcy cases as ""Equity Security Holders"") to achieve representation during this case!

From my experience face-to-face with the parties to this case (GTAT -- termed, ""the Debtors"", The Bondholders (termed, ""the creditors""), and the presiding judge, it is certain that letters to the court in support of the Equity Security Holder's petition for the appointment of a Committee of Equity Security Holders  will create a bigger opportunity for such a committee to be formed!

You as a shareholder of GT Advanced Technologies, et al. will then have paid legal representation during these hearings.

We all know that Tom Guttierrez shockingly and suddenly retired today because he doesn't want to be called to the stand to testify if an Equity Holders committee is created.

But that does not protect us equity security holders from getting slaughtered if we fail to support the legal professionals, investment analysis profesionals, and volunteer team of equity holders who are working to get us paid representation.

personalfinance,Should I trade my car for something cheaper?,"Hey Reddit I have recently really started to crack down on managing my money and wanted some advice. In 2013 I bought a new Honda Accord EXL for ~ $25,000. I put down $5000. Two months prior I had gotten a job with a salary of $38,000 and thought I could afford it. Being stupid I bought the Accord put about $5k down and financed the rest with a 1.2% interest rate for 60 months. At the time I did not have a lot of bills and was living comfortably until about a year ago when I started paying my student loans. 


As of today these are my monthly expenses

Rent - $350 (Live with my girlfriend at one at my parents townhouse they rent out to us)

Car loan - $371 (2013 Honda Accord EXL, remaining payment $11929)

Student loans - $200 ($22,244 remaining, started at ~$31,000)

Groceries - $200 (Goes on capital one credit card)

Car Insurance - $160 (At fault accident 4 years ago which is why its so high)

Gas - $120 (Goes on capital one credit card)

House utilities/supplies - $100

Going out - $100  (Goes on capital one credit card)

Phone - $50 - T-mobile unlimited LTE everything, discount through my employer

Mefa loan - $50 

Gym - $30 

Netflix - $7

Spotify - $5

Total ~$1700

As of now my salary is $51,000. I take home about 2,800 a month. I also contribute to my employers 401k and roth ira. I should be seeing a 10% raise by October as I am eligible for a higher pay grade. I got Mint about 2 months ago and realized how much I was spending going out and buying things totaled up to about ~$600 a month. I've gone on vacations when I shouldn't have had. With budgeting I cut that down to about $100 a month going out and I don't plan on taking any vacations soon.


The past two months I kept to this budget listed above and have saved up $1800. Right now I have $3100 in my savings account. I want to get it to $10,000 to cover 6 months of bills, should get there in about 6/7 months maybe sooner. Once I have that 6 month emergency fund I will start tackling my student loans a lot more. I'm going to try and put about $800 more a month towards it to give a total payment of $1000 a month. If I do this I should pay off my loans in about 2 years.


So back to my car. I know $370 a month is too high right now for me. I owe $11,900 on it and have about 2 1/2 years left to pay it off. I've been debating on trading it in and getting something that will cost me less. The only thing is I know Accords are excellent and reliable cars. Does it make sense to get rid of it if I plan on keeping it 10+ years or until it dies. It's very reliable gets great gas mileage, right now averaging 31mpg. My commute is 20 miles each way. My uncle has a 2001 Accord with over 200k miles on it and its still running strong and he says he hasn't had a car payment in 10 years, which must be nice. But if I trade it in I would get something that would cost a lot less per month. 


So what to do Reddit? Is it smart to just keep the Accord or get something used and lower my monthly payment? I also need something reliable. If I get a different car I want it to last me 8+ years. I've been thinking about Honda Civics, Mazda 3s and Ford Focus Also any other advice on my finances are welcomed.",finance,1439236725

personalfinance,Should wife stop contributing to retirement?,"Short history. After I complete school we will have a combined debt of about 200,000 @ 6.8% and be making a combined income of about 113,000. After taxes and expenses, we will have enough money left over to pay the debt off in a little under four years, but I am wondering if it makes sense for my wife to keep contributing to her retirement. She receives a match of up to 7% of her income so it feels like free money, but without it she could be bringing in around an additional 250 dollars a month. Currently she is contributing 7%, so a combined total of 14%, which will be vested in the next 2 years or so. 

Thinking about the long long term, stopping this contribution does not make much sense, but considering our interest rate is higher than her growth in the account (5.3% over the last two years not counting the contribution), it also feels like the money could be better spent. 

I should add that we would send any money not going to retirement towards the debt.",finance,1439239938

personalfinance,Buying a home for the first time. Can someone please calm my nerves...?,"Long term girlfriend and I are buying our first home. Here's a breakdown:

Combined salary: ~$160k
Monthly take home: ~$9.5k
Combined retirement: $80k
Liquid cash: $115k
Combined debt: $2000 (all me, 0% promotional credit card with about $1k left and a $1k student loan at 2% APR)

We qualified for a 30 year fixed with a 3.75% APR. 

We are buying a house in a crazy market where typical Dave Ramsey's rules don't quite make the most sense for everyone but we're trying hard to follow his advice. However, we are deviating and I'd like someone not involved in this transaction to say we're doing it wrong or not to worry...

Anyway, the house is just under $500k. We're putting 15% down - hear me out though. We'll have about $35k-$40k leftover after closing for any improvements/work/furnishing/emergencies which is sort of my feel-good measure. Putting 20% down is absolutely feasible but I'm afraid our emergency funds would be a little too tight for comfort. Once we see how much we actually need set aside, we plan on dropping a check in the amount necessary to bump us up to 22% equity to avoid PMI. This could be a week after closing or a year or so... We're cool paying $150/mo for the peace of mind knowing we have enough to pay for any repairs that come our way and don't need to hit the pause button on our lifestyle. 

Based on this, our mortgage (principal, interest, homeowners insurance and PMI) is going to be a little below $2500/mo. This has us right at the ""25% of monthly take home"" rule. While I'm just under 25%, she is closer to 26% but I'm not going to argue over a few decimals. We're around 17-18% of our gross salary if that matters. We calculate MTH as gross monthly salary minus taxes/Medicare/SS/dental/vision/health. All retirement (including 401(k)), bills, savings, etc is **not** included in MTH. 

We are buying this house with the idea that this is going to be where we raise our future kids. With interest rates so low, it made sense to get a little more than we need now so we're ready in the future. Plus this market is growing at a crazy rate and $500k today may only buy us a $400k home in the next few months/years. Also, both of us are relatively young and have plenty of growth potential in our careers. That 25% will be less and less each year, assuming taxes don't go through the roof. 

Are we biting off more than we can chew? I was paying $1250/mo in rent alone before she moved here to be with me, so I'll essentially be paying exactly what I have been the last year anyway.  I was fine then, but this is just so much of a commitment and there are so many hidden costs for first time homeowners. 

Just want some general unbiased advice on the house purchase... Thanks!

personalfinance,21 M got my first credit card help me crystallize some information,"I looked at the side bar and read the credit card information. It was very informative, but I have a few questions.

I know that I don't have to pay credit cards interest rate to increase my credit score, instead I should pay what the balance is on my statement. 

1)
Question. What is a statement? How will I get it? Is it possible to check online? I still dorm in school, so things get lost in the mail often.

2)
I thought I had no credit score since I have never paid any bills myself. I have a bunch of student loans that I got from salie mae( I believe. They're all federal loans), but I have not paid any of it off yet. Why do I have a credit score of 693? This information came from  the envelope discover sent me with the new debt card. Also is 693 good or bad?

3) what pitfalls should I look out for with a credit card? My mom is an immigrant from a poor country, so it's not like I can look to her for advice, and both my brother and sister make horrible financial decisions. It's safe to say my family knows very little about money, other than how to spend it.

4) I plan on using my credit card for small purchases that I would normally buy with my debt card. (Trips to the movies, video games, restaurants, subway tickets) is this a bad move, or should I use my credit card for my occasional big purchases, and pay it off over the course of a month or two.

So I guess this question is:

Does what I purchase with my credit card, &amp; how much I use it, affect how my credit score will increase? (Ex if I pay off $300 every 3 months is that better than paying off $40 every month?)

My credit limit is $750 &amp; cash is $500. How are these two numbers different, and how do they relate to how I spend money?  How do I access them, and which is better to use if there is a difference?",finance,1439241458
personalfinance,How can I use my current good situation to leverage against the mistakes of the past?,"I'm 28, in a committed relationship with my girlfriend (26). We have a daughter (5) together. We're both working and our take home pay is roughly twice our monthly bills. She's recently leveled with me about some very poor spending habits which I won't go into now, but would leave us more or less broke at the end of each month. I took control of my family's finances shortly thereafter, and she's been more than accommodating. That said, I don't feel like I have a good road map of where to go from here.

The household take-home pay is roughly 1.5x what our (bare minimum) living expenses are. We're putting $300-$400/mo in savings, and the balance (~$700) is going towards paying down overdue balances on utilities that weren't being taken care of in months prior, as well as niceties and (Netflix, an evening or two out a week, Starbucks, etc).

I'm debt-free except for a secured credit card I keep paid current to help build my almost non-existent credit. She owes a few thousand in federal student loans, but unfortunately tens of thousands of dollars to medical bills that we're well underneath. Her wages are being garnished for this ~$60k in medical debt.

The big kicker is that I have not filed taxes in recent memory. I think the last tax return I filed was 2007. I don't really know how to approach this, so far delinquent. Other than late penalties, I doubt I will owe much money. When I stopped filing it was because I was unemployed the whole year, in a bad place emotionally, and couldn't bring myself to submit a form basically saying ""I made zero dollars this year.""

My girlfriend has been strongly considering bankruptcy to get out from underneath the medical debt, but she also did not file taxes for 2015 and the attorney she scheduled a meeting with said that would hold up the process. As I recall, she owed over $1500 to the Feds which we were at the time very unable to pay.

I'm really just looking for advice on how to proceed. Our income is at the point that we don't *have* to worry about money, except that we have the mistakes of our past looming over us. I'm confident in my ability to budget for our household and her sincere penitence that our financial situation won't deteriorate from here. However I don't know how to approach bankruptcy and filing years of late tax returns, especially since I don't have much of the figures I would even need (two of the companies I worked for in the past 8 years have since folded, for instance!)

I started off my adult life by completing nuking my credit. Had a couple cards payed them for a while and just stopped. Mix that with a few other bad decisions and here I am. 519 credit score with no credit accounts. Most of the negatives on my CR are gone now or almost gone.

In two weeks I will be starting college at a 2 year school. I received a grant to cover my tuition and will be taking out a federal loan to help buy what I need to get started.

I plan on taking $500 of my loan and getting a secured credit card. Which i will use only for gas on a weekly basis and pay it off every month.

My thinking is with my loan and secured card that is going to something on credit report and two different types of credit at that. 6 months from now I hope the secured card will allow me to get approved for something like a Kohl's Card which will add to my credit report and that will be something that will be used sparingly.

Will this plan be something that could make it possible for me to getting approved for a home loan? (either fha or conventional)

2. Secured CC ($500 limit)
3. Department store CC
4. A year's worth of mixed credit and good payments and utilization

stocks,The Long &amp; Short of It - Trading Strategies,"Hey guys, [new article here](http://pot-stocks.com/the-long-and-short-of-it/). Text below for you non-clicking heathens. If you enjoy, be sure to subscribe.
---

When you begin to invest, one decision you will need to make is whether you want to invest short-term or long-term, or both. Either way can satisfy different goals. Both have benefits and rewards, and both can lose you money if you don’t understand the strategies behind them. They are similar of course in that you are putting your money somewhere in hopes that it will increase in value by the time you need it. Both require knowledge of the investment, but short-term investing requires knowledge of the marketplace too. Although the lines can sometimes blur between them, you might distinguish them by considering long-term as investing and short-term as trading.

Long-term stocks are ones you would hold on to for a year or more, maybe even many years, gradually earning over time. These have the potential to grow considerably, especially if you gradually add to your shares and the share price increases. Long term can even provide an income once the investment grows. These demand research so you know they are good companies and able to grow over time; however, once you invest in them, you need to follow them and track them to make sure they remain that way.

Short-term stocks are ones you would hold for less than a year, maybe even a few weeks and try to earn in a shorter time frame. Hopefully the stock will earn the amount you need within that time because the earnings period is somewhat fixed and future performance has to fall within that frame. Short-term stocks may or may not grow continuously over a long period, but they may earn money within a short period if you follow their cycles of rising and falling price. You can reap short-term earnings by buying when prices are down and selling when prices are up. (This same strategy can be used for long-term investment for protection of your principal.)

You don’t want to invest long-term in large sums just because you saw radical spikes or dips on the chart that occurred in a short period, like one or two days, but you might try buying or selling in the short-term based on them. Your trading frequency as well as your risks will increase, compared to long-term investing. Short-term trading of small-cap stocks can be very tricky for the novice. If you don’t understand why the chart is moving, you won’t be able to follow it to do shorter trades. Keep in mind that the shorter the return time you place on potential earnings, the more vigilant you will have to be to profit from it. Even the long-term stocks go up and down so you don’t want the down period to eclipse your anticipated earnings time frame.

The problem in the cannabis sector is that share prices may not be moving up and down for the right reasons. The sector cannot grow freely like other industries until federal legalization. It can’t attract large investors like other sectors because many of the companies are small and so are their share prices. On one hand this is a great time to enter, with caution and study, because the entire industry has fallen to a very low and reasonable price level after a huge explosion in early 2014. On the other hand it attracts opportunists and carpetbaggers because the reporting requirements are less restrictive at the OTC level where almost all of them trade. Behind the scenes selling and buying is not uncommon and can affect the share price. The dips and spikes here might reveal nothing more than money exchanging going on between a few of the deeper pocket investors.

So long-term investment research here would help for both long- and future short-term gains, but be patient about jumping into the short-term trading aspects of the market until you learn about the companies and more about how the market moves—not because you can’t earn money in the short-term but because the short-term gains in this sector might be artificially pumped and share prices could be moving around for reasons other than the functioning of the business.

The best you can do at the early stage of investing is focus on the legitimacy of the company and the overall quality of its business model. The amount of research needed to just vet the scams and dubious ventures in this sector would still give you valuable information, mainly that the company is not a fraud, has a real product, real business plan, and maintains transparency. Focus on that first. Once you find a few good companies you can then follow their price ebb and flow and consider them for shorter investment periods.

Either investment approach requires more study than what one can learn from a single column like this, but start with important simple distinctions like these and then refine that knowledge. It is important not to mistake one approach for the other, since that could lead to disastrous results and a loss of capital. There could be some companies that are not worth a long-term investment, but this might not be good for your short-term strategy either.

You may have to adjust your research priorities in the cannabis sector, but it helps to educate yourself first about what could be the biggest potential loss to your investment. Learning to trade with dubious company shares might not be the best way to really learn trading. Some of these companies may not even be around very long. In time the sector will stabilize and this information may not remain relevant; however, by the time this sector cleans up and increases the number of really good and growing companies, as it most definitely will, you should be in a better position. That’s the real long and short of it.

personalfinance,"Mother didn't file fafsa, lost scholarship and any federal loans. Need Advice","I created a throwaway because I realize it is against the law to have a parent fill out fafsa. 

I will also preface this with the fact that I have never filed my own fafsa, and have always left it up to my mother. 

Some background info
I am going into my junior year of college. I have a full tuition scholarship. The scholarship covers tuition, but I am left on my own for lab fees, books, and room and board. 

My mom has always filed my fafsa because it was more convenient for her to deal with the financial aid aspects of this. I also have managed to avoid loans due to the fact that I am only paying $10,000 a year and am luckily enough to have a family that can afford that. 

So what happened?
I came back from a weekend away and my mom greeted me with the news that she had forgotten to file the fafsa this year. She said she opened the bill from my school and was surprised to realize it read the full amount of tuition and board instead of tuition + board - tuition that we were used to. Apparently because she had not filed the fafsa the school did not provide any aid, including the merit based scholarship. I also do not have access to federally subsidized student loans because the fafsa was not filed. I may have to take this semester/year off because there is no way i can afford to pay for a full year without my scholarship, however I am afraid that if I take it off I will lose my scholarship.   I will try to put relevant information here but feel free to ask any questions, and i could really use some advice.

personalfinance,Should I pay down student loans or build an emergency account first? I think I may have gotten myself in trouble by paying down TOO much of my student loans.,"Hi PF,

I'm trying to figure out the most prudent way to manage my finances. I'm primarily concerned with the safety net vs. student loans debate- but other advice is certainly warranted. I'm also interested in trying to add to my IRA a little each year and budget for travel. 

Debts: 
Student Loans: $3,031 @ 6.9% interest. I've paid down $45,000 in the last couple years, so my next payment is technically not due until 2021. 
Emergency Loan from Parents: $1,000. Recent. I had a cash crunch and am technically at a 0% interest rate, but I want to pay it back as soon as possible. I don't like owing family money. 

Car repair: I backed into a pole at low speed and I've been quoted $1,000 for body work. I need to do this this year. I've been holding off for 6 months.

Regular Expenses: 
Car: $229/month lease (up in 2018)
Insurance: $~1400/year. Just paid my 6 month premium last week. 
Apartment+Utilities: ~$1,100/month. The actual lease is $1,950, but I split rent. I live in an expensive city. There are not cheaper options. I promise. 

Groceries,Food,Entertainment: ~$400/month

Credit cards: No debt. I just moved into a new place, had to buy furniture, and currently owe $1,800 dollars on two cards, which I will fully pay off on the 7th of next month. I have never failed to pay down my cards in full each month and have excellent credit. 

Healthcare/insurance: No expenses. Covered by the university. I do pay around $200/year for contacts and around $100/year in co-pays. I'm also overdue for a dental appointment and am worried that I may have a cavity or two that need fixing. I have dental insurance (delta dental) but am worried this won't cover the cost. 

Travel: $1,000 - $2,500/year. While this is not a required expense, I view travel as an important part of life. I try to plan a trip to coincide with international conference travel, so my main ticket is paid for. I'd really like to keep this luxury in the mix- it really does make life more enjoyable. 

Income: 

PhD student: $28,000/year. Importantly, my take-home (net) is $2,700/month during the summer. The next two months will be $2,700. October-June will be take home of $1,497. I need to prepare for the lean times ahead. 

Tutor: Variable. I average ~$22,00/year, but my pay can vary from $300 - $3,500 depending on the month. I've been in a dry spell lately- around $700/month, but things will kick up during the school year. Most importantly, I don't want to ever HAVE to tutor a lot to pay my bills. Research could easily require that I cut back, or the company I work through could go under and I'd be forced to take another tutoring job at much lower starting pay. 

Assets: (few) 
IRA: $1,030
Savings: $300
Checking: $1,600

A few notes: I think I was too aggressive paying down student loans last year. I didn't anticipate several major expenses involved in moving into my new place, or the need for car repairs. I've had to borrow money from my parents to deal with the cash crunch for the first time in years. I don't want to have to do this again. 

I made a mistake leasing a new car (Accord) last year rather than buying a beater. While I need a car to do my tutoring job, and a few hours a week of tutoring easily covers my car payment, I didn't anticipate the insurance cost. I didn't have a car for a few years and therefore didn't have insurance. I didn't realize that this would hurt me on the other side. I'm not sure that this situation can be changed though, and I do love the car. 

I know my grocery/entertainment costs are too high- but frankly I want to enjoy living life. I should budget better, but don't realistically think I can get this under $300/month. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm just trying to figure out a plan that gives me the most security/stability without leaving me with a huge pile of bills later on.",finance,1439248072

personalfinance,"Minor with $100,000 in confirmed Life Insurance payout. What to do for the best payout in the extended future?","Throwaway for obvious reasons, and the post will be quite ambiguous (the point should still come across). I'm a minor (read: under the age of legal majority) who has recently received the confirmation of the life insurance payment for a family member that passed away recently. Being a minor, this money will be under the control of my executor or administrator until the time I become of the age of legal majority, at which point the money will be under my control. Currently, there is a guaranteed annual interest rate of 2.0% on the amount.

I have absolutely no desire to waste any of this money. The most likely scenario is that I will have to use this money to pay for my post-secondary education. However, I want to put this money to work for me in the future, as I know such a large quantity can grow quickly if the right things are done with it.

My question is, what should I do with this money so that it's as useful for me as possible in the future (think: longterm). Save in the highest guaranteed interest rate I can find? Being a minor I have no financial skills and with this news I plan to get much, much better financial skills.

Thank you.

Primary residence: $650,000 - No mortgage.   
Cash: $140,000  
Total: 1,750,000 - 495,000 = $1,255,000  

Interest rate on investment mortgages is 4.5%p.a  
Rental return on investment properties is 4.8%pa  
My holding costs of both properties totals only $70/ month or so.  

As i have quite a substantial amount of cash sitting in an offset account on the mortgages, an a considerable salary income that i cant rely on, as it's fickle contract work.

 I am wondering with such a low interest rate on the mortgages (for Australia), is there a better option for growing for my cash &amp; equity that would perform safely better than the 4.5%pa interest saving over the short term?

personalfinance,"New job, 401k rollover question.","Got laid off a few months ago, and started a new job recently. I won't have the ability to invest into a 401k for a few months, but it won't be as good or have as many options as what my previous company offered.I want to transfer the 401k into an IRA, (ROTH IRA?),  but am confused by any required fees to transfer it over. 

The 401k is at Charles Schwab, and there's two things in the faq section that seem to contradict each other. First, the description says this:

&gt;""A Rollover IRA is an account that allows you to move your assets from a qualified employer-sponsored retirement plan (such as a 401(k) plan) by “rolling over” the funds into an IRA. A Rollover IRA preserves the tax-deferred status of your retirement assets, allowing you to avoid current taxes and early withdrawal penalties on payouts you receive from your employer’s retirement plan when you change jobs or retire.""

Specifically mentioning that it preserves the tax-differed status and you don't pay additional fees/ penalties. However, further down the page, this quote seems to completely undo what was mentioned before, stating that the rollover is reported to the IRS. 

&gt;A rollover is when you move funds from one eligible retirement plan to another, such as from a 401(k) to a Rollover IRA. Rollover distributions are reported to the IRS and may be subject to federal income tax. A transfer of assets is when you move funds between two accounts of the same type, such as from one Traditional IRA to another Traditional IRA. Transfers can take place as often as you like. They are not reported to the IRS because you never take possession of your money.

I don't need this money, and don't see needing it any time soon. I do not want to get access to it. I just want to know what I can do with it and give the least of it up. Transferring to another 401k is not currently possible, and even when it is, the funds are not as good as the ones I currently have access to at Charles Schwab. I have read the sidebar dealing with 401k transfers and rollovers, however my question is more specifically about how much I pay depending on what I choose to do. Thanks Reddit!",finance,1439254920
personalfinance,Debating whether to pay off student loans fast or maxing 401(k) + IRA,"This is my first time posting here, so sorry if things may seem a little messy. I'm 22 and got a job making 70k/year pre-tax and I'm debating whether or not I should pay off my student loans as fast as possible or maxing out my 401(k) and IRA (also should I get Roth or traditional). Here are my ""stats"":



Student Loans: $28,000 (4.5% interest)

Cash: $17,000 

Essential Expenses |Monthly Budget
---|---
Rent | $180 (will increase to ~$400 in a year)
Food | $300
Car related| $300 (no car payments)
Health Insurance | $220
**Total**|**$1,000**

I've read here that a 4.5% interest rate on a loan is relatively low, so not a high priority to pay off asap. I am afraid that if I invest a lot of my money in a 401(k), it will not grow more than 3%/yr in the first few years (just my forecasting) so putting that money towards my student loans would be more beneficial, safe, and less stressful. My company will match 4% for my 401(k) so that's the minimum I'll put into it. I'm fine w/ having $17,000 for my emergency fund. Here's what I'm leaning towards doing:

Allocations | Monthly Total | Yearly Total
---|---|---
Student Loans | $1,300 | $15,600 (loan paid off after 2 yrs)
401(k) | $250 | $3,000 (~4% income)
Roth IRA | $460 | $5,500
HSA | $155 | $1,850 (company will give additional $1,500/yr)
**Total**| **$2,200**|**$26,000**

A rough estimate of a monthly paycheck of $4,000 after taxes will mean that after all necessary expenses and retirement/loan payments I'll have around $800/month for various other expenses. Then after I pay off my loans I can max out my 401(k) every year. Is this a good plan of attack or am I missing something blatantly obvious?

personalfinance,Strange question on Taxes and Citizenship (foreign) - might be hard to answer,"Hello all,

I have been trying to figure this out but it's not easy.  Let me give you the quick background.  Me, US Citizen, working abroad (Europe), for past 5 years.  I have a special legal tax status granted to certain foreigners where I do not have to pay the majority of the foreign country's taxes.  This tax status saves me about **€1,500** per month in *additional* taxes.  This is quite a significant advantage.  Of course there is also a tax treaty with the US so there is no double taxation.


To remain in this tax status I need to be able to prove (upon demand) that my ""center of economic influence"" is in the US.  In other words, I need to always have significantly more financial assets outside of the foreign country than inside.  It does not have to be in the US, just outside of the country where I live.  I also have to show that I have no intention of settling down inside of the country.  This stipulation precludes me from buying real estate and therefore I rent.  My rent is about **€1300** per month.


I used to send Euros back to my US bank account (in the form of US$).  Now, with the exchange rate situation, I just let them sit in my local bank account.  Foreigners are not allowed to invest locally.  Eventually I will have to do something with them as they are just stockpiling in there as I am fairly well paid, and I live frugally.  Barring any future change in the interest rates I could buy property in another part of Europe.  I am not keen on owning property however due to growing up in a family where we owned an apt building – it was a hell of a lot of headaches.


Now on to my question…One option I have is to become a citizen (I am already a permanent resident and qualified) and forego my special tax status.  I would be subject to the extra taxation (which really provides no additional benefit that I do not already have) if I do that.  But, then I could buy a house, saving the €1,300 rent.  I would then also be able to invest locally.  I am fluent in the local language/customs and can see myself staying long term.


Further information:  I have zero debts, live frugally, have an emergency fund, fully invested in IRA and local retirement plan.


Options:

* Give up my tax status so that I can buy a house considering that the cost of rent that I would save is only slightly less than the extra tax I would have to pay.

* Buy property in another European country  - even though it can be tough to administer from afar.

* Continue to stockpile Euros in the hopes that exchange rates return to historical norms.

* Bite the bullet and send them to my US account now.",finance,1439285398

What’s next for oil?

  In more exciting news, nobody seems to have a clue what’s happening with oil. That’s according to Ben Kumar, investment manager at Seven Investment Management, who thinks that oil is falling off a cliff and taking gold and commodities with it. With no move in OPEC, technical analysts are still increasingly moving in favour of oil prices falling towards $35, as it enters the no man’s land of sub-$40. While a resurgence could see huge profits garnered from Russian bonds, which are not-so-coincidentally linked to oil performance, there are no guarantees as oil imports across the majority of Asia have fallen. 

	
Yuan direction for Chinese currency

  However the Asian continent is facing bigger problems than oil, as the stall in the Chinese economy is having a knock on effect on other Asian currencies, and the global markets. Rather than taking the obvious approach of allowing their currency to float freely, China has begun dipping its toes into the FX markets, causing instability. A managed float, allowing 2-way volatility, would be a step in the right direction, says Jeremy Stretch – Head of G10 FX Strategy at CIBC. While their currency would devalue, China would also see a boost in exports; although this would require them to acknowledge that economies can go down, as well as up.


Sideways slump for Western markets

  Things are considerably duller on the other side of the world, with both the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100 standing firm in their sideways motions.

Clive Lambert, director of FutureTechs, believes that there are buying opportunities there; but for a buy and hold approach the FTSE isn’t an attractive prospect for now.

  The S&amp;P 500, having been locked in an unprecedented period of being unable to rise or fall by more than 3%, still faces some uncertainty until the Federal Reserve begin raising the rates. Despite most predictions of a 5% fall to ~1970, John Eade, President of Argus research, has a more positive outlook, anticipating a 5% rise to optimistically finish between 6-8% for the year.

This document is a bit out of date - I've permanently suspended my Team Treehouse account until I feel like I have enough breathing room, and I haven't been putting any money in my Ally account for a few months now.

**Steps I've taken so far:** 

* I read a bit here, and I've downloaded the free trial of YNAB and am going to track every expense for 30 days (saw that challenge) to see exactly where my money goes. I've been using Mint for a while, but it's too passive for me. 
* I'm a designer, so I picked up a bit of freelance in my downtime. I don't have a ton of free time, so it's not a lot of work, mostly just $75.00 here and there. 
* I also play in a cover band, and we're going to try to start playing out more. We usually net about $100.00 each a show, and happen to have one this weekend. 
* I'm going to start teaching one of my girlfriends friend's son drums, probably for about $50.00 a month.

**Some extra details:**

* My car will be paid off in April of 2017. 
* As of right now, my mother so kindly still pays for my insurance, but it recently went down when I turned 25 so I could probably pick it up. 
* I am doing the standard repayment through FedLoan for my loans - taking on an extra $20,000 in interest to lower the payments seemed like an awful idea to me, but like I said, I know absolutely nothing about finance. 
* I have a private loan that I used for tuition through Wells Fargo, and this is probably the most frustrating bill I have. I've been paying on it for a long time..over a year I think, and it's like throwing fucking pennies down a well. Here's the breakdown from my latest bill: 

Description | Amount
---|---
Original Principal Balance | $5,052.12
Current Principal Balance | $5,812.62
Current Interest Rate | 6.240
Total Interest Paid | $775.88
Total Principal Paid | $590.61
Total paid on loan | $1,394.49
As you can see, this loan is just brutal, and I have no idea what my options are with it. 


I think that's enough detail...let me know if anything else would help more. I'm sorry this is such a long post. I just feel like I'm drowning, and I have no idea what to do. 

Thanks for any help ahead of time. 

**Ninja Edit:** not sure what flair to tack on to this because I kind of covered everything. If a mod wants to flair it for me, go right on ahead!

personalfinance,"Car loan and insurance, looking for advice on interest rates and credit.","Okay numbers first. 

The remaining car loan 12,000$
Minimum payment 360$
I actually pay 400$ to this bill each month, because I can easily afford it.

Now with the insurance I pay 800$ a month for my car. 

The interest rate on the loan is 3.6-4.0% (I dont have the exact number at the moment.)

So im 19, and am doing well so far but im always looking to do better. This is my first loan and im trying to build myself some credit. 
My question is, is it harmful to my credit if i shop around for lower interest rate loan to pay the loan down quicker?
 Ive had the loan for 1 year and Ive never missed a payment, am I wrong in assuming this may make me eligible for a lower interest rate loan? 
How exactly do you shop for a lower interest rate anyway?

personalfinance,Recent college grad. Starting in public accounting next month. Help me plan my future.,"Hey there /r/personalfinance. First time poster. Love the sub.

I won't take too much time and I'll get straight to the point. I start in public accounting next month. I have an idea of what I want to do with my finances but I would like the sub's input.


Here's a quick rundown on potential income for the first year:

* Annual salary: High $50k
* CPA exam bonus: $5k (I only need one more section. I sit on the 25th of August)
* CPA exam fee reimbursement: $900 when I pass the exam
* I also have the option of a $1500 salary advance interest free.

So basically if I pass the final exam, I would be getting a pretty big paycheck within a couple month of starting.


Current Financial Situation:

* Only have $2k cash
* Only debt is student debt which is about $39k
* Car is paid in full


Student Debt Breakdown:

* About $7.5k in private loans at 8% (ouch)
* Perkins loan of $7k at 5%
* Federal Stafford loans $24k ranging from 3.4 - 4.6%
* $6K of Stafford loans are at 4.6% and the rest are under 4%


Potential Monthly Expenses:

* Rent: $500 with all utilities included (Will be renting a room at my uncle's house)
* Food: $200 (I honestly don't really know, first time being on my own)
* Commuting expenses: $100 - $150
* Car Insurance:$100 (Currently on my parents and have full coverage. I think this is WAY too much and will be changing my plan)
* Cell phone: $30 w/ republic wireless. (I believe the firms pay for a cell phone. If this is true i will switch to the $10/month plan.
* Netflix, Spotify and other subs: $20
* Other expenses including eating out, haircuts, etc: $100 (I will try to minimize this as much as possible)
* Student debt payments: I'm guessing it should be around $400-$500)
* SO is currently abroad while I immigrate them. Usually send over $200/month


This will put my **monthly expenses at around $1400/month** excluding student loan payments (will explain in a bit). Monthly expenses for the year have averaged at about $800 rent free at my parents. So realistically my only additional expenses will only be rent and food. I paid all the bills here at home so that will relieve me of about $100/month (we live in an apartment) so I feel that the $1400 is about right.


Now on to the good part. **My goal is to use up all the savings from working and pay downs my student loans ASAP. I would also like to start contributing to a roth IRA if possible.** I talked to some people at the firms and they said their take home pay after medical deductions, 401k contributions, etc, was about $1300 bi-weekly (This was two years ago). However, I am married so my take home should be a bit higher. But **for planning purposes, let's assume my take home each month will $2600.** This should leave about $1200 a month to pay loans and contribute to a roth IRA. Not sure if the numbers really matter, just trying to give as much info as possible. 


At this point this is where I need everyone's help. 

* Is contributing to an IRA a good idea? Or should I wait until I pay off all the loans that have an interest higher than 4%? 
* I also want to pay the 8% loans ASAP. I was thinking about using the CPA bonus, and the tuition reimbursement to pay this down. Is this reasonable?
* Also, at what point, if any, do you recommend not making extra payments on loans? I would like to eventually start putting all the extra money into a retirement account with Vanguard. I'm one of those people that would like to retire early so I am currently targeting about 40. I don't intend on changing my lifestyle as I am really happy with the way I live.


Additional Info:

* My car, a 2009 Corolla, will need work soon. Apparently they have an issue with the camshaft which causes a grinding noise during a cold start-up. I've researched and people have stated the repair will be about $500-$1000. I do all other maintenance on the car myself.
* I realize I haven't accounted for an emergency fund. I'll only keep about a month in advance in my bank. This is a risk I'm willing to take for the first year.


Feel free to critique my plan and give suggestions if you feel I should do things differently. Look forward to everyone's responses. If I have missed anything, I'll add it to the post. Thanks in advance.",finance,1439305933

personalfinance,Car payments are putting me in a squeeze is it possible to trade the car in for one of much lesser value?,"A little back story about my current situation:

I currently make $4290 a month (before deductions). I am an independent contractor. On top of that 4290 i charge 13% HST. Which amounts to $557.70. I am no accountant so I don't really know what my income tax is going to be. So, to be safe i throw 30% of may pay + the HST into a separate bank account.

With what I have left, I am capable of continuing to own this car, however I would like to increase the level of financial freedom I have.

The car's current trade in value is around $24000. I owe $30000. Its a Camaro 2ss.

With the current interest rate i have (6%, yea i got fucked over) my monthly payments are around $460. My commute to work is about 60km per day. For my normal commute, I take my motorcycle (bike is paid off), its dirt cheap to drive ($10 per week). The car on the other hand, on top of the payments, costs around $15-20 per day depending on how bad traffic is. I normally use it for long distance, passengers, or rainy weather. With winter rolling up soon, im going to have to commute with it daily, and thats going to put a much larger burden on my income.

This decision came after a bit of shock that her bank account was almost -$1,500, and it was a combination of her not keeping track of her finances and the bank fleecing her by structuring the charges to maximize the overdraft fees, which over the course of the last 3 months or so total more than a few hundred dollars. I figured it couldn't hurt to ask the bank to forgive a bit of that, and they did to the tune of $90. I think I can get more but I'm wondering if anyone here could offer some advice to perhaps negotiate the rest, I know it's a long shot but I figured why not try. In the meantime we've cancelled her direct deposit and got us a joint account at the CU I use and have been very happy with, along with downloading the Mint app on all our devices so we can keep track much easier. 

[Here is our monthly budget](https://imgur.com/CQZNoSp), and here is the other debts we owe at the moment:

- $460 on my CU credit card (0% interest for the next 10 months!)
- $585 on my B of A credit card (my goal is to pay this off first)
- $2600 on her discover card ( we're hoping to migrate that over to my credit union where we'll open an account for her and get the same 0% interest for 12 months, I think we can pay it off before the interest rate kicks in)
- $6700 on her car (it's a nice car and she got a good deal)

My goal over the next three years is  that by the time I graduate for us to have zero debt besides my student loans, and don't fret because I'm an Engineering student, so I'm not really worried about paying them off. Right now I have about $22k and will probably graduate with $40k-$50k. At the moment we also have about $3k in savings.",finance,1439315266

CryptoCurrency,Nu 2.0 is released!,"Here are the download links:

* [Windows Nu 2.0 Download](https://nubits.com/sites/default/files/assets/nu-2.0.0-win-gitian.zip)

* [Linux Nu 2.0 Download](https://nubits.com/sites/default/files/assets/nu-2.0.0-linux-gitian.zip)

* [OS X Nu 2.0 Download](https://nubits.com/sites/default/files/assets/nu-2.0.0-osx.zip)

The Nu 2.0 release has passed testing and the team agrees it is now ready for general deployment on the production network. The new protocol will become effective August 25th at 14:00 UTC. If you don't upgrade by then, your client will reject 2.0 blocks and be isolated on a non-consensus fork. So upgrading is truly mandatory.

2.0 is packed with powerful new features and changes:

**NuShare custodial grants** - The custodian system now permits NuShare custodians. This process is exactly the same as with NuBits, except NuShares are granted to an NSR address.

**Protocol voting** - Clients now vote for their protocol version. Each version of the reference client has a protocol version number hard coded in it. This number is placed on the blockchain in the coinstake transaction when a block is minted, similar to how other votes are cast. This vote is not user configurable, so it has no user interface components. When 90% of the last 2000 blocks have voted to increment the protocol version AND any applicable date criteria for the protocol change is met, the protocol will change. If the percentage of the last 2000 blocks voting for a protocol version falls back below 90% threshold, no action will be taken. The protocol version in effect cannot be decremented.

**Change maximum interest rate increase/decrease** – This enhancement changes the maximum interest rate rise from 1% per 1440 blocks to a per block rise of 0.002% and enforces a maximum per block interest rate decrease of 0.004%. This allows an increase of approximately 3% per day and a decrease of 6% per day.

**Propagate the liquidity identifier through the network** – This enhancement changes the 'getliquidityinfo' RPC to now contain a liquidity tier breakdown and also a custodian breakdown. In addition, a new RPC ('getliquiditydetails') will return liquidity info of all the identifiers of each custodian.

**Make park rates effective 60 blocks after the actual vote** – As originally designed, parking rates are determined based on the rates published for the block that contains a parking transaction. This change uses the rate from 60 blocks in the past. This will permit the parking rates to be known 60 blocks into the future.

**Dynamic fee** – This enhancement permits shareholders to vote to set transaction fees. The median vote is the fee. Transaction fees are also set using the fee from 60 blocks in the past. The client uses the highest fee to be charged in the next 10 blocks. Default transaction fees equal to the current transaction fees are applied if there is no transaction fee vote for a particular currency in the majority of share days for the voting period of 2000 blocks.

Something happened with his financial aid and will not know how much he is going to receive until the end of September. I have been bad with money for a good part of my life, but have been on the right track going forward. Here is my monthly:

EMERGENCY: 100 (OUR CARS ARE OLD)

My BF has about 5000 saved, I have 3000. I don't have a car payment, my phone bill is not negotiable since I pay for my mom, dad, sister, myself (there's 5 lines on our plan, we get a discount and my other 2 siblings pay their share) The cable company has lowered it as much as they can, if I cancel now, it's $300, I can end my contract in March. My BF's credential program is fast track, ends next May, MON-FRIDAY 7-4 and some Saturdays. I put my numbers in a spreadsheet and it looks like, if I just count on my income, all of it would go to bills for the both of us, if we don't touch what we have saved.

personalfinance,College student looking for some advice.,"Alright everyone, I'm a 19 y/o college student and I have problems saving money. I'm looking to put back as much money as possible so I can possibly get an apartment of my own sometime in the near future. Let me lay out a little info for you guys. 

The college I go to is pretty well paid for through scholarships and financial aid, that includes books. I live close to the college so I just commute every day. Then at the end of every semester I get a check back for (give or take) about $1k. I don't know if a lot of colleges do this, I just consider myself lucky that I get what I get. 

I work a part time job and make a little over $8 an hour. My hours fluctuate quite a bit at time since we are over staffed at my workplace. But on average I'd say that I make around $230 every two weeks. We'll just round it up to $450 every month. It can be up to $100 more a month but not any less than -$50 a month. 

My vehicle is my main problem, it gets TERRIBLE gas mileage (10-14 mpg). And that's with me driving economically as possible. I could easily spend $60-90 in gas a week if I'm not cautious or I have a lot of back and forth driving to do. 
 
Besides that I try not to spend so much of my money but it always seems that I spend it without knowing how much I'm throwing away. I just recently opened a savings account and have around $150 in it. I would like to add as much as possible to it and let it grow, that way I can possibly afford to move out of my parents home soon. I have another year and a half or so before I can get a better job with my first degree. But then I'll still continue my college education because that's only my first step. 

I want to build these skills so I don't throw all my money away in the future. The job I hope to acquire once I finish school would be a 6 figure salary and then some annually. But I'm afraid if I don't learn how to put money back, it'll come back to haunt me in the future. 

Any advice would be appreciated and I'll answer any questions to clear up confusion if needed. Thanks.",finance,1439320402

With principle, taxes, interest, insurance and mortgage insurance, his monthly payments are about $1750 and he's been paying $1800 even for about 5 years.  I believe his pay-off is about $235,000.  I think he should be able to get a better interest rate and maybe get rid of the mortgage insurance, but I also suggested he get a 25 year mortgage rather than a 30 year (actually a 20 year would be better, I think).  His wife said that since they are most likely not going to live there after they retire, then there is no reason to do that.  She says they should refinance at 30 years to get a lower payment and a better tax advantage while they are in the house.  He is 57 and hopes to retire at 65 or 66.  He makes about $125,000 and she makes about $12,000.  His credit rating is about 680 but is going up (had a business reversal a couple of years ago that forced him to max out several credit cards, but no late pays).

I just am not sure of the best route to take. All I know is the interest is killing me. I guess I should start off by telling you what my debt is -

I have a credit card which is my main killer. I currently have around $3,500 on this card. The interest is at around 25%. Every month, while I make payments 0f $200… it charges me at least $60 for interest. 
I have a credit account with Ideal Image. There is only about $1,500 left on this and the interest is at around 26%, however because the amount is lower it charges me around $3 per month for interest.
I have a car loan and to be honest I am not sure how much my interest rate is on that, however I know I have around $9,000 left on it to pay and I pay $293 a month.

I feel like this is a lot of debt for someone who is 23. I am managing fine I guess, but the credit card specifically is just not going away.
I should probably also mention that I have just started college again and I was granted a subsidized student loan for $3,500. I know I will have to take out another next year as well. I don’t have to worry about paying this back until I graduate in a few years, but I would like to be able to pay it back easily in the future and not have it just piled on top of what I already have.
I guess my main question is to ask if I should take out a small personal loan of some type, that has a lower interest rate and pay off my credit card and Ideal Image. 
I hope I provided enough information.

personalfinance,Help Me Prioritize and Allocate Funds for Several Short and Long Term Goals,"Intro:

So here's the deal. I'm 30 years old with a good job making 81.5k per year in a relatively cheap market. My girlfriend (soon to be fiancee) is 25, trying to launch her career in a meh job making 40k. I am trying to nail down our financial situation before we go about getting married and starting a family.

Savings:

I have a 10k emergency fund, 27k in my 401(k) where my employer matches 50% up to 6%, 3k in an HSA, and just opened a Roth IRA with a 1k deposit. I chose the Roth partially because I can take back contributions in an emergency, but mainly for flexibility later in life as it gives me pre and post tax retirement accounts, but if there are more compelling reasons to contribute to a standard IRA instead, I'm open to that. My girlfriend has no savings but has begun contributing to her 401(k) which has some minimal employer match. 

Debt:

We have about 92k in student loan debt, mostly at 6.8%. She owes 12.7k on a car at a very high interest rate. I know paying the car off ASAP should be priority #1 for us. 

Expenses:

My gf has some food allergies and we both really love food so our food budget is higher than most. We are about to move, so our rent figure is up in the air. I think we need to keep this low as possible, within reason, given our goals. The only other things we spend quite a bit higher than average on is gym and hair/haircuts, both at $60 per month. 

Goals:

--Increase emergency fund. While 10k is doable, it's not great for 2 people. And I think it won't suffice when we bring a third into the picture in a few years. Would you agree with this?

--Have the ability to retire relatively early, late 50s or so, if we so desire without having to live a simpler lifestyle.

--Pay down debts of course. Again, the car debt needs to die in a heap of fire and brimstone. But I am unsure if I should go as far as stopping retirement contributions to achieve this. And I struggle to find the right amount to contribute to student loans given our aggressive retirement goals. We pay the minimum payments, but that isn't sustainable. 

--I believe I will need to replace my car in the next couple of years and would prefer to save enough to buy a used car in cash. 

--We may want to buy a home in the next few years. I have no idea if this is optimal given our other goals. We are both perfectly fine with living in a cheaper home given the timing is right and job factors don't push us to more expensive markets. I doubt we'd ever own a home any time soon if that occurred.

--We obviously have a wedding coming up. We have both lived all over the place and have large families. There's no way it will be small. But we will be fortunate enough to receive significant help from parents which I estimate will be in the low 5 figure range. I think we could keep this close to $0 considering that and my gf's DIY skills and desires.

--We will eventually want to save to pay for a portion of future college expenses for any child we have. I know this should be allocated $0 at the moment, but perhaps I'm not considering how this goal could interact with others, so I wanted to note it.

Conclusion:

So how do I prioritize? What do I allocate where? I have taken a strong interest in personal finance lately and my girlfriend is all too willing to let me take the reins on these issues, so I'm ready to do what it takes. Thanks for any advice you can offer.",finance,1439331661

The strategy is currently incorporating it lowest amount of leverage since October 2013 after tracking close to its 33% maximum for over a year.  The model is still moderately positive and indicates that US equities is still an attractive class.

In addition, the Allocation’s investments in US Treasury Bonds stand at its highest level since January 2013.  Since the strategy’s benchmark is the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500, the model is indicating the Treasury Bonds could outperform equities, especially if stocks turn lower. The Allocation's overweight to technology has also risen while retaining its overweight to Finance and Health Care and underweight to Basic Materials, Energy, Real Estate (recently reduced from overweight) and Gold Mining.

It should be noted that the quantitative algorithm behind the Post-MPT Growth Allocation is totally objective and strives to predict expected returns for nine low correlated asset classes.  The expected returns are determined by assessing the changes in over a dozen economic and capital market factors.  Then the algorithm creates an optimized portfolio with the goal of producing the highest possible returns that have the lowest chance of market value declines.  So the proper way to interpret the algorithm’s current output is:

The algorithm is moderately bullish and that we could see new highs this year;

The risk for a correction has increased significantly. As of 7/7/15, the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 is only 4% off its all-time high. It could drop further if second quarter earnings announcement disappoint and foreign troubles negatively impact economic demand;

If stocks go into a correction, US Treasury bonds, at recent highs in yield, will be purchased by investors. The Federal Reserve will postpone their first increase until December at the earliest. We believe that at year-end 2016, the Federal Funds rate will stand no higher than 0.50%. If this is the case, interest rates will decline and bond prices will rise;

The Allocation is overweighting sectors with earnings visibility. It is underweighting sectors that are sensitive to economic strength or inflationary pressures.

personalfinance,Advice on whether to purchase a home.,"I am in my mid-twenties.  Live with my parents.  I have approximately $55,000 in student loans, both federal and private (about $27,000 each).  I have credit cards that are paid in full every month.  I have a 775 credit score.  I have an emergency fund and a checking totaling around $5,000.  I make approximately $34,000 before taxes.  

My parents have recently asked me to consider purchasing a house that will be on the market soon in my neighborhood as an investment home.  They own two other homes; one that is in the same city as we live, which is rented out, another in another state, which is currently uninhabited and has been for about 6 months.  They want me to get a credit check to see if I qualify and how much I would qualify for a home loan.  Most homes around here have recently gone from $65,000 - $100,000.  

Considering my credit score, I do believe I would qualify for the loan, although I'd like someone's input on that as I may be incorrect.  My short term (5 year or less) goals are to pay off the private loan and apply for graduate school.  The federal loan would go into deferment.  I am concerned that the hard credit check is going to lower my score and get me a higher interest loan for graduate school.  If I do go ahead and accept the loan, I am also concerned that I may not be able to make payments on the investment home if I am unable to find someone to rent it, as I may be away for graduate school or I'll never go to graduate school because of this new debt.  

But I do see a positive.  This investment home could become my income while I am in school.  I could use it to pay off some of my mortgage and student loans as well.  

I do not intend on moving back to my hometown after graduate school.  So I would have to either sell the house, or keep it as a rental home.  I somewhat am considering getting the credit check just to show them that I considered it but I am wary of the hard credit check just for the hell of it.  Any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1439338938

personalfinance,Company with two private loans won't consolidate,"Please bare with me as this will be extensive: I've been going to a private college for the past 2 years. When I first enrolled I was told by the admissions rep (who was no longer working there months after) that it would be in my best interest to sign up for the diploma program first and then the Associates Degree as the classes rolled into each other and if my grades were good I would get my books for free. I was also promised that two loans would be consolidated when I re-enrolled. My intention was always to do the Associates but the idea of saving some money appealed to me.

So I sign up and was applied for federal assistance first. After only getting some I was applied for private loans with the company that handles my school's loans. 

Everything was fine with the school up until last year when it went apparently bankrupt and bought out by a company out of California. All hell broke loose with regulation changes. Including with loans. The school was bought out 1 month before I finished my diploma program. I had no choice but to finish since I didn't want to have some half assed diploma. When I went to re-enroll I was told that I had to take out new loans since I was going for a new program. When I addressed them about consolidation they informed me that due to the fact that these loans were with the prior school that they would not take them over. I tried to make the argument that how is that possible if I would be paying the same company but they would not budge. Even after escalating the issue I was met with the same answer. 

As a result I am now stuck with 2 private loans that  I've been paying every month at separate times to the SAME company. Both have different interest rates. PLUS I have federal loans that will kick in a couple of months after I graduate next month. 

What options do I have as far as the private loans?? Should I have to pay off a loan to a company that doesn't exist anymore??

EDIT: After speaking to one of my teachers he mentioned to me that it appears that the company handling my loans may or may not report to the credit bureau. I took it with a grain of salt but I have noticed that after a year of on time payments my credit has not been affected at all. Is that even possible?",finance,1439341613
personalfinance,Boyfriend has a tuition gap after federal loans and scholarships. Need advice on private student loans ASAP.,"Just to preface: I am not combined with my boyfriend's finances. His loans are his loans, and no I will never cosign.

Long story short, (no pun intended) my boyfriend is approximately 7k short in his tuition from last year. He needs to pay it off before he can register for the fall, which starts in a month. This will be his final year of school and he is really to finally be done with his bachelors, especially since this will be his fifth year. (the school we go to is infamous for keeping students a fifth year) He is still a dependent, so his aid is limited to scholarships and federal loans.

We both have a lot of questions about private student loans, since neither of us have ever gone down this path before. (I had a full ride scholarship to the same school.)

1. What should he be looking for in a student loan, besides low interest rates? 

2. Is there a good website or resource that can lay out all this information, or list some good private lenders? Since time is not on his side, he really can't devote a ton of time rigorously researching every private student loan lender.

3. Do any private loans offer grace periods? Ideally he wants to pay this after he graduates. From the basic searches I did so far, I had trouble finding out about their grace periods.

4. What's the difference between fixed and variable rates?

Having spoken to multiple people who have personally interacted with the presiding Judge Henry J. Boroff during these proceedings, believe that the Honorable Judge is interested in preserving shareholders value so long as there is righteous, legal, and clear cause to do so.

There is a pending hearing on the 27th of August 2015 for what will likely be the final opportunity for Shareholders (termed in federal bankruptcy cases as ""Equity Security Holders"") to achieve representation during this case!

From my experience face-to-face with the parties to this case (GTAT -- termed, ""the Debtors"", The Bondholders (termed, ""the creditors""), and the presiding judge, it is certain that letters to the court in support of the Equity Security Holder's petition for the appointment of a Committee of Equity Security Holders will create a bigger opportunity for such a committee to be formed!

You as a shareholder of GT Advanced Technologies, et al. will then have paid legal representation during these hearings.

We all know that Tom Guttierrez shockingly and suddenly retired yesterday because he doesn't want to be called to the stand to testify if an Equity Holders committee is created.

But that does not protect us equity security holders from getting slaughtered if we fail to support the legal professionals, investment analysis profesionals, and volunteer team of equity holders who are working to get us paid representation.

ethereum,Another useless but hopefully fun and informative contract: A simulation of a government's debt,"**EDIT: The Ponzi collapsed, don't use it! Your money would be lost!**


I had this idea for quite a while in my mind. I was looking for ways to build it trustless with Bitcoin but it is just SO MUCH easier with ethereum!

So - I call it the government simulation. The government needs money and takes loans. It will pay an interest rate of 10%. However, the government is not very efficient. Only 5% will make it to the economy and 90% will be used to pay old creditors. As long as always new money comes in, all dept will eventually be paid (with 10% interest rate) but if money stops to flow into the system it will crash. However - the last creditor (who saw the crash coming) will make a huge win (because he shortened the stock markets) In the the beginning it will be 500 ETH but it will grow up to 10,000ETH.



**tl dr**: Send ether to ""0xc2ac6849aec3938fb8c9b36f1c07be76f766637e"" (at least 1% of the contract balance). If a lot of people will do it after you, you get your amount +10% back. If 12h (3456 blocks) pass without another investment you earn the full contract balance (at least 500 ETH)


Command to send 10 ether:
&gt;eth.sendTransaction({from: eth.accounts[0], to:""0xc2ac6849aec3938fb8c9b36f1c07be76f766637e"", value: web3.toWei(10, ""Ether""), gas: 150000})

(make sure to allow 150,000 gas)

This is my first DAPP. It was really fun building it. However - really no guarantee at all that it works as described - please read the code and let us learn together. I funded it with 500ETH - if you find out a way how to get them: please do so - but please let us know how it was done!


**P.S.** if you haven't realized it: of course this is mainly a Ponzi scheme - decide for yourself how to deal with it.



**Some Tipps and tricks**:
here is the contract:
http://pastebin.com/A9sE9WNb
if you want to verify: copy it and past it here: https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/ (don't check the optimize checkbox)
You can see that it creates the same byte code that is stored on this address:
&gt;https://etherchain.org/account/0xc2ac6849aec3938fb8c9b36f1c07be76f766637e (click on code an compare)

Now you can be sure that this is the contract from the ""pastbin"".

To interact with the contract you can just sender ether to the address: 0xc2ac6849aec3938fb8c9b36f1c07be76f766637e
Make sure to send at least 1% of the contact balance (in the beginning 6ETH) - otherwise the contract will just send the money back.

If you want to do adcanced interaction and explore all the data use this:
When your geth is running - open a consolse in a new terminal with: ""geth attach""


Now you can define the signature of the functions of this contract with this command:

&gt;var governmentContract = web3.eth.contract([{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""corrupt_Elite"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""address""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""profit_From_Crash"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint256""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[{""name"":""buddy"",""type"":""uint32""}],""name"":""Lend_Government_Money"",""outputs"":[],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""last_Creditor_PayedOut"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint32""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[],""name"":""investInTheSystem"",""outputs"":[],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint256""}],""name"":""creditor_Addresses"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""address""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""last_Time_of_New_Credit"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint64""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint256""}],""name"":""creditor_Amounts"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint256""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[],""name"":""sumDebt"",""outputs"":[{""name"":""debt"",""type"":""uint256""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""last_Creditor"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint32""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[{""name"":""next_Generation"",""type"":""address""}],""name"":""InheritToNextGeneration"",""outputs"":[],""type"":""function""},{""inputs"":[],""type"":""constructor""}]);

In the next step you bind it to the correct address:

&gt;var g = governmentContract.at(""0xc2ac6849aec3938fb8c9b36f1c07be76f766637e"")

now just typ g to get an overview of the commands

now you can explor the contract:
lets first look at the total debt of the ""government""
&gt;g.sumDebt.call()

ok, next lets look at the balance of the ""government""

&gt;eth.getBalance(g.address)

so this is the money you would get if you ""invest"" and for 12 hours no one invests.
now lets have a look how many creditors already send money to the ""government"":

&gt;g.last_Creditor.call()

Alright - lets send some money:

&gt;eth.sendTransaction({from: eth.accounts[0], to: g.address, value: web3.toWei(20, ""Ether""), gas: 500000})

Maybe you need to unlock your account first: you can do it with this command:

&gt;personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0], ""YourPassword"", 1000)

The 1000 is the time the unlock is valid (currently broken, it will be unlocked until you close geth)
Now lets make sure that our interest was registered correctly.
Check that the tx is already sent:

&gt;txpool

if pending is 0 is was sent for sure.

Now you can check that your interest is registered correctly:
check again:

&gt;g.last_Creditor.call()
The number should have increased.

&gt;g.creditor_Amounts.call(THE_NUMBER_FROM_THE_LAST_STEP - 1)
&gt;g.creditor_Addresses.call(THE_NUMBER_FROM_THE_LAST_STEP - 1)

This should return your amount +10% and your address.
Check this:

&gt;g.last_Creditor_PayedOut.call()
As soon as this number reaches your number you will get your payout.
Or:

&gt;g.last_Time_of_New_Credit.call()

This is the block you invested to the contact (as long as no one ""invested"" right after you). If from this block on for 3456 blocks (12h) no one will invest at least 1% of the contact balance you will will the full balance.

investing,Tactics for First-Time Buyers,"It was less than a year ago that Mrs Scot and I first jumped on the property ladder. While many finance bloggers preach that renting a house is far superior to buying  – After 11 months of home-ownership I can honestly say that it was the best decision ever! While technically speaking, we don’t fully own the house (the bank does for the next couple of decades) – it is an amazing feeling being able to paint, drill holes and carry-out renovations without seeking permission. Better still, there is no landlord or agency that can turn up for an inspection with 24 hours notice!
If you’re looking at buying a home and want to get your foot on the first rung of the property ladder, you’ve probably already begun viewing properties, investigating mortgage interest rates and maybe even thought about making an offer. At this point, it is important to ensure that you have considered three key things before even looking to buy: Long-Term Plan, Affordability and Exit Plan. Assuming that you have, here are three tips to help you with the next step of the process:
 
Finding a Property
Simply browsing estate agents’ windows may not find you that dream home; you have to put the effort in. This may involve widening your search and investigating your options online. Consider property comparison sites - and use many of them. Just because the ‘big’ ones don’t list a house, it doesn’t mean that it is not worth considering. While it is advantageous to have your house listed in the main directories when selling, not everyone knows about them – and not all estate agents use the comparison sites. Search the online databases of local estate agents and don’t forget about local newspapers. Consider auctions and foreclosures – more often than not, the hidden gems are the ones that you have to do a bit of looking to find!
Don’t just limit yourself to one specific area either. You may have your ideal location, but it may be worthwhile also considering alternative options at this stage. Work out a ‘zone’ where you would be prepared to commute to work from – investigate public transport links, local schools, shops, services etc. Don’t make the mistake that we did and buy a house that is one street away from a fiber-optic broadband connection!
 Tactics for First-Time Buyers
Putting in an Offer
Once you’ve found a property that’s suitable for your needs, the next step is to put in an offer. Obviously you’ll be aware of the asking price, but always try and leave some room for negotiation when putting forward an initial offer – this will leave you with the possibility of reaching some middle ground with the vendor. Most people don’t know what is the ‘expected’ discount on an offer – the truth of the matter is that there is no standard and you can negotiate until your heart’s content! We put in an offer £10,000 under the asking price (which had already been dropped £7,500). We reached middle ground and saved an additional £4000; with a bunch of appliances and furniture included – (fridge, dishwasher, bookcases, sideboard cupboards).
This is the stage when you can start to think a little tactically. Always be mindful of the circumstances of the seller as this can often create some room for manoeuvre on the price. Often sellers may need to make a quick sale and as a first-time buyer this places you in an extremely advantageous position. As you’re not involved in a chain the sale can go through quickly. Remember this and use it to your advantage when making an offer. A lower price on a quick sale may well be more attractive to the vendor.
It’s also worth bearing in mind that if you are buying property in Scotland, there is a slightly different process to follow when putting in an offer.
Another point to bear in mind is that you will often have to prove your ability to qualify for a mortgage. Pre-approvals can be obtained with a given validity and are an excellent thing to have in advance of making an offer. It will also make you a more favorable party if there are multiple offers on the table.
 
See it through
This may not be a specific tactic, but it’s still worthwhile advice. Once your offer is accepted, it really pays to be conscientious and see everything through. It’s imperative that you complete everything on time because even though your offer has been accepted you can still be ‘gazumped’. You can’t necessarily stop this happening, but by ensuring you keep up to date with your side of things, you can place yourself in the best position to avoid this. Furthermore, at this stage you have likely already occurred legal fees – being sloppy and not acting quickly can cost you a bit of cash!

I have no credit card debt or other debt of any kind.  My mom is helping me payoff my student loans.  However, she also has ~$15,000 in credit card debt of her own at an interest rate of 13%.

I had the idea to give her money toward her credit card debt before paying off my student loans, in exchange for her taking responsibility for an equal amount of my student loans (ex: I pay $15,000 to her credit card, then I'm off the hook for $15,000 of my loans).  My reasoning is that I pay roughly the same amount of money either way, but she saves some money in interest.

I have a great relationship with my mom, and I have no worries of her sticking me with my loans after I help her like some people might.  But does this plan have any other consequences I'm not aware of such as worsening my credit, etc.?

Bitcoin,The ACTUAL Blockstream business plan,"Bitcoin (the system) cannot do *everything* that people want to do with BTC; so, the solution is to make your own system that is usable with BTC through a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg.

That is, the solution is not to create your own token, but rather to use Bitcoin's token; this doesn't detach BTC from Bitcoin's blockchain, but rather this attaches your blockchain to BTC.

* I think this is how it will play out: Blockstream will create a number of blockchain systems that are specifically useful to banks, but these systems won't supply their own unique tokens; instead, you'll have to send your BTC tokens to these systems through what's called a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg, and in this way, you'll be able to do interesting and even proprietary things with your BTC that you cannot do with just plain Bitcoin—and more importantly, you can transfer those tokens *back* to Bitcoin when you're finished, thereby escaping the dangers of some other network; this is what people mean by ""The Internet of Money"".

    For instance, Blockstream's [Alpha](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements) sidechain offers ""confidential&amp;nbsp;transactions"", which don't allow onlookers to see exactly how much value has been transferred, which is very appealing to banks.

    The problem is that right now Bitcoin doesn't support 2-way&amp;nbsp;pegs, so Blockstream has developed a method that anybody can use to get things started: The Federated Peg, which is a centralized (but still distributed) federation of computers that handle the business of enforcing a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg; such a federation would be perfect for a consortium of competing banks, for instance.

    In the future, it might be somehow worthwhile to ""outsource"" the business of securing the sidechain to anybody else in the world, and so such a system could transition from a federation to merged mining if the hashrate is high enough, but then fall back on a federation if the hashrate falls too low.

    The 2-way peg could be outsourced in this way by having Bitcoin handle it, but that would require Bitcoin to be altered with a soft fork; of course, if Bitcoin ever includes a sufficiently expressive script system to allow for truly programmable money, then a decentralized 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg could be implemented as a smart contract with no special treatment.

* Now, why in particular would all of this be useful to banks? Well, people like standards; they want one tool and one system—one that is well defined with characteristics about which one can reason.

    Blockchain data structures excel at allowing immense and widespread auditing with few resources, and frankly, that's what banking and notaries and the like are all about.

    For instance, git (which also uses Merkle trees to create an increasingly secure record of events, just like Bitcoin) allows disparate people—even&amp;nbsp;enemies—to come to *consensus* about the correct history of very complex projects; the same could be done with a ledger, and that is why it's useful to the financial world.

    In a way, the rest of the world is starting to wake up to modern practices of source code management, *and* the benefit of removing authority over that management from of any one party's hands.

-----------

With regard to the Lightning Network, such an overlay (or something like it) is the *only* way that Bitcoin can scale, and Bitcoin must be scaled in order to be self-sustaining; the volume of transactions must grow tremendously in order for Bitcoin usage to be both cheap and secure.

* One data center for processing **Visa** transactions was handling at&amp;nbsp;least [2500&amp;nbsp;transactions per second](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-03-25/visa-data-center/53774904/1) in the year *2012*.

    At an average of [600&amp;nbsp;bytes per transaction](https://tradeblock.com/blog/bitcoin-network-capacity-analysis-part-2-macro-transaction-trends), that would require a **900&amp;nbsp;MB&amp;nbsp;block** in Bitcoin.

    That being said, the problem with increasing the block size is 2 fold:

    * **Centralization**

        The premise of Bitcoin is that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though it doesn't guarantee it.

        Increasing the block size damages that design for decentralization; of course, *some* centralization might be a good tradeoff if it yields a much more usable system, but it's clear that growing the block size is a pretty damn limited solution in that regard.

        Further exacerbating the issue is the fact that the mining industry is going to be rapidly losing its income over the next several years. Right now, some miners are complaining that even 1&amp;nbsp;MB blocks are too large, even while [the whole mining industry is currently getting paid the equivalent of *completely&amp;nbsp;full* 80&amp;nbsp;MB blocks at 4&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;cents per transaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3fhfka/currently_the_mining_industry_is_getting_paid_as/).

        Suppose that the mining industry copes with the loss of income by losing participants and shutting down mining hardware. Well, again, Bitcoin is designed on the premise that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority.

        * Losing miners possibly reduces the participants with general interests.

        * Losing hashrate lowers the barrier to authority.

        As an aside, an interesting question is how high must a hashrate be in order to be sufficient, and how is that information communicated (whether directly or indirectly) between participants?

    * **Hard&amp;nbsp;Forking**

        Unfortunately, to update the allowable block size, a new altcoin must be created based on a copy of Bitcoin's blockchain, and then everybody must switch to that altcoin.

        The common sense is that the block size limit needs to be increased to avoid people jumping ship to some better altcoin; well, that altcoin would, at&amp;nbsp;worst, have to copy Bitcoin's blockchain to have any chance. That is, at wost, people would start jumping over to a hard&amp;nbsp;fork, the most popular of such altcoins being ""Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT"".

        So, some people are saying we've got to hard&amp;nbsp;fork now, before we are forced to hard&amp;nbsp;fork later; it doesn't make any sense. It might be better to take our chances on the existing, working system, and only be forced to the new system by the actual market forces, rather than ideology.

* So, at some point, there needs to be a **transaction-consolidation network** sitting atop Bitcoin, using Bitcoin as a highly secure settlement system; it must be recognized that Bitcoin *is* a settlement system rather than a currency system, and only after accepting that fact can you start designing a system that works for both settlement *and* currency.

    After all, it's more important to secure 100&amp;nbsp;thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee.

    Go ahead; stick your coffee purchase in the settlement layer directly if you want, but you won't want to do so, because that's insane; there is no point in storing that one transaction for all time in a highly secure record.

    This development is virtually *proved* by the fact that there are *already* so many ad&amp;nbsp;hoc off-chain transaction consolidation networks (ChangeTip, Coinbase, Circle, exchanges, etc.); using the settlement layer directly just does not make sense.

    *Fortunately*, **such an overlay need not be centralized**; consider something like the [Lightning&amp;nbsp;Network](https://lightning.network/).",cryptocurrency,1439377054

Bitcoin,"I understand Bitcoin conceptually, but unsure how to actually get started.","There is a service I would like to pay for on the internet in bitcoin. So I've spent the last day or so reading about Bitcoin. Reading the FAQ here, watching the recommended videos, reading the ELI5 posts. But actually getting started is where I'm stuck.

I'm confused about buying / selling bitcoin vs a wallet. I assume a wallet is where you physically store your bitcoin. But is that linked to where you buy / sell them? Like, I see Coinbase recommended a lot. And it seems I can exchange USD for bitcoin on there. And then they'll store them for you, correct? Taking care of backups and security and whatnot? 

If I wanted to buy and store them in separate places, how do I go about doing that? 

And then there's the fees. Watching the FAQ videos, a point that was made over and over was that there is no centralized bank that will ""steal"" from you in the form of fees. And yet, there seem to be fees at every turn. Buying and selling seem to have fees. And every transaction pays out a fee to the miners. Am I misunderstanding the ""no fee"" aspect? Or is there a way to bypass the fees by taking a more DIY approach? If I were going to meet up with someone and physically purchase bitcoin from them, how would I guarantee that what they're handing me is a legit, unused bitcoin, rather than a bunch of meaningless numbers and letters?

**Edit:** I'm also going through the signup process with Circle, and they are asking for my SSN for ""US federal and state banking regulations"". I thought the point of bitcoin was to get around all of this?

Some disjointed questions in there, but I would appreciate any help!

personalfinance,Investment Pro Tip: Stay the Course (Repost - seems like it's one of those times again),"Based on the number of posts in the last few days about declining portfolios, it seems that a lot of our new members in /r/personalfinance are finally getting a taste of real stock market volatility.  

As I write this, the S&amp;P 500 is down about 20 points (-0.96%).  The past few months has seen the S&amp;P off about 5% from its high in May.  Things like this simply happen every once in a while.  Getting caught up in the hysteria is what separates good investors from bad.

A list of things you *should* do on days like these include:

* **Review your asset allocation.**  If a 5% drop in the value of your portfolio has you shaking, imagine what a 2008-like bear market (-40 to -60%, give or take) will do for your nerves.  

* **Ignore the noise.** You can bet that roiling financial markets will absolutely explode on TV and certain corners of the interweb.  Ignore the doom and gloom to the extent you can.  You should give approximately zero shits about China's Yuan devaluation, Grexits, Alphabet/Google, Federal Reserve rate increases, or any other headlines that may or may not have major financial implications.

* **Rebalance from bonds to stocks** if you haven't in a while.  The past couple months' performance means that you may be off your target asset allocation by a significant amount, depending on your method of rebalancing and triggers for doing so.

* **Keep things in perspective.** If you're investing correctly, either your time horizon is long or your asset allocation is one you're comfortable with.  If you're young, even large market swings probably aren't going to matter that much when it comes time to retire (and this doesn't even count as a large market swing, yet).  If you're older, your investments should be more conservative in the first place and hopefully you aren't as worried.

* **Turn your worrying into something positive.** Instead of worrying about your investments, turn your fear into motivation for something positive, like improving your job performance (decreasing the likelihood of being laid off if things get *really* bad), reviewing your finances, or stocking your emergency fund.  [Focus on what you can control](http://redd.it/2a2zn1).

**Remember**, it is human to be averse to losing money, even if your losses are on paper.  Smart investors *keep* those losses on paper.  

""Staying the course"" is probably the most difficult aspect of successful investing.  Use the market's recent performance as a barometer for how you'll perform in a true crisis, and make the necessary adjustments before it's too late.",finance,1439386951

**Here's the living situation I'm in (US):**
I'm living with my mother because I thought living in an apartment and paying monthly rent and not gaining anything from it was stupid. Did it for two years. Wasn't worth it. Anyways, when I moved in with her we struck a deal. She said as long as I put the $400 that would be going towards rent into a savings account I could live with her and just help out with a few other things around the house which has ended up being $200 a month to her and paying for the internet which is $70.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Yes, I know this isn't necessarily the best way I could be doing things but it's the situation I've gotten myself into and no, talking to her really isn't an option. The best thing I could potentially talk to her about is put the money I do have saved away from this arrangement - $6,800 - in a short term investment possibly to at least gain a little more from it. 
&amp;nbsp;  
Now for specifically what is going on in my head that I could use advice on...  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**On The Table**  
I was just awarded two offers for student aid through school as follows:  
* Ford Federal Unsubsidized Loan for a total of $20,000 ($10k distributed for Fall semester and $10k to be distributed for Spring semester) (5.84% Fixed &amp; Deferred while in school)  
* &amp; Ford Federal Grad PLUS Loan of $12,392 (Same thing, half now, half later) (6.84% Fixed &amp; 4.292&amp; Origination Fee of $265.00 &amp; Deferred while in school)    
&amp;nbsp;  
School is going to cost about the following for the next four semester. It may go up a bit I'm sure as prices rise.  
* Fall 2015 Semester $8,629.04 (confirmed)  
* Spring 2016 Semester $8,629.04 (estimated)  
* Summer 2016 Semester $5,000 (estimated from Summer 2015)  
* Spring 2016 Semester $8,629.04 (estimated)  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
My initial thought is this: Accept both awarded loans and use them to pay for the Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 semesters while using the leftover to pay off the Credit Card and Personal Loan which have the highest interest rates and then put whatever is still leftover from that towards the Stafford loans and essentially consolidate my debt into these lower interest rate amounts. From there I would have to re-evaluate my budget and spending and start chucking money like crazy at whatever is left of the Stafford loans and then start paying off other student loans in the avalanche style most likely.  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
Is this crazy? Is this legal? Should I do this? Is there a better way to attack this?  
&amp;nbsp;

personalfinance,[Student Loans] I have no idea what I'm doing with my repayment. I think I have 2 separate providers?,"I searched through the other posts, but nothing seems to be like my problem.  I graduated in 2010 and have barely made any payments. Fed Loan Servicing is one of my loans... and Great Lakes is the other one.  Both are in forbearance right now... but interest is accruing.       

What I don't understand is where the Great Lakes one came from... I don't remember signing up for that.... maybe that is one that got forwarded to them from my other Fed Loan loan because I wasn't making payments?  Does that happen?  But if that is the case, then my FedLoan one is still listed on my account.  So its confusing!        

Right now, my great lakes one is about $6,000 and there are2 Fed Loan ones... first is $2,5000 and the other is $5,500.

Either way, I am fed up and pissed off and hoping that you lovely people of PF can help a tax newbie out before the extension deadline on October 15th. I refuse to be a victim in this situation, but I simply do not know where to turn that will allow me to only file for my state without the federal return getting involved, and I need some human advice that isn't coming from a worker drone.

For financial context, I am just about the easiest demographic to work with. No kids, no house, no stock, no military service, etc etc. I am a college student grossing in less than $5.5k a year and that is just about it.

I'd also like to stress that I received my federal return just fine way back in March, so I was not scammed in that area.

Thank you very much for your time, PF.",finance,1439397780

personalfinance,Need some help with my finances,"Throwaway for personal info.

So this is going to be pretty generic, but I am going to have a baby in November (Unmarried, 24yo male) and just need some guidance on how to handle things.

Credit score: 730

Savings: $17,300k in a regular savings account I can take out of when I want.

I make $623.14 a week. W-2 contactor, no benefits. (Looking for full-time job now.)

One credit card, paid off in full every month, no fees.

Car loan: $329.52 a month, 4.4% interest. I have about $13k left on that.

Department of Education loans:

$388.44 a month, altogether.

$7,057.11, 6.55%

$6,699.61, 6.55%

$7,496.42	6.55%

$1,551.11	3.15%

$6,400.72	6.55%

$3,580.78	3.61%

Firstmark Student Loans:

$7,349, not sure on interest rate, can't find it.

Car Insurance: $138.80 a month. (Will be turning 25, hopefully will get a discount.)

Phone: $25 a month

Rent: Free for now (living with releative) but when I have the baby, going to get an apartment, which would be about $900 a month.

Will be doing child support payments.

For starters, my dad has suggested to open an IRA with Vanguard. I know that is popular around here, so I'm definitely going to do that.

Car loan: Creditkarma says I can refinance with LightStream and save on that. Also has the option of entering my info in RateGenius.com, which I'm hesitant to do. How easy is it to refinance?

Or: should I just pay it off? That immediately sounds like a bad idea, to me, as it would only leave me about $5k in savings.

Savings account for baby: Any suggestions on where to start one?

Any other guidance? Suggestions? Cutting down on spending currently, but would like to know of some other options.

Any questions, please ask.",finance,1439398357

Long time lurker, first time poster. 
I've done the math and I'm fed up with renting. I've been renting my friends place for a while, and pretty much paid off the mortgage on his short sale with nothing to show for it for me. That lead me to the slightly scary decision to buy.

* I saved a bit for this over the course of my renting and have acquired $12,516 liquid with the ability to get another $4,500. I realize it's not much, but it's what I'm working with. 

* I make about $82,000 a year with quarter bonuses totaling annually $24,000.

I'm locked in with FHA due to a bad credit history. My broker has looked at everything he can, and there's no way we can easily get my score back up to a place where it will qualify for conventional.

* The place I have identified is $198,000. 
* Interest is 4%.
* Putting 3.5% down will cost $6930. 
* Taxes are $3,590.
* The association fee is $660 a month, all utilities and parking are included.
* Mortgage calculator with PITI indicates total monthly cost of $2,013.86
* The place is a short sale and will incur another $4,500 for closing due to this.
* My student loans are $170 a month
* My car is $500 a month
* My insurance is $90 a month

Income

* I make $2,103 after taxes every 2 weeks.
* I will have a roommate paying $500 a month to live in the second bedroom.
* I get a quarterly bonus check that's approximately $3,800 every 45 days after the start of the quarter.

Other points of interest

Come January, I am expect to make senior at my current job which will bump me up at least another $20,000, and increase the annual bonus total to $36,000.

personalfinance,[Request] Best Strategy to Pay Off 30k Debt?,"Hi there,

I decided to freelance coming straight out of college. It was ok for a while—paycheck to paycheck but still making ends meet—though at some point I fell behind and stopped paying cards off in full. I probably averaged 25K a year income. 

I'd float larger purchases on credit with a plan to pay it off when I got paid, but then spend that cash on a  food/travel/life instead of paying off the card. Anyways, no good excuse for me. I was warned about putting things on cards my entire life (and to pay off right away if I ever did) and made these choices knowingly. I've also been super lucky to have a support system behind me that made the fall to completely broke very soft and slow. 

So here's where I'm at as far as debt goes:

* **$7,713** at **17.2% APR** (7,700 limit)

* **$10,400** at **16.9% APR** (10,000 limit) 
 
* **$12,000** personal debt to family. Part from a failed business, and part recent loans to help me get by.

(The personal debt is least priority, but I'd like to make consistent payments for a few hundred a month at least.)

&amp;nbsp;
 
––– living expenses –––

My living expenses are $850/mo rent which isn't going down. (it's good for where i'm living.) I cook for myself mostly and probably spend another $300 on food/groceries. $60 for dog food. Probably the same for gas. I also owe 3–4K in unpaid federal taxes, which are now being paid in $200 monthly payments.

So that's about **$1500/mo total**.

&amp;nbsp;

––– income –––

The good news is that I just accepted a job offer at 80K a year, so I can start knocking this stuff out come September. (Pay will be ~$3,300 per check before withholding, unsure what actual amount will be.) I also have a 2014 model car  purchased outright for 26K that I would not at all mind selling. (I'd need something, so thinking it could be replaced with a ~5-6k used car.)

&amp;nbsp;

**So, what should I pay off first and how should I go about it? Any best strategies for taking care of this? Can I call CC companies and see if APRs can be reduced or is it too late for that to matter? (I've always paid on time.) And should I save a bit up before trying to pay this off?**

Tuition + books runs about 17k per year at this particular school and my financial aid for the year totals around 3400 in grants and 9500 in federal loans for the year (this was increased to 9500 from 4500 because my mother was denied for a parent PLUS loan) I tried to go for a private loan on my own and even with my father as a cosigner, but to no avail due to my credit history being slim, but good and my father's credit scores being sub-par.

I know scholarships are always an option, but they seem like such a volatile, hopeless venture. I've looked at huge lists of scholarships and have applied to the handful that I'm actually eligible for, but nothing has come to fruition.

&gt;[Updated] The Localbitcoins community manager, Max, posted this statement publicly:

  &gt;  We’re sad to say that due to regulators another region has had to be blocked from LocalBitcoins. From today onwards users from New York are no longer allowed to use LocalBitcoins because of the legislation known as the BitLicense (23 NYCRR 200) which makes it a federal offense to sell virtual currency unless you have applied for the license. 

 &gt;This new regulation would require anyone selling Bitcoins through our service to acquire the Bit License if they sell Bitcoins to residents of New York. As the Bit license is time consuming, expensive and difficult to obtain for anything but large companies we’ve taken the decision to protect our US based traders and not allow New York based users to use our service. 

 &gt;If you reside in the US, you will get a one-time pop up notification requiring you to confirm whether or not you live in New York. All new users will equally have to answer the same question.

  &gt;This is an unfortunate state of affairs and we hope that the regulation will in the future accommodate small time bitcoin sellers who do not have the possibility to comply with regulations made for big financial institutions.

personalfinance,"Pay off non-interest accruing, 1.72% interest rate loans, $5K loans during grace period?","Hello good people of personalfinance! 

I have about ~5K in non-interest accruing Federal Stafford loans, currently pegged at 1.72% interest rate. My grace period ends around Christmas (thanks for the Christmas gift, I guess?). 

Here is the situation:

- I have enough money to pay off the loans now.

- I won't be earning any income until the grace period ends anyway. I believe this is the key point, but please do correct me if I'm wrong. I'm by no means a financial expert. 

- I will be applying for job positions around December 2015 or January 2016. If I pay off the loans, I will have enough money to live at my current means until probably March or even April 2016. But not much longer after that. However, I believe I will find a job that pays a decent wage by Spring 2016. I know this is a tough job market, but I feel like I have a good skill set and will be able to earn a liveable wage. 


I'm wondering if I should pay off these loans now? The reason I'm thinking about this is because as I mentioned above: I won't be earning any income right now. The amount of money I have right now is the amount of money I will have when my grace period ends and then I have to begin repaying the loans back. Actually it'll be a little less because of the 3-4 months of living expenses, but you get the idea. There is no cash flow in right now. 

I sort of want to just pay the loan off right now and move on and have a concrete number/budget in my head and plan accordingly. 

Do I get the personalfinance go-ahead?

finance,"When people refer to the student loan debt as a bubble, what the hell are they referring to?","Not sure if this is the right sub but you guys are always insightful so hopefully I don't look like an idiot right now.

If a bubble is created when an asset is traded way over its intrinsic value, and student loans are not collateralized (as far as I know?), aren't dischargeable in bankruptcy (for the most part), and are essentially supported by the federal government, how can this be a bubble?

If anything, wouldn't a college degree be the overpriced asset? And even if it is, I don't see the federal government stopping or even minimizing access to college loans to ""burst"" the ""bubble.""

My parents have offered to buy the house with cash (for a few reasons - quicker closing, more enticing to seller etc) and then somehow sell or transfer to me.  
They do not want to be the lender to us for 30 years so we would need to get it on a traditional mortgage pretty quickly. 

*Here's the question I pose:*  What would be the best way, with fewest fees, for this to happen?  

**For Example**: They buy it outright and then sell it to me.  Probably the cleanest, however it seems there would be 2 sets of closing costs, appraisals etc by taking this route. 

Most of the scenarios we've come up with either a) involve ""gifting"" which they'd like to avoid or b) would require redundant closing costs as illustrated above.  Even if it was purchased by a LLC, I am unsure I could refinance it at a regular interest rate since it's a corporate loan.

I'm seeking advice for my boyfriend. We attend colleges in Virginia, and he goes to a private college. He is a rising senior, and was just told by the college's business office that he cannot come back to school unless he puts down 8,000 dollars (which we definitely cannot do in cash). He has used the maximum amount of federal student loans that he has been allotted, and we are trying to figure out how to cover this money. He has no one to cosign on a private student loan with him.. both of his parents are in no way qualified to do so, and they got denied yesterday anyways when they tried.

I opened an IRA earlier this year, but have only contributed about $2,000 so far, mostly because I'm unsure of what my strategy should be. I'm 26, and feel like I should save for retirement sooner rather than later (to maximize my time in the market), so I'm itching to contribute more to that. But obviously I have a fairly significant loan obligation.

My thought was to pay the minimums on 6, 7, and 8 until they are paid off (or for the next year or two at least, depending on what happens with everything else). I was even going to lump FED 1 in with that plan, since I'm paying less than $30 a year in interest on that. Paying it off early doesn't feel like the best use of my money.

Which brings me to FED 2, 3, 4, and 5. I would love to eliminate one of those. FED 2 is probably most realistic, but I'm unsure how quickly I could do that. I could probably throw $500-1,000 at it in the next month or so. And even if I started paying $100 extra each month, it would *still* take me over a year to pay off that single loan. I feel like I would be sacrificing quite a bit in investing potential by not contributing to my IRA at all during that time. Especially because I'm invested in a Vanguard Target Retirement date fund, which has averaged something like 6.82% over its lifetime (not sure how applicable that is, since it's obviously not an indicator of future performance, but it could out-pace my interest on my loans).

Additionally, we had large profit sharing contributions (this year was $10k!) so at the end of my employment, my employer had actually contributed more than I had. Unfortunately my employer required six years to be fully vested, so I only get to keep 80% of their contributions, even though I was only 6 months away.

Anyways, I'm starting at the Federal Government soon which doesn't offer a 401(k) but has their own TSP (Thrift Savings Program). It is actually a pretty great program, if I put away 5% they match 5%. I can contribute up to 10% of my paycheck but they would still only match 5%. I'm getting a salary bump at this new job, but no more bonuses so my overall compensation is actually going to be less for the first year or so. Because I will have larger bi-weekly paychecks, I plan on starting off with the full 10% and see how that works.

I'm not moving locations and I have enough vacation from my old position that I will continue to receive paychecks through the beginning of employment at my new job (6 weeks off!). I'm pretty sure they will continue to match my 401(k) contributions, but I'm not positive. Once I start at the Fed, I can't enter the TSP program for somewhere between 6-12 months into my employment so my question is what should I be doing in the meantime? I just learned about Roth IRAs recently, and if I've got the money to spare, this seems like a great thing to contribute to while my money isn't going into the TSP. Any other ideas?

personalfinance,"Any advice or encouragement on debt, student loans, home sales is greatly appreciated.","This may get wordy and bounce around a bit. My apologies in advance. I need to get this out of me. (This was also posted to r/personalfinances under a cautionary tale perhaps)

My husband and I have been in serious debt for several years. When we were in our early twenties, prior to me going back to college, we made less money but were able to keep about $5k in savings. We had no debt at that time and we thought we knew what we were doing financially. We bought an older starter home (2005) and got a puppy. I ended up going back to college (2007) to complete my undergraduate degree. Here is where shit got real. Our savings completely dried up at this point due to a series of costly home repairs. Also, I was laid off from my full time job a couple years after going back to college full time. My husband, who worked full time, picked up a part time job where he was working an extra 20 hours or so a week. I ended up finding three part time jobs and still going to school full time, but the loss of my salary &amp; benefits about killed us. We had an emergency credit card for several years that we paid off every month in order to establish credit. During this time, we ended up using the credit card to buy gas and groceries when money got tight but now we couldn't pay off the balance at the end of the month. We also had established a line of credit at our local bank that we used when our roof needed replaced. 

After graduating college (2011), I moved around the country working seasonal jobs to pick up experience in my field, biology. There were times when I used unemployment during the winter when I couldn't find a job. My husband, who understandably was stressed, had a life threatening illness that required him to have emergency surgery.  We didn't have great insurance at the time and we used credit to help pay for it. The doctors told us his problem was definitely stress related and that he was 'burning the candle at both ends' so to speak. Then my 13 year old car broke down. We ended up financing a lightly used, small suv. Our puppy, now ten years old, has gone through two surgeries and requires special dog food. When we were faced with the decision on whether or not to go through with a $200 surgery or $75 euthanization, we chose the surgery. I know $200 doesn't sound like much but when you don't have much it is a big decision. We just couldn't bring ourselves to euthanize our puppy over a difference of $125. But its decisions like this that got us into so much trouble.

Up until this year we have been getting by, pretty much making minimum payments until our income stabilized. I received a job offer in a new state that was semi-permanent. We decided to go for it. We rented out of little starter home and then a few months later put it on the market. We've had it on the market since April, our renter has moved out, and its still not selling. We've dropped the price twice and still no luck.

When we financed our suv, we went through a credit union where we had financed a vehicle several years prior. I've recently been in contact with them about trying to reduce our debt. When I talked to our rep on the phone, I asked her about options. Perhaps opening a personal loan and doing a balance transfer in order to secure a lower interest rate or perhaps a credit card with a balance transfer for our line of credit and credit card. She was hesitant but asked a few questions about if I was missing payments on our loans or if i was trying to increase our credit availability. I explained to her that we ware making payments on a house that we were trying to sell in a different state, also making rent and living payments in our current place, along with the rest of debt and that we really just need some breathing room. She tells me she just got back from a finance convention where the focus was to help people get out of debt. I tell her our credit score was good the last time I checked but it had been several years. She suggest that perhaps I could be her ""guinea pig"". She had me fill out an application and told me she would get back with me.

In the meantime, I'm communicating with another credit union associated with my employer. I actually go into the office and tell the same story and lay everything out. The loan person tells me ""This year our goal is to help people get out of debt!"" I am encouraged by what she tells me but I'm waiting to see what the first CU has to say because I do have an established relationship with them and the communication is always positive.

Here is our debt, minus our home(s). $15000 line of credit (12.99%), $8500 credit card (11.99%), $10000 car loan (2.75%), $33,400 student loan (3-6%)

We have other expenses like gas, groceries, utilities, insurance, cell phones, internet. I have tried to minimalize all non-debt related expenses. We don't go out, pretty much ever. We don't eat fast food. We don't have cable. Lights get turned off when we leave a room. We try to car pool whenever possible, our schedules and destinations can be drastically different frequently.

Here is what we make a month. I am salaried at $2750 per month. He makes about $900 every two weeks.

730 credit score

A week ago our established CU calls me, almost excitedly. She tells me that she has an idea but it won't include the credit card, only the line of credit and the car loan. I didn't consider the car loan because the interest rate is already good. She suggests we consolidate the line of credit and the car loan. She will lower the interest rate to 2.5% on the balance. The catch is that we have to use the equity in our vehicles as collateral. We ended up completing the paperwork and going for it. It saves us about $130 per month. I was telling this CU about the conversation I had with the other CU associated with my employer. She encouraged me to get in touch with them to try to find a better solution for the credit card because it had the potential to save us $60 per month.

I ended up applying for a promotional rate credit card through them with a 4% intro rate and no balance transfer fee for the amount of a ten day payoff on the credit card. I called and left a message with the loan person I spoke with initially. I didn't receive a call back. However, I did get a rejection letter in the mail from them a few days ago. They cited debt vs income and too much non-secure debt. As I'm reading the rejection letter, all I could hear in my mind was the loan rep telling me their focus was on helping reduce debt. What kind of person or debt scenario are they willing to do this for? Either way, I've been turned down here.

I've also been researching Dave Ramsey's Snowball Debt Method and plan to implement it starting with the credit card balance next month. Over the last few months I was able to scrimp and save and have set back about $1000.00 for emergencies.

I've thought about getting a part-time job but my full time position is salaried and varies 40-80hrs per week depending on the weather. The employers I've spoken with haven't been keen on fitting me into their schedules.

I have head analysts say that the currency needs to fall 10 times further than it already has. Nevertheless, the PBoC remains adamant that the Yuan will not be devalued further, nor does it need to be.

The chatter around China will remain and USD will continue to be pressured as the expectations for an early Fed rate hike pare back.

The commodity slump can be credited to China to a larger extend (demand/supply gap), and now this whole fiasco of devaluation means that Asian countries and forex might be in for a surprise ahead.

She encouraged me to get in touch with them to try to find a better solution for the credit card because it had the potential to save us $60 per month.


I ended up applying for a promotional rate credit card through them with a 4% intro rate and no balance transfer fee for the amount of a ten day payoff on the credit card. I called and left a message with the loan person I spoke with initially. I didn't receive a call back. However, I did get a rejection letter in the mail from them a few days ago. They cited debt vs income and too much non-secure debt. As I'm reading the rejection letter, all I could hear in my mind was the loan rep telling me their focus was on helping reduce debt. What kind of person or debt scenario are they willing to do this for? Either way, I've been turned down here.


I've also been researching Dave Ramsey's Snowball Debt Method and plan to implement it starting with the credit card balance next month. Over the last few months I was able to scrimp and save and have set back about $1000.00 for emergencies.


I've tried getting a part-time job but my full time position is salaried and varies 40-80hrs per week depending on the weather. The employers I've spoken with haven't been keen on my schedule.


Is there anything else I can do?

personalfinance,Going all Ally? Good or bad idea.,"Hi everyone, looking for some advice. Currently have a joint checking and saving with Ally, and I love it. I am looking to leave my local credit union (many people in the area are, they are not what they once were) and was wondering if there are any cons to going 100% Ally. I am looking to open checking and savings. I withdraw about $50 in spending cash a week, and cannot remember the last time I had to deposit cash.

Does anyone have experience with both joint and personal accounts on Ally? I'm assuming I would have 2 Ally cards? Do they offer any cards besides the standard purple ones? I wouldn't want to mix the joint and personal cards up accidentally.

I have also considered opening schwab or capital one 360 accounts to keep joint/personal separate. I have a capital one quicksilver card and a discover card if that matters. Currently leaning towards Ally because of interest rates and the fact I have already had great experiences with them.

Currently I'm a contractor working in HR for a large Utility company; but like any contractor, I am worried about month to month bills (fe, my student loans).
Anyway, my mother has offered to take a portion of life insurance and the benefits she is receiving from his military career and his post-mili intel contracting career to assist with paying off my 50k in student debt. about half of that has a 8-9% interest rate. The other has a pretty low interest rate.

I'm looking into different ways to get out of debt ""faster"" and would like some advice. I currently make ~$66k/year, but have a car payment along with student loan payments + emergency savings and retirement savings. I know that from a strictly financial view, I'm losing money by saving at lower interest rates than by paying off higher interest rate CC debt. However, having an emergency fund is key and with retirement savings I've heard that the earlier you start, the better. The two main ways I've considered are:

**Getting a personal loan at a lower APR to pay off the current balances:** 

I've been accepted for a Lending Club loan for $14,000 at an APR of 9.97% with a repayment plan of 3 years at $438/month. This was the best deal I have found with a day or two of searching and is doable. 

**Opening a new credit card with 0% transfer APR**

There are multiple credit cards out there that I would most likely be approved for that would offer a 0% balance transfer for 12-15 months with an origination fee of 3%. The plan with this card would just be for balance transfer, not to use it as a card.

As for plans after this, I would be putting my credit cards away, in a dresser drawere, etc. I would be only using cash or debit, whichever turns out to be better for me.

* Called lenovo customer support and they got my laptop to boot over the phone, but after explaining the persisting issues and expressing my desire to have it sent in for a warranty checkup.  I was told to wait 24hrs before attempting to do so

* Happened again and sent it in (was going to call it in regardless but it actually did happen again even though it was a rare occurrence).  Was told after they got my laptop in the mail that it would take up to 8 business days to fix.

* After getting my laptop they told me they confirmed the laptop was broken, but they did not have the parts to properly fix it and wouldnt for another 2 months.  Instead they offered to give me a brand new laptop of the same make and model. They also offered to replace the hard drive with the one from my currently broken computer, effectively fixing the issue with no loss of my information.  They also offered to send me the hard drive that was being replaced with the old one (free 512G SSD? hell yeah!).

* After confirming they would replace the hard drive from my old laptop with the hard drive on the new one, they asked for the password to my hard drive to login and check it after replacing it to make sure nothing was corrupted or lost.

Up until now I was fairly happy with how they were handeling their consistent fuckups.  I was definitely irritated, but understood the issues and tried to be patient. Then this happened. 

* They asked where to send the laptop and I told them my houses address, the problem is they didnt tell me that to get the package required somebody 21 or older to sign for it and i work 8-5.  If i had known this I would have sent it to my work, instead I had to go to FedEx to pick it up after work and the location was an hour away (1 way) from my work.

Instead of notifying me to tell methis, they decided to go ahead and replace the hard drives anyway, and send me the laptop.  They also told me I should have received a 2nd hard drive (which i didnt) and that they would look into what happened and send me a 2nd hard drive.

/u/AlexanderNigma suggested this link, which does a pretty good job of explaining it – see *COMPOUND INTEREST WITH MONTHLY CONTRIBUTIONS - FORMULAE*: http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/finance/compound-interest-formula.php

Essentially, it's like this (assuming that the contribution and compounding intervals are equal periods of time):

[ P(1+r/n)^nt ] + [ PMT * (((1 + r/n)^nt - 1) / (r/n)) ]

P = the principal investment amount  
PMT = the n-thly payment  
r = the annual interest rate

Well lesson learned, I should've chosen my words much better, and I got called out on my last post for it. Fair enough, in the end I'm trying to guide myself and my gf into a financially stable future, and I have temporarily taken over both of our finances. 

So me and the gf (soon to be fiance!!! Shhh, I just ordered the ring!) made a whole week of really getting a handle on each other's finances, and I'm happy to say it's come a long way since I made my first post. 

- The debt in her old checking was $1000, not $1500 as I originally thought, we took an entire paycheck of hers to the bank, paid it off, and closed the account. 

- She opened up a new account through the credit union I use in addition to a new credit card (bills and emergencies only), she was able to refinance her car and had the debt on her discover card (a little over $2600) lumped in with it, which makes her car payments higher BUT it massively lowered the interest rate of the debt, so her discover card is paid off. The interest rate is about 4.53%, so that's nice. 

- I'll be paying off my B of A card (about $600) in fall with a chunk of my student loans. 

- I have started making $25 payments on all my unsub student loans that I currently have, which is three of them. My goal is to do this for every unsub loan I have. I still have three years of school left so I should make a serious dent in the interest and principle of these loans by the time I graduate. 

- We'll be dividing the bills every month among our credit cards (we each have two) and never exceeding a 1/3 of our approved credit line, paying them off before the posting date.

personalfinance,I can get a better HSA interest rate if I select an option that's not insured by the FDIC. Should I?,"Maybe-six-months lurker, first-time poster. I love this subreddit. It makes me feel empowered to gain control over my money and my spending and my future.


My question: My company offers an HSA as part of their health care program. It has a tiered interest rate system that looks like this:

* I earn 0.05 percent if my balance is $2,000 or less.
* I earn 0.1 percent if my balance is between $2,000 and $7,500.
* I earn 0.2 percent if my balance is between $7,500 and $10,000.
* I earn 0.4 percent if my balance exceeds $10,000.


The HSA is offering me the option of a ""Yield Plus"" group annuity funding agreement. It is ""provided and backed by a third-party insurer"" named ""Great Western Insurance Company."" They state clearly that this agreement is:

* Not a deposit
* Not FDIC insured
* Not insured by any federal government agency
* Not guaranteed by the bank
* May go down in value


If I choose this ""Yield Plus"" option, my interest rates are changed to:

* I earn 0.1 percent if my balance is $2,000 or less.
* I earn 0.25 percent if my balance is between $2,000 and $7,500.
* I earn 1 percent if my balance is between $7,500 and $10,000.
* I earn 1.5 percent if my balance exceeds $10,000.


If I've learned two things since joining this subreddit community, it's that compound interest is king and legal safety is king, too. So here I am with a chance at a higher compound interest rate at the expense of legal safety.  What should I do?

personalfinance,(CAN) Around $40K in student loans but I have some savings - Pay lump sum or invest?,"Hi PF, 

Long time lurker here who is finally approaching my first legitimate PF issue that I could use some advise on. Do I pay off a large chunk of student loans or invest that money and pay of the loan over a longer time?

Some background for those who might not be aware of how the canadian student loan system works: If you qualify for a NSLSC student loan, the government pays for the interest of the loan for as long as you remain a full-time student. 

Getting my undergrad degree I ended up with ~$40,000 (CAD) in student loan debt. I went directly into a PhD. program. I received a (very modest) stipend and I lived frugally so I have been able to save some money during this time and have continued interest-free since. More recently, I have received a few higher valued scholarships so I currently have ~$20,000 (CAD) saved. I finish my degree in a couple weeks and that means that my interest-free period will be over and the $40K loan starts to collect interest on September 1. I've already landed an entry level job in my field (low pay but expected to lead to my dream career with better pay quickly).

Stats:

* Loan Balence: $40,000
* Interest rates: Prime + 2.5% (floating), Prime + 5% (fixed)
* Current Canadian Prime = 2.7%
* Savings: $20,000
* Gross income: $48,000
* Estimated yearly cost of living: $38,000 - $42,000 (total budget + taxes, etc.)
* No CC debt or any other debts / expected big purchases soon

So should I dump a chunk of my savings to pay off the principle before it starts to collect interest or am I better off investing that money and paying the loan back over time? 

I guess it boils down to if investing can outpace the interest (currently 5.2%) rate of the  loan?",finance,1439501592
financialindependence,Where should I put my money???,"Hello - I've always been very personal finance focused, but just found this forum.  Curious to get some thoughts from you guys on where I should send my extra money.  

First, a little about me:  34 yo male, married with a 6 month old son.  Wife is not working for now, as we can afford that.  I have a pretty solid job and salary that leaves me with about $3K per month leftover after all expenses to use towards achieving FI.  I fully fund my 401K to the max, and fully fund Roth IRAs (via the backdoor Roth) for both me and my wife.  I'm funding $150/month to my son's 529 plan.  I have life insurance.  I have about $100K as a liquid emergency fund (side question, is this too much?).  Me and a partner invest in real estate when we find good deals and we will close on our 15th unit next month.  I don't have access to an HSA through work.

No CC debt as I pay it off every two weeks, but have three pieces of debt:
$389K mortgage at 4.125% on a 30 year fixed; 
$17K auto loan at 1.9% (I know a lot will say pay this off, but the interest rate is great);
$6K furniture loan at 0% (same as above)

Here are what I see as my options with my $3K/month (note:  I will continue to invest in real estate when deals arise, but assume for this exercise I don't have a deal at the time):
1) Pay off debt above;
2) Put more in savings (already $100K there which may be too much);
3) Pay more in the 529 plan (don't want to get too crazy with this, as I could lose the money);
4) Taxable investment account (I already have about $50K in an account right now).  I do love the idea of dividend investing for passive income.;
5) I have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan at my company (S&amp;P 500) in which I can buy up to $25K of stock/year at a 10% discount.  I'm currently investing about $5K/year into this.  This is almost like free money, assuming the stock doesn't go down, but it also increases risk because my job, healthcare, income, and this stock is all tied up in my company.  I think we will be around for years to come, but diversification does cross my mind.

Curious what other ideas you may have, and what your thoughts are.

My goal is to be financially independent as early as possible without killing myself along the way.  I'm 22 years old (not sure if that's relevant, but I'm including it nonetheless).


* I have $20k in cash sitting in the bank
* I have $10k in my Roth invested in various companies (just recently picked up a bunch of oil stock--figure oil will rebound within a year or two)
* I have $10k in a trading account that I mess around with until I need it for the next down payment (this will make sense once you finish reading the list)
* After all expenses I'm netting $800/mo (this is after I pay into my vacation fund, annual property taxes etc.)  This number is low because I'm renovating my house right now
* I own a rental property worth $210,000 with $110,000 left on the mortgage.  Monthly payment is $850 (includes taxes and insurance) and I collect $1,175 in rent
* I own my own home as well, worth $170,000 with $150,000 left on the note.  Monthly payment is $1,020 (includes taxes and insurance)
* I own 20% of a small business where I am also employed


I've spent the last 13 months fixing up the house that I live in with the intention of buying another house and renting this one out.  By doing it that way, I'm able to get a lower interest rate (owner occupied) and put less down on the property (don't have to sink 20% into the property).


I plan on repeating the cycle of buying a house, living in it/fixing it up for a year and then renting it out until I have 6 properties (one to live in and 5 to rent out).  These numbers may change, but that's the current plan.  I figure I could live off of $50k/yr in passive income from these properties once they are paid off AND have the ability to liquidate one or more in the event that I need cash fast.

I owe 87k in student loans (7.5% averaged interest rate, so my payment is about $1080/month). I am trying to figure out how much I should put towards retirement vs. student loans. My job has a 403b plan, but they do not start contributing (3%) until I have been there for 12 months. I’m 28f and likely won’t retire for at least 40 years, and even then I imagine I will still work part-time. However, I know I could become chronically ill, disabled, or just burnt out, and so I should plan as such and assume I will not want to work much past the age of 68.

Anyway, after calculating my budget (I live in an extremely high cost of living area with very high taxes), I have about $1600 leftover each month. I currently have 6k in savings. I really want to pay down my student loans as fast as possible, but I also feel like I should at least put something into the 403b, and maybe beef up my savings as well.

Effective Interest Rate| 7.125%
First Payment Due Date | 08/2008
Monthy Payment P&amp;I | $1,069.25

So basically, I've been here 7 years,  paying $1,069 a month, so I've paid about $90,000 so far on a $158,000 loan, but only  $15,000 of that is towards the principal.


I would like to refinance the house, for two reasons. I bought it with my ex, and we are amicably separated. I've been paying the mortgage the whole time, but she is on the mortgage. She doesn't want to be on it, and I don't want her on it. So I'd like to have it in just my own name. But, my credit isn't great, about 650, at best, according to Credit Karma. 



So I'm thinking about refinancing. Mostly to have the house in my name, but if I could get a better rate great.

But so if somehow that were possible, what would happen then? Would I start a whole new loan with a whole new company and pay them another $100,000+ also? Or does the interest I've paid so far some how apply to the refinance? I've paid $75,000 in just interest so far, so it would be a shame to just throw that away to start over with someone else.

I know this isn't ideal, but it is what it is. This is in Colorado, and with the housing market being what it is here right now I also have the option of just selling the home for about $250,000. Houses in my neighborhood aren't even staying on the market for more than a week before selling, sometimes same day or next day. Denver real estate is ridiculous right now. I'm not underwater or upside down by any means, even with the shitty interest, but obviously I'd like to make the best of a crappy situation.

I am hoping that I can get some clear guidance for my situation that I will find myself in in less than a month. I will be graduating with a Masters in Accounting in less than a month, and I already have a job lined up in a major city with one of the Big 4 accounting firms. My pay will be $65,000 annually to begin with, excluding any bonuses. I worked for them as an intern for 5 months and have saved up roughly $15,000 during my time in college. My grandparents also told me they will be giving me $5,000 for my graduation. I have no dependents (other than my dog :) ), and I will be graduating with no student loans to my name.

In the city that I will be relocating to the rent in the general area I am looking at is right around $2,000/month due to the fact it is downtown (I do not want a long commute and I want to live downtown while I'm young). I plan to be in this city for the foreseeable future, because the companies I'm auditing very well could end up being my future employer, and most of them are in this city. I have been looking at apartments that would suite my needs (just 1 bedroom and 1 bath) and most are around $325,000 to purchase, and while I know that Zillow can be very inaccurate, it estimates the mortgage payment to be $1,700.

I hope at this point you can see where I'm coming from: I plan to be here a while, the mortgage seems to be less than the rent, and I would prefer to be paying on something I will own with some of it going to interest than all my money flowing into someone else's pocket. In my situation, is it possible to qualify for a mortgage for this amount? I understand that my limited work experience may take a hit at me, but I have great credit, I'm fairly certain my parents who net roughly $200,000 annually would co-sign for me, and I am not completely opposed to higher interest rates if it means that I can just refinance somewhere down the road.

stocks,Pay back loans or invest in stocks/funds?,"Hi guys.

I've recently graduated uni, and while I've got roughly $40k in student debt, I have about half that (20k) sitting in my bank account. I'm considering what my best option is; pay some of the loan back, or invest it?

These are the facts: 

- My student loan's interest rate is only at 2%(!)
- The interest is currently frozen at 0% and doesn't start ticking for another 6 months.
- I might go back to uni for a master's degree in 12 months, meaning the interest will be re-frozen to 0% for 2 more years.

In other words, the loan isn't really growing at the moment, and won't start to grow for a few years.

I realize that in some cases, one should pay back one's loans before even considering investing in stocks or funds. However, given the specifics of my situation, and considering how cheap my loan is, wouldn't you think that investing the cash in an index/mutual fund, or stocks would be worth the risk?

With yearly returns of 7% (deducting 29% taxation) that would yield a return of $3195 over 3 years. A return of 12% would yield a return of ~$5700. All the while, those 6 months of interest on the loan would cost me only $400.

I'm also making a new post as most FAQ from the toolbar are highly US specified.

For comparison a bought out budget 1 room appartment (which is far more common thing to do than renting one) costs around 50k here and 500$ a month considered a fairly normal pay. 

Currently I may afford a decent 3-4 year old car and an appartment and leave some money for myself if I stay in the country, but I don't want to blow it all and  was always aiming on leaving my homeland and live abroad.   

What I am interested is, whether there are ways to secure my money abroad and make them work and give profit long term if I stay here, like deposit of sorts (we have really high % interest rates of like 30% in country currency but it looses value extremely fast and it's a common thing to keep money in $US for which interest rates are 4-5% and you still can't be sure that your money is safe). Or if there is a great way to move somewhere like US or EU country that will also help me benefit from that money. 

So far the plan is to buyout a relatively cheap appartment to have a place and a roof to live (its a pretty commong thing here to be afraid to loose ""a place to live"" since renting is more of a new tradition) no matter what happens and spend the rest of money to try to move abroad, mostly US was always a target. But I feel like there may also be better things to do with that fair, but not extremely huge amount of money.

personalfinance,How do I go about a balance transfer to a new credit card if the limit is not high enough.,"So in my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3f64qe/how_can_i_pay_off_my_credit_card/) post I was given the advice to move my high interest credit debt into a new card with a zero percent interest rate to pay off my credit card debt with bank of america.   My debt is $5000, I also mentioned previously that I saved $2000 in cash.  The new card I applied for and got approved for is the citi simplicity card with 21 months interest free and $0 fee for first balance transfer. The **problem** is I only received a $2000 credit limit.  How do I go about using this card in trying to pay off the bank of America card without using 100% of the new limit.  I was thinking of using the $2000 cash to add onto the new cards limit and that would make it $4000 total then I'd transfer $3500 pay that off then pay off the remaining $1500 with another balance transfer after I'm done paying the first 3500.  Does seem right? If I just got my new approval can I ask for an increase in the limit? My bank of America card has a $10,000 limit. If I had at least 7-8k limit I would be able to pay off transferred debit before the 21 months ends and it would be with no interest. What should I do?",finance,1439563671
news,How Does a Second Mortgage (Secured Loan) Work?,"A 2nd mortgage is a secured loan which is subordinate to the first mortgage against the same property. While there is no restriction on how you use the amount obtained from a second mortgage in Toronto, there are some common scenarios in which homeowners take out this type of loan, such as for funding home improvements, children’s education, debt consolidation, emergency expenses like medical bills, etc.
Types of Second Mortgages
There are two types of second mortgages – “Home Equity Loans” &amp; “Home Equity Line Of Credit(HELOC)”. In a home equity loan, the amount of money you get is based on your home’s equity (difference b/w your home’s appraised value &amp; the total amount you obtain from your mortgage). There is a fixed time period to pay back the loan amount in the form of monthly installments. A home equity line of credit, on the other hand works more like a credit card. This means you’ll have a certain credit limit which can be reused while you pay back the balance. This type of loan has a variable interest rate &amp; no fixed term.
Qualifying For A 2nd Mortgage
To qualify for any type of 2nd mortgage in Toronto, you need to have more than 20% of equity in your house. Besides that, you should be able to make timely monthly payments on the mortgage without exceeding TDS (Total-Debt-Service). Even those with a low credit score are eligible for obtaining a 2nd mortgage, however at an interest rate higher than those with a better score. Lenders also consider factors like how long you have been working in your present company. This allows them to determine whether or not you would be able to keep up with the mortgage payments. Although the employment history of the borrower is vetted carefully, a recent period of unemployment would not disqualify you as lenders are familiar with the unstable job market. However, when you apply for a 2nd mortgage, you should have a job in hand. The fact that you are currently working will assure the lenders that you would be able to repay the loan amount. Typically, you have to show your employment history of last 6 months and sometimes more.
Key Considerations
Before applying for a second mortgage, be sure that you’ll be able repay the loan amount within the specified time frame. As taking out a 2nd mortgage means you will have to pay monthly installments for a fixed period of time, it is important that you thoroughly assess your monthly expenses &amp; obligations beforehand. Also, take into account the risks involved in this long-term loan commitment as well as the costs associated with opening &amp; maintaining the loan. Some of these expenses may include closing costs, home appraisal cost, &amp; annual fees. To make sure you are not denied the loan, try to maintain a good credit score. There are many homeowners who often turn to a bad credit mortgage in Toronto because of their poor credit score.",finance,1439564941

personalfinance,"Career Grad Student, Student/Credit Debt","Just looking for a bit of advice. My situation isn't dire, as I still have great credit and am starting to get more income coming in, but I'd like some advice. 

I graduated with my undergrad with about $7,000 in student debt.
I did a graduate degree last year, which at the end of the day left me with around $25,000 in student debt between student loans and student line of credit. I was in a bit of a credit mess coming out of undergrad (a mix of silly spending and debt acquired from going on an academic exchange), and I offloaded a bit of it on to my student line of credit, which offered a far better interest rate. Someone smart advised me to do this, I'm not sure if it was BS or not.  

It was a sparsely funded program, and due to some personal issues and the requirement that my research had me travelling quite a bit, I couldn't work a job on the side. On top of the roughly $25,000 in SD, I also have $3,000 on my credit card, which I do pay down slowly, but which had some urgent type payments (busted computer, stuff like that) on it, and which has also just slowly built up over time. I'd really like to get that dealt with. That's my background that I'm starting from, with a bank account balance of ~$1,000 right now, with $1,300 in accrued income that should be paid in the next week or two for freelance work.  

Here's my future situation: 

I'm moving to do another graduate degree, which will cost ~$3,300 per term, but when a scholarship is applied it's only about $2,000 per term. I've been approved for student loans of $18,000. 

Monthly rent: $650~, with internet and hydro and all that. 
Transport: $125/month metropass
Food: ~$200/month (I eat pretty lightly).
Phone: recently downgraded my plan to $50/month
Misc: various services I pay for total ~$100/month. 
Income: I work a freelance editing job for a major business publishing house, so I make a decent wage -- in the month of July, while working on it on the side, I billed $975 while working full-time on my thesis, so there is some definite earning potential there. As well, I worked a weekend job at a restaurant which, though it didn't pay me a great deal, did get me out of the house and will make it easier to get another job when I move. I would estimate my monthly earnings right now at ~$1200/month from this job. I am hoping to get a TA position, which will provide more income, and am considering getting a serving job as well. 

Goals: I'd like to get my credit card debt handled. I can stomach some student debt, and a student line of credit, as those are investments in my post-degree future, but I would like to pay into them as much as I can, if I can. At the moment I pay $100 every two weeks into a savings account that I use to either pay down some credit card debt or student loan debt, but that's sort of a drop in the bucket. 

What I'm really looking for is someone to try to make sense of this, and what I should be focusing on and doing to manage my income and outflows to both be comfortable living in an expensive city and to not screw myself any further for the future.

I just inherited $25,000 and would like advice on what I should do with it. I've listed below my biggest monthly expenses. I still like at home, mostly because of the large student loans payments I make every month. I am on Income Based Payments with the Federal loans. I recently enrolled in ""extended pay"" with the private loans (this took the payments from $525/mo. to $311/mo.) The extended pay plan is new to my monthly bills. Prior to this, I was in forbearance for 12 mo. and wasn't paying anything. As of two months ago, I am paying the private loans, montly. I have been going into my personal savings to make this happen so I am living beyond my means with this new monthly payment.
I've considered paying off my car and credit cards to free up $400/mo.
I've considered taking the full $25k and putting it towards my private loans just to try and tackle that beast.
I'd like to save some of it but I don't know if using it all is the better option.
I would really appreciate any opinions on this and I do appreciate anyone who takes the time to open and read my post.

The first thing is I'm not having any federal withholding taken out of my paycheck every week. I haven't requested for this to happen so I'm not sure why it is. Do I simply make too little money for them to withhold any, or is my employer messing up? Am I going to be hit at the end of the year with owed money because of this?

Next is regarding vacation time. It has never been explicitly stated that I have vacation time earned but on my paystub I have acquired some time added up. When I tried asking about it I was basically laughed at and told that vacation was only for the higher ups and to ignore it on my pay stubs. Is what they're doing legal and proper/correct? Should I try and pursue it or do I heed their advice and just ignore it?

I've been going through EnergySage, and was only able to get these two quotes. I get the sense there's a big rush and people are booked up with the tax credit expiring.

The southern energy quote is quite a bit higher. However, they seem to be a really established company. They came out and did an assessment, whereas the Emerald Energy was just a message through EnergySage. I saw a picture of the installed panels from Southern Energy, and they looked pretty sleek, which is important with my HOA; they will be visible from the front of the house. I imagine I could get Emerald to switch to those panels if I wish.

I'm not sure what is going to happen to all the local solar companies with the federal and state tax credits expiring - I imagine prices will fall, demand will drop and some smaller guys could go out of business.

I'm not sure how important it is if anything happens to the company - I don't know if it's worth an extra 50% to go with a bigger company. I don't know too much about the quality of the hardware and components.

investing,Equity Committee hearing coming up in major bankruptcy tied to $APPL ($GTATQ),"EQ Holders Must Bleed Together

There are some equity holders on this board who have not printed up and mailed this very important supporting document at http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/uLhzJPau/file.html
 (Support for Appointment of Equity Committee)

and the deadline is quickly approaching.

Let's look at the facts.

People SUPPORT the equity committee:

•Dr. Nidal Abdel-Rahman, MD, Medical Practitioner, Assistant Professor of Clinical Anesthesiology

•Paul E. Boldt

•F.C. Salzmann

•Chad Cooper

•Members of the Equity Committee itself, among them counted:

•The Honorable Doug Southard, retired federal judge.

•Professional and family man Nathan Cottrell

•Mike Willingham

**Mike Willingham's membership is of special interest.** He is the legendary pro-se filer who lead a team of men and women in the fight for equity holders after the historic bankruptcy of Washington Mutual during the 2008 global financial crises.

Mike and his team's work resulted in tens of millions of dollars of equity shares being preserved. Those few millions of dollars of equity is now worth over $500,000,000 dollars and retain claims to billions of dollars of assets. 

The $WMIH case is largely settled, and equity holders were successfully preserved.

Join the real hustlers who are putting in work. Don't cow-tow to the opinions of king(queen)pins of message boards who cloak and subvert with downvotes on messages that they disagree with.

There is a pending hearing on the 27th of August 2015 for what will likely be the final opportunity for Shareholders (termed in federal bankruptcy cases as ""Equity Security Holders"") to achieve representation during this case! This case is 9 months in and the first ""Plan of Reorganization"" -- the final step to exiting bankruptcy -- will soon be filed.

From my experience face-to-face with the parties to this case (GTAT -- termed, ""the Debtors"", The Bondholders (termed, ""the creditors""), and the presiding judge, it is certain that letters to the court in support of the Equity Security Holder's petition for the appointment of a Committee of Equity Security Holders  will create a bigger opportunity for such a committee to be formed!

You as a shareholder of GT Advanced Technologies, et al. will then have paid legal representation during these hearings.

If we fail to support the legal professionals, investment analysis professionals, and volunteer team of equity holders who are working to get us paid representation (the aforementioned professionals have worked since Februrary, completely pro-bono so far), what are we but worms waiting to be eaten by the bureaucratic machine?

Therefore, if you are a shareholder in $GTATQ, it is in your best interest to download this Wordpad document and print it. Read the document and put your name on it. Then Date and Sign the document. Write the address of the document onto a normal letter-sized envelope with a U.S. Postal Service stamp. Finally, place the document into the envelope and mail it.

Do this today or your letter will not arrive in time to be considered during the August 27th hearing.

Some background - my monthly take home pay after taxes, fees, insurance, 401k is about 6k.  I currently pay 1690 in rent and have 80k in student loans at an average of 6.3% interest rate.  

I'm looking to buy a condo (HoA fees, yay) and can take out up to a 350k loan at a 3.125% interest rate over 15 years.  I only need about 220k of that for the condo.  The overall cost of the property would be 650k.

My options now are:    

1) Take money from the down payment and pay off all my student loans (would still be &gt;20%). Take out 300k in mortgage loan.     

2) Refinance student loan to 5% over 10 years.  Monthly payments would be around 850.     

3) Refinance student loan to 3.99% over 5 years.  Pay less interest over time but monthly payments would be 1500 :(.

The goal is to add some uncorrelated assets to my stock portfolio. In this falling interest rate environment, I don't feel long term bonds or junk bonds are very good investments. Stocks historically have better returns with lower standard deviation. And short-term bonds are almost a cash investment, in my eyes. I might as well keep the money in an Ally savings account earning 1% risk-free. But intermediate term bonds seem a great middle ground. They seem a decent bet to beat inflation, and possess enough oomph to potentially offset stock market losses.

My fear is that I'll eventually run out of federal student loans before I'm done and all my work over the years will be wasted. I don't think I have the assets to take out any private student loans, as the requirements seem unrealistic to college students. I don't have any family or friends I can use for co-signers.

I am a 19M attending a tech school right now for a Networking Specialist Degree, I plan to get the CCNA cert once I finish my Cisco Courses. I have 2 semesters of college left. A job fell into my lap in April working for my local ISP. My job title is ""Network Operator"" and my duties include: Maintaining the computers/equipment (routers,switches, etc) for our 2 buildings, tier 2 tech support for customers, setting up and maintaining equipment in the CO (servers, switches, routers). Configuring and installing home routers for customers, and keeping records. My job has me doing a bunch of different things, which I really enjoy and I do them well. I've had a few people tell me they were going to put in word that I should get a pay raise. 

When I filled out my application; I asked my friend, who has a tier 1 tech support jobs at another ISP in our area, how much he made an hour. He makes $12.90/hr. When I was in my second interview, my now supervisor asked me if I was okay with being paid $12 an hour full time. In hindsight I should've asked for a bit more but  I was excited to be getting a job in my field, plus I don't have a degree yet, and I was currently living very strapped working 20 hours a week at FedEx.

Because of my current college schedule I cannot work 40 hours a week, which is what my employer considers full time. I usually get around 35 hours a week as long as class doesn't get delayed. I'm stuck with having class on Monday and Wednesday morning until I graduate, with no ability to make up the 5 hours a week. However, since I'm part time I don't get any of the following benefits: Dental care, PTO, holiday pay, retirement fund. I just now got basic health insurance because of a new regulation with Obamacare.

My question is how can I ask for a raise? My supervisor told me that if they hire someone new then they can give a raise after a few months, and that raises are typically given at the end of the year. I've not been late to work once, and only asked for one day off because of a death in the family. I feel that I'm getting shafted because of the low (I think?) amount of money I'm making hourly and the lack most of the possible benefits I could be making.

I live in the South East US, cost of living is really low. I'm making plenty of money to live and buy just about anything I want and still put $200 minimum in savings a month. I usually save closer to $300-$400 a month. I'm not hurting for money in the least, but I feel like I'm not making as much as I could be.

personalfinance,How much should I be spending on rent per month? Can anyone help me set up a budget?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I am a 22 year old recent college grad working my first job. Everything was going well, until I got my first paycheck today, and had much more taken out in taxes then I had planned. I make $40,000 base with a $5000 bonus, so $45000 a year. I received my first paycheck for three weeks of work (usually done every two weeks but I started at a middle period). My paycheck for three weeks was $2307, after taxes $1753. So when all is said and done, I will only be making about $2333 per month (before the additional bonus) and that is before even more federal taxes.

I just got a new car, and payments are about $250 a month, plus $160 for insurance (I am shopping around to find lower rates). I currently live with my mom rent free, but I want to move out soon. Now here is the good news, with this new paycheck, I have a little over $33,000 in savings and no student loans. However, I look at this more as money for my future, I want to avoid spending any of it. However, I may take a little bit out for some furniture/ emergencies.

So with what I am pulling in each month, how much should I be spending on rent? Also, what should I do with my quarterly bonuses ($1250)? Should those go to more savings or is it ok to spend it on rent? I won't be able to get a roommate (don't know a lot of people in the same position or area) so it will be more expensive. The cheapest ""decent"" one bedroom I found was $900. I am worried this is too much. Is getting a nice place impossible without taking out of my savings?

personalfinance,Should windfall be used for buying a reasonable house or should it be invested and use interest to pay monthly mortgage notes?,"My mother just received a $123,000 401k in my parents divorce, and she is planning on selling her property which is valued at roughly $135,000. Other than these two larger assets she has very little that is worth more than a couple of thousand dollars.

She is 59, living on roughly $500/month from disability as well as $2500/month for the next 6 years as part of the divorce decree. She plans on moving from the country into a more suburban area and will be looking to spend no more than $135,000 on a house. 

My question is this: would it be better to get a mortgage to pay for the house while interest rates are still around 3-4%, and invest all of those monies and pay the mortgage with the interest made...or use the amount made from the sale of her property to pay for the house in full?

personalfinance,Considering refinance from 30y FHA to 15y conventional,"My wife and I are considering refinancing our home loan.  We currently make $181,000.00 a year before taxes.  She makes $4785.56 a month after taxes, and I make $5385.52 a month after taxes.  According to the county, our house is currently worth $398,000.00.

Our current loan:

*     30 year FHA
*     $333,841.00
*     3.25%
*     $338.65 for mortgage insurance
*     A monthly payment of $2,323.87

We've been paying this loan for 3 years and we currently owe $314,187.09.  After using a loan calculator on our banks webpage, it looks like we could afford to refinance to a 15 year fixed rate conventional loan at the same interest rate.

Refinanced loan:

*    15 year conventional
*    $315,000.00 (rounded up for ease on loan calculator)
*    3.25%
*    A projected monthly payment of $2,693.48 (but I figure it will be closer to $3000.00 because it's estimating our property taxes about $250 too low
*    Closing costs of $7,385.31

Would something like this be a good idea for my wife and I?  We are conceivably cutting off 12 years of interest, and removing our mortgage insurance, but will have a higher monthly payment, and the closing costs.

personalfinance,Need help trying to get back to school.,"A lot of things happened my first year of college which led to me being in a financial struggle.

Currently I owe $3,000 to my old University which has put a hold on my transcript, preventing me from getting financial aid at a local community college. I do not have the money to pay this off in full, it would take me at least a few months to get to that point. I know the most simple course would just be to work until I can pay it off, but every month I'm not in school I am being charged for my $9,000 in federal loans. Getting left behind all my friends is also impacting me emotionally, so I'd really like to get back to school this semester.

So anyways, what I would like to do is set up a payment plan, preferably around $200 a month to pay off the $3,000 I owe my old university, so that I can have my transcripts sent to my community college and enroll in classes this semester. I contacted my University and they told me that they can't release them until account is paid in full and that my loan has been collected by a place called the Credit Bureau Services Association who are surprisingly difficult to contact.

My question is if there are any options that would allow me to pay off the $3,000 through another business and make reasonable monthly payments to them so that I may have the transcript hold removed and return to College this semester?",finance,1439585406
gaming,"Tour de France 2015 is far and away the crudest video game I've ever played on a new gen console. But by golly, this piece of shit has earned my respect.","I've always loved sports games and have a tendency to buy them no matter how crappy they are. With just about every game I adjust the difficulty according to my skill but find myself stuck between a difficulty mode where I always win, and a mode where I never win (looking at you, Fifa) no matter how hard I try, or how much I read and watch about getting better. This inevitably leads to me always winning, getting bored, and putting the game down.

Enter the Tour de France series. I've always been fascinated by cycling for its combination of ungodly athleticism and intricate tactics, but my fandom has always been pretty causal. I'll watch the Giro or the Dauphine if I remember that it's on, or come across highlights, but for the most part I only watch the Tour de France. So my knowledge of the sport and its participants is pretty basic. I can name the big riders, a couple legends, and have a rudimentary understanding of tactics. But that's it.

I say all this because by all accounts TdF 2015 should have been just another sports game for me. I started out playing the normal game mode on Amature difficulty, choosing Team Sky and winning the Tour on my first attempt. I then bumped it up to Intermediate difficulty and got my ass handed to me. Standard.

So I decided to try the team mode, where you're given an awful team, no budget, and have to participate in two lead up races in order to qualify for the Tour de France. Placing well in one of the many categories pro cycling is judged by gets your team more money that you can spend on buying new riders at the end of each season. So I chose Amature difficulty again and was on my way. But this time it wasn't easy. Because my team was so shit, I wasn't able to sprint away to victory every time. Even on the lowest difficulty, I had to get tactical. And with so few people playing a game like this, I couldn't just go online and find a guide on how to win. I had to figure it out on my own.

After three seasons I had placed well enough in the first two races, and bought enough mediocre riders, to qualify for the Tour de France. But that still wasn't good enough. My meagre team could barely even finish the Tour and my top placed rider came in 97th. BUT I had earned enough money to upgrade my entire team and buy a top 15 rider that would at least get me into the top 20. After qualifying for the Tour again with my newly beefed up squad, I ended up winning the whole thing on my second attempt. With the riders that I had, that shouldn't have been possible. So I started a new game, this time on Intermediate difficulty.

Flash forward SEVEN seasons and hours upon hours of gameplay, and I'd won my first Tour on Intermediate.

I'm now starting the whole process over again on Expert and I'm actually blown away that this game is still interesting me. The graphics are hilariously bad. Every rider looks and sounds the same. Fans on the side of the road float out into the middle to cheer you on and you ride right through them. It's reallllllllly bad.

But credit where it's due. Tour de France 2015 has gotten me more involved and kept me playing longer than any other sports game. It forces you to pay attention, to learn, to strategize, and when you finally bring all that together and win your first stage of the Tour, the feeling is AMAZING.

If you like strategy and sports games, and can look past awful graphics, I'd urge you to give it a try. It's my favourite game of the year so far.

**tl;dr** -- Tour de France 2015 is unique in its ability to drive players to get better at the game without discouraging them with unbeatable difficulty settings, leading to an entertaining, super involved, and very rewarding experience.

EDIT: forgot a really important part. The true joy of this game comes down to the importance tactics play in how well you finish. Even against the very best riders on the toughest stages, if you use the right tactics and have the right luck, you can get a shot at the win, which is what real-life cycling is all about.",technology,1439585470
personalfinance,Having trouble understanding competing interest rates,"Hi everyone.  I've read the side bars and done a ton of extra research on the side for this, but I'm a little confused and looking for some clarity.  

I recently applied to refinance my private student loans (SL) through SoFi and was denied under the claim that I owe too much based on my salary.  

I currently have about $37k in SL (about half private half fed) at an average interest rate of 7%.  I currently make double the monthly minimum payment towards the highest amount and interest loan.  

My work just created a 401k plan through Paychex and I'm automatically enrolled, no matching available though. 

I am trying to take advantage of Compounding Interest.  I am 25, so I have a lot of time to see small payments now turn into something larger later.  

I understand the fact that making payments on a 7% interest rate is better than any return I'll get from the stock market.  However, if I were to start investing $100 into a 401k now, would the compounding interest down the road have been worth it, to sacrifice some of the money I could have put towards loans?

Still at an introductory rate offer of 0% for 9 months but it will go to 22.90% at end of trial.  I don't plan on ever paying anything less than the statement balance each time.  I'm using it for gas and groceries, just to keep a balance on it, usually 300 to 350 dollars which is 17.5% of the credit line, then pay full statement balance off in an effort to keep 'gaming the system to better credit' so to speak.  

I also have my car payment each month as well which I bought in January 2014 as the first step to rebuilding my credit score and have not missed a payment.  

Credit Karma recently upgraded my payment history grade to a B (HOORAY!) and my [credit score is 701](http://imgur.com/iYxYB37) but I think Credit Sesame only looks at one report, so it may be rosier than the others.

personalfinance,Higher interest vs. Higher principal debt payments.,"Hello Reddit,

I don't post much, but am a regular reader. I'll preface by saying I consider myself pretty financially savvy. I've also looked over the guides, but I didn't see anything specific to my situation. I have around 45k in student loans. About 20k of it is a private loan at 5.8%. The other 25k is made up of about 10 different federal loans at various interest rates. I'm aware of the avalanche method, which is to pay down the highest interest rate loans first, which leads me to my issue.

Does it still make sense to pay down the higher interest rate loans (I have about 5 grand at 7%) when I'm paying much more interest a month in my higher balance, but lower rate loan? I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but it makes sense to me to concentrate on the loan I'm paying the most interest on per month regardless of the rate.

Also, regardless of the answer above, does anybody have an equation where I can basically calculate a ""break-even point"" to determine the point where it is more beneficial to concentrate on one loan than the other?

Thanks!",finance,1439595250

personalfinance,Underwater Condo + ARM Loan = lots of financial stress.,"I own a condo that is severely underwater. I purchased it for $130,000 in November of 2006.

The value according to zillow is ~$60,000

I moved into a place that I pay $300/month to live in because it seemed more optimal financially about 4 years ago. I have always payed more than my required payment on the place by two or three hundred and I have made a several $10k payments   (including the payments made on the other loan). I recently started paying $1500/month because I'm just so tired of being underwater on this place. 

I want to do something about it and I've just been trying to pay it down ASAP for the last 8+ years. The complex has gone from 90% owner-occupied to (from what I can tell) almost completely tenant-occupied after more than 50% of the units were foreclosed on. I've never had a financial hardship during the time that i've owned it that would qualify me for any program like HARP and the loan was never purchased by Fannie or Freddie so it doesn't look like there is any way that I can refinance the place at a lower interest rate. 

The property causes me quite a lot of stress, but I can't seem to do anything about it. I'm hoping that you guys might have some advice. I am getting especially nervous because I have a harder time than ever imagining that the LIBOR rates will continue to remain so low. Despite how much money I could be saving on interest payments if I was able to refinance I haven't found a way that I can refinance. 

I do have ~$15k in a stock account that did really well over the last couple years, but now seems to be pretty stagnant. I was considering using that and some other cash to pay down my mortgage to 100% LTV, but after talking to several banks I wasn't getting much interest in doing a $60k loan at 100%LTV and the cost of financing appeared to be fairly ridiculous if they would even agree to it. The other thing that has stopped me on that is that I recently spent the majority of my emergency fund on fixing damages from tenants on two properties totaling about $10k(security deposit definitely didn't cover that).

As much as I would like to put my money into the stock market and max my 401k I feel like I'm just leaking money on this place with no end in sight and there is plenty of risk that the stock market will not do better than 6.54% or whatever my interest rate rises to when LIBOR increases. I have had dozens of people tell me to just walk away from the place, but I'm fairly certain that I'm not okay with that morally despite the fact that I saw several of the other owners do that even when they admitted that they could have afforded to continue paying. It seemed as though most of them got away with just a few years of bad credit scores and free accomodations for 2+ years.

Did I miss my opportunity to walk away? Is there another program out there that I'm missing? Without a financial hardship to list (other than an underwater property) nobody seems interested at all in refinancing my condo at a lower rate or even a fixed rate at 6.5%. 

**TL;DR** I feel like my underwater condo might sink further than it already is. I'm asking for advice on how to get someone to refinance or any better plan of action than I have with a good bit of plain old whining thrown in for good measure.",finance,1439598809
personalfinance,Mobile home financing interest rates (CAN),"Not sure where to ask something like this, but thought I would try here.

From my limited research, it seems banks don't finance mobile homes as mortgages in my province (Alberta). Maybe under very specific circumstances they do, but in a basic ""buying a used home on a leased mobile home lot"" they don't. I mean, you don't own the land and you can up and move the home if you wanted.

It seems odd for them to be leased as a vehicle. They aren't cheap, at least not here. ""Cheap"" would be 65,000-70,000 and expensive would be 190k and most fall in the 100k range. I'm aware from reading online that in many parts of the United States, mobile homes can be picked up as cheap as a few thousand bucks..maybe even free. I don't know why there is such a difference in price, and maybe theres even a huge difference in Canada between cities/provinces, but for where I'm looking, we'd basically want to spend 80-100k.

So we'd be going through a non-traditional lender, preferably not the park itself as I'd imagine they're almost as cutthroat as payday loan shops.

What kind of loan are we talking here? I can get approved to buy a new 25,000 dollar car on my income (debt:income levels) but I probably can't get approved to buy a 60,000 dollar car. And I have a slightly above national average paying job. So I take it people aren't taking traditional auto loans out either. 

Maybe there are special RV/mobile home loans? 

Let's say the going interest rate on traditional mortgages is 3% prime. Roughly what is a quality, but not a big 5 bank, lender going to offer as a rate for a mobile home? Like 7%? And what if someone has good credit,  but not perfect? I qualified for my car through my bank (through a dealership) but without ideal credit I pay more in interest then I'd like. That would be the case for a mobile home too.

I'm trying to ballpark a rate basically. I'm using 11% to be conservative but I don't know if it would be more or less. I don't know if a down payment is required. Here to buy a HOME you need bare minimum 5% down, which would need insurance, or 20% down without insurance. But if a mobile home is being sold through a company that isn't a national bank, and it's not a true mortgage, I take it you don't need anything down?

I imagine lots of parks do no money down sales on used homes, but make it up with inflated sticker prices and sky high interest.

Further if I go through a lender, not a park, but want to buy a used unit IN a park, what are they looking for? Debt to income, is there a common ""max age"" for mobile homes they look for, other things I should be aware of?",finance,1439599453

LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLLOW  UNLAWFUL ORDERS FROM THE COMMANDER CHIEF ______PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

President Barack Obama attends his daily intelligence meetings with the FBI director, among others. The Federal Bureau Investigation follow unlawful orders from President Barack Obama to target and assassinate activist, peace groups any innocent American Citizen that is deemed a threat to their political agenda.


Fred Hampton (August 30, 1948 – December 4, 1969) was an African-American activist,[1] chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and deputy chairman of the national BPP. He was murdered while sleeping at his apartment during a raid by a tactical unit of the Cook County, Illinois State's Attorney's Office (SAO), in conjunction with the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Hampton's murder was chronicled in the documentary film The Murder of Fred Hampton (1971) as well as an episode of the critically acclaimed documentary series Eyes on the Prize.[2]



Fred Hampton launched a project for community supervision of the police.
Through his involvement with the NAACP, Hampton hoped to achieve social change through nonviolent activism and community organizing.[3]  

After a break-in at an FBI office in Pennsylvania, the existence of COINTELPRO, an illegal counter-intelligence program, was brought to light. The purpose of this program was to target 
and neutralize ""Black Nationalist-Hate Groups"". The awareness of this program caused many to suspect that the police raid and the shooting of Fred Hampton were parts of the program's initiative. One of the documents that were released after the break-in was a floor plan of Hampton's apartment. Another document outlined a deal the FBI brokered with the deputy attorney general to conceal the FBI's role in the assassination of Hampton and the existence of COINTELPRO.[24]

The killing of an American citizen by the government without charges or trial is, as an initial matter, in flagrant violation of the Bill of Rights, US statutory law, and numerous international treaties.

From a domestic legal standpoint, every military, intelligence, and civilian official—up to and including Obama—who participates in or fails to intervene against the killing of an American citizen without charges or trial is guilty of murder. All such individuals deserve to be impeached, arrested, indicted and prosecuted.

Police wellness checks,  referred to as police welfare checks, are one way police get around the Fourth Amendment  by calling their search and seizure of a person a Police wellness check, or arguing that it was part of their community caretaking function.
Police wellness checks are often a pretext to search someone without a warrant or probable cause. There are  number of scenarios in which police welfare checks can raise legal issues regarding illegal search and seizure.
Law enforcement officers, West Warwick Police Department, among others have been engaged in pattern and practice of unlawful conduct include, among other things, kidnapping, wiretapping, hacking computers, Excessive Force,  Harassment, False imprisonment, Unlawful Stops, unlawful Searches, fabricating police reports and evidence, conspiring with physicians and health care professionals among others, unlawful surveillance, using Wellness Checks to get around the Fourth Amendment  by calling their search and seizure of a person, a Police wellness check, or arguing that it was part of their community caretaking function to search someone without a warrant or probable Cause.




LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLLOW  UNLAWFUL ORDERS FROM THE COMMANDER CHIEF ______PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

President Barack Obama attends his daily intelligence meetings with the FBI director, among others. The Federal Bureau Investigation follow unlawful orders from President Barack Obama to target and assassinate activist, peace groups any innocent American Citizen that is deemed a threat to their political agenda.


Fred Hampton (August 30, 1948 – December 4, 1969) was an African-American activist,[1] chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and deputy chairman of the national BPP. He was murdered while sleeping at his apartment during a raid by a tactical unit of the Cook County, Illinois State's Attorney's Office (SAO), in conjunction with the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Hampton's murder was chronicled in the documentary film The Murder of Fred Hampton (1971) as well as an episode of the critically acclaimed documentary series Eyes on the Prize.[2]



Fred Hampton launched a project for community supervision of the police.
Through his involvement with the NAACP, Hampton hoped to achieve social change through nonviolent activism and community organizing.[3]  

After a break-in at an FBI office in Pennsylvania, the existence of COINTELPRO, an illegal counter-intelligence program, was brought to light. The purpose of this program was to target 
and neutralize ""Black Nationalist-Hate Groups"". The awareness of this program caused many to suspect that the police raid and the shooting of Fred Hampton were parts of the program's initiative. One of the documents that were released after the break-in was a floor plan of Hampton's apartment. Another document outlined a deal the FBI brokered with the deputy attorney general to conceal the FBI's role in the assassination of Hampton and the existence of COINTELPRO.[24]

The United States Government are still currently engaged  in the assassination of innocent American Citizens . The former President George W. Bush and the current President Barack Obama, among others have violated the U.S. and International laws and have committed crimes against humanity. The former President George W. Bush and the current President Barack Obama have lied to the American people and to other countries that the United States is a Democratic and free nation. The United States Government is a terrorist country in disguise.
The American People have elected dictators. The former President George W. Bush and the current President Barack Obama have violated my rights and liberties and have issued orders to assassinate me including but not limited to unlawfully wiretapping my telephones, hacking my computers, surveillancing me; used my family as informants or anyone connected to me. 

The killing of an American citizen by the government without charges or trial is, as an initial matter, in flagrant violation of the Bill of Rights, US statutory law, and numerous international treaties.

From a domestic legal standpoint, every military, intelligence, and civilian official—up to and including Obama—who participates in or fails to intervene against the killing of an American citizen without charges or trial is guilty of murder. All such individuals deserve to be impeached, arrested, indicted and prosecuted.

In a recent book by authors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, entitled, Double Down: Game Change 2012, Obama is quoted as boasting to his aides that he is “really good at killing people.”

personalfinance,$43k in student debt - seeking advice on paying off,"Hello everyone,

&amp;nbsp;

I've read through the FAQ and understand the two methods of paying off loans. I'd just like to get some other opinions on my situation.

&amp;nbsp;

Loans: ~$43,000

Bank - $26,000 - currently paying $227/month

1. $3,100 - 2.75%
2. $5,775 - 4.25%
3. $7,065 - 4.00%
4. $10,286 - 6.50%

&amp;nbsp;

Federal - $17,300 - $166/month

Subsidized

1. $3,200 - 6.55%
2. $4,100 - 5.75%
3.    $925 - 5.75%
4. $2,500 - 5.35%
5. $2,500 - 5.35%

Unsubsidized

1. $2,000 - 6.55%
2. $1,000 - 6.55%
3. $1,000 - 6.55%

&amp;nbsp;

Current income situation:

I am working a traveling freelance gig through November, that once finished I'll have made enough to payoff all but 10k-7k of my loans.

&amp;nbsp;

I prefer the avalanche method. I want these loans gone ASAP. I currently have $15k saved up. I'm comfortable throwing $10k at my loans.

&amp;nbsp;

Questions:

Do I get rid of that 10K - 6.5% Bank loan or focus equally on that and the 6.55% Federal loans?

Should I start throwing any extra money I have at the Federal loans with those high interest rates? 

Is there anything I can do with those Federal loan high rates?

Is anyone familiar with SoFi? I received a letter in the mail from them. Their site says they can refinance federal and private loans.

How realistic is it to expect a blowout to be capped in 24 hours? What challenges are there associated with this sort of an incident? What policies do other countries employ for these sorts of situations? Does this seem like a shady deal, or pretty normal in the business?

Hopefully someone on here can help out with these questions!

I'm all for getting us off of coal, but this province just doesn't want to.

personalfinance,Should I look into refinancing my car loan?,"A little relevant information: So to start off, I'll say that I started out building credit as soon as I turned 18, or at least I tried to. I ended up maxing out a credit card for a while, built up over $800 in debt on that card and got turned into collections. It took me a while to actually get around to it, but I finally took care of it. I didn't pay it off in full, but settled. Another dumb decision on my part. So as you can imagine, my credit was pretty shitty. And it gets even better. A couple years after settling that debt, I ended up with a truck that blew up on me, and I was left to not many options because I didn't have any savings or anything, so I traded the shit truck in, and financed a new car. As you can imagine, I screwed up again and accepted financing at 13.99%. That hurts to look at now. Well I've been paying on time consistently, and plan on continue to do so. I will be two years into my loan in February. Now I haven't accrued any other debt at all. I've been on time with every single bill I have, and I've built up my credit significantly in the past two years or so. Now its getting to the point where I am interested in looking into refinancing the car loan, and I think I can get a much better interest rate now, at least, better than 13.99%. So is this a good idea? I have no idea how to approach this and how it will affect my credit. Sorry for the long post, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.

America's voters are be assaulted by government while they slumber in media subterfuge

A 1957 quarter is 90% silver and today's value of that quarter starts at $2.80

Do you you know when the Silver was removed from our coins?  1965
Do you know when the United State stopped backing currency with Gold? 1971

Do you know how much money was created out of thin air since 1971 because it became unnecessary to back it with Gold? About 2/3 of all debt since US Constitution.

Do you still believe a dollar is a dollar is a dollar?  A Dollar's value is $.03 compared to a dollar the year we instituted the Federal Reserve ( 1913 ).

Do you know that when a bank makes a loan that it creates out of thin air over 90% of the currency loaned out by a ledger entry and this is primarily how new money is created (Fractional Reserve Banking) and old money then dilutes becoming worth less (Inflation)?  The Bank makes interest profit on money it never had.  Yes, and incomes have not grown to meet the inflation.  Wonder were the middle class went now?

Do you know that Bank of America has 1.7 Trillion dollars in assets as of 2014 and 54 Trillion dollars in liabilities?  All large banks are bankrupt.

Do you know that for every Dollar in existence that approximately $.97 of it is debt owed by someone else (monetary debt system)?

Do you know what a Bank Bail in is?  It has happened in other countries recently recently (Government taking money from your bank account to pay expenses).

Do you know that the U.S. Dollar is 62% of the World's reserve currency and it faces serious competition this year?  This means other countries use the U.S. Dollar as a payment system to settle debts between themselves.  It also means when we create money to pay our debts we are exporting resultant inflation to other countries and if you are looking you will learn other countries are getting sick and tired of it (assimilating our inflation).

Do you know the difference between Money and Currency?  This one you can look up.

Just saw [this posted from the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/15/your-money/revised-program-will-reduce-student-loan-repayments.html). Apparently a new ""pay as you earn"" program is being finalized? I'm trying to figure out if this is big news, or no news, and how it would affect me.

I currently have 4 ""DL Stafford Unsubsidized"" loans totaling about $20,000. My payments come to about $350 per month for that. I can afford the payments, but of course, would like to lower them. Based on the rough outline the article provides, I may be able to lower my monthly payments to about $225.

But would that provide any benefit? I assume interest would continue to accrue, and I'd be paying off principal at a lower rate, costing me more money in the long run. Maybe I could continue my $350 payments, but direct the excess to a single loan, eliminating it faster (and thus lowering my minimum monthly payment faster). But would that provide any benefit over my current payment plan? (all the loans have the same interest rate)

personalfinance,[Credit] Quick question regarding paying off purchases,"Hello everyone, I was looking online and couldn't find this information out and figured this was a good place to ask. I also couldn't find it in the sidebar info (but I could have missed it).

When you put purchases on a card and carrying them month to month, as you pay off the card what purchases are paid off first? As in, if you have purchase A, B, C and you make a payment does it go towards purchase A or C first?

Does the interest rate of said purchases matter (ie if you had something on a 0% rate and then one on a 10% rate) in the way it's done?

I ask because I was just approved for a 0% interest (purchases and transfers) $6700 Discover It card and plan to use it to pay off some cards; there's also medical copays we want to pay but I want to ensure we get the medical bills paid off as quickly as possible so we don't accidentally accrue interest on them for no reason. So I'm trying to figure out if we pay the med payments first and then do the transfers (the current cards have a higher interest than the new card also), if that means our first payments will go towards the med bills or not.

Convoluted and not ideal, I know, but we're doing what we can until we can get a debt consolidation loan (it was declined last year, but we got a smaller loan that has helped out; credit union of course).

personalfinance,First job out of college - renting advice in large metro area.,"I'm considering several options for my housing situation. I recently started a new job in Downtown Phoenix, its my first real/after college job and so far its going really well, I've been successful right out of the gate. 
I'm posting this because I could use the advice, but I'm hoping it will also help other people in similar situations (fresh out of college, new job, housing arrangement).   

However, right now I live really far away from work (42 miles each way every day) and based on fuel costs, the 1 hour and 15 minutes it takes to and from work every day, and the depreciation/maintenance costs associated with driving that much, plus my desire for personal freedom, I'm looking to move out and get my own place.

I'm considering one of two options:

-Living alone, as close to work as possible in a reasonably priced 1 bedroom apartment to start. (no more than $800 a month + utilities)   
-Living with my old roommate from college, but we work in fairly different parts of the metro area. (no more than $600 a month + utilities)  
  
  
Main problem is he's not being very flexible in compromising how far he's willing to live from his job which would put me farther than I would like to be from mine but still save me money.  

My income is 35,000/year + commission because I'm in a sales role.
I sold insurance in college so I'm not worried about success there. Once I meet certain revenue goals my salary will bump up to 45,000 a year, and after the second goal up to 55,000 a year.
According to my boss and people on my team, most successful reps make it to at least the 45,000 level their first year, if not the 55,000.  

Right now I'm working off the 35,000 base, not considering commissions just to be safe, and that base pay is pretty standard in my current career/job level based on other offers I got before accepting this one.  

So income:  
Gross: 2916 monthly base  
After tax: ~2400

Expenses:
Car payment: $267/mo (going to refinance this on the 2 year mark because my interest rate is high at 6.7%)  
Insurance: $170/mo (includes car, motorcycle, and renters)  
Student loan payments: ~$100/month minimum  
Food/Household products: $200-300  
Gas: ~$100  

Total before housing: is about $930 including groceries and transportation costs.  
Leaves a budget of $1463 for housing and everything else.   

I'm trying to pain my student debt off as fast as possible (only $7500 total) and build up an emergency fund at the moment.   

Am I better off living with a roommate, and driving an extra 20+ minutes each way/living far from work, or saving the money and living on my own?  

Personally I'm leaning toward the roommate just to save money and have someone to socialize with but my main hang up is him wanting to live so far away from where I work, and that he won't compromise even a little bit on that.

politics,Progressive Troll's Manifesto (updated),"The candidacies and policies of real progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Congresswoman Donna F. Edwards (Maryland) and Mayor Bill de Blasio and the 72 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus could provide the best hope for permanent hybrid political structures that lay the foundations of a progressive state. My wishlist includes: Such state would, inter alia,

1. Enact Term limits for all elected and appointed politicians, including judges (2 terms). This issue divides people more than any other on the list. Should people value more integrity, fresh ideas or expertise and stability? Along with publicly funded campaigns, term limits could help clean up politics of corruption and prevent life-time office holding, such as the cases of Congressman John Dingle, Senator Robert Byrd, Senator Strom Thurmond, Sen Ted Kennedy, Sen Jesse Helms, Jr. and many others.

2. Overturn Citizens United that stripped out federal election rules limiting independent political expenditures by nonprofit organizations. It gave corporations and unions the green light to spend unlimited sums on ads and other political tools, calling for the election or defeat of individual candidates. For starters, implement the Disclose Act proposal of 2010. At a minimum, it would have enforced a mandatory disclosure of the sources of campaign spending. Progressive candidates for Democratic nomination should pledge to their voters to appoint Supreme Court justices who oppose Citizens United. “If there was one decision I would overrule, it would be Citizens United.I think the notion that we have all the democracy that money can buy strays so far from what our democracy is supposed to be.”~ Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an associate Justice of the Supreme Court.September 28, 2014.

personalfinance,I am fighting for my life -- please help,"Hi,

I am a 27 year old single male. I have ten years of experience as a software developer (freelance). I have a Bachelors degree in psychology and a year experience in the field.

To tell a short story, I fell in love at 23. We moved in together. I supported her for two years while she went to nursing school. As a freelancer, my contract was expiring in March, meaning after March I'd have no income. She was to graduate in March. The plan was for her to help support us with her nursing income. Well? You know the story. In April I found out she was having sex with my brother, and she promptly moved out and left me in a disastrous situation.

The first thing I learned? Never let somebody else control your financial destiny. The second thing I learned? I need to fix my situation immediately. 

  

As of today, **my debts**:



$22,447.03 in student debt loan (deferred for 1 year)  
$13,500 in credit card debt (90% maxed)  



My **assets**:  
$800 in my bank account for next months rent  
$6,000 in pro audio gear    
$300 income next month  



My **monthly expenses** (am I forgetting anything? I have 3 cats):  
$750 rent  
$75 utilities  
$320 credit card (100  + 80 + 70 + 35 + 35)  
$45 phone  
$40 internet  
$400 food/supplies  
Total: $1630 / month

  

Obviously, I need to start selling my audio studio, which I am committed to do. This will keep me fed, secure my apartment, and make minimal payments on my credit cards. I figure I have about 2 - 4 months of lifeblood before I am totally finished.

At this point, what should I do? Do I even have a hope? Should I just declare bankruptcy and become homeless?

I am on Medicaid. I will get on food stamps next week. I am dropping off five to ten job applications a day in software engineering. It's almost impossible to get hired for less than $50,000 a year in software, especially with my experience. I am not sure if I should drop off psychology applications. I am skeptical that I can survive off $13.50 an hour. If I get a software job and make $4166 a month, I feel like I could get out of my situation in 5 - 10 years.

I do not want to be dependent on anybody so I am not interested in being rescued. The job hunt is slow, and every day I do not get a call I absolutely panic.

Thank you all

personalfinance,"Dad seems to be unemployable, unemployment checks ending soon, parents are about to lose everything.. what do we do?","Sorry for the long post.. its going to take a bit to explain the whole situation.

I'm in my 20's, married, living with my wife on our own, etc.. doing alright.  My parents at in the 50's nearly 60's and they are not doing so well.. to put it nicely.  They haven't always made the most sound financial choices but they have also been dealt pretty crappy hands as well.

It started with a move to rural Illinois from the suburbs of Chicago back in 2003. He was telecommuting for a massive Fortune 100 corporation doing pretty high level IT consulting (old school mainframe type work) for another Fortune 500 customer. Gets offered a chance to move to a more interesting/fun/prestigious account. After thinking it over for a few days he took it.  Fast forward maybe 2 weeks or so and hes been twiddling his thumbs, the new team hasn't setup his new access, hasn't given him much work to do, etc.. then WHAM a huge corporation-wide layoff wave hits and since he is the newbie to the team he gets knocked off the wagon.  We are left in the middle of nowhere as far as employment goes with no real chance of finding similar employment.

Fast forward another 12 years.  He has been able to have a number of short term contract jobs doing odds-and-ends IT work for companies in the area.  Was involved in a startup as a contracter for a few years that never took off and eventually crashed and burned.  Somehow they scraped by financially, didn't always make the most sound financial choices along the way but they were getting by.  Very very LONG story made somewhat short.. nearly lost the house earlier this year.. refinanced with a private lender in the area at a higher interest rate so they could try to get their credit score improved in order to move to a more traditional lower-interest mortgage.  Dad had a job at the time and they were doing alright.

A few months ago he lost his job again... he didn't do anything unethical or wrong.. he just lost it.  From my understanding the company went on a hiring binge, brought on a bunch of new people, then a year or so after let a bunch go.

Now they are getting about $600 every 2 weeks from unemployment, he is pulling from his pension (taking the hit for doing it early). They have no savings, no emergency fund, but they are again just barely scraping by.

So.. the present problem. It has been INCREDIBLY hard for my dad to find work.  Back in the day he was debugging gnarly bugs in mainframes sendings details back to the manufacturer that showed he knew more about their product than they did.  He was called in for several weeks to help recover a big bank's computer system that was lost in the WTC towers. He freaking knows his stuff.. or at least used to.  But times changed and he didn't really get to keep up.. his epic skills aren't really valid anymore and he is left trying to compete with people half his age.

He has a BS in chemistry with a minor in math.. when he was in school they didn't have computer science programs.  He thought about changing careers to something else but they can't afford a degree or more education... because of their credit no bank will give them a loan for it.  He's done a little programming here and there and hes done some Windows sysadmin work, had a CCNA at one point a few years ago but from what it seems like not much beyond what would be considered entry level for his skill-level.

Unemployment ends in November, when that happens the private lender will most likely repo the house and they will lose basically everything.

Now I'm in the DC area doing programming for an internship with a federal agency making decent money and I'll be going back to school in December.  I've thought about basically dropping everything and devoting my efforts to trying to keep them afloat financially. But that would mean dropping out of school and it would absolutely crush them, they just want to see me succeed and have a good career, they have never asked for money or anything like that and I know it would be really hard for them to do so.

To be honest I'm terrified for my parents, no idea what to do.  I'm also pretty sure I've left out important details.. if you have any questions feel free to ask and I'll update the post with anything else thats needed.

Its hit my dad's self esteem hard.. really hard. He feels useless, like no one wants him.  Of course this has led to depression and its hard for them to get up and take action to learn new skills or to improve himself professionally.  They are in a knee-high rut and haven't a clue how to get out of it.

So... PF.. please.. I'm desperate here.. what can I do for my parents and/or what should they do in their situation?

TLDR: I don't blame you! Dad has antiquated IT skillset.. can't find work, about to lose the house in November.. devoting my time and money to keep parents afloat would 100% crush them.  What do I do?",finance,1439701587

Oddly prescient and spillover effects into commodity based economies. May still be a trade here given the uptick in volatility and potential effects of a rate rise into developing countries. The question is whether or not the rate rise will be priced in, or if it matters as the rise could be such a large macro driver that will recreate the below even if on a smaller scale.

This compounded with China's woes could be devastating for developing economies in the region.

""The boom in Third World bank-syndicated loans in the 1970s followed a sharp decline in interest rates on U.S. dollar securities in the spring of 1970 as the Federal Reserve adopted a more expansive policy. Banks were highly liquid and looked for attractive borrowers which they found in Third World governments and government-owned firms, mostly in Latin America. The 1960s had been a decade of accelerating internationalization for the major U.S. banks and they had rapidly increased the numbers of their foreign branches. Because of the sharp increase in commodity prices, nominal incomes and real incomes in Mexico, Brazil, and most other developing countries were increasing at above trend rates. Commodity prices declined sharply in the early 1980s in response to the surge in U.S. interest rates, and then nominal and real incomes declined in the developing countries. Should the banks have foreseen that the decline in commodity prices was inevitable?”

My dad's lease is up for my car in February, at which point I plan on getting my own car and making my own payments. I have not decided on whether I'm going to lease, or buy new/used yet. On the one hand I want to be frugal, on the other I feel like its worth it to spend a little extra money since I enjoy driving very much and commute 5 days a week. I will take on the insurance payments from there as well. My only other expenses are gas, groceries, and gym generally speaking.

My current plan is to save 11K, put 10K in a savings account as an emergency fund, keep that 1K as liquid in my debit account. Afterwards, I will begin to make larger contributions to my student loans. I currently am only paying the minimum payments but earlier I was contributing a lot more (my original plan was to pay off 1,000 month) but I thought that this might ineffective given the tax benefits you can get since these are government loans.

personalfinance,My siblings and I have a lot of FedLoans to pay back - can we separate our individual loans in the FedLoan system? Or should I just take a personal loan to subtract myself from the equation?,"This might be really confusing so I apologize in advance.

I currently have about $10,000 in FedLoans remaining (plus an additional amount of other student loans that I pay through Navient) while my siblings (two of whom just graduated a few months ago) have A LOT more in FedLoans left to pay off.  For the past two years I've simply been paying through the FedLoans website.  This was easy for me because my siblings' loans were in deferment because they were all in school, so my payments only affected my loans.  However, now they are graduated and very soon their loans are going to come due (to the combined tune of like $150,000).  It is no longer feasible for me to pay monthly because all of us have loans due; also, the FedLoan website doesn't seem to allow us to pay off individual loans (they take payments and apply them across multiple loans - really annoying).

Does anyone know if the FedLoan people allow us to separate or consolidate the individual loans that are included in my mother's account?  In other words, can I take my remaining loans (differentiated by the name of the school on the loans themselves, etc.) and move them to a different account/consolidate them so that I ONLY pay off those loans?  I don't want to be paying my brothers' loans, especially since we've already run into difficulties with my step-sister and her loan (in short, my step-father paid her loan but the money was applied across the board, effectively paying off one of my loans.  So now I have to pay her loan to call it even).

Or, should I take out a personal loan of roughly the amount I owe and just throw it into the huge pile of loans that is my mother's FedLoan account?  This way, I could subtract myself from the equation (along with my step-sister's loan, which is now mine) and my two recently-graduated brothers would only have to deal with their remaining balance.  I'm pretty confident that I could get a loan with a lower interest rate than what the FedLoan people are charging (stealing?) from me, plus it would simplify the problem as far as who owes what on which loan.  It wouldn't be like I'd have a third monthly loan payment all of a sudden; I'd still have two monthly ""student"" loan bills, one of them would just be a bank loan.  I just wouldn't have to deal with the FedLoan people any more.

But I'm trying to go to grad school (in Europe, no less) next year, and I will very likely have to take out more student loans to do so (unless I get a scholarship or something); would taking out a personal loan now to pay of my portion of our family's combined FedLoans be a mistake if I am trying to take out more loans next year?  I'm pretty sure my student loans through Navient would be deferred even if I go to school in Europe (but I really don't know), however I'd have to still worry about paying that personal loan while I'm in grad school.  And as a foreigner in Europe it won't exactly be easy to get a job and make money.

But if I don't take a personal loan, and the FedLoan people don't allow us to separate the individual loans, then my two brothers and I have to come up with a system where every month each of us pays a certain amount toward the lump sum; this effectively means that every month the FedLoan people would see three separate payments from three different people being paid toward one account.  This seems like a terrible way to deal with student loans equaling nearly $150,000.

Somehow I managed to walk away from undergrad with WAYYYY less debt than my two brothers (I never thought I'd see $35,000 and say, ""Hey, that isn't *so* bad""), and while I don't want to ""leave them behind"" to deal with the FedLoans on their own, I don't want my much smaller number to be confused with their larger ones; I don't want to have to pay their interest along with mine.

God this is so confusing.  I haven't even gone into the finer details (parents got divorced the year after I graduated while I was living abroad, step-father paid step-sister's loan which got applied to many loans including mine so now I have to assume her loans to call it even...there's so much).  I have a nice neat Navient account with my loans on the one hand, and on the other I have a veritable clusterfuck of ParentPlus loans, only a small silver of which is my debt.

Does anyone have any advice?  This is really freaking me out.  I just want to go back to school and pursue my studies, but whenever I look at these numbers I get really scared and think it might be better to get a shitty job that pays well and just pay off my loans before attempting school again.  But it's already been two years...and I'd hate myself if I didn't go back to school.  It's been my dream for years.  But I feel trapped by this debt.

Now, a couple of years in, and seeing the tax consequences, we are trying to figure out how to do it fairly.

There are two issues:

First, underwithholding.  The brokerage administering the plan withholds at a 25% federal rate and a 10.3% state rate (california).  Spouse A's actual marginal rates are 39.6% and either 11.3% (2013) or 12.3% (2014).  However, Spouse A's actual effective tax rates are of course less -- federal was 29.9% in 2013 and 30.8% in 2014, state was 10.4% in 2013 and 10.7% in 2014.

Second, capital gains.  So far they are all short term, so the issue is really whether it is fairer to use marginal or overall effective rates.  In the future there may be long term cap gains issues as well.

2. ~$440/month for the auto loan mentioned above. |

1. Currently live with my parents and I don't see that situation changing for the foreseeable future.  |
2. Don't see myself getting married anytime soon. |
3. My 17 year old car gets me from point A to point B, just fine... So unless this car breaks down and I need to cough up for major repair expenses, I don't see myself buying a new car anytime soon. |

#Questions
1. What are some ways to lower my taxable income/tax bracket? (besides getting married, having kids etc. I already plan on maxing out my 401(k) account)

2. Should I also open a Roth IRA account, in order diversify my post retirement income? If so, whats the max I could contribute to it yearly?

3. Should I pay off my student loans right away or should I just keep making the minimum required payment of ~$300/month? I'm asking because to me $900/year interest I'm paying on it doesn't seem anything crazy, but then again what the hell do I know..

4. What should I do with the $10,000 sitting in my savings account currently? Because to me the ~0.04% interest I get on it seems like a joke.

5. I'm thinking about creating an investment portfolio and I'm looking at the robo/computer based services such as Betterment/Acorn/Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, are they any good? Or should I go with the actual real-life financial adviser? (I'm afraid that if I go down that path I might get ripped off because of my lack of knowledge about portfolios/investing)

6. Any advise on what sort of portfolio should I create? Should it be bonds heavy or stocks heavy or 50/50? It would help me tremendously, if you could post a [HelloMoney] (http://hellomoney.co) link to a recommend portfolio for me!

7. What are some other viable ways for me to invest my money besides creating the portfolios?

8. Any other good resources besides PF that I could use to learn/better educate myself about investing/retirement/portfolios etc?

9. I would also love to hear any other advise or suggestions that you might have to offer and feel free to ask any questions that you might have!?

personalfinance,Should I be getting overtime?,"I started working at an office this year for an hourly wage (more than minimum but not much more). I pretty frequently work more than 40 hours a week, sometimes into the 50's. 

I never even thought that getting overtime was a thing I might be entitled to, but something sparked the thought that I might so I looked it up. I know Florida does not have its own rules for overtime so it goes by the federal FLSA act. But I'm a little confused as to whether my job is exempt or nonexempt. Some sites say that I am nonexempt since I am paid hourly, some say it's based on how much you are paid a week, some say it's based on my authority level... I'm just not sure!

In any case, my questions are:

1. Am I qualified for overtime?
2. If so, how do I prove it to my boss? without sounding like a jerk?
3. And how far back am I entitled to pay?

I have to be diplomatic when approaching my boss about things.  He's very understanding in that certain health issues I have prevent me from always being on time in the morning and I don't want to endanger that. I work really really hard at my job and I know I do a good job but I also know being late isn't exactly a plus in an employee. But I still think I deserve overtime if I qualify.

Thanks for any help you can give!

Update: The plot thickens! I asked a coworker before the boss came in today if she knew anything about him paying overtime. She said ""he never pays anyone overtime"" and ""more power to you if you bring it up with him.""  This should be fun! D: I'm not in a strong bargaining position here but it's also not an insignificant amount of money to give up on, especially with my current financial situation.",finance,1439750554
personalfinance,Advice on Renting/Buying/Saving for someone with a new job in a new area,"I am approximately 2 years out of college, mostly debt free. (My parents paid off my student debts ($23k) before they started accruing interest. Because of that help, I may owe them $5000 in early 2019 to help with my siblings student debts if necessary--they will be trying not to ask for that money if possible.) 

I moved to a new area for a new job. At this point, I have been in the new area for 9 months. The new area is more expensive than where I was from. I can see myself staying with this job in this area for an extended period of time.

I was hired on at ~65k/year. I recently got a raise to ~70k/year but I am intending to immediately start putting the raise money into my 401k because I am currently only contributing 3% (planning to up contribution to 7%, company contributes 3%).

I have been renting rooms in people's houses for approximately $600/month (utilities included). I have been wanting to use my moving package to move out my belongings and feel settled, but I can't bring out my furniture to this house which is already furnished. I have been torn between continuing to rent where I am (losing my moving package) and trying to buy. 

A house in a decent area is between $330k and $360k (3 bed/2.5 bath, 1400-1700sqft). These same houses rent for ~1900/mo, so I'm not interested in renting them, though if I owned, I would rent out 1 room. (I will acknowledge that part of the draw of buying a house is emotionally related. Where I am renting is the 13th place I've lived since the beginning of 2013, and there is a part of me that really wants to be permanently settled.)

I have $30k that's currently sitting in my bank account doing nothing.

I own a used car. There are no debts associated with it.

I am inclined at this point to keep where I am and bring out non-furniture items to store in the garage of the place I am renting, even though there would be benefits to buying now (housing market is rising in the area, interest rates are rising, tax benefits, emotional benefits etc). I just wanted to confirm that this would be the best route with my current finances.

From that point, I wanted to get opinions on where I put the money that's currently in my bank account and how long I should be saving/how much I should save to before investing in a property.

I would appreciate any constructive input. Thank you for reading.",finance,1439750619
personalfinance,"Still in college, already in massive debts, trying to fix some of it now?","Alright, so I'm in my senior year of college, and will be graduating with an English degree. I plan to immediately test into English teaching and get a job doing that. I know I could live on a teachers salary (even though its one of the lowest paying salaries there is) because I'm so used to living poor. Anyway, not even addressing the student loan debt currently (in the state I live in, the federal government helps pay off a portion of my student loans if I teach) here is a breakdown of my bills vs what I make.

Am I just budgeting wrong or what? I feel like I do a decent job but I'm still drowning. I'm using my school refund money to finish paying off my tickets and a loan I owe on, and I plan to up the payments on my credit cards to hopefully pay them off sooner. My job is far-ish away and I'm borrowing peoples cars and hitching rides because I lost my car and laptop due to a shitty relationship, but I'm trying to take my car back (my parents are holding it and making the payments so I didn't have a repossessed car on my record). My car payment is $300 a month with insurance at $180. Right now that's not even a possibility. I don't want to quit my job, however, as I make $9.60 pre-grad and they pay for my college classes if I make straight A's. I think I really just need help budgeting.

personalfinance,advice on getting rid of my overpriced car,"In a series of terrible financial decisions, I took two brand new cars out of the dealership, traded them in, and then bought a used one. 

In the loan for the used car I had to include the negative equity of the 2 previous cars which depreciated the second I drove away so the loan for an 18k car was for 26k. The monthly payments are killing me but with such a bad ratio of value/debt refinancing and lowering the interest rate is out of the question(I've tried). 

I've thought about selling the car but I'll probably only get 14k for it leaving me with almost 10k still to pay. Would it be smart to take out a personal loan (probably at a ridiculous interest rate) to pay that difference? The monthly payments would surely be lower which is really what I'm after.

personalfinance,Do I really owe my parents on this investment?,"I'm a 29M, and I live in New York.  I invested in commercial buildings for $27,992 of my personal income a little over a year ago with many others including my parents who invested precisely the same amount.  My parents are the greediest people you'll ever meet in your life.  They think about money 24/7.  We didn't want to let the person know who was running the show that I was investing because they felt I shouldn't tie up my money and I may complain that I want it back for purchasing a home eventually etc. This was never the case, I wanted it tied up, I knew it was long-term, but I wasn't going to be able to convince him otherwise.  We ended up putting the investment entirely under my parents name to hide my involvement.  

The total principal amount was $55,984, and so we shared equally in the quarterly rent checks we received 50-50 over the course of 5 quarters.  Everything split right down the middle.  The person who is in control that set the whole deal up ended up being able to sell the buildings and yielded a total of $27,000 profit on the total principal, or approximately a 48% return.  To avoid long-term capital gains taxes now, it was decided that we would roll the money into a new investment already lined up and being worked out, and my parents would buy my portion of the investment out because I'm getting ready to purchase my first home and will need plenty of money moving forward.  I feel if they want to take over and benefit from the quarterly profits and the appreciation of the principal in the next investment the total amount is being rolled into, they need to give me my total principal ($27,992) plus my half of the total profit ($13,500).  My parents feel that I need to pay the long-term capital gains taxes on my half of the profit claiming that they will pay taxes on this half eventually when the next investment sells.  I agree that they will pay taxes on this money later (of course), but I'm telling them that it's now their money and their responsibility.  From the time that this new investment deal is made, they are the ones benefiting from the appreciation of the new principal (our totals and profits together, $82,984) and when the quarterly checks roll in and/or the new investment sells, they will receive all of the profits.  I'm completely not involved.  I won't see a dime of that.  

My argument to them is this is hypothetically like starting a business in our garage together with an initial investment of $55,984, and the company has now gained value and is now worth $82,984.  Then my parents decide ""hey, we want to take this company in a new direction, so we'd like to buy your 50% ownership out"" and they would then proceed to buy my half of the full amount the company is worth or $41,982.  My parents so far have given me my principal back plus HALF of my half of the profit ($6,750) and are withholding the other half of the profit from me claiming that they will pay 50% taxes on that profit.  I've looked online and know that as of right now, Federal plus NY state long-term capital gains taxes are around 30%.  I will need to pay my half of the long-term capital gains taxes on the quarterly rental checks we received and I'm not disputing that.  I am disputing with them that I don't owe these taxes on the profit from the sale of these buildings because I feel they're buying me out of my membership in the new investment and should pay me the full amount that my 50% portion is worth ($41,982).  Out of the $82,984 total money now between us that exists now, $41,982 is there because of ME.  I feel like they're handing me a $5 bill for a $10 bill and screwing me royally.  If they only give me half of my profit, they have $6,750 of real money appreciating in this new deal that MY principal appreciated into originally and are benefiting off of my hard earned money.  

At this point they took 75% of the total profit for themselves and I'm left with 25%.  I know my parents are incredibly greedy, but didn't expect them to steal from me which is what I feel they're doing.  Reddit, am I wrong about this? What are your thoughts?",finance,1439770230
personalfinance,Should I close my new credit cards that are under a year old if don't need them/use them?,"Hi! So I didn't have a job last year and ended up having to open some new credit cards to do balance transfers so that I could keep my interest down and still have money to spend. ( I know, bad idea.) I had opened 3 additional credit cards that I now don't need and they have a zero balance. So now today, I have 8 credit cards open, when I'm only using my Discover card. I'm wondering if I should close two of my newest cards because they have relatively low credit limits, relatively (in comparison to my other credit cards) high interest rates, and they are 10 and 15 months old. My total utilization right now is 4% and closing these wouldn't make a difference.

My main reason for wanting to close these two accounts is to help raise my average age of accounts, they lowered it pretty significantly since I opened my other cards years before this. Would it be worth it/smart to close these two accounts or should I just let them be? I don't plan on using them even once in a while just to keep them open.

personalfinance,[Auto Loan] Shorter term making higher minimum payments VERSUS Longer term and paying extra with smaller minimum payment.,"What are the risks of going with the second option?  I like the benefit of not having to stretch my budget, in case of other financial emergency or a string of bad months (I make commission).  


As I see it, there are two drawbacks:

- (1) On a $20,000 loan, a longer term could add several hundred $ to a couple thousand total costs in interest (over the life of the loan). 

- (2)  If I sell the vehicle before the loan is paid off, I'll have less equity in it if I've got a longer term.  So that's less cash from a sale, or more importantly a bigger risk that I'll have to pay off the difference in the future out of pocket. 

What else am I not considering?  I feel like both of these drawbacks are offset, as long as I'm diligent about paying extra each month.  I don't think they offset the peace-of-mind from a lower *minimum* payment.  I understand the consequences of going with this option, and then only doing minimum payments.  

I've been press proved for $20,000 by CHASE (because you get a .25% discount using autopay with your other accounts through them).  Interest rate for 48 months was 2.6%.  This is for a used car loan. I may re-apply for 60 months, however.",finance,1439773753

investing,Are BDC's dying?,"I have had about $10,000 (about 10% of my portfolio) in TCAP for about a year now. The dividend is nice (11%) so I've held on to it as the price has dipped. I'm down about 18% on the stock for the year but 11% sort of helps mitigate that so I'm down more like 7%. It usually ranges and you just reap the dividend, but it's plunged quite a bit in the past couple weeks. 

I'm smart enough to know that I'm not as smart as I'd like to think I am and I'm wondering if the imminent rate hike has anything to do with how BDC's (business development companies) make money.

- Anticipated income tax for this year: $9,175
- Allowances to claim: 0
- Additional withholding per paycheck: $433

Based on the following information that I provided to the calculator:

- Single
- 1 job

- not blind
- no nonwage income

Tax credit for energy-efficient residential upgrades--friend doesn't own a home. Write off of loss from the sale of stock--friend traded none of his holdings.

I've told my friend that signing and submitting these documents makes them a party to tax fraud. Do you have any suggestions as to what they can do? Should they just take their documentation to another accountant? Report this one to the IRS? What about the money already paid to this accountant?",finance,1439824600

Long story short, I went to a ridiculously expensive film school that I dropped out of before I turned 20... Never paid a penny on any of my loan throughout my 20s as I just didn't see how, other than my $10,000 federal loan that I'm paying back due to garnishment.  I'm making just $13 an hour full-time and just started to put away about $100 per week in savings.  I'm not sure how much this bit of savings will help but I feel I need to ""grow up"" now that I'm 30 (yes, this deserves an eye-roll).  I haven't been able to get any credit cards or even an apartment or car lease without a co-signer.  I don't want to live my life this way.  I know bankruptcy is not an option with student loans.  I just want to get my credit back up and be able to have a clean slate.  Yes, I know I owe the money to my creditors for going to film school a decade ago.  I feel like my only option is to win the lottery to pay it back and have my clean slate.  If you were in this position, what would you do?

***UPDATE***  After posting this, I checked my credit report (haven't in several months) and the private loans are now saying ""Charge Off/Closed Account"" which I'm guessing means I no longer owe?  I need to talk to someone for legal advice on this.  If this is the case, and it's been a decade, how do I get these to ""fall off"" my credit report?  And by them ""falling off"" does that mean they no longer hurt my credit?  Thank you all for your advice thus far!",finance,1439827375

I would appreciated some insight on what is an affordable price for a vehicle. I'm not looking to buy anything now, I have a fully working vehicle right now, but I'm trying to plan for the future and want to get a ballpark on what a reasonable purchase would be.

Some info about my current finance situation:

* I have a $7,000 line of credit I'm in the process of paying off (I used to have some really bad credit card debt and transferred it all to the line of credit since the interest rate was have that of the CC)
* I have no CC debt
* Own a condo. My payments are $1,400 including the condo fees and property taxes
* When I purchased my condo it was for $268K, all upgrades included. The same unit (with no upgrades) is now selling for $308K
* I have approximately  $190K left on the mortgage
* My monthly income is $4,000 after taxes
* I currently own a car with approximately $3,800 left on the loan, the monthly payments are $200
* My current car is worth approximately $8,000
*  Total monthly expenses amounts to aprox $3,000

Here's where I could use some help. My SO and I are not engaged at the moment, but it is definitely something that could happen in  the near future. If it does, I would want to plan for a wedding as well. We would do a destination wedding to keep costs down and are looking to spend max $6K to 8K on the wedding. 

My house right now is big enough for us at the present, but if in the future we end up having children we would be a little tight on space. I'm sure we would be fine for the first year or two, but as the kid grows we would want to expand into a bigger home. The average purchase price on a home in my city is $400K.

If we do end up getting a bigger house my SO's income would be added in as well, but that's not something I would want to until after marriage.

As I mentioned I don't need a new car right now, but I'm looking to put myself in the right financial situation so that when I'm ready to buy I've managed my expectations on what I can afford.
When I am ready to upgrade I would want to get more of a family vehicle (since we plan on having children). I currently have a 2DR tiny little car, not the best for carting kids around in so I'm hoping to upgrade to an SUV.

I'm particularly looking at either a Nissan Rogue or Nissan Juke. I'm not set on used or new, but if I bought used I would want something less than 5 years old.

So! I'm really hoping for some input from you guys. I know it might be hard since I might not actually purchase this car for another year or two and income and expenses may change in that time, but what do you guys think?

personalfinance,"26, English Degree, made some mistakes early on, trying to see if there are other private student loan re-financing options.","Hey guys! I dug up my old reddit account in order to post. I always lurk on this subreddit and have found the advice invaluable. I thought maybe I could get some thoughts from you. 

I'm 26, English Degree from a top 20 University, and fully bilingual. In order for me to have moved out of the terrible State I was living in, I took out a huge private loan at 32k at 7.44% interest. I know this wasn't the best but, without it, I wouldn't have afforded the housing, food, and my one-way ticket to leaving my terrible State and getting a better education than I would have had I stayed. There were a lot of other smaller loans, tuitions, mixed with scholarships, two jobs, credit cards, etc totaling 220k that don't matter anymore and are fully payed, so I'll spare you. This one big loan and a tiny loan are all that's left.

Currently, this loan is at 42k + another 3k loan that is in deferment making the total 45k. 

The loan provider is AES and they will not defer longer than the 6 months I already deferred. I cannot change the interest. I am not allowed grievance deferment. Their system of payment does not allow paying with credit card and once you pay, they take their sweet time to apply the payment to the account. I've got good credit, so I was wondering if there was any way I could move this loan to someone else with a lower interest rate and better management system? SoFi has denied my application because, even though my credit score is decent (750), they will not refinance due to my degree. Wells Fargo does not have a better interest rate than the one I have now. 

Cutting more corners to save and pay it off faster than I am is not possible (I put in it like 1,000 a month to the loan when I can to pay it fast):

- Right now I pay $450 for my half of rent split between the GF. We live in what most people would consider a closet, but it's pretty cheap and there's no room for more stuff, so I don't buy stuff.
- 3 credit cards with limits of about 10k (I ask every 6 months to raise the limit a little and they always say yes) each fully payed off and not in use except for things like a soda once in a while to keep them active.
- no car (I walk to work) 
- salary is 50k a year before taxes in a boring job that has nothing to do with my degree 
- I don't have cable and I steal internet from the neighbors. 
- Electricity, water, gas heat is included. 
- I pack lunches most of the time or eat cheap at subway. We have a grocery outlet next to our house. 

Is there anything I can do to pay this loan off sooner? Any refinancing options for services I haven't thought of? I have 5k in an IRA from my previous employer; should I take that out and take the tax deduction hit to pay off the smaller 3k loan with no interest? I just want to be done with this as soon as possible, start my life, maybe start a 401k, and not lose a chunk of my paycheck to this loan anymore.

Then transfer the remaining balance to this chase slate card and have $5k interest free.  I plan to do this more than once as each $1k will let me keep ~$0.17 per day.

When I was born, a couple of family members gave me savings bonds ($50, $75, $200 respectively for a total value of $325) set to mature in 18 years. Thus, all of them have matured and even accumulated a little extra interest. I plan to cash them now, as I wasn't aware of them before, and will probably use them either for paying off loans a little or textbooks, whichever seems best. However, my mother is hounding me to wait longer (possibly to the 30 year mark) so that the bonds gain more value. This seems to me...well, a mistake.

The interest rates of these bonds are 1.27%, and even though I'm not an econ major I know that inflation rapidly makes that an utterly paltry amount. In my mind, it makes more sense to cash them now to ensure the dollars I get back don't lose any more purchasing power than they already have, but she remains unswayed. Crunching the numbers, cumulative interest since '95 is over 55%, so the $200 bond's made about $40, all things considered.

In the end, it's my money and I have full power as to whether or not I cash them now or later, but I wanted to know if my assessment of the situation was correct, or if I need to unstick my head from my ass. Thanks very much for the help, I really do appreciate it.",finance,1439834186

* ill be able to collect three paychecks before im out of my friends house.  this adds up to $600, minimum.

* my degree will be an associates in electrical engineering technology
* after i finish college i will have $15k in student loans (all unsub direct stafford loans)

Currently, we rent a one-bedroom condo in a major metro area for VERY cheap, and have saved a lot as a result. We have a young child whose (cheap-for-the-area) daycare is more expensive than our rent+utilities each month.

We are running out of space though, and are considering upgrading to a 2+ bedroom.  Our parents are eager for us to buy something in this market.  It's my thinking that we should go by what the rent vs. buy calculators say, as well as specific market conditions.

We are looking at a specific neighborhood of older townhomes. The area in which we are looking is very well-located, but has actually been declining in value fairly steeply over the past 2 years, and Zillow predicts this will continue into next year.  

After doing rental research, I think we could rent the property we want for approximately $600 less per month than the cost if we buy.  That, coupled with the declining value, has me thinking we should rent rather than buy in this neighborhood.  We would likely only stay for ~5 years before upgrading anyway.

Are our parents like most baby boomers who gained a lot as a result of the real estate bubble? I believe they probably gained more wealth from real estate than any other form of investing.  It seems to me that if we want to live in our target neighborhood, renting is the better option.

I read this sub almost everyday but would appreciate some feedback regarding my specific situation. 

Vehicle loan - $330/month, owe $17,200, 2.99% rate, 72 month term, currently worth approx. 16k (I do not intend selling the car anytime soon. My husband and I have this one vehicle that I commute 70 miles to work in). 

Student loan #1- subsidized government loan through Navient. Owe $5,000 in deferment until January 2016. 3.86% interest rate. 

Student loan #2 - also through Navient. Unsubsidized (now accruing interest) $7,700 same starting payment date and interest rate. 

We have a 6 month emergency fund set up and I have a company match 401k that I contribute to bit neither of us have IRA's set up and I feel that's important to start throwing money into asap. 

We have $2,000 a month left over after all bills and budgeted discretionary spending that I could use to pay off these loans early but I'm wondering if it's even worth doing? I was thinking I should pay of the unsubsidized loan as fast as possible and leave the other two to regularly monthly payments.

personalfinance,Should I finish my master's degree and take out a loan?,"I have been fortunate enough to not have to take out a student loan so far. I graduated from college in 2013 with a B.S. in Psychology. I always knew I would have to go to grad school. I decided to pursue my M.Ed in Higher Education Administration from the state university I graduated from. I had to take some teaching classes for that degree and decided that I wanted to become a teacher. Half way through that degree I switched to an MAT in Early Childhood Education program at a private school. I am half way through the program but will have to take out a federal loan (~$20,000) to finish the program. I do not want to stay in the state I am in, so I would have to get certified in New York state which will add more money and delay my ability to get a job after I graduate. 

My problem is that I love being a teacher (right now I work as a pre-school teacher/part-time and I make $12/hour). I know being a pre-school teacher is much different than being a public school teacher and I am wondering if it is worth acquiring so much debt when I won't even be certified to teach in the state I want to move to (meaning I would have to take more tests/classes to get certified before I could become employable-further delaying my career). 

I only have about $1,200 in savings and I want to move out of my parents house and begin my life. Would it be stupid to finish my original graduate degree (M.Ed higher ed administration- can be completed online) which costs me $2,000/semester or would I be making a stupid financial decision to complete my MAT degree in Early Childhood Education when I want to move to New York state and my program is making me eligible for certification in Georgia.

Sorry if this post is rambling, sometimes I need an outside perspective because I feel that I always make the wrong choice.

TL;DR: Is it stupid to complete an expensive MAT in Early Childhood Ed degree ($20,000 federal unsubsidized loans plus additional cost/time of certification in New York state) or should I finish my original M.Ed Higher Education Degree ($4,000- online program from accredited state university that I graduated from). I want to be a teacher but I feel like it is not financially responsible to continue as it would cost me more time and money and I could only work part-time while completing my degree. I feel like I have wasted so much time on education as it is and I just want to get into a career where I could be self sufficient. I have been lucky enough that my parents let me live at home rent free, but I want to be financially independent at this point in my life.",finance,1439847487

personalfinance,Can college loan guarantor/debt collector garnish MY wages on my wife's student debt (she got before we were married)?,"I've been paying like clockwork, where my monthly payment was getting split into payments between a private and federal loan. Somewhere along the way, I got two months behind, then the loans were sold to separate guarantors. I made payment arrangements on the larger private loan ($15k) to bring it current, I had forgotton that there were two loans, and now the smaller, federal loan ($4.5k) has sent my wife to collections and threatening to garnish wages. My question is, she had this debt long before we were married (in fact, it's under her maiden name, which they refuse to change to her legal name) - can they garnish MY wages? (She is unemployed)

There's a lot more to the story obviously, but right now this is the critical information I am trying to ascertain. I am trying my best to be fiscally responsible. I didn't even know this had gotten so bad until the collector started calling. Again, I made arrangements with the larger loan, but we absolutely can not afford TWO loan payments.

personalfinance,Seeking Advice re: Employee Stock Purchase Plan,"Hey PF. long time lurker, first time poster. I apologize if this isn't the appropriate sub for a stock-related question. If that's the case maybe you can point me in the right direction.

As you may have guessed from the title, i was offered enrollment in my companies employee stock purchase plan. I'm in my mid 20's, Bachelors in Business,  and this is pretty much my first corporate gig. 
I take home only about 2k a month after taxes. This plan allows me to purchase company stock at a 15% discount. The purchase price for the six-month purchase period will be a 15% discount on the lower of a) The price of the offering date of Sept. 18, 2015 or b) the price on the applicable purchase date (this is one of the things confusing me). I choose how much to invest, from 1% - 15% of my GROSS eligible compensation. My contributions are deducted from my after-tax pay. At the end of the purchase period, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will deposit shares of stock into my account. I'm currently putting 6% of my gross income into my 401k.

A brief break-down of my financial situation as it exists today: I try to be very frugal, and concentrate on saving/debt reduction. 

*Living with parents rent-free while I save some money and pay down some debts. I plan on getting an apartment w/ my gf in 9 months or so.

*2000 in savings. I've been putting most of my income towards credit card debt that I will have completely paid off by the end of this month. (Paid off 9k in 9 months thanks in part to advice found here. Thanks!)

*Car and insurance comes out to about 320/mo.

*I have about 15k in student loans. I'd like to get serious about paying this off soon, but i've been concentrating on the credit card because of the much higher interest rate.
 
*$300 to 400/mo in misc. expenses like food, entertainment, etc. 

I'm not going to post the companies stock info here at this point, but its a medical tech company, and info i've read suggests that its a solid investment. I've seen ""buy"" ratings on the few financial sites that I checked. i'll be happy to tell you the company name and stock symbol in a PM or even post it in an edit if that doesn't violate any sub rules.

At this point i'm leaning towards investing 5% of my gross income into this plan. I'll have the option to re-enroll at a different rate or withdraw entirely every 6 months. Any advice you guys have is greatly appreciated. You haven't steered me wrong so far.",finance,1439851134

I'm not concerned about the 28k or 14k, we'll have most of it forgiven through public service reimbursement and the rates are low (kinda).

In an effort to reduce interest owed/monthly payment on the 75k, I've been reading about home equity loans.  I bought a home a few years ago and have about 75k in equity with a reasonable interest rate.  I'm lost here, could I take out a home equity loan at a lower rate to shift the big loan to a lower rate?

investing,Starting a New Business in Canada,"Whether a business is established in another country or starting from the ground up in Canada, there are a few things that every business should do first. These steps will make sure that the business has the best chance of success and that the business is geared toward Canadian markets.
 
Research the Markets
The first thing that must be done before any new business enters the market is to do the research. The more information that is known about the industry sector, the economy and the demographics, the easier it is to tailor the business plan for the best chances of success. The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses offers plenty of research into business trends, what is affecting new and small businesses and what sectors are growing. This not only helps with understanding the competition but finding which market in Canada is the best to enter at what time.  Small business optimism is on a slow decline in Canada at the moment but the majority of small businesses are expecting next year to be better than this year. This makes it a great time to start looking into Canada as a new opportunity for business.
 
Registering Your Business
When you decide to have your business Incorporate In Canada, there are a number of steps that must be taken to ensure that the business complies with all the laws and standards of Canada. This includes filing the correct permits at every level of government and filing the necessary paperwork to register your business. Business registration is necessary for tax purposes, payroll, GST/HST, and import/export but for many businesses, registration can be completed entirely online. It is important to go through the process in it’s entirely to make sure that everything is done correctly and that your business is eligible for online registration.
In terms of filing for permits and licenses there are a number of steps that must be taken. There are federal permits and licenses that need to be filed as well as permits and licenses for each province. If your business will have an office within Canada, it is important that it complies with the requirements of the province that the office will be located.
 
Hiring Canadian Employees
Even if you are expanding an ecommerce business that exists in another country, you may want to have a local office within Canada. The process and requirements for hiring employees in Canada is process that every business must be familiar with if they want to comply with the laws and regulations of the country. Payroll deductions are a necessary part of having employees in Canada and must be conducted in partnership with the Canada Revenue Agency. For new businesses that are unfamiliar with this process, it can be very beneficial to hire an experienced Canadian business advisor to jump start the process. This will be costly initially, but it will ensure that all the legalities are covered and that all new employees are in compliance with the country’s regulations.",finance,1439860141

They want to take out a loan, an equity loan on our primary house and another property, to pay off the remaining mortgage on our primary house, the remaining balance on our 2 cars, my brother and my student loans, and any outstanding credit balance on all of our credit cards. They feel that the interest on the equity loan will be less than the combined interest on everything else and that the payment will be more manageable, especially with both me and my brother starting work soon.

* Primary house market value: $260,000
* Primary house remaining mortgage: $103,00 (what we want to pay off)
* Second property market value (property is completely paid off ): $160,000

I am in need of your help. ( I apologize in advance if this is the wrong subreddit. I saw another user ask about 401k so I thought I would do the same here.)

I recently moved jobs and I'm having trouble deciding whether I should roll over my 401k to my new employer's plan. My old employer offered Fidelity with Vanguard retirement funds so I chose this option. (100% of 401K contributions went to Vanguard Retirement 2050 fund) I'm 28 and have around $30,000 in this fund's 401k plan and also another 30,000 in roth IRA at Vanguard in the same retirement fund.

My new employer offers Charles Schwab and I'm not sure if I should roll over my old 401k plan to this one or whether I should keep it in Fidelity until retirement. What do you guys advise on this? Also for my 401k at Charles Schwab, which fund should I contribute to? I looked at the SM450 - Schwab Mngd Ret Trust 2050 Cl IV but the expense ratio seems higher than the vanguard one I have. I can allocate a % of my contribution to the below funds. I'd appreciate any advice you can give me. Thank you!

personalfinance,"Would you mind helping me figure out a way to escape my debt? (Living recklessly, paycheck-to-paycheck)","Hello,

I am attempting to reduce my debt and generally minimize my financial burden. While I am capable of paying my bills at the moment, I believe I am recklessly living on the extreme edge of my monthly salary and have made multiple negative financial decisions. I'm looking for input on the most practical way to escape this debt ASAP from those who may have been in this position before.

I am a single father of an elementary-school aged child so working part-time is not possible at this time. My goal is to sell everything possible and rid myself of this debt (start fresh) but I don't have a lump of money sitting around so I believe I'll have to do it strategically. Also, the assets I have are worth considerably less than the debts so I cannot just sell them off to a private party where liens are involved (automobiles and the mortgage).

Here is a listing of my current debts and expenses. Essentially, a budget (I'm working on improving my budget and have just started using YNAB as well). The debts are slightly rounded up for simplicity's sake.

&amp;nbsp;

**Take-Home Income: $4,200/month Salary**

**Debts:**

Name | Monthly Minimum | Balance | Interest Rate | Notes
-------|----------------------|----------|--------|-----------------
Car Loan | $420 | $30,000 | 3.59% | Worth ~$19k
Motorcycle Loan | $340 | $18,500 | 4.59% | Worth ~$12k
Mortgage | $1,100 | $93,000 | 4.25% | Worth ~$100k w/ *lots* of love
Credit Card | $100 | $4,500 | 8.25%
Personal Loan | $360 | $15,500 | 10.99% | Used to Consolidate C.C.'s and make fix major house livable
Student Loans | $400 | $52,000+ | 4.5% - 6.8% | Recently switched repayment plan to reduce monthly cost
Medical Debt | $25 | $800 | 0% | Was able to negotiate this price. They're not happy.
**Total** | **$2800** | **$215,000**

&amp;nbsp;

**Roughly estimated historical expenses:**
(Embarrassing -- working on fixing it)

Name | Monthly Cost | Note(s)
-------|----------------|--------------------------
Groceries | $200
Fast-Food / Restaurants | $400+ | Yeah, I need to work on this.
Fuel/Gas for Cars | $100
Child Care | $150/week | Only used during school-breaks
Utilities | $300 | Varies depending on the season
Clothes | $100 | Average. I buy clothes, shoes, school backpack, etc... for my son twice a year (summer, winter)
Gym Membership | $120 | While understandably over-priced, this has recently begun saving my physical + mental health. It's a Martial Arts gym. I can work while my son trains. I have access to unlimited sessions/month as well as their exercise equipment. This one is probably an unnecessary evil so I don't fall apart. (It was very difficult taking the first step in even starting to repair my health)
Misc. Child Expenses | $20 | Rough average. Includes things like school supplies, school lunches, school fees, random things that makes my son's life at school a little bit better. I'm not low-income so no handouts.
Recreation | $100 | Average. Probably less realistically speaking.
Gifts/Birthday/Christmas | $100 | Shooting to reduce this, this year.
Cell Phone | $60
Internet | $60 | Required for work
Pet Supplies | $60 | We have 1 dog. She was a rescue. We love her and I don't think we're going to give her up.
Medical | $20 | Varies. Sometimes more, sometimes less.
E-Cigarette Supplies | $40 | I will catch flack for this one. Switched from cigarettes. Working my way down and away from the habit/addiction.
Auto Insurance | $150
**Total** | **$2,000** | *Rounded*

&amp;nbsp;

**Things I should be putting money aside for but don't:**

* Emergency Fund (6-months)
* Auto Repairs / Maintenance
* Finishing my house so I can sell it
* Extra money towards debts (especially the credit card)
* Eventually, a retirement fund
* Eventually, maybe a fund to help my son with college if he decides to go
* Vacation (My son *really* wants to go see Lego Land someday. I want to transition from collecting ""stuff"" to collecting memories)
* Probably other things I don't even realize.

&amp;nbsp;

**Account Balances**

* Checking: Almost empty (less than $100)
* Savings: Nil
* 401k: A few thousand (no longer contributing while I tackle debt)

&amp;nbsp;

I know that the tone of this may not sound desperate; however, I have been trying to figure out a way to escape this debt for months now. I have totally screwed myself with the negative equity on those vehicles (or buying them, in general). I got screwed on the house by my contractor and it would cost more to sue than I would actually get back. I am willing to sell everything I possibly can. I have another pickup truck worth probably less than $3k with well over 220,000 miles on it that I'll be happy to drive if I am free of the car + motorcycle. I don't have any money put back. I am not expecting any lump sums of money. I also don't know if my job will be stable beyond 2016. Realistically, I could be screwed at any moment if I lose my job or get sick. I am desperate for a way out of this but because of the amount of stress over time I've dealt with over this situation, I need to take things one day at a time and try to make baby-steps to be practical/realistic about sticking to a budget.

Any (serious) help or suggestions are extremely welcome. My strategy right now is to sell the house after August of next year (2 years since I purchased it, for tax reasons), hopefully walk away with a bit more money than I owe, put that towards snow-balling the rest of my debts until I'm left with just school loans. It's the only plan I can come up with that makes sense to me.

Thank you so much in advanced to those who have some constructive ideas to share :) I am well aware that eating fast-food, owning a motorcycle, and using nicotine are horrible financial decisions so please don't be too hard on me. This is already difficult enough and I'm not completely oblivious to how much I've screwed up my life financially. I'm learning the hard way and one day plan on paying for everything with ""cash"" (no more debt). I'm open to all practical options.

ethereum,Mining Saturation Point / Buy or Mine,"Proof of Work phase supposedly ends after 1 year and switches to Proof of Stake. Mmmmm. Steak.

R290x generates 25 MH/s and costs $350 and uses about $2 of electricity per day.

It's total cost over the course of it's productive life, therefore, is $1080 in costs over a 365 day period.

It contributes about 0.01% of the total Network Strength of 250 GH/s. It mines about 1 block every 1.5 days, or 3.33 Eth per day. That comes to 1215 Eth per year.

Therefore, the equilibrium point for new entry of miners will be: 

 * Theoretical Hashrate Saturation Point 
 * = (1215/1080) * Price of Eth * 250 GH/s 
 * = 281 * Price of Eth

However, the productive life of the mining rigs will shrink at the exact rate that the Proof of Stake draws near. This will discourage both new entrants from mining and old miners from replacing their equipment as it burns out. The network hashrate will drop as we approach POS day.

Additionally, we can expect no miner to actually mine (AKA expose himself to noise/heat/electromagnetic pollution) when he or she is making no profit. When we factor in an arbitrary say... 20% risk premium, 5% inflation premium, and 3% interest rate premium, then our estimated network saturation point is...

 * Profitable Hashrate Point 
 * = (1 - 0.20 -0.05 - 0.03) * (1215/1080) * Price of Eth * 250 GH/s 
 * = 202 * Price of Eth

And there is my estimate for the benchmark for whether it is cheaper to mine or buy. If Network is more than 200GH/s * the Price of Eth, you should buy. If Network is less than 200GH/s * the Price of Eth, you should mine.

Edit: You should adjust that number based on your ability to withstand noise/heat/electromagnetic radiation.",cryptocurrency,1439878091

personalfinance,Good idea to use 0% APR credit card checks to pay off student loan debt?,"I have tons of student loan debt (over 300k) from professional grad school.  Repaying is turning out to be a very slow process as I grow my business.  Luckily, I have great credit which allows me to carry cash back cards like the Citi 2% card.  I have two cards like this and both of them were 0% APR for 15 months when I first signed up.  Both of those periods are long gone and I pay my credit card off every month.  I have no other debt besides my student loans, most of which is federal with ~30k left in private loans.

Last week Chase sent me a stack of 3 checks that can be used for any purpose but draw against my credit limit on this card.  The credit doesn't have to be paid off for 15 months with 0% APR on the amount for that timeframe.  Any other purchases have a regular interest rate, however I normally don't use this card, so that wouldn't be a problem.  The fee for this service is 2% of the amount charged through the check.

I am considering using one of these checks to pay off one small private loan that has ~$4k left, interest rate 4.5%.  This amount would be well within what I can pay off within 15 months and I would be saving approximately 2.5% interest on the loan, about $100 (actually it's less because interest is lower as the loan is paid off)

Is this idea worth it?

**Edit**

Here are some calculations:

$4000 @ 4.5% = $180 to pay in interest over 1 year

$4000 @ 2% = $80 one time credit charge

This is a savings of $100 if paid within 12 months.",finance,1439882695

financialindependence,How the government benefits from traditional retirement accounts,"I know there are some people who believe that in the future, higher tax rates will punish people who saved through traditional retirement accounts. This is a tangible concern, but I don't think it's very likely to wipe out the enormous benefits of using a retirement account. That's because the government is really a lot better off if they preserve 401(k) and traditional IRAs.

It's much more likely that Roth retirement accounts will disappear in the future. However, that won't affect _existing_ accounts. Instead the government will ultimately remove the option to make Roth contributions. They may even sweeten the deal for traditional retirement accounts, possibly by implementing further tax incentives to push employers to enroll more people in these accounts, or by making 401(k)s opt-out rather than opt-in.

Let's compare Alice, Bob, and Charles, who plan for their retirement in three different ways. Each of them earns 10K they don't need to spend immediately. Alice invests her 10K in a traditional retirement account. Bob pays 2.5K in federal taxes, then invests his remaining 7.5K in a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Charles also pays 2.5K in federal taxes, but puts his 7.5K in a conventional taxable brokerage account.

After ten years of 7.18% returns, all investments have exactly doubled. Alice now has 20K, while Bob and Charles each have 15K. When Alice takes her withdrawals from her traditional retirement account, she pays 5K in federal income taxes and nets 15K for herself. Bob withdraws his 15K tax-free due to his Roth account. Charles pays 1.125K in capital gains tax, and nets 13.875K for himself.

The total taxes paid are 5K for Alice, 2.5K for Bob, and 3.625K for Charles. The total benefits netted are 15K for Alice, 15K for Bob, and 13.875K for Charles.

Notice that from the retirees' perspectives, Alice and Bob are the winners while Charles is the loser for ending up with less money in his pocket. From the government's perspective, Alice is the clear favorite for paying the most taxes, and Bob is the enemy for paying the least taxes.

What's consistent here is that whether you're playing as the federal government _or_ as the retiree, Alice wins the game. She pays more taxes _and_ collects more retirement money. That's because traditional retirement accounts, coupled with the progressive nature of the marginal federal tax brackets, are really a way for the government to own a portion of the stock market without directly controlling it. Instead of seizing capital, as under old-school socialism, the US government has decided to allow _us_ to manage the capital ourselves, but then scrape a piece of the reward at the end.

Capital earns better returns on the open market than it does in the government's hands. That means Alice is helping the government by contributing to her retirement account even after accounting for the time delay in the collection of taxes. It's not likely that Bob's 2.5K in taxes ten years earlier helped the government more than Alice's 5K ten years later, because a lot of government spending is on services and subsidies, not on liquid capital earning 7.18% per year.

I think in the long term, as the portion of the population that's currently retired continues to grow, you'll see changes like 100% of SSI payments being treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. There might even be a small garnishment from the top of large 401(k)s, such as a 3% addition to the top marginal tax rate for 401(k)s paying more than 50K per year. However, it's extremely unlikely that the government will ever impose punitive measures on traditional retirement accounts that would render them unusable. The government needs these tax-deferred accounts to keep more capital liquid in the market long-term.",finance,1439903829

personalfinance,Could you please help me understand the ABLE Act / 529A savings plan?,"Hello everyone, I was hoping some of you would be knowledgeable about the new savings plan the US federal government has created under the ABLE Act, which should start accepting sign-ups this year.  I am not entirely sure that my state (PA) has signed on yet, but I would be surprised if state congresspeople did not.

From what research I have been able to do (such as [National Law Review](http://www.natlawreview.com/article/able-act-allows-millions-individuals-disabilities-to-save-achieving-better-life-expe) and [Nerd Wallet](http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/whats-529a-account/) ) list that the only requirement is proof of disability before the age of 26.  That's no problem, got plenty of that. But I feel that it can't be that simple. Is there any way to be sure there is not a financial requirement?

The main purpose of the act is allowing disabled people to setup savings plans that do not impact their SSI/SSD benefits.  I am currently working but I know my working years are limited and I will be very surprised if I am still working in 10 years (I am currently 26). I am trying to prepare for this as much as possible because obtaining SSD is a very long and expensive process.  For my conditions, I would have to be out of work for at least two years before applying and be over the age of 35 for any chance of approval; and of course, not have a 401k or an IRA or a savings account, etc.  So I don't feel I have a good shot (especially since invisible disabilities are much more difficult to 'win' than visible ones, regardless of medical proof and years of treatment).  So I cannot count on it in the slightest.

Is pursuing this a good plan (if I can even open one since I am currently working) or would I be better off putting that money into my 401k and IRA - which can be cashed out without penalty upon disability?  Would it be more likely that the 401k and IRA have a lower standard of disability - translating into not having to hire a lawyer (as opposed to SSD) and saving money in the long run?

During my research I have also come across a Special Needs / Supplemental Needs Trust.  I currently have very little assets (a car basically), but my parents do plan to put their house in my name within a few years.  Perhaps it would be better to create a trust for that as to not make my chances of getting any aid even slimmer?

Or do I just need to get off reddit and actually talk to a financial planner while I still have resources to do so?

I am aware that I have a very pessimistic view of SSD but I have seen too many people get screwed over by it.  Government is what government does.

Edit: I also want to point out that I am a lurker of /r/FinancialIndependence as well and am expanding my investments due to the eye opening that sub reddit has caused me. Unfortunately, expensive medical bills preclude a lot of my savings (even with good insurance, but that is a rant for another time and place).",finance,1439906810

But let us remember that r/bitcoin was far from perfect, and there are other ways in which r/btc can improve on the original and become a more respectable environment. Here is a list of suggestions, which comes with my application as moderator:

* Discussing the most relevant developments in the world of altcoins (e.g. Ethereum's launch) should be allowed.
* Threads which are non-bitcoin specific and of exclusive interest to fringes in bitcoin's community (e.g. ""banks are evil"", ""end the FED"", ""Ross Ulbricht did nothing wrong"", ""Julian Assange bought a latte with bitcoin"") should be heavily de-emphasized or not allowed.
* Image macros, memes and low-effort submissions (ten-word text submissions) should not be allowed.
* Heavily critical, even existentially critical viewpoints (i.e. Buttcoin without the insults) should have representation as long as they are of some quality and down-voting them ipso facto should be discouraged.
* While I abhor what has become of the term ""safe space"", everyone interested in bitcoin regardless of the reasons for his interest or his political philosophy should feel at home in the subreddit. ""Statist"" should not be a insult, and when Paul Krugman writes about bitcoin there should not be 10 threads on the main page making fun of him, calling him a ""so-called economist"" or posting pictures of him drinking champagne while talking about fax machines.
* Moderators should publish a charter in which limits to their authority are made clear from the start. This should include a list of conditions to allow the community to have a say in the management of the subreddit, as well as a pledge to step down should they generate Theymos/Pao-levels of disapproval or outrage in users.

A number of subreddits have had a history of slowly descending into low-quality, semi-censored, low-effort circlejerks until the point when a sizable part of the community decides to find refuge in a newer, smaller, better subreddit – usually thanks to the dishonesty of moderators and after a catalysing event takes place (r/technology and r/atheism come to mind). r/bitcoin has developed a terrible reputation in social media as a feeding ground for paranoids, conspiracy theorists and get-rich-quick hopefuls, and to Buttcoin it is an endless source of (often justified) comedy gold.

personalfinance,(UK) Can somebody explain variable ISAs to me?,"How is the rate determined? Its time to renew my ISA and I'm old enough now (21) that I really should be making my own decisions on who to invest with. I have never accessed the money I have saved but I'd like the option to be there. I've found a 1.51% variable isa with virgin money, but I want to know how that rate is determined. Whats to stop them from dropping the rate in a few months? I'm assuming its a base rate or something accross the UK with each provider adding their own bonus % on top, but I'm clueless as to how it actually works. I believe that there is an expectation of interest rates to rise which is why I'm looking at variable ISAs opposed to fixed, but I have no idea which option is best for me until I understand the variable rate!

personalfinance,"Friend is Starting a Business, Hiring Me On As Manager - What do I need to do regarding an employment contract?","Hello!

Short Story: I'll be the operations manager for a new climbing gym in Washington State, north of Seattle. There are three owners, and then me, the only employee (as of now). Only one of the owners will be working. He'll be GM. We haven't worked out an employment contract, it's a barebones operation. I don't know what to ask for, and don't know how to ask for it. 

Back Story: my best friend paid for my ticket to move from Iowa to Wa and Climbing Wall Assoc. certificate. He's been letting me live for free in his living room, and drink for free at the bar he owns. I was under the impression that everything was a go and the gym would be starting the second week  of July, that loan was denied (I found out a week after the fact). Then the second loan was supposed ""to be approved"" by Aug 10, it was denied too (I found out yesterday). 

Now they've decided to forgo the SBA for 150k, use start up cash of 80/90k to purchase the lease of the building, buy holds, ropes, gear, utilities, etc, and then ask for a smaller loan after 6-9 months. 

I was obviously frustrated, as I quit my job and sublet my apartment to come out to a non-existent job. But things have been okay, I went into poor mode, and have just been climbing outside or staying in and reading (which I don't mind hehe). 

But now things look like it could be for real, and I don't know what to do. 

How much should I get paid? Hourly or Salary? Should I get benefits? Should I ensure a severance package? 

I've already made the mistake once of blindly trusting my friend, but he's a business man through and through, meaning I need to act like one too when it comes to business. 

Other info: I have 66k in student debt, all federal, I'm on IBR, and pay $0/month starting July '15, because I made ~9k last year. I'll make even less this year, even with the job starting in October. I have resumes out to dream jobs, all of which could likely pay higher, but with less freedom and responsibility. I would feel terrible if I took one of those jobs over the gym, but I've got to protect myself. I have now, basically, $0. I've applied to Starbucks and the grocery store, etc and am trying to pick up a few shifts as a server at a restaurant. I have two BA in the humanities, with excellent references, and an award from an academic conference on Mid East studies. I plan to go back to school in a year or two, likely in Europe because I'm a dual citizen.

personalfinance,paying loans in whole or monthly,"When I started college back in 2013 I received a $3500 subsidized federal loan to pay both of my semesters. Then in 2014 I received a scholarship that would allow me to pay off the rest of my time in college. I also have been working and can pay off the loan from freshman year. 

My question is should I pay off this loan now? I would have a decent amount of money left over if I were to pay it off.

personalfinance,Should I Refinance?,"I have 5 private student loans totaling 53k with anywhere from 8.1 to 8.3 interest rates. The minimum monthly payment is $684 and I believe they are 10 year loans that I began paying in November, after a May 2014 graduation. Between my parents and I, we pay $2000 a month to these loans, so well above the minimum. 

At this rate, we should be done in less than three years. I've begun to look at student loan refinancing and was rejected by SoFi and Earnest. I was approved by Citizens Bank for the below: 


10 Years	Fixed	@ 7.24%	or	$625.04	a month for a total cost of $75,004.20
or 

5 Years	Fixed	@ 7.19% or	
$1,059.34 a month for a total cost of	$63,560.33

The 5 year fixed looks pretty appealing, because it's a 1 percent drop, with the opportunity for .25 percent extra if we enroll in automatic payments. 

But, since we're paying them at such an accelerated rate to begin with, would it be worth it to refinance? I just turned 23 and live at home. I plan to stay at home for another year at least, but more likely two. I'm worried if something were to happen and my parents aren't able to contribute the $1000 a month they currently are, I would be stuck with the 1k+ a month payment if I were to refinance for 5 years.",finance,1439920667
personalfinance,"I want to quit my job and do a programing bootcamp, how should I finance it?","Hi PF,
I've been going over this in my head over and over again. I feel it's the best move for me. Here's the thing, I'm 30 with a BS in Business Admin and have paid my student loans down to $35K (Fed loans currently on income based repayment). I am currently a truck driver because I wasn't able to land a job out of college in 2013. I don't enjoy truck driving, its been something that I took to be able to provide myself with housing and a way to pay back my student loans. Currently my payment on IBR is $10 a month for my student loans because my income has been so low since graduating. I haven't been able to make more than $20,000 a year since graduating. 

I am thinking about quitting my job, taking a loan out to relocate to a city on the west coast to attend a programing bootcamp. The loan would have to cover the tuition, my housing/food/gas while attending. The tuition at the programming boot camp I am looking at attending is about $22,000. I don't know how much housing would cost, but I am looking at renting a room in the area and rooms are going for about $700-800 a month + shared utilities. The programing bootcamp is about 6 months long. They have a 98% placement rate for their graduates. I do have a Class A CDL to fall back on if I can't find a job after the bootcamp.

I don't know how I should finance this. I can't pay cash for it and I can't save up for it, I have to take out loans. I have almost a 800 credit score from being good at paying my bills, paying off cars, etc. Should I try to get a loan with a local bank? Get a personal loan? The problem with this is that I have to quit my job to do the school. There are no programing bootcamps in my local area. I also don't know how long it would take to get an income after graduating the boot camp (finding a job). This is something that I really want to do, but the financing part of it, I am unsure of. The school isn't accredited. What advice do you have for me, about financing a bootcamp? 

Info:

 *  I have almost an 800 credit score with a long history, but a low income (Currently)
 * I have a Class A CDL to fall back for a job (currently working as a truck driver) but I have to quit to attend the boot camp
 * Tuition is about $22,000 and I have to move to a state on the West Coast with a high cost of living to attend
 * The school isn't accredited and its 6 months long, they have a 98% placement rate with an average salary of $98,000 a year
 * Its for a full-stack web developer
 * I would also need to financing my housing, food, gas/car payment ($200 car payment, I can't sell it) to attend. 
 * I have a BS in Business Administration with a $35K gov student loan thats about $10 a month right now on IBR.  
 * I have to quit my job to attend, I don't know how that will effect the loan.

Especially a year or so down the road when PoS starts to be implemented, giving less and less reason for miners to actually mine on PoW.

I guess I'm mostly curious as to how ethereum will avoid the fate of nearly every other PoS cryptocurrency, yes, there have been many, NXT and BitShares to name a few.

I am looking for some advice regarding student loans.

I am about to start my last year of graduate school (MS in Speech Language Pathology). I borrowed the max amount of federal student loan money for this year. I thought I would be okay financially, but there are a lot of unexpected costs arising (licensing costs, examination costs, graduation costs, continuing education conference costs, moving/relocation expenses when my lease ends in May). 

As of right now between my student loan money and my part time job (~20 hours a week of working) I have my tuition, rent, bills, and textbook costs covered for the year. I don't have any additional resources to cover anything else. I've cut down as much as possible out of my budget and I am living as frugally as I can.

I figure a small private loan should get me through the rest of the expenses I will encounter for the rest of the year. I was thinking about Sallie Mae (there are fixed and variable interest rate options for graduate student loans), but I am wondering if anyone has any other ideas that I haven't come up with. Are there better private student loan companies to go through? My own personal credit union that I bank through does not offer student loans.

First of all - I'm not looking for relationship advice, this is something that I've thought a lot about and am prepared to take on the risks.

My girlfriend graduated from college recently and has just started at Medical School. She's about to start her 2nd year, so she has at least 3 more years to complete.

She currently has multiple loans from Stafford in deferment, 2 from her undergrad, and 2 from her current enrollment in Med school. I'm wondering if I can and should start paying down her loans so that her interest isn't building up while she's at school, and that we could reduce her(our) financial burden when she finishes school.

Would love to hear financial advice on if this is possible, and if so, what's the best way to start tackling this/does it make sense? 

Thanks!

EDIT: Adding some additional context to see if that helps shape things
1) Completely realize the risk financially of being in a relationship and not being married, this is also a financial decision (ring, wedding, financial aid) - that aside, looking for financial advice assuming us as a couple

2) My financial situation right now is fairly comfortable - able to put in significant amounts to retirement each paycheck, invest, while having a solid safety net and easily making monthly payments on rent/phone/etc. I have no debt

3) Her current interest rates are around 7-8%

4) She is currently interested in fields that generally don't make as much money

About 5 years ago, we started a small company, and we've been making really decent money.  We have a pretty big dealer contract base, and it seems like we'll continue to do well.

My question - for the last 2 years, our Financial Advisor has helped us with Term Life insurance (250k for each of us), and IRA's for the purpose of tax relief for our company.

Lately, he has been really pushing us to do a Whole Life Insurance policy for the sake of Investing in our later years.

Here's the issue - I still have a ""poor"" mentality.  I like having money in the bank (I know this is not a good idea from an investment standpoint), but I never know if/when I might need it.  My wife &amp; I are very frugal, but I also don't want to work forever.

I have pulled my credit report bi-annually for the last 4 years. It has always had the same thing - my student debt and this super old healthcare bill I can't even pay cause they resold the debt like 10 times. The healthcare bill will be dropped from the credit report in a year, so I'll let it go. I tried a few years back to pay that off, it's only like 40$, but it's impossible hence I'm just letting it fall off. 


For the student debt, it reflects the loans I have paid off and the ones I still have. It goes back to ~2007/2008. I actually pulled my credit report ~2 weeks ago, so I am sure of the debt I have. I moved outta state for school, got married, and changed my last name. The credit report reflects all of this.

We are getting married next summer, are paying for at least half of the wedding ourselves and would like to have a house ready to move into by the time we get married as well.  Was hoping you guys could provide some advice and critiques for us:

**Current Monthly Incomes (post tax)**

My Amex Card - $4000 (0% APR until December 15, 2015)  
Her Amex Card - $3100 (0% APR until June 3, 2016)

Her Student Loans - $24K (private) + $5500/year (Federal); don't need to pay while still in school  

We have a little over $10,000 in our money market account at the local credit union.  Wedding is going to cost our own pockets a little over $13K (not payable until beginning of next summer), and we need to start saving for a down payment for a house.  After expenses, we've been dumping all of the money left over into the money market, paying towards credit card bills (since 0% interest) with the intent of paying them off before they begin incurring interest.  These balances are remaining from previous vacations and bigger purchases over the past couple of years.  These credit cards will be paid off/transferred to another card once 0% APR expires.  I have plenty experience transferring balances with no fees and avoiding interest.  The balances WILL be paid interest free.  Just trying to get the most money as quick as possible.  What can we do?  Are we doing things right?

Housing has 2 options: 1. Find land and build a house or 2. Look at getting a cheaper fixer-upper on 2-5 acres.  We'd like to build/buy a 1300-1600 sq ft house, 3 bed, 2.5/3 bath; our budget for this house is about $180K.  Part of what I'm looking to do is build a detached (or separate entrance) garage with a studio or 2 bed apartment to rent out to local college kids or friends to greatly offset the mortgage.  I live in a relatively low cost of living area (compared to what I see on here); I am 15 miles south of the closest city.  Bestplaces.net gives my area a rating of 87 for housing CoL if the national average is 100.

I've been thinking about contributing to an IRA/Roth IRA.  I am planning to go back to school within the next 3 years to pursue my PhD, so I was told to look into a traditional IRA which I may be able to backdoor into a Roth if I go back to school.  Is this something I should look into now, or should I just keep dumping money into the money market?

Thanks for any comments (positive &amp; negative).  I appreciate the time you took to read and reply to this!  Hoping this develops into a conversation between posters and myself.

edit: formatting, addressed credit card debt.

edit: while I appreciate each and every one of you who have taken the time to read/respond, I would appreciate a little more **constructive** criticism.

investing,Question on Traditional Investing vs. IRA vs. Whole Life Insurance,"Hello Everyone - here is my situation. My wife &amp; I have been very poor for a long time. About 5 years ago, we started a small company, and we've been making really decent money. We have a pretty big dealer contract base, and it seems like we'll continue to do well.

My question - for the last 2 years, our Financial Advisor has helped us with Term Life insurance (250k for each of us), and IRA's for the purpose of tax relief for our company.
Lately, he has been really pushing us to do a Whole Life Insurance policy for the sake of Investing in our later years.

Here's the issue - I still have a ""poor"" mentality. I like having money in the bank (I know this is not a good idea from an investment standpoint), but I never know if/when I might need it. My wife &amp; I are very frugal, but I also don't want to work forever.

My financial situation: I'm 37, my wife is 48. The only loan we have is our house (140k), and we've been putting 5k a month on the house payment, hoping to pay it off in 2.5 years. We have 150k in the bank, and 40k in IRA's.

My question to you - I would like to invest 50k. Should I stick with a traditional investment, or go with the Whole Life? He really seems to ""upsell"" the Whole Life as some type of ""loop-whole"" idea. Or, should I stick to a more tangible investment like a rental property? I'm not looking to get rich, but I would like a better interest rate than the bank for my money.
Thanks!",finance,1439935464

personalfinance,Looking for /r/personalfinance to give me a sanity check. Am I doing this right?,"My goal is to spend less, use new founded money wisely, and take appropriate (or inappropriate) risks based on my age and situation. I want to build wealth quickly to make up for lost time. I want your feedback on my ideas but more importantly your advice. 
 
I'm single no kids, 32 years old, have a house and make about $95K with salary and bonus. I claim either 1 or 0 and get about a combined $7-9K back in taxes each year from State and Federal. This amount is mainly due to the amount of interest I pay on my mortgage. I'm also getting a raise in the next couple of months of about $8K. Here is a screenshot of my [Mint Page](http://imgur.com/zUvQgKm) and [Credit Score](http://i.imgur.com/xLCiOEs.png)
  
My current budget isn’t that great but I know where I can fix it. I usually accumulate (aka live above my means) about 6-7K a year and put it on credit cards. Sometimes that’s on 0 interest cards, sometimes not. All my spending is on credit cards so the rewards definitely (in form of account credit) outweigh any interest I pay. When I get tax return or bonus, I usually just wipe out CC debt and start over. 
With that said, here’s my plan. Please critique it, suggest other ideas, etc 
 
* Adjust my budget to spend $500.00 less a month, resulting in not carrying a CC balance
* Change my dependents to 4 or 5. My accountant said this will pretty much make my tax refund null at the end of the year, but the difference will be in my paycheck. Let’s say this yields about $330+ a paycheck (twice a month)
* With my $8K raise, my additional bi monthly income will be around $250 (rough math)
 
 
This will give me roughly 900-1000 extra month to invest. I will automatically put ~475 into my sharebuilder account each paycheck and purchase the following
 
* 50% on the mutual fund TWNOX
* 20% on the ETF GLD
* 30% on Tech stocks such as Apple, Netflix, Google
 
 
The Mutual fund has no cost to purchase after a small initial fee. The other stock and ETF will. I will have to figure out if it’s cost effective to purchase less frequently. The net result of this is that I won’t be waiting for a bonus or refund to pay CC debt, be in control of my money, and hopefully choose wisely and make my money earn interest rather than paying interest and/or having the government hold it for 12 months.

personalfinance,Pay off credit cards first or save for down payment on income-producing property?,"I wish I had done this sooner, but, I just recently decided to get smart about my finances. I have succeeded in making major lifestyle changes to cut my expenses, and am creating a monthly budget that will allow me to make progress towards improving my financial life. 

I have about 11K in credit card debt across three accounts. The interest rates are 9%, 15%, and 22%, with the 22% card being nearly half of the total. Obviously that is my first priority in paying down. 

I also have a goal of moving into a 3 or 4 unit property where I can live while paying the mortgage with rental income. I have talked to a number of real estate agents, property investors and mortgage lenders already and have a solid plan on how to do this - I just don't have the money to put down. 

ReadyForZero shows me that I could pay off that debt in 2 years by paying $520 a month or in 1 year by paying $964 a month. If, let's say, I could budget $1000 every month to go towards either debt service or saving up for that down payment, what would I be best advised to do?

I expect to need about $15,000-$20,000 to get into an income-producing property, using a FHA loan with 3.5% down, meaning it will likely take me around a year and half to two years to save up for. 

If I pay off my credit cards in a year and then start saving, it could be three years before I am able to buy a property; if I save for that now, it could be sooner, but I'll still have credit card debt.

My gut is telling me that I would be better off getting out of this terrible credit card debt as soon as I can. It will make it easier to save up later and easier to get good financing.

personalfinance,Question about managing student loans &amp; rent vs. mortgage,"I am a law school graduate but I didn't pass the bar, so I'm currently working through a temp agency at $11/hr for a government department (37.5 hours/week max, no overtime). My wife will start a medical assistant job in about 4 weeks at $11.50/hr (40+ hrs/week, overtime allowed, and she can also work weekends). We are currently living in a rent-free, mortgage-free home she inherited (only $150/month for utilities), but both our jobs are over an hour away so we'll be spending at least $60/week each on gas. 

Due to family issues, my wife and I moved out of my parents' house this past April into the inherited home so that we wouldn't literally die of stress and anger. In the past 3 months, while we were both looking for jobs, we've run through our entire savings and despite being VERY frugal, our bank balance is exactly $0 as of today. Last week was my first week of work, so my first paycheck is coming in this Friday. I'm not worried about that; we have nothing we need to buy between now and the end of the week, and my wife can pawn off her wedding dress for about $1000 in the near future.

(Note: I've spoken to my wife about cutting back. Her problem is that she pays for things without considering how much it'll be until it's all over. The other day, she spent $110 at the grocery store for two weeks' or so of groceries, but the way she phrased it that morning sounded like she was going to pick up only a handful of things at under $50 total. I've discussed it with her, and we've decided to use the envelope system so that she can't possibly overpay if she's limited to cash and not a debit card.)

I have about $60K in federal student loans that I've been paying off for the past year and a half on a 10-year plan (~$800/month); one loan is about $15K and the other about $45K. Because of the financial drain of the move, which again was absolutely necessary, I called the loan company and got the rate reduced to $350 per month. I can't change it one way or the other until this November--rate changes are only allowed every 6 months. 

Here's the predicament. If I keep paying just $350 per month, it'll take much longer (as far as I know) for the loan to be fully paid off, but we can't afford to go back to $800 per month. My wife and I are each going to be commuting about 2.5 hours per day until/unless we move to the city where our jobs are located, which would greatly reduce the amount we pay for gas but also burden us with $700 to $800 per month in rent. We can't both afford an apartment and pay off the loan in 10 years, and there's no guarantee that either of us is going to be getting significantly more than what we're getting paid now within that time frame.

A close friend of my wife who lives in the city where our jobs are located mentioned that he and his wife mortgaged a nice pre-owned house for pretty cheap (~$550 per month), which seems pretty nice considering you get to own the house in the end AND pay less per month. We're considering that as an option, but no matter what, we'll need to get an apartment first so we can scope out potential houses. Also, we WILL need to move out at some point; although we can stay here for the foreseeable future, due to a variety of circumstances (not least the financial and psychological drain of the huge commute x2), we can't stay forever.

Can anyone offer some advice on how best to manage the loan situation and whether it'd be better to rent or mortgage? I keep insisting to my wife that we pay off the loan and become debt-free as soon as possible, but she insists that we simply can't afford to do that right now--and there's no guarantee that we can in the foreseeable future either. I know I can't have my cake and eat it too, but we have to manage our expenses and debts somehow, and I want to live a debt-free life ASAP and start saving so maybe we can afford to have kids.",finance,1439940219

The next 'due' payment I have is in November 2016.  I understand that they are doing this so that they can continue to collect interest on this debt based on the minimum payment due.

**Background Info**

Using my throwaway account because I don't want my roommates (whom I met on Reddit) and other random friends to know my personal finances.

So I'm a little late in asking this, as I received my inheritance almost two years ago now. A couple months before my final semester in undergrad I received around $250,000.

At the time I had no loans since I had managed to cover school through scholarships and frugality, had never purchased a car, and had no credit or bills whatsoever, besides rent and utilities.

After keeping some money aside for a car, traveling, and a year off between undergrad and graduate school, I invested $230,000 through a family friend (my older brother's childhood friend) who works at MetLife Investments.

Even though I find investing very interesting, and used to have a stock simulator in undergrad - I decided it would be unwise to pay too much attention and ""play"" with the money - so I have let my financial adviser make all of the decisions and handle it completely.

The money came in chunks, and I deposited it between October 2013 and March 2014.  My adviser has completely diversified it, has purchased me a term (that's turning into whole) life insurance policy, and I suppose all the other things you would generally expect.

I am starting graduate school at the end of the month (in DC, so also a very high cost of living), and he advised me not to touch the money in my investments, but pay through a combinations of my leftover savings, working through school, and unsubsidized loans.

With a part time job and all predicted costs, I should be able to manage with taking out $41,000 over two years, or $10,250 per semester.  For the first year, the unsubsidized graduate loan interest rate is 5.84%.  I will have to start paying them back six months after graduation, at which point hopefully I have a good job lined up.  I must also pay any interest accrued at the time to prevent it from being capitalized when repayment begins.

Going by the total $230,000 being invested by March 2014, my current portfolio is at $232,500, or an increase of $2,500 over about a year and a half.

**The Actual Questions**

Is this an amount I should be expecting, considering what I pay to MetLife Investments and MetLife life insurance, and normal fees for starting up a diversified investment portfolio, for someone at the age of 23?

Will it begin to perform better now that things are settling in, or should I get on my advisor about being more aggressive with the investments?  He's a family friend so I completely trust that he has my best interests in mind, especially considering he came into his inheritance through a very similar situation.  He's also young, so I just want to get other's opinions.

The other question being regarding the loans.  Does this seem like a smart plan?  With my current growth rate, I worry I'll be losing more to loan interest than my investments will be growing.  However, it also will keep me from spending unwisely, since I'll have loan payments to focus on first.

**TL;DR:** Invested $230,000 a year and a half ago through MetLife, it has only grown $2,500, is that normal? Advisor recommends taking out loans for graduate school instead of paying for it upfront, is this wise?",finance,1439944725

She had petitioned to have the last semester removed from her record, but it has not been accepted yet.

Her credit rating is just below 600. We recently tried to get an equity loan on her car (worth about $3600), but was denied on the low number. Leaving the idea of an unsecured loan with little to no chance.

personalfinance,24YO that could really use some financial help! (Credit/Budgeting/Saving/Planning),"Hey everyone, so I have run into some problems with my life and I am now in my “start of the career worrying problems”. I find myself always worrying about money ever since I graduated college and left home and moved across the state a year ago. 

A little background first (I will make things as simplistic as possible). Currently a 24yo Male. Good job with a little over a year in. Four year BA in Criminal Justice. Lived in New York all my life. Moved to Arizona day after graduation for job. No family or real “friends” out here other than co-workers. 

Left college with 28K in student loans (federal). After college I found out my mother opened up a credit card in her name and my name to “build me credit” and never told me. Ended up being 3k in debt on a 5k limit (Chase Freedom). I had my own credit card from an electronic purchase when I started college and didn’t use it wisely after that. I still have about 2k on that with a 3k limit (Barclaycard US). Left college with about 5k in savings and 2k in checking. It was just enough to start a life in Arizona with rent, start up utilities and deposits. When I left college I had a credit score (Credit Karma) of 700. My monthly rent is $600. Utilities (Cable, Water, Electric, Gas, Internet) is about ~$300. I purchased a vehicle (new, I know – big mistake) in September of 2014 for 24k. Because I was not in a job for a full year, my father needed to cosign with me. My interest is 3.75%. I pay $330 a month ($30 is due to a stupid fee incase the cosigner – my father – dies then the loan is forgiven). 

Now we are in present time. My credit score has went far down to 660 (but a recent fico report read 620?) and some credit cards have went up. Chase – 4k/5k. Barclaycard - 2.5K/3K. Vehicle Loan – 20K. And a new Amazon card $800/3.5K. My current money situation is around 4k in savings, 1k in checking, and some cash stored away. I make about $1,600 every two weeks (some pay periods about 2k). Now, I tried going from my small town Credit Union to a new Credit Union – PenFed. They have great rates that can beat what I have now if I refinance my vehicle through them. So I started the process. Opened up a checking account and savings account. But it told me I have been declined any credit through them (I could be wrong but if anyone wants to help me more please help – just got the info today – I am very new at this stuff). So now I am kind of in a rough spot. I want to trade in my vehicle because I am young, and what young stud does not want a muscle car. I took my vehicle to the dealership and can only get 15k out of it. Also, I noticed on my credit report something that was sent to collections from a hospital visit (went to them last week and they said they never had correct info from me and would take 30 days to get rid of it from the report and they are “sorry”). 

So that is about it, I worry about money every day and I know I shouldn’t do that. It causes a lot of stress. Its hard for me to make this change because my parents always try to give me money but I never took anything from them nor will I – It just does not feel right to me. I like to go out a lot and have been cutting back on that stuff, but I am still adjusting. 

What is the best way for me to: 
1. Get these credit cards down 
2. Get my credit score up 
3. Trade my vehicle (I know it may not be smart but this is a goal) 
4. Be financially stable (I do not think I am right now)

If people actually care to help me (which would be awesome!) then I can go into more detail if needed. I will also answer any questions you may have to help me get my life together! Thanks all!",finance,1439969468

personalfinance,"In another country with defaulted student loans in US, been unable to pay and want to start paying soon.. How much trouble am I in now if I visit the US?","Here is my (bad) story.. I went to a private university 2006-2008 with a 40k tuition. Got a few grants and scholarships but ended up borrowing about 50K in private and federal student loans. I dropped out of college (like an ass) because I got depressed and then moved to another country (feeling quite ashamed). I am a dual citizen of US and said country. The loans are all in default now. 

Did everything on my own but always made just enough money to get by and live well here without anything that fancy. I'm in my late twenties now. I rent a home and have a job/ small business now. I might be seeing a significant pay increase which means I will likely will be able to A) save up and pay big chunks towards the loans or B) contact them for a loan rehabilitation program and make monthly payments.

The loans must have accrued thousands in interest between 2008 and now (like 20-30K or more) I can imagine. My business is starting to pick up and it would be fantastic to be able to pay the maybe 70-80K debt off in one or more big chunks.. and if that's not possible to just start making monthly payments.

I'm absolutely not proud of my actions, inability to pay and fear of what will happen if I return to the US. The last time I had any contact with the offices was while ago and I got a deferment for some of them because I showed them I didn't make enough to afford to pay. 

So my questions are:

1. Once I start making a significant amount above my monthly costs, should I save to pay the loans off in full? or should I contact them and make monthly payments asap? How do I best continue? Im only making about 20-30K now but expect to make 40K by next year and 60K after 2 years.

2. Will they try and seize my income in another country because of the default status?

3. What happens if I return to the US to visit family? Will I be stopped and held somewhere until I pay, is something like that possible? If so, until when should I avoid going to the US?

Thanks in advance if you read this!

EDIT: some spelling and formatting

EDIT 2: Thanks so much for all the replies and useful information everyone! Seems like the best the to do is make sure my taxes are in order and if plan to go back as a resident to make arrangement to pay off the loans when I have a stable income with an excess.

It was my own very first credit card I opened back in 2008. I have no balance and haven't had any for the past 5 years. From what I've researched, I understood to avoid retail store credit cards due to high interest rates and they don't have as much impact as big name credit cards do towards your credit score. I have 1,120 available credit. I do have three major credit cards, line of credit, best buy card and a personal loan through my bank. What I would like advice on is would it affect my score negatively to close that one retail store CC? Should I leave it open? Thank you all who help.",finance,1439992889

personalfinance,"Feel overwhelmed, can't seem to get my debt under control (Taxes, Credit Card, Student loans, and Car Payment)","In college, I was extremely stupid and decided I wanted to start a youtube business, but my best friend I couldn't get an investor, so I used by credit card with and $13,500 limit, my 2nd card $2,400, and opened a Best buy card for $1800. In short order, I maxed all three cards. The business wasn't producing enough money to pay me enough to pay for living expenses and credit card debt (SURPRISE!). 

On top of that, I worked as a contractor (before and during this time) and pay taxes on a 1040, so my pay wasn't taxed before I received it. With the business needing money, I didn't have enough to pay any taxes for two years 2012, 2013. The tax debt is still outstanding. I applied for a payment plan, but the IRS turned me down because I never filed my 2012 taxes in an irrational fear that they will suddenly start persuing me to reclaim the money I owe them. At the time of filing the tax returns, I owed approx $5000 for 2012, and $6000 for 2013. In 2014, I only owed $1000 (got new job that takes taxes out of my paycheck). I have no clue how much I owe them now. I do not know how bad the penalties of not paying will be. I also don't know if its worth paying taxes before my high interest credit cards.

In addition, I have federal student loans out for around $12,000. I also have a car payment each month of $550. I am now about 1/2 done paying for my car. Both of these loans are lower interest rates around 5%. 

Last year, I gave up on my dreams of being a youtuber. Letting go hurt bad, but I realized it was leading me to financial ruin. I got a full time job and now make $77,500 a year. 

I have made very little progress paying my credit card debt down because I spent to much on unneeded things and the high interest rate on my credit cards (BestBuy one is at 26%, other two at 16%) make my previous $500 contribution to credit cards each month do almost nothing. And I haven't paid anything toward the taxes that I owe.

I have done my budget: If I don't save any money and don't spend any money on unneeded things, I should be able to pay the following toward my debt after my living expenses, etc:

$550 toward car
$180 toward student loans
$1500 towards whatever debt would be the best to pay off

In addition, I should be able to get approx $3500 from selling stuff around the house that I am not using. 

I guess what I am really wanting to know is this: What would you do in terms of priority? Do I pay my taxes first? How do I even begin paying off what I owe the IRS? Would a consolidated loan to pay off the credit card debt and taxes be a possible option? I feel like a consolidated loan would allow me to reduce my interest rates and give me an easy way to pay out my debt ($1500 dollar payment right after I receive my paycheck each month is what  I am thinking). 
Where would my money best be served? Paying taxes/credit card? What are my options for paying my taxes across multiple years like that?

personalfinance,How do you choose a bank?,"I currently use Regions Bank and a credit union, recently I've been told by someone who has worked at many banks, including Regions, that Regions basically sucks compared to my other options. His main complaint is that regions does not offer very good deals in loans and that they are very strict and have rigid standards as far as giving out loans. My credit union is fine, although the employees seem to not know very much, the customer facing employees at least. Both the credit union and regions mobile apps suck, and I use them a lot. 

I only use my bank for checking and savings at this point, but I'm asking because I'm looking into taking out an auto loan soon, and within the next two years I'd like to buy a house. I'd like to know I chose the best option as far as my bank goes. So as far as comparing interest rates what else should I be on the look out for,

personalfinance,Pay off student loans completely or only high interest before buying a house?,"Owe 30k in total debt (15k student, 15k car) and I am saving/overpaying aggressively to pay these loans off in less than two years. Then the plan is to continue saving aggressively but reallocate that same monthly $ to accumulate at 20% down payment + extra for appliances for a house.

The interest rates are: one at 6.5%, two at 4.5%, one at 3.5% and then two at 1.5%. If I were to revise the plan and pay off those at 6.5 &amp; 4.5 rates first and then start saving for the house, I would have ~8k left at manageable rates and would have a monthly loan payment of $150. This would allow me to start saving for the house sooner, albeit at 150 less each month. I've calculated that this would put me in a house 6 months sooner.

I would appreciate any thoughts or ideas. Thank you.",finance,1440003391
personalfinance,Single Parent: Saving on a Very Tight Budget?,"I need help with creative ways to save money on a very tight budget.  


I am a single mother living in a major metropolitan city in America – I have dual nationality and grew up in Europe (American dad, European mum). I attended university in Europe, but made the mistake of coming to America for graduate school at my father’s urging, where I amassed student loan debt (though not an impossible amount). During the time I was in graduate school I met my daughter’s father – I became pregnant (while on birth control, even) and he encouraged me to keep the child, but by the third trimester he was drinking heavily and became physically and mentally abusive – I tried to get him to seek help, but by the time she was a year old I was having panic attacks every day and I had to leave. I stayed with a friend for a month until I could get enough money together for a small apartment and moved out. After I left him he was ‘let go’ from his job for poor performance and has not worked since. My daughter is now five.  


We live in the cheapest apartment I could find in the area – a 1 bedroom (she has her own room and I use the living room like a studio apartment, with my bed behind a large IKEA bookcase), and she attends a great public school that she loves. I would move somewhere further out but it would mean buying a car (which I cannot afford, and growing up out of the country I never learned to drive), and changing her school – and I really do not wish to do that to her. Despite the fact that her school is a public school, Kindergarten is only 3 hours long and so I must pay the ‘enrichment’ class fee and after school care fee so that I can work; next year in August it will drop to $450 a month, thankfully. I have no debt, other than my student loan. I do not use my credit card, but I keep it for emergencies.  


I have a good job, but because we live in a relatively expensive city, I am stretched very thin. Her father has a child support order (for $600 a month – which doesn’t even cover her school and health insurance) but he has never paid this – his parents pay for his apartment and car, and he sees her one day a week after school (as ordered by the court). Because he does not contribute, I find myself scraping by, despite having a job that pays somewhat well. I do not have family or friends I could live with as my father is deceased (and I did not have a relationship with the American side of my family), and my mother and her family are all back in Europe. I have tried to get a judge to allow me to move back to Europe with my daughter because I need family and financial support, but my daughter’s father’s family has paid for his attorneys who block this, despite him having never paid support – the judge maintains that her relationship with her father is the most important thing – even though I would allow her to visit frequently during school holidays and waive his arrears; he also refused to sign her passport paperwork, so I cannot visit my family or take her on holiday because he feels I am going to kidnap her, despite the fact that my home country is a part of the Hague Convention for Child Abduction.  


My finances look like this:  



Rent: $1200  

Utilities: $100 (when I use air conditioning it goes up to $120 a month, so I do not use it unless it is unbearably hot)  

Student Loans (all Federal loans, no private): $500  

School Fees: $720  

Phone and Internet: Free! (My company pays for these)  

Food, Clothing: $300  

Netflix: $8  

Total: $2828  


I also pay $440 a month in health insurance (pre-tax) and 6% of my income goes to my 401k (which is matched), so my take home is $2900 a month. My last two tax returns went to paying down my student loans, and to eradicating my credit card and medical debt (I was uninsured after leaving her father and I had a lump in my breast removed, which cost thousands). This is the first year that I will be able to save my tax return! I do not have any extra expenses (with the exception of Netflix, because I allow my daughter an hour of television a day and we have ‘movie nights’ on weekends), and I even eat lunch at work (they provide free bread, cheese, fruit, coffee and tea in our break room) to cut down on food costs. I pack her lunch every day (which costs less than her school lunch fees) and I bake our own bread, even. I use a lot of coupons, and I still struggle to keep to my grocery budget of $50 a week.  


I am lucky that I can do graphic design – and I have taken on several projects over the last few years to try to supplement our income, but the work isn’t regular, and my real job is typically 60 hour weeks, so it’s still a struggle. Getting another job in the evenings/weekends would not work since I’d need to pay childcare and that would essentially negate the extra work. My mum is retired and sends gifts/money when she can, but she hasn’t much to give, either. I do not qualify for any public assistance, because my income is considered well above poverty guidelines.  


My tax return should be around $8,000 if I’m calculating correctly – this is a big amount for us, and I want to save it – should I just put the whole amount into savings? Should I invest part of it? Should I pay off a small chunk of my loans? I would love to own our own place someday, but it seems really out of reach, especially since house prices here are very high for one income. I don’t anticipate ever receiving money from her father, and the retainer for a lawyer to request a move overseas is very high. I feel really depressed about our situation, and I hope that eventually I’ll be able to move up in my field, but it takes time. Is there anything I am missing to earn more / save more that I'm overlooking?  


Thank you.

I have taken out a $12,000 personal loan at a lower interest rate to help pay down the high interest portion but have a few questions about the best way to apply this because I would like to see if I can improve my credit and re-negotiate the rates in 6-12 months.

* Does it make any difference to my credit whether I pay off one card completely or pay down two cards?
* Neither of the cards that I am thinking of paying off or down are offering 0% balance transfers to me. I'm guessing that is because of my credit utilization. Is it likely that they will re-offer these to me after paying the cards down? One is a Discover and the other is a Barclays US Airways MC. The best situation I can imagine now is that I pay off one card with the loan and then do a transfer to get the other half on 0% while I am making payments.
* I have a number of other cards that do not have balances that I could close. Most of these accounts have been open for several years and so probably affect my average age of accounts. How do I determine if it is better to have the account open or closed?",finance,1440014294

financialindependence,Am I off to a good start?,"Hi guys,

I'm a college student and part-time freelancer. Last year I made about $6000+ from five months of work pretty much (as I barely do freelance work during college).

I'm approaching my final year now and I'm going to have to look for jobs pretty soon while I expect to continue freelancing (and doing much more of it) especially when I'm done with college. I have about $2000 in my savings account (4% interest rate) and expect to get around $50-100 per month for the foreseeable future.

I've opened another savings account with another bank (6% interest rate) and plan on depositing like $75 each month and not touching this account at all. I was going to invest in mutual funds but I wasn't sure/confident enough about trusting the market. I figured I'd do it after one or two years when I land my first full time job.

My question is, is this a good start? I'm 22 and while $6000 might not be a lot, it is from work I did literally sitting on my ass. A full time job should (hopefully) get me $35k-50k per year. I also plan on getting a credit card solely to help with credit score (I don't spend on things unnecessarily).

Anything else I can do? Tips etc? Thanks in advance!",finance,1440020247

**A little background:** As the title suggests, I just got my MS in the healthcare industry and landed a job making 72k/year. I live in the Bay Area, but my rent is relatively affordable at $1,200/month. I am trying to make quick work of my loans by paying $1,000/month on them (down to 28k right now). All other costs accounted for, I am left with approximately $1000-1300/month to save/spend. 

**The Situation:** My mother is a brilliant woman who immigrated to the United States and met my father (also an immigrant) - they both sacrificed so much for me to get where I am. She has been considering a career switch for several years and now is the best time for her to act on it. She has very poor credit as the result of a bankruptcy a few years back. I have previously cosigned on a car loan for her which she will be completing come February. She needs a loan of $21k to complete a 14 month credentialed program. The institution does not qualify for grants/state/federal loans, so a personal loan is her only option. My credit score is ~780 and I am more than happy to cosign for her. 

**The Question:** With all of the above being said, is it best to:

1. Have her apply for a private loan through SallieMae with me as her cosigner.

2. Take out a private loan through a major credit card company at ~6% and just give her the money in a lump sum.

3. Something else altogether that I haven't even considered?

Is it worth spending all my savings while studying abroad + traveling? I'll be in the Eurozone for four months btw.

personalfinance,Advice on refinancing/ consolidating loans.,"Hi all, I'm a 24yo recent grad and I'm broke as hell.  Graduated in Dec 2014 and have been trying to find my path the last few months.  Money has been really tight these past couple of years, sometimes month to month. A lot of poor spending accounts into that but that's not the advice I'm here for. 

 I made the classic poor decision of pursuing a liberal arts (Spanish, w/ an Italian minor) during school and I'm reaping the stereotypical rewards.  In school, I figured out what my real passion was but unfortunately realized it too late to make an effective change.  I worked for the school's outdoor program and found that I enjoy teaching as an outdoor instructor.  In an attempt to further that passion, I found myself working for REI (A US retail camping store) and have been trying to work my way towards their teaching program.  Unfortunately, at most I probably make about 10 or 12 thousand a year.  

My grace period on my private loans ended this month and I have found myself facing an extra $500 a month in loan payments... On top of the $150/ month I've been paying towards my fed loans, I'm feeling pretty worried.  I had managed to save about $2000 in my checking account, I know it's not much but I'm proud of it considering I'd been month to month for a long time.

I realized today that those payments had been automatically taken out of my account and I find myself facing a big problem.  In a couple months I'm going to find myself out of money and in a bad position. I've been looking into refinancing or consolidating my loans but I don't fully understand what that entails.

I know that basically I ""sell"" the sum of my loans to a 3rd party and get an even interest rate (Current rates are between 7.25 and 10.25).  I also know that I would have just one payment as opposed to 4 or 5.

So I guess my questions are, who consolidates loans? Banks? Other private lenders?

Is it a good idea to consolidate student loans like this?

I'm going to look into a 2nd job or find a better paying job in general.  I was hoping that I could struggle my way through and follow a passion but I'm truly worried that in a couple months I won't be able to afford rent or food. I'm in a bad position and am looking for any advice that might help out.

personalfinance,HR gave my payroll information out to metlife who has been taking money out of my paycheck for a auto policy not in my name,"***EDIT*** Holy crap it is my cakeday! Thank you all for the happy cakeday wishes and of course for helping me with my problem


***EDIT***
So after reading though alot of the comments you guys\gals left I sent an email to the HR supervisor stating that I would like to to see the documentation I signed to authorize this payroll deduction and that if no documentation could be found that they need to stop the payroll deduction immediately and refund me the amount that is owed. I also asked her to write up a itemized list showing the date and amount of each deduction and a total to show exactly what is owed to me (this was of course written very professionally over 3 or 4 paragraphs).

I received a call about 15 minutes later from the supervisor stating she had good news and they talked to metlife who admitted "" They made a keying error that applied an incorrect policy to him. They have since corrected it"".
I told her that was odd since I have no policy with them how can they make a mistake to a non existent policy and on top of that get my payroll information and get funds taken out without my written authorization.  She apologized a lot and said something to the lines of ""Never in my 7 years of working here has this ever happened and it is truly a one off occurrence"" (basically sidestepping the question and giving me a bs answer).

Instead of arguing with her or getting mad, I just verified that the deductions have stopped and that they are sending me a check via fedex that I should get tomorrow. I do not want to get on the bad side of my HR (even though I know this is most likely 100% their fault) as I work in a at will state and can get fired for just about anything. So staying on HRs good side i think is the right more for me.

Thank you all for your help on this issue and for sure you guys have help me speed up the process of getting this resolved.

So the other week I logged into my payroll website to look at my paystub to see how much I would make on payday and I noticed an after tax deduction of $250. I looked back at all my previous paystubs and see metlife has been taking money from my payroll for a few months. I dont have anything with metlife and called my HR department who looked into it and said its for a auto and home insurance policy and they authorized metlife to deduct it from my payroll and if there was an error I would have to call metlfe.

I called metlife and basically talked to 5 or 6 different people who all said I do not have any sort of an account with them and even if I did I would have had to fill out and sign paperwork that they would pass on to my HR department and my HR department would then give them the payroll information for them to take out the money.

I called HR back and basically talked to a few people and a supervisor who said I need to talk to Metlife again, but she will open a ticket on her end to see if she can find out any information.

investing,Effects of Various Economic Conditions on the Markets,"When I asked Pauline about writing a second guest post here, she suggested I talk about factors that will affect the average investor’s retirement nest egg. So in this post, I’ll be discussing the various economic and historical conditions that will affect investors in the medium tern (1-5 years) and long term future (5 to 10 years out), and how you can prepare yourself when each of these conditions hit.

Inflation
Without going into the arcane and pointless details, I’ll explain QE (quantitative easing) in good ole’ plain English. QE is the Federal Reserve’s way of printing money, thereby injecting more and more liquidity (money) into the financial system. Bernake (Fed Chairman) believes that this will pull the American economy out of the muck for good, and right now, whether this is working or not is still questionable.

HOWEVER, quantitative easing does have a problem – the printing of money theoretically speaking should cause inflation. But since QE first began, inflation has been virtually non-existent. How come?

According to theory, printing money causes inflation. BUT, what the economy has been experiencing post-recession is a deflationary environment. The economy isn’t doing too well, and prices should be declining. But with the Fed’s printing of money, the deflation is negated, resulting in zero inflation.

However, sooner or later (probably sooner, along the lines of 1 – 2 years) inflation is going to (finally) pick up. Why? Think of it this way. Deflation has always existed, and the Fed’s printing of money has been negating this deflation. However, soon that negation will be over (when the inflation is sufficient enough to totally negate the deflation), and the printing of money will finally cause real inflation.

So what do you do when inflation hits? Historically speaking, investors think that inflation is bad for stocks. That’s a huge misconception. This misconception only exists because stocks went flat in the 1970s when inflation was huge. HOWEVER, the 1970s were an anomaly – we experienced stagflation, when inflation was coupled with a sagging economy. In most cases, inflation occurs in a growing economy (or in today’s case, a nominally growing GDP). I believe that this time around, the recovery is real and that we’re not going to experience stagflation.

Hence, I think that buying stocks would be great when inflation hits. When inflation comes around, currencies get devalued and nominally speaking stock prices rise, leading to greater returns for equity investors.

Devaluation
Devaluation is closely linked to inflation – when governments print money, the real value of their currencies becomes devalued. Whenever currencies get devalued, all hard assets such as stocks and commodities shoot up in price. Speaking of commodities…

The Once in a Lifetime Opportunity
People believe that precious metals are a hedge against an economic downturn. Again, that’s a misconception. When the 2008 recession hit, precious metals (gold and silver) actually fell the hardest. This misconception originates (again) from the 1970s when a crappy economy was coupled with soaring gold and silver prices.

Precious metals rose in the 1970s not because of the poor economy but because of inflation. The 1970s were a rare case of stagflation, something that doesn’t fit in with today. Currently, the economy is humming along, but inflation will be a big issue. Thus, when inflation starts to creep up it will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for medium term investors who are willing to hold onto their gold and silver positions for at least a year.

The Fight for Resources
There’s a prime fundamental reason (besides inflation) that supports the rise in commodity prices (especially gold and silver). It’s simple. We have fewer and fewer resources to feed a larger and larger population. When Thomas Malthus first predicted that the world would end (this was back in 1798), he forgot to factor in technology. Technological improvements can increase the efficiency at which we extract our resources. HOWEVER, even technology has a limit. The efficiency is ultimately limited to the amount of resources we have. Currently, the world is reaching a turning point. If all the emerging market nations start to consume at the rate Americans do, the world’s resources would be gone sooner rather than later. When the demand for raw materials goes up and the supply goes down, prices will soar.

Historical Charts
You’ve all heard it – historically, the U.S. stock market has yielded (on average) 7.5% returns. That’s actually a really clever lie concocted by brokers and financial groups to get you to purchase equities.

The “average of 7.5%” is from the post-War period. If you look at a different time frame, such as if you were to include the Great Depression, the “average rate of return” is a lot less. That’s what the financial industry does – repackaging facts to make them look better than when they first came in.

The post-war period is actually an anomaly, a period of unprecedented economic growth that is unlikely to be repeated again in the near future. This growth was caused by major technological revolutions, from household appliances to computers to the internet and high speed communications. Today? Come on guys – the market is going to grow at 7.5% with a bunch of undergrads making $0.99 iPhone apps.

My point is, if the stock market is going to pick up its pace in the long run, it needs to be supported by major technological leaps. Unfortunately, since the dawn of the internet our society’s brightest have been attracted towards the fast money of internet riches, drawn away from solid industries that actually contribute to mankind’s life (think of space mining, green energy – the capital intensive industries). Thus, without any major technological revolutions happening right now how can we expect economic and market growth to pick up? We can’t. There’s no driver for the growth engine.

The Summary
To sum it all up, I’m going to divide things into two time frames. The medium time frame is the 1-5 year outlook, whereas the long term outlook is 5-20 years.

For the medium outlook, things are looking decidedly positive. Once inflation picks up (which is inevitable with all the money printing), stocks and commodities are going to soar, particularly gold and silver whose bull markets aren’t over.

However, the long term is less positive. Sure, the stock market will still experience long term bull markets. But I don’t think the average rate of return will be 7.5% anymore, unless we experience another major technological breakthrough. The problem is that these breakthroughs are the results of years and years of work, something that hasn’t happened thanks to all our smartest engineers being attracted to industries that do not really contribute that much to mankind. (I like Facebook as much as the next guy in line, but hey, it hasn’t had as much an impact on my life as the advent of the computer has.)",finance,1440042199

personalfinance,Home Equity Line of Credit to pay off student loans?,"Here's our situation with assets, etc.:

- Wife and I are mid 30s, with a new son. Our combined income is about 95k, and besides mortgage and her student loans, we are both debt-free with excellent credit (lower 800s)

- She has student loans totaling about 66k with an average interest rate of about 6.5%.

- We bought a house in the SF Bay Area about two years ago for 480k, with 380k mortgage at 4.25%. Our neighborhood is VERY quickly gentrifying and market speculation - NOT Zillow - is suggesting that it would currently sell for at least 680k!

- I have stocks in the range of 50k, but don't want to sell because they were big gainers and the tax hit would be tough. And we aren't currently putting anything significant away for retirement, but are generally thrifty and keep an emergency fund of about 20k at any given time.

So the idea would be to use a Home Equity Line of Credit to pay off her students loans. Our original mortgage loan officer is saying we could do anything up to 100k for about 3.75%, thus essentially moving the loans so that they are at almost half the interest rate. 

I generally tend to be horribly cautious about this sort of thing, but it kinda sounds like it could be a good idea. She also has family that have been incredibly successful in real estate (retired Bay Area realtors), that are saying it's a no-brainer. But I keep thinking about what would happen if there's another bubble waiting to burst here... They are suggesting we do 100k, use some of the remaining 30k on updating the house, and keep the rest available for emergencies. I'm not opposed to this, but am leaning more towards 75k...

cybersecurity,Cybersecurity: Age of Innocence Gone or No More Plausible Deniability by Bob Carver,"Hi Folks,

Today we would like to share with you a great article by Bob Carver. Enjoy!

Copyright © 2015 Bob Carver CISM, CISSP, M.S.

Addressing C-Suites, Boards and anyone that is vested in knowing the current state of cybersecurity.

Rarely do we see massive popups anymore, nor PC’s grinding slowly to a crawl post-infection.  The scenario is now more like a Ninja in the middle of the night that deals a silent death blow, that turns your system into a Zombie with no telltale signs of compromise. Often there are no executables; it may be considered “fileless” infection. All the evidence of malware that security monitoring systems traditionally look for are not present.  The compromised are completely unaware without awakening their AV, traditional IDS or firewalls from their slumber.

Almost daily we are hearing about breaches. Fortelus Capital Management LLP, JP Morgan Chase, U.S. government’s OPM, Anthem Healthcare, ECB, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, Belgium’s foreign ministry, Germany’s government web sites and the list goes on, almost forever.

Yet I hear from people, “I haven’t gotten infected in years”.  “How do you know?”, I ask.  Their answer is “My AV hasn’t alarmed on anything.” I respond, “That may not be a reliable indictor.”

One recent report by Anti-Virus Kaspersky rated the risk of infection by country. The UK was at 33.8%, the US 34.4% risk. On the high end (in the EU) is Spain with 40.9% and Denmark has a relatively stellar 21.3% risk of infection. The rest of the EU countries are somewhere in the middle of this pack.

The risk of your personal PC being infected is approximately one in three, give or take, depending upon where you live.

 

Ironically two of the top three Anti-Virus suites for home users of Windows 8.1 have recently been hacked by cybercriminals (Kaspersky and Bitdefender).

Cybercriminal organizations and nation-states have access to all brands of anti-virus security suites, IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) and firewalls. If they don’t personally have access, they hire third party cybercriminal organizations to test against all of these security systems before they release their malware or attacks into the wild, almost guaranteeing success of not being detected.

“Antivirus is dead” says Brian Dye, Symantec’s senior vice president for information security. In early 2014 he estimated that their anti-virus could only stop 45% of malware attacks.

In 2015, the number of new malware has exploded. We have already hit 1.5 million new unique samples of malware each day, causing AV companies to be unable to keep up with the pace. It has been estimated if AV companies only used traditional signature-based detection, their databases would require disk space exceeding the vast majority of modern day corporate PC’s.

Currently, this author estimates that more advanced attacks and larger volumes has brought the effectiveness of AV to as low as 20 – 25% for new attacks (in the first 48 hours to 2 weeks after the malware is released).

If your mobile or a kitchen appliance only worked 25% of the time you attempted to use it, most people would toss it in the bin and purchase a new one.

Mobiles. Do you let them on your corporate Wi-fi network? Some variants of mobile malware have been known to transfer from the mobile to PC’s. Also, mobile infections are reported at higher levels in the UK and EU than in North America. For some reason the U.S. and Canadian mobile users are more paranoid and will often restrict their software downloads from Google and Apple App Stores yielding a lower infection rate.

Patching – yes patching of desktop PC’s should take place as quickly as possible. 95% within the first week should be a good goal. Update Windows, Java, Adobe Flash, Microsoft Office and your browsers to the latest version.

I have talked to risk managers that believed that if you only had a fully patched system, you would never see PC’s compromised. I have seen compromised PC’s that were fully patched and compliant starting approximately seven years ago. The mantra should be if a PC get’s compromised because patches were not rolled out in a timely manner “Shame on me.” However, fully patched PC’s will most likely continue to get compromised, regularly, unless they have moved to a more sophisticated, next generation endpoint protection.

What should be the “New Normal?”

Consider all systems on your network as untrusted (even network printers and IoT Internet of Things) and plan accordingly.
Assume current generation anti-virus will not save you from compromise or infection.
Start investigating next generation endpoint security, looking for methods such as containerization so infections will not be able to penetrate and write to the operating system.
First Generation IDS will not detect many of the latest attacks and malware, usually based on relatively static signatures. If they do detect, the attack will change rendering the signature worthless in short order.
Look at next generation intrusion detection systems that look at traffic to and from malicious domains and IP’s on a dynamic basis, not static signatures.
Assume any new sophisticated malware has been tested against all traditional AV, IDS systems and firewalls.
Assume First Generation security will not stop or detect the majority sophisticated attacks.
Assume some entity or cybercriminal has already gotten into your network or compromised one or more systems and is already inside.
In the past we have been concerned about attacks from the outside. Now we need to be concerned about attacks and traffic from the inside.
In the past we spent more time monitoring traffic attempting to get in our networks, now we need to monitor outbound traffic on all ports, protocols both standard and non-standard.
Remember modern day cybersecurity is a highly dynamic environment, changing every day, if not by the minute. Governance utilizing standards such as NIST, ISO and ITIL are a good start, but should be considered the “low bar” and not the final destination.

Modern day cybercriminal Ninjas just laugh at traditional barriers provided by compliance standards of governance.

personalfinance,Best use of HSA when dropping HDHP for PPO? [Insurance],"I'm dropping my Aetna HDHP for a PPO through my employer, due to adding a maintenance Rx.  This change saves a lot of money, but I am trying to figure out how to best handle my HSAs.  Specifically, I want to know if I should add more money and if investment is worthwhile long-term or not for HSA Bank with my balance?  If you're using HSA Bank, are you using investment, and if so, which one?

**I have two HSAs:** 

* **Previous Chase HSA with $3300** (last employer), which is converting into HSA Bank in the next week to month. Fees will be $2.50/month maintenance fee (waived with $5000 in account), plus $3/month if I use investment.  I can't speak for HSA Bank yet, but Chase has been quite wonderful.
* Current employer has a PayFlex HSA, which is... terrible and has a reputation for not paying.  It will hit $1200 in contributions by end of benefit period. I plan to roll this entirely into my larger HSA Bank account.
* I have waived the flexible spending account option this year because I can use the HSA and because frankly all signs are that the FSA will be terrible and take more time to deal with than the money is worth.

**Estimated medical costs:**

* Big unknown, I am generally in good health but with maintenance medication, expect about $350-400/yr in guaranteed after-deductible costs (it would be nearly $1500 with HDHP)


**HSA Bank apparently has two investment options:**

* TD Ameritrade (brokerage fees apply, amount unknown, no idea on other fees), supposedly includes no-fee purchase of Vanguard ETFs (my preference)
* Denevir mutual funds (addition $24/year fee), no transaction charge, no idea about investment offerings

New benefits come into effect Oct 1, so I have a short window where I can add money to my HSAs by direct contribution, and could add up to $1200 or so.  Most of my income falls squarely in the 25% tax bracket. 

I am thinking that it would be worthwhile to roll everything into one account and max out my contribution, at least avoiding the maintenance fee.  If the stock market corrects for its current high, then I set up blended equities/bonds investing.  I'm holding off buying bond funds because interest rate changes are coming.

People who have HSA Bank, which investment options are you using, and is it worthwhile?  

Also, should I contribute more to my HSA while I still can, or try to run the balance down to avoid being slowly bled by fees, and then switch to using an FSA?",finance,1440076365
personalfinance,Suspicious Job Questions,"Hello, all, there are a number of questions in this post, some of which may or may not be beyond the scope of this subreddit. I appreciate any tips. I am a student and currently looking for a job. I found an interesting position on Craigslist for a French publishing company. My job would be to receive several orders of books at my apartment and ship them to their US clients through their FedEx account for $500 a week. I have a few questions, though. Is this sort of thing common or make sense From the publishers perspective? I would also recieve checks from customers, out of which I would pull my income out of (after a 48 hour clearing period) only to then transfer the rest to the publisher. As I said, the whole thing sounds weird. What prevented me from immediately saying no is that they have no critical information of mine and I see no real way for them to scam me in any typical way. How do taxes work, since I'd have all this money going through my account? If there is something fishy going on, does it make sense to take the job and be an informant?",finance,1440076842
personalfinance,Negotiating with Private Student Loan Companies,"Hello all, this is my first time posting on PF. I have seen a lot of success here so I thought I would dive in.

My wife (30) and I (29) both have a tremendous amount of student loan debt from music conservatory (please don't just say that this was a bad decision as this has been clear as day at this point.) Most of her and my loans are federal and therefore under the new student loan laws which give us a lot of flexibility and hope for a future. However, my wife also has about $100,000 in private loans from Navient and we are about to default. We both work constantly and after our move simply don't make enough money to make a payment this month (I work in IT now, she teaches). The thing about private loan companies is that when you don't pay, they immediately put you in default. We have exhausted all the companies forebearance options, and the payment is about to be due. It would be less bad if my wife's parents weren't the cosigners and her mom is currently on disability for mental issues from being bullied as a teacher by her administration. We really cannot make this payment, and I'm really not sure what to do. 

My question is: is there anything we can do to negotiate, delay, or anything with this company? My dad is a lawyer and he's trying to help us, but this isn't really his area, so I was wondering if PF has any experience or tactics in these situations. 

Please be gentle, we are trying very hard to manage this.

Thank you.",finance,1440078602

My dad is 63 and retired but he has a son, my brother who is 7.  My dad collects his social security in addition to $400 a month because he has a depended child, which is half of my dad's $800 a month social security, so he gets a total of $1200 before taxes.

The Social Security office sent him a letter asking him for an ""accounting report"" - how much he has spent on child care expenses.  Does he have to tell them?  There is no way for me to know exactly how much we spent but it's easily of 10,000 (he is spoiled).  I don't want to open a can of worms with SSA and have to provide them receipts and other evidence to support my claim.

I am asking this because I was audited by the IRS last year and tried to deceive me into providing other financial data that was not a part of the scope of my audit.  I know this is a trick the government uses to get by the law.  

After my experience with the IRS, i do not want to deal with anyone in the federal government.  Obviously, my audit found no errors but i had a terrible experience working with the agents and the manager.

My goal is to stay with this highly stable job for at least 3-5 years (somewhere in there the childbearing will begin) and then move to something more moderate. My partner is an artist so I can't plan on any consistent income from that, and he lives too far away from my work so I will have to get another place closer. I recently sold a condo in my college town and got $90k back (my father cashed in $55k at the beginning along with my cash contribution and has gifted it to me now to use either as a down payment or to pay back student loans). 

My conundrum is that I don't know where to put this money: should I pay back student loans at all costs (they are federal, so have the benefit of extremely flexible repayment terms in case anything goes awry, but the detriment of 6-8% interest rates), use it to invest in a home I could grow into (the extent of my purchasing power seems to be $650k, which would buy 3ish bedrooms in my market - or something with a great room that could be used as an urban art studio), or invest half into buying a smaller place ($350-450k, which I would probably rent out once I need something bigger) and half into student loans. I have heard that I should invest in the highest amount of real estate I can get my hands on just because the transaction costs are so high. Or are there other routes I should consider like immediately contributing to a retirement plan or more aggressive investments? I would also like to have enough assets after 5 years to catch up in retirement savings (I am 27) and have enough saved in case I want to try my dream career of opera singing.

Here are all the numbers - if you like math and figuring this out - HAAAALP please!! 

- Gross annual income for the years at this job would be: 160k, 170k, 185k, 210k, 230k plus variable bonuses. 
- For the first year that's about $7,700 per month net income, which includes 10% of net income deducted for charitable donations (religious).
- $90,000 in savings (newly released assets)
- $104,000 in student debt (principal and interest) with interest rates ranging from 5.41-7.9%, of course I will pay the highest interest ones off first! :)
- If I did not buy a home, apartment rental payment would be $2-2.5k per month, whereas mortgage would range from $2.5k-3.5k per month

personalfinance,Student Loan payoff with Stock Account?,"I have a quick question about the trade off of paying off my wife's student loan balance. 

Here is the rundown on the student loan:

* The original term was 15 year with an interest rate of 12.75% through Sallie Mae.
* The original amount taken out was between $22,000-$24,000
* We have been paying $300 per month for just about 5 year and have 10 years left on the loan. 
* The current payoff of the loan is just under $20,000.

Now, I have a mutual fund account that has a bit more money than the payoff amount. It should be enough to cover the necessary capital gains taxes plus the payoff of the student loan.

Now for the performance of the mutual fund account:

* From 2009 - 2010 it saw a return of 2%
* From 2010 - 2011 it saw a return of 13%
* From 2011 - 2012 it saw a return of 15%
* From 2012 - 2013 it saw a return of 18%
* From 2013 - 2014 it saw a return of 26%
* From 2014 - current is saw a return of 4%

It obviously saw a decent return when the economy was recovering, but seems to be falling flat now.

personalfinance,Advice for buying a pool.,"Okay guys I need some expert advice. Let me explain my financial situation. I have two bank accounts in one bank account I have $25,000 in a second bank account I have $50,000. I enjoy having a large amount of money because it makes me feel very safe and secure. I want to buy a pool really bad. The pool will be about $46,000. I do not want to spend all the money immediately because it will leave my emergency bank account down to only 4000. So this means I need to get some kind of loan. The two things I have thought of are an unsecured loan which I qualified for. I would spend $25,000 in cash and loan out another 25000 over 60 months at 6.24 interest. This would leave around 25000 in my emergency account. Another possibility is a secured savings loan. Which would use my savings of $50,000 as collateral. The interest rate is 2.75 and the payments can go up to a hundred months or so. The bad thing with this is I cannot withdraw money from my savings in case of emergency until that part of it is paid off and released from the secured loan. I know I can just pay for the pool in cash and use the money that I would use to pay off loans to put in savings but it would take me a long time to have that kind of money. In the worst case scenario I want to be able to default on a pool loan and still have money in my bank account to bail myself out of any bad spot(maybe litteraly bail). What do you experts think?

Growing up, my family never talked much about finances.

 I moved states away from family when I was 18 yrs old and made some young and stupid choices, financially speaking. Fortunately, I didn't make any huge purchases. Just little things I never paid off, like once I opened a Macy's Credit Card just because they offerred me 20% off whatever I was buying at the time if I did. Then I never paid off that purchase. When the creditors started calling, I was too afraid to answer.

So...The creditors have ceased their calling but I KNOW I have outstanding debt out there, that I'd ideally like to pay off so I can start rebuilding my credit.

I recently applied for a CC for airline miles as I travel home frequently to visit my family and got denied because of ""outstanding debt"". The problem is, I've grown up and become a lot more financially responsible (not that credit card companies care about that) - and again, no creditors are calling me anymore and I have no idea whatsoever who to contact or how to figure out what I owe so I can pay it back. I am too embarrassed to ask how to find out what debt I owe to my friends or family and admit my shortcomings.

 I've seen you all offer very helpful advice and was hoping you could show me the way on how to start A) Find out my debt balance B) Start paying off my debt in a smart, financially responsible manner.. Do i have any wiggle room for negotiating my debt? Or the interest rate I pay off on it?

They have not responded to my emails yet and their phone lines are extremely busy, so I have many things to worry about like: I'm supposed to move in this Sunday on the 23rd, one of the consequences of not paying is that all my university services will be suspended until I make the payment, will I not be able to move in? I guess that's a question only my university can answer. What I want to do is: I could take out a private loan right now to pay for the $1000 fee I owe them and use the $3500 subsidized loan I am waiting on to pay back the $1000 loan. Is this even possible? Will that $3500 be available for me to spend or does my school keep all of that and is returned as a refund at the end of the year? This is my first time ever dealing with loans and money of this value, I am so lost and stressed and need a little guidance. I know this is all my fault, and that I should have gone through the process of getting my loan before the deadline, but I need a solution for the problem I have now.",finance,1440111465

Well the title is the totality of my debts currently. Before I break it down I'll explain a little about myself. I am 24 yo, married ( wife is interning at a hair salon currently), and I make +/-35K annually.

3.5K Car Loan
5.9K Federal Student Loan
2.5K CC Debt

I just picked up YNAB ( youneedabudget) to keep track of my spending. I currently have no emergency savings and a very small retirement started but I have no idea how much is in it right now. We need a second car since my wife whats to start working soon. And my commute to work doesn't lend itself very well to a one car situation. We also would like to buy a house in the near future but in order for that to happen I'm pretty sure I'm going to need a down payment of at least 15-20K just to get approved.

ethereum,Are there any plans for official Ethereum builds for Fedora/RHEL/CENTOS?,"I typically run Fedora on all of my computers.  Unfortunately, I had to remove Fedora 22 and install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my laptop to get geth running (couldn't get Ubuntu running properly in VM).  According to Distrowatch, Fedora is the 5th most popular Linux distro: http://distrowatch.com/


*Are there any plans to officially support Fedora/RHEL/CENTOS with geth, Mist, and other Ethereum software?*


I have already taught my employer about Red Hat, Fedora, and Bitcoin in baby steps.  I plan on introducing them to Ethereum a little bit later.  First, I want to get them to buy into the Red Hat ecosystem to shift them to open source: employees running Fedora and/or Centos at home, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) at work. 

 I think that Ethereum is going to have a huge impact within the business community, so I thought that now might be the appropriate time to start a discussion about officially supporting RHEL, Fedora, and CENTOS.  As far as I know, RHEL is the most popular linux distribution for businesses in the United States.

I know that Red Hat ships without some cryptographic packages due to patent restrictions, but perhaps the required packages could be added and maintained in the repositories at http://rpmfusion.org/ . RPM Fusion provides software that the Fedora Project or Red Hat doesn't want to ship.

**Update: I intially tried to get Ubuntu 14.04 LTS running on my Fedora 22 desktop using VirtualBox.  That failed with some obscure kernel error.  Last night, I successfully got it running using Fedora's KVM VM.  I successfully installed geth on the new Ubuntu VM.  Today, I'll take the next step of trying to get geth running directly on Fedora, as described in the comments below.**",cryptocurrency,1440129289

btc,Why I'm not concerned about Bitcoin XT,"Disclaimer: I'm a nobody, no PhD, although I am a software engineer. I own a lot of Bitcoins. I love opensource and I got into Bitcoin because of Ron Paul educating me about the theft perpetuated by the ""Federal"" Reserve.

I'm not worried about Bitcoin XT killing Bitcoin.

There have been many threats to Bitcoin in the form of altcoins in the past. For example, Litecoin was invented because people thought Bitcoin was DOOMED TO FAIL since mining would become centralized due to highly specialized ASIC chips. But as time went on, and various ""51% attack"" dangers were mitigated, people stopped caring about it and Bitcoin continued to lead.

Then there was Dogecoin, because people thought Bitcoin was DOOMED TO FAIL since it didn't adopt a feeling of good will among people and the social aspect is what makes free software succeed. Although Dogecoin certainly gained a lot of popularity, it didn't gain a lot of value. And Bitcoin continued to lead.

And now comes Bitcoin XT, another altcoin, because people think Bitcoin is DOOMED TO FAIL since it doesn't increase the blocksize and thus will prevent Bitcoin from being usable in the long run. 

The reason I think this is nonsense is that I believe that the Bitcoin developers have no intention of hurting Bitcoin, and they have a lot of incentive to fix this problem somehow. Everyone understands the RISK of not solving it soon. The core developers are not dumb people. They know if they delay solving the problem, it could be just as bad as NOT solving the problem. And thus, I know that they will come up with a fair solution that they can all agree with.

The pressure on Bitcoin and on the core developers is a very healthy one. It isn't a sign of sickness, it's a test to see how the core developers perform.

And by all means, I welcome Bitcoin XT in the ecosystem as much as I welcome Litecoin and Dogecoin and any other challenger to Bitcoin. Because they add pressure to Bitcoin. And this pressure will only make Bitcoin stronger, as long as the Bitcoin core developers want Bitcoin to succeed. It makes no sense to me that they would allow it to just die, because they make decisions based on what is technically sound.

And it's possible that the Bitcoin developers will fail to address the issue this time, and Bitcoin XT wins over the crowd. But again, I didn't sign up for Bitcoin so that it would be the most POPULAR digital currency (otherwise I would have used Dogecoin) or because it would be the most UNCENTRALIZED digital currency (otherwise I would have used Litecoin). I signed up because IT PROTECTS MY VALUE. I don't care so much that I can't buy coffee with it. There is no DEMAND for that in the current market where you can use Visa or Mastercard for that nonsense. I don't care so much that I can't run my own node. I only care that it protects my wealth first and foremost. Everything else is just a nice-to-have. I don't care if Bitcoin is doing a million transactions per second or just 25. If it's slow, fine, whatever.

We'll see what happens with some healthy competition, and I'm fine with people selling their Bitcoin and buying Bitcoin XT instead (or mining). But I'm not moving my Bitcoin until I see a threat to the one thing I care about, which is protecting my wealth against the government.

Bitcoin is the honeybadger of cryptocurrencies. And it WILL adapt and it WILL evolve. And every time it's challenged and adapts to that challenge, it becomes even HARDER to beat it. I believe once there is consensus among the core developers and it's changed, then Bitcoin XT will die a quick death.

I could be wrong, but my faith in Bitcoin is equal to my faith in the mathematics, and a hard fork which changes the mathematics where not all the core developers agree on it, is a hard fork worth ignoring to me.",cryptocurrency,1440135696
investing,What if the dollar corrects instead of equities?,"I keep reading about people holding tons of cash in anticipation of a correction because apparently everything is overvalued and the fed raising rates a quarter of a point a year will make everyone flee stocks en masse.  But what if the opposite were to occur?  What if a bluffing fed and continuation of QE (or some other macroeconomic/geopolitical chain of events) caused the dollar to fall sharply in a short period of time?  Would equities not become drastically more expensive as the relative purchasing power of the dollar fell?

In other words, if someone sells 80% of their holdings so that they can sit on a pile of cash and wait for a correction that may never come, isn't there a significant risk of everything going in the opposite direction instead -especially when the dollar is currently so strong?  Wouldn't the best strategy be to simply have a widely-diversified portfolio, perhaps favoring a slightly above-average cash allocation due to current market fears?

I only ask this out of my own insecurity about the market and my inability to fully understand the complex relationship between the dollar and U.S. equities.  I think the effect of a strengthening/weakening dollar on imports and exports is pretty clear-cut, but beyond that it gets foggy and rather unpredictable for me in my limited education and experience.

Each loan I've taken out has an interest rate of either 6.8%, 5.6%, 4.5%, &amp;  3.4%. My dad told me about a different strategy for paying off my loans that could work better in my favor. 
Instead of paying it off through Nelnet and having my interest continuing to accrue, my dad suggested that I get a credit card instead, pay off the 30k completely, and continue making payments to my new credit card at 0% apr for the first year. That way I'm still increasing my credit score and not accruing interest. Once one year is over and it hasn't been paid off completely, he suggests to get another new credit card, pay my past credit card off completely, and continuing doing the same strategy for the new credit card at 0% apr for another year. If I do this, I'd pay a few hundred per month (I'm not sure of a set monthly payment just yet). 
He's called the local bank here and confirmed with them that this is doable and he made an appointment to solidify everything in person in two days. In good faith, my dad's trying to think of the best possible way for me to pay off my loans, but I'm hesitant as I'm not finance savvy and unsure if this would be the best decision.
Would it really help my credit score or hurt it? Do many people take this route? What are the pros and cons? Everything should be legal? What should I look out for? Any expert opinion/ advice would be greatly valued. Thanks for the help in advanced!

Together we bring in around £64- £70K per year. Have no credit card debts, and owe around £10K on a loan (2.9% interest rate) that was used to renovate the property we are now in. On a normal month I can put away 1K into my savings, whilst still paying all the bills etc. I do not have a pension other than the state pension. 

So as the saying goes when you get lemons make lemonade, well I have just been given my share of lemons it seems in the way of a brain tumor, and am looking how to make lemonade. Fortunately I took out a critical illness policy before all this started so will be expecting a lump sum of approx 134K (enough to pay off outstanding mortgage as we only moved in 1 year ago) to use as I please.

What would be the best move with this money?

The mortgage I have is a tracker and I am paying £735 per month (3.9% above base rate). From where I am sitting right now there seem to be only one or so options (my judgement is a little clouded as I have a stomping headache).

Do I:

A) Pay off the mortgage in full, start saving again and purchase another property, keeping my current also and rent it out, this would bring me a rental income of around £600-£700 a month. I could then repeat this process to purchase further properties down the line. 

B) Pay off part of the mortgage, use the rest as a deposit on a new place?

C) Invest the money somehow? your suggestions and guidance are much appreciated?

i was wondering about options to pay off some debt without a personal loan, unless that’s deemed the best option in which case I would look into it.    for some background,  we moved into a new house and ate through the budget pretty quickly so put more than originally planned on credit, had some pet issues that cost an arm and a leg with a recurring 150$ bill per month, plus was already carrying some for my SO college (financial aid wouldn’t help her so we did it ourselves hoping that her work college reimbursement would cover it all).  I know its not the best way to go, but thought it would be manageable with the budgeting and planning we had in place.  hindsight 20/20.  Now that credit is still looming and a constant stress on both of us. with it payed off savings for other needs/wants would grow and actually allow us to relax a little.  

budget allows for 1100 per month in savings, not all that is for credit cards right now as the emergency fund still needs built as well as a small amount go into investments.  roughly 750 per month go towards credit, minimums are taking about 400 a month split amongst multiple cards and different limits.

Will use the tax return to put a large dent into this as well come the q1 of next year

Questions im hoping to answer with your help,

Emergency fund &gt; putting it towards the pile of debt? 

Investment account isn’t huge as its only a slow growing long term plan, is around 1300 bucks. Is it better to keep that going or close it out and put towards the debt? I’ve read about if the gains are less than the amount of interest it may be a better idea to pull it out and put towards the snowball but am not certain as it was a personal goal a little while back to establish some investments

is there a way to refinance and get a decent amount of liquid cash back? i keep getting spam mail about it but the paper looks so not legit I’m hesitant and i can’t find a good site laying out how they work.  refi for a lower house payment (interest rate etc) as well as getting some cash back would be awesome.    Ho wmuch can I get with this if it is the best option?

goal is to pay off credit cards and/or pay off cars in order to put that monthly bill towards the credit cards and savings after the CC payoff as well.

currently snowballing but seems so insignificant that would take forever.   all credit cards are put up and no longer being used until payed to 0 balance.

personalfinance,It seems I can't set up auto-pay on my students loans to post a few days before my due date. A couple questions...,"Hi everyone, 
I read through this subreddit frequently and have learned so much already, thanks!

I am paying my students loan off in full each month through Firstmark Services. My payment is due monthly on the 4th. I have been reading the Suze Orman book, ""Young Fabulous and Broke"" and she suggests making payments a few days in advance, giving it time to clear before the 4th of the month, for example. 
I just called my loan provider to see if I can move my Auto pay schedule to the 1st of the month, ensuring that it will post by the 4th (when the 4th falls on a weekend for example, it may not post until the 7th). The guy I spoke to said if I wanted to make the payments on the 1st, they would change the due date to the 1st, essentially bringing my problem back to square one. 
Of course, I could opt out of Auto pay and manually pay it myself on the 1st, but my interest rate will go up by 0.25% (this was a deal set up by them, by enrolling in Auto pay, they lowered my interest rate 0.25%). 

Could this possibly be hurting my credit score by paying it on the due pay, and not having it post until a few days later? Is something I should be concerned about? Or is this pretty standard practice? 

Thanks for any suggestions/advice!",finance,1440172522

1. I make $140,000.00 per year. 

2. Total monthly obligations are  $6,500.00

3. I have a VA loan at 3.75% and my mortgage is $1,761.00

4. I owe back taxes of $20,000.00 and am paying $450.00 per month toward those taxes.  

5. Motorcycle payment is $210.00 and I owe 6000.00 with a 20% interest rate (ouch)

6. Student loans are $304 per month and $8000.00 total at 15% interest (again, ouch)

7. Truck payment of $761.00 per month and owe just over $44,000.00 at 4.05%

investing,Lets Look at the S&amp;P 500 Long-term &amp; the Potential for an Upcoming Bear Market,"Ive been following the global markets for some time. Many indicators seem to be pointing towards a market correction, similar to that of 2000, and 2008. Here are some of my inclinations as to why:


**1.** S&amp;P 500 long term looks like this: http://imgur.com/rSrdnB9
(Compared to 2000, and 2008, we are significantly higher. This is likely directly caused by QE, and the Fed's near 0 interest rates. We peaked a full 600 points higher than the top in 2000 AND 2008)

**2.** Fed QE after 2008 crash injected a little over $3.5 TRILLION dollars into the US monetary supply. Much of this went into the banks, and then into the market. (For perspective, a trillion $ is to a million $, as a million $ is to ONE $) Visual Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tym9AhMNcP0

**3.** Oil is at $40 a barrel, last time it was here was 2009, near the bottom of the crash.

**4.** Most commodities seem to be in the shitter

**5.** China (speaks for itself)

**6.** Europe (again, speaks for itself) + their 60 Billion new Euro printed a month with their QE stimulus plan.

**7.**  Housing market is at the same levels it was in 2007. It was a bubble then..But its healthy now?? Right.


There are more reasons, but those are the main ones that come to mind. My main takeaway is that the last 6 or so years have seen nothing but up for the S&amp;P. This cannot go on forever, no matter how rosy your outlook on the future is. The only question now, is when does the market correct. To me, where we are now looks remarkably like where we were in early 2000, and 2008. 


The Fed is pushing back an interest rate hike, which was one of their main weapons in combating the 2008 crash. Now, if there is another crash, their greatest defense will be a return to QE, as lowering interest rates will no longer be an option.

Bitcoin,Why not form a Bitcoin Credit Union?,"I have a background in the banking industry and something I've been curious about is the lack of a bitcoin credit union. I've seen discussions surrounding this topic in the past but they've all degenerated into basically, ""screw the system."" Past the rhetoric, I've yet to see a good answer. 

A common complaint in the Bitcoin community is the lack of flexibility in the financial sector. Bitcoin users often have their accounts suspended or shutdown and many Bitcoin startups struggle to even open a business account. This is because of BSA, Patriot Act, and the overall regulatory burden on the banks. And to be honest, I can't exactly blame the banks for not wanting to work with bitcoin participants. Large financial institutions would have to rework their compliance processs to accomodate the bitcoin industry. This gets progressively harder the larger you are. Small banks have their compliance process built and bought off the shelf from third party contractors and software vendors so they don't have to expertise to modify their compliance process.

So why doesn't anyone in the bitcoin community form a bitcoin credit union with a compliance process that is developed in-house for the purpose of working with the bitcoin community? Treat it like a startup and build the processes out from the bottom up. In execution it is not that difficult. I know because I've done it. Compliance would be difficult for credit products but this bitcoin credit union wouldn't need to offer credit products in the beginning. Instead, it would just serve as a way for bitcoin participants to have a connection to the existing financial infrastructure. Bitcoin startups could now have a place to store their money without worrying about their account closing randomly or their funds being frozen. Without a willing financial partner, I can't see the bitcoin ecosystem evolving at the pace we want it to. 

This is not something that can be done through the traditional VC funding method. Why? Well because 1) regulators don't accept VC money for community institutions and 2) credit unions are a not-for-profit. This is my theory as to why this has not been done yet. 

However, many people do not realize that credit unions are very different from banks in turns of regulatory burden and difficulty in formation. In terms of a cost perspective, this could be done for $300k. I understand that this is no small sum but in the grand scheme of things, this could grow into the banking house of bitcoin. 

Please comment below. I'm in the middle of a credit union formation and I'm seriously considering forming another one for bitcoin. I've learned from experience that the community here always has great insights that I've missed so I would love your input. 

*Note: I have legal counsel already. The costs are calculated and the application processes is already planned out. I'm only hesitant because I can't think of a solid reason as to why this has not been done yet.

*Note: Regulator approval is not a big worry because this credit union will not be chartered at the federal level. It will be chartered at the state level (there is a specific state in mind) and the regulators there are willing to accept it as long as no credit products are offerred.",cryptocurrency,1440180566

personalfinance,"Tax, Investing, &amp; Prioritization Assistance","r/pf,

While this post might be better suited to specific subreddit x-posts, I'm hoping this central point of personal finance knowledge might be best suited to assist with...

* Tax knowledge
* Investing and it's account-type prioritization
* Budgeting

**Overview**

Married couple in early 30s, no kids, resident of a state with no income tax, and filing jointly.

* Husband: $225,000 base salary, typical year end bonus of $75,000
* Wife: $50,000 base salary, typical year end bonus of $5,000

*401k Setup*

* Husband: No access to a company matching 401k
* Wife: Company matching 100% up to max limit of $18,000

The only outstanding debt is for one of the vehicles with $22,000 remaining on it @ 1.90% interest rate.  No student loans. No mortgage.

**Assets**

The joint liquid assets (excluding vehicles) are as follows:

* Cash = $50,000
* Taxable Investments = $300,000
* Wife Old 401k = $8,000
* Wife New 401k = $36,000
* Husband Traditional IRA = $5,500

No ownership of property. Non-liquid investments include start-up angel investing.

**Tax**

Based on the non-liquid investments mentioned above, K1 losses for 2014 were approximately $310,000.

&gt; First tax question, assuming there were total losses in 2014, can you roll-forward this negative balance (in full? cap?) as part of a NOL into 2015 and beyond?

&gt; Second tax question, is there a best practice tax strategy in dealing with future years income, NOL, and tax brackets?

**Investing &amp; Prioritization**

When it comes to investing, we have historically been poor at using tax efficient practices (example: utilizing IRAs, 401k).  We have also been poor at diversified ETF investing (opting for direct investment in large / mid cap companies).

&gt; Investing question, what is the optimum strategy to maximize the tax efficiency of the U.S. system?  Wife is currently contributing to max of $18,000 in 401k (and receiving 100% match).  Husband is contributing $5,500 per year via low-cost Vanguard ETFs, including initial level of tax efficiency asset allocation (ex: muni-bonds in taxable accounts; corporate bonds in IRA).

**Budgeting**

We have never historically budgeted on a monthly basis, but have recently started to look closer at our spending habits.

&gt; Budgeting question, are there guides as to typical monthly spend rates for different areas / ways of living.  We are having to cut back to spend at $7,000 per month, yet reading articles about pro-NFL players living on $5,000 per month.

Apparently, someone tried to charge ~$500 twice and ~$200 once onto my credit card somewhere in Brazil.  

This particular card, since it doesn't give any rewards, is kept around only to increase my available credit and the way I keep it open is to have an autopay for a credit reporting company (Identity Guard) come out once a month. It resides in a bank box.  

**A:** I just got a notice from said company that my bank issued a ""Credit Alert"" to my report that my card was ""Lost or Stolen"".  

**Is this a good or bad thing?** I guess I feel miffed since I don't actually use this card for general purchases at all, let alone in in an unsafe way.

**B:**  I got my statement from the bank and it shows 2 of the charges (about $800) on there, which means they reported an $800 balance to my credit report.  

**Will having a sudden large balance reported (on a $3,000 limit) affect my scores?** I haven't shown more than a $10 balance any month for over a year, now it looks like I'm suddenly charging 26% of my limit.

- Checking account: $2,700 (including the last paycheck I'll get next week).

- Savings account I set up specifically for this trip: $10,520. 0.99% interest rate.

- Regular savings account: $25,135. The plan is to not touch any of this money while I'm gone unless it's absolutely necessary. I'd like to have it available when I get home in case of a down payment for a house or something similar. 0.99% interest rate.

- Credit card 1: $675 balance, $5,000 total available credit.

- Credit card 2: $3,200 balance, $9,000 total available credit. I can't find my interest rate on my app but I believe it's 16.99%.

personalfinance,"Investment Pro Tip: Stay the Course (or, how's your risk tolerance now?)","Based on the number of posts in the last few days about declining portfolios, it seems that a lot of our new members in /r/personalfinance are finally getting a taste of real stock market volatility.  

Today the market firmly entered correction territory.  Things like this simply happen every once in a while.  Getting caught up in the hysteria is what separates good investors from bad.

A list of things you *should* do on days like these include:

* **Review your asset allocation.**  If a 5% drop in the value of your portfolio has you shaking, imagine what a 2008-like bear market (-40 to -60%, give or take) will do for your nerves.  

* **Ignore the noise.** You can bet that roiling financial markets will absolutely explode on TV and certain corners of the interweb.  Ignore the doom and gloom to the extent you can.  You should give approximately zero shits about China's Yuan devaluation, Grexits, Alphabet/Google, Federal Reserve rate increases, China slowdowns, or any other headlines that may or may not have major financial implications.

* **Rebalance from bonds to stocks** if you haven't in a while.  The past couple months' performance means that you may be off your target asset allocation by a significant amount, depending on your method of rebalancing and triggers for doing so.

* **Keep things in perspective.** If you're investing correctly, either your time horizon is long or your asset allocation is one you're comfortable with.  If you're young, even large market swings probably aren't going to matter that much when it comes time to retire (and this doesn't even count as a large market swing, yet).  If you're older, your investments should be more conservative in the first place and hopefully you aren't as worried.

* **Turn your worrying into something positive.** Instead of worrying about your investments, turn your fear into motivation for something positive, like improving your job performance (decreasing the likelihood of being laid off if things get *really* bad), reviewing your finances, or stocking your emergency fund.  [Focus on what you can control](http://redd.it/2a2zn1).

**Remember**, it is human to be averse to losing money, even if your losses are on paper.  Smart investors *keep* those losses on paper.  

""Staying the course"" is probably the most difficult aspect of successful investing.  Use the market's recent performance as a barometer for how you'll perform in a true crisis, and make the necessary adjustments before it's too late.",finance,1440197160
investing,"You lost 3% in your portfolio today, let’s take a deep breath and talk about it","**An atmosphere of fear has set into equity markets** that hasn’t been seen in some time. If you turn on MSNBC you will get host after host at least calling a market correction and some calling a doomsday. If you are watching your portfolio by the hour you might even be feeling the slow onset of nausea as you realize how much you’ve just lost by not timing the market. (You shouldn’t try to time the market by the way.) It’s important in times like these to take a step back and think rationally about the market before we let our emotions drive our investment decisions.

So what happened? The Fed wants to raise rates, Greece just became a problem again, manufacturing is down in China, commodities are hitting new lows with the oil supply glut leading the way, all of a sudden television isn’t the medium of choice for Americans (but neither is Netflix?) the Koreans want to kill each other, they’ve always wanted kill each other but now they might just go for it, everyone thought China would start buying our stuff in never-before-seen quantities, now we are realizing the emperor has no clothes and China isn’t so spectacular.

**Let’s talk about China:** If you’ve been following the advice of people here or anywhere else you probably bought apple, and you probably held apple after it hit $133. Now we are finding (or we already knew) that a major component of Apple’s valuation was the expectation of future sales to China. This is not just affecting Apple though, go look at Celenese for instance, or most of consumer and manufacturing sectors of the S&amp;P 500. We trade a lot with the Chinese and some have overestimated their ability to buy our stuff. What’s wrong with China? For starters China does not actually have a functioning free market, so get any illusion out of your mind that they have the same legal structures that promote the incentives of private actors to make money like we have here in the U.S. The Chinese market does not even allow shorting. If you have been reading the news coming out of China they say they are aggressively pursuing the prosecution of short sellers… what’s wrong here? They do not have short sellers, but they do have sellers. Lots of them. And they want to stop them from selling their own equity positions. China may not have a free market, but they still have free market forces, and they can fight all they want to make certain economic truths untrue, but as Herbert Stein said: “what cannot go on forever will eventually stop” So what is going to stop? Over the past Year and a half we have seen the Chinese stock market expand by 250% and Earnings fell 3% this last year on average. All the while the Chinese state run media basically pulled an extended pump and dump propaganda extravaganza to prop up their market (they don’t actually believe in dumps though.) The credit expansion of asset backed securities in China helped facilitate this bubble (in simple terms the typical Chinese investor mortgaged their homes and placed that same money in the stock market.) Now the new symbol of the Chinese economy is a lonely man selling his prized Lama in the street so he can just hold on to his house. 

**Let’s talk about the European Union:** Investors are waiting for Greece or another poor EU country to back out or fight the EU on their debts. If you ever read Michael Lewis's [article on Greece](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/10/greeks-bearing-bonds-201010) or his book Boomerang you know that the health of most major banks in the EU depends on these smaller countries to act as conduits as the ECB and IMF send money through them to the banking system. Before 2008 many large financial institutions in Europe took major positions in Third World EU debt (that’s a joke.) But more Seriously Greece has created a contagion, the idea of a default is becoming more intriguing to the masses of young unemployed citizens in Greece Spain and Portugal. Meanwhile the Germans still feel guilty for WWII and want to pay the world back by creating entitlement waste in other countries. Think about it this way: if I borrowed $5,000 from Warren Buffet he would own me, but if I borrowed 50 Billion from Warren Buffet, and suddenly I couldn’t pay him back, I would now own him. Ladies and Gentlemen Greece has an economy the size of greater Los Angeles and 1.2 Trillion Euros in Debt (and this is a conservative estimate.) They will not pay this back in the long run, they cannot afford to. They struggle to collect taxes. They cannot contain corruption within their own government. The EU is an unsustainable ticking time bomb, Greece is just the tip of the iceberg.

**Let’s talk about the Federal Reserve:** and right off the bat can we recognize that the Fed is out of ammo? They cannot stimulate the market anymore. We have seen some of the most aggressive multiple expansion in the history of the United States equity markets since 2008, spurred by Fed Policy and now they want to raise rates and take it all back? They essentially cut the Weighted Average Cost of Capital to new lows for our entire economy, making nearly every positive Internal Rate of Return project for every company positive on a Net Present Value basis as well. We just suspended our creative, volatile, constructive capitalism and made the majority of our businesses winners over the last seven years and what now? There are no consequences for this at all? That project to revamp and expand the HR department of your typical mid-size company will no longer be NPV positive as the WACC could retroactively increase in an environment of rising interest rates. Don’t discount the importance of the term structure of corporate debt. The tide is about to go out and you will see who is still wearing a swimsuit and who is swimming bare ass naked. 
So where do we go from here?

I’m going to guess that the majority of r/investing is near my age (mid-twenties or mid-thirties) and we want a stock market crash, we should welcome it. We are not investing for returns tomorrow, we are investing for returns 20-30 years from now, and the greater losses now the greater gains we will have in our 401k’s our IRA’s and even for you trust fund babies too. Look, some of us have been waiting for a cheap asset class to appear for half a decade, now it looks like every asset class is about to get cheap. I want to buy the S&amp;P 500 at a deep discount over the next few years of my life and you should too.

**Let’s put some things in perspective as well,** investing in the United States is like bowling with bumpers, you are going to hit some pins and get a decent score. China on the other hand is a gutter ball. We are fortunate to live in one of the most diverse (by industry) and free markets in the world. Not only that, earnings are actually still growing, despite the global contagion of artificial interest rates, currency manipulation by China, and on and on. Our economy has an advantage because we have embraced a fantastic combination of capitalism and oversight that has created the most prosperous country in history ( save for Monaco but they cheated) and we should welcome cheaper goods from China, $40 dollar oil is going to be great for my morning commute, and let’s welcome the flight to safety as foreign investors will continue to look to the United States as a safe haven for capital. In the long run it’s going to be okay, because 30 years is a long time and this market uncertainty creates buying opportunities. There is blood in the water and you’re a shark, go find something to eat.

**What buying opportunities should we look for now?** There are specific strategies that create downside protection as the near term investment outlook becomes uncertain. Some believe gold will be a good hedge, and at some points in the past it has been, it might work, I would rather hold some other stuff but that’s a difference of opinion. Even better, take a look at VIX, not that proshares bullshit that’s easy to buy and a great way to lose all your money. Go look at VIX: the CBOE basket of implied volatility for options, and then go look at some time series return data for VIX over the past 10 years. Vix by definition works as a hedge for market uncertainty because it is a reflection of implied volatility, and it is a great way to smooth out returns over the long run. If market uncertainty makes your stomach turn, wait for things to calm down again and then go hedge yourself with a portion of your portfolio in a rolling basket of VIX call options, if you want to know more about how this works feel free to PM me. Dividend stocks are a great place to find safety, value stocks are a great place to find safety as well. Look towards emerging markets for some safety as well (think Chile.) Multiple expansion has been relatively limited in some emerging markets and will allow you to find good deals now while things remain tentative here in the United States.

**And most importantly, it’s just money, there are so many problems that money can’t fix so let’s be thankful it’s just 3% and stay focused on a rational investment strategy moving forward.**

**edit:** Wow I did not expect this to blow up. I went out to grab drinks with my Fiance and all of a sudden this happened.. First off I must say that I truly appreciate the comments both positive and constructive and I appreciate the messages (I got A TON of messages.) If you are looking for market predictions... I am not your guy. This is an explanation of market sentiment as I perceive it to be, not what happens on Monday when the market opens, don't ask me what to do with your money this is the internet. This could be a market correction, or we could see a rebound, and I am not trying to predict the future. I just found it all so fascinating I had to word vomit my thoughts.

**Secondly** Monaco is a nation the size of my back yard (that a joke) and has made a business of being the tax haven of Europe (seriously) so the wealth/capita ratio is absurd. I was there just weeks ago and saw the most ridiculous yacht club I have ever seen (I am not a rich man) so I just had to throw in a reference. Guys if you get the chance go see Monaco, and go to the aquarium... it is amazing!

**Finally** Yes Chile exports 25% of GDP to China according to Wikipedia (nice one!) That doesn't mean supply and demand disappeared on 8/21/2015, so if China loses 30% of their value in equity markets that 25% didn't just evaporate into thin air... also you can find specific positions in ADR's or positions in foreign accounts that are fairly or conservatively valued with little exposure to China in Chile or other emerging markets. We are all sensitive to the low interest rate environment and how it has propped up equity valuations here in the U.S... Could you just consider for a moment that emerging markets have a different exposure to other macroeconomic risks and aren't as sensitive to the 10 year T-bill rate? it is not a perfect hedge, and you aren't a perfect investor either, so do your research and get off my ass

**Edit #2: VIX options** I am getting a lot of messages with specific questions about Vix. So let me explain what I do, and maybe you will like it or do something similar. What I meant by rolling VIX options is set aside a certain amount of implied volatility that you want to hold, lets say 6%. There are 6 maturities for these options, 1 month 2 month, 3 month etc. I pick the 6 months, I like the maturity at a later date because I don't get crushed as much by holding every day. So over 6 Months I put 1% of my portfolio into 6 Month call options until a day like today and I sell ALL of it. Then I start rolling money back into VIX options when it falls to the $12-$13 dollar range. I haven't always done this, and I won't always do this, I think the environment today calls for some sort of hedge against these macro economic risks I talked about.",finance,1440197712

personalfinance,This month I fought one of the most reviled credit card companies in the country and WON.,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Hello PF,

Anyway, 10 years ago I was a young twenty something and certified financial idiot but long story short, I ended signing up for a First Premier card in 2006 and it ended up as a charge off in 2012.

I started getting my financial wits around the same time. I had started understanding credit card interest rates and the importance of financial freedom. I became sick of ignoring collection letters and calls.

At that point I had no idea how bad FP was and soon realized that they were a predatory lender. I did everything in my power to get rid of them and put them in my past. I did my best to come up with the funds to settle the account (I settled). PS: This was eons before I found reddit and personal finance. I was sort of a lone wolf driven by the pure urge to get my finances in order. I did any and all research I could (this is how I found reddit &amp; PF eventually).

Anyway after almost three years of disputes (coming back verified) with the credit bureaus, to rid myself of this horrible monster called First Premier, I finally had a breakthrough this year. I wrote them a notice of dispute together with supporting documents showing my clear and concise points of inaccuracies.

I finally received a letter that made me JUMP WITH JOY, I FELT TEARS WELL UP IN MY EYES. [This](http://i.imgur.com/K2emN1J.png?1) letter was culmination of all the years of hard work and perseverance that I put to get my life in order. 

All in all I went from a credit score of high 500's in Q4 2014 to low 700's as of today. 

I paid off my credit card debt, starting in 2013 and having it all paid off by end of 2014.

I just wanted to share this with the rest of the people out here that are in the same situation that I was in. YOU CAN DO IT! It takes strong will and discipline but never give up.

Thank you for reading this, This is such intimate information and I needed to share my joy with someone.

personalfinance,"Need some advice on loan repayment prioritization, please","Dear /r/personalfinance,

I have recently found a job but, prior to this job, I racked up a bit of debt through both student loans deferment and a credit card. Now that I have the ability to make regular payments, I wanted to know which debts I should prioritize when repaying these loans.

Here are my accounts payable:

* **Credit Card** - Outstanding balance of $3546.27 with an APR of 25.99% and a minimum payment (varies month-to-month) of $117.00.
* **Student Loan A** - Outstanding balance of $3303.94 with an interest rate of 10% and a fixed minimum payment of $50.
* **Student Loan B** - this account has multiple loans included in it, but no minimum payment yet as the deferment on it just ended. Loans are as follows: $8757.54 with 6.8% IR, $2548.85 with 6.8% IR, $5501.02 with 3.4% IR, $5594.29 with 3.4% IR, $2390.59 with 6.8% IR, $2054.21 with 3.86% IR. That adds up to $26846.50 at an average interest rate of 5.18%.
* **Student Loan C** - Also just recently came off deferment, so no minimum payments are scheduled yet. Outstanding balance of $7609.36 with an IR of 6.8%.

After reading over the debt Wiki, I understand that I need to make the minimum payments each month. But beyond that I'm a bit confused - I assume that I should pay off the accounts with the highest average interest rate first? I'm not sure how to judge between APR and interest rate. I plan on keeping a sufficient amount of money saved for any emergencies. I want to use the rest of my paychecks each week to pay off these loans as quickly and efficiently as possible.

personalfinance,"Learning PF concepts, got embarrassingly turned down for my first CC.","Hi PF,

Short background- I grew up in a very poor family and never really had a financial education. I made a way though, and am doing well for myself just a few years out of college.  I'm working on improving my financial knowledge now.

I recently found out that my credit score is pretty poor, 645.  I figured I might as well get a credit card to improve this, even though I’m not a credit card type of person (If I want something, I just buy it instead of having a credit card middle-man).

I looked at a bunch of different cards, and because of the type of things that I buy and the travel that I do, a Delta AMEX made a great amount of sense.  The free checked bag would pay for the card fees in a month or two for me, so the insurance and bonus miles perks were icing on the cake.  So, I applied for the card, and they said they couldn’t determine whether or not I could be approved.  So, I sent in work/pay information, bank statements, tax records, etc.  A month later, I called them to ask how things are going, as I’m planning a significant vacation and would love to use the card for the trip.

I was declined *immediately* over the phone. It's like they had made the decision when I applied, but were just waiting for me to call and ask what was going on.  The customer service employee was really condescending and practically scoffed at me for attempting to get the card.  I was pretty embarrassed, and yet still a little confused.  I know that 645 is not an awesome credit score, but I also provided additional information showing that I make 130k a year, have 70k in savings, own my 5 year old car outright (paid cash), and have 8 school loans that totaled 35k that I’ve paid in full with no missed payments.  I’ve never made a late payment on any bill ever, and I’ve been renting $1,200-$2,000/mo for the last 5 years without incident.  There are no derogatory marks on my credit report.

After the hard credit check from AMEX (for 24 points!), my credit score is limping along at 621, and I’m cautious about what to do next.  I’d like to get a card that’s useful for me, but I know chain-applying for cards can look pretty bad. I know I can get a really basic secure card from my bank, but I’d like one that at least has some useful perks, if possible (Like Amazon, maybe).

I went from making $17/hr with tons of overtime at $25.50/hr and paid for benefits to being unemployed from August-November 2014, and then from November 2014-July 2016 I was underemployed. I worked as a cashier at a grocery store part time for a few months and a call center making $11/hr for four months. 

I have not been a good manager of my finances. While I was making good money I didn't save any of it, when I left my job I cashed out my 401(k), took the tax penalty on the money and spent that as well assuming that it would be easy to find an equally good paying job in Colorado and I could always save that money back up later. I didn't even save enough money to pay for our moving expenses and put those on credit cards. While I was unemployed and underemployed I continued to spend money like I made $17/hr when I made significantly less. I've tried really hard not to think about my finances lately because they stress me out but I finally got a somewhat more decently paying job ($26,000/yr salary + good commission potential, no benefits what-so-ever) and it's in the financial services industry so I figure it's my responsibility to have my own shit in order before I start telling other people what to do with their assets and how to protect them.

Net Worth: -$20070.69
FICO Score: 662

My bring home income right now is around $1750/mo for just my base salary. Currently my monthly expenses are around $835.00 not including groceries and gas, I am an avid cook and have no problem cooking cheaply and I work two miles from home so gas is not too big of an expense. I feel pretty confident that I can put at least $600 towards debt/savings with just my base salary, not including any commissions I make. 

Today, I found out that my car needs $1800 worth of expenses. I've been driving it with expired Texas tags since March and need to re-title/register it in Colorado ($300ish), and the mechanic said I need new struts, an alignment job, and front brake pads and rotors for a total of $1500 worth of mechanical work. 

On the day I decided to get serious about my finances, my phone also completely shattered and the cell phone company said it would be a $200 deductible to fix it. I cannot cancel my plan or I owe the full value of an iPhone 6 along with my termination fees.

So.. as you can see, I've financially manged to screw myself in the period of a year. I am looking for advice as to how you guys would proceed from here.

Bitcoin,A future-proofed BIP 100,"**Motivation**

BIP 100 proposes a limit determined by super-majority miner vote, up to a maximum explicit limit of 32 MB. Specifically, the preferred block size limit of a miner is expressed in the Coinbase transaction, and the minimum block size limit value of the middle 60 percent of the values of the last 12,000 blocks becomes the new limit, with a maximum change of 2x in either direction.

The original draft of BIP 100 did not contain the explicit 32 MB limit, but this restriction was added due to concern about the potential for the mining network to decide to increase the limit to levels detrimental to network decentralization.

While eliminating one risk, the addition of the 32 MB limit introduced a new one: a future hard fork to raise the 32 MB limit. As has been witnessed over the last year in the debate over replacing the 1 MB limit, hard forks that deal with the block size limit are highly contentious, due to their far-reaching consequences. This contention makes such hard forks risky, as it increases the risk of a hard fork without full consensus occurring, which would carry with it a significant risk of Bitcoin splitting into two distinct and non-interoperable networks and blockchains.

The Bitcoin userbase and development community will undoubtedly be significantly larger, with more diversity of views, and less cohesion amongst the various stakeholders in the Bitcoin economy, when conditions require executing a hard fork to raise the 32 MB limit, and therefore the risks associated with the hard fork will likely be much greater than the already considerable risks associated with the hard fork to replace the static 1 MB limit.

For these reasons, it would be preferable to modify BIP 100 to remove the explicit 32 MB limit, and find an alternate means of mitigating the risks to network decentralization from allowing miner preference to set the block size limit.


**Proposal**

The proposed solution is to create a predefined schedule of growing upper and lower bounds for the block size limit value, within which miner preference determines the exact value using the same mechanism as proposed in BIP 100, but which cannot be escaped through miner vote.


**Specifications**

Two variations of the bounded solution are offered, a 'simple bounded hash power mediated limit', and an 'enhanced bounded hashpower mediated limit'.

Simple bounded hash power mediated limit (SBHML):

The 'minimum block size limit' increases by 10 percent a year, and the 'maximum block size limit' increases by 40 percent a year, for 30 years. After 30 years, the minimum block size limit increases by 0 percent a year, and the maximum block size limit is increased by 30 percent a year.

Enhanced bounded hash power mediated limit (EBHML):

At every block, a base block size limit, B, is calculated from the central moving average of the block size limit 262500 blocks (approx 5 years) in the past, with the mean calculated from the 52,500 blocks on each side of the central block, plus the central block.

The minimum block size limit of a given block is 1.61051 (10 percent annual growth for five years) times B, for 30 years.

The maximum block size limit of a given block is 5.37824 (40 percent annual growth for five years) times B, for 30 years.

The annual growth factor changes to 0 and 30 percent, for the minimum and maximum block size limit, respectively, after 30 years.


**Comparison between EBHML and SBHML**

At the cost of greater complexity, the EBHML proposal reduces the range of possible block size limit values over nearer-term time-scales, thus increasing the predictability of the block size limit, and reducing, in proportion to how near-term the time frame, the maximum size of swings in the block size limit.

The difference between the minimum and maximum block size limit, and by extension, the maximum potential size of the swings in the miner defined block size limit, grows with time in the SBHML proposal, increasing the risks posed by irresponsible stewardship of the block size limit by the mining majority, while the EBHML lacks this negative quality.

EBHML is therefore recommended over SBHML.


**Rationale**

By having an automatically increasing upper and lower bound for the block size limit, the risk that BIP 100 contains that another hard fork will be needed in the future to accommodate the need for larger blocks is significantly reduced. The dynamic limit also provides the same function as the explicit 32 MB limit in the BIP 100 proposal, in limiting the potential damage done to decentralization from the mining network choosing a too-high limit.

The choice of 10 and 40 percent per year growth for the minimum and maximum block size limit, respectively, for the first 30 years is premised on projected minimum and maximum growth in broadband cost-performance. These figures are reduced to 0 and 30 percent per year after 30 years because of the assumed likelihood of investments in broadband growth eventually seeing diminishing returns as low hanging fruit for cost-performance gains become increasingly scarce.",cryptocurrency,1440231993

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to remember what led to the 2007 banking crisis which ultimately turned into a Global financial crisis. The recovery of the stock exchange in 2009 from historic lows, was effected by intervention of central banks providing unlimited backstops and liquidity guarantees as well as transferring all that toxic debt onto its own balance sheet.

While this injected trillions of dollars, this money remained on the Feds balance sheet paying banks ~2% for the deposit that was loaned at 0%.

This money never reached the real economy and the growth of the stock exchange is Central bank fueled and not organic growth.

It is now time to raise interest rates because in theory the economy has recovered.

I am looking for advice and options on what to do with this excess cash as it currently only makes .15% interest in my savings account. I was thinking about opening a Navy Federal CU account to take advantage of their services down the line.

I would prefer to have access to the money as needed but don't anticipate needing the money soon. Should I be looking at CDs, Money Market savings accounts, High Interest savings accounts, I Bonds, other?

Thanks!",finance,1440242530
personalfinance,Advice on how to support myself with a part time job (UK),"Hi All

This is my first post to Reddit so please forgive any slip ups or mistakes! 

I recently finished my Master's degree in England and, on the urging of my parents, have returned home to Northern Ireland in order to take a break and search for jobs without having to worry so much about financial constraints whilst I'm unemployed. Sounds like the perfect plan, but I'm miserable.

The problem is that I've always been a very independant person, and I haven't actually lived in my family home since I turned 18 and started university. Living with my parents now seems like a huge step backwards and I'm struggling to cope, particularly as I turn 25 next month - a time when most people have their lives sorted and their career paths marked out. Although my parents are really wonderful people and very supportive of my career path (I study ecology and conservation science), I'm just not comfortable living at home anymore. 

My main priority right now is to return to England and find a place to rent near my old university, where I can hopefully get some work experience volunteering with wildlife groups and local charities while I continue hunting for an ecology-related career. I also have a part-time job waiting for me there in a local restaurant, where I can earn just under £200 a week.

My question to this subreddit therefore, is whether I can justify moving out of my parents house and back to England with only a part-time job to support myself. I also have the added expense of a car to keep running (necessary for my job and for potential job interviews) as well as the travel expenses of returning to England via ferry. Although financially it seems to be a terrible decision, I think it might be a good step for my personal well being, and I'm really impatient to become self sufficient and able to support myself without my parents financial support.

Has anyone here had any similar experiences, or any advice they can give me?


TL:DR - Fed up of living at home and wanting to return to my old university town, can I support myself on just under £200 a week?",finance,1440248091

personalfinance,I did something really dumb...please help me figure out how to fix this,"I currently feel like I'm drowning.

I took out a private student loan in 2008 from Chase.  I started paying it back after I graduated a couple years ago.  Several months ago I got a new job that I love but which unfortunately came with a pay cut, but with the promise of a raise after several months of hard work.

 It became harder to keep up with all of my bills in the meantime.  One month, I couldn't afford to pay all of my private student loan bill, so I paid a partial payment.  The following month I did nothing. Now I realize how dumb this is, but it was so easy for me to just....ignore the debt. I figured in a couple months I would just pay all of what I owed and get myself back in good standing when I could afford to.  But then Chase sent me a letter that they were selling my loan to a different servicer.

I didn't think much of that. My federal student loans have changed hands several times over the past few years. Anyway, I got confused because the new company sent me a bill for the past due amount as well as my monthly payment, and then apparently Chase sent me a letter via a collections company also for the past due amount.  At this piint the past due amount was about $215.  I knew I should call and figure out who I actually needed to pay the past due amount to - but here is where I got really dumb.  I decided to just ignore all of it. For three months.

This month I finally decided I really needed to get my shit together. The last letter from the new servicer said I owed $450 past due as well as my $85 monthly payment by August 15. I called them yesterday and they informed me that they charged off my account and sent it back to Chase for collections.

How do I fix this? I cried like a baby because I know my already bad credit is really going to take a nosedive now. On top of that I'm afraid of what the consequences of having an amount this large in collections will mean for my finances in general. 

Please, if anyone knows where I should begin, or what I should do, I'd appreciate it.  Part of me wants to flee the country to escape this mess I've made, but I'm done avoiding my problems.",finance,1440250712

I have been considering trying to take out a payday loan but wanted some information first. Firstly I'd like to explain the when, what, and why. I will be paying my rent on September 4th. I just got paid this past Thursday but I am already almost out of money on account of other things I had to pay and a car issue. So I will not have enough money to pay my rent with my next check that comes in on the 4th. 

I was going to try and borrow $200 from them, and pay it back on the 18th of the same month (I only have a couple bills going out that pay period). I heard they have high interest rates so I was wondering how much I would end up paying back (ball park figure if they all vary)? And i was wondering if I was pretty much guaranteed to get a loan if I go there or if it's some sort of process. I would be able to provide my pay stubs and all of that.

I reeeeaaalllllllyyyyy do not want to do it, but I don't think there is another option. I don't have anyone I can borrow from. My only other option would be to ask the apartment complex if I could owe them $150 until the next time I get paid but I seriously doubt they'd go for that.",finance,1440258079

I'm doing a home equity refinance that will give me about $22k to pay off the student loan debt.   
  
Essentially, I'm just moving some debt from 7.9% to 4.5%.  
  
My question is, **does it make more sense to apply the 22k to one of the loans and virtually pay it off?**  
  
Or **should I split the 22k in half and pay the two loan down considerably?**  
  
As far as I can tell the math works out the same, but I feel like there are other things at play here that I'm not understanding and that's why I am asking for your collective brilliance to help me figure out the best way to go.

politics,What is Proportional Representation? Why America should consider using PR for electing the House of Representatives.,"What is Proportional Representation? 
By: Trevor Woolley

Imagine you and your neighbors plan a block party. Although intended to be an effort of everyone in the neighborhood, we all know some people are more into party planning than others so, as would be expected, your neighbor Jana naturally takes charge. Everyone is pretty fine with the idea of Jana running things because, unlike Jana, you all have other things to do this month than plan the party. 

There are some things, however, that you and your neighbors would like to have a say in. In particular, the music choice. For the most part, you all get along fine. Even though Bill had a hard time convincing the HOA to let him paint his house purple, everyone respects each other’s decisions. However, when it comes to music, you all have such varying tastes that not everyone can agree to pick one genre. 

The cowboys on the south side of the street seem pretty ubiquitous in their love for country music while the gangsters up the street want rap. The retirees will only settle for big band jazz while their grandkids want pop. The hipsters on the far side have a more indie taste, the wealthier parts want to rock on, and the new kids on the block want to pump up the regaton. Despite their sometimes loathly differences, Jana tells them they have to choose one. 

So they take a vote. Thirty percent for country, fifteen percent for rap, five percent for big band, twenty percent for pop, ten each for indie, rock, and regaton. Country wins! So for the entire deration of the block party, country plays. Thirty percent of the neighbors love it, twenty percent are fine with it, and fifty percent hate it. Realizing that the likelihood of the lesser genres getting chosen next year is close to zero, for the following party, the smaller genres joined the bigger ones. The big band folks joined country listeners thinking it was at least better than rap and the gangsters joined the pop scene thinking pop was at least better than country.  In this neighborhood there is always one winner and many losers. 

But, what if instead of basing the decision on this all-or-nothing method, Jana decided that each genre would be allocated a portion of playing time at the party according to the percentage of votes it received. In this case, instead of country music playing the whole party, it would only play 30 percent of the time and likewise pop would play 20 percent of the time and so on for all genres. This way, each of the neighbors can be proportionally satisfied. 

In the political arena, America is a perfect real-life example of the first music choice method: winner takes all. In this well-known and primitive system, the only goal is to get more votes than your opponent and “voila!” you won the race. In the House of Representatives for instance, each seat is determined by using the winner-take-all system over a given congressional district. This inevitably leads to wasted votes, gerrymandering, and two parties from which we are told we need choose the lesser of two evils. Is this winner-take-all system really the most representative electoral option available or was it simply the only option democratic proponents in the enlightenment where comfortable implementing considering British Parliament was their only contemporary example?

We all have felt underrepresented in our government as of late. Luckily, we don’t need to be stuck listening to country music at the party the entire evening! (No hard feelings to my country friends by the way.) A better way has been paved: proportional representation. The goal of proportional representation is to do exactly what its name suggests: to proportionally represent. In doing so, it minimizes wasted votes, eliminates gerrymandering, and allows for more representative options from which to choose. 

What are wasted votes? 

In America, we normally think of wasted votes as votes for a third party candidate such as for Bob Dole who is commonly given the blame for “stealing votes” from Al Gore. It was often said at the time that 
“A vote for Bob is a vote for Bush.” In reality, given our winner-take-all system at every level of government, any vote beyond the necessary plurality is a vote that was entirely unnecessarily cast. Your high school teachers who told you “Every vote counts” was nothing less than lying to you (albeit probably unknowingly). 

In America’s electoral system, a candidate who wins 90 percent of her constituents’ votes wins nothing more than the candidate who wins 51 percent. So, in a race with only two candidates, not only did everyone who voted for the loser waste gas money on their trip to the voting booth but so did everyone who voted for the winner after the 50 percent plus one-th person did. Sorry for sounding pessimistic but, as adults it’s time we face it: with over 350 million people in America and given our current electoral system, our votes don’t sway elections even 1/350 millionths. In addition, after every single competitive election, 50 percent of the constituency is unhappy and unrepresented. 

Wasted votes can perhaps most easily be observed by Republicans in California and Democrats in Utah. California is home to 39 million people and 18 million registered voters. Of those voters, in 2012 30 percent were registered as Republican. So naturally, California has generally voted for Democrats. However, 30 percent of 18 million is still roughly 6 million unhappy and unrepresented people. Thirty of our fifty states have less citizens than the number of Republicans in California without a voice in their government. Some may like or dislike this unfair advantage but no one can deny the obvious lack of representation. With a system of proportional representation, hardly a vote is put to waste. Even the losers still get represented by someone. 

What is Gerrymandering?

Gerrymandering is just another one of those “necessary evils” we’re told to put up with. Representation in the U.S. is organized by geographical areas. Few Americans are even aware where these boundaries are drawn, especially because they are so frequently redrawn. If one was to actually look at these congressional district boundaries, he would immediately notice that they are not drawn into pretty square shapes of equal size. This is of course partly because they are defined based on population but, unsurprisingly, also because they are defined to benefit the party of the contemporary district designers. 

Gerrymandering is the drawing of district boundaries with the intention of limiting the chances of the opposing party to win. Even if the general population of a state is nearly 50/50 Republican/Democrat, gerrymandering making it possible for either party to win a majority of seats simply by dividing the enemy to conquer. There is no dispute that this indeed happens. Yes, even in the land of the free, the winners of the game are still its designers.

In proportional representation, gerrymandering is entirely non-existent! Using the U.S. House of Representatives again as an example, instead of holding individual district elections for each seat, a nationwide election could be held. If 45 percent of votes are Republican, 40 percent of the seats go to Republicans. If 45 percent are for Democrats, likewise Democrats would get 45 percent of seats. Similarly, if Libertarians gain 10 percent of the vote, 10 percent of the seats go to Libertarians. If 5 percent go to the Green Party, the same would be allocated. Maximized utility and minimized waste.

The purpose of geographical districts has historically been to represent each community’s special interests in the national arena. This sounds reasonable. However, the benefits of such geographically small representation prove few and far between. Muted by the other 434 national constituencies, local concerns are negligible and are instead best represented and handled on the local/state level. Geographical representation, therefore, is more adequately provided for by the Senate. 

Additionally, the fruits of geographical special interests have been proven mainly to be undeserved subsidies to certain industries. The cost of gerrymandering on the other hand is the wasted votes of all people who unluckily happen to live in an area that was drawn to benefit the people of their opposing party. 

More than two parties?

A winner-take-all system inevitably breads two major parties (Duverger’s Law). Sure, other parties are allowed to exist, but really no other parties matter except the two largest. Some may argue that “ideally” we don’t need parties. That there could just be people running for office. George Washington himself warned of the destructive effects of parties. What happened? By the third U.S. presidential election, like-minded people formed the Federalist Party and people who disagreed with them formed the Republican Party. 

Parties are an inescapable part of modern democracy and they actually play a very useful role for the citizenry in modern politics. Any country without parties today is essentially a single party government. Usually not much diversity there and hence not much representation either. Clearly parties are necessary, but do we have to have two? Is running a country really that black and white, yes or no? Does everyone in America really fall into two categories? Unfortunately, in America we may have actually tricked ourselves into thinking so. 

The role of a party is to collectively represent a group of citizens with similar ideas on the direction a country should head. These citizens can either ascribe themselves to one of the existing parties or form their own ideological band of nonconformists. If enough people agree, it becomes a party that can seek political influence. 

This bottom-up function of parties is inevitably killed in the winner-take-all system. For another real party to rise up, one of two things must occur. Either (1) a mass enlightenment happens where suddenly members from at least half of each party leave the two established parties to form their own. Or (2) one party manages to win over almost 100 percent of the vote and by next election party splits over some issue. Each of these has happened once in America’s history and both within 40 years of each other (1824 and 1860). Since the Civil War, America has kept the same institutionalized parties though hot topics have changed quite a bit since then. 

In a proportional system, multiple parties can peacefully exist in the same congress. The only requirement in getting a perfectly suited representative for your beliefs in the national legislature is if said believers can muster enough votes to merit a seat in the House. Yes, that means that even people you really disagree with get a little representation. If only one percent of America prescribes to the Crazy People’s Party of Conspiracy then only one percent of congress represents the Crazy People’s Party of Conspiracy. A proportional government is about accurately reflecting the general beliefs of its constituents and not just saying anything to win over different demographics. The demographics will speak for themselves.

No need to fear the little extremist parties, however. A majority vote is still required for any bill to pass into law. The only difference is that if a party does not have more than 50 percent of the House, other parties would need to be on board with the bill—a much more bottom-up check on our legislature. In America’s current system, each and every issue that one party supports, the opposing party has to be against. This is because, as we all know, whatever the other party says must of course be stupid and wrong. With proportional representation, bills would pass issue by issue. If a certain decision is actually better than another, it will pass. If a bill is dumb, it won’t pass because, if it turns out to be a flop, the people won’t give as many seats to the dummies. 

In addition, spending more money to beat the other guy does not matter as much in a proportional system. Instead what really matters is earning citizens’ trust instead of their wallets. Currently in America, the source of the majority of donors for national level candidates is big business and the very very wealthy. “Well, they have money to spend,” one might say. But proportionally, ten bucks from an average Joe is equivalent to a hundred bucks from wealthy Whitney who makes ten times more than average Joe. Why then do Joes not pay candidates as frequently as Whitneys or big companies do? Because a hundred dollars is a little more persuasive than ten and campaigns need money.

Proportional systems are much less dependent on money spending and, as a consequence, are less inclined to pass special interest legislation intended to subsidize specific industries. This check on crony corruption is a much needed change. After all, neither the business owner nor the politician is to blame that the ability to corrupt government is so easily accessible. A winner-take-all system essentially requires such behavior. Reason implies that a government intended to represent its people should probably represent the individuals’ concerns equally; not just the few who can pay for it.

How does it work?

Today most industrialized countries use proportional representation. Twenty one of the twenty eight countries in Europe use it and the United States herself has implemented a proportional system in almost every government she has recently helped rebuild. Though implementation of proportional representation varies in specifics from country to country, all forms of it are centered on party election. 

For national representation, citizens across the country vote for a party. The seats in Congress are then filled proportionally by party according to the percent of citizens that voted for each party. The only wasted votes would be those that were cast for a party not big enough to merit any seat. Politicians to fill each seat are normally set in an order predetermined by the party through priority vote in party primaries.

From its founding, the goal of the American experiment has been to form a more perfect system of governance. Proportional representation is the next step toward fulfilling the hopes of our forefathers. With such a huge population, highly educated populous, and widely diverse ideals, now more than ever America is in need of representation reform. The American colonists fought the Revolutionary War itself over improper representation in their country’s parliament. Considering many more Americans are unrepresented today than those who lived in the American colonies during the Revolutionary War, do we have any less reason to demand representation than they? 


NOTE: Considering the purpose of the House of Representatives is to represent the United States citizenry as a whole, proportional representation would serve as the most effective system to achieve said goal. Because the Senate’s goal is to represent the states’ interests individually and President’s role is to represent the nation’s interests as one individual, a different electoral system (priority vote) would more accurately select suitable candidates for such positions. While PR is best for electing a group to represent a group, priority vote (instant-runoff) is best for choosing one representative to represent a group.",energy,1440262393

Ok, so, I read through all those colorful information buttons on the right and the FAQ's and whatnot, and I still have a question because all of these options seem like good ones and I'm not a very good decision maker when it comes to money.
 
I have a lot of student debt. I have in total $118,904 to pay the bank. This is split between 3 loans. 
 
* I've got $79,500 in a private loan at 6%
 
* $8,000 govt subsidised at 3.4%
 
* and  $31,404 govt unsubsidized at 6.4%. 
 
 
The two government loans are in limbo until December when my grace period from grad school ends. The private loan was for undergrad and I have been paying just over the minimum $500 since last December. I'm paying the private loan as much as possible from my paycheck.
 
 
Now, on the side, I do freelance web design work. I didn't have much time for it the past few years, but I just started again and have been saving that money. I've got $5,000 now and I want to do a lump sum payment of it to one of the loans. Now I know the priority should go by interest rate, so the unsubsidized government loans *should* be my priority, but hear me out. 
 
* If I wait another month or two, I could pay off the subsidised $8,000 in one payment and have one less student loan on my list. 
 
* On the other hand though, if I put the lump sum right now towards the unsubsidized 30k, according to [this](http://www.regions.com/Insights/Personal/Debt-Calculators/how-to-pay-off-debt-fast-using-a-lump-sum-payment) calculator, ""By making a lump sum payment, you will repay your loan 92 months earlier and save $ 13,385 in interest charges over the remaining term of the loan."" (For this calculation I put in 200 a month)
 
* The third option is give it to the private loan, which really just feels like trying to empty a pool with a spoon while it's raining, but according to the same calculator I'll finish, ""44 months earlier and save $ 16,880"".

personalfinance,"Past college is holding on to my transcript for $7,000+","So here's the story.  I attended Drexel University from Fall 2010 to the end of the Spring term in 2011 (September to June) and took on a hefty private loan in order to do so.  Coming up on the second year, I could not afford to do so again and made the choice to withdraw from the university.  Drexel has a policy that if you withdraw within the first two weeks, no costs will be incurred to you.  I attempted to do this, but my application was processed late and they put a hold on my account.  Last year, I worked with a representative at Drexel for half a year to try and have the hold on my account disputed, as I never attended class or was on campus at all for the first two weeks.  Unfortunately, I receive an email in December of 2014 telling me that my dispute has been denied.  Below is part of the email correspondence between me and said rep:


""With that being said, I have been feverishly working on your account dispute. The problem with your dispute is that you were not officially withdrawn/dropped from the 201115 fall term until the third (3) week of the term. When a student is withdrawn/dropped in the third week the student is held responsible for 50% of the terms charges. You received federal aid which disbursed to your student account and paid 50% of your charges for the 201115 fall term.
 
I know your position is that you never attended a class or participated in courses for Co-Op during the term in question, because you were having trouble securing sufficient funding to attend. Because the withdrawal/drop was originally approved for the third week of the term and aid was disbursed to your student account to help cover the charges for the 201115 term, the financial aid office cannot retroactively return said aid to the federal government (because of the time that has lapsed). I am currently awaiting a call from someone in the financial aid department to discuss this matter in detail.
 
I have also shared your previous email with the SCDC Office since they are aware of your attempts to withdrawal from the 201115 term.""  - 5 December 2014

""Thanks for your email inquiry!
 
Please take a moment to review the email chain I have attached to this email. Your request for a retro-active drop of the 201115 has been denied. I advise that you set up a payment plan if paying your student account balance in full is not an option at this time.
 
Please feel free to contact me to discuss setting up a “Past Due Payment Plan” (PDPP) with “Tuition Management Systems” (TMS). TMS is a service the University contracts with to help manage the past due payment plans.
 
Be advised the dispute hold status will be removed from your student account which means your student account will begin being assessed the 1% late fee charge beginning this month on or around 12/15/2014 – 12/17/2014."" - 16 December 2014

I've tried researching to learn how mortgages work and everything, and I've learned a lot considering I went in with a blank slate, but determining the best options in this situation is proving difficult. I read the sidebar information on mortgages too, but I'm not sure it made anything much clearer.

My dad is turning 60 and has been working in the oilfield for twenty years. He makes good money now, but recently he was hit with a curveball. His income relies on his health, but with the looming threat of insulin dependence and a new diagnosis of heart disease he's feeling the squeeze. I'm working hard on keeping his health maintained, as well as working on his finances. I know this should have been taken care of long before now, but he didn't come to me until recently and you can't force somebody to let you help.

I've used unbury.me to begin a plan of attack on his fairly minimal credit card debt that is estimated to be paid off in less than two years, maybe less if the budget allows for a larger amount available to pay.

When I moved back home as a teenager in 2008 my dad immediately went out to buy a house. At the time he took the best deal available to him.

I don't have much information on the original loan but it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $57k, in 2008.

I just logged into the bank's page to pull the information, because I'm not sure what is needed:

Fixed Rate Mortgage

* Monthly Payment   $753.00
* Current Principal Balance	$51,925.94
* Current Interest Rate   6.625%
* Current Principal and Interest Payment   $380.99
* Escrow Balance:	$2,063.53
* Interest Year-to-Date:	$2,021.07

I'm not entirely certain that's enough information, but I'll get what I can. 

The payments have been steadily increasing over time, from what I gather it's due to escrow shortage which looks like it's $680.92. Right *now* it's affordable, but in the long run I'm not entirely confident it will be forever, on top of the fact that basically nothing has been paid on the principal.

$753 payment breakdown:

* P&amp;I $380.99
* Escrow $315.27
* Shortage $56.74

personalfinance,2015 US Income Tax Planning: Maximizing donations for 1040 vs AMT taxes,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I have a question about maximizing my charitable deductions here in the USA. I decided to do some late-year tax planning for 2015. I calculated a draft 1040 and AMT tax, by estimate the income, taxes, and deductions I will pay for the rest of 2015.

The tax calculated on my 1040 (e.g. $17,000) was higher than my tentative minimum AMT tax (e.g. $10,000). I will estimate paying about $14,000 in federal withholding taxes for 2015.

I have some favorite charities that I want to donate to, and it's not the US Government! I want to maximize the donations so that I'm not paying more in taxes than I have to.

Does it make sense to donate $3,000 to a qualified non-profit? This should bring my 1040-calculated tax owed to $14,000 - which matches the taxes already witheld, which means I won't have to pay taxes or get a refund (I think?).

Or, does it make sense to donate $7,000 and potentially get a $4,000 refund?

I'm 28 yr (F), single, no kids, zero balance on credit cards and with $200K worth of student loans from professional school. Interest wise, I have $100 K on 6.8% and $100K on 8% Currently I'm enrolled in PAVE, I'm paying nothing per month this year. I started a job that after taxes &amp; ""benefits"" my salary is $65K with out making a contribution to the 401 K. My employer offers 8% match for my 401K. That being said, if I max out my 401K, the employer is giving me $7000 as a match. That would be $14K/yr in a 401K. I currently have an HSA with employer as well. 

Should I work hard and pay off the student loans? I was planning to pay 800-1000/month extra on top of the regular 10 yr payment schedule. I would like put more money in the one with the higher interest rate.  This could pay off my loans in 6-8 yrs and save me a lot of interest. If I do this, it will be very hard to max out the 401K and have savings. After rent ($900) I would have $600 to cover the other expenses (utilities, insurance, food, gas, ect)  

Or continue on the PAVE, max out the 401K and have 8 months worth of my income in a savings account? It will take me 6 yrs to do the emergency fund. Doing this, my debt will never be paid and 20 yrs down the road I might see a nasty IRS surprise.

I'm so mad I don't even know what to do.","TL;DR: eBay basically facilitated theft, worked with paypal to muscle money out of me, and then paypal charged a fee for their ""service."" $140 sale turned into zero dollars, lost product, and $25 lost for services that cannot be recouped. Sorry for the following wall.
-
Recently, I sold a tablet on eBay for 130$ (+$10 for shipping). All was going well, the buyer paid quickly through paypal, and I headed on down to the US post office to ship the thing.

Their default flat rate boxes ship with $50 of insurance, which I guess covers damage or loss. Sweet. I shouldn't need it, but it's good to know I have it. This is where my problem started.

The person opens a refund claim on eBay, stating that there was some damage on the tablet that he suspects was incurred during shipping, and that he'd like a $20 refund for the damage. Well, I didn't damage it! I tell him to take/send me some pictures so that we can go talk to the post office about getting some money back. They should be able to give us twenty bucks, since it's their policy.

The case escalates to eBay support, as the buyer has completely ceased all contact. I tell them that the product should be insured for damage, and they immediately closed the case in his favor. He received a full refund (FROM MY BANK ACCOUNT), and he gets to keep the tablet. Their reason? ""You said it was insured, case closed.""

The buyer hasn't had to prove a single thing, show evidence of damage, or even speak with eBay since he purchased the item. Here's where the split screwed me: after refunding him $140 from my account, PAYPAL KEPT THEIR FEE. So I'm irreparably out of 10 bucks shipping, another 10 bucks that they refunded for shipping that came from my pocket, 5 bucks of paypal fees, the tablet, and the $130 It sold for. I literally lost $25 *and* the product to make it back with, because the two companies now have no obligation to work with each other.

I'm considering taking one (or both) of the companies to small claims court if that's even possible. I just need someone to tell me, do I have any real recourse? Every time I've called the appeals number, some low level call center person tells me ""well, those are the rules!"" I'm beyond fed up.

I imagine that this is basically like me walking into a walmart, seeing that a used item has a scratch on it, and saying ""that's damaged, it's mine now!"" and the courts saying to walmart ""yeah, he's right, and we'll keep 25 bucks since you were gonna sell it.""

personalfinance,"For student loans, how concerned should I be about variable interest rates?","So I'm a senior in college and was doing some estimating about future student loan payments. 

So i was using SoFi as an example with their rate ranges i did some math.
Worst case scenario i graduate with $34,200 in private student loan debt. 

On 10 year loans:
Variable Rates: 2.69-4.565%
So for Me...
Monthly Payment: $325-$354
Total of Payments: $40.0k-$42.6k

Fixed Rates: 4.615-6.5%
Monthly Payment: $355-$388
Total of Payments: $42.7k-$46.6k

My Thoughts:
So it appears to be that variable rate loans will be about $30/month cheeper. 

Is that enough to justify the potential risk of the rate going up? I have no real experience in potential market changes so i dont know high/low the risk is.

personalfinance,"Started budget, can't decide whether to keep going as-is, consolidate credit cards, refinance car, or what.","Hello everyone.  


25 year old PF lurker, and I've finally hit a snag in my attempt to get my debts/budget under control. I currently have all of my accounts linked to a Mint.com account to track spending, and it's shown how careless I have been with my money the past few months. Please note that I had a roommate (girlfriend) when the lease was signed, but we broke up and she moved out (hence the massive rent payment).


I'll start with fairly detailed monthly costs, credit score (estimates), and then follow up with my questions.


Incomes-  
Veterans Disability: $587.36  
Last 4 paychecks (varies due to work load, paid every other week)-  
08/12: $1153.25  
07/29: $1408.13  
07/15: $1241.04  
07/01: $1544.46  
Calculated average monthly income (using last 6 months of data): $3120.76 (every 4 weeks)


Monthly Expenses - (Monthly payment (~ denotes fluctuating))  
Rent: $805  
Insurance: $105  
Utilities: ~$140 (this is electricity only, water/trash included in rent)  
Internet (Netlix/Hulu lumped in): $65  


Debts/Loans - (Total owed / minimum payment / interest rate)  
Car: $5679.75 / $455 / 3.65%    
Credit card 1: $10652.87 / $266 / 13.90% (Prime + 10.65%) [Not sure if my total APR is 13.90, or 24.55%]   
Credit card 2: $1514.11 / $66 / 25.24%   


Credit Scores (Supposedly):  
Kredit Karma: 619 TransUnion / 611 Equifax  
Mint: 636 (Equifax I think)  
USAA: 661 Experian  


Only the expenses listed are important. My parents pay for quite a bit of my food, whether it be at a restaurant or their house. They have a savings/inheritance account for me over $10k, so I am not looking at making a savings until debt is gone.


Now, I have been pondering the possibility of how to tackle this the best way. I have already cut out a lot of my spending at bars and going out, but my in house costs have gone up as a result (groceries/electricity), so I don't see much change there.  
1) I have been considering doing debt consolidation for the two credit cards, but I don't see much value to that since the smaller card can be paid off then snowballed into the bigger card.  
2) My car only has 15 months left on the loan, but I was considering refinancing for two years to drop the monthly payments on that, and toss the difference into the credit card payments.  


Really, I am wondering what would be the most efficient way to go about paying these 3 massive debts off with the lowest interest paid, and as quickly as possible, so I can get my budget more stable. Should I consolidate the cards, and refinance my car, snowball only, or maintain current course?

personalfinance,"Navient is playing hardball and I cannot pay off $130,000 in debt","I've posted about my situation in the studentloandefaulters subreddit, but I found my way to this section just trying to find information about student debt in general.

A little about me: I was coerced into college twice, one of which was an Art Institute (not one of the branches that closed either) and, after all was said and done, had about $128K in debt when I finally graduated. My balance with interest has ballooned to a little over $130,000 since 2013 and in spite of repayment since that time. In June of this year, I realized that the leftover grad school loan money that I was using to pay Navient was running out pretty quickly and decided to try and start negotiating a lower monthly payment with Navient. My federal loans were already in IBR and since I had no income, I was paying nothing toward them. However, I was expected to pay $488 a month on just my private loans.

So far, Navient has not budged on anything. I've sent them goodwill letters (all sent certified) just telling them I can't afford to pay standard amounts anymore and asked what my options for a lower monthly payment might be, and also requested mail-only contact. I said I did not want to do interest-only payments because that is not beneficial to me long-term when I would like to pay toward the balance, so of course they offer me... interest-only payments, which would be a whopping $120 decrease. Not a big help when one's income is 0. I requested debt validation in June to make sure all the promissory notes and contracts were signed by me and not a computer and they said they sent it, but I didn't get it. I live two hours away from Navient's Wilkes-Barre branch - it doesn't take two months to send me stuff.

I admit I have pretty much no monthly expenses because I have no choice but to live at home. Kinda hard to afford things like rent and food when nobody will hire me for anything. I recently got hired for a very part-time aide job at a school, but even with the impressive hourly pay, I work too few hours to make a decent amount of money. Navient keeps telling me they want me to fill out this financial information sheet to determine if I qualify for a lower monthly payment (monthly expenses, checking account contents, food bill, etc.), but I'm concerned that they'll see my bank assets and refuse. I have two checking accounts (one is just for Navient transactions) that have about $800 between them and a CD that contains about $7000 from a small inheritance. The CD also kind of doubles as my savings and I refuse to touch it unless there is a genuine OMG emergency. I'm concerned that if I tell Navient this money exists, they'll reject my request for a lower payment and/or try to take the money without consent. They do have the account number on the Navient-only checking account, but that's it.

And I know the immediate response is going to be ""find another job."" I'm working on it. I've been working on it since 2010. Not too many people want to hire someone with two art degrees and almost no real work experience. But I want to reduce my payments now to something I can afford while being able to save up to buy a used car. 

I've told Navient that I will inform them if/when I can afford to make a higher payment, but they are not interested in working with me and prefer to just skirt around all my questions and requests. My mother also cosigned some of the private loans and Navient is hounding her now, and she's being a pain in my ass because she doesn't want me to make lower, more affordable payments. Because I guess defaulting is better than giving the impression that I'm poor? My mother has always been one of those ""I'm poor, but I'll act like I'm not so nobody thinks I'm poor"" kinds of people.

At this point, I am very sick of Navient's shit. I'm sick of them not working with me and not listening to me. I want very much to pay off this debt like a good citizen and become an independent and debt-free adult, but they're making it impossible. I'm not sure how to handle them anymore. Also, they have reminded me that they are somehow exempt from the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and, therefore, don't need to do a damn thing I ask of them.

What else can I do to work out a lower payment? I've had a lot of people suggest that I not fill out the financial info sheet because Navient will use it against me if I have more than two dollars to my name. I'm considering no longer asking them for assistance and straight-up telling them, ""Here's how it's gonna be: this is what I can afford to pay each month, take it or leave it."" If they're going to be stingy bitches, I may have to be one right back. My options, as far as I can tell, include:

- Intentional default
- Settlement
- Good faith payments that I can afford
- Death

In spite of my opinion of my school and of Navient, I am still willing to pay on these loans. But how the hell do I get them to meet me in the middle?",finance,1440361746

Though I do pretty well here ($55k, 12% tax rate, don't have to pay US taxes, lower cost of living), I haven't been great the past year I've been here about socking away cash or paying down debt. 

I did buy a car for $3.5k that I saved up for when I got here and paid for in cash.

I have about $6.5k in credit card debt, that I paid down from $11k when I got here.

I am here for another ten months on my contract, and I am realizing the urgency of building a nest egg before I return to the US, since I will have a lot of expenses when I get back (deposit on an apartment, possibly a car, possibly supporting myself without a job in my field for a couple of months). 

All of my student loans are federal, and I just consolidated them recently because my understanding is that if you want the loan forgiveness for doing public interest work, they have to be consolidated through this program.

Right now, my job is in an area that qualifies for loan forgiveness after making 120 payments. I intend on staying in this field when I return to the US, too. 

My loan payments right now are set at about $550 on an income-based repayment plan. 

This past month, I threw $1200 at the credit card and put $500 in savings. It was sustainable, and I think I can actually put aside a little more- maybe $2k total for the month, especially if I enter into a deferral/forbearance on the student loan payments. 

My question is, should I get a deferal/forbearance on the student loan in order to put more money toward the credit card/savings? Part of my thinking is that the student loan is not going to go away in the  next year- it is going to take me ten years to chip away at this thing at all, and that extra $500 a month socked away could really give me a lot of peace of mind when I get back to the states. On the other hand, the sooner I make 120 payments, the sooner I can get this burden off my back (well, most of this burden- about $50k of my loans don't qualify for the forgiveness).

personalfinance,"Saving for a house. Pay off student loans first, save for down-payment, or mixture of both?","Hello All,
Thanks in advance for your input. So my current situation is my girlfriend and I both recently graduated from college and live at her parent's house rent free and have no bills (trust me, it's not as great as it seems). I'm an auditor making 55k and she's a teacher making 46k. Our main goal is to have a 20% DP for a house (~60k) within the next two years but the sooner the better. While she has no loans, I graduated with a fairly decent amount.  
  
Sallie Mae/Navient  
-$1,985 9.876% Fixed  
-$3,555 5.575% Variable  
-$4,425 3.25% Variable  
Total= $9,965

-Federal Perkins Loan $6,000  
-Ford Fed Direct Sub Loan $13,466  
-Ford Fed Direct Unsub Loan $7,816  
Total= $27,282  
  
Our house fund currently has $9,500 which I have been putting around 2k in every month and my girlfriend will be contributing about the same from next month on. So the my question is whether I should cut my savings towards the house and pay off all the Sallie Mae loans ASAP, or pay a little over the minimum and focus more towards the house, or pay an equal amount to all the loans and the house fund?

investing,Do not Panic - why Value Investors (today's pessimist) should not worry about speculators (today's optimist),"Today’s optimist sees nothing but growth today-and-tomorrow.  The optimist sees growth today through an increase in opportunities in stock.  Over the past six years, those who have invested into nearly any stock have seen growth in their portfolios at an exceptional pace.  Those who invested into Victoria’s Secret (LB) at $6.26 on March 6, 2009, for example, would have netted a 1,198.56 percent gain today (August 19, 2015) at $81.27.  In addition to believing that growth is occurring today, the optimist believes that growth will occur tomorrow.  By spending six years in growth, the bullish investor is forgetting the events of 2007 and 2008, ones which led to collapse of stock price.  Without past memories, the amnesiac bullish investor will willingly invest into any trendy company so long as the price of the company continues to increase.  There is no need to time the market since the market will continue to rise in price. 
	
The optimist will believe the growth will last forever due to the fiscal policy of the Federal Reserve.  In contrast to decades prior, when the 1970’s brought a time of high interest rates, today’s interest rates are next-to-nothing.  With cheap money beckons cheap gains.   Those who have easier access to money have easier access to stocks that takes advantage of the cheap money.  Today’s climate has seen record amounts of mergers-and-acquisitions through cheap debt.  Charter Communications, a debt-laden cable company, has acquired Time Warner Cable through cheap funds. No doubt, the optimist that seeks easy money will love easy gains. 
	
Optimists invest almost exclusively into securities.  The only land that allows for significant growth above interest rates comes from stocks.  The lack of inflation, the Federal Reserve preferring stocks over bonds, and belief that prosperity will prevent default, have all caused bond yields to shrink to record lows.  Yields in European countries now include negative percentages.  In other words, those who invest into Switzerland bonds, for example, will lose money once they pull out their money.   The optimist, therefore, has established a permanent resident in the city of Stocks. 

The optimistic speculator of today will brag to his or her colleagues of his or her portfolio. In said portfolio contains a variety of securities trading at lofty P/E ratios.  Be it Facebook, Netflix, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Under Armor, and/or Amazon, today’s speculator looks for the securities equivalent of Kate Upton, the “it girl.”
	
Meanwhile, today’s pessimist is worried about the current affairs of the market.  The pessimist realizes that the growth of gains will not last forever.  In fact, based on historical events, it would appear as if growth will slow down in the upcoming years.  Those who invest today will not experience the same gains exhibited by the optimists from two years prior; nor would today’s pessimistic investor want to invest into today’s market either. When a company such as Facebook has a higher valuation than Proctor &amp; Gamble, when Netflix has a higher valuation than CBS Corporation,  history shows that irrational exuberance will eventually catch up to irrational investors. 

Much of today’s money used to purchase stocks comes from cheap money, funds made cheaper by the lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve over the same six years.  In a world of balance, the raising of the interest rate will lower stock prices; and in this same world, those who made gains today will lose them tomorrow.   

The pessimist is concerned about bond yields.  In a world where risk today is the same as risk five years previous, yields in both corporate and Government have decreased significantly.  One disturbing indication of the lowered bond yields involves a world where Solar City bonds have a return similar to American bonds.    
	
The value investor looks for stocks that are hated by the mass market.  Said investor metaphorically drives around at midnight without any headlights to guide him or her towards a certain value security.  Rather, it is instinct and logic that allows the value driver to traverse towards the destination.  While the collective market believes that Nathan’s, Michael Kors, Lumber Liquidators, Micron Technology, and oil stocks will end in burning flames, the value investor sees these stocks as paradise. 
	
Tomorrow brings the opposite for both today’s optimist and pessimist.  When tomorrow comes, the roles will be reversed. Whereas today’s optimist is full of joy, tomorrows will be full of sorrow.  While today’s pessimist holds back, tomorrows will push forward. 
	
Tomorrow’s pessimist will look in their portfolio and notice that many of their stocks that they held yesterday have been corrected towards a fairer value.   History shows this as fact.  The Yahoo of 1999 that closed at $108.17 closed at $4.34 in 2001. The investor who paid $2,073.76 in 2000 for AIG watched as their stock declined to $7 in 2009. Likewise, the investor who paid $69 for Twitter in 2014 is now seeing the stock at $27.60. Contrary to popular belief, timing the market is everything.  Those who invested into Microsoft at its’ peak in 1999 has lost 6.57 percent of their original value in 2015, despite years of steady growth and value investing principals. 
	
Tomorrow’s pessimist will lament over the easiness of receiving funds during the peak of the market from a lowered interest rate.  Tomorrow’s pessimist will lament in the same way that they lamented in 2008 when they invested into bank stocks that collapsed due to the nature of their investments from cheap interest rates.  Tomorrow’s pessimist will also lament over investing into heavily leveraged companies that, now held to accountability, collapse under their weight.  AT&amp;T in 1999 bought TCI Communications from John Malone in a heavily leveraged deal in order to establish telecommunications supremacy.  The problem was that the funds came from cheap means through a lowered interest rate.  Once accountability was set forth, AT&amp;T discovered that they were unable to combat their debt, eventually becoming insolvent with massive short-term debt. 
	
The pessimist of tomorrow will weep as their returns on former popular stocks plummet.  The former optimist will have held onto their stocks under the notion that the speculative companies will have recovered in price. This will prove not to be the case as in a market correction, formerly overvalued stocks will become more efficient via matching the price with value; and while the stocks of yesterday were high in price in contrast to its’ value, the price today would be low in comparison to its’ value.   Some of tomorrow’s pessimist will escape to bonds under the idea that price fluctuations in securities will affect bonds.  However, the speculator will realize that not only have yields collapsed due to the actions of the speculator, but many companies involved in the bond market collapsed due to a burgeoning of debt.   
In contrast to tomorrow’s pessimist, tomorrow’s optimist will be hopeful of the future. While the price of a stock during tomorrow’s market may be significantly lower than in the years prior, the value of many stocks has increased.  More risk arbitrage opportunities open up for the optimist.  Over a six-and-a-half year period, the stock of Dillard’s increased 1,815.11 percent .   While the stock had tremendous value – even in the market correction of the late-2000’s, the stock decreased in price simply because nearly every other stock did. The optimist of 2008 may have invested into the stock when the pessimist was selling; and in the process, may prove to increase their long-term income.  
The optimist of tomorrow will welcome the actions of the federal  reserve in increasing interest rates.  As interest rates rise, the stock price decreases.   As the interest rate rises, securities are held to accountability more compared to when the interest rates were down.  The optimist of tomorrow buys securities tomorrow in the same vein that a young female might buy bras-and-panties at a Victoria’s Secret semi-annual sale. 
	
Bonds, convertibles, and preferred securities,  will become prevalent for optimists of tomorrow.  Companies that the investor knows have the capability of surviving yet are considered by tomorrow’s pessimist as in dire straits is a company that, while higher in yield, will be beneficiary to the opportunistic investor.  It is this reason that Warren Buffett was able to invest heavily into Goldman Sachs, General Electric, and Harley Davidson, companies whose fixed-income yields greatly surpassed the yields of yesterday’s optimist. 

Today’s pessimist has nothing to worry about in terms of today’s market.  It is true that the pessimist of today has little-to-no-returns to show for in comparison to the optimist of today.  However, once the snowball effect takes place in a bursting market, the pessimist will convert into an optimist, having been given numerous opportunities to use risk arbitrage.  Meanwhile, the optimist of tomorrow must not interfere in the actions of today’s optimist. As Luke 9:60 said, “Jesus said to him ‘let the dead bury their own dead.’”",finance,1440420265
personalfinance,[Student Loan] Variable Interest Rate vs. Fixed Interest Rate,"To give a little background I have two (about to be three) student loans for the amounts of $21,000, $8,000, and now $2,000 (the last student loan I will ever be taking out!). The first two loans are variable interest rate with an interest payment (paying off the interest while I'm in school and paying off the rest once I graduate).

I have the option to do either variable interest rate or fixed interest rate and within each of those do either a repayment option of interest payment, fixed payment, or deferred payment. I don't plan on doing the deferred payment option since it costs more in the long run and I can afford to make payments on a loan right now. The variable interest rate option starts off at a lower interest rate but can vary greatly (one of my loans is currently at 11.63%).

My question is: should I go for a variable interest rate or a fixed interest rate and within that should I go for an interest payment or a fixed payment? Keeping in mind that within 1 year time, I should be able to pay off the loan completely.",finance,1440420794

I'm 23 and have had several different checking accounts over the years (mostly trying to find one with a savings system and overdraft policy that I liked). Like many people my age, I've found myself at the bottom of my paycheck and still with bills to pay and overdrawn my account.

On two separate occasions, I let it get a little out of hand. With one bank, I altogether forgot to close the account, it overdrew, and then I proceeded to ignore the mail they were sending me (thinking it was ""come back! we miss you!"") until a collection agency contacted me about $68 in overdraft. I quickly paid it, and my account was then closed with that bank.

The second bank had a policy of $30 overdraft fees. Now this didn't mean $30 dollars if you went negative, and then every charge after that was declined...it meant $30 when your account went negative, then every transaction was declined after that, but your account was still charged an additional $30 when a transaction was declined.

Needless to say, I very quickly left that bank...but of course I somehow ended up owing them $141 in overdraft. Now a collection agency has contacted me, and I will pay them next paycheck.

But here's the real issue: recently my reliable car has started to not be so reliable...I need to get a newer one very soon, and so my step-father suggested I take a loan. Having a great relationship with the businesses in the area, he knows the best banks with the best rates for auto loans, and (of course) he suggested the two banks I've owed money to.

My question is can I still ask these banks for an auto loan? Obviously I'll pay the collection on the second bank...but I'm almost afraid to walk in to either like they're gonna say ""Uh, no sir...you've been deemed unreliable since you couldn't pay a simple overdraft fee...we can't offer you a loan."" and I'm going to be stuck paying some high interest rate.

personalfinance,Seeking advice consolidating student loans (x-posted from /r/personalfinancing),"Hello All,

I'll try to make this short, I've got over 100K in student loans with three vendors (Navient [Sallie Mae], OSLA, and ACS). The average interest rate of all of my loans is ~5.11%.  I've been paying about $1100/mo for a number of years and it just doesn't feel like it's going down. 

I've got excellent credit (around 780) so I applied for a loan at meetearnest.com and I was approved for a loan to consolidate all of my loans but now I have to choose my APR; I'm given a choice of a fixed rate of 5.86% or a variable rate (starting) at 3.80%. The variable is based on LIBOR (I have no idea what this means or if it's a good thing) and can go up to 8.95%.

I'll basically be paying this loan off in 9-10 years with these current rates, but the variable bit scares me a bit. I am able to switch between variable and fixed every 6 months, but they obviously cannot guarantee the same rates.

Any advice would be helpful. I really am just tired of not seeing any progress with my loans when  I send a payment in, not to mention paying three vendors.

personalfinance,Yet another student loan debt post -- $184k,"I decided it's time to stop lurking and finally ask for advice specific to my situation. I was under the impression that there was little I could do about my loans until I graduated, but it seems I was a victim of misinformation. Don't get me wrong though -- I know I screwed up. If I could go back and do it all over, I would go to community college right off the bat -- but there are no do overs, so I need your help, personalfinance, to make the best call moving forward.

I have private loans that make up the bulk of my student loan debt. I took out these loans my first couple of years of college -- my mom made too much for me to get much in financial aid, and neither of my parents were willing to cosign for a loan (my mom did cosign for one my first year*, but that was it.) All of my loans are serviced by Navient. These are my private loans, all with variable interest rates.



Loan| Balance | Interest Rate | 
---|---|----|----
1 | $42,007.46 | 9.25% | 
2 | $52,628.33 | 9.75% |
3 | $20,082.46 | 3.25% |
4 | $16,485.86 | 7.25%*|
Total | **$131,204.11** |


After that second loan, I had to drop out -- I couldn't get another private loan, I had no cosigner, and I owed my school $2000 for classes I had already taken. So I worked service industry jobs, just barely making ends meet, until I had the money to pay back my school so I could at least get my transcripts. I went back to school in 2011 part-time. I have completed my associate's degree, and will be done with my bachelor's in Paralegal Studies in May 2016. I'll be 30 years old by then.

I am currently making $35k a year, my take home pay is just over $2100 a month. I am currently paying around $1400 in expenses, including rent, utilities, cell phone and internet. I do not have a car payment, just insurance, registration, gas, maintenance. I have no savings. At this point in time, I can try to squeeze out enough to make small payments on my student loan, but it's impossible for me to make the full payments. I am trying to find a way to cut back on our monthly expenses, which will more likely than not involve moving. My SO and I had planned to move to the Denver area (currently in Chicago) next year when I graduate, but we need to get out of this apartment first (rent is increasing to $1800/month on October 1) in order to set aside some savings.

So, if you made it this far, I have a couple of questions:

1. Two of the above mentioned private loans appear to be in repayment. The website says my deferrment runs out in 16 days -- but I start my last year school this week. ~~Is this something I just need to ask my lender?~~ I called on my lunch break. The private loans can only remain in in-school deferment for a predetermined amount of time. My clock ran out.

2. My federal loans are just under $50k. Should I make these my primary concern, or focus on these high interest rate loans?

3. I won't need to take out any more private loans. Should I see about consolidating them?

4. Aside from cutting back on my living expenses (which I fully plan to do), what else can I do to work towards getting these loans under control before I graduate?

If you need more information, I'd be happy to provide it. Any advice you can offer would be very much appreciated. Thanks for taking out the time to read this.

EDIT: Thanks again everyone for all your help. I called Navient, they're going to work with me to lower the interest rate to 3% on those two high interest loans that are already in repayment. I'm getting ready to make some progress, and my SO is feeling much better now that we're making some progress.

personalfinance,Want to give teenage son best financial advice,"My 18 year old son graduated this year, began his first job and will be starting college in the fall. I'd like to give him the best financial advice I can so that he will start out with a solid foundation to build on. Here is what I have for him so far - please advise if this is good or bad advice, and add to it. 

His situation at the moment - he has approximately $700 in saving. He has about a year of community college to complete an AA degree and he has no student loans; his only costs are books and supplies. (He is an excellent student.) He does plan on going to university following that. At the moment he does not drive, put plans on saving to buy a car with cash. His only expense at the moment is a cell phone. He works part-time, minimum wage with commissions. I believe that his job has an option for a retirement (401K maybe?). His savings account was attached to ours as a child's account, but is now his.  I have thought about suggesting to him the following: 

* Open his own accounts at a credit union or bank of his choosing after he researches his best options, checking interest rates 

* Split his paycheck so that a percentage is going into checking and a percentage is going to savings (please advise the percentages) 

* Obtain a secured credit card (limit $300?) Perhaps use it for his cell phone payment, and then pay it early every month so that he will build good credit

* Take advantage of his work retirement plan? I'm not sure about this. I don't know how long he will be there, since he will be going out of town for uni.  

I am not the most financially savvy person. I've made a lot of mistakes financially that I don't want him to repeat.  I believe that he is aware of that, and is of the same mind - not wanting to repeat my mistakes.

Bitcoin,Why Does Bitcoin Price DROP When China and U.S. Markets Plummet?,"I realize lots of factors affect BTC price, and that the Core/XT Fork Wars are heightening insecurities, but...


When the relatively small Greek economy was in peril in June, price skyrocketed, in part because 3 other relatively small economies (relative to the entire EU, or China, or U.S.) might follow (Portugal, Italy, Spain).  


But when the largest economy in the world sees its currency devalued by historic proportions, and when the U.S. markets respond by the biggest market decline in 7 years, wouldn't one think BTC would surge?  Or go up? Or hold its value?  Or not go down further?


Greece, and Cyprus before it, did not threaten to destabilize the world's economy - or even leave Europe in financial ruin - the way that China and few other countries can.  And of course defaulting on an IMF loan is not the same economic event as stock markets declining.  BUT...the Greek government's bank closures and limits did not wipe out billions in wealth the way the Dow/NYSE drop did since Thursday, when Americans check their retirement accounts and see a 15% decline in 5 days.   And maybe a shift to crypto-currencies is far more gradual - first, people have to sell off stocks or mutual funds, learn about BTC, open an account...


Yet the price increase happened in nearly real-time in June and July when Greece approached default, and was fed almost entirely by BTC purchasers NOT in Greece.   (There was also turmoil in the Chinese economy in late June, but not to this week's degree). 


So I wonder why we're not yet seeing - or if others expect to see - BTC's value jump when two of the world's largest government currencies and centralized markets go into (hopefully temporary) free fall.  In the big picture, Greece, China, and U.S. each saw its government backed fiat, and centralized markets, seriously stumble.  Isn't that precisely what makes Bitcoin so attractive as a currency, and so potentially undervalued in price?   


Even a market correction - assuming the U.S. Stock exchanges are just overvalued, instead of completely linked to China like a breastfeeding baby - should feed a corresponding upwards BTC market correction, no?",cryptocurrency,1440433491

What spurned the recovery...low interest rates?  They were already super low. Improved unemployment? No, that recovery hadn't started, yet.  In fact, it kept getting worse.  Recovered housing market? No, and the outlook was HORRIBLE.  New construction/infrastructure? Please.  

Moral of the story. Stop asking what you should do.  The answer is the same.  Dollar cost average like a boss and prove that you weren't bs'ing everyone when you said, ""I'm in equities because I have a high risk tolerance and I'm buying for the long term."" Anyone telling you to do otherwise is guessing.  We don't know if the market recovers next week, next month, or next year.  What we do know is that studies state time after time that those timing the market LOSE.

personalfinance,My SO put his tuition on a credit card. Help!,"My SO has recently graduated college. He has been in college around 6 years getting his bachelors degree (he switched majors in the middle). But, his parents had him take out a credit card to put his college tuition costs on when he started that his federal loans didn't cover. (I still can't believe they were so stupid)

So. Now my SO has a credit card with a 17k balance on it. At around 12% interest or something. He pays around $170 a month in interest. He didn't understand how credit cards worked and thought the interest was only charged once instead of every month. 

We are planning on getting married in May and I just want to make the best decision possible on what to do with this credit card. I'd rather not start our marriage in crippling credit card debt. His mom called him and told him he needed to get the credit card put in his name and remove her as a cosigner. She can't take one out for his youngest brother who is starting college because she's on both my SO's and my SO's middle brother's card as a cosigner. (still banging my head on the wall)

She said the guy at the bank (oh yeah its a 5th 3rd credit card) said that he can transfer the balance onto a credit card with a 0% interest rate for a year, but obviously we can't pay off this credit card in a year. There's just no way. 

What would be our best option? Should I have him take out a loan to pay off the credit card then he pay back the loan and hopefully a lower interest rate? Would Sallie Mae or an actual Student Loan place work with him maybe to transfer it to them? I just, don't know what to do.",finance,1440435537

Crude prices cratered and the Baltic Dry Index and shipping rates started falling rapidly in the month of August. This was before any carnage was outwardly visible. And then two months later everything cratered.
Ofcourse this time it's different. We've already been through hell and as far as I'm concerned nothing can match that carnage again.

A lot of this nervousness might be because of the eerily similar situation. But make no mistake , we're in for another period of weakness in the global economy from China , slowing shipping , declining crude etc , the stock market however is protected as long as QE is there.

gaming,Marvel VS Capcom 4: Keep the Hype Alive (Concept P1),"Back in the day there used to be a collectibles shop just a few blocks from my high school that I would frequently spend my afternoons at. This place was unique as it not only had toy models and cards but also a row of arcade machines that sat against one of the walls. Out of the various options, there was one machine in particular that caught my eye which I fed countless quarters to during my many visits -- that game was Marvel vs Capcom.

I had never played on an arcade stick before, but after watching the characters move and perform absurd combos and attacks I made it my mission to learn everything I could about the game and get good at it. I picked up a copy for the PS1 and played until MvC2 came out, which I played to death as well. Then a 10 year period passed void of any MvC information or updates until, finally -- what seemed like eternity, MvC3 was announced.

For those who are not familiar, MvC3 was released at the start of 2011 and received a major update (Ultimate) roughly half a year later after the initial release. Even though I played both versions to death and still play Ultimate occasionally, it is agreed upon amongst the fans that the game suffers from bugs, poor online play, not much of a story as promised, character imbalance, and lack of modes.

Fast forward to 2015 and nothing has been improved upon or fixed. So rather than waiting another 10 years for the possibility at a brand new title I decided to take it upon me to stop waiting and visualize what a new installment might potentially look like. For roughly the past year or so I've been working on my spare time to create a basic concept for MvC4 which encompasses an overall product vision. This product vision not only includes in-game UI designs, which I'll share in part 2, but also collateral such as posters, packaging, logo design, and a mobile app.

As far as what I'd like to share in this initial post, you can view some of the collateral here: http://imgur.com/a/7Zgd3

The album includes box art with logo design, how the game would appear on the dash, joystick design, various posters, few character looks by an illustrator friend of mine, and questionnaire results from my time at this years EVO. I also printed a book that holds all assets created for the vision. The few pictured include in-game player emblems, combo counter art, and the ranking system. Lastly, I've included what is meant to be a companion app for the game. Through this app, players can access most recent news such as update information, arrival of new dlc, patch notes, weekly challenges, etc. You can chat with friends and compare stats as well as set up brackets when you get a large group together. It also features a competent combo archive driven by player submissions. Players can search using various filters and add specific combos they like to playlists they've created as well as submit their own combos.

I do not work for Capcom or Marvel and they have no affiliation with me or the designs I've created. This is only meant to be a labor of love from someone who is passionate about design and games and who wants to share with like-minded people. Hope you enjoy!

We can't seem to agree on what's reasonable for our combined income.","I'm a recent college grad and the types of jobs I'm interviewing for pay between $35-40k before taxes (3.55% state, plus whatever federal is, 6.8% if I individually make $37k to $90k), but it's IT so I'll most likely be able to move up within 2-5 years of starting. My girlfriend is likely going to be making $10-11/hr. In this city the average 1BR is between $750-900. Said city is a large metropolitan area full of people between 20 and 35, and I think it would be fun to stay here. Before someone says ""look in a suburb outside the city"", I'm counting the suburbs as part of the aforementioned large metropolitan area, as the city itself is very small. The suburbs are pretty much the same price as the city, and outside the suburbs there's no residential housing whatsoever, mostly government farmland. 

My girlfriend desperately wants to move to a different city (our 'plan B', it's kind of a funky little steel town near where her grandparents live) where the average 1BR is $550-700 because we'd be more likely to afford it, but after doing some research (mostly on Indeed and Glassdoor) I found that her salary would likely be $7-8/hr, and mine would be around $26-30k/yr if I can even find a job (there aren't many computer oriented jobs there at all, and I don't have any other skills so I'm SOL if I can't). 

Oh, and just because I included it for the first city, taxes in City B are a flat 3.07% for the state, and 1.9% for the county, which I've never heard of but apparently that's how they roll. Federal is the same because it's federal.

electronics,Supplying small devices from an HDMI port,"I recently bought an HDMI to VGA adapter to connect a Google Chromecast to my old projector. The adapter draws power from the HDMI port of the Chromecast and this seemed to cause the adapter to reset from time to time and to behave strangely. I assumed this was caused by the Chromecast not supplying enough juice at times. 

I tried to find info about how an HDMI port is expected to supply power but I couldn't find a clear specification of what should be the correct return path for the current it would feed from its 5V pin. 

The most reasonable explanation I came up was that the metallic part of the connector itself should be used. I cut the trace of the 18th pin of a male to male HDMI adapter to separate the 5V supply of the host and the client HDMI devices (not sure if nomenclature is correct) and fed client side going to the HDMI to VGA adapter from the same USB wire that supplies power to the Chromecast. This seems to do the trick. I haven't seen any detailed teardown of the Chromecast but I've used the tester to check and it seems the 5V pin in the HDMI adapter is not simply passed through from the 5V pin in the USB port. It seems to be, perhaps, current limitted. Any thoughts about this?

personalfinance,[Auto] Advice on auto loan refinance. Notification from the bank vs. loan officer -Nevada,"Hello PF,
   I apologize if my title is less than helpful.  First time poster, long time lurker. I've gone through the sidebar for advice and browsed through the ""Auto"" flare to see if this has been touched on before. Please keep all negative comments about my situation to yourself and remain subjective.

  I financed a car in July of 2014 through the Capital One that also included a Bumper- to- Bumper policy. I currently owe just under $14,700 on said vehicle. My B2B policy is for $1,900 and added roughly $40 per month to my payment. I'm currently sitting at a really high interest rate of 19.11%, which at the time was the best I could get for my situation. I've never been late on my payments, have divided and paid twice monthly as per the advice from the Financial Shark at the lot I purchased the car at.
  Recently, my credit union who I bank with sent me a flyer stating that I was pre-approved for an auto loan for $14,980 with a rate of 9.89% APR. Prior to receiving this flyer, I've tried contacting my bank to see the possibility of refinancing since it's been a year. The first time I contacted them in June, they said I should get it down around 13k before trying to refinance as they can't grant me a loan for the amount still owed (at this time, just under 15k). My SO and I chose to look into other options, and during the process  this flyer was sent to me from my Credit Union. 
  I spoke with the loan officer regarding my options, she explained I needed to get my loan under $11,500 for them to refinance. I explained to her that I received a flyer in the mail that said I was pre-approved for a car loan that covered what I currently owe. The flyer clearly states that this is for refinancing the loan I currently have with another institution.The officer explained again that it's based off my credit to get this loan, and that the car information is not calculated in. 
  What I'm wondering, is why would they send me this letter if I'm not qualified? Do I have any options with this as I'd rather be paying less than 10% rather than my current 19%. Would the fact that my loan is currently for 72 months since July 2014 vs. 60 months that the Credit Union is offering make me ineligible? I've asked her about taking out a loan to pay the credit towards Capital One, however she said I wasn't qualified for that either. Is there anything I can do or ask my loan officer to help? I feel like I've met a dead end but there should be more options.

personalfinance,NJCLASS Student Loan Collection Lawsuit,"Back Story:  I borrowed from the NJ Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA) under the NJCLASS program for part of my undergraduate education.  While I was in graduate school, I dropped below full-time enrollment for one semester and the loan came out of deferment.  I made several payments and then attempted to return the loan to a deferred status the next semester when I went back to full-time enrollment.  This was back in 2008-2009 and the NJCLASS folks were uncooperative and I couldn't get my loan payments deferred, nor would they lower the payment so that I could afford it.  Shortly thereafter, the loan was placed into default and I have been making monthly payments to the collection agency since 2011 (an initial lump-sum of $1,500 and $137.00 per month on an automated debit).

Today I received a summons indicating the collection agency is suing me on behalf of the HESAA program for the remaining balance ($13,822.45) plus collection costs/attorney fees ($3,059.29).  

The text of the summons reads ""Defendant failed to make payments as required and the loans are in default.  Plaintiff has demanded payment from the defendant, but the defendant has failed and refused to pay, leaving a principal and interest balance due of $13,822.45"".  

I called to speak with the collection agency today because I have not refused to pay, have been making regular payments according to a payment plan that was established with them.  The representative said the payment plan was only temporary, and now they are requiring full payment.  I asked about increasing the payment amount per month and they will only do that if I agree to pay the entire balance in one year, which I obviously cannot afford to do.  I will face wage garnishment/seizure of property/assets if I don't settle the debt or respond to the lawsuit within 35 days.

I posted under /r/legaladvice regarding my options for the lawsuit (i.e., can I ""win"" since I've been making regular payments for 4 years?) but I want to get some feedback on my options for just paying off this collection agency to get them to drop the suit.  

*My local bank only offers personal loans up to $5,000, which isn't enough.  
*I have a few credit cards but the interest rates are on the high range and I have been working hard to pay them off, so I don't want to go that route.
*I thought of trying to open a new credit card to get some kind of introductory rate, but there's no chance I'd get one with the capacity to pay off the whole loan, and then I'd end up with huge balance at the end of the intro period because I can't pay it off that fast.
*I looked into LendingTree.com and got a few quotes, one of which is for the loan amount + collection/legal fees ($16,800) with a 5-year repayment term at 13.99 % APR and $390.82/month payment.

It appears the Lending Tree thing might be the ""easiest"" option, as it gives me all the capital I need to clear the debt at the collector.  However, I don't know much about personal loans - am I locked into paying the pre-calculated interest with a loan like this, similar to an auto loan?  Or can I save on interest by paying more per month when I can afford it?  Is there another type of loan I should pursue instead of a general personal loan?  Obviously my credit isn't awesome, but I have been slowly making improvements in the last few years.  I'm bummed at the possibility that this issue will send me back to the bottom.

Any other suggestions for how to handle this are greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.",finance,1440462137

I'm on track to have had an income of $98k in 2015. I've already maxed out my IRA and will have my 401k maxed out by the end of the year, both 100% Roth. I'm in the 25% tax bracket so that's 23,500/0.75 = $31,333 pre-tax income that I never really saw. 

My total effective tax rate, including state, local and federal withholding (which is close to what I owe; negligible refund each year), is 32%. That puts my take-home pay at (98,000-31,333)x(1-0.32) = 45,334. From that, about $11,000 goes to mortgage principal and interest, which I will not pay in retirement because I plan on living in a house that I own outright by then. That puts the estimated post-tax income that I will need in retirement at $34,334/year.

Using the 4% rule (assume 6% growth, live off of 4% of the balance allowing for 2% growth to match inflation), that means I'll need 34,344/0.04 = 858,339 in today's dollars to retire. I'm currently 34, and plan on fully retiring 30 years from now. Again assuming 2% inflation that means I'll need 1,554,762 in 2045 to retire. Since the money could grow at 6% annually on average over those 30 years, that means I'd need 270,700 to retire.

personalfinance,"Mountain of Stafford and Parent PLUS loans, possible to reduce total?","Hello all, I've recently (~1yr) married the loveliest women ever, and she has just... just a stupefying amount of student debt.  I'm trying to wrap my head around it and restructure it so it doesn't last until we die.

Here are the details:

4 Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, 6.55%, Current Balance: $19,048

* $2,625, Disp. Nov-06

* $4,500, Disp. Feb-08

* $7,500, Disp. Oct-08

* $7,500, Disp. Oct-09

* Subtotal:  **$22,125**

4 Direct Parent PLUS Loans, 7.9%, Current Balance: $98,300

* $23,565, Disp. Sep-06

* $24,290, Disp. Mar-08

* $21,550, Disp. Feb-09

* $22,850, Disp. Feb-10

* Subtotal:  **$92,255**

Payments began ranging from '07-'10

Initial total:  **$114,380**

Current total:  **$117,349**

Current Monthly Payment:  **$1,066**


They're on graduated repayment plans, increasing every two years. The smaller ones are in her name directly. The larger ones are in her dad's name, but we're paying them.

As you can imagine, the *current* total being higher than the *initial* total is alarming as fuck-all. We currently make about $95,000 annually, have a monthly rent of $1,650 before utilities, and no car loans or credit card debt. We'd like to have kids and save up for a house, but at the rate we're paying back the loans, we're not saving at all. If we increased the payment rate we'd start cutting into savings and it would barely dent the bigger loans.

This whole situation is just crazy. I've looked into some of the different options and it's not clear which one is best, or which ones we're even eligible for. I used studentloan.gov tool [here]( https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action) 
and it talked about some of the [different options](http://i.imgur.com/DTuEGg6.png), but none of the options were great. =/

Are there any ways I can reduce the total? Potentially consolidate some of the loans and make them eligible for IBR, ICR, or PAYE? And, is there a [stone-dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jl4iL6hCqs) ELI5 description for those three things, and how I can get them? Or at least reduce the interest rate, perhaps by consolidating?

personalfinance,I need advice about if I should voice my opinion about my parents' handling of my uncle's estate.,"My family owned a 200 acre farm in Appalachia, split between my dad, aunt, and uncle. The shale gas boom hit and all of a sudden the land was worth a lot of money. My uncle was in declining health and immediately signed his share of the mineral rights to my dad and aunt. My uncle got married, and about a year later passed away. My parents and aunt want to take care of his widow, but she is becoming increasingly manipulative about the whole state of affairs.

Legally, she has no claim to any of the mineral rights, but she did inherit my uncles share of the land. My parents and aunt offered her 10% of the royalty money(which is very substantial), and in exchange she would sign the land/house back over to my dad/aunt.  At first she was okay with this arrangement, but after time she started asking for higher percentages and wanted a flat fee for the land(way above market value). 

For background information, my family plays music together, and my uncle taught me and my brother how to play electric guitar. He was a groovy dude. I passed equipment back and forth with him, he indian gave me a ton of gear but always gave me something a little bit better in return. I almost always borrowed guitars or amps of his, sometimes for years at a time. At the time of his passing, I had one of his guitars. His widow called me about a month after his passing, and said something along the lines of, ""my son Joe just really wants to see that guitar, he forgets what it looks like and he just wants to see it."" I took the hint and took it back to her, but I know without a doubt that he would want that guitar and all of his other music gear back into me and my brothers hands to make it sing again. 

He didn't have a will and I know there's no obligation for her to give it back, but this ties back into the mineral rights because her argument is ""it would be in his wishes that I would get an equal share of the mineral rights,"" yet she is holding ALL of his personal belongings, as well as holding the farm ransom. If she really wanted to go according to his wishes, she would be passing those things along. The ""wishes"" argument goes as far as it is beneficial to her.

And none of this is written down, but I don't think my uncle planned for everything to go to his widow in the first place. I spent the last summer he was alive staying with him on the farm, recording all of his songs and just laughing and having a great time with him. At night we would talk and he talked about giving out the mineral rights money after he died, and how one nephew in particular wouldn't see a cent of it. He never talked numbers, but it was clear he didn't intend for all of it to go to his widow. He didn't have any kids, and he was really close with me and my 4 brothers, so I suspect that he would have given some of it directly to us.

So essentially, what I want to know is if I should voice my opinion to my parents, which is: she's blown the ""it's in his wishes"" argument out the window, and if he could see how she's handling the situation after his passing, he wouldn't want her to have anything. If anything at all, they should buy the land for a high enough price that she could live off of it for the rest of her life. The 10% over the course of the royalty checks amounts to between 4 and 5 million dollars over the next 30-40 years. No one knows exactly how long they will produce, but my dad has received offers in the mail for $20 million dollars cash for his share of the rights. Those companies don't make a profit by giving you money for free. 

TL:DR, My uncle's widow has no legal entitlement to the royalty money, and my parents/aunt are getting fed up with her asking for a higher percentage when they don't have to give her anything.",finance,1440464251

personalfinance,Facing 150k+ student loan debt and I feel as if I may never be able to get out from under it. Any help or advice would be appreciated,"Hi everyone. I have heard great things about this sub and was hoping that you guys/gals could help me.

I graduated from college a few years ago and after finally getting a good full-time job recently, I started to look at my student loans more seriously and realized just how bad they were. I have known for a while that my debt exceed 100k, but in the last few months I've come to understand exactly how bad it is, so here's where I'm at:

I have a total of 5 student loans, 2 federal, and 3 private. The private loans add up to about 65k with an average interest rate of 5.47%, and the federal loans equal about 93k with an average interest rate of 7.53%. My total monthly payments are just under 1,600 and I make 52k a year.

My parents help out a little by paying 200-300 each month, but I pay the brunt of it on my own. On top of that, my mom has a debilitating disease which prevents her from working, and my dad was let-go from his job a few years back and now works somewhat inconsistently making a decent amount, but not much more than my parents need to cover their expenses. I currently live at home with my parents, however they intend to sell the house in the next year or so since it's too big for our family and we can't handle the mortgage much longer. When they sell, I may be forced to find my own place to live, although it's currently too far out to know for sure.

Finally, I try to put about 400-500 in a savings account each month, and I currently have ~5k in savings. 

I'm not sure what advice you guys can give me, but anything would help. I have heard of the waterfall method, and I do try to pay extra on my loans, but Im not always able to. I've also looked into refinancing my loans, and I could probably save about 400 a month by doing that, but I feel very wary of it since I'd be switching to a 20 year term to save that much.

Is there anything I can do to lessen my loans, or improve my situation? Thanks for any help you can provide.",finance,1440466538
investing,"You lost another 3% in your portfolio today, let’s take a deep breath and talk about it","**An atmosphere of fear has continued to set into equity markets** and last time when I told you to be worried I never expected [this kind of response.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3hwo1s/you_lost_3_in_your_portfolio_today_lets_take_a/) It was very humbling and I just wanted to reach out and say thank you r/investing for such a great discussion Friday and Saturday. I also did not expect [this kind of response]( http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5EVIX+Interactive#{""range"":""1d"",""allowChartStacking"":true}) in the market place to what is without question a market correction in China.

**Welcome to one of the most volatile markets of the decade!** This is a rare moment and you should cherish it because we don’t experience days like today very often. Well, try to forget about your portfolio, cherish this moment, and then keep reading. In fact, the Volatility Index hasn’t hit this day time high of 53.29 since the 2008 Financial crisis. So what are we to think of this? We have a growing population, a growing economy, earnings are still growing here in the U.S… I have always taken issue with the way unemployment is measured in the U.S. but it’s still better than it was in the aftermath of 2008. We don’t have a liquidity crisis. We will get to keep our homes this time. Why is everything nominally tearing downwards when our real lives seem just fine? This is something worth talking about. Here are my thoughts:

**The futures curve is not a prediction of future prices.** Say what? That’s right, let me say it again for emphasis: The futures curve is not a prediction of future prices. I don’t care if its corn oil or concentrated orange juice. But this is a common perception of futures curves, and we all woke up to a radical downward shift in futures curves, so what is happening? In academia when calculating the true value of a futures contract there is one variable we use called the *Convenience Yield.* In simple terms, the convenience yield is the implied value of having downside protection in holding a futures contract. If you were able to buy a future today on say (the value of your own portfolio) for $X amount, and sell it a few months later when you were more certain of the economic value of your portfolio (what you could buy with it and sell it for) you would put value to the convenience of downside protection. This is why futures contracts are not future prices, there is value in certainty.

So what am I getting at? Markets are not perfectly efficient. Say what? I am full of surprises today aren’t I? Okay so markets are perfectly efficient, they will adjust entirely to the financial news of today over time, a year from now hindsight will be 20/20, this will be a blip in market movements. But today, do we know what will happen in China? What if the Fed raises rates? What if NK goes to war? Our market is not perfectly incorporating future events because they haven’t happened yet, Volatility, Volume, a spike in the Convenience yield? These are all signs of fear, but it’s not 2008 anymore.

**We are seeing an amazing amount of volume in the market data** There is a lesson to be learned from all of this stuff. When ’08 happened many investors reacted by panic selling, today some are taking profits and buying gold off of Fox news. Look you thought the valuations in equities looked a little high didn’t you, at least agree with me that the Shake Shack valuation was hilariously silly. But why didn’t you pour every dollar into a short position, why didn’t I? Because timing the market wrong can bankrupt a strategy based on timing the market right alone. You might think the Fed created this mess, or China did, or irrational investors did, maybe you were calling the top on Friday, or maybe you were calling the bottom, but it’s easy, so easy to type these words. Our risk tolerances prevent us from bearing the pain of being completely wrong in an all in strategy, this is why we diversify, and hope all trees are growing towards the sky. You will lose most of the time in an all in situation because being right in the short run is nearly impossibly expensive, especially for the Chinaman who borrowed on their homes.
And this party looked so good didn’t it? We all loved the returns in our 401k’s didn’t we? We knew something was coming, but none of us had the balls to try and time it because we would have been wrong for the last 7 years. So we wait and retroactively react.

**So what do you think was happening in China** when people were mortgaging their homes to buy equity positions in ridiculously overvalued Chinese firms? Everyone wanted in on the party as long as it lasted, now everybody wants out because the average Chinese investor doesn’t even understand how valuation works. 

**The problem in markets today is a valuation problem.** We are entirely different from China in that we are still experiencing earnings growth in the United States, things are good here. But we are entirely similar to China in that on a Macro level we behave just as they do, we are all human anyways. No one wants to leave a party until it’s over, and no one wanted to get out of the market until the last 5 days. 
Anybody can take a buy recommendation on a few stocks seriously and get in the market for the last 7 years and then all of a sudden when all this fear arises. People get scared, they think to themselves “what the hell did I just do, why do I even own Baidu and Tesla, it had a buy rating on Yahoo finance?!” But they don’t have their own target price, or their own valuation. Either red looks like a time to stop and get out to the emotional investor or red looks like buying opportunities to disciplined investor and guys the disciplined investor always wins.
*So what do we do now?*

Hey [u/sayitlikeyoumemeit](https://www.reddit.com/user/sayitlikeyoumemeit) is this your time? [Some people are in tears today,]( https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3hwo1s/you_lost_3_in_your_portfolio_today_lets_take_a/cubakh0) what should we do? I have a few ideas. First, you know what the dividend yield in dollar terms in my portfolio was today? The same that it was Friday, and Thursday, and Wednesday. Guys if you want downside protection and upside potential dividend stocks are a place of safety in times of uncertainty. Secondly, remember how I told you about my rolling vix call option portfolio? Well since Vix is up a whopping 45.34% and is at it’s 5 year high I have a proposal for you: Buy Puts. The stock market can have a correction over three months but that won’t create a value for the implied volatility like we have seen today. Buy the right to sell it at $40 for $20.48 on February 17th and just sit on your hands if you’re feeling lucky ;) I don’t see implied volatility going much higher over 6 months.

**As for Commodities I don’t understand the fuss** Who cares oil is now $37.93? this is a great thing for Uber, a great thing for Amazon, for PepsiCo, and for my discretionary spending (I drive a jeep the gas mileage is quite horrid.) But I do my share for global warming and guys what you have to understand is that cheap oil is great for everyone who isn’t trying to sell cheap oil. We should welcome it, find confidence in the new market equilibrium, and hope this delays getting some fracking runoff in our well-water! 

In conclusion, I’m not calling the top or the bottom, but I am calling the top for volatility for now. Valuations are out of whack, but this isn’t 2008, I don’t believe we should have the same concerns for our market as the Chinese have for theirs. If you are a lazy investor, now is the time to see red as an opportunity to buy. I’m not saying everything is a good deal. But this is a good time to brush up on fundamentals, get a basic understanding of operating cash flow, and hunt for value (and dividend value) understanding that it provides both downside protection and upside potential in the long run.",finance,1440467035

investing,"Don't forget what is really behind ""“The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"" - this is a marketplace, not a magical force","Meaning, the price of anything you see is determined by buyers and sellers.  For the price of something to go up, someone has to be on the other side of the transaction willing to buy it at a higher price.  There seems to be this underlying euphoria in so much of what I read on this sub that defaults to stocks going up both in the immediate term, because the economy is doing ok/better, and in the long term, just because it always has.  

Those can be very ethereal concepts but remember the famous advice above.  There's no force driving the market back up just because the economy is good.  If tomorrow there was some special amazing news on GDP, or the Fed made some one time bullish decision, or whatever it may be - the market doesn't go up on its own.  Millions of people just like you and me and, unfortunately, robots programmed in very sophisticated ways, have to BELIEVE that that information actually means something positive.  

And, just as important, do not forget that there are massive institutions literally billions of times larger than you that can make money in BOTH directions.  

So, what this means tangibly is - buying NFLX at $90 or AAPL at $92 - that's probably a safe bet that no one thinks those are the right prices.  But buying anything that falls a good number of % just because surely the market must go back up and this is just panic and this is a correction - you're going to have to find a buyer that believes that at some point down the road.

personalfinance,A Question about Student Loans/Financing,"Hi r/PF
I have a question about student loans and the like, and my first thought was to post it here. I've been a long time lurker, but I'm not sure if this is the place to post this question. If it's not I'd be happy to shift it elsewhere upon recommendation. My question probably requires a fair bit of background info (hence the throwaway) and is probably quite individual (although nothing would surprise me). So here goes

Background: I was born and raised in the UK and moved to the states with my parents through my dad's job when I was about 13. From then on, the plan was always to be in the States for 2 years, and then to return home. But my dad's contract kept getting extended, and long story short, we're still here now. Amid these extensions, it was always still expected that I'd attend college in the UK. When applications came about I applied in both countries because my college counsellor recommended it. Throughout all this I think my parents and I still believed I'd end up in the UK, but through a certain turn of events I ended up staying in the states. Now whilst, my dad has certainly done very well for himself, I'm going to go ahead and say if you haven't planned for your child to go to school in the USA it's hard to all of a sudden factor in that extra $60K per year. So the first two years of school went by, and my dad was able to pay. Come the third year my dad wanted me to take out a loan for a number of reasons. Primarily, he wanted to remain a little more liquid, which is fair enough. Secondly, coming from the UK, where student loans are quite common, my dad thought I should take one out - after all, my cousins of the same age had done just that. The difference being, government loans there come with a low interest rate, etc. and the overall cost of tuition is way lower to begin with (what I pay in 1.5 years would cover a degree there). As per the recommendation of my school I looked into private loans, and some federal options. I ended up taking out a private loan with citizens bank with an interest rate of ~ 8.5%. This is obviously really high, and that too with my dad, who is in a financially healthy position, as my guarantor. It's coming up to the time where I need to look into this again for the upcoming year, and I just feel there has to be a better option for me? I am dreading the idea of saddling myself with such crappy loans right off the bat? As for the citizens bank loan - I think that I am extremely fortunate that my dad can pay of most of it if need be. We've been talking about it and I think he's warming up to the idea of that. But for this upcoming year I would like to take out a loan or something, but not something that is as bad as the citizens bank one. This would be a great help to my dad as my brother goes to college. I'm not sure all of this made sense, but I just need some pointers. I feel so lost, and there's so much info out there that I just feel overwhelmed.

financialindependence,Owning multiple properties not for income.,"I have a guy at work that just told me he has 9 rental properties.  This just blew my mind with him only in his mid 30's as an engineer.  But the more I talked with him the more I realized, he's not trying to add to his monthly income.  He's looking at these things to retire with by selling.  So he's essentially making enough off each to put a little coin in his pocket and is eventually going to own 9(or more) houses outright in the next 20 years that he can sell off or just keep renting.  I've always thought of renting as a great way to add additional income but never the way he's playing it.  I guess I need to start thinking more long term...

I know this can be sketchy considering what happened to the market years ago and that renting can be a total hassle.  I live in  a type of oasis of areas in a highly technical city.  Cost of living/Pay is really good so he's never had an issue with not finding renters in mid level neighborhoods.

What do you guys think about this type of situation?  Yeah you're paying for the house but at interest rates the way they are, to me this just doesn't seem like a bad way to go about building a ton of equity long term.

personalfinance,How do I know whether it's financially beneficial for my partner and I to get married?,"Hello. Thanks in advance for any advise. 

My fiance and I have been together for five and a half years and we have a son together. Fiance has a few thousand dollars left in student loans. We both have very little credit (there's not enough information for me to generate a score on those free credit check sites). Neither of us is offered insurance through work. We all Qualify to be on our state's health insurance but, our unmarried status has made it very complicated. 

The last two years fiance has claimed head of household as he makes slightly more than I do so therefore covered slightly more of the cost of our childs care. The first year our federal refund was to be more than $6000 but, it was taken by the DOE for his outstanding student loan debts (which I thought he was taking care of but, that's another can of worms). So, that sucked. It sucked even harder when it happened again the next year even though we had been making regular payments all year and had been assured that our refund was not in danger.  

So, I guess my questions are:

Should I file as HOH this year even though I make less?

If we keep our filing the same, how can I be SURE they're not going to take our refund again?

Would it benefit our situation in any way to be legally married? 

Or are we crazy to even consider it until we both have our shit together?

I probably should have posted this on ELI5 because my level of knowledge on financial matters is basically that of a five year old. Thanks for your patience.

""Our main worry is that some trader or corporation somewhere, with a little too much debt and wrong about China's direction, will be put in some severe financial duress. Because of China's more closed economy, we don't, however, believe that a weakening China will result in the same financial contagion as the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. Still, the possibility cannot be ruled out, and with memories of 2008 and 2009 still fresh, potential fear can overwhelm the reality of the economic situation, causing investors to hit the panic button around the world.
The economic news was surprisingly good for the U.S. and even Europe (a nice increase in their purchasing manager reports) this week, perhaps suggesting that China is not the be-all and the end-all of the world economy. U.S. housing data was especially strong this week with recovery high housing starts and existing-home sales. Those strong numbers should have knock-on effects on the U.S. economy as those homes are financed, furnished, and remodeled.
Inflation was also surprisingly tame, taking a little heat off the Federal Reserve. Its most recent set of minutes, which seemed to show a greater willingness to raise rates, are not terribly relevant as the situation in China worsened. It's tough to justify a rate increase in the face of financial turmoil. However, it is highly unlikely that the Fed understood how strong the U.S. economy was in the second quarter. Next week, based on already-released data, we suspect the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will raise the GDP growth rate for the second quarter from 2.2% to a range of 3.0%-3.5% with the emphasis on the higher end of that range. For the full year we are still expecting U.S. growth of 2.0%-2.5%.""

I am partly thinking that I should save up for the car first because if my car quits on me then I won't be able to get my income or go to school and things will get real bad real quick. 

My thinking was save $12,000. $8,000 down payment for a car and take out a $8,000-$10,000 loan. The other $4,000 will be used for fee's taxes, insurance increases and as a small safety net.

We both work in NYC and live in NJ for cost of living context.  

I'm sure many will ask, why did you wait so long to pay off these loans if you have so much cash to pay them off?  The answer is that in the past few years I have gone from making &lt;$40k/year to gradually increasing my earnings to about $200k/year in 2015.  My wife has also contributed a lot to our savings/investments as she has a very strong job, was lucky enough to have her parents pay for college, and also a small trust fund.

personalfinance,"What are the best practices when taking $80,000 in student loans? Help me avoid pitfalls.","I’ve lurked for a long while and figured that while I’m staring down the barrel of taking a substantial amount in loans, I might as well ask for advice. I see lots of posts of people saying, “I wish I knew” or “I wish I’d done” etc, but most of those posts are unique to their situation, so I would like to be proactive and find the best strategy to navigate my coming debt.

I graduated with my bachelors debt-free. I was methodical and applied for literally hundreds of scholarships, kept a spreadsheet tracker, and having a 4.0 GPA helped, too. I did take a Federal Ford Direct Subsidized loan one year, but was able to pay it off the next year with a refund from scholarship money.

So now I will be attending veterinary school starting in the fall. Tuition is $22.5k/year for the first three years and then $18k for the clinical year. I already got a $6,000 scholarship for this year, so that brings the remainder for this year down to $16.5k. I made a spreadsheet to figure out my loans, which will be Federal Ford Direct Unsubsidized. Interest starts immediately upon dispersal, loan is dispersed once per quarter except summer, and interest is compounded daily. Assuming I don’t get any more scholarships and that the interest rate every year remains at 5.84%, I will be graduating in June 2019 with $90k in debt ($80k principle and $10k interest). I’d be happy to share my spreadsheet calculator if anyone would like to see it.

I know that is not nearly the amount of debt that others on PF have, but it is huge and I’m a bit terrified.

My parents (who are so amazing and very supportive) are paying most of my living expenses while I am in school. I live on a budget of $750/month, all inclusive. I have 7k in savings from working during undergrad but will be working only a few hours while attending vet school (and hopefully full-time during summers).

**So my questions to PF are:** Is it worth it to pay off the interest as it accumulates on my loans instead of letting it compound? Would it be a good idea or a horrible idea to pay part of my tuition with my savings to lower what I take in loans? Is there anything I don’t know but should about the best way to manage taking a substantial amount of debt?

The support of over 90% of active minters on the proof-of-stake network was required for the protocol to switch to 2.0, and it was achieved on the expected target date. The broader cryptocurrency market has responded by placing NuBits in the top 10 of daily transaction volume the past few days. 

Download Nu v2.0: https://nubits.com/download

Nu v2.0 upgrade thread: https://discuss.nubits.com/t/mandatory-upgrade-to-nu-2-0-by-august-25th/2497

For those interested, Nu 2.0 is packed with powerful new features:

**Dynamic fee** – This enhancement permits shareholders to vote to set transaction fees. The median vote is the fee. Transaction fees are also set using the fee from 60 blocks in the past. The client uses the highest fee to be charged in the next 10 blocks. Default transaction fees equal to the current transaction fees are applied if there is no transaction fee vote for a particular currency in the majority of share days for the voting period of 2000 blocks.

**NuShare custodial grants** - The custodian system now permits NuShare custodians. This process is exactly the same as with NuBits, except NuShares are granted to an NSR address.

**Protocol voting** - Clients now vote for their protocol version. Each version of the reference client has a protocol version number hard coded in it. This number is placed on the blockchain in the coinstake transaction when a block is minted, similar to how other votes are cast. This vote is not user configurable, so it has no user interface components. When 90% of the last 2000 blocks have voted to increment the protocol version AND any applicable date criteria for the protocol change is met, the protocol will change. If the percentage of the last 2000 blocks voting for a protocol version falls back below 90% threshold, no action will be taken. The protocol version in effect cannot be decremented.

**Change maximum interest rate increase/decrease** – This enhancement changes the maximum interest rate rise from 1% per 1440 blocks to a per block rise of 0.002% and enforces a maximum per block interest rate decrease of 0.004%. This allows an increase of approximately 3% per day and a decrease of 6% per day.

**Propagate the liquidity identifier through the network** – This enhancement changes the 'getliquidityinfo' RPC to now contain a liquidity tier breakdown and also a custodian breakdown. In addition, a new RPC ('getliquiditydetails') will return liquidity info of all the identifiers of each custodian.

**Make park rates effective 60 blocks after the actual vote** – As originally designed, parking rates are determined based on the rates published for the block that contains a parking transaction. This change uses the rate from 60 blocks in the past. This will permit the parking rates to be known 60 blocks into the future.",cryptocurrency,1440531748

As the title says, I am returning to school for a BAA in Finance (I have an AS) and I am wondering what would be the best payment method.

I have $14k in student loans ($4k subsidized and $10k unsubsidized) that I have been paying on for some time and I just got them into deferment. I plan to continue to pay on them just wanted to defer them to reduce the interest. 

I have been going to school this summer paying around $1k cash per 3 hour class and I am about to pay my fall tuition bill, about $3500. 

As an adult student making decent money I did not expect to get much financial aid but I completed the FASFA anyways. Here was my ""Award"" for the fall:

* Fed Direct Subsidized Loan $1,058.00
* Fed Direct Unsubsidized Loan $5,192.00	
* Totals $6,250.00


I have the cash to pay tuition, I have the credit and willpower to charge tuition (for the 1% cash back) and pay it off immediately, and apparently I could put all of the tuition on student loans.

And now the question:
How should I pay for my tuition bills?

personalfinance,ELI5: Why does US Treasury Interest Rate Up = Stock Market Down,"I've been listening to news radio and reading a bit about the stock market. Often there is mention about uncertainly regarding the US Treasury raising interest rates.  This is usually in reference to a recent drop in one (or all) of the major US indices.

Bitcoin,Personal overall Review of BTCJam in 2015,"Here's what to expect from BTCJam.com the P2P Bitcoin lending site, they function just like LendingClub in the USA and other parts of the world. I will point out some of the disadvantages for borrowers and Lenders who use or otherwise think of joining their site.

Here are a few tips that investors should consider when using BTCJam.

Poor investments will be made, you should be able to coop with this. BTCJam does not collect directly instead uses a Net-Arb, while it has worked for some folks, Net-Arb isn't accurate and you should consider a net loss. In short, never, ever put all your eggs in one basket. There is no way to select the best loans, BTCJam does not guarantee return on investment, and you are 98% chance at risk to loose your coins without collateral. 

There's no easy way to Rate Creditworthiness on BTCJam, although reading tools and repayment of a loan may make him or her more creditworthy, personally no technology or underwriting has been able to zero-out credit risks, BTCJam mentions it can rate someone based on social networks, identity, income and references and other undisclosed factors. But this rating technology is so new, the potential of this system is unproved. 

BTCJam can locked you away from an account if it wishes to,  Read: BTCJam Terms of Use which states ""The Company further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site at any time and for any reason."" Accounts can be locked to deposit and withdraw, this includes investors not just borrowers. 
Under 'TERMINATION' BTCJam also states ""The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time without notice, or suspend or terminate your access and use of the Site at any time, with or without cause, in the Company's absolute discretion and without notice.""

The information they ask users to submit; such as registration information which must be accurate and truthfully according to them, isn't always the case. There's very high amount of identity theft reviews online linking BTCJam with scammers using false information, and many users have had their information stolen and used online to obtain loans which they will never pay back. 

Let's start with stolen data information stored and verified by BTCJam, data is reviewed online. But how are they authenticating this information? Is entirely unsure, (e.g. challenge questions, secret questions, etc.)., However, BTCJam doesn't use an independent verification solution like this ( e.g. third party provider) or even mentions how they protect your personal information online. If you see their privacy policy BTCJam says the following: ""Any credentials you provide for access to financial institutions are passed on to one of our partners and are securely stored on their servers."" Are you sure your partners (business data and content providers or provider of content solutions) are never going to incur a breach for example or you, yourself hence you manually verify this information before is store online. How are you matching your data with other sources, and these providers prohibited from sharing and selling your data? The circle of questions goes on and on. You see, this information is passed down through different proprietary brands who want information about you, verify your bank data and BTCJam can even snoop in and see your account transaction or other information as they wish. 
They never publish any info on how the company is fighting fraud, borrowers credit and capacity to pay back debt or verifying factual data as whole. BTCJam should at least disclose how their company is complying with regulations in the US, or any country for that matter. You see, any day our country’s agencies can feel like locking up your Bitcoins because BTCJam isn’t up with complience and regulation. 

Scammers can do more than you think, they can Photoshop information, utility bills, hide their IPs/browsers/ and Block Cookies and other beacons, they can easy mask they IPs by using VPN Networks or Tor machines, VPS Machines and use on-the-clue machines. They can provide forwarding numbers or even create fake references. Anyone can easily purchase social network accounts on black-hat sites or private information.
Even the photo of you, they asked borrowers, you know the one BTCJam request you be next to a picture, can be purchase online. They can get their hands on social security cards or passport. Identity thieves can even attach bank information online with virtual bank access numbers. 

So how are investors protected when there is countless unresolved reviews about BTCJam allowing scammers with stolen information and even false information. This tells the company it hasn't even try to diminished or even attempt to verify and analized all this data. Instead, it is verified by an outsource solutions provider, but how are scammers still  under your nose? Simple, there is no modern techniques or way to separate creditworthy borrowers on your site, or even a full government compliance and due diligence to better provide your users with confidence. But you could at least implement something, instead BTCJam is driving honest borrowers and even investors away. 

For borrowers, personaly this is one think BTCJam hasn’t had the chance or push the site furthermore to preserve their honest borrowers and raises questions, although many startups rely mainly on a person’s credit history and personal data analytic, creditworthy borrowers and investors will never know. BTCJam does’t focused on also lower fees and interests for good borrowers in the US, and borrowers will never know if they qualify for loans at lower cost, and confuses good creditworthy american making the wrong choice between a shark loan with volitile losses  and low interest rate loan. 

By reducing origination fee loans for borrowers can significantly reduce the cost of repaying their loans, instead to BTCJam should pull credit reports and credit scores from actual credit bureaus for investors to see, soft credit inquiries or hard ones, with acknoledgement will definitely improve the site credit difference while making affordable loans available to borrowers with better credit scores. Let me know tell you my short story with BTCJam, recently they denied to offered me a loan for many different reasons, and won’t disclosed at least one. So here is how I feel they came up with such conclusion. I recently had 3 loans in the last 6 months, all repaid and some early. I had some recent references which bump my credit to a ( C- ), after submitting my fourth loan, a much more larger loan about $10,000 in BTC they denied to offer me a loan. 

Reasons why I think they would deny me a loan, scammers create 2 or 3 loans and on the fourth one they disappear. I have well research this matter and is a common patten and I think even good honest people would fall under this policy. After speaking with them on Facebook, I came up with several factors and even one investor on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/BTCJAM/comments/3hsxmq/listing_in_review_was_not_posted/ - who was nice enough to tell me to contact support as to the many reasons he/she thought they would get me back online. But especially how other regulatory bodies who enforce anti-discrimination laws would agree BTCJam fall under some government regulation in the United States and probably isn’t very adware about credit discrimination laws or what it is legal or not illegal to. In my short opinion I wouldn’t recommend BTCJam to anyone right now, and I cannot disclose my case but I have personally completed a complaint with the appropriate financial protection service, even though I cannot disclose reason why I have taken such action, I hope my review will be suffice and help the investors and consumers.",cryptocurrency,1440538387

I turn 18 next month and want to build up my credit and coincidentally looking to buy a new phone—the T-Mobile  64GB iPhone 6s ($749).

I've looked into the Apple Barclaycard and have briefly observed its 0% financing on new Apple products for 6, 12, and 18 months, which depends on how much I spend:

* 6 months: under $498
* 12 months: $499 - $998
* 18 months: $999 and over

-

[^Further ^information ^here](http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/finance/instant_credit)

I'm able to pay up the full $749 (+tax) after preordering the phone. I have a separate budget in my account reserved for buying this phone.

My concerns:

* I have to select the 12 month plan because I'll be spending $749, right?

* Could I pay the $749 within two months of opening the credit card, or does it have to be within a month? (*Referring to my ""worst case scenario"" here*)

* Is it ideal to just go to Chase (where my checking account is) and ask for an introductory credit card specifically to a build credit with no annual fee and a low interest rate?

I also plan to use the card to buy little things I can pay for: my $30 phone bill and other small monthly bills.

economy,Raising the interest rates well before now?,"I'm not an economist. That said, I am very much fascinated by that field of study. Here's my question: I realize that this economic downturn that we're experiencing with the stock market is mainly because of China. But wouldn't it have been wiser to raise the interest rates roughly back in June to Oct 2014 when the market started to give glimmers of being in overvaluation territory? I see that in that time period, the S&amp;P 500 CAPE was at around 25 (this is the only data that I have free access to). From what I've read, that's in the high limit of valuation. 

To me it doesn't make sense to flirt with raising the rates when the stocks are so close to correction territory. I realize that the Fed was looking for outward signs, for example, low unemployment rate. But don't you have to put the brakes on well before any outward signs such as that so that you can ease your way into a stable economy? 

To be fair, I first heard this idea somewhere else. I don't remember where. But they didn't specify the time period that I am specifying.",finance,1440543390

Other = $100/mo. (entertainment, toiletries, etc.)

Total = $900/mo.

personalfinance,(USA) Having a real problem calculating my W4 / potential tax shortfal after a house build,"hi all, using a throwaway here. 

I'm trying to calculate my W4 again before the end of the year to make sure I'm on track for not having a shortfall, or so I can figure out how much I need to withhold extra from my paycheck to make up a shortfall. 

Problem is, I'm getting wildly different numbers almost every time I use it, from a 5000 dollar refund to a 1500 dollar shortfall. 

I built a house last year and moved in, in December so I'm not 100% certain what my taxes are going to be. I'm using the TurboTax W-4 Withholding. 

Here's a summary of my circumstances.

I'm married, 29 years old, my wife is 25. We are both filing jointly and we are in Texas (So no state tax)., No kids or dependents either. No other income, no investments, and a mortgage. We both contribute to the 401k plans we have at work but it's a small amount. 

My wife has a student loan and we generally hit the 2500 dollar interest cap every year. 

So far this year I have made, gross, $49,285. Every paycheck I get $2,860 gross. I get paid every two weeks. According to my ADP statement I've paid $7,587 in tax this year so far. 

My wife this year has made $26,266 gross, and gets $1,468 gross every paycheck. She also gets paid every two weeks. And her ADP statement says she's paid $4,252 in federal tax this year. 

My mortgage, and this is where I seem to be having some trouble, says that last month I paid $777.05 last month on interest. It fluctuates but only slightly. So I'm assuming if I take that number, times it by 12 that means I will have paid $9,324.60 in interest on my mortgage this year. Give or take. 

Tax is the other issue, I have no idea what my taxes are going to be. The house was built on new land. We moved in at the last half of December and didn't have a Mortgage payment until January. The county appraisal district has an estimated tax of $5,787.21 however, I've been told that number is often inaccurate (don't know why) and following some other advice I applied for a personal homestead exeption.

If I plumb these numbers into the Turbotax calculator, add in my wifes student loan interest of 2500 dollars, tonight it tells me I'm looking at almost a $5000 dollar refund. That can't be right. I withhold an extra $100 from my paycheck, my wife withholds $30, and we withhold at the standard rate. I would have thought we would be 'under' and potentially owe tax. And for me, if I'm getting a refund of that magnitude then that spells bad news to me and it says we're doing something very wrong. 

Or.. .I'm doing every bit of my math correctly and that's actually right, in which case I shouldn't need to withhold anything... I'm extremely confused on what's right, wrong, or even if I'm going the right way",finance,1440559505

Now that I have showed my shame for all the world to see. I would love to hear some advice. Please, be brutal. 

I will be making *hopefully* $46,000. The only bills I have will be gas ($20 a week, work close), car insurance ($40 - paying % for using car) and mobile ($64 - tried leaving mobile plan but would cost more to close lease/ETF than to finish 24 month contract). I am blessed to be living with family who are willing to let me live rent-free. ALL income will go directly into repayment of these loans. ALL. I currently have $12k saved. 

I have two main strategies. One, I start paying on the loans right now (3 months left until November repayment date). I keep the interest 0 and pay weekly to eat into principal.

Second, I save until November and totally pay off the $16k loan, while making minimum payments on the other loans. I pay weekly on the loans - working on the $8k the most (next highest amount + interest rate). 

What do you advise? 

Do you think it is possible for me to pay all this off within a year? I really want to be debt-free.",finance,1440563530

personalfinance,"When a loan is transferred from one bank to another, does the old contract apply if I'm not notified by the banks of the transfer?","So, I have a bit of a problem. I got a loan from this bank. Ill call it Bank A. The interest rate was good and the bank was generally good to me. The loan was due after 24 months. Before signing off on the loan I talked to my account handler. I asked her to explain everything and she did. 

A few months down the road, turns out the bank was being too good to its customers and somehow could not maintain the standards and balances required by the state. The bank was closed. Lots of people made noise and the government decided to hand the bank over to another Bank which we shall call Bank B. 

Now Bank B did put ads in the news papers that it had acquired Bank A and that it was the new management. This was all good. A few months later I was laid off and couldn't keep up with my payments. So I'm behind about 8 months (Yes I know! What was I thinking and all but honestly its not been easy. I take full responsibility for that. That's not the problem however.) My repayment period is due in October. 

Problem is now the bank says they've handed my account over to another firm. Because apparently its their policy to hand over accounts that have defaulted after a specific period of time. Now as dubious as that sounds, its not the problem. The problem is that now I'm required to pay that firm 16% of whatever deposit I make on that account. Essentially 16% of the 8 months that I'm supposed to pay the bank. This on top of their monthly fines for defaulting.

I called a credit officer there and asked her how this would be done without informing me or letting me know about these terms and conditions. She said the bank had announced a change in management in the newspapers. To which I replied that not all of us read newspapers. I'm barely getting by as it is and the newspapers in my country are not exactly the most informative.

I told her that when I got the loan, the bank had taken down all my details. Phone number, emails, even a map to my house. All of which have not changed. I then asked why there was no notification through any of these details.

She asked me whether I expected the bank to write to me and inform me personally about the terms and conditions. I told her that I did. (She was basically implying that the bank cannot waste time on me as an individual. Especially given that I was a broke loser in their view) 

I tried to be as nice and calm as I could but this lady was being very rude. I told her that if a contract is signed between two people, the terms in that contract cannot be changed without consensus from both parties. Also in the event that those terms are changed there needs to be signed paperwork. 

At the end of the long conversation, the lady asked me to go to the bank with my contract. 

So what I would like to know is this, Am I naïve in thinking that these people are putting me in a position to pay more money illegally? Should I go to this meeting with my lawyer? Also is it the norm that when a loan is transferred from one bank to another its okay to do this without notifying me and can terms and conditions be added to the initial contract without my consent?",finance,1440582309

Like Stellaw I did not pay for the device and they only asked me for developer/user feedback.

The package was sent via FedEx protected by more foam than a bitmain S1, the keepkey comes packaged in a classy black box (about the standard of designer cufflinks packaging) on a green/white cardboard tray, with a plastic film protecting the screen.

Keepkey is much wider, longer and thicker than Trezor.  It does however feel extremely satisfying and solid in hand with its metal back shell.

The screen is fantastic to use, keepkey include some eye candy animations, progress indicator, and logo screen saver.

http://imgur.com/GXHbPLi

Side by side, Trezor's display is over twice as bright and of higher pixel density than keepkey, but with indoor use keepkey is adequately bright. The front shell is a fingerprint magnet.

I don't plan to fully review their software wallet as it is still in pre-release developer beta stage.  Keepkey works via desktop Chrome with 2 extensions (a proxy bridge and a Chrome Wallet). This solution is up an running with a few mouse clicks and supports device initialisation and wipe, PIN entry, send, recieve and display QR code.  Their wallet reminds me somewhat of kryptokit.

At the moment the Chrome Wallet does not support &gt;12 word mnemonics or passphrases (although Darin tells me this will be supported) nor changing PIN or device label, message signing, or transaction history.  Their chrome wallet checks balances through chain's API and is not dependent on a BoP server like myTrezor.

After some trial and error i was able to import my keepkey wallet into electrum 2.4.4 and saw the same balance and address tree as the Chrome Wallet.  

As the python tools and electrum plugin are dev beta standard, there are some bugs still to be ironed out, particularly with regards to passphrase support.

My overall impression is that keepkey will be a winner. With its wide screen display, keepkey is very easy on the eyes and makes checking of an address, transaction details or initializing a mnemonic (or reviewing entropy/firmware signatures) a pleasure.

Keepkey is evolutionary in several ways - much improved mnemonic playback and restore. They've re thought the user experience, removed the cancel button, and added a hold-to-confirm gesture. This does however mean ""cancel"" requires either a mouse or keyboard button press.

In other ways the changes don't go far enough, why limit PIN to numbers 1-9, why not device wipe after multiple failed attempts, why must the passphrase be entered in plaintext on the hot computer, why no touch screen and fewer buttons not more?

Keepkey's firmware is a fork of Trezor's, has had hundreds of code commits since March 2014 and is actively developed.  With its solid half metal construction, premium packaging, USB cable and security card, and 4 person management team - clearly keepkey is not targeting the budget end of the market.

Metal Trezor preorders were 3 times the price of plastic Trezors and keepkey has the differentiating features of premium metal build and finish, large screen and a mnemonic restore procedure so good that it is viable to wipe the device in between uses and restore to spend.

Their Chrome Wallet is missing many features, and currently there is no support for Greenaddress, mycelium or MultibitHD. (Whilst Trezor does support these 3 it took Trezor years before the first alternative - electrum 2.0 - became available)

Addendum : working with keepkey today they've isolated, fixed and developed a workaround for most issues I encountered.  Now the official OSX electrum 2.4.4 binary works perfectly - 24 word mnemonics, passphrases, message signing, change device label, full wallet history with modifiable descriptions.",cryptocurrency,1440600279

I am a grad student at an University in the upper midwest. I had taken out a loan for ~ $14K a year ago to buy a certified pre-owned car and was paying $260/month (x60 months) as repayment. I could not get a lower interest rate because I did not have a long credit history (international student, first loan, no co-signers).Although I and my wife have a current net income of $2500/month, I will be graduating in about a year with a very good chance of getting a job at the time of graduation. Our plan was to pay off the car as soon as I start making more money. However, I was recently in an accident and my insurance company has written off the car as total loss and will pay the bank ~ $8000 after the $500 deductible. I was upside down when I bought the car, so I took Gap insurance at the time of purchase. It looks like the gap insurance has to cover about $4500. I still have to talk to the gap insurance provider to check how much they will actually pay.

personalfinance,Need Student Loan Refinancing Advice,"Long story short, my wife has over $60k in student loan debt. I'm trying to figure out what we should and shouldn't refinance. Previously, she could get on income-based repayment plans, but my modest income put us out of the range of qualifying for it this year. We're jumping from paying about $460 a month to probably in the range of $700 to $750. 

Our monthly net income is around the $3500 range, plus we have a $926 a month mortgage, a $290 a month car loan (we live in a Midwestern City where public transport simply isn't a viable option), $90 in car insurance. Combined with a $750 student loan, that means we have about a third of our income remaining for gas, food, bills, and what luxuries we give ourselves.

Some background: I've always tried to be good with money. My wife is both not confident with money management and also dealing with the combo of being depressed and badly underemployed. Despite my efforts, we tend to only break even at best each month. 

I know we need to refinance. I can cosign, as I have excellent credit (790-ish, as of June). I'm looking at Citizen's Bank, as they offer sub 5% interest for excellent credit student loan refinances.

About $15k of her loans are wrapped up with FedLoan. I wasn't planning on touching them. What I'm trying to decide is whether to refinance only the Navient private loans or both the private and Federal loans we have through Navient. The details are below.

Navient Private Loans:
* $9,693.97 at 13% interest
* $8,271.05 at 9.75%
* $5,791.27 at 13.25%
* $9,764.13 at 9.75%

Stafford Loans through Navient
* $4,055.40 at 6.8%
* $3,116.90 at 6.8%
* $2,376.35 at 6.8%
* $5,882.36 at 6%

**My question is this:** I've been told that it's best to not refinance federal loans due to better flexibility with repayments. However, we've been denied income-based repayment and Citizen's Bank estimates refinancing to a 15 year loan (she's been paying them for 4 to 5 years already) for both the federal and private through Navient would lower our monthly payment by $215 per month, with a sub-5% interest rate. Refinancing just the private loans comes up to a $166 reduction in the payment with the same interest rate. With those factors in mind, does it make more sense to refinance both or should I still leave the federal loans in place?

Are there any other banks you would suggest for refinancing? Thanks, /r/personalfinance",finance,1440626356

investing,Considering a bond ladder. Pros/Cons vs Bond Index?,"A primer: I am helping to advise my parents on their 401k holdings.  They were holding cash throughout the whole recent boom over the past several years, and only recently have I been able to step in and try to provide some assistance.  Luckily, they have the means to live off of dividends from other investments, therefore my priority with this particular account is preservation of capital with lower risk growth as the objective.  They are in their early 60s and relatively healthy.

Currently we own AGG and LQD as our bond allocations in the retirement account, however it has not been doing very well recently, and also I am worried about a rising interest rate environment over the coming years (and decades).  We will not be using the bond yields for living income, we are simply using them to diversify risk away from being purely in stocks.

Now, I am OK with buying a bond, CD, or whatever, and holding it to maturity.  Therefore I am considering a bond ladder.  As I understand it, if you have the patience to hold to maturity, you get your principal back (assuming of course the creditor still exists).  To me, this seems like the way to go over holding a bond index, the price of which varies inversely with yield.  By holding the ladder bonds to maturity, you are essentially immune to this effect unless you need to liquidate early, is that correct?

So, I'd like to allocate equal amounts to bonds maturing in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.  When the 1 year bond expires, buy another 5 year, and so on until we own all 5 years with annual rolling maturity dates.  That way we get into to the higher yielding long term bonds for all the bonds we own.

Is there anything special I should know, or am overlooking?  Assuming all bonds are held to maturity, it appears that one achieves perfect preservation of capital (again, assuming the creditor is still there), while still benefiting from a rising rate environment.  Since you buy new bonds every year, you benefit from any interest rate hikes.

Any categories I should avoid?  Will I generally be OK as long as I stick with AA- and above?  Or is that too low?  With localities and cities claiming bankruptcy, should we avoid muni bonds?  And also, since this is a 401k, we should be ok purchasing taxable bonds, yes?  Is there any benefit to a bond fund like AGG besides liquidity?

Would you also suggest a CD ladder in a similar vein due to the added reassurance of FDIC insurance?  Rates seem somewhat similar, to be honest.  But I know the penalty for an early out is likely higher in the CD.

Thanks a lot!  Bonds are all very new to me, but I'm learning!",finance,1440636997
financial,Am I getting screwed?,"I've been working at a place, and here's how my pay looks and the time invested into the job

Tuesday through Friday I work 10 to 7, minus 30 minutes for lunch.
Saturday I work 11 to 7, minus 30 minutes for lunch.
And Sunday I work 12 to 6, minus 30 minutes for lunch

So altogether, that's 6 days a week, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, excluding lunches, at 47 hours

My checks are always $375. No pay stub. Just a business check. I don't punch in or out. I don't see any amount of taxes being withheld. Nothing.

I went to an interview for a new position at a different company last week, and when they asked about my current pay and hours, I told them and they tried to do the math and were sort of like... uhh... maybe he pays you salary?

Minimum wage in my area is $10 an hour. So really, I should be looking at 40 x 10, PLUS 7 hours of overtime, which should be time and a half ($15) which all equals out to $505

And then you take out federal and income taxes, which I have no idea what that percentage would be. But $375 seems ridiculously low... Don't you think? Is this employer screwing me?",finance,1440638923
personalfinance,Mortgage a house with my partner or go solo?,"I have a $100k salary (about 20k/yr I plan to save if I spend 20k on housing) and roughly 60k in savings and no debt right now. 
My partner is finishing the last year of a professional degree program this coming spring and is looking at a $115k salary but he has close to $300k in student loan debt of varying rates from 5-8%.
We are looking at a house in the 250k-300k range.

Two questions: 
Would we get a better interest rate if we apply for a home loan together given that this will have a higher total income or would this be negatively offset by the additional debt? (Current loan rates are making us consider doing something sooner rather than later)

personalfinance,(USA-NJ) Moving out of abusive household to friend's house. I need to get my finances in order. Please help. (F19),"Hey,

I'm located in NJ. After dealing with an abusive (emotionally and physically) household my entire life, I'm sick and fedup and mentally drained. I spoke with my close friend's family (she's basically a sister) and they said I can move into their spare room until I finish college. I'm currently a junior, starting the year in 2 weeks.

I just got approved for a $16k loan from Sallie Mae (10.125% var, 12% fixed, 25/month payments if not deferring). I need 2.5k a semester for school, and the rest is for other expenses. They fund the school one semester at a time, and currently my balance is 2.5k. The difference they will give me a check for. I need the extra cash right now for the car. I did it this way because my dad will be the co-signer on this and he didn't ask any questions. Any other type of loans and he would have. 

I have a cheap, reliable car offered to me for around 2.5-3k. I'm expecting insurance to be around 1.5-2k a year. Around 5k for the car this year, not including gas.

I need to get a new phone provider because currently I pay for my whole family's phones from my paycheck (about $200). I'm going to cancel that account, which is under my dad's name, as soon as I get out. I'm expecting the phone bill to come out to $60 a month at the high-end. I already have an iPhone, so I just need the monthly charge for service. No equipment charges.

I had a surgery a year ago, insurance covered 80%, but that leaves me with $14k in debt and a $70/month payment at my current rate.

I have a job on campus under work-study, so I get around $450 a month from there after all taxes. I have only $700 saved up due to being forced to spend everything on family bills. Just over the summer my parents rode up my credit card to around $800 which I have to pay off. It's interest free for another 9-10 months, so that's the only glimmer of hope I have for that.

All ""nights out"" and things like that, my boyfriend said he would more than happily cover for me. But we don't do expensive things too often, and we both don't drink/club/party so that's a great expense saved. He's also doing the initial repairs/fluid changes for the car and each oil change after that. Unfortunately he can't help me with housing due to issues w/ his family.


This is what I'm totaling right now.

$16k loan - 5k for car - 5k/year tuition = $6k left over. At the end I want to cycle this back into the loan to help pay it off.

$450/month - 50 for gas - 100 for groceries/food (myself+friend's family) - 60 for cellphone - 70 for medical bills - 50 for credit card - 25 for student loans - 50 to savings - 45 to emergency funds = 0 left over.

I'm thinking this is the best option for me. I'm over-estimating all my values, as far as I know, not underestimating. Anything left over will be transferred to savings.

I have no real-world experience w/ this. I'm looking into a second job right now at night, and I'll probably jump on any chance I get for that. Is this plan as good as it can get in my situation? Can I improve anything? Change anything? Literally any input would be appreciated...",finance,1440641183
personalfinance,Shitshow concerning former owner's bad credit and transfering an auto title to my name.,"Things you need to know;

·I am 19, with approximately 1 year time in service with the National Guard. This is only relevant as maybe some of you know some cool financial loopholes I can finagle as a service member.

·I paid $1500 down for a 2015 Kia, under my mother's name. She, in no uncertain terms, tricked me into putting the car in her name so that I would be paying at her interest rate, and therefor repairing her credit. This is my fault, but it happened. She made me think a lot of things about money and finance stuff that I didn't know better about at the time. I get that it's my bad, but I'm trying to fix it now. 

·The car as of now is costing me $441 monthly. My mother direct deposits $200 in my bank account every 3 weeks (give or take) as help, which I do appreciate. But I can't afford this. I'm paying over $250/mo just in interest. That goes toward absolutely nothing. Like. What?? 

·My bank account continues to get overdrawn to make these payments. I work an average 30 hour work week at just under $8/hr. I am basically working just to pay off the overdraft, and then overdraw it again. 

·My main question as of right now IS: Can I transfer this title to my name and lower the interest rate?? I know that if I keep our current lienholder, my interest rate will likely stay the same. So I need to find a new lienholder, right? Need wisdom ASAP.

·I also want to stress that giving up the car and getting a used one in its place is not an option, or at least, it's a really shitty one. I work and have monthly drills and military excercises, sometimes out of state, that I cannot just ""miss"" because I ""don't have a ride"". I can barely afford my own food these days, Ja feel? 

I've always tried to be really independent and not ask for people's help, but I'm really struggling here. This is my first car and I'll do anything to fix things and repair my financial situation before I get totally fucked to the point I can't repair it. Any advice is ultra appreciated. Tyty.

personalfinance,Senior in College stuck between a Finance and Marketing major. Can I get some advice here?,"**TL;DR: Marketing is my major but I live breath and eat finance (investing). What do**

I'm 21, going to be a senior this coming year. I am a business student at UCONN (Heard of it?). I am pursuing a marketing degree, with a comm minor.

I always figured **marketing** was my love in life. I like the analytics, I like how it is an art and a science, I like how it is dynamic and changing, it involves a lot of physical movement and travel not to mention meeting people. I like that it is creative and changes between industries; but lately I've fallen in love with **finance**.

Last summer I did an internship in insurance. I hated it. 40 hour weeks trap in a cube on the 14th floor of some building, cramming through menial spreadsheet work with only one or two ""friends"" in the entire building. Even my manager warned me of the 9-5 life, telling me that if he could, he would get out the first chance he got. 

I spent a lot of time while at this internship learning how to get ""out"" of the ""American Dream"". By that, I mean the whole I-hate-my-job, 40hr/week, stressful lifestyle. The only feasible escape I found (apart from the right job) was to finish school, live a frugal life and save money early on. The whole experience lead to some pretty healthy habits about saving and spending money, but it also warned me about how terrible life could be if I goof up now.

With those healthy habits became a new fascination: **investing**. I started out with $3,000 gifted to me from my grandfather in a brokerage account. I have since then added close to $10,000, opened another brokerage account and an IRA. I follow the market religiously. I can name the prices of most blue chip companies. I can speak the language. I learned how to trade options. I understand ETFs, I understand margin, how to read financial statements. I can explain to you why the DJIA is down, what it means if the fed hikes rates, why the economy is volatile, what is happening in china, why oil and $2/gallon gas is coming. I am actually *depressed* on Saturday/Sunday because the market is closed!

Here's the big thing: **Everything I have learned is self-taught**. I have spent hours reading about this stuff because I enjoy it and I like to pass my free time with it; **but I can not tell you the last time I looked into ANYTHING marketing related despite marketing being my major**.

I am really concerned that marketing might not be the right major for me. I have heard that a business degree can get you into any department (Accounting, finance, MIS, management) but I am now considering changing my major last minute. I can probably make it fit.

I have also thought about getting an MBA. Would it be possible to aim for a MBA that explores finance?

personalfinance,Overwhelmed by tax situation,"I have really put myself in a big hole. This year I filed my 2013 and 2014 federal taxes. I work as an independent contractor so taxes were not withheld. After receiving a few bills I received a form for setting up payments. A few weeks later I was sent a letter saying that they were still gathering information. Followed by a final notice for 2014 the following day. I called them on Monday and was told that I have to file 2009-2012 as well. I didn't realize I had even made enough to file those years. My income is very low. I feel like now I am going to owe so much that I won't be able to catch up. Especially once I file 2009-2012 and see what fees I'm slapped with. There's a few things I want to know. 

First of all once I file those back returns (I will owe for all of them I'm sure) am I in the clear for getting in trouble for any kind of tax evasion? I honestly did not know I had made enough to file. I wasn't trying to pull one over on anyone. :/ This keeps me up at night and honestly has caused me to have a lot of break downs since calling them on Monday. I didn't ask about this because I was too afraid. 

Once my previous returns are accepted do I have to have made all my quarterly payments for this year before I can set up a payment plan? Meaning will I need to make all three of the previous quarterly payments for the year by September 15th? If so what do I do if that is too much money for me to pay?

Overall I am wondering what my options are if this is really all too much for me to pay? I only make about 10,000-12,000 dollars a year and I'm afraid I'm looking at a tax bill that size. I know I have made a giant mistake by not taking care of this yearly but I am trying to not focus on that and just fix it now. 

Any advice on the steps I should take to fix all of this would be greatly appreciated. I am currently waiting for the IRS to send me income transcripts before I can file the back returns. They are giving me until Sept 30th to get those in. This has all left me feeling overwhelmed, hopeless and to be honest terrified. I've never been in trouble a day in my life and I really, really hope this isn't going to land me in jail or with a drained bank account.",finance,1440650565

from about 1:11:11 he says this
     
    The really crazy, radical experiment in money, 
    isn't Bitcoin..
    
    In the last six years there has been an absolutely radical experiment in money,
    and that is,
    that in the first time in history,
    central banks took interest rates to zero.
    
    And it wasn't just one of them, even though it was unprecedented,
    but 21 central banks have taken the interest rates to zero.
    Left it there for 6 years.
    And cannot raise it again, because if they raised it a tiny bit..
    the entire economy would collapse.
    
    This has never happened before.
    
    It's the most radical monetary policy experiment since the introduction of central banking in the 1920's.
    We don't know how it will end
    But in most likelyhood it will not end well..
    
    In monetary terms what we have done at this point,
    is like giving someone, giving the economy,
    an intravenous cocaine drip on full blast.  
    For 6 years.

    And at some point there is going to be a hangover.
    And it is going to be brutal,
    because now the patient is barely awake on a full drip of cocaine.

    And we are running out of cocaine..",cryptocurrency,1440661592

I'm 22 and a senior in college. I've made some bad financial choices now I'm 3k deep in credit card debts.
 I'm currently in between jobs and the interest is accruing.  My school offered me a 5k subsidized loan. Since they are interest-free while you're in school, is it wise to use the loan to repay my debts?
 I also was thinking that as soon as I find a job, I would try to repay it before I graduate because I want to graduate loan free.
Also I will have 2k to play with. I don't want to waste it on just personal stuff. I'd there a way I could invest it? Like those accounts that you can't touch but still have a monthly interest rate. 
Does my plan make any sense and is it viable? 
I'm open to any suggestions.


Edit: Thanks to everyone who took the time to answer. I've read all of your answers and considered all your advice.

I have loans from this as well as my undergraduate. My situation is quite confusing (for me, at least) but I'll try to lay it all out:

* 48,000 in federal loans with interest rates ranging from 3.4-6.8%
* plan to make 30-40k once I start work in January
* plan to have little to no rent to pay
* plan to work in non-profit/NGO, so would most likely be eligible for PSLF
* eligible for every repayment plan on every loan except one (that one is total $3,399, interest rate 6%, eligible only for standard, standard graduated, and IBR-not for new borrowers)

My dad passed away in January leaving behind quite a bit. I now currently have about 80k in cash savings, an inherited IRA worth 30k, $1,300 coming in monthly in life insurance payments, and another 50k IRA from him that I haven't decided what to do with yet. There's also a house.

So what is the best option to take. As far as I see, I can either

* a) stay on IBR(or can I? I technically have very little income right now, but a lot of money) or do PAYE and go for 10-yr PSLF
* b) go on standard repayment and get it over in 10 years
* c) pay it all off now, and invest the remainder
* d) pay high interest loans off now, continuing making payments on IBR/PAYE with PSLF? (start making investments too?)
* e) pay high interest loans off now, continue making payments on Standard (start making investments too?)
* f) consolidate my loans in combination with any of these other options
* g) some other combination of the above that I haven't thought of yet

I have a lot of options, which I know is a good problem to have, but I am not good with money and my brain is having a hard time wrapping itself around all this.

finance,Looking for advice on finding positions in NYC.,"So ever since I was a little kid I have wanted to be involved in Investment Management. My Mother used to be an overnight fed funds broker, and moved something in the neighborhood of 6 Billion a week to various banks. This lead to us taking multiple trips to NYC as a kid, and when I fell in love with NYC. I visit NYC about three to four times a year, and a few of my Fraternity brothers live there now, but are not in the industry.  

I am currently finishing up my joint MBA/MS(Finance - Asset Management) (3.25 GPA), from a well ranked program. I plan on pursuing a CFA thereafter.  I have 5 years of Direct and Wholesaling experience under my belt for 401k record-keeping. I love the deals side of our business, so front office is where I feel I would fit best in. I am open to pursuing opportunities outside of the 401k side, and would like to focus more on the investments portion. I am 26 years old, and I feel as though it would be an ideal time to try to make this transition. I have read plenty of journals as far as what work might look like on a day to day basis. So I am not afraid to sacrifice social time, or work long hours, late nights.

But I am still very hazy on just how to get up there, and get my foot in the door. I am also trying to get a better idea of what income may look like. I have checked Glassdoor, but I feel that is still not a very good representation of what the take home is. As the AE's I support take some in the range of 500k and on the website they list them to take home 125k. Are recruiters worth checking into? Should I still to the large companies? How would one get a job in a smaller shop? I am open to being PM'd for further detail and more in-depth conversation.

personalfinance,"26 years old, about to start a 5 year PhD program and need advice about how to invest 80K in savings.","I’m 26 years old and about to start a five-year PhD program in Boston for which I will be receiving a stipend of about $30,000 per year (so just enough to live on). I’ve been working the last few years and I have about $80,000 saved in my bank account in addition to about $30,000 in retirement accounts ($20,000 in a Roth IRA and the rest in normal IRAs) and no loans of any kind. I also have $10,000 in my checking account as my emergency money. I’m trying to decide what to do with the $80,000 sitting in my bank account and would greatly appreciate advice from the community. The trouble is, it’s hard to know if and when I might need this money so it’s hard to know if I should invest for the long term or short term. In particular, I’m thinking it might be wise to consider buying a small apartment in Boston in the next couple of years so that my money can go into mortgage payments instead of rent (and I could have a roommate to help cover the mortgage payments). But I’m not sure if this is the right thing to do. 

Given all the above information, here is a current possible plan for the 80K I have sitting around: Place 50k in a high interest savings account (I found one from Savings Direct with a 1.25% interest rate), and then place the remaining 30K in a number of different low expense ratio index funds. I would plan to leave the 30K in the index funds as I could (ideally 10 years +) and the 50k I would use to contribute the yearly max to my Roth IRA as well as make use of if/when I decide to buy an apartment. Although, do I want to perhaps be placing more money in IRAs than directly into mutual funds? What is the advantage of one over the other?

Alternatively, if I give up on the apartment-buying idea, I could invest most of the 80K more aggressively in various index funds.

personalfinance,Stuck in my house?,"I'm looking for some advice here. At this point, I feel like I'm being punished for making 'safe' or 'reasonable' financial choices over the past few years, and often find myself wondering how any millennials are able to afford to buy a house, start a family, etc.

My situation is that my wife and I both work, we make what I think is a pretty good income for our area. We don't have much debt (1 auto loan, small amount of student loans), have a decent emergency fund. 10 years ago, we got tired of living with roommates (as married couples seem to do), and we found at the time that we could buy a small home for the same or lower monthly payment than renting our own apartment/house. So we bought a small home, got what was at the time a decent interest rate (6.6%). The bank would have approved us for a higher mortgage amount, but we didn't want to over-extend ourselves.

Now, 10 years later, we've decided we want to move to something larger. We aren't looking for a McMansion or anything; just a 3 bedroom home with a 2 car garage, and a little bit of yard. Two bathrooms would be really nice...But we simply can't find anything we can afford. I'm not opposed to buying a home that needs some work put into it (put quite a lot of work into our current house), but we're looking at houses at the top our budget that need tens of thousands of dollars in repairs (new siding, new septic systems, new roof, new furnace, etc etc). 

We could do what so many people do: blow the emergency fund and beg and borrow enough money to make the down payment on a house we can't afford, hoping that we can scrape by paycheck-to-paycheck with the nebulous hope that our income will rise someday in the future.

The obvious answer of course is to just wait; but we've already been 'waiting' 10 years, and I fear at this point that over the next few years, rising interest rates are going to make the mortgage more expensive, offsetting whatever money we'll be able to save, and by the time we save enough to buy the kind of house we need, it could be too late to start a family.

A lot of people are saying that this is just a bubble, and when it pops we'll be able to afford something, but who knows how long that will be, and when it does pop, I'll probably lose what equity I've got in my house now.",finance,1440708917

Summary

On Monday, August 24th, the Fed injected $18.54 billion from a ""reverse repo fund"" filled with cash accumulated at the end of QE3.

The $18.54 billion was exponentially greater than what has been previously needed to stabilize stock prices.

On Monday &amp; Tuesday, primary dealers failed to move stocks up, because overhead resistance was too strong, and a tactical retreat left the DOW down by a combined 793 points.

On Wednesday, the Fed added $4.446 billion, and combined with a mildly positive durable goods report, the primary dealers succeeded in pushing the DOW upward by an astounding 620 points.

A September rate hike is off the table, but soon the Fed will have to accept a huge drop in stock prices or a return to money printing.

There was a time, pre-2007, when the Fed could move the DOW up or down by 100-200 points merely by injecting or withdrawing a few hundred million dollars. The idea of injecting a whopping $18.54 billion, in one single day, was something that would have been impossible to imagine. Times change...

On Monday, August 24, 2015, the Fed injected more than $18 billion dollars. In spite of that, the DOW dropped by 588 points, and by the end of trading on Tuesday, it was down a combined 793 points for the two days. What I am talking about? I am talking the sudden failure of the traditional methods that the Federal Reserve uses to control the behavior of millions of investors.

How they injected new money into the market, without actually printing any new money yet, requires a discussion of the little known concept of something called ""TOMOs"" and ""REVERSE TOMOs"". At the end of QE3, the Fed collected just over $100 billion of the then-newly-printed dollars into a fund composed of ""REVERSE TOMOs"". As you will see, REVERSE TOMOs work exactly opposite to the manner in which TOMOs work. So, to avoid confusing you, I must get into a discussion of what these two things are.

The Fed has been pushing markets upward by actively printing a lot of money ever since 2001. The first phase of the printing extravaganza was not called ""QE"" because, theoretically, the money that was printed was not permanent. Non-permanent money printing is called a ""temporary open market operation"" a/k/a ""TOMO"" a/k/a ""repo transaction"". ""QE"" is something different. It is officially known as a ""permanent open market operation"" a/k/a ""POMO"". To understand what I am talking about, I have to start talking about an area of finance which is somewhat confusing.

TOMOs, or ""repo loans"" can be thought of as a type of temporary QE. The central bank prints up a quantity of money, usually at the request of its primary dealers, the dealers take the money, and they hand over bonds in return. The money is used for whatever the big banks want to use it for. In practical terms, it is used for influencing stock, bond and commodity price both up and down, depending on Fed policy.

Another transaction, used by the Fed and its dealers is the so-called ""reverse repo"" or ""REVERSE TOMO"". In this type of operation, the central bank hands back the bonds, and the primary dealers hand back the money. The process of using TOMO and REVERSE TOMOs to move prices involves catalysis, rather than brute force. Neither the Federal Reserve, nor any other central banker for that matter, has the resources to fight the entire market.

Careful coordinated use of cash, however, can catalyze changes in market pyschology, and that is often enough to change momentum. The primary dealers use the cash to basically ""paint the tape"", so that patterns are created which provide buy and sell signals to other investors. This allows the Fed to move markets broadly up and down.

Unlike the case with outright QE (POMO's), primary dealers are actually supposed to pay back TOMOs. The repayment myth is why very few people screamed and yelled, between 2001 and 2007, when this method of money printing was the primary one used to fund a rising stock market, and between 2007 and 2009 to slow down the collapse. It was much less controversial than QE because, theoretically, when the money is repaid, it disappears from the system.

Theory, however, often doesn't work in practice, as we'll discuss in a moment. But, before we get into the repayment issue, it is worth a look at how the Fed describes the process:

Among the tools used by the Federal Reserve System to achieve its monetary policy objectives is the temporary addition or subtraction of reserve balances via repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements in the open market. These operations have a short-term, self-reversing effect on bank reserves.

It is hard to remember all the various names for these transactions. Remember, that a ""repurchase agreement"" results in a TOMO, and a ""reverse repurchase agreement"" results in a REVERSE TOMO. The idea that these ""loans"" are ""self-reversing"" is deceptive. It is only true if they are repaid in a timely manner. If not, the end result is the same as outright QE. Between 2001 and 2007, TOMOs and REVERSE TOMOs were used as a primary method of pushing markets up and down.

As you may note from the quote, the Fed alleges that the loans are ""overnight"", implying they are paid back the next day. That cannot be further from the truth. Almost every morning, going back several decades, the Fed has kept itself very busy, by making new ""loans"" as great or greater than the ones before. The primary dealers repay the first ""loan"" with the second, the second with the third, and so on and so forth.

The bottom line is that the Federal Reserve does not get paid back for these allegedly ""overnight"" loans on the next day. Instead, they get renewed by the issuance of new loans, day after day, week after week, and month by month. That way, the dealers can carry out Fed policy until they can finally make money off the money by pressuring markets in the desired direction.

The Fed balance sheet shows an ever-growing balance of repo ""loans"" given out between 2001 and 2009. Eventually, they amounted to a running balance of hundreds of billions of dollars, constantly rolled over at maturity for almost a decade. It was essentially a Ponzi scheme, except that the central bank was running it, so it could never break down. Instead, it facilitated an endless expansion of the money supply. This manifested mainly in asset inflation, but was also paid for by commodity inflation during the first decade of the 21st century.

According to the Federal Reserve website:

The Fed uses repurchase agreements, also called ""RPs"" or ""repos"", to make collateralized loans to primary dealers. In a reverse repo or ""RRP"", the Fed borrows money from primary dealers. The typical term of these operations is overnight, but the Fed can conduct these operations with terms out to 65 business days.

Remember, repurchase agreements are TOMOs. ""Collateralized"" is a fancy way of saying that bonds are posted before the Fed gives out the cash. On maturity, the dealers are theoretically supposed to take their bonds back. But, between 2001 and 2009, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet showed an ever-ballooning mass of repo loans. The loans were never paid back. They were simply renewed, over and over and over again.

The running total of hundreds of billions in repo loans was finally repaid ONLY when the primary dealers received newly printed cash when the Fed started admitted to doing permanent cash printing (""QE""). This gradual process began in March 2009. You can review the entire history of the Fed's repo injections, a/k/a ""temporary open market operations"" a/k/a ""TOMOs"" here.

When you compare each TOMO to the movement of the DOW, S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ, you will find a very strong correlation between large cash TOMO injections and ""up"" days. The ""T"" in TOMO stands for temporary, even though the loans are more or less permanent gifts. As with POMOs (QE), money is printed, and, as with POMOs (QE) there is an excellent correlation between injection of cash and a rise in stock and bond prices. The correlation is not perfect, of course, because other factors, like a fantastic news day, can offset the need to inject new money, or even allow some to be taken out.

Once QE began, the TOMO process became irrelevant, and was eventually phased out, because the primary dealers no longer needed them. The process of open and obvious money printing provided them with a permanent source of ready cash, and a market for bonds that could not be profitably sold into the free market. The primary dealers have been very successful in using both the TOMOs and the POMOs to catalyze upward movement in stock and bond markets.

In light of that success, retail investors returned to the market, en masse, during the last phase of QE3. In the midst of that euphoria, not all the printed money needed to be injected right away, and the Fed did some REVERSE TOMOs, holding back some of the newly printed QE money, putting together a sort of emergency reserve fund. Remember, REVERSE TOMOs are the opposite of TOMOs. Money was printed in the POMO (QE) process, and then, because it wasn't needed immediately, it was taken back in the REVERSE TOMO process.

In the end, a fund was created that is essentially a collection of surplus cash, left over from QE3. The existence of this pool of money has allowed the Fed to operate in markets, over the last year, injecting and remove liquidity, without being accused of money printing. Remember, in a TOMO, the Fed takes in bonds and gives out cash. In a REVERSE TOMO, it takes in cash and gives out bonds. Again, if you look at the history, on the days the Fed was accumulating the reverse repo cash fund, stocks mostly went down. Whenever the Fed releases cash from the fund, stocks mostly go up or stabilize if they are going sharply down.

The ""REVERSE TOMO RESERVE FUND"", as I will call it, is a running balance of REVERSE TOMOs, amounting to somewhere between $65 and $120 billion dollars depending on the day. Remember, the fund is composed of REVERSE TOMOs, not TOMOs. Therefore, when the size of the fund goes down, it means that the Fed has injected cash into the system. Similarly, when the size of the fund increases, it means the Fed has taken cash out.

When you look at the numbers, remember one critical point. REVERSE TOMOs operate in exactly the opposite way the TOMOs did during the period 2001 to 2007. The fund that is being deployed is not made up of newly printed cash. It is made up of excess money that was printed up at the end of QE3 but not used back then. The Fed reacts to falling markets by releasing cash from the fund.

Take a look at the history and you'll quickly discover that stock prices rise when cash is released (the REVERSE TOMO dollar amount will fall as a result) and stock prices fall when cash is taken back into the fund (the REVERSE TOMO dollar amount will rise when cash is taken back). The end result has been to stabilize the stock market at approximately the same level as a year ago. This convinced the average Joe Investor that the good times are here to stay.

Unfortunately, times change. There has never been a successful centrally planned economy in the history of the world. It didn't work for the old Soviet Union, and it won't work for America. The intense effort to micromanage the American economy, undertaken over a period of several decades, is also due to fail. It is only a question of when, not if.

In ""olden times"" (pre-2008), injection in the range of $23 billion would catalyze a massive 2,000 point ""up"" day on the DOW. That's why it was never done. But, now, the Fed is dealing with the implosion of a boom set into motion by a credit bubble it created. It is a whole new ballgame. The dealers and the Federal Reserve, however, seem to have underestimated how much money they needed to reserve, at the end of QE3, in their ""Reverse Repo Reserve Fund"". They also seem to have underestimated the amount of cash it would take to change the market's momentum this past Monday and Tuesday.

In spite of injecting $23 billion, the DOW (NYSEARCA:DIA) still collapsed by 588 points, S&amp;P500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) by 78 points, and the NASDAQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) by 170. It was not a total failure. Not yet. Remember, on Monday, the DOW was down by 1,078 at one point. It closed down only 588 points. It was fascinating to watch the events unfold. In the early morning, stocks plummeted in almost a straight line. Then, as banks anticipated receipt of the cash, typically delivered at 1:15 pm, stocks recovered.

Stocks reached a peak around the exact time the money was delivered by the Fed. But, when the money actually arrived, the ""buyers"" began trying to sell. Closing long positions in an orderly manner is essential for the success of a upwardly bound market manipulation. It could have been done, if the dealers had been able to create such chaos. But, it didn't work. Stocks began to head downward again.

In the first part of the last half hour of trading, the longs (I surmise that they are the primary dealer controlled hedge funds) seemed to make a last-ditch effort to catalyze upward momentum. Yet, in an intensely negative sentiment situation, one must quickly sell long positions, or risk getting stuck with big losses. The buyers seemed to try desperately to cover longs before the end of the trading day.

It didn't work again. Once the longs tried to sell, stocks raced down in the last 10 minutes or so of the trading day. It was fairly obvious on Tuesday, the next day, that the Fed was far from finished. The dealers may have staged a tactical retreat on Monday, but they were armed and ready. The futures market was bid up heavily in the early morning hours, and that the indexes were looking spectacular.

As the cash market began trading, however, sellers took over again. The intensity of the selling ended up foiling the longs. Again, the attempt to catalyze upward market movement failed. The DOW ended up down by 205 points. On Wednesday, with the addition of another $4.446 billion in ammunition from a reduction in the reverse repo fund, they finally found success.

The day started off well, with some good news about durable goods. Then, various voting members of the FOMC began telling the public that a September rate hike was ""less compelling"". The combination of a bit of good news, Fed official jawboning, and with a dollop of extra cash to capitalize on it, the dealers managed to raise the DOW by 619 points.

It will be impossible to maintain this momentum without huge additional cash injections. This is illustrated by the fact that the ISE Sentiment Index, which indicates how many real investors want to buy stocks, printed at a sad 79 at the end of the big rally Wednesday. In other words, the rally was contrived, and additional upward catalysis operations will require larger and larger sums of cash.

All of this leaves the Fed in a pickle. Throwing $23 billion at a falling market, didn't stop the decline of stock prices. If they throw in another $23 billion, every three days, stocks will be suspended for longer, or will fall by a only a mediocre amount. But, this cannot go on forever. The current ""reverse repo fund"" has already been drained down to $68.719 billion. That's only enough for a few more trading days. Once it is drained down to zero, the Fed is out of ammunition.

At the zero point, they will be forced to return to either overt money printing (QE) or the covert money printing (TOMOs that are never paid back). Otherwise, there will be a very large percentage decline in virtually all the indexes. We will see either a Great Depression style stock collapse, or a new money printing program. Since ""QE"" is now a dirty word, they will call it something else. Probably, they will go with the covert TOMO route. In the end, however, it is all the same. They will print money.

Between now and then, you could lose a lot of money. During the period 2001-07, the daily cash TOMO injections typically amounted to only a few hundred million dollars. Now, the injections will have to be exponentially greater. At $20 billion a pop, people will begin to notice, regardless of how covert the Fed tries to behave. The end result will be a loss of confidence in the Federal Reserve.

Money printing, however you call it, has a profound effect on precious metal prices. From 2001 to 2009, for example, when TOMOs were used exclusively, gold more than tripled in response to a substantial increase in the money supply. Later, when the POMOs (QE) began, gold soared to $1,900. Both money printing methods put heavy upward pressure on precious metals prices.

The current administration seems dead set on stopping gold from being a ""canary in the coal mine"" that lets investors know what is really going on. It appears to have taken the role as ""supplier of last resort"" in the gold market. Admittedly, it has thousands of tons of the yellow metal. Theoretically, US-owned gold could feed markets for a long time, filling excess demand, and restraining prices against their natural tendency to rise. But, not even America has unlimited resources.

Filling even the current level of supply deficiency will drain the gold reserve to zero in only a few years. And, with the probable loss in confidence in the Fed, the drain will increase exponentially. The gold reserve might not even last a year after that. It is unlikely that the powers that be, desperate though they may be, will risk everything. They are well aware that gold reserves may be critical in the new monetary world that finally unfolds after this crisis is over.

Precious metals prices will eventually rise dramatically. It is just a question of whether it happens this year or 2-3 years in the future. That's why, right now, buying gold as a long term hedge is your best bet. For those caught still holding stocks, however, the good news is that more cash injections are on the way. It is the only method that the Fed can use to offset the speed by which stocks are falling and it will happen until the Reverse TOMO Reserve Fund is entirely exhausted.

About $68.719 billion remains and it will be used before the Fed considers any more money printing. It is reasonable to expect that a combination of cash injection, jawboning and hyping up of stray pieces of good news will be used, in the near future, to catalyze additional up days. Some of them may be very large as the Fed opts for a ""shock and awe"" campaign. Don't be shocked or awed. Get ready to use the opportunity to sell. The long term future is dismal.

Absent money printing, there will be a very large decline in stock prices. We do not yet know the timing. If the decision is to print more money, as is likely, stocks will rise when looked at in nominal terms. However, the Fed will lose so much credibility that the value of the dollar will be greatly impacted. For that reason, a significant delay in making that decision will probably occur. Stocks must fall first, and the techniques they are now using must be proven to be a definitive failure.

It is prudent to use these artificial rally days to get out before the big decline that spurs the Fed into renewed money printing. Then, you can get back in, or choose an alternative investment that will benefit more from the loss of Federal Reserve credibility.",finance,1440730073
personalfinance,What are the benefits/downsides of married couples have separate credit cards?,"Hello all,

My husband and I are 25 years old and full time students/workers trying to get our finances in order.  We have a bit of credit card debt and are trying to figure out how best to deal with it while we can.  I have about $1100 on an american express card that is off of my parents credit account, so they are the main credit card authority on that and I just have a branch off card with them.  He has about $1700 on his capital one card with a 17% interest rate.  Our original plan is to take a big portion of our upcoming paychecks and pay off credit cards within 1-2 months, preferably sooner.  We're making some alright money, living rent free and want that off our back so we can focus on getting out own place and pay for school.  My parents have been advising me to get my own credit card for reasons;  to get off of theirs, to get my own so I can have one separate from my husband, and hopefully find a card with a low/no interest rate for a few months so I can pay off the big chunk and then just use it for gas and pay it monthly for the credit score.  I'm still doing research on that, I have no idea about APR's or any of that.    

This is leading to some other questions.  How important is it for a married couple to have separate credit cards?  Is it something we should be doing, doesn't matter, or definitely not do?  We discuss and deal with finances together so initially we thought one credit card to share but my parents seem to think that we should have our own.  Should I roll over the debt, pay it off and then cancel the card?  Should I keep a separate account and use it to build credit?  Or should I just have a card under my husbands credit card account and use that?

Thanks for any advice and I'll answer any questions you might have.",finance,1440730313
personalfinance,Recently had a traumatic experience that gave me the opportunity of a lifetime.,"Back in 2012 I was involved in a terrible car accident, my pelvis was shattered in 12 places and one of the pelvic shards severed my urethra. Both of my legs were broken along with 7 broken ribs, broken wrists, collapsed lung and countless other injuries.

I was bedridden for 5.5 months and it took about another year to learn how to walk and be able to live on my own again. I was obviously also catheterized for a year and a half so i had a lot of daily troubles and common annoyances(to put it mildly).

During the rehabilitation process i had an idea to make something to help alleviate a ton of pain, while also creating a much more sanitary environment for the catheter. I created a prototype and used it on myself and i loved it. I know from experience i can help ease tens of thousands of people of their pain and for me that would mean the world. Its been a rough few years for me and it would really feel like it finally came full circle.

I have spoke with my surgeons, some of whom are the best in the world. They themselves think i really have something here. I don't want to get into what it is for obvious reasons.

What im here for is guidance, Its a bit overwhelming being a 21 year old and having spent the last few years engulfed in the medical community. Now im sitting here, healthy as fuck finally, with an idea that i believe can make a huge impact on the world. I just dont know where to turn, we begun trying to make some designs but theyre just not professional enough. Do i go overseas? or stay in USA so i can slap on ""made here at home in the USA"". IDK WTF to do

Due to the extensive injuries from my accident the lawsuit im involved in is still not over.(1.4m in medical bills) There was a separate lawsuit against the driver just to help cover medical bills a portion of that went to me. So from that I have a decent amount of startup money to put into the product.

My lawyer who is a super-lawyer almost every year promised to help point me in the right direction. Which im very thankful for. Im assuming hes going to get me in contact with the right attorneys and meeting with our urologist about seeing where we can take this.(forgot to mention he pointed me to these guys to repair my urethra)

personalfinance,Personal Finance 201,"My birthday is in 40 minutes and I've been drinking and playing Halo all night. For some reason, this has given me some inspiration to make this post. Here's some bullet points of what I've learned over the past few years that isn't discussed too much here in /r/PF.

1. When making a decision on whether or not to buy luxury items, convert it to an hourly wage. ""Hmmmmm, this video game costs $60. I make $20 an hour at work. Will I get more than 3 hours of enjoyment out of it?"" If yes, make the purchase.

2. Similarly, assign an hourly wage to effort you put in to maintain frugality. If you make $20 an hour and spend 3 hours clipping coupons for the grocery store to save $15, it's probably not worth the effort. Your time can be spent elsewhere.

3. Increasing your income is easier than you think. /r/PF typically focuses on expense reduction. This is great and a critical part of personal finance. But, increasing your income is not impossible! Think outside the box. I personally earn around $700 - $1000 a month passively through a combination of the below bullet points.

* Credit card churning (/r/churning). I regularly make $100 - $500 in a month from doing this.
* Credit card rewards. Separately from churning, it's possible to earn between 2% and 5% cash back on credit    cards using rewards intelligently. I earn $20 - $80 a month doing this.
* buying websites (Flippa.com). I currently net $300 - $400 a month for a blog i bought for $2.85k.
* drop-shipping items from Alibaba to Amazon
* Lending on LendingClub. Even asking for a raise at work. I will teach you to be rich gives great advice on how to approach this.
* Credit Unions. Some hard searching will often yield high interest rate savings or checking accounts. I earn about $25 a month from this.
* Dividends. This is an obvious one. I earn $300 - $400 a month from these.
* Participating in medial studies.
* Online surveys. I actually think these are a waste of time, but they work for some people!
* US Equities tender offers. Fairly often, companies will get acquired via a tender offer. 

&gt; In corporate finance, a tender offer is a type of public takeover bid. The tender offer is a public, open offer or invitation (usually announced in a newspaper advertisement) by a prospective acquirer to all stockholders of a publicly traded corporation (the target corporation) to tender their stock for sale at a specified price during a specified time, subject to the tendering of a minimum and maximum number of shares.

Many of these tender offers have advantages for odd lot shares that you can take advantage of. I have made transactions that have netted over $1k literally risk free by participating in these.


4\. Passive income is king. When I see $1000 in my account, I don't think ""Great, I've got an extra $1k saved!"" I think ""Great, I've got some extra income of $2 - $8 a month."" As I've mentioned above, there are many many ways to put your money to work.

5\. Frugality is about value, not saving money. I see a lot of posts here about people taking pride in going to such extremes as having 0 cars for the entire family. This is great for some people, but I don't think it's worth the sacrifice for most. For example, I bought a new Toyota Corolla in 2008 for $16000. Today, it's probably worth $8000. So, I've paid about $1200 a year (plus gas and insurance) for the privilege of owning a car. It saves me at least 30 minutes to drive to work vs. biking. And I earn approximately $100 an hour. And I work approximately 250 days a year. So I theoretically earn $12,500 per year in ""hourly wages"" by driving this car vs. biking. That's almost the entire cost of the car each year.

personalfinance,"(AUS) Have been offered a 2.9% p/a balance transfer by citibank, not sure how to calculate.","I have two credit cards, one with a $20k limit and the other with a $40k limit. I have run into a few unfortunate circumstances with family (my mother had to undergo an urgent surgical treatment that cost $33K) which has placed a heavy burden. I have had these cards for many years with no issues.. never really owed much on them but have had them for these circumstances. I am now playing catch up and need help organising and reevaluating my debt. So to sum it up please see below:

- My $20K card is maxed out and interest is at 14.9%
- My $40k card (citibank) is currently at $20k Balance at 20 %
- Citibank has offered me a 20K balance transfer (the remainder of my available credit) at 2.9% per annum for 24 months. 
- My current payment hierarchy with citibank is payment will be allocated to lowest interest payable. I have an option to change this to highest interest payable. 
- There are no early payout fees should I pay it all off. 
- I don't have a home loan or any other loan. Have paid my car loan completely. 

I am thinking of transferring the $20k that I owe on the other card onto the citibank at 2.9% per annum (there's a minimum monthly payment applicable), and changing the hierarchy to payments made towards highest interest rate.   I am able to pay roughly $1500 a week towards the credit cards. 

Is this the wisest way to approach this? What will happen with the minimum payments required when I pay this $6k a month, it would be going towards the exisiting $20k that I owe citi as it incurs the highest interest. 

I'm sorry I'm not that well versed with Credit Card rules.

p.s. at the end of the 24 months the 2.9% will revert back to 20.9%. However I intend on paying all of this off in the next 12 months. I don't foresee any other big expenses in the near future.

personalfinance,Tax Ramifications of Student Loan Payoff,"Hi everyone, welcome to my first personal finance question!

Firstly, apologies if this or something similar has been posted before. I did a cursory search and couldn't find quite the info I was looking for, but if there is another post that could help, please link me!

So I, like many others, had no idea how loans work when I went to a very expensive private college in the NE at 17. My parents and I agreed to split my tuition evenly three ways, though I'm fairly confident I have much more debt than both of them. Which is fine, it was my education after all. All in all, I owe approximately $50k in student loans, split between the devil incarnate Sallie Mae/Navient and federal loans.

Now here's my question. My maternal grandparents are loaded. $50k would basically be pocket change to them. However, they are very frugal (*some could say miserly - but hey, that's how an Irishman who came to America with ""$200 in his pocket"" became a millionaire, but I digress*) so they would never offer to just pay my loans off as a gift. 

I am going to propose to them that they pay off my loans themselves, and then I would essentially sign a notarized contract/agreement that states I will pay them $200 monthly in repayment. This will cut my monthly payments in half and would be a huge help, since I am now paying about $500/month and I live in one of the most expensive cities in the States. I get by just fine now, but this would be helpful.

I know they'd be willing because they helped my Mom buy a house and basically have the same arrangement.

Now - here's my question. I've heard there can be tax ramifications for paying off loans in one fell swoop. Changes in income and all that. **Can someone explain how this works and/or what this would mean when tax season comes around?**

Also, is there anything missing in this arrangement that I should consider first?

I'm admittedly a finance novice - I just autopay my bills and save just to travel, and then don't think about it - so any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks Reddit xx

Edit: they probably will charge me some interest, just a very low rate. I figure I will leave that up to them, but presumably it'll be much lower than the 7% interest I'm paying now...",finance,1440770769

personalfinance,Recently got a full-time job. Trying to pay down debt. Please advise.,"Hi folks, I'm new to reddit. Looking for some help/advice on budgeting and paying off debt. My finances look a little dismal despite my new job, and I'm trying really hard but am having difficulty prioritizing what to pay off, how much to pay each month, etc. I made some poor financial decisions over the last few years and was basically living on credit and now am paying the price.

Here's a glimpse:

* After taxes, I'm taking in about $1600 a month 

* My rent is $500 a month, additional living expenses (utilities, groceries) are averaging about $250 a month 

* My car insurance payment is $88 a month

* I have two credit cards, one through Chase (Southwest Rapid Rewards) with a balance of $2900 and one through US Bank that has a $2000 balance. I don't know the interest rates off the top of my head.  

* I'm also paying off a $3000 loan from my father at about $100 a month, which is flexible and no interest, but he also has medical bills to pay so I really need to make sure he gets at least that much a month. I have $2600 remaining to pay back.

* Last but definitely not least, I have student loans. It's a DIRECT Consolidation loan for $20,100. I'm on PAYE and because I made so little last year, I'm making $0 monthly payments but it's just sitting there accruing interest while I pretend it doesn't exist. 


Currently I'm trying to prioritize the credit cards and put $100 on each credit card every time I get paid, but that doesn't leave me with much cash for everything else. I have absolutely no savings and am living paycheck to paycheck. Am I doing the right thing trying to pay these off first? Should my priorities be elsewhere?",finance,1440775687
investing,Pay off debt or invest,"I know what the obvious answer is, to pay off debt, but let me explain. 

29 year old long term investor with 401k already maxed well past what my company requires for a match and with an emergency fund saved up

I have $10k remaining on my car loan with a low interest rate of 2%. I have been paying well over the minimum ($200) for years. The way the bank is set up that I have the loan through, when I pay over the minimum, it pushes back my due date for my next payment. Right now my next payment is not due until May of 2016.

A) keep paying over the minimum until it's paid off

personalfinance,Need advice about a personal loan.,"Long story short, I totaled my car unfortunately. I am looking for a low-cost replacement (under 5 grand). Sadly, insurance only provided me with approx. $750 after deductible and prior damages.

I have found a good replacement for around $3,000, I was approved by my bank for a $5,000 personal loan at 9.49%.

However, last year I had a motorcycle accident and still have medical bills from that hanging over my head on payment plans ($75/month for hospital ($1800 left, still looking for interest rate if there is any), $75/month for Ortho ($400 left, no interest per month) and $45/month for General Practitioner ($180 left, no interest per month).

At the current 9.49% and $5,000 for 48 months my loan payment would be approx. $126/month.

At the current 9.49% and $3,000 for 36 months my loan payment would be approx. $90/month.

Would it be ill advised to take the full 5 grand for 4 years and use it to buy a car AND pay off a good chunk of medical debt (saving me $$ every month). Or should I only take what I need for the car?

I should also add, due to the accident/medical bills/live in fiancee and I splitting I was forced to move home with my parents. So I have no rent (yes, I've offered) and less bills than normal. So taking on the additional monthly payment for the full five grand would not be a major burden.  Also, the car is a necessity, I commute 45 minutes to work on the interstate, so public transit and/or a bicycle is not a viable option.  Right now I'm riding my motorcycle everyday, and it will get cold and nasty sooner rather than later.

Because the cars are of such low value he only accepts cash. And he deals with people on craigslist a lot too, so he's not taking any type of check.

personalfinance,"Home loan lender baited and switched me, now I already paid hundreds of dollars in fees and they are raising my rates. What is my best recourse here?","My fiance and I are shopping for our first home, we are bringing $9,000 to closing and the seller is paying 1k of our closing costs.

We shopped around for the best rate in a lender. One lender BoA offered us a 4.25% interest rate rate with 9k due at closing. This was our lowest interest rate under 10k at closing so we took it and paid them $520 to do an appraisal. 

I asked this lender in email, before we paid $520:

""Does this 9k at settlement take into account that we have already paid 2110 in earnest money? The earnest money gets rolled into that 9k correct?""

To which he responded

""Yes this already has the $2K accounted for. ""

Fast forward to today, our conditional approval date, and they can't approve me on the grounds that I only have 7k in the account that they are checking to see if I have the down payment in. I already paid the earnest money out of this account, so it had 9k, with that 2k already paid in mind.

Today the lender says, that 9k did not include the earnest money being rolled in. In order to only bring 7k to close, we'll need to change our interest rate to 4.75%.

I'm furious, and I feel scammed. Almost every lender I checked before committing that $520 was a better offer than this. I have no idea what to do next. I'm tempted to completely cancel with this lender and call my bank and try to back charge the outrageous appraisal fee but I'm not sure if that will work. I've never lost a dispute over a charge with my bank, but I think if I was going to lose one this might be it since they did an appraisal already.

The seller/title company gave us an additional week to secure a conditional loan approval for $500 in option money that I will be paying next week.

Bitcoin,"More and more people are ready to think critically about money. The approaching economic devastation is real, and your words may help forge the new middle class.","These days I make it a point to talk to at least two new people a week about cryptocurrency.  
  
I don't make it sound like a multi-level marketing scheme and I certainly don't try to sell them on bitcoin.  Instead, I just ask them to start researching terms like ""cryptocurrency"" and ""bitcoin"".  
  
Typically I ask them about their investments: real-estate, stocks, IRAs.... the signs of a bubble to me are that it seems that *everyone* has some kind of great investment these days.  Last time that happened was around 2007.  
  
Anyway, they are scared.  And they should be.  Regardless of their job, they understand something isn't right.  They can see the fraud and cracks in the system.  Even they understand that things are going from bad to worse and with no interest rates left to cut we have no way to cushion any kind of economic fallout - not if - but **when** it happens.  
  
They are all ears for a discussion about the exact nature of money.  Nick Szabo's essay about the money that Early America used is invaluable here.  Most have never heard of the term ""wampum"" and are surprised to learn that for the first 60 years or so the colonies subsisted on it as a form of money.  
  
Discussions about the advantages and drawbacks of gold typically happen after that, and then some wonder about what the *future* of money will look like.  Few will argue that this perpetual debt bubble we are trapped in can continue and they are quick to see that on the matter of the dollar collapsing: ""Objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear"".  
  
Now enter bitcoin and cryptocurrency: Explain it in no uncertain terms and pull the ol' Abe Lincoln... explain exactly why it's the stupidest thing ever... *but is also the future of money itself*.  
  
In 2009 we started this new experiment: cryptographic numbers on a computer as a store of value.  Initially they were worthless as they should be.... numbers on a computer right?  This is the fun part where you realize most people aren't even *aware* of bitcoin's meteoric rise from 10 cents each to $1000 each... and you can see their eyes get as big as saucers as you tell them about each time bitcoin ""crashed and died"".  
  
-------------------------  
  
Leave them wanting more.  Explain that you are really involved in this stuff, and you don't want them to think you're trying to sell them on it: You want them to investigate it and decide for themselves.  No company or government owns bitcoin: it's literally just computers competing to solve math problems all over the world.  Except every time one 'wins' it gets a little bit of free bitcoin and validates the ledger.  
  
Crypto is the greatest advent of money in a long, long time and will likely change the world.  Finish with a famous quote from Eric Hoffer: ""In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.""

personalfinance,I'm (30m) soon to be a green card holder and need advice regarding employment status &amp; taxes.,"Hi PF! My situation if a bit convoluted and after doing a lot of reading online about it, there are still some things that aren't very clear. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. Any advice is welcome and appreciated!

I currently live outside the U.S and work for a company that has an operations base in my country as well as several U.S states including official HQ in California.

My current employment status is that of a salaried employee and I'm taxed according to my country's rules, all is good.

I will be moving to the U.S soon and will become a green card holder through marriage (my wife is american).

I was able to negotiate a tele-commuting agreement with my current employer ensuring that I'll be working from home after I move stateside. 

Because we're moving to a state where the company has no operations, they would have to incorporate in my state, solely for my benefit which they would like to avoid (understandable, I think).

Their counter is to make me a 1099 employee rather than a W-2. Now, I think I understand all of the pros and cons here, including having to pay taxes quarterly, higher SS rate, no access to benefits, etc.

With this in mind I'm negotiating a figure that would ""make me whole"" after losing all benefits, and I'm aware that this higher figure will also mean a higher tax burden so I'm trying to take that into account as well. I agreed to relocate for my current salary so as long as it nets out the same I'm happy.

All this said, I thought that a potential alternative could also be to stay employed outside the U.S, work from home (in the US) and essentially continue business as usual (only change is that I would have to transfer money periodically into stateside accounts).

So my main questions are:
Would this be legal? I'm still claiming residence in the U.S and actually fulfilling that completely.

What are the tax implications of this arrangement? Can I claim the foreign earned income tax exclusion if I live in the U.S? (max is 95k I think). I would still be paying taxes abroad so I'd hope to avoid double-taxation. How does this work in terms of federal vs. state taxes?

What are the implications of essentially being ""unemployed"" in the US, that is, not being employed by a U.S company. Will this affect my credit or something else I'm not thinking of?

NOTE: I also understand that 1099 classification is not necessarily up to the employer/employee, but it's a tricky situation since the company has essentially accommodated my decision to move, at their expense (telecommuting isn't really a thing and I'm the sole exception) and so I want to meet them halfway and come to amicable terms.

personalfinance,I am getting the runaround with a collection agency and two credit bureaus. What is my next step?,"1. Medical bill of $72.03 gets sent to wrong address.
2. I don't know about it until six months later when I have it on my credit report.
3. Immediately pay bill (for crying out loud it's only $72.03).
4. Explain to agency that this should not have been on my report. I submit three documents showing proof of address at the time. They agree and send it off to the bureaus to be **removed**.
5. Agency says I have to wait 90 days for it to show.
6. 90 days passes. All three still show it as open.
7. I call the agency and they say that I have to file a claim with the bureaus.
8. Painstakingly do so.
9. One month later I get responses. Experian has removed it, while the other two simply mark it as paid. Now I am super frustrated. Obviously they had to contact the collection agency, so I don't get how one of them got it right but not the other two.
10. I call the agency and speak with a woman who says I didn't need to file those claims as they could have taken care of it. She says to give 30 days for it to go through again.
11. 60 days pass and it's still the same. I finally call the agency last week and speak with the same guy who's been managing my account and he says this is my responsibility and not theirs. After a long talk he finally agrees to send me a letter in the mail showing proof that it should be removed so I can have it to file the claims all over again.
12. I get the fucking letter today and all it says is the account should be marked as paid, and not removed.

What do I do? I absolutely fed up with this $72 bill hurting my 750 credit score. I'll file the claims again but I still don't have any guarantee that it will go through. I'm not about to let this slide at all.

Thanks for the help.",finance,1440874082
personalfinance,Is this Amazon visa rewards card a good idea for me right now?,"There is a good chance I won't be approved, but it might be worth a try. I absolutely trashed my credit score when I was 18 and I'm looking to start fixing it. As soon as I get my credit report in the mail I'm planning on looking at managing my small debts that show up on the report, (just a few things like DWP, the library, a router never returned to ATT, an eviction, a lot of stuff like that I let build up to a big mess) but in the mean time, I've been told I need to start building good credit. I'm definitely responsible and financially stable enough at this point in my life (I'm 25) to start putting small things, like my cell phone bill, on a card and paying it off every month. But I have no idea what I should be looking for in a credit card (aside from low interest rates, but I don't plan on paying any interest, because I intend to pay the whole balance every month), where I should get a card, or if anyone will even give me one with my extremely bad credit. I wish I could tell you more about my credit score, but I haven't looked at it in 5 years, I can't remember the number, but I do remember being in the bottom 5th percentile of Americans. So that's not good. But that's another post for another day when I get mine in the mail.

Anyway, I keep seeing advertisements for this Amazon visa card when I'm doing my internet shopping. Here is what they say about the card: 

""Amazon.com Rewards Visa Card from Chase.

Seems like a good deal to me, and I'm not gonna lie I'm tempted by the $70 gift card. But is this even a good idea for me right now? I'm nervous for some reason. And if I don't get approved with my really bad credit, where can I turn to get a card that will help me start building good credit?",finance,1440875183

crypto,Anonymous sending/receiving through a set of nodes?,"Most VPN's use a central server that has messages take paths from sender -&gt; server -&gt; receiver.  VPN hides the ""sender"" from the receiver, but if the VPN is hijacked, the sender's identity is compromised.

I've been brainstorming on an idea that makes the sender anonymous to all parties.

Let's say we have a private network of *N* nodes, made of users and servers.  My idea is that we generate *X* subsets of *n* nodes.   The message we want to send is then split into *X* parts and uniquely assigned to each subset.  Each message part will traverse it's subset of nodes sequentially, until it arrives at it's final node.  The final node will be our controlled server that recombines the message and sends it to the destination.

There are several features that will help cloak the originator of a message:

* Nodes should only know their next destinations to send the message part.
* Message parts will be IP Spoofed (using UDP) to hide previous node in subset sequence.
* Nodes should not know their position in the subset sequence.
* Subset sequence length should be unknown to each node.
* Subsets of nodes are regenerated for each new message.
* Controlled server will reverse the subset sequence to get back to originator.
* Controlled server should not know the subset sequence just how to reverse it.
* Encrypted sequences will be salted with *z* false nodes.

The difficult part is encrypting the sequence in each message part, but the message part would look something like:

&gt; BEGIN
&gt; 
&gt; ENCRYPTED MESSAGE PART
&gt; 
&gt; FAKE NODE (1)
&gt; 
&gt; FAKE NODE (2)
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; FAKE NODE (z-randomnum)
&gt; 
&gt; NODE (1)
&gt; 
&gt; NODE (2)
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; NODE (n)
&gt; 
&gt; FAKE NODE (randomnum)
&gt; 
&gt; FAKE NODE (randomnum+1)
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; FAKE NODE (z)
&gt; 
&gt; END

This type of system may be magnitudes slower than conventional VPN.  The node data will be encrypted using public keys from a database of active users that may be used as carriers.  

Is it feasible to encrypt the nodes using public keys that are not identifiable to a particular node?  Is this system as a whole feasible? Tear it apart please.",cryptocurrency,1440882827
politics,"O'Malley: ""...is our responsibility to ensure that Americans who put in a lifetime of hard work are able to retire with the dignity they deserve,”","""Our parents and grandparents should be able to retire in dignity—not poverty. Yet today in America, too many retirees are struggling to make ends meet. At the same time, the economic pressures on millions of families—from stagnant wages and high housing costs, to a lack of affordable childcare and skyrocketing college tuition—have resulted in meager, if any, retirement savings for tomorrow’s retirees.""

--

""A number of Republican presidential contenders have called for reducing Social Security benefits, either by raising the retirement age or privatizing the program.""

--

""O'Malley and Sanders both fund their proposals by making income above $250,000 subject to the payroll tax. Currently, wages up to $118,500 are subject to Social Security payroll taxes, but wages above that point are not.""

--

""Social Security is only projected to be able to pay all promised benefits until 2034, after which it will be able to pay approximately 75 percent of those benefits. Nearly two-thirds of seniors rely on the program’s benefits for most of their income, and the same is true for an even higher percentage of former workers with disabilities.
...

[Hillary's] comments on Social Security in this election cycle are notably different from her remarks on the issue during the 2008 presidential race, when she criticized then-Sen. Barack Obama for offering a proposal similar to Sanders' in which income over $250,000 would be subject to the payroll tax.

At the time, Clinton said that she was ""certainly against"" Obama's plan, because she didn't ""want to raise taxes on anybody.""""

--

From the whitepaper:

As president, Governor O’Malley will:

- Increase Social Security benefits for all retirees—both today’s and tomorrow’s. Governor O’Malley supports immediately boosting monthly benefits in a progressive manner for all retirees. Social Security was intended as a supplement to individual savings and pensions, but today, one in five married couples, and nearly half of unmarried individuals, rely almost exclusively on Social Security checks to survive. More than two-thirds of Americans near retirement will not have enough savings to maintain their current standard of living.

- Strengthen Social Security’s long-term fiscal outlook. The solvency of Social Security is not in crisis: Social Security has adequate funds to pay full benefits through 2034. But to pay for expanded benefits, Governor O’Malley supports lifting the cap on the payroll tax for workers earning more than $250,000. In addition, Congress should implement policies to lift the wages of all workers, which will make meaningful contributions to Social Security’s long-term balance sheet. This includes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and enacting comprehensive immigration reform.

- Ensure Social Security benefits are sufficient to keep retirees out of poverty. The immediate future is dire for many Americans nearing retirement: one in five Americans has no retirement savings at all. To keep seniors out of poverty, Governor O’Malley supports increasing the special minimum social security benefit to 125 percent of the poverty line for Americans who have worked at least 30 years.

- Increase Social Security benefits for minimum wage- and lower-income workers. As wealth inequality continues to widen and traditional middle class jobs prove harder to come by, Governor O’Malley supports adjusting “bend points” in the formula to give minimum-wage and lower- and middle-income workers more financial security.

- Prevent benefits from eroding over time. Governor O’Malley supports using the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners (CPI-W) to determine Social Security’s cost-of-living adjustments. The CPI-E provides a more accurate reflection of the higher cost of living for retirees than the current measure, which focuses on younger workers. Using the CPI-E will ensure that benefits do not erode for future generations of retirees.

- Reform Social Security to support, rather than penalize, caregiving. Governor O’Malley supports providing up to five years of “caregiver credits” that would increase the 35-year wage base for those who spend an extended period of time providing fulltime care for children, elderly parents, or other dependents. In practice, current methods of calculating benefits penalize workers, most often women, who take extended time off to care for their families.

- Reject efforts to raise the Social Security retirement age. Governor O’Malley believes that raising the retirement age is a back-door way to cut benefits for lower-income workers. It harms these workers in two ways: by forcing them to delay retirement in jobs that are often physically difficult, and by reducing lifetime payouts compared to wealthier retirees, who live five years longer on average than their lower-income counterparts.

- Dramatically expand access to employer-based retirement plans. Half of all workers do not have access to a retirement plan. Among part-time and low-income workers, roughly seven in 10 lack an employer-based retirement option. Governor O’Malley would require employers with more than 10 employees to process an automatic employee contribution to an IRA for all employees, at a level determined by the employee (who would have the option to opt out).

- Raise wages so all workers can afford to save. Since millions of hardworking Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck and struggle to save for retirement, raising the minimum wage and other wage policies are also critical to ensuring that today’s workers can retire with dignity and security in the future.

- Reject efforts to privatize Social Security. Governor O’Malley views proposals to privatize Social Security for what they are—a massive benefits cut that will gut Social Security, add to the federal debt, and leave future generations without the critical protections Social Security has provided for decades.

- Increase penalties for those who defraud our seniors. Older Americans are often targets for financial scams and exploitation, at an estimated cost of nearly $3 billion a year. The vast majority of frauds go unreported. Governor O’Malley will advocate for policies to protect our seniors from financial fraud, including laws to increase penalties for the financial exploitation of older Americans, laws to allow financial advisors to refuse or delay transactions where clients are being defrauded or exploited, programs to better identify and report financial exploitation among older Americans, and increased investment in prosecutors and advocates to go after elderly abuse.

- Fully implement the fiduciary rule. Under existing retirement advice rules, some brokers and financial advisers are allowed to sell Americans products even if they know they are poor investments. This conflict of interest, where advisers put their own bottom lines before helping their clients, costs workers saving for retirement $17 billion every year. President Obama has proposed a critical and commonsense rule to require those who give financial advice to put their clients’ interests first. Governor O’Malley will fully enforce this important fiduciary standard, protecting the retirement savings of millions of Americans and creating a level playing field for the many investment advisers who already act in their customers’ best interests.

- Make affordable, high-quality long-term care a national priority. Americans’ longer lifespans are outpacing our ability to provide quality and affordable long-term care. Although seven out of 10 Americans will need home care at some point in their lives, many Americans and their families struggle to afford it. Nine out of 10 people who provide long-term care are women, while home care workers are underpaid, overworked, and lack important benefits and protections.


--

""There are three aspects of O'Malley's plan that arguably make it a bit more ambitious than Sanders's.

-immediately boosting monthly benefits in a progressive manner for all retirees.

-caregiver credit: Sometimes people work fewer years pre-retirement because they drop out of the workforce to care for their children, or elderly or disabled relatives. As it stands, this reduces Social Security benefits, just because it means you worked less. O'Malley would give people credits that increase their lifetime earnings, for Social security purposes, for up to five years in which they were caretakers. This effectively boosts benefits for parents, women especially, who dropped out and back into the workforce upon having children.

-[A] mandate that all employers with 10 workers or more have their employees all contribute to an IRA by default.""

--

""If one judges such proposals by its critics, O'Malley's plan is looking good. An almost immediate broadside came from Third Way, a self-described ""moderate,"" ""centrist"" think tank that we've described in the past as little more than a Wall Street front. (By my count, of its 32 board members, 25 have had ties to Wall Street firms, the investment industry more broadly, or industry.)

Third Way attacked O'Malley's plan as ""political pandering at its worst"" and described it as ""heaping superfluous benefits on Lexus-driving retirees in Palm Beach.""""

personalfinance,Should I refinance my mortgage?,"When I went to purchase my first home a year and a half ago at 20, I had my credit pulled too many times in a short period of time (two homes fell through after inspection after my credit was already pulled.)  This dropped my credit score two points below where it needed to be to get the next lower tier interest rate.  FML...So here is the current breakdown of my situation.  As of this month my current house payment totals $631.48, with only about 91$ going towards the principal.  This is including taxes and insurance.  My unpaid principal balance is $70,512.81 with an interest rate of 5.125%.  Current interest rates are roughly 3.757%  The maturity date of my loan is 04/44.  I am wondering what my best approach is assuming I have 10k to put towards the principal if I rolled the refinance fees into the new loan.  I am very comfortable with my current mortgage payment so refinancing is not necessary for me but I believe it will be beneficial in the long run.

2) Shanghai stocks have bounced back, up 10% from low.

4) US economy grew almost 4% in Q2, far above expectations.

finance,Question about Interest Rates and its effects on the economy,"I recently read this: 

""These changes can affect both inflation and recessions. Inflation refers to the rise in the price of goods and services over time. It is the result of a strong and healthy economy. However, if inflation is left unchecked, it can lead to a significant loss of purchasing power.

To help keep inflation manageable, the Fed watches inflation indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI). When these indicators start to rise more than 2-3% a year, the Fed will raise the federal funds rate to keep the rising prices under control. Because higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs, people will eventually start spending less. The demand for goods and services will then drop, which will cause inflation to fall.""

So from my understanding, the Fed will raise interest rates in the above scenario to reduce purchasing power --&gt; demand drops --&gt; inflation falls. 

However, in the previous paragraph, it states that if inflation is left unchecked, it reduces purchasing power. So why would the fed need to raise interest rates to control inflation? If unchecked inflation itself reduces purchasing power, wouldn't it eventually correct itself because the demand for goods would be lower?

Any insight would be appreciate.d Thanks!",finance,1440893464

personalfinance,I will be filing for Chapter 7 (it seems wise at this point). Would it make any sense for my wife to file jointly?,"Edit - tl;dr - because I rambled on, and on, and on going way off topic (sorry):

Second attempt.  My thoughts were pretty loose/free/nearly incoherent in my original post.  This is what I was getting at.


I have 70K in empty debt.  My credit has been wrecked for years as I was not making enough in the past to pay, and therefore didn't.  The math makes sense for me to file for Chapter 7 (at least from the standpoint of regaining any sort of semblance of financial stability in the least possible amount of time)**.  


My wife  is in a similar situation credit with one big difference -- she doesn't have much empty debt.  She also doesn't have the salary potential I do.  I  make decent money (85k/year), but with a family of three in Portland even budgeting tightly we are only able to put back around 700-800 per month, before adding any other bills.  


We financed a car 6-months ago, and watching her credit score go up from 520 to 605 made me realize we need to start building some financial stability ASAP.  My credit hit a wall at around 580 (there's a lot of bad debt/judgements/charge-offs/delinquent accounts so it makes sense).  We're both in our early... Ahem, mid-thirties.


In a non-community property state, would there be a benefit for me to take the hit?  My intuition tells me it might be sensible since it should be relatively easy to rebuild her credit.  The complicating factor is that, for the foreseeable future at least, she won't be making any money.  And, of course, we're married so any benefit we may get from her trying to her rebuilt credit will be moot unless she can claim my income.  Kind of a catch-22.  

What I'm really looking for:  would there be any conceivable benefit for us filing for bankruptcy jointly in this situation?  If there is, it's not obvious.    


**Looking to the future, I see no point in attempting to pay off these debts as there is little to no long term benefit in doing so.  Perhaps a sense of moral responsibility, but I'm more concerned with buying a house and providing for my family.  We need a savings account now, not five years from now, and certainly not being in the same place credit wise five years from now which is what would happen if I tried to stretch thin and pay it all off.  
-------------------------


I have no assets and ~70k in junk (revolving) debt, plus 15k in student loans.   Salary is around 85k/year (of course this kind of salary happened WAY WAY WAY after I had long forgotten about paying bills I absolutely couldn't afford). 


I'm not going to get into all the (somewhat laughable to me now) details regarding how I found myself here.  There were many factors, not the least of which was shortsightedness secondary to the vast overestimation of how smart I really was, or at least believed I was. I was just immature, irresponsible and had plenty of self imposed personal chaos throughout my twenties.


I have one judgement against me for 40k.  Another for 15k.  And likely another 15k of litigation pending.  This is all empty debt, ran up by myself, roughly half of which was to take care of my girlfriend and her son for nearly two years after she lost her job while I was still paying a mortgage payment (split with the now ex-wife) on the now empty house my wife and I had bought and couldn't sell.


All of which is insanity, so yes, I am dumb.


Most of this debt was acquired from approximately 2005-2010.  I haven't touched a credit card for close to six years.  Almost four years ago I got my shit together,  moved half way across the country and after being fired from a job I hated that treated me poorly, and found a job that paid a salary more commensurate with my education and vocation (I'm a software developer).


Three years ago, I met a girl, got married and we have a two year old now.  Things have calmed down.  It's just taken a while, and I'm finally ready to deal with some of this forgotten damage.


My wife has been a stay at home Mom thus far (God grant her just another few months of sanity), and I'm the only one currently working (she plans on using her GI bill to finish up her Bachelor's degree in the coming months).


I live on the west coast, so our rent is pretty high.  We were able to secure a car loan for around 15k at 14% interest (I'm still not sure how, I suppose it's a secured loan since they can come get the car if we don't pay).  That's the only debt we've taken on.  


Though I'm outside the median income for a family of three, I am well within qualifying for Chapter 7 by the means test.  If its a bad idea, I'm open to criticism.  But realistically paying off that kind of debt (other than my student loans, which I did get paid down to 12k or so before defaulting) doesn't seem very realistic compounded with trying to create a savings for retirement, my sons education, daycare when he goes back to school, rent, plus just a savings for a safety net should anything unexpected happen.  


What I'm really curious about is what kind of financial impact it would have if we both filed, or just me.  Both of our credit ratings were in the low 500 high 400 range before financing our car around 6 months back.  However (unlike me) she has little to no debt (maybe a couple thousand dollars) and most of that is outside the statute of limitations to collect, and will be falling off her credit report within a couple years -- or, WE JUST PAY THE DAMN BILLS - isn't growing up fun :)


As far as rebuilding our credit and being more sensible than we were in the past, would we benefit from only one of us filing?  Or both?  Is there any particular financial advantage/disadvantage 3, 5 or 7 years down the road for us taking either route?  


My thought is I file chapter 7, to wipe the junk loans and pay off everything she has outstanding.  This may be ill-conceived, however.  I admit that.  I obviously have no business managing money.  But with her collection accounts paid it seems like SHE might be able to get some revolving credit, just so WE can start building some savings/stability/peace of mind.  Would be incredibly helpful if anyone has been or known anyone in a similar situation.

I avoided asking if I should file.  It seems like a no brainer to me.  I understand that the bankruptcy will haunt me for, possibly 10 years.  But it can't get any worse than where I've been.  I think this kind of situation is what Chapter 7 was intended for.  I was stupid, but was also extended more credit than I could possibly pay back and had my interest rate hiked from 5% to 30% on a 28k balance while making 32k a year.  Thanks Obama.....

2. My gf has recently taken out a debt consolidation loan and paid off her 3 credit cards. We were discussing which 2 cards she should close and I figured it would be the two highest interest rates.

She is under the impression that since the card with the highest rate is her oldest account, that keeping that account open would be better for her credit rating. She has another card that still has 0% interest for another 8 months, and a lower interest rate with the same borrowing limit.

So is there any benefit in keeping the oldest and highest rate card open, for her credit rating?",finance,1440935648

I know there's probably some math equation that proves putting your money towards something is more lucrative than eliminating your debts sooner, but morally I just can't wrap my mind around this.

My payments will start in November.  $650/mo.  As of right now, all I pay is rent (a little over $800/mo), gas, gym, food, etc. per month.  Probably $1500 total, and my take-home is $3200.  I have nothing and have been spending this surplus on important things (bed, TV, dresser, etc.).

Don't even have cable though as I'm extremely minimalist.

My question is mainly ""how do I overpay my student loans?""  Do I have to contact the lender and inform them that I am paying more than what my balance is?  Or can I just send them an extra $1k/mo towards my account and it will get paid down like that?  I want to absolutely MINIMIZE my interest/payments here.

I also want to save as MUCH as I can *and* build passive income.  Main focus is paying down my student loans. After that, I'm not sure.  Invest in stocks? Bonds?  Real estate?!  I don't want this money to sit in a savings account -- I want it to work *for* me.

How much should I be making a year on my new job to match the pay of my old job after taxes?,"Right now I'm making 55k salary at my current job. One thing lead to another and a friend offered me a contract job for his new company. He said he'd offering me an equal salary to my current job to start off. According to his math, a 13% bump from 55k should net me the same after state and fed estimated taxes and health insurance. That's a $7,150 increase.

Now I'm not sure where he got that percentage from and I don't want to get screwed over. Health insurance is going to be around $300 a month out of pocket for me so that's just leaves $3,500 for taxes. That seems waaaay to low and feel like I'm going to be making far less when all said and done.

worldpolitics,The Global Financial Bubble is Propped Up With Cash From Government Central Banks - 'Capitalism's Dead-End',"31 August 2015

Early last week, global stock markets experienced their worst selloff since the 2008 financial crisis. At the opening of US markets on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 1,000 points, its largest intraday fall in history. By the end of the week, however, the markets in the United States and Europe had staged a major rally, recovering much of what they had lost.

The reason for the turnaround in global stock markets was not hard to find. As the New York Times put it: “Once again, the Federal Reserve helped save the day for investors” who were “inspired by soothing words from an influential Fed policy maker.” By “soothing words,” the Times means the promise of further infusions of cash into the financial system, which has fueled the continual rise in equity prices.

In particular, the Times was referring to the comments of William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a key ally of Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who said that the deterioration of the US economy made the case for raising interest rates “less compelling.”

Whether or not the Fed actually raises interests rates a small amount at its meeting next month, these statements were a pledge to do whatever it takes to keep the Wall Street asset bubble inflated.

The same day, European Central Bank Executive Board member Peter Praet made clear that the ECB stood ready to go even further by expanding its ongoing “quantitative easing” money printing operation. “There should be no ambiguity on the willingness and ability of the Governing Council to act if needed,” he declared.

These announcements compounded the moves by the Chinese central bank Tuesday to cut its target interest rate and reduce banks’ reserve requirements simultaneously, sending yet another flood of money into the economy on top of the 900 billion renminbi ($140 billion) it is estimated to have injected in June and July.

It is striking that, largely on the basis of a few hints dropped by monetary policy officials, the biggest global stock market sell-off since 2008 was at least partially reversed.

These developments underscore a basic reality of the contemporary capitalist economy: the ongoing stock market surge, which has seen all three major US stock indexes triple in value since 2009, is the product not any genuine economic “recovery,” but of continual infusions of cash from global central banks.

The present situation is the outcome of an extended process. Over the course of decades, the creation of wealth for the financial elite has become increasingly divorced from any productive activity and tied ever more directly to speculation in financial bubbles—a process most nakedly expressed in the United States. As Raymond Dalio, head of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund put it, “The money that’s made from manufacturing stuff is a pittance in comparison to the amount of money made from shuffling money around.”

Significantly, Dalio, whose wealth has tripled since 2008, this week called for the Federal Reserve to respond to growing turmoil in financial markets with a new round of quantitative easing.

In fact, so dependent has the global economy become on free money that former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers conceded in a column last week that, “Satisfactory growth, if it can be achieved, requires very low interest rates that historically we have only seen during economic crises,” concluding that “new conditions require new policies.”

Of course, the wealth of the financial elite cannot come from nowhere. Ultimately, the continual infusion of asset bubbles is the form taken by a massive transfer of wealth, from the working class to the banks, investors and super-rich. The corollary to rise of the stock market is the endless demands, all over the world, for austerity, cuts in wages, attacks on health care and pensions.

Nowhere are these processes more clear than in the US. In the aftermath of the 2008 crash, the Obama administration and the US Federal Reserve made trillions of dollars available to the banks and major financial institutions. As a result, the share of wealth held by the richest 0.1 percent of the population grew from 17 percent in 2007 to 22 percent in 2012, while the wealth of the 400 richest families in the US has doubled since 2008.

The same period has witnessed an unprecedented decline in the incomes of working people. According to the latest Federal Reserve survey of consumer finances, between 2007 and 2013 the income of a typical US household fell 12 percent. The median US household now earns $6,400 less per year than it did in 2007.

The threatened bursting of the asset bubbles is driven by concern that the easy money policy is reaching some form of denouement, that the ammunition of central banks is drying up. All the more ferocious will be the ruling elite’s assault on the working class, in the United States and internationally.

The ruling class responded to the recent crisis with a drive to vastly expand its own social wealth and privileges at the expense of the great majority of society. This drive will only intensify in the coming months and years. The working class must advance its own worked out program, based on an understanding of the forces that it confronts: a ruthless financial aristocracy, political institutions that are bought-and-paid for by the banks and giant corporations, and a global social system, capitalism, that has reached a historic dead-end.",finance,1441014634

I am currently having issues with my Private Wellsfargo Student Loans. I have been looking to consolidate them since I completed my degree August 2014. I have been living in South Korea and working as an English Teacher since August 2013 and completed my Bachelors Degree online after attending for 3 years on campus. I have Fafsa loans as well but this question concerns only my Private Wells Fargo Student Loans. I have a total of 5 through Wells Fargo with a current Total of $112,318.50 with a payment of $1,141.46 a month. I've been making the payment since October 2014, as I had taken a year off from school between my 3rd and 4th years. I have been in contact with them considering consolidation 3 different types, and applied three different times as well. Each time I have been denied for a different reason. The first time was my credit score, which I have since worked on and paid past hospital bills. The second time was according to them that my credit was maxed out however I do not have any other standing credit loans besides my Student Loans through Wells Fargo and FaFsa. The third time I was denied was due to me apparently not living in the U.S. even though I submitted a U.S. Permanent Address which is tied to the loan account, my banking information, in which my mother and grandmother currently reside. I called again a couple months later to confirm whether this was the case and got only an answer which told me to believe the last one even though they were not sure about it themselves. 

Before I try to apply again I wanted to know if anyone had any idea to the validity of not being about to consolidate due to not currently being within the country. Especially since the consolidation loan paperwork could be sent to me to finalize from my mother who currently resides at my listed permanent address. I would like to consolidate these 5 loans into one interest rate using a co-signer. I would also like to know any opinions about getting the loans consolidated into 1 by another company.

personalfinance,"PF, can we please get a bit of love for the snowball?","PF,

I have an issue with how discussions about the snowball method of paying off debt always wind up around here.  

Basically, someone will post that they've started -- or finished -- paying off a sizable debt using the snowball method, which suggests you pay off the smallest debt first, and then roll the money you were using to pay it off toward the next largest debt. Rinse and repeat. Someone always, always, always, comments with some version of:  

&gt; Congratulations! But, just so you know, you would be way better off using the avalanche method because it will save you money. Unless you need instant gratification or something.  

The avalanche method, of course, suggests that you pay off the debt with the highest interest rate first.

So I know this advice is technically true; paying high-interest debt first **will** save you money over time. But I have two issues with this conversation: 

1) My main issue with the snowball v. avalanche debate is that people tend to frame it by asking if OP is an adult capable of thinking ahead, or if they are a petulant child that needs constant positive reinforcement. I think that's ~~a bit~~ far too simplified. Importantly (for me, at least), they always leave out this point: By paying off a small debt quickly, you now have more liquid cash each month. And while you will be snowballing it toward other debts, it is available if you need it in an emergency, and it's not tied up in minimum payments elsewhere.  

2) It's true that the avalanche will save you money. But... How does that compare with the emotional benefit of paying debt off quickly, and (this is key) is it better to have more liquid cash each month?

As a personal example, I use [this spreadsheet](http://www.vertex42.com/Calculators/debt-reduction-calculator.html) for listing my own debts, which include a mortgage, a credit card, auto loans and student loans. Payoff using the snowball method will take 89 months; the avalanche method will take 88 months. And at the end of the whole thing, the avalanche will save me ~$400, which equates to less than $5 per month.  

But if I use the snowball method and pay off small debts first, I will have a $1,000 of liquid cash (which I plan to use as a snowball) within a year. Using the avalanche method, I won't have that much cash freed up for nearly two years.  

That could make a big difference in a pinch. For example, if I need to make a huge home repair, and need to replenish savings or pay off a card quickly, I would way rather have $1,000 a month to throw at it.  

tl;dr: There **are** benefits to paying off small debts first. Please stop pretending that there aren't.",finance,1441038819

Because this is a cost-conscious sub, I guess my question generally is when do you guys get fed up with a car nickel-and-diming you and just decide to get a new (or new used) one?  I, like many of you, hate these large expenses, but I have foreseen this one coming for a while. 

I have plenty in an emergency fund for both the repairs and for a down payment on a new used car, if I decide to go that route.  Thanks.",finance,1441044850
personalfinance,"Help with order of Priority for Debt, Emergency Fund, and Retirement with Baby on the way","Longtime reader and first time poster in /r/personalfinance.  I appreciate everyone's feedback/advice in advance.  I've learned a lot here over the past year!  

I feel this is a somewhat different scenario than the ""I have $10k what do I do with it"", and I'm not looking for someone to quote Dave Ramsey verses either.  I would describe my financial philosophy as something akin to a Devout Boglehead who enjoys expensive bourbon and other nice things.   

I'm 31, wife is 27 with our first child due in a few months.  I wanted to get a gut check of sorts on my current financial situation and order of priorities for the near and mid-term.  

Financially, we're able to do and prioritize just about anything (within reason) we choose.  We don't live an excessive lifestyle by any means, but recognize we are comfortable.  We've also worked hard and continue to work hard to keep it that way!  With a baby on the way, we've run the numbers and don't anticipate any significant changes in lifestyle including the added expenses of daycare and baby items.  This is a war gaming exercise for me to make sure that 1) I'm prioritizing the right things and 2) setting my family up for as much financial security as possible.  I think we've used debt responsibly when necessary and have made good decisions to balance lifestyle with sound financial decision making.  Maybe you all can help confirm/reject that premise!  

Our current situation:  
-Income is approx $175k gross combined.  Not boy band money, but appropriate medium sized bucks given our career paths, jobs, and level of effort.  

Debts:  
-$33k car loan @ 1.99%, $600/month payment thru May 2020 - it's a 2015 SUV that was ~$44k new and we're going to have for a long time.  Bought it new through wife's work program at about $5k off sticker price, and it's  a make model that doesn't get discounted often.  Since we're going to have it a while, I went against my strong desire to buy used so my wife and child can be the envy of the carpool line.  

-Our second vehicle is leased @ $350/month through July 2017 (it's electric (boogey oogey oogey) and the subsidies and gas savings covered the payment for the lease term, otherwise I never would have leased a car :-).  It replaced an aging German vehicle that was paid off, and the proceeds went towards a downpayment wife's new SUV to ensure we'd never be upside down on the loan...gotta love marriage)  

-$39k private student loan @ 5.00% fixed, $438/month payment (This was just refi'd from 9.5% with SoFi..private schools ain't cheap, and they remind you of that fact for a long time when you pay your own way through them.) 
 
-$26k fed student loans @ 3.62% fixed, $184/month payment (again, private schools ain't cheap)  

-$328k mortgage @ 3.75% fixed (just refi'd in April to 20 year term, house worth $385k+ and should continue to appreciate nicely)...we will be in the home long term barring unforeseen circumstances, chose 20 year term so it'll be ours when kids hit college in case we want to sacrifice our lifestyles to help them avoid a lifetime of crippling student loan debt...although, it seems to have served us pretty well.  PITI payment is ~$2460/month.  

Other relevant info:  
-$40k in savings right now

-Both maxing out our company 401k up to company matches (about $30k there thus far, growing at about 16k per year in terms of contribution)  

-Opened and maxed a Roth IRA for each of us in 2014 (about $10k there(...thanks Yuan!), will add $11k principal per year here as well)  

-Perhaps worth noting, credit scores are ~800 and we have about $35k in accessible credit...would prefer not to consider credit as an emergency fund though.  

We do want to get to the point where the following are possible in the next few years:  
-Pay cash for a $20-25k car in July 2017 when lease is up on car 2--I'm thinking a 3-4 year old Lexus that will give me 8-10 years of upwardly mobile driving.  

-Continue to maximize contributions to both 401ks up to our company match, and max out Roths for both of us
  
-Wife stops working to have additional children (or goes part time if she still wants to buy $150 worth of tablescaping decorations for each holiday), currently that would mean replacing or living without about 50k of our income...I have somewhat realistic career forecast that should help absorb at least half if not all of that income differential.  

-Maintain emergency fund of $25k if we're both working, ~$40k if she stops working.  We're both highly employable and in technology, but you never know...  

So, my question to you redditors...what should I prioritize over the next 2-4 years to give me options at all of the items above?  In general, my thoughts center around trying to reduce the monthly expenses (debts) to give some flexibility and/or accelerate my wife not having to work.  At the same time, with the interest rates where they are on the debts and the balances, I don't perceive a ton of benefit to giving up my cash or money for the roths vs. the monthly payment amounts I'd be saving.  While I realize, killing off the largest of the student loans is a guaranteed 5% return on our money, it's also the largest non-mortgage balance and getting it paid off in 2 years likely means not having the cash for a car in 2017.

Do I sit tight but keep adding ~$1000-1500/month of surplus to the emergency fund so I can pay cash for a car in 2 years?    


Do I throw some of the cash at the debts to reduce the monthly loan payments and then slowly replace that cash over the next few years so I can pay cash for the car in a few years?


Do I do either of the above, and then plan to buy a cheaper car?


Do I hire a wizard to cast a spell on my wife that makes her want to work until she's 70? (wrong subreddit???)


TL;DR - I have some money and will continue to make more of it for the foreseeable future.  I owe some of that money to debtors at reasonable and low interest rates.  I want to satisfy those obligations and buy a decent car for cash in a few years, I also want to enable some lifestyle choices for my growing family.

personalfinance,Can someone rate my short term plan and offer some feedback? (strategy for getting out of debt),"So I'm 23 years old and just got hired for a new job making a bit more money.  up until now I've more or less just been living paycheck to paycheck saving as much as I can.  With the higher income, I'd like to make sure that I'm making smarter decisions with the extra cash.

As of right now I have about $130k in student loans with a minimum payment of $900/mo and the highest interest rate being one loan with 8%.  I have $7k in savings and have been making the minimum payments as I was earning about $2k per month (varied).  I live with my parents so I easily had enough to pay the loans and put a bunch of cash away.  I finally got hired for a job in my field and am starting at $42-$50k a year (42k base up to 8k incentive, plenty of opportunity for overtime as well).

So here's what I think I'm gunna do.  On my start date in October I'm going to pay a large chunk of my 8% loan, around $5,000 dollars, leaving $2k in a savings account for emergency money and some growth - 2k is the minimum to triple the starting interest rate.  I'll continue to live with my parents for at least 5 more months and use my extra income to 

A. always keep at least $2k in savings
B. start contributing to a 401k - company matches
C. make significantly larger payments to my 8% loan

Depending on where I am 5 months down the road I might move into my own apartment with a friend or 2.

personalfinance,Maternity Leave Budget - Will Be Down 4k a month... Any miracle workers out therE?,"I am fairly new to Reddit and PersonalFinance, so feel free to direct me to existing help or feel free to solve all my problems in a beautiful, easy to understand answer below (pleaaaaaaase, haha).

Our pre-baby, 2 income, take-home income is $6600 a month and we have a savings of about 12k. 

We have $1200 in non-changeable expenses (combined house payment thing that has insurance in it and stuff, internet, energy and water bill) per month. A variable, but required expense is food - and we are totally open to budgeting tools to keep us fed (hoping baby is breastfed to save on formula and cloth diapers pre-bought before mat leave to save on diaper cost) and willing to make significant life changes to make it work.

Costs we are hoping we can reduce/change to accommodate during mat leave is $1000 in combined student loan payments. My husband is in school part time, so he should be able to defer, and if I am on disability with no income, I should be able to defer mine during mat leave as well, right? So, that's $1000 back a month. We also have $2k on a credit card, but have until November 16 to pay it off with no interest, and planning to return to work in August, so we are thinking of paying that off between Aug-Nov when we will have 2 paychecks again so no monthly payment there. We also plan to pay off our car ($450 back a month), and other no-interest gaining balances on small balances on credit cards (about $200 back a month). So, we are looking at reducing monthly expenses about $1700 a month during mat leave.

So, HERE'S WHERE I NEED YA - I want to take 4 months mat leave. I will not only lose my salary of $3340 a month, but also have to pay out of pocket $725 for insurance, etc. We are able to trim costs, hopefully, $1700 for those four months. According to my calculations, we are looking at living about $3100 less than what we are used to per month. Is that even possible?

If you are still reading (first, thank you) - maybe it would be easier to post my questions as bullets:

1. Is the above scenario plausible at first glance? 
2. I do not have a budget spreadsheet, because we spend a lot of money eating out and on house projects that range widely each month. We do manage to save money each month, but that also is widely variable in amount. How can we figure out how much sensible people spend to eat in one month? I hate cooking and if costs are comparable for two people, eating out a Chipotle or Subway 3-4 times a week is preferred.
3. How much would you anticipate that we'd have to dip into savings? Then, how much would you be comfortable having in savings with a newborn if we did have to tap in?

Thank you so much for any tips or insight you have to offer. Money and adulting are so hard. We are nervous for baby already, but I really want to have some time to bond with baby and learn to be a mom but I don't want us to get into money trouble as a result.",finance,1441054361
personalfinance,Legitimate refinancing option for my car.,"I will be the first to say this was a bad deal. Two years ago I had a clunker of a car that was not reliable and I was about to start a new job. I went to Ford because I liked how the Ford Focus looked. I ended up buying a 2013 Ford Focus SE. I was a bit less knowledgeable back then about financial choices. I am paying $450 a month at 11.5%. I know that is extremely high but I didn't think at the time I had other options. Now I owe around $17,800 on my car and I recently went into Ford to see what trade in value is and they told me $10,500. I walked out because I know my car is worth more than that. I only have 17,100 miles on the car, change the fluids myself and it's never had a scratch on it. I will say that the salesman said that I could refinance at any time and it wouldn't be a problem. I have tried to refinance since then 10-15 times with no luck through my bank and local credit unions. My credit score at this time is way better and I just bought my first home last week. I am trying to lower the monthly car payments so I can save more. My main question is are there any legitimate refinancing options to lower the payment and interest rate or am I screwed?",finance,1441055051

personalfinance,"I need help managing my $150,000 student loan debt.","Hello, my name is Stu. This is my first time ever posting with reddit. I am 22 and a recent graduate from UVM. In order to pay my out-of-state tuition, my father took out Parent Plus loans. This is where most of my student debt resides. These are federal loans in my dad's name, adding up to about $125,000. The rest are in my name. Those in my name are much easier to manage because they reflect my income (less than 20,000 a year) and my qualification for forgiveness plans. Those in my father's name reflect his income (about 50,000 a yr). Because of his moderate income, no matter how we seem to refinance, we are expected to pay about $1000/mo for around 25 years. This is an impossible burden. I feel less prepared for my life with this debt than I did before I started college.
Student loans cannot be discharged through normal bankruptcy, and I cannot find a group willing to refinance all the loans into my name. So far, the best option I've come across is Obama's Loan Contingency Plan. I spoke with coordinators for this plan that believe we could reduce all the loans down to about 120 payments (10 years) of 700/mo because my father works for a non-profit hospital. The outstanding debt after that time would be forgiven. Although this is slightly better, it is still unnerving to know I'll be personally paying, maybe at the very best, $350/mo for 10 years. If anyone can offer advice on how to manage Parent Plus loans, I would greatly appreciate it. I just want my life back.",finance,1441058925

He is offering to let me barrow $5,000 in which he is telling me I will just pay back to him when I have the money. He does not want any interest or anything out of this, he simply just wants to help me due to someone doing the same for him when he was in school.
