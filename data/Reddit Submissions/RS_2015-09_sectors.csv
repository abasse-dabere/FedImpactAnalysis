personalfinance,Medical Loan Debt - Best Way to Discharge,"So my wife has some medical school debt - $75K - for which we make monthly payments of about $650. 

Here is how the loan is spread -

1. 30K  at 1.5% (Navient)
2. 15K at 2.5% (this is through home equity LOC)
3. 30K at 3.5% (Navient)

Right now, we live below our means, living comfortably, and making regular usual payments.

However in the interest of dealing with this issue in the best possible manner....I wanted to deliberate over whether I should pay off like $10K lump sum for the highest interest rate loan which is 30K or pay it off full. Or perhaps take some other cheaper loan from the bank?

What do you guys think? While I wish we qualified for some sort of debt forgiveness since my wife is literally saving lives in the OR but I don't think she qualifies for any such program.",finance,1441068368
personalfinance,"Between my wife and I, we have $136k in student loans. How do we begin to tackle this?","First of all, I have a lot of regrets. I feel very stupid for taking all this on. I will not let my children make the same mistakes. 

My wife and I went to a private institution, she got a degree in education, I got one in social work. 

She has around $41k from that, I have around $64k. Hers are through Navient, and broken up into 8 loans with an average interest rate of 5.26%. I consolidated mine through mygreatlakes and they have a 5.75% interest rate. I made the choice to get my masters degree, and now have an extra $31k, also serviced through mygreatlakes with an interest rate of 6.21%.

I got a $9k raise after getting my masters, which still only gets me to $37k gross. My wife had a 1 year position last year, but this year was unable to get a full time job. She is subbing for $80/day. 

I have $7k in student loan reimbursement that I didn't end up using and is sitting in my bank account. I want to put that towards this stuff, but I'm unsure of where to put it or if it matters. 

I have no idea what to do. It doesn't seem possible to pay this off.",finance,1441068529

personalfinance,"Would a cash out refinance be a good option to pay off Car, CC and Student Loans?","First let me thank you for reading my post and any feedback that is provided.  I am in a little awkward situation and am considering a cash out refinance on my house in order to pay off other debt and lower my monthly payments.  It seems like a good option but I have a feeling I am overlooking something.

I gross around 95k a year but after taxes, 401k and company stock options I take home around 50k,  I put around 10% (matched at 6%) into my 401k each month and have the option to purchase my company stock at about a 30% discount which I take advantage of for about 7% of my gross pay. 

I purchased a house a little over two years ago at roughly 270k, at the time I put down about 13% of the homes value as a down payment, so I am currently paying PMI.  My monthly payments after taxes and insurance is about $1800 a month.  I got an interest rate of 3.75%. The house has increased value quite a bit since I bought it.  Similar sales are in the 360k range and keep going up, most house in the neighborhood go pending in less than a week. 

I recently purchased a new car for 32k and put down 8k. So I have an auto loan at 1.75% and pay roughly $420 a month.  

I have about $1k left on student loans and pay $70 a month at something like 6%.  

I usually put everything on my credit card and pay it off every month so I don't get charged interest and get points.  However these last few months there have been a few things that have come up and I can't seem to keep up with the charges anymore.  After purchasing the car my GF and I had a Europe trip which I put mainly on my card for about $3k.  Then I had to replace my air conditioner for about $3k.  Now after a storm I had to do home repairs for about $1.5k.  I just don't have the cash as I use to so it getting hard to keep up.  My CC is at about $3.5k and I have had to eat the interest two months in a row (although reward points have more than covered it).  It seems to be getting harder to keep up with the charges.  Would it be a bad choice to take some of my equity and pay off all of my loans so I can start saving again?",finance,1441084604
investing,Should I pay off my mortgage over the next 10 years or invest the money?,"I have $186k left on my mortgage at 4% interest rate.

worldpolitics,Why do I have a feeling that the sanctions on Iran will not be lifted?,"* USA has an inflation rate of 0.2%. USA's currency is too strong at the moment which is not a good thing due to the leading of deflation.

* Before China's currency devaluation: There is over production of crude oil that leads to the lowering price of oil. It will be cheaper for the US as they are the net importer of oil. the average american gets to save at least 700$usd per month due to low oil prices = Cheaper petrol. 

* Low oil price = Stronger $usd = Deflation

* After China's currency devaluation: The fed reserver was supposed to hike interest rate next month after a decade to counter deflation. But China is too fucking smart! The devaluation of China's currency further pushes the $usd to become more stronger. And of course countries who are net importers of manufacturing goods will most likely prefer to import goods from China (weak currency = cheaper) rather than importing from US (Strong currency = More expensive).

* So, knowing that US is going towards deflation, it is normal to counter this by lowering interest rate. But hey, the current interest rate in US is around 0.25% which is already low. So, the next step to counter deflation rate is to manipulate the oil price to make supply less than demand so that oil price will increase. 

* Increase oil price = increase petrol for american citizens

* They will have less savings so they have lower spending power which will slow down deflation. I dont know if it is good enough to increase inflation or will just slow down deflation because im not an economist. 


* So from my no-shame understanding, for the US, the current oil price is below the breakeven. Iran is going to mass export its commodity once the sanction has been eased thats going to further pushes the oil price down the drain. Isn't this detrimental to the united states?

I thought I might reach out to the Reddit community about what I can do. I had a severe allergic reaction in LA, and I drove to the allergist's office to get it checked out one morning. The doctor gave me medicine, and I passed out. They called the ER, and they brought me to Cedar Sinai hospital. I found out later that the allergist appointment, even though my insurance was accepted, it was out of network so I have a larger deductible. Meaning $400 in costs out of pocket. then the EMS cost was around $1,600. The overnight stay in the hospital incurred $10,000. So my questions are: 

1. How do financial hardship programs usually work? Do they base it off my income, or from my mother's, since I am her dependent? She makes close to the federal poverty level.

2. My insurance is a family plan insurance under my mother's. We have a $5,00 deductible. Meaning the hospital visit will be over $5,000 after insurance. Will the hospital's financial department see this, and make a case against giving us money? The fact we have insurance?

3. What if I don't pay? Are there ways to avoid payment until the lower the debt? My friend said this could be the case and that it wouldn't hurt credit scores?

personalfinance,Double Doctorate Debt - Invest versus Pay while deferred,"Hi All,

Thank you in advance for any advice.  I am increasingly anxious about my debt status and am seeking another opinion.

I worked through my entire undergraduate degree and came out debt free.  I enrolled in pharmacy school and couldn't keep up with the 10's of thousands required each semester.  I lived reasonably, but as of today I have $124,738.23 of debt.  This debt is split between seven loans each at 6.8%.  When I enrolled in pharmacy school I was under the impression that loan interest would not accrue while completing my subsequent PhD.  I've found this not to be true as I stare at 18,598.49 of purely interest.  I've been told a spectrum of things to do, from dad who says pay off the loan, to the school that says try to obtain loan repayment program, which I found out today I am not eligible to receive because I don't do enough clinical, to invest as your investment will compound faster than your student loan.

I've used the PMT function in excel =PMT((0.068/12),120,124738,0) to calculate a 10-year payoff would be 1435.49 per payment.  I've also done the calculation for a 20 year pay off and found my payment would be $952.17.  I'm not an extremely active trader, but I am trying to hit our ROTH maximum each year as I feel irresponsible not doing so.

Income:  my stipend - $32,500, spouse- $50,000

Outgoing:  Housing - $945, Food - $700, Transportation - $600, Healthcare - $100, Pets - $50, Misc - $150

I'm 28, I have another 2 years in school.  Based on my calculations we have about $1600 a month of flexible money.  Should I start paying down the loans that aren't subsidized, should I put money towards investing (I average 7%/yearly gains before taxes), or something else entirely?  Are there any programs that you'd recommend that might help me reduce my loans?  Should I ask my dad (current owner of my home) to take out a mortgage on the house to pay the loan to change my interest rate?

personalfinance,"Taking out Student Loans to finish in 2 years, or working and finishing in 4","Hello PF,

This is for my girlfriend, as she does not have an account. I never went through student loans so I am hesitant to give her advice as I have not been in those shoes before. Thank you for reading!

To keep everything short, she has the choice to either take out student loans and cram in her required units to finish college in 2 years (has spoken to counselors, they say that is doable) or she continues working full time (42 hrs at 13.50. No part time offers at current job) and finishes school in 4 years. 


While we live in a HCOL area, I pay for her rent. From looking at the past 12 months using mint data, we have figured she needs $950 per month to pay for everything (car insurance, phone, food, books, utilities) and $200 of miscellaneous expenses. 

Here is some other information:

Her Savings: $6000
Trust fund available in 1 year, 2 year: $7500, $7500
Grants: Around $1000 per semester and all courses paid for (community college, this would go away when she goes to a 4 year to graduate). 


The colleges she is looking at will be around $7500 per year, so her trust fund should take care of the cost for tuition/supplies. Knowing her expenses are around $1000 per month, she would like to take out a $24000 loan. 


If you have been in a student loan situation before, what would you do? Where is a good place to go to market different student loans (private/federal).

personalfinance,What interest rate should I invest in VS paying extra to student loans?,"Hello PF!

Thanks to this subreddit, I have really been clamping down on getting my student loans paid off. In the last 6 months I've been able to cut a huge chunk (almost 40k--some was savings for a house) by sticking to a budget and cutting costs where they weren't needed. At this point I still have roughly 90K remaining to pay off, with a salary of roughly 80k gross a year. Here are my remaining loan break downs (rounded for easy math)

- $2200 @ 2.07%

- $3000 @ 5.35%

- $2400 @ 4.25%

- $18500 @ 2.88%

- $11200 @ 2.88%

- $35000 @ 4.78%

- $17500 @ 4.78%

At the moment I am paying roughly $2000/month extra towards my student loans, going after the highest interest rates first. I have eliminated everything I had that was higher than 5.5%. My question is: at what interest point would it make more sense to invest my additional funds each month VS paying extra towards my student loans? I imagine after a certain point I could confidently make more in returns than I would lose in interest. All of these numbers are after I contribute my maximum matched value to my 401k, and keeping my emergency fund of $6000 fully funded.

personalfinance,"I am a 23 year old male with no money, no job, about 10k in debt to various people and agencies, and it is making me incredibly stressed and depressed. I don't know where to begin.","Ok so this may be a long text based post. If you read all of it thank you for taking the time. So a little backstory, I used to have a serious gambling problem which I stopped for about a year when I had gotten into a serious relationship. My girlfriend however couldn't pay for her schooling, nor get grants, or loans in her name so I told her I'd help. I began taking out credit cards to help may for it and eventually, a loan. The loan was a $4,500 loan with a 33% interest rate. This was back in March 2015. Aside from that, I compiled up over 4k dollars of debt on 4 different credit cards with varying interest rates between 19.99 and 23%. 

After me and my girlfriend broke up I became very depressed and began to do nicotine chew (dip) since quit, drink everyday (still do), and gamble (since stopped due to having no money), and began to just all around not care about my life. I quit my job because I hated it and used my depression as a cop out to quit. I went through about 30-50 days of pure degeneracy with a friend who has a like mindset. We would wake up and immediately go drink and gamble and not come home until midnight, later, or not at all. Since I was soon out of money he began to give me some. I now owe him over $1500. I owe a few dollars here and there to a few other friends as well totaling close to $700 all in all. So here I am over 10k in debt with no job. 

However, a friend of my mother's told me I am a lock to get a job within her company doing customer service, which obviously I do. It pays $13 an hour for a 40 hour work week. So I will be grossing $520 a week. My expenses other than debt per month total $175 (Yes, I live at home). My credit card minimums are 25,25,35, and 45 dollars per month, and my loan is $179 per month. The loan however, is an interest first loan, so my first payments go directly to interest. I've been paying for about 5 months and have only paid $200 to the principal! Is this a bad loan, or is paying interest first a good thing?

I need a lot of advice please, I don't know what to do or who to pay first when I get my job.

personalfinance,Credit score strategy question,"Basically I'm trying to refinance a bunch of debts into a HELOC and I need to boost my FICO just a bit to get me into a preferred rate. 

The debts I'm looking to refi are a bunch of credit cards and one alternative student loan ranging in rate from 13 to 26 percent. I've been trying to apply the snowball strategy and my credit score has been inching up from a low below 600 a few months ago to now 667.

Now the problem is that I've applied all of my surplus money to paying off small nasty debts but I've still got a few of those left and my larger lines, which have lower interest rates, are maxed out; between that and my complete lack of savings, I ended up derailed by a $1200 unexpected car repair, which went on the new card I'd obtained in hopes of a low rate balance transfer but now at least carrying a low intro rate. 

Ducks are almost in a row for a home equity loan to refinance. I own my house free and clear (on paper anyway) and I've got a stable income, but my current salary is barely better than subsistence. (Please refrain from advice on that point, trust me I've looked into it and no, nobody is hiring second year attorneys in any part of New York where I can afford to live and I don't have the $3000 to get licensed in another state etc...) 

My banker believes that I can get about $35,000 in a HELOC which would be enough to cover my debts and give me some cash out to set up an emergency fund, get caught up on car and house maintenance, and potentially take another bar exam to expand my job prospects. 

My FICO is currently reported at 667 according to my credit cards, which now include that info on the statement. 

Several cards are totally maxed out. One has about 10% available. At least one (store card) is totally idle and empty. On the whole, my utilization is probably about 80% overall but as high as 99% of any individual line (less than 50% for a few and 0% for one or two). 

I need to boost my FICO score as quickly as possible so that I can qualify for the HELOC. I'm concerned about doing that hastily though because these cards are costing me $500 in monthly interest and just getting the rate down below 10% gives me breathing room and let's me start denting the principal.  

What should I do?

Please limit the scope of discussion to how I can strategically apply my income, which is about $3000/mo take home, of which only about $300 is left as ""flexible"" after paying my bills and actual expenses. I've already taken all available steps to reduce my expenses; it's mostly the debts that are killing me but also taxes insurance etc. 

Among well-intended suggestions this group has previously put forth that I would prefer to avoid: no, I can't sell my car (negative equity); no, I can't sell my house (saves me rent); no, I'm not willing to give up my hobbies (they cost significantly less than the interest and are not the issue); and no, I don't have anything left to sell that's not already on the market. 

TLDR: With limited disposable income and a few maxed-out credit cards and a few at higher rates and lower balances, what strategy should I follow to boost my credit score to allow me to refinance with a home equity loan in a few months?",finance,1441136473
personalfinance,HELP! Can I afford a 300k home in Alberta in two years?,"Some background information.

Income
I am a new graduate working in a large heavy duty equipment company as an analyst grossing ~60k a year with potential bonus of upwards to 13%. Most of the bonus relies heavily on how well the organization as a whole performs and seeing how Stats Canada just painted a gloomy picture of the economic situation I would suggest it's highly unlikely I see the full 13%. 

Debt
I'm about ~40k in debt from student loans. Currently, I'm making $400 a month payments to the provincial and federal student loan totally $800 a month. $300 of that is kindly subsidized by my mother.  I have no credit card debt other than my monthly spending that average about $500-$900 depending on the number of activities that month, ie. birthdays, travelling, etc. This figure also includes reoccurring costs such as gas, gym membership, and cell phone bills.

Current Situation
At the moment I'm fortunate enough to be living at home where most of living expenses are covered. Since last May 2014 I've saved a little bit shy of 30k with the intention of purchasing a new sports vehicle but quickly dismissed the idea as a poor investment. Each month I add at least another $500 to that savings account, usually if there's a surplus over 3k in my spending account I would immediately transfer the residual into my savings. Hence why I was able to save 30k since May 2014. 

Goal
Ideally, I'd like to be moved out in two years time. My objective is to save up 20% of the down payment because I heard that there are tax breaks as opposed to 5% or 10% down payments. Therefore, I rather not purchase the new home without preferably a 60k down. There are new luxury condominiums being built in my downtown core that are extremely appealing. If possible I would live in this condo up to five years and rent it out afterwards and have other individuals pay for my mortgage. Another option is a suburb town-home. 

Questions
I guess what I'm wondering is, is my dream economically feasible? 

What is a realistic price range for a home if I was to be living alone?

If I was to pursue this dream in 2 years time, would I be living paycheck to paycheck not being able to afford anything else?",finance,1441136872

personalfinance,Getting a new car/loan with short credit history.,"Good afternoon Reddit!

Here's my situation. I have about $21,000 in my savings account. Current rent with utilities comes out to 650 a month. Credit score with experian and transunion is 670, recently had a collection fall off but only 4 months credit history and 9 hard inquiries. Approximately 2000 a month in income after taxes with a steady FT job.

With a short credit history I'm concerned about high interest rates, but I've been responsible with 2 credit cards (kohls,  capital one quicksilver one) and my score has been slowly rising.

 Should I continue to build my credit and wait for a longer history, pay in full after I save enough to do so or try to get a loan now? Naturally I'd rather not spend the majority of my savings but I'm concerned about having a high interest rate.

Below is an overview of our income/spending and we want to make sure we are using our money as efficiently as possible. Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything.

I work from home when not traveling. My employer pays all car expenses including gas and insurance as well as phone and Internet. Wife owes 0 on her 2005 Subaru 100k miles and her car insurance and phone are paid for by her family. Her commute to work is 1 mile and she usually drives our electric golf cart weather permitting. 

0 credit card debt. 

Mortgage is currently at $282k at 3.625% with minimum monthly payment of $1725 including all taxes etc. 

Total combined student loans $78k ($31k and $47k) both federal consolidated at 6.5% fixed with a minimum monthly payment $575 ($200 and $375.)

Both contribute 10% to 401k (her employer match is 6% mine is 3%) and pay for full medical, dental, vision insurance through work. 

Baby due in March.

$150k/year combined gross annual income

$7.5k/month take home

$15k emergency fund

$3k joint savings

$2k vacation/travel savings


Current Monthly Budget:

$2k mortgage

$2100 ($750, $1350) Student loan payment

$1000 Joint savings direct deposit

$1000 Groceries and going out

$200 gas/electricity

$125 Hair Cuts/care

$100 TV

$40 dog

$40 W/S/G

$30 Golf cart insurance

$25 HOA

$20 Gas for Subaru


The remaining monthly income usually goes towards recreation (golf, skiing, attending sporting events) clothing, and date nights. I'm assuming once the baby arrives it will go towards that.

Our goal is to pay off student loans as quickly as possible. The joint savings account is for baby related expenses at this point, but we have no idea what realistic amount we should have saved for that. 

We have zero personal finance background and have made these payment choices based purely off of online calculators. I just want to make sure we aren't doing something drastically wrong. What would be the best thing to do with the monthly student loan money once the loans are paid off? In the months where my wife or I get 3 pay checks (paid bi-weekly alternating weeks) what is the smartest thing we can do with that money?

Any help or advise would be appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1441139456

personalfinance,Questions about starting a budget (Canada),"I've been lurking on this sub for quite a while and have been putting a lot of thought into taking a budget really seriously after hearing about so many success stories. My girlfriend and I just moved into a new place close to our work and I think it's a good time to knuckle down, I've created a spreadsheet for our budget and reviewed it with my girlfriend, we're both happy with it, my plan is to take turns updating the spending on the spreadsheet every Sunday evening.

I have $7000 in student loan debt and and $12,000 car loan debt, both have interest rate of approx 5%. I have approx $7000 in my bank account and my girlfriend owes me about $2000 as I helped her buy her car so she could get to her job, me and her make both make $55,000/year, I've been working for 1.5 years since finishing my degree and she is just getting started (2 months in).

I've decided my first plan of action is to invest approx $4000 into my debts while keeping a $3000 emergency fund in my chequeing account (good idea?). One thing I have grown accustomed to is having my bank fees waived on my chequeing account, but if I wanted to keep my unlimited transaction account I will have to suck up the $15/month fee when I lower my balance, I would need to keep a balance of at least $4000 to get the fee waived.

My main goal right now for me and my girlfriend is to become debt free (she owes $20,000 in student loan).

personalfinance,"$64k of student loans paid off in 18 months, should we pay off the low % remainding balance?","I'm looking for some opinions and a sanity check from the /r/personalfinance community. I am a long time lurker and visit this page daily for stories of encouragement.

My story: In March of last year I stared at a ~$80k student loan balance between my wife and I (mostly mine though), ranging between 2%-6.5%. At 33, I was 7 years after finishing my MS degree and staring at a lifetime of repayment (the reason for the large balance was also due to a layoff and 10 mos of unemployment, along with other hardships back in '09).

As the only earner (my wife is a stay at home mom, we have two young kids) with a salary of $92k and living in a relatively high COL big city, I decided to strap the family down and start knocking down the debt aggressively. The goal was to pay it all off in 3 years. However, due to some motivation from reading /r/personalfinance, mr money mustache and Dave Ramsey, I decided to go more extreme: sold one of our paid off cars ($13k - not buying a replacement yet), did some side jobs (~$2-3k over the 18 mos), bonuses, and went crazy improving my marketability/networking and found a new job paying $120k (got a sign on bonus and got a large unused vacation time payout). This resulted in a $64k payoff in 18 mos.

Here's my dilemma: After paying off all of the higher interest student loans, we now have $16k left at 2% and 3.1%. I decided that instead of paying these off, I'll go back to investing the surplus. Right now, I'm planning on maxing out my 401k and Roth (no match yet in the new job, starts next year) and taking the additional $2k/mo and building up our emergency fund (We kept a minimal $1k during the repayment). After that's done, I'm still debating between paying off the remainder of the $16k within a few months, or letting it ride out the low interest rates and investing the $.

We have no other debt outside of the mortgage and have about $31k sitting in an old employer's Vanguard account. At 34, I'm looking to seriously catch up as I feel far behind where I would like to be in my life. My wife will be looking to go back to work within the next 3-4 years, so that will help us save and invest a little more as well.

personalfinance,Student Loan and Job Predicament.,"I graduated a little over a year ago and managed to get a nice paying job in tech. I’ve been paying down my student loans more than I’ve needed to, while also contributing almost the maximum that I can to my 401(k). Recently, however, the corporate life has been dragging on me, and I’m considering reducing or stopping my contributions to my 401(k) and then destroying my student loans so that I can leave my job and travel once they’re paid off.

My 401(k) vests at 4% but I have to stay at my company for three years in order for the matching contributions to vest. I also have a stock award valued around $3000 but I have to stay for three years in order for that to vest as well.

Currently, I pay between $1,000-$1100 a month on student loans, trying to pay the highest interest rates down fastest.
I also contribute about $1,650 a month to my 401(k), but am considering reducing this and paying around $500/month into my 401(k) and
around $2200 a month toward student loans. 

My specific loans are outlined below:

Loan Type | Current Principal | Interest Rate
---|---|---
Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan | $5,247.56 | 3.86%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan | $1,806.18 | 3.86% 
Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan | $5,232.01 | 3.4% 
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan| $5,910.02 | 6.8% 
Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan | $4,164.38 | 3.4% 
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan | $5,719.73 | 6.8%
Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan | $3,207.94 | 4.5% 
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan | $6,427.80 | 6.8% 
School Loan | $3,378.11 | 5%
Total sum of all loans to date: **$41,093.73**

If I continue my trend of paying around $1,000 a month, I should pay my loans of in around 41 months - or a little over three and a half years from now. However, if I change my 401(k) contributions and switch to around $2200 a month, I’ll knock them out in about a year and a half.

What do you think I should do? Are there any optimizations I’m missing out on? Are there things I should think about that I haven’t mentioned here? 

I feel like I’ve been doing the right thing as far as contributing to my 401(k) and paying my student loans off, but I’m frustrated by the slow progress. Three and a half years feels like a very long time at this corporate environment.

I'm feeling pretty poor today after checking my various account balances.

I'm looking forward to putting that extra money onto my credit card, which has crept it's way up to a roughly $8000 balance. I am ashamed of it!

Emergency Fund: currently my savings has ~1,800 in it. This was my ""emergency"" fund but due to family weddings, moving, and preventative maintenance on my car this summer, it has dwindled.

&amp;nbsp;
  
Question 1: Should I use the MF to pay off some of my loans? After reading a few other posts, I looked into unbury.me and I realized I have a few options to pay off loans faster. I’ve always thought that staying “liquid” is better, but it sounds like I was wrong. The performance of the MF has been 3.8% since April 2012 and -2.3% YTD. The MF was opened with the purpose of being low risk, long term money to forget about until I want to buy a house or to reinvest in a retirement/ college fund for kids (none yet). I am also thinking of proposing to my GF and would use a small piece of the MF to pay for the ring. I could use a majority of the MF to put toward loans and have a little left over to emergency. The financial adviser that I have the MF fund through has a $10,000 minimum. Not saying they will close the account if I withdraw the money, but it is a consideration.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
Question 2: Should I consolidate my loans? I have tried in the past, but keep getting rejected due to debt to income ratio and overall debt. My credit is great (850+ at last check a few months ago). I will most likely need a cosigner, which will be difficult to get.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
My current debt situation becoming increasingly burdensome as I start to think about the future with my gf; wedding, house, kids, save for retirement, kids college fund, etc. and want to do the right thing. Thanks for reading and any advice is helpful!

personalfinance,Can I open multiple identical cards?,"I have a small credit card balance (~$3,500) sitting on a 0 APR card. I pay it down 1-200 at a time but being 0 APR, I put any unallocated money to aggressively paying down our student loans or to retirement savings. The intro period on this card (Citi) is up in 6 months and I was planning on just moving the balance to another 0 APR card and continuing to pay it down in trickles. I don't want to pay a balance transfer fee though. Chase Slate is the only card I know of with a substantial 0 APR promotional period as well as no balance transfer fee. I already have one though. Can I open another one? If not, is there any chance that I can call Chase and get them to agree to offer me the zero balance transfer fee perk?

EDIT: Everyone seems to be focusing on the credit card balance rather than my actual question. I understand that credit card balance is not ideal, but at 0APR it makes absolutely no sense to put cash towards it when I have 80k of student loan debt at 4.5%. We have more than enough cash to pay it off if I wanted to, but for now, we are choosing to put all excess cash to the student loans. If we run out of options to maintain the 0APR we will of course pay it off in full immediately. The balance represents about 5% usage of my total available credit and is doing no damage to my credit (currently 818). The balance is a result of an IRS debt we didn't have the cash to pay about three years ago. We put it on a 0 APR card and transferred it to another one when the intro period ran out. We have both since gotten new jobs for a gross increase of more than 50k. Overspending is not an issue, it just doesn't make sense to prioritize a 0 APR debt over a large 4.5% debt. I thought this sub was always advising paying down the higher interest rate debts first?

We do have an emergency fund fully funded with 2 months of status quo spending or 3 months of spending if we had to make cuts for a true emergency. We are both contributing enough to our 401(k)s to get the full match and we are maxing out our ROTH IRA contributions this year (probably our last year of eligibility under the income cap). I already have a Chase Slate card and a Chase Marriott Rewards card. I was simply wondering if Chase would approve me for a second Chase Slate card or if they don't approve multiple cards of the exact same type.

personalfinance,What interest rate can I expect?,"I'm 20 years old, just out of trade school, zero debt, and living at home.  I have a $18/hr job in which I get at least 40hrs per week with usually a little overtime (and I know not to count on it). Been there 3 months so far.  I've had a credit card for a little over a year, never missed a payment.  I've had an apartment while in school, but my step-dad cosigned with me.  I was basically on my own for about a year while in school and never missed any payment.  

The vehicle I'm responsible for now is a '93 toyota pickup with 315K miles.    The title is in my name but it's technically my sisters. She is living in Japan for a few years for her work, but will want the truck back when she returns, which means I can't sell it.  In the last year of driving it, I've had to spend about $3500 to keep it running.  I hate dumping all this money into a truck that's not mine.  I need to be in something more reliable.  I've narrowed what I want down to 3 things: 7.3L ford diesel w/ manual trans, 03-07 5.9L cummins w/ manual trans, or another tacoma (I know its the oddball here, but they're pretty darn cool).

Diesels ain't cheap, but they last several hundred thousand miles. I feel like it's a solid vehicle to have considering I will need to tow stuff and probably will find myself in a few mud holes here an there:)

Anyways, everything that meets my standards is about $25-30K.  **MY QUESTION IS**, what interest rate can I expect, given all of these details?  

Since I'm living at home my only monthly expense is gas, which is about $375/month.  In the past 3 months I've saved up $5k.  I don't realistically plan on getting the vehicle I want until I have $10k to put down, but since these trucks are so hard to find with low miles, a manual transmission and 4x4, if I find something I'm gonna want to jump on it. 

Also, there is no chance of me getting a cosigner for this.",finance,1441160385
personalfinance,what house should I get?,"lets get down to it:
I'm at 100k/yr (engineering contractor)
the wife makes roughly 112k/yr

two adults and one dog

we currently live in a place I bought cash in 2009 - just when the sky fell on the housing market - was a foreclosure. the space is fine but it's the neighbourhood that sucks. I'd be happy if i get 80k for it now after I put a lot of repairs in it. I don't know what I'll do with this place once we move so I'd like not to include it towards the new place.

I have 300k+ in liquid post tax savings, wife has ~50k. Ideally I would keep those investments where they are and only access them if we must.

here's where we are: wife likes a +300k house because she thinks anything lower will mean we'll be living in a drug area (which I agree we should get out of) I feel like 250k should be enough to purchase the house of my dreams (I don't dream big.. one story 3/2 with 2 car garage and 1/4 of acre for the dog to use as a toilet)

homes like I described around here start at 150 (where they look like the owners have a non stop yard sale.. to be gentle) to... well there's no limit but the wife would agree that 400 is overkill.

maybe i should have started this thread in r/princess_wife? (donno if that subreddit exists)

any suggestions?

edit: one more thing to mention - the housing prices gone up by what seems like +30% in the area in the last 2-3 years which makes me feel like I should wait for them to come down some - maybe when interest rates go up a bit? hopefully all else being equal the prices should adjust downward some for the average home buyer monthly mortgage to keep constant?",finance,1441160883
personalfinance,Any advice on what else I can do to min-max clearing out my debt?,"At the start of the year I made a pact with myself to buckle down and work towards clearing out my debt.

I had 4 credit cards to start:  an Amazon Rewards card (19.24% variable, $1800 limit), a Visa through my credit union (8% $500 limit), a Barclaycard Master Card (22.99% $3,500 limit), a Best Buy Store Card (no interest financing always paid off on time, $1,600 limit).  I also had a seasonal loan from my Credit Union ($5,000 at 5% APR over 5 years).  Additionally I had a no-interest financing account with Motorola for my phone ($3,600 limit for some reason) and a auto loan from my old credit union for somewhere around $20k at 4.5% over 72 months, and a pair of Federal Subsidized Stafford student loans taken in 2013 for $5,500 at 3.4% and 3.86% which were still in deferment .

My total debt was somewhere in the ballpark of $38,000.  At the beginning of the year I was bringing home about $870 after taxes and company health insurance.  I had maybe $300 in savings that fluctuated wildly as sometimes I needed to pull from it to pay everything for the month, but I'd always try to put a little bit back in every paycheck.

---

Back in April I started using You Need A Budget and switched to new local Credit Union (my old one was in a different town, but worked fine for the most part).  The new credit union is nice as they give me 2% interest on my checking account for having an auto loan with them, and the refi terms were very good.

So here's where I'm at now.  The Barclaycard outstanding balance was paid off, and they have offers almost all the time for 0% interest balance transfers for 10-12 months with a 3% transfer fee.  So I consolidated my outstanding credit card debt that *was* accruing interest onto it, which has zero interest accrual until July next year.  The credit union visa has no balance and I don't use it any longer.  The Amazon Rewards card is what I now use to pay for everything I can to get those rewards points, and I pay it off 100% every single month.

I was able to refinance my car loan through the new credit union for a 60 month period at 2%.  Currently the payments are around $375/mo  and my balance is $17,600.  My old credit union's seasonal loan is down to $4000, still at 5% for another 48 months.

My student loan deferment period ended as I stopped taking classes when the financial aid dried up last year.  I've just made my first payment and they're currently at $5,490 on the 3.86% loan and $5,470 on the 3.4% loan.  Min payments are $56 and $54 respectively.

My Best Buy and Motorola Credit accounts are still not accruing interest and I've got a set schedule to pay them off before each purchase hits the financing offer end date.

My income has also improved recently.  Today I've hit my 1-year anniversary with the company and my take home pay is about to jump significantly between a raise and the company now paying 100% of my health plan.  I estimate my take home pay is going to be around $980 biweekly, but I won't see for certain till the pay periods line up in a few weeks.

personalfinance,Personal loan to local business?,"Dear r/PersonalFinance, I need some advice.

I'm a frequent customer of a local business, who is in the process of moving to a new location.  The new location will about double their size, seems to me a general sign that the business is doing quite well, with a very steady customer base and presumably a good financial forecast.

However, they're looking for help with the financials for the move.  One of the things they've requested (via their monthly newsletter) is personal loans to the business.  Details include 10% interest and repayment in 3 years, starting several months after their move is complete.

I'm currently sitting on a decent chunk of change due to a number of circumstances.  I've been meaning to invest it for a while now, but haven't gotten around to it.  Given the option, I'd much prefer to invest in the community, especially a shop that I frequent on a regular basis, and have an interest in helping continue to prosper.  Even without the high interest rate, I'd consider investing.

What I'm looking for is some advice.  Sure, I'd love to hear opinions on whether it's worth doing, but more importantly, I'm looking for what information I need to be asking, and how to evaluate the answers, to make sure I'm not going to be throwing money into a potential problem.

What can I do to protect myself if I go through with this?  What questions do I need to be asking about their finances? What questions CAN I ask about their finances?

I'd love to help them out, and the high interest rate is a bonus, but I mostly just want to make sure I'm able to keep myself and my investment as safe as possible, even if ultimately I don't end up making anything on the investment.

Will provide as much detail as I can, although at this point I'm not sure I have much more than this off hand.

financialindependence,Evaluate my stock/bond emergency fund strategy,"Earlier this year my wife and I switched our emergency fund from a cash savings account to a 50/50 stock/bond fund (VTMFX - Vanguard Tax Managed Balanced Fund).  The goal for this fund is to have about 130% of 6 months of living expenses.  The extra 30% is to ensure we have enough if our emergency coincides with a substantial market drop.  Honestly, I don't expect to use this fund anytime soon because we are both public sector employees with very secure jobs.  Wife is a state employee, I'm a federal employee.  So we are investing for the long term and even with market volatility, I expect the return on a blended fund to exceed a cash account.  Good articles about this strategy [here] (https://www.betterment.com/resources/personal-finance/safety-net-funds-why-traditional-advice-is-wrong/) and [here](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/rethink-your-emergency-savings-strategy-2014-03-11).

Furthermore, we are saving money for major planned 1 to 3 year expenses (eg. home improvement projects) in an intermediate term bond fund (USATX - USAA Tax Exempt Intermediate Term Fund).  The goal is capital preservation with just a little risk/potential for growth.  Got the idea for this separate account from Michelle Singletary, [she calls it the ""life happens"" fund](http://live.washingtonpost.com/color-of-money-live-20150409.html).  What I like about this account is that our allocation to this account can be part of the monthly budget, but when we pay for the big planned expenses, it doesn't bust our budget and disrupt our savings rate.

Lastly, we keep an extra month's worth of cash in our checking account anyway, so immediate cash is not a major issue.

worldpolitics,Stocks Plunge - Increasing Signs of Global Slowdown (2Sept2015) - [text],"2 September 2015

Global stock markets staged yet another selloff Tuesday following the release of negative economic data in the US and China and downbeat assessments of the global economy from officials at the Federal Reserve and International Monetary Fund.

At the time of this writing, Asian markets continued to fall Wednesday morning, with China’s Shanghai Composite Index down by 3.66 percent.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 469 points, or 2.8 percent, on Tuesday. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index fell 3 percent and the Nasdaq fell 2.9 percent. All three indexes are now down by more than 10 percent from their recent highs, placing them in correction territory.

The selloff in the US followed a 3.8 percent drop on the Japanese Nikkei and a 3 percent fall on Britain’s FTSE 100, with almost every major global stock index closing down for the day. The Shanghai index fell by over 5 percent before closing with a loss of 1.3 percent.

The renewed turbulence on financial markets follows last week’s dramatic global selloff, in which the Dow opened August 24 with a loss of nearly 1,100 points, its largest intraday fall in history, and closed down by 588 points.

Tuesday’s selloff was initially triggered by weak data from China, showing the country’s manufacturing activity hitting its lowest level since August 2012. China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 49.7 last month, indicating the first contraction in manufacturing since February.

As one trader quoted by the Financial Times put it, “People are losing confidence, with the whole situation [in China] breaking down, not just in the stock market but in [real economic] data as well.”

The same day, an index of factory activity in the US for August fell to a two-year low of 51.1, down from 52.7 in July, a decline that analysts attributed to the slump in global demand and the appreciation of the dollar.

The negative data corresponded with a downbeat assessment of the global economy by the International Monetary Fund and Federal Reserve. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said Tuesday that global growth is expected to be weaker than the IMF had predicted, reflecting “a weaker-than-expected recovery in advanced economies and a further slowdown in emerging economies, especially Latin America.”

Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Federal Reserve, said in a speech in New York later in the day that the collapse in commodity prices and the slowdown in the global economy “might suggest a downward revision in the forecast” for economic growth in the United States.

Also Tuesday, the South Korean trade ministry said the country’s exports fell by 14.7 percent compared with a year ago, the eighth consecutive monthly decline. The figure showed the worst annual fall in exports for South Korea, the biggest exporter to China, since 2009.

This report added weight to the observation by the Financial Times over the weekend that recent data showed “world goods trade contracting at its fastest rate since the global financial crisis.”

Over the weekend the newspaper concluded, based on its own research, that “weakness in emerging market currencies is hurting global trade by reducing imports without any benefit to export volumes.” It quoted former Pimco CEO Mohamed El-Erian as declaring, “We risk slipping into a beggar thy neighbour, competitive spiral of currency devaluations.”

The article noted, “Since June 2014, the currencies of Russia, Colombia, Brazil, Turkey, Mexico and Chile have fallen by between 20 per cent and 50 per cent against the dollar, while the Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah are at their weakest since the Asian financial crisis of 1998.”

The global turbulence is leading to a substantial selloff of assets by mutual funds, particularly those with exposure to emerging markets. CNBC noted that “if current trends hold, July and August will mark the first consecutive monthly net outflow from both bond and equity funds since late 2008.”

A major factor in the financial turbulence is the dramatic economic reversal in emerging market economies, whose export-led booms are collapsing amid slowing global demand, the slump in commoditiy prices and a reversal of massive capital inflows that predominated in previous years. As a result, the prices of both sovereign and corporate bonds are falling, threatening the solvency of financial institutions that speculated in these assets.

Commodity prices also slumped dramatically, with oil prices dropping by 7 percent following a three-day rally. The Financial Times cited hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand as declaring that oil prices were likely to continue falling, possibly sinking as low as $30 per barrel.

The rout on global markets took place despite renewed indications from central banks that they would respond to the weakening economic situation with a further easing of monetary policy. Boston Fed President Rosengren, in the speech noted above, suggested that the weakening of economic data “is large enough to raise concerns about whether further tightening of labour markets is likely.”

This points to the fact that the continuing flood of money from the Fed, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan into the financial markets does little to halt or reverse the stagnation in the real economy. While propping up the asset values of the financial elite, this policy has only exacerbated the financial parasitism that underlies the slump dominating the world economy.

The world’s governments and central banks responded to the 2008 financial crisis by blowing a massive financial bubble and transferring trillions of dollars in social wealth from the working class to the financial aristocracy. Seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the global capitalist crisis is once again erupting with full force.",finance,1441193499

personalfinance,It's probably time to move on my from my 2000 Accord. I would like some feedback on the options I'm pondering.,"**TLDR:** My 15-year-old car is starting to give out. I'm thinking about draining a lot of my emergency fund on a down-payment for a new or slightly-used car (preferably with a warranty/""Certified Pre-Owned"" status) and then financing the rest. My real question is about how wise it is to spend a lot of my emergency fund on a down payment. I know that it's traditionally unwise, but I don't have many required monthly expenses, and I have no debt, month-to-month lease, good insurance, etc., which makes me very flexible and less worried about having to scrape by.

***

I have a 2000 Honda Accord with 130,000 miles on it. I bought it when it was at 112,000 in August of 2012 for $5,000 cash. 

The car has always run amazingly well, it has had regular maintenance, and there are no known major issues. However, it's started giving me trouble in the last few months, and frankly I just don't want to mess with it anymore. 

In July, I started having some belt chirping and weird noise. I got a belt replaced and some things fixed up for a couple hundred bucks. While I was in there, the mechanic reminded me of my tires, which had admittedly gotten way past the end of their life. So I scheduled to have new tires installed, which was about $400 all-in. And then the day before my appointment, the A/C stopped working in 100 degree, 90% humidity St. Louis weather. I figured it just needed a Freon recharge; turns out it was the A/C compressor, which was $900 to buy and install. And now this morning the car wouldn't start, and I'm fairly certain it's the fuel pump. Probably another couple hundred bucks. 

I recognize that it's pretty stupid to put $2,000 into a car that's probably worth about $2,000, and that's being charitable. But each of these repairs seemed like a small, one-time fix that would give me a lot of utility for my dollar. I'm increasingly thinking that was a stupid choice. 

Regardless of all that, where I stand right now is that I have a car that *theoretically* could be reliable transportation for just a few hundred bucks. But I don't think I want to mess with that anymore. I can't be calling AAA and bumming rides off of coworkers. I'm just not going to deal with that in my life. 

So, it comes down to buying either a new or used car. Ordinarily, I'd think that buying a new car is a waste of money, as is the common wisdom. But there's a lot of peace of mind. With the financing options available, a new car would not be beyond my monthly budget. And, frankly, this whole idea of the ""half-priced 2013 Honda with 30,000 miles"" is just a myth. However, I do know there are deals to be had. But I feel like those are mostly through private parties, and I think I'm willing to pay a premium so that I don't have to kick myself when I buy some piece of shit car off a guy on Craigslist who's since thrown his burner phone into the river. In other words, I hate buying and repairing cars, telling my boss I'm coming in late, bumming rides off coworkers, dealing with mechanics and all that jazz. If I can eliminate all aspects of owning a car from my life except for the payments, gas and insurance, there's real utility in that for me, and I'm willing to pay for it. I think a new car provides that. I'd just like someone to poke some holes in my theory for me. 

Relevant info: 

**Me:** 24/Male/Single

**Income:** $2,000 per month take-home

**Expenses:**

* Rent including utilities - $600

* Food/Entertainment - $400

* Gas - $120  

* Car Insruance - $90 

* Netflix/Google Play Music/Other recurring stuff - $100

* **TOTAL:** $1,310

* Balance (usually a little less than $700) - Savings 

**Savings/Emergency Fund:** $7,800

My required monthly expenses are only about $950, as I spend a pretty decent amount of money on entertainment, restaurants, bars, etc. That could easily be cut down if I were to lose my income or suffer some other emergency. So I have more than enough money to cover 6 months' expenses. 

Now, where I feel I'm slipping into dangerous territory is that I'm contemplating seriously dipping into my emergency fund for a car. My (potential) justification for that is that my emergency fund is mainly for my car. I'm on a month-to-month lease, and I could move home if absolutely necessary. I have good insurance with a low deductible and an out-of-pocket maximum of $2,500. If I were to drain my money on a new car, it would have a warranty that would cover any potential issues until I was able to replenish my savings. 

What I'm thinking about doing is putting $5,000 on a new or slightly used Accord or Civic. I'd then have a loan for $15,000. Depending on the interest rate, I could get a 60-month loan for $300-$400 per month. I don't think my insurance would increase, as I (stupidly) already have collision insurance. 

That would bring my emergency fund down to $2,800, which sounds perilously low. However, I'm just not sure I see how that would be such a big problem. Car emergencies would be taken care of. I'd have enough money to cover medical emergencies. There's no way I could be stuck with a huge payment for breaking a lease. 

It sounds really scary to me, which is why I'm asking here. But I'm kind of leaning towards thinking it might be okay in this situation. Please tell me how wrong I am. Thanks.",finance,1441207387

We are trying to save for a house but we have all these debts that need to paid off. At this point in time we cannot do any consolidation for unfortunate reasons that cannot be stated. 

So in your opinion, should we pay off these debts first or should we save for a house to move out of the rent race (not that im complaining about renting - so please no bashing that over my head). 

Thanks all! :)

EDIT: The more expensive car has too much negative equity to sell. The other car is used. Also, both cars have sub 4% interest rate. No idea on the student loan (not mine)",finance,1441210930

personalfinance,Selling stock--are my capital gains tax estimates correct?,"Hi, personalfinance. I am a lurker on this sub and this is my first post. I have read the Wiki on capital gains tax, along with the About article linked, which was very helpful. I want to make sure my expectations for tax owed on the sale of some stock I have are on the right track.

I have 100 shares of stock in my name currently valued at $358 per share. The 100 shares were bought in 1990 at $10 per share by my grandparents. I am looking to sell to help with the downpayment on a home. The stock was purchased at a bank in Ohio, and I live in Massachusetts now.

My taxable income is $41,000/year and I file single. I see that my federal tax bracket is 25% and that I'd be subject to the long term investment 15% capital gains tax on the sale price. In addition, I'd need to pay Mass state tax on the capital gains at 5.2%. 

For simplicity's sake, let's assume I sell 100 shares at $358 each = $35,800. Are the below breakdowns correct? Do I need to figure in the purchase price of $1,000 (as I've done below), or any other fees my grandparents may have paid?
*Federal capital gains tax at 15% of $34,800 = $5,220
*Mass state capital gains tax at 5.2% of $34,800 = $1,809.60

I am still working to find a broker to set me up with a buyer(s). What sort of fee can I expect to pay for that service? What is a good percent or flat fee in this case? 

Am I totally off base here, or can you see anything I'm completely overlooking? I am totally new to the world of selling stock, so I want to make sure I'm not completely clueless before I pursue the sale of this. Thanks for any help!",finance,1441213089

personalfinance,How to Reduce My AGI and/or Tax Burden,"So here's the deal:

I'm unmarried and in my 30s. I live in a big, expensive city and rent a modest (but still expensive because: city) apartment. I work for a small company that I have equity in.  This year I'm expecting to make about the same as last, and my income is likely to increase over the coming years, assuming the business doesn't tank in the meantime. The relevant data are:

* 2014 AGI  $142,923 (slightly inflated because I converted Traditional IRA funds of $12,000 to Roth IRA funds)
* Federal Tax $27,259
* State Tax $9,917
* Taxable Income $121,740
* Itemized deductions of $13,283 (including state taxes and charitable contributions)
* Contribution to Roth IRA $5,500 (max)
* I pay about $1050 per month in student loans and am above the income cap for the deduction of student loan interest

Given that I'm in a small business, most of the advice that people give to reduce AGI and/or tax burdens simply don't apply to me. I don't have a 401k, a HSA, a FSA, or anything like that. The basic issue is that between FICA, state, and federal taxes, I dropped about $50,000 in taxes last year. 

I don't particularly mind paying taxes, but using some tax-advantaged vehicles to reduce that amount somewhat and help me save more effectively is kind of the goal. I'm looking to whittle down those student loans and save up for a down payment on a place, which is what I've been doing with the money that I don't use to live off of on a month-to-month basis for the past several years.

Any suggestions would be great. Thanks for reading.",finance,1441215277

personalfinance,Made an Oopsie- Likely NSF for First Month of Rent. Advice? (CAN),"Greetings, Reddit. Usually I'm on top of my finances, but this has been a hectic month. I'm moving house, and in between paying for the damage deposit, setting up utilities for my new place and arranging movers, I made a mistake.

Knowing it was going to be an expensive month, I budgeted tightly right up until the 1st of the month; at that time, I performed my usual habit of transferring over my excess balance to a savings account, with the knowledge that my pay cheque was hitting the next morning. I left exactly the amount required for the first month of rent on my new place plus another bill that was set to come out, and felt secure in doing so for the evening as I had a couple of bucks left in my wallet should I need anything.

Well, what do you know- I missed something. As I was under the usual $5,000 threshold I usually maintain in the account, I ended up incurring the bank's monthly account fee at the same time as the other two PAD debits. This left me in an overdraft position of some pittance (-$21) mere hours before my pay cheque hit. 

Unfortunately, I don't have overdraft protection, and I confirmed with my bank (TD) this morning that while the bank service fee and the smaller of the two bill PADs took place, the big one for rent was applied last and will likely be returned NSF.

I'm never NSFed this account before, and I especially didn't ever envision doing it the first time out paying rent to a new property management company. 

I've tried both calling TD Customer Service and visiting the branch to see if their automated systems can run this transaction again, with the balance now available. However, I couldn't secure any assurances it would be, with a faint light of hope that ""the system MIGHT try again internally before reporting the NSF, and see you have the funds"".

Is there anything else I should/could do? I took a skim through my tenancy agreement and it appears I'll be due a total of $100 in NSF and late payment fines, and again I really didn't want my first experience with this property management company to be such a negative one. 

UPDATE: I have posted an update below. TL;DR- TD did a solid on my behalf today by covering the overdrawn amount, and did so for a fee of just five bucks! Great bank.",finance,1441216368
personalfinance,Deducting out of pocket medical expenses,"Hey PF.  I have a question.   My wife and I just had our first child in June.  My insurance kinda sucks, so we've had a lot of out of pocket expenses.

We've paid $600 from our regular bank accounts, and paid $700 from an HSA.  This paid for all the pre-delivery appointments, ultrasounds, and lab work.  It also paid the anesthesiologist and doctor who delivered.

We're now looking at $5600 from the hospital.  I set up a payment plan of $155/month for 36 months, we can swing it, as we've cut back on a lot of frivolous things in the last 5 months.

Now here's the question:  If we want to deduct this on out 2015 taxes, do we have to exclude what we paid from our HSA?  

Also, I assume that we can only claim what we have paid towards the $5600.  I was thinking about taking a personal loan out from the First Bank of Mom, and paying her back after tax time.

Our AGI will probably be about $47,000, so the medical deduction would be $1600 (expenses over 10% of AGI) our mortgage interest will be $2500 for the year, and $2100 in mileage expenses from work (the pay less than the Fed minimum, so I'm able to claim the discrepancy)

personalfinance,Home Equity loan a good way to consolidate high interest revolving debt?,"Hi everyone,
I have some high interest debt that Im looking to put a dent in. One is a credit card and the other is an unsecured personal loan, totaling around $25k. Each account has around a 15% interest rate and Im having trouble paying them down. My mortgage company (WF) contacted me with an offer to consolidate the high interest loan and credit card into a secured home equity loan and the offer almost seems too good to be true. 


I currently have about $60k in positive equity in my house, and they offered me up to $45k (I would take the minimum needed to pay off the debt) at a rate of 1% + prime. This would take my monthly payment obligations (not including mortgage and utilities) down from $750 to around $150. I plan on selling my house within the next year and settling any and all outstanding debts I have, so this loan would be gone in 6 months to a year. I would also cancel the credit card once this loan went through.


Does this sound too good to be true? Am I missing something major? Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks PF!",finance,1441219019

However, my school's financial adviser told me that my estimated income, combined with my mom's income, would preclude me from receiving the Pell grant.

Especially since it would mean taking out both federal AND private student loans when I transferred to university.

personalfinance,Should I buy a house in Denver or continue renting?,"I currently live with my GF in a 2br apartment (I work from home) in downtown Denver. Current rent is $1,800 after two parking spots ($65 each) and fixed water/gas charges ($40/$20 respectively). We split the rent 50/50.

I currently make around $120k and my girlfriend makes around $75k a year. She has student loans and for simplicity's sake I would be the one purchasing the house. I have about $160k in available savings at the current moment that I am putting to use in the market, and am saving roughly $5k a month. 

I just moved to Denver about 6 months ago and am considering buying a home. It's scary because the prices have skyrocketed in the last 5 years, and are projected to go even higher next year. Rent is also skyrocketing at a rate faster than homes are going up. I do not know how long I'll be in Denver (at least 2 years) but every time I do my taxes they wonder as a guy with no kids why I don't have some sort of property for tax breaks. But as someone that isn't sure about living somewhere more than a few years, a house is somewhat of a big undertaking.

I could put 20% down on a $500,000 home (my max), but that would require me taking the bulk of my savings out of the market, something I'm not super keen on. Others have suggested a lower down payment (like 10%) because interest rates are so low. But then I'd be required to pay PMI. My girlfriend would be paying a portion of the mortgage as ""rent"". It won't quite be 50%, but close.

I have tried the NYT rent calculator, but it's hard because you have to assume a lot of things about home appreciate and rent growth as well. 

While the housing prices have gone up significantly recently, it's still FAR more affordable than the homes in California (where I'm from). All of this makes my current decision very difficult. I want a home because I hate throwing away my money on rent, but I know renting isn't exactly ""throwing your money away"" because of all the extra costs that come with a home. But, I still want something to call my own, and I like the idea of having a stable investment. 

Tl;dr

Income - $120k

Savings - $160k

Current Rent - $1,900 (split with gf)

House Max - $500k (mortgage would be split with gf as ""rent"" I do down payment and in my name)

Down Payment - 10%? 20%?

Children - No (and no plans)

Current Monthly Savings - $5,000 after taxes

personalfinance,"Maybe We Should Reconsider The Mortgage Budget, In Light Of The ""Am I Nuts"" Threads.","We saw the two recent threads about mortgage pitfalls that happened.  One was prevented before it even happened, and the other, under all good intents and proper preparations, happened anyway.  In the budgeting section, it mentions that no more than 30% of your take home income should go to your mortgage.  That is excellent advice for people of modest means (like myself), but like all math, the more you go in the opposite direction, the more extreme it gets.

Like the quote from Hemingway's novel, on how a character went bankrupt, ""Slowly at first, and then all at once.""

Seeing as though this would encourage a family that is making $300K annually in take home pay to buy a house with a mortgage of $1 million, that seems extreme.  Any little fluctuation would put that family in peril.

Should we readdress this guideline to maybe make it match the local conditions for the family?  Detroit versus Palm Beach?  San Francisco versus St. Louis?

I'm not against the 30%.  It's an excellent rule.  Currently my mortgage is 15% of my take home pay, so I feel safe, myself.  I'm just trying to help others.

So, maybe we should anchor it to, say, the local population, and bounce that against the local median income, and then do some sort of square root of the local industries.

Any ideas?  Anyone have any links to local statistics and data?

Oh, and the first ""Am I Crazy"" thread seems to have been deleted since then.  If I had had the time to respond, here is what my response would have been:

""Yeah.  I don't think you could comfortably do it.  Especially since a good portion of your income is not stable, and a large chunk of your plan is about betting the mortgage on the health of a new business.

The budgeting guidelines over under the Wiki/FAQ Index are a really good set of guidelines to live by.  My own guidelines have always been, for a typical mortgage of 30 years, at current interest rates, a combination of:

1.  The total amount of the mortgage loan should not exceed your combined total stable gross annual salary.

2.  Just the amount of the principal that you owe each month (ignoring amortization) will be only half of your monthly mortgage payment.  You still need to add on interest and insurance.  So, whatever you owe monthly just for the property, you can easily double that to figure out what the total monthly mortgage payment will be.

3.  With all the utilities that you have to pay, including water, sewer, electricity, gas, cable, internet, and phone, those added up will about equal your monthly mortgage payment, as well.

So, to make sure that you are living stably, take the amount that you owe monthly just on the property, and then quadruple it.  That is truly what your monthly living expenses, just for your house, will approximate to.

Another general guideline is that every $100K of your mortgage loan, and every percentage point of interest, will equivilate to about $200 dollars in your monthly mortgage payment.

To use an example, if you bought a house for $100K at 5% interest, then you can expect your monthly mortgage payment to be somewhere around $1000K.

If you bought a house for $80K at 4%, your monthly mortgage payment should be somewhere around $640.

If you bought a house for $200K at 3%, your monthly mortgage payment should be somewhere around $1200.

personalfinance,Just refinanced my student loans but realized my previous SL servicer only applied payments to interest even though I paid above minimum payment. Help!,"Hi all,

Two key call out before we get into the details: 

1. I had no interest built up meaning all my accrued interest was paid off. Any accrued interest was only what was accrued between monthly payments.

2. I had 6 loans totaling ~100k. The highest loan was 42k with 8% interest. I made sure all payments above the minimum went towards that loan.

About a year ago, I refinanced my student loans with my previous service provider (will call them FedLoan). I had ~100k in SL and I refinanced them to 25 years primarily to show a lower minimum payment on my credit report so that I could, on paper, show better DTI ratio to purchase a house. My old minimum payments were $1,400 and after the refinance they were $750. 

I almost always paid a $1,000 a month towards my student loans for the past year. Then, just this past month, with the help my employer I was able to get a subsidized rate through another student loan company. Of course I refinanced right away. 

After refinancing, I looked through my historical statements with FedLoan. I noticed that pretty much all of my payments **went to interest only** even though interest accrued at the time was less than my monthly payment. Example: Debt = 100k. Interest equals 8%. Monthly accrued interest equals ~$670. Monthly payments = $1,000 so therefore 330 should towards principal. 

A few questions:

1. Is my logic correct that some portion of my loan payment should go to principle? 

2. If not, is it because they were they pulling in future interest charges due to my 25yr loan term?
   - If they were pulling in future interest rates, how is that legal if I'm paying off my loans faster? I didn't have a place where I could specify principal or interest but always ensure I covered the minimums and put the rest towards the highest loan with highest interest.

3. *If I'm in the right*, what are my legal options since I've refinanced away from FedLoan?

I was thinking about spending the $4000 I have left to pay for it and basically go back to $0 OR take my bank up on the offer of a $10,000 line of credit with an interest rate of 5.7% (payments need to be 10% of amount owed). Ofcourse I would still only spend about $4000 on a car, but I'm not sure if it's better to pay cash for the car and start from nothing or pay about $200 a month on my line of credit for the next few years. The idea of paying over $5000 on a $4000 car scares me, but I'm scared I won't be able to move out if I pay cash for the car. 
Ps. I live in a part of Canada where car insurance is exorbitant, so I have to factor in that expense.

&gt;Although the economy isn't ready for the kind of traditional rate-hike cycle of past eras -- one that includes increases at quasi-automatic intervals and that returns rates to the historical average policy level -- the current domestic economic conditions would justify (and have justified) a liftoff from the exceptionally low floor of zero percent.

&gt;The difficulty facing the Fed isn’t just the weaknesses in the global economy, but also the uncertainty about how its policy actions could end up indirectly undermining domestic growth, in particular by amplifying international financial instability and, therefore, the threat of adverse spill back from outside U.S. borders.

&gt;There is little doubt that the emerging world, led by China, is slowing, and in a manner that is unlikely to be offset by an acceleration of European and U.S. growth. There also is concern about whether the recent turmoil in emerging-markets financial assets, including the stunningly disorderly currency depreciations, could extend to the real economy -- first within a systemically important emerging nations (such as Brazil, China, Korea, Russia and others), then spreading to an advanced nation.",finance,1441287735

I have also been in the market for a car for the last year, but like many of you I am frugal and very particular. Will the fed rate hike substantially increase the base price of a vehicles, or the opportunity to finance at 0%?

Here is my more personal second part to this question. I currently work for a FCAU partner, as such I get 5% off invoice plus any normal incentives through promotions they are running. I have my eye on a newly redesigned Chrysler 200C that is fairly optioned up. After all is said and done, I can probably get away for about $25k. 

I currently make $60k base, 401K, and health/dental/life. I expect 10-25% increase in salary within the next calendar year. Also, my COL is considerably low, $600 rent, $200 utilities/misc. bills, splitting a rather nice house with one of my best friends. We've had this rent price ($1150 for 1700+ sqft.) locked in for about 6 years. I've completely paid of college loans, and have absolutely zero debt, a maxed (for the year) IRA, and contributing to a matching 401k.

Also note, I've driven around the same Toyota since senior year of high school (and it had 40k miles on it when purchased). Soon it will mark 10 years of me driving it (with only 140k miles to show), and mechanically it has been a absolute dream.

I kinda feel like I've ""made it"" enough to splurge on new vehicle, but I am not one that is terrible into materialistic things, but I do enjoy quality in my life. 

In short:
1) Will the incoming rate increase greatly effect what I pay if I bought now as opposed to directly after the hike?
2) With my current financial situation, does PF think I can afford this? Moreover, is it smart decision?

Final notes, I live very close to my job, in fact 1.8 miles, but occasionally I have to drive 20-25 miles to a major city. When the weather is good, I bike to work, but I live in a place where that's only about 3-4 months of year.

I indirectly work for FCAU but I do not particularly love the vehicles in terms of reliability and longevity. Honestly, I want the affordable Tesla sedan that will be in production in two years, and likely on the market within 4-5, so I may just resale this vehicle at that time. The only other car I am really considering is Subaru BRZ, which fits me as a person, but has a considerably lower quality interior for approximately the same price (for me).",finance,1441299314

personalfinance,Refinancing my mothers house under my name. I have no idea what I'm doing.,"**I am purchasing my mother's mortgage, not refinancing. Sorry for the confusion everyone**


Hey Everyone, here is my situation:

I’m 25 years old and live with my mother, grandmother and little brother. I make 55k a year and work in the IT Field. 

A little backstory about the apartment:
The apartment is in an already established neighborhood so I doubt the value will rise much higher than it currently is. When we first purchased the apartment 14 years ago, the value was at 300k, after an appraisal about 2 years ago, the apartment is valued at just under 500k. Unfortunately in 14 years, my mother was only able to pay off around 70k of the apartment and her credit is so terrible (sub 600) that the payments she’s paying right now is only covering the interest we are paying on the house (5.5%).  

My mother makes a decent amount of money (a bit over 100k), her terrible credit score was, in large part, due to my father who made very poor investments and gambling. My mother’s credit has been reset and now she has no credit. The reason why she wants to ~~refinance~~ **sell me her mortgage** under my name is because my credit is better than hers (mine is at 740) and someone we were speaking to at Quicken loans said they could possibly get us an interest rate in the high 3% - low 4%. My mother does not speak English well and she doesn’t make the most well informed decisions when it comes to our family’s finances, so she usually leaves all the big decision making up to me such as: the family health insurance plan, purchasing the new family car, cutting down costs etc.  Which sucks because despite all my googling on the topics beforehand, I still feel like I’m making the wrong decisions.

Along with refinancing the house under my name, my mother also wants to take out 50k worth in equity for my brother’s college tuition. So I would basically be taking on a 250k mortgage. Is this going to screw me somewhere down the line? What’s the best way to go about doing this?

Appreciate all the help!

Edit -- 
After the comments I've received, thank you so much for your replies guys, I should mention that the house would be in my name and my mother would still be helping pay for it. The main reason why she mentioned we do this is for the lower interest rate.",finance,1441303809

**Total student debt: $23,000**

This debt is dispersed among 4 different lenders. The lenders each have their own interest rates coming to an average of 5.68% across a total of 8 different loans (some private some government). 

Take my Great Lakes loans for example. I have two different ""accounts"" with them that I pay off individually. One account contains 2 loans (1 FFEL unsubsidized stafford, one FFEL subsidized stafford) and the other contains 4 loans (2 direct subsidized stafford loans and 2 direc unsubsidized stafford loans). The unsubsidized loans all currently have a 6.8% interest rate (highest interest rate among all my loans). 

I am currently paid ahead on **all** my loans until February '16.  A recent check on my loan status is what prompted my exploration into loan consolidation. I noticed that one of my loans had an original principal of $2000 and after 3 years is only down some $60. 

I am currently paying just shy of $500/month on my loans and have no problem meeting the payments. My original plan was to reconsolidate all my loans through SOFI to get a single interest rate. A quick soft pull on my credit from SOFI showed that my interest rate for a 10 year loan would probably be 6.5%. My credit score is pretty good (775). 

I chose the ten year option because the monthly payment was only $250. I could afford the 5 year payment ($466/month) but would prefer a bit of a saftey net in the event of unforeseen money problems. Not sure if that's the right move either?....

I feel like I am just rambling on at this point. Any direction or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I’m a 24 y/o graduate student. I recently started a new job that allowed me to move out of my parents’ house and would like to have my budget critiqued. I live in an apartment with my girlfriend and we split rent, internet, groceries, and utilities 50/50. I have one year of grad school left but work full time and have been paying down my loans. I currently have ~$30,000 in loans, and will have an additional $9,000 after this year, bringing the total to about $39,000 with around 6% interest, all federal loans. My plan is to dip into my savings to pay for this upcoming semester in full ($4,500), and put the $800/month I’m currently paying on my loans into a separate savings account so that I can also pay for my winter semester in full ($4,500). My job is stable and my parents live relatively close by so I could always move back in with them, rent-free, no questions asked, if shit hits the fan; this is my rationale for my willingness to pay for school out of my savings account. I do not have any immediate plans to purchase a home and plan to rent for the foreseeable future. I’m able to ride my bike to work so I spend very little on gas. We cook dinner at home at least 5 times a week, but I do go out for lunch nearly every day (this will hopefully change in the near future with the help of /r/mealprepsunday).

personalfinance,"First 6 figure job, 3 years out of college, seeking advice.","Hello reddit! I have been following this sub for a while now, and I would like to get some advice. I've been getting various different advice from people in my life and they are leaving me lost and confused.

I graduated college about three years ago and currently have 150k in student loans.  

I've been working different jobs since I've graduated, making about 30k a year, and I recently accepted a job offer that pays around 130k. 

The jump in the pay is really making things very difficult and confusing for me.

The first question I have is, should I refinance my student loans? The bulk of the 150k, let's say 120k is at around 6.55% and there are some smaller loans above and below that mark. I've been looking at companies such as earnest that will lend me the money and charge me about a 4.5-5% fixed interest rate. My first guess would be to take that for all of the loans that are over that mark, or would it be easier just to pay everything off at once and just make monthly payments to earnest? 

Second question...has a lot to do with taxes and a 401k plan.

My job will require me to move. They provide a lot of fringe benefits and some other really cool ones. I am able to lease a company car that can be used for both personal and business use. They pay for gas, insurance, maintenance, etc...I've run some of the numbers and it seems like taking the company car will be the best option, since my car is about 20 years old, near the end of it's life, and is paid off. Would the tax hit of using the company car be that significant? The payments also come from my pre-taxed salary, which come out to roughly 1300 a year. 

Other pre-taxed items would include my health insurance which, comes out to about 800 dollars a year. 

Also my company has a 401k plan, in which they contribute 8% of my base salary and 1% matching if I contribute a certain amount of my pay. 

I've been considering putting away close to 10-14% of my salary into the 401k plan, but may do less, since it leaves me around 1k in spending money per month after my rent, groceries, and misc expenses. 

With everything coming out of my salary before it is taxed, that would effectively lower the amount of money I have to pay in income tax? 

Oh and I also get a bonus between 20-40k depending if the entire company meets certain expectations. I would use most of this money to pay off my student loans. 
------

My goals are to pay off my student loans in the next 10 years. I really hate being in debt and having to pay what is essentially a mortgage. The faster I pay it off, the more I can spend / save.

My monthly expenses will be around, 2000-2500 paying off student loans, another 2000-2500 for rent (I have to move to an area with semi expensive rent, I did consider buying a house/condo, but I am not comfortable being a homeowner at this stage of my life, and I am unsure if I will still be in my current role in the next two years), what ever a monthly amount of groceries are, and misc expenses such as internet, etc...

My family has just been telling me to buy a place where I am moving to instead of renting. Don't take the company car and just use my current car (I've told them I needed a nice looking car, since I will attend a lot of meetings), that I should not put so much away into my 401k, that I would probably be better off paying someone to manage my finances.

This is a life changing event for me, and I just seem that I have to spend a lot more money to keep this job then I am accustomed to. For example, I still live at home, parents pay most of the bill / groceries (I help pay my share and other expenses). Any advice at all will be very helpful, I certainly value any advice / opinions I get. 

The world of personal finances is very new to me, I never really thought about saving etc...The increase in pay opens up a lot of questions that I never had to worry about before and I would just like to get a grip on things while it's still early on.

I'm in a situation that I'm sure is pretty common. I have a large amount of credit card debt that I'd like to pay off in the best way possible. I feel the situation is somewhat unique in that I do have a couple cards at 0% while others are closer to 30% interest rates. 

Here's my current debt by card:

* $2250 - 0% for another 20 months 
* $2500 - 0% for approximately 10-12 months
* $3500 - ~25% APR
* $2700 - ~25% APR
* $2100 - ~20% APR
* $900 - ~25% APR

As things stand I'm paying the minimums on every card while paying down the highest balance 0% interest rate card before the rate spikes in about a year, and will then proceed to use either the snowball or avalanche method to pay off the rest as I go. 

I'm currently able to put an additional $300-400 per month on whichever card I'm focusing on paying off (in addition to minimum payments), and can occasionally pay more.

My biggest concern is this: With this large amount of debt, the minimum payments alone are upwards of $600 per month. Would I be better off trying to consolidate through a bank / credit union loan?

personalfinance,Two mortgages. What should I do with my second house?,"Here's my situation. I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me what you think the best course of action is. 

My wife and I have positive cash flow and no debt besides our two mortgages:

House A cost $185,000. We got a 30-year mortgage at 5.25% for $165,000 and have a $120,000 left to pay with roughly 15 years left. We rent this house and could probably sell it for around $240,000 now. The rent we receive is just about exactly enough to cover the mortgage payment plus the property management fee. It’s only when repairs are needed that we end up losing money month-to-month.

House B cost $345,000. We got a 30-year at 4.5% for $275,000 and have a $248,000 balance with 25 years left. This is where we live.

We’ve been wondering for a while what to do with that rental house. A friend told us he thinks we’d be crazy to sell it and should hang on to it because our tenants are basically paying our mortgage for us.

Option 1: Keep renting it. So far that arrangement has worked out pretty well, so it’s easy to just keep doing the same thing. Maybe we just see it through until we own the house, at which point it becomes a source of income. There is also the possibility of making money through appreciation that I don’t even know how to estimate.

On the other hand, I’m always aware of how much money we’re paying to banks in mortgage interest. 

Option 2: If we sold that rental house we’d have maybe $120,000 (minus whatever fees) to put to use. An online calculator told us that if we immediately applied $100,000 to our other mortgage, it would save us over $100,000 in interest in the long run and improve our payoff date from 25 to 12 years from now. But we would lose the tax benefits of the other home and lose it as a potential future source of income.

Or maybe that’s not the way to shoot 100K at a mortgage?

Option 3: Do we refinance house B and feed all the proceeds from the sale of house A into the new loan, which would presumably give us a much better principal/interest ratio, or let us decrease the term to maybe 15 years, or both? We’re pretty ignorant about how the details of refinancing or whether it would be a good idea. Our current interest rate is 4.5%, better than what we could get these days.

And I’ll just throw this out there for completeness:

Option 4: Try investing that $120,000 some other way. With extra income—and the money we save from not having to repair the other house—we could pay a lot extra each month on our remaining mortgage. Maybe we could get a better rate of return than the interest rate of the mortgage? We calculated that if we up our payments by $1100 each month, we could have the house paid off in 10 years. $1100 might not be doable, but we could certainly stand to start throwing a few hundred dollars more at that mortgage if we did this. We are pretty disciplined and are already paying a little extra on both mortgages, so I feel confident we wouldn’t just end up squandering the extra income. 

What would you do?

personalfinance,Withdrawing large sum of money.,"I posted a thread requesting advice on help on keeping large sum of money safe without use of banks:

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3jhv5q/need_help_with_keeping_large_sum_of_money_safe/

&amp;nbsp;

Not sure what happened with that thread, but it was a bit difficult to fish through it for pertinent responses. Anyway this is an extremely important topic. I have no plans to keep money in a bank. Keeping money in somebody else's hands to use is out of the question. No matter how much safer anybody claims it is. It is not somebody else's money, and every person has the right and option where they want to store their money. This is about not wanting to use banks to store money.

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to debate about your opinion on how everybody should keep money in FDIC insured bank, please don't respond here. If that's what you want to do with your money, please feel free to store it in a bank. This topic geared to those who do not wish to use any banks or keep any money in the banking system. It's about what the process would be to withdraw a large sum of money, and keep it safe without storing it in a bank. FDIC insured or not. It's about physical cash stored and accessible by the owner of the money. Not stored anywhere else.

&amp;nbsp;

This being said, there is a notice sent out to the feds if anybody withdraws more than a certain amount. Like $10,000. This alone already puts the person in danger. Because what if somebody is corrupt? What if there's a notice sent out, and somebody in the feds is trying to find out where you're taking the money in order to rob you? Even if you hire armored vehicle, they know where the money is being dropped off. And there is potential for danger there as well.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, how can one be safe without being forced to keep money in the bank? My presumption would be the less people who know, the better. And what about the bank? You might not be able to just walk in, and take out as much as you want because they might not have the funds at the branch. Is there a process in which they have a certain amount of time to relinquish cash to you? Surely, they have no right to hold on to your money against your will.

&amp;nbsp;

So there are all kinds of potential dangers that have to be accounted for when withdrawing, and transporting money from the bank. The idea is how to be as safe as possible if storing money in the bank is not an option.

&amp;nbsp;

In my personal case,  I'm getting close to $200,000. I have plans on what I will be doing it to jump start my company to continue to increase my wealth. I'll be spending it all, but continuing to make back more consistently. Only using banks for basic commerce. Storing and depositing only the minimum needed to conduct business transactions. Aside from that, what ever money I am not actually using to conduct business will be held onto by me. Which means I will need an intelligent plan and strategy for the storage and safety aspect.

personalfinance,$70k in student loans forgiven for a disabled spouse and we are trying to stay on top of our situation.,"I'll try to give a brief summary of our current situation:

- I work full time, gross income last year was approx. $65K. My wife does not work due to medical disability and her income with SSDI and long term disability payments was approx. $20K (""take home""). 
- My wife's medical expenses over the last several years have allowed us to itemize.
- Just recently my wife's student loans (approx. $46K &amp; $26K) were forgiven and we were informed we will be receiving a 1099-C from both lenders. 

I searched on this subreddit and found some posts about student loan forgiveness and I checked out the insolvency form. I also spoke with a CPA briefly over the phone about our situation just to get some professional input. I'm also posting here to get any additional insight. Here are a few questions I have:

- We are receiving two 1099-C's that will probably be dated a few weeks or so apart. Insolvency worksheet requires values immediately before forgiveness. Do we have to pick one of the dates or, since they were so close together, can we use both? Smaller loan was forgiven before larger loan. 

- Can I use most recent county appraisal district value as the FMV of my property?

- The loans have been in forbearance for the years that my wife has been out of work. Our budget has adjusted over time to not factor payments in. We have saved some money at times but medical bills prevented large scale savings. 

- We bought a new car this year AND I have had a lot more medical bills this year so I am sure this will at least help reduce our liability somewhat. What else can I do to reduce my liability before the end of the year, even if just a little bit. I am already going to figure out how much we can do without and increase my withholding by that amount.

- I believe we are in a position where we could refinance our house. We would need to roll the closing costs into the new loan, but I am pretty confident we would be approved at a lower interest rate (currently @ 6.5%). The goal would be to reduce monthly payment which could help free up money to be able to better afford a payment plan with the IRS. Would it be better to do it this year? I am not familiar with the tax implications of refinancing.

- How flexible are IRS payment plans? In our current situation we would likely not be able to pay more than $200-300 a month and that would leave very little wiggle room for savings. 

- 1099-C does not list ""medical"" as a reason for forgiveness and I did not see any special mention of it in publication 4681. Is there any kind of program or additional form that might help us given that a) wife can't work due to medical conditions and b) loans forgiven due to disability as a result of said conditions? I fully understand that this **IS** considered income and I am prepared to make arrangements for what we need to pay, but I also know that sometimes there are exclusions or reductions that can occur under special circumstances (at least in general dealings; maybe not with the IRS). 

- We are in TX, which is a community property state, so I don't know that filing separately would be beneficial for us since we have no way to separate ourselves from each others' income and debt.


Still getting our hands around this situation but we've been doing some research. I will probably have more questions but this is a good start I suppose. Thanks in advance for any input.

personalfinance,Credit timing: Auto loan &amp; Credit card application,"Some background: I am 27[m], recently finished my education and started my career, also recently engaged to my longtime girlfriend (living together for 2 years, totally combined finances).

 

My question is about the best order and timing on various credit applications (auto loan and credit cards).


I am in the market for a new (to me) car and researching financing options. I plan to get pre-approved for loans from my Credit Union (account since I was a kid) and a national bank (recently joined my GFs account). That way I can play those two interest rates off of eachother and if a dealership has a better offer then I'll jump on that. I hope to get at least the current promotional rate offered by the bank of 2.24%. 


On top of that, I want to apply for some additional credit cards to build credit long-term and take advantage of rewards. My Credit Karma score is 781, but I only have 3 lines of credit history. I currently have 1 card through my CU ($1000 limit, 9 year history, currently not using at all) and a shared card with the GF that we use for all of our expenses, shared and personal (Capital One VentureOne $9000 limit, 3.75 yr history, rewards are essentially 1.25% back on all purchases). We never carry a balance. Our spending each month ranges from about 3000-4500. My other credit history is a car loan that I paid off 3 years ago. So, I would like to obtain some more credit lines to decrease utilization. The card I am targeting is the AmEx Blue Cash Everyday, mainly because of the gas (2%) and grocery (3%) rewards. There is a ""Preferred"" version of this card with 3%/6% rewards in those categories but a $75 annual fee. I know the extra 3% rewards from our grocery budget alone will cover the fee - any reason I shouldn't do it?


Also, we want to open a travel rewards credit card to try to get enough miles for a flight for our honeymoon next summer. I need to look into it further, but probably will be the AAdvantage or Chase Sapphire Preferred.


I know all of these applications can be completed within an afternoon. Will doing them all at the same time result in only 1 equivalent hard credit pull? Should I do the auto loan first to make sure I get the best rate?

Another question I have is how to best handle shared credit (with spouses, etc.). Is having separate credit lines a good idea? Is there a difference in applying for a credit card individually or with your spouse? 


TL;DR - I am applying for 2 credit cards and an auto loan in the next month. What is the best order, etc.?",finance,1441343100

I recently decided to apply for Income Based Repayment for my federal student loans. Using their calculator, I estimate I can save a good bit by doing so.

During the application process you are redirected to an Irs site that fetches your most recent income tax information. I filed this year of course. I live abroad and make about $30K a year, so while I'm required to file, I am exempt from paying federal taxes on my wages because they do not exceed $90K. The only other information included on my tax return (no dependents, spouse, assets, etc) is my student loan information. I always file a record of interest paid since its is claimable. 

So anyway, when my information was presented form the Irs, my net income was listed as negative $2,500. I can't really imagine where that number comes from, and I don't think it's reflective of my actually net income. 

Does anyone know why my income would be negative? Perhaps a mistake was made when filing? I'm a little panicked so any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1441357984

Long-time lurker here. I want to open up by saying that the help that I got from this subreddit (and r/frugal), needless to say, tremendously changed my financial outlook.


I will cut to the chase and ask you the question that I know some of you can answer with absolute expertise: **what is the best way to get a personal loan to cover a high-interest student loan? (if I should at all?).**


I pay about $1,700 a month for my student loans (graduated payment plan that is not interest-only). I am using avalanche method, but there is one account that I really need to eliminate to save money on interests: a $23,600 account with at 13%, **yes THIRTEEN percent!**


For your reference, the only major purchase that I had was a car from last year that I am on a payment plan for.


The following is my financial portfolio:


**Credit Score**
  
- TransUnion:752

- Equifax:756


**Cash Accounts**

- Bank of America: $1,500

- Chase: $1,500


**Investments**

- 401K at maximum company match of 6%

**Loans Accounts** 

*Credit Cards* (I carry zero balance and each card has 10k+ credit line)

- American Express Blue Preferred
- Bank of America Cash Rewards
- Chase Freedom
- Chase Sapphire 


*Car*

- $25,000 at 1.99%


*Federal Loans* (using avalanche method, graduated payment)

- Perkins: $6,400 at 5.00%
- Stafford A: $2,600 at 6.55%
- Stafford B: $4,500 at 6.55%
- Stafford C: $5,400 at 5.75%
- Stafford D: $5,400 at 5.35%
- Stafford E: $4,500 at 4.25%
- Stafford F: $2,500 at 6.55%
- Stafford G: $2,300 at 6.55%
- Stafford H: $8,100 at 6.55%   


*Private Loans*

- Private A: $27,900 at 5.25%
- Private B: $41,400 at 7.75%
- Private C: $23,600 at 13.00% (crazy right? this was 2009)
- Private D: $19,700 at 9,75% 


After 401K and taxes, I have about $3,500 that come into my account. I have a fixed expense of $3,000 (rent, loans, bills) every month and I also supplement my income with a side job that brings in anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 per month (which I mostly save).

personalfinance,"Suddenly receiving a notice of college debt I don't remember having, to which I have not been alerted, and which is evidently now 60 days late--suggestions?","Hey /r/PersonalFinance,

To make a long story short, from 2009-2010 I had one ill-fated year at private university before I realized what a fool I was to pay so much for a liberal arts education which could come with dedicated practice of my art. In 2011 I was contacted by the university regarding my student loan and they were really pretty awful about it for a school which presents a front of being so caring. They basically demanded every penny up front and I managed to talk them down to a payment of $500 a month, which slayed me, but meant that by April 2012 all I owed was to the federal government--or so I thought. Fast forward to yesterday, I open the mail and what do I find but a notice from www.mycampusloan.com stating I'm 60 days past due on a loan I have no idea I'd had. They haven't contacted me at all since I paid the promissory note--no phone calls, no notice. I've moved three times since then and each time have set up mail forwarding/updated my address with the government, so I'm baffled as to why they weren't able to find it until just now. I should add that this letter was not forwarded, but sent directly to my current address, where I've resided since February 2014. 

The debt collectors were literally no help, I called them to figure out why I haven't heard anything about this and what the debt is for, and they directed me to the school. Evidently it's for $500, but for what, I have no clue at all. I'm extremely concerned that this is going to have a negative effect on my already-spotty credit, and I'm just baffled by its existence to begin with. Should I call the school to request the debt's validity, or write to them? Why wouldn't they have simply added this $500 to the Perkins Loan I paid back in 2011-2012, or even have mentioned it while I was dealing with the Perkins bullshit? Is it even legal that I haven't heard a thing about this debt and yet am now allegedly 60 days late on it? If it is legal--I wouldn't be surprised if it was--how do I prevent this from effecting my credit? Right now I'm working freelance and it's barely enough to cover my bills, and though I can maybe squeeze out an extra $150 for a few months I'm super pissed about this situation and am frankly disgusted by the university's practices and policies regarding student debt. I know that dealing with debt collectors can be a delicate dance, so I defer to you, /r/personalfinance, for your esteemed opinion.

I just graduated pharmacy school and my total loan debt is currently about $123,000 with an average interest rate of 7% (I have several different loans and 3 lenders, the department of education, ACS, AES). I have been looking into various companies regarding re-financing and [Sofi](https://www.sofi.com/) came up several times so I'm considering using them.

If I use the company to do a 5-year payoff, I have two choices: a fixed interest rate of about 4.8% or a variable interest rate of 3.0%. The variable interest rate is dependent on monthly libor, which is basically a rate that is added to the base interest rate, and fluctuates from month to month. This month's libor is 0.2. So, for example, if I were to use variable interest rate this month, my loans would have an interest of approximately 3.0% because the 3.0% that is being offered already includes the month's libor (base interest rate would then be 2.8% + 0.2 libor). If libor changed to about 0.3 in october, then my interest rate would change to 3.1%, and so on. I was working as a paid intern but now that I'm fully certified and have my own store I will be make about 120k a year, possibly more (hourly wage).

So we're going to be purchasing a new car. We know which car we want, we've been to the lot, we've test driven it, we're ready to purchase it, but we're going to need to finance part of the cost of the new car. I'd rather pay cash, but my wife and I have talked a lot about it simply don't have enough in cash to get what we feel like we need for our family.

The insurance company issued the check to us and to CapitalOne on Tuesday, but the check for 1.5k hasn't gotten to us yet (expecting it today), and CapitalOne still showing that the loan isn't paid off because they haven't received their check yet either. I've talked to both the insurance company and CapitalOne and it seems like the only thing we can do is wait for it all to clear up.

Here's my question: how will that previous loan effect my credit? If we wait until everything is squared away and paid off, will it increase our chances of getting a good interest rate?

I'm worried that with it being Labor Day Weekend, it could take another 4-5 days for the loan to be paid off with CapitolOne. If it's in our best interest to wait, we will, but we need a car! Can anyone give some insight?

personalfinance,Vanguard taxable account questions,"Hello /pf!

I'm considering starting a taxable Vanguard account. I'd start with the 3k minimum for [Total US Stock](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&amp;FundIntExt=INT) and then do monthly auto-invest for the long term.

About me:

* Maxing both 401k(it has good funds) and IRA(Vanguard Roth)
* Have almost 1 year expenses in cash (~45k) (stable career in HCOLA)
* Two student loans: 13k @ 3.625% and 8k @ 2.33% (I'm considering paying off the 3.625% loan at an accelerated rate)
* View all accounts as [one portfolio](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement) and try to maximize tax efficiency

I have two concerns:

* [Primary concern] I'm concerned that if I do auto-invest monthly, when I go to sell, I'll have to account for hundreds of individual cost basis calculations. How does this work out in practice?
* [Secondary concern] Starting the taxable account is essentially interest rate arbitrage with the 3.63% loan. In the short term, this is likely a wash from a net-worth perspective and is certainly more risky. Long term, I'd like to have this taxable account on auto-pilot.

Thanks for any thoughts

I know it's not much debt in comparison to some, but it's some I'd like to take care of, and frankly, wish I never acquired.

personalfinance,Private student loans after a divorce. Seeking advice.,"Synopsis:  Sparing the relationship details - I was married for 11 years.  My ex-wife accumulated roughly $95,000 in student loan debt during the last 3 years of our marriage.  This included ~ $33,000 in private student loans.  The remainder were federal student loans.  We divorced in April 2014 in Montana.  She and my daughter now live in Texas, I live in Missouri.

In the divorce, all of the federal loans were given to her (of course).  I was given a total of exactly $12,000 of the private student loan debt, with her being given the remaining $21,000.  As soon as the divorce was finalized, I wrote a check and paid off my portion of the private loans (the $12K mentioned).  At the time of the divorce, I was making ~28K, and she had taken a job making ~60K.

I'm now making nothing other than military disability pay ($407/mo).  I'm in school full-time which is being paid for 100% by the VA (chapter 31 program).  

My ex wife has quit her job, and she and my daughter are living with her boyfriend in TX who is paying her living expenses.  She has put the private student loans in deferral, and has not paid a penny on them.  She told me last week that she's pregnant with his child, and that she's considering filing bankruptcy since she can't find a job (she's the type who has never held a job more than a few months - even though she has an occupational therapy degree - she just refuses to do work).

If she files bankruptcy, I'm assuming that Sallie Mae is going to come after me for the balance on the private loans that I am cosigned on ($21K).  Do I have any options to protect myself? 

I have $0 debt of my own, and am blessed to be living with my mother who is paying all of my expenses while I finish my own degree.   I’m getting re-married in the spring, and am terrified that I’m going to bring a huge financial burden into a new marriage.  Thank you for your help and advice, even if it’s simply “Tough Shit Sagus, you’re screwed!”

personalfinance,"In this environment, borrowing from 401(k) to pay student debt a good idea?","Hi, I know this subject has been touched upon before, but so far a lot of the discussion has left me somewhat dissatisfied.

I invest enough in my 401(k) to meet my employer's match (6% for a 3% match).

I am close to paying off some student debt (about $10,000) at an already re-financed, consolidated fixed interest rate of 4.5%. 

Job stability is very strong and I foresee no issues servicing other obligations (rent, etc.) in the foreseeable future. 

I think it would be a pretty good idea to borrow $10,000 from my 401(k) to pay off the student debt now, and then pay back the 401(k) loan plus ~4% interest (which is ultimately paid to myself) over the course of the next 12 months (which is when I would have finished off my student loan as well; and I'll note that in each case I'm paying back the relevant loan with after-tax dollars). I think this would be true even when equities are returning a solid ~8% return, but especially true now in times of market volatility.

In good times, an ~8% return means I would be losing out on the ~3.5% delta between what I would be making in my 401(k) and what I would save by paying back student debt at a 4.5% interest rate. But I think that conclusion misses two counterpoints: (1) eventually you'll be taxed on that 8% gain when you're eligible to begin withdrawing in retirement; and (2) any sane asset allocation scheme would split the 401(k) portfolio between equity type securities like stocks (assuming a youngish person, 60-80%) and safer investments like treasuries and bonds (the remaining 20-40%). The effect of (1) above means that you're really only talking about a 5-6% return on that investment, depending on your average tax rate at retirement. The effect of (2) above means that you're further reducing the hypothetical ""8%"" return on that investment after averaging in the low yields (sorry, I don't know what these yields look like, 1-3%??). Happy to consider and accept any criticism of my math or assumptions, but I think that would ultimately mean that your expected returns on that $10,000 of 401(k) funds would really be something like an after-tax, weighted average of 4%. The argument becomes even more persuasive if you assume that rather than taking out a 401(k) loan on your portfolio on a pro-rata basis, you instead only take out a 401(k) loan on the ""safe"", low-yielding investments to repay student debt, the payment of which represents a guaranteed 4.5% return. That way, you preserve your 8% equity-like return and instead sacrifice the bond-like assets that are making you much less than 4.5%, even before what it would be taxed at (and remember you don't get taxed on money you save when prepaying debt, after all it is not considered ""canceled debt"" by the IRS).

So I think even in good times, this would be at least a wash, and since I have strong job security (so I don't have to fear certain risks such as having the 401(k) loan called in upon being laid off, etc.), the psychological benefits of no longer having that debt, and real economic benefits of having a slightly better credit score, means that I should take out a 401(k) loan to pay my remaining student debt, and repaying that 401(k) loan over the course of a year, as described above. 

In crappy times like we're in now, it seems like an even better argument, but I don't want to rely on that argument too much since you could very well (or maybe not!) expect the markets to return to normal within a few months. In any event, what do people think? Am I (and I'm really only talking about my specific situation here, but I think it has broad applications to a lot of people, especially when you consider that student loan debt is not dischargeable and also at a lower interest rate than credit card debt) missing something here?

personalfinance,[US] I have not filed taxes in years and got accepted for a good paying job working for my state. They said I need to file before I can officially get hired. Questions.,"For the last 4 or 5 years I have worked as a contract worker from home doing IT work. Some companies I have done work for has given me a 1099. Some have not. I have not filed state or federal taxes for 2011, 2012, 2013, or 2014. After missing one year due to lack of income and complexity of living in multiple states, cash jobs, etc the following year was difficult to file, then after that it just became an overwhelming mess I didn't want to deal with. Since all my income goes to my bank and paypal I was hoping one day I'd just receive notice from the IRS with a total due or notice they were going to start garnishing my wages or something.

So. For the last two years I was working for a large company as a contract worker and was 'laid off' in June and decided it was time to start working a proper job. Applied, interviewed, and got accepted for a good position with my State. After I turned in more paperwork I got a call saying that I need to work with the Department of Revenue to file **as I can not work for the job I got hired for until I file.**

So, I have printed off the IT-40EZ and 1040EZ for these years. I'm aware and accept the fact I owe *a lot* of money, but had questions on how I can expect this to play out.

I can not afford an accountant now, so I am doing this all on my own with very little instruction or knowledge and filing in an urgent manner.

In 2014 I earned about $37,000. $22,000~ from a contract job and $15,000~ doing sidework with no 1099 available for this. After filing my 1040EZ I owe just shy of $5,000 for one year alone. That seems a bit high to me. I have no idea how on earth I am supposed to write things off since I have worked from home, I was told things like itnernet, cellphone, computer, food and other stuff I had to buy to work could be written off. True? How do I do this?

I'm so fucking lost right now and fear that I am going to end up overpaying by a significant amount because it is URGENT that I get this in mail immediately and get it filed otherwise I will not be able to work this great job. I start the job on the 14th so only have 9 more days to file...

I'm a single dude, no dependants, flaky reporting of income due to doing work for random companies, some of which gave me a 1099 and some that did not. All money has been directly deposited into my bank or into PayPal so even if no 1099 exists, a record of the money does in these accounts.

Forex,SGD plummeting ahead of Singapore General Election (11 September).,"Singaporean here.

It's going to be one of the most hotly contested election in perhaps the last 20 - 30 years. This didn't happen overnight of course, and has been building up in the last few elections where we saw an upwards trend in support for the opposition parties (as opposed to the PAP, who has maintained a one-party rule in Singapore since the 60s). If the trend is upheld, we will likely be seeing 50 - 50 fights in a number of constituencies, something perhaps considered unthinkable for a country whose democracy-label is often written between quotation marks.

This could really be the tipping point for the oppositions, whom so far has struggled to find a voice in parliament. 

That said, the incumbent PAP is synonymous with business and investment friendly politics. It is strongly associated with economic, wealth and pretty much the reason why Singapore is the wealthiest in Asia. Unfortunately, it is also the reason why Singapore is the most expensive city in the world. 

Dissent is at an all time high, and anti-PAP sentiments permeates our entire society.

Our central bank-equivalent, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has already spent $34 billion since july to prop up the currency. Our monetary tool of choice is exchange rate [which is floated against a weighted basket of trade-linked currencies. (Props to /u/InvilidUsername for pointing out my mistake here)], since interest rate is largely ignored.

If the political landscape remains relatively undisturbed, it is likely for SGD to regain some footing. Else, it will likely plunge a lot further as we, as a nation, will be stepping into unknown territories and it is anybody's guess whether Singapore will still be relevant in the next few decades.",finance,1441447252

The US economy added 173,000 jobs in August, below economists’ predictions of 217,000, according to the US Department of Labor’s latest jobs report released Friday. The labor force participation rate remained at 62.6 percent for a third month—the lowest rate since October 1977.

While payroll figures were worse than expected, the official jobless rate fell to 5.1 percent, the lowest since April 2008. Additionally, job gains for July and June were both revised upward by 30,000 and 14,000 respectively.

The release of the jobs report sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 278 points, or 1.7 percent on Friday. The Standard and Poor’s 500 lost 1.5 percent of its value, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.1 percent. This followed last week’s sell-off in which the Dow and the S&amp;P both lost 5.8 percent and the Nasdaq lost 6.8 percent.

The August jobs report comes amidst a mounting crisis in the global economy, fueled by a slump in commodities prices, slowing economic growth in China, and concerns over the creditworthiness of emerging market economies.

Friday’s report is the last before the mid-September Federal Reserve Board meeting. The US central bank had previously indicated that it would consider at the meeting raising interest rates from their current level of near zero.

The decline in the US stock market reflected concerns by Wall Street that the jobs figures do not send a clear enough signal that the Fed will delay raising rates at its next meeting. As Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics wrote in a research note cited in the New York Times, “As far as we’re concerned, the September meeting is a 50-50 toss-up.”

The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near zero for more than six years, sending trillions of dollars of cheap credit into the financial system. These policies have led to a ballooning of the stock market, as well as the wealth of the financial elite, while doing nothing to expand real economic output.

Financial markets in Europe also closed lower Friday, with large losses due to continuing fears over the global economy that were not eased by the US jobs report. The German DAX closed down 2.71 percent, and the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost around 2.5 percent.

These declines came a day after Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, revised expected growth rates downward for the Eurozone and announced that the ECB stands ready to expand its quantitative easing program in response to turbulence in the global economy.

Some commentators have praised the 5.1 percent official employment figure as a sign of a recovery from the post-2008 recession. The figure, down from 5.3 percent last month, is the lowest since April 2008.

The official jobless rate, however, ignores an estimated 3.47 million potential workers who, “because of weak job opportunities, are neither employed nor actively seeking a job,” according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). Were these workers counted, the unemployment rate would be 7.2 percent.

The EPI also noted Friday that the growth in US jobs is only just enough to keep up with population growth. It wrote, “A great example of just how slow this job recovery is going is the flat prime-age employment-to-population ratio. This means the economy is only adding enough jobs to keep up with prime-age population growth—nothing more, nothing less.”

The Labor Department’s report states that there are 6.5 million part-time workers who wish they could be working more, but due to economic reasons are unable to acquire a full-time job. A total of 10.3 percent of the workforce are either unemployed, marginally attached to the workforce, or are underemployed, according to Friday’s report.

While the economy added jobs in the service sector, the manufacturing sector lost 17,000 jobs. Job losses were also concentrated in the mining sector, with 9,000 jobs lost. Since the beginning of the year, 90,000 jobs have been eliminated in the mining and logging category, which includes the oil and gas industry. This sharp decline has been driven by the plummeting of oil prices as well as other primary goods. Recent data showing the contraction of Chinese manufacturing will only compound this slowdown.

Job growth was focused in the lower-paid sectors of health care and social assistance, which added 56,000 jobs in August. Additionally, the number of jobs in restaurants and bars increased by 26,000, business and professional services by 33,000 and financial services by 19,000.

These figures, showing declines in the relatively higher-paying manufacturing sector and increases in lower-paid sectors, conform to the general trend of a “low-wage recovery” over the past six years. The National Employment Law Project (NELP) reported this week that real wages had declined by 4 percent since the start of the recession. The lowest-paid sections of the workforce were hit the hardest, with those making less than about $11 an hour seeing a 5.7 percent fall in their wages.

An earlier report by the NELP found that a disproportionate amount of jobs created during the so-called economic “recovery” pay less than $13 an hour. While 1.85 million low-wage jobs were created over the past six years, 1.83 million medium-wage and high-wage jobs were lost during that time.",finance,1441457851

First time posting here, so please pardon any missing information or formatting errors; I'll address them as pointed out if need be.

Ok; I'm 25, and I've just finished my Bachelor's of Education degree here in Canada, and I'm now $30k deep in student loan debt. Due to some recent circumstances I've decided I need a change of pace and scenery (and I also need to work of course). So to get all of these taken care of in one swoop, I'm beginning a job teaching at an international school in northern China in about a month. My pay will be an annual salary of $45k CAD, and I pay both Chinese and Canadian income tax on that amount, though the Chinese tax is deductible as I understand it. My take-home pay at the pay period of each month (the 15th) is pegged right around $2800-$3000 CAD.

I'm working to create a budget with YNAB, and my biggest expense will be rent, which depending on the size of the apartment should be no more than $500 per month, and could be significantly lower than that.

If I were to budget $1k/month as living expenses, for instance, how should I go about using the remainder to address financial needs for the future?

personalfinance,In need of some serious help before things spiral too far out of control,"So I need some help, PF.

I'm currently in a pretty bad situation debt-wise, and need some help trying to figure out how to get on top of this thing. I'm already aware that I've probably made some bad decisions, so please don't chastise me too much on that count. I did screw up, somewhere along the way.

My primary job is working 8-5, 40 hour weeks, bringing home around 23520 a year before taxes. I have great benefits there, including already paid-for health insurance, dental, and vision. I also have a 401k set up, my employer will match up to 5% of my contributions. I live here, so there is no daily commute for me.

Rent is fixed at $675/mo. I have a monthly car payment of $388 (around $19k financed), and car insurance of $220. My car insurance is extremely high as I'm under 25, have had no previous insurance, and am a new driver. I have a monthly personal loan payment of $149 (financed $2500, interest rate 32% O_O). Monthly phone bill of $78. I managed to completely pay off my secondary credit card, however my primary card with Wells Fargo holds a balance of almost $1500 with monthly payments around $70. I'm spending next to nothing in groceries, and scrapping by with what I have. My car is a hybrid so I'm spending no more than $40/mo in gas.

My part-time job was seasonal, and my season concluded this past week. It's obvious that I can't stay afloat with just one job now, so I have already been looking for another. Someone suggested driving for Uber. From what I understand the majority of PF pushes for cash cars, instead of financing. The selection where I live is awful, and I looked for months before biting the bullet. Public transportation is not available here, so that also sucks.

personalfinance,Paying down debt with favourable exchange rate? (US)(CAN),"Hi all: 

My wife and I are currently working in the US, and have student debt in Canada. Our debts (~30K) have lowish interest rates (~5%) so we've been focusing on paying minimums so that we can build up our ""emergency fund"" stateside (currently at ~10k, a little over 3mo salary for one of us) and contribute to retirement. This is a priority especially with a baby coming in 3mos, and wanting to have a little extra breathing room in the war chest for that. 

However, with the Canadian dollar low, we get a reasonable conversion sending money back home (1.28 to 1) so it seems like free money if we take advantage of it.  Basically, we're wondering if that should change our thinking about paying off debt: should we take a chunk of our emergency fund to take advantage of this rate, or stick to our current strategy?",finance,1441463512

personalfinance,Saving at 19,"Hey PF, I've decided I want to start saving money early on so I don't fuck myself later and I wanted some advice.

My living situation is about as good as I could hope for right now. My boyfriend and I live together. We work in the same company each are making $1300 per month after taxes. His dad drives truck and wanted a house for when he's home maybe 4 times a year so we are living almost totally free of bills. I owe my boyfriend about $3,000 from early in our relationship when I was stuck part time at my job during my probationary period. I also owe $600 to the electric company from our first apartment that basically lacked insulation (electric was $1300 for heating over the winter. We left in January.) That's being paid back at $100 per month.

Anyway we plan on living here for a few years until we have a down payment for a house. I'm a grand total of $3600 in debt. I have $110 in bills. I make $1300 per month.

I need to get everything paid off and start saving, but I'm not sure what the best was to go about starting a savings is. I'm very bad with money
 If I have it it gets spent of something. I kind of want to find another bank with a good interest rate and put my extra money in with direct deposit so I don't even have a chance to touch it. Is that a good idea even though it won't ""teach me to be responsible with my money""? What would be a good interest rate for a saving account? Does anyone have an suggestions?

I'm also thinking about getting into 401K through my job when enrollment is open again. I have no idea how it works, though. I'm sure I can get it mostly figured out when the time comes and with my boyfriends help since he has one as well. What happens to it if I leave my job though? Do I just get what's there at that point? Do I only get back what I put in? Is it held somewhere?

Also we've kept our finances separate entirely as we've seen no point in putting them together. Is there a benefit to this we're somehow now aware of that makes people decide this is somehow a good idea?

All this feels kinda scary, but the two of us are in a very good place to actually be saving money right now, and I know if I waste it I'm going to regret it big time later on. We have an actual chance of being able to move and buy a house between the two of us, and I'd like to be able to put money into some kind of an investment for the next 20 or so years at least.

If I get an average 8% return on investment for retirement over 30 years, won't it be better to invest than pay off the loans to shorten the 10 years of minimum payments? In other words, isn't the compound interest gained over 30 years better than my return on the loan?",finance,1441492704
personalfinance,I was taking advantage of at a Car Dealership.,"Ok so the backstory is that I have been working hard to save up a good chunk of money to buy a car. Well the day finally has come when I feel comfortable enough to buy a car. So I go to the lot and start chatting with a dealer. I test drive three cars, lets call them; Car A, Car B, and Car C. Well I fell in love with Car A which was the pricey one of the bunch, but was reasonable if I got a good interest rate on. Mean while Car B was eh and did not appease me at all and was still pricey, and Car C was the cheapest and I did not like it all. I felt unsafe in due to its size. Well we go inside and start running the numbers and scenarios for Car A. We spent hours upon hours dealing for Car A and it was just a bit of my range. So I went out to the lot to look at other cars to see if anything else would catch my eye. Before I even get done assessing the second car the guy from Finance comes out and says that he got the numbers for ""The Car"" down to my range. I am beyond excited and I go back into his office he tells me that he got the ""orice down by texting"" the bank financing the car. So I sign all the documents that are mandated when buying a new car. I am the happiest man ever. Well I walk outside his office and I am about to leave and then the dealer calls me over to his desk to talk about the last details like when I can pick it up and what not. He quickly says that the reason the price went down was because I had actually just bought Car C. I had not been told whatsoever that Car C was what I was signing for. I asked what do I do? He said there was nothing to be done besides void it out. I want more. I was lied to and taken advantage of. I was never informed that my purchase had been changed.

personalfinance,How can we manage debt effectively and invest wisely as Canadians living in the U.S. for an indeterminate period of time? [Job+401k(?) in U.S.; debts in Canada],"Hi.  I’ve read every single relevant thing in the sidebar and in the wiki beforehand.  I’m sorry this is a bit long but it seems our situation is somewhat complex.

I am 26, my wife is 24, and we are both Canadian.  We have been living in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I work as a Software Engineer, for almost a year.  I have a work visa (TN-1) that is tied to my job, and my wife has a spouse visa (TD-1) that does not permit her to work.  I make $105k base salary (and some stock options (ESOs) that will start vesting soon, that may or may not ever have any value), and take home $5.2k monthly after taxes, insurance premiums, pre-tax transit amounts, and 401k contribution.

For several years, until recently, I was a grad student, making $20k (CAD) and racking up some debt in the form of a student loan (with the government) and a student line of credit (with a credit union).  The line of credit has a balance of $CAD 16.5k (~$USD 12.5k) out of 20k available, a minimum payment of $CAD 55 (~$USD 40), and an interest rate of 3.2%.  The student loan has a balance of $CAD 8.5k (~$USD 6.5k), a minimum payment of $CAD 100 (~$USD 75), and an interest rate of 3.2%, but with mandatory life insurance, for an effective rate of 3.92%.  See [unbury.us summary](http://unbury.us/#monthly_payment=1000&amp;name_0=Line of credit&amp;balance_0=16500&amp;payment_0=55&amp;rate_0=3.2&amp;name_1=Student loan&amp;balance_1=8500&amp;payment_1=100&amp;rate_1=3.92&amp;).  Interest paid on the student loan is admissible for a federal non-refundable 15% tax credit and a provincial non-refundable 20% tax credit, neither of which applies to the line of credit.  I’m finding it pretty hard to figure out which loan makes the most sense to pay off first, taking into account both the math of it and the implications of government loan vs. line of credit with a private institution.

We have no other debt of any kind, but also basically no savings of any kind.

A complicating factor that pervades all of our personal finance matters: moving money from the U.S. to Canada or vice versa costs money.  I’ve recently finally found a solution that costs way less than others, but that’s still around 1% of the amount transferred and very much worth considering.  There’s also the matter of the ups and downs of the CAD–USD exchange rate.  (In fact, due to the large drop in value of the Canadian dollar, I now make $CAD 20k more than I did when I started a year ago.)

So, the consensus seems to be that an emergency fund should be our first focus.  Mostly due to ridiculous housing costs in this area, our monthly living expenses, under the assumption that we are both unemployed, are easily $3500.  We generally have something like 3–6k in checking at any given time.  I was thinking aggressively paying down the line of credit was a good call, as it can also serve as an emergency fund, but it sounds like that’s not recommended, as it could be “taken away” at a “moment’s notice.”  It does *feel* wrong to me to have thousands of dollars lying around just in case when my debt could be that much smaller and racking up less interest.  But feel free to convince me otherwise.

Now, my employer very recently launched a 401k program through Vanguard, but with no match.  I think there are some pretty good options in there, but I don’t really know anything beyond what I’ve read about 401ks recently.  Here are my [options](http://imgur.com/a/AXMaC).  I was defaulted to a 5% contribution in the “Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Inv” option, and have $800 in the account so far.  What should I do here?  Is it wise to invest in a 401k with substantial-but-not-crippling debt with interest rates in the 3.2–3.9% range?  We also don’t have a long-term plan, but the assumption is that we’ll return to Canada at some point in the next 2–5 years – but who knows.  I’ve tried reading up on the ramifications of that as far as converting the 401k into some kind of Canadian equivalent, but I’m a bit lost there too.  If it turns out moving back to Canada in a few years means I'll lose any benefits of investing in a 401k now, maybe it makes more sense to invest that money elsewhere, or pay my debts even more aggressively.

Somewhat relevant: we should be starting a green card (permanent residence) application process soon with the help of my employer, and if that ever works out my wife will be able to work as well.

So my question is generally: what do you recommend I do, in what order, given all this?  So far I’m inclined to (1) keep contributing 5% to the 401k (no idea which investment option though); (2) keep no more than 1–2 months’ living expenses in our U.S. checking account; and (3) send as much money as I can every month back to Canada to pay down my line of credit and make the minimum payment on my student loan.

financialindependence,Pay down mortgage or let it ride?,"With my interest rate being 3.65, would it be more prudent to put the extra 200 a month in some sort of account? Or should I strive for paying it off 10 years earlier like I have been?

Thanks guys. I'm still not as frugal as I should be, but I do save 20% each month and pay 200 extra on mortgage. Before /r/financialindependence I was only saving 6% and had several outstanding loans. Down from 4 to 1 besides mortgage with the other paid off in Oct!!",finance,1441505559
politics,To Vote or Not to Vote that’s the Real Question for Most of us in 2016 .,"Are all those candidates even worth to vote for? Are their agendas coincide with what we want or need in any fundamental way right now in the midst of the economic crisis papered over with the FED policies.

Are we voting against our own long term interests? Casting our vote, are we hoping for lesser evil or make a rational decision as civic duty requires? Are we trading our liberty for illusory security to obtain neither?

These are the fundamental questions we have to ask ourselves before we cast our vote.

This is a quote from the post linked below:

*Gullibility of most of American people never ceases to amaze me. For example, most of those who seem to support Trump are just expressing their disgust for the meaningless political puppet show what the so-called campaign really is all about. It applies to Sanders sympathizers as well. It is indirect protest against absurd choice between Clinton 2.0 and Bush 3.0 that will be forced on all of us one way or another.

Trump lunatic himself lent his name to “none of the above lunatics” choice. If he steps out of the line at critical moment, he will be crushed by fellow oligarchs such as Koch Bros and the MSM having so big personal baggage, easy to attack. That’s why you will not see Trump attacking FED, banksters or Israel and MIC since multitude of his enemies have a mountain of dirt against him to bury him in it. Trump as well as Sanders will have two choices at some point: to be kick out of the race or to fold which they could and would easily do.*

Forex,Short on AUD/JPY,"So these are just my opinions on some short term fundamentals, if anyone has a different view, or more insightful information, comment and let me know : ).

I've been short on AUDUSD over the past couple of weeks as it has been a pretty sure bet, and it has profited well. However I have looked over charts, and potential profits if I had of shorted the AUDJPY, and there has been almost twice the movement down. I see this trend continuing and will be looking for jump into short AUDJPY after any short term rallies.

With the continuing strength of the JPY to the USD, and the bearish views on the AUD in general. AUDJPY is looking a pretty good risk-reward scenario for going short.
  
**AUD**  
  
Keep an eye on commodity prices continuing to head south, and any negative news from china, as that will put downward pressure on the AUD. Australia is putting out some pretty negative data in terms of its own growth, if that continues the RBA is likely to make another interest rate cut. Australia seems to be following closely in Canada's footsteps economy wise, and it won't surprise me to see Australia's first recession in 2016 after almost 3 decades of solid growth. Big reasons for this are our resource exports, and china making up more than 30% of all exports.
  
The AUD is in a bit of a free fall at the moment and could snap back at any moment. But in my opinion any rallies will be short lived and should be viewed as buying opportunities.  

**JPY**
  
For JPY strength, keep an eye on US and Japanese equities, as they seem to be pretty correlated at the moment, and any news from the BOJ

**USD**

After Fridays data, the fed probably isn't going to raise rates this month, so the market is probably going to price that in over the next couple of weeks, and the USD will move sideways or down. If they do raise hikes, I see some pretty serious stock market volatility, USD strength against emerging market currencies, and traders jumping to the JPY to wait out the mark turmoil. So if the fed hikes I see USD and JPY going up.

personalfinance,Will getting married impact my income based loan repayments?,"My partner and I are in a very committed relationship. We've been living together for years. The only thing stopping us from tying the knot is that we're not sure how that will affect my student loans. 

I have a significant amount of federal student loans and I am currently on an income based repayment plan. On the plan I'm on, the unpaid remainder of my loan will be forgiven in about twenty years. (Yes, I realize I will have to pay taxes on that. Yes, I realize that paying off my loans sooner is a better choice.)

My partner has no debt at all. My student loans are my only debt. 

We're worried that if we get married I would no longer qualify for income based repayments and that my minimum payments would be raised because of her income. She makes quite a bit more than me and I don't want my burden to become her burden. Paying off my loans is something we both care about and want to get taken care of, but we worry that if we have some unexpected financial catastrophe I'll be stuck with minimum payments I can't make.

stocks,Thoughts on Next FOMC meeting on 16-17 September? Rate hike or no?,"Just wanting to see some insight from other people. 
Are you going to play the next FOMC meeting? What are your opinions on what will happen and how will you plan to profit from it? 

I was discussing this with another Redditor about this, and I basically explained why I don't believe they will raise Rates at all in 2015. Personally I will build a gold + gold miner etf position prior to the meeting, which I will sell after the spike.

If youre interested here's briefly what i had said: 
*My personal opinion is that they will not raise rates in 2015. The coming meeting will likely be Yellen speaking with rhetoric and yet again that they are data dependant and still lack enough economic strength or whatever reason. I Look at US economic data &amp; compare them to other time periods. The US economy is not doing signifcantly better than around 2009 and taking that into account there is not much chance of a rate hike. Infact the very purpose of a rate hike is to subdue an economy thats growing too fast, for the reasons like high inflation (from demand pull). The US is certainly not growing at such a rate that it requires a rate hike. Back in the 08 crisis, Bernanke stated himself that the purpose of QE was to inflate the markets to create a wealth effect and therefore increasing aggregate demand. So our current 'bull market' in US stocks is ***strongly** facilitated by cheap credit and injected liquidity. I believe any rate hike will be similar to a popping of a bubble and create a bear market for equities. 
You can say 'the US economy has survived rate hikes in the past, whats to say that it wont survive one now?'. Well yes, just like in 2005 when the Fed started raising rates from 1.5% to 5.5%, equities just kept going higher. But Do you really think the effect will be the same? You must compare the surrounding fundamentals when comparing. Increasing interest rates from 1.5% is **much** more different to raising rates from practically zero %. 
Consider this;. has the US economy ever had a precedent for zero % rates? No. This is a historical first. We've had zero % for around 7 years now. That is also the longest time without a rate hike in US HISTORY. Not raising rates is the safer option as it's not economically viable to raise rates nor is it Politically viable - It is uncharted territory and I dont believe the Fed will want to be held responsible for a market downturn.",finance,1441540125

So, I went to look at some cars with the intention I would use some of my savings (1.7k) to put down and then put another 3k down when the insurance settlement comes in. was trying to go no higher than 10-11k for a car, because I'm also trying to put money as side for a home. 

The problem I'm having is that I financed through a small dealership with my last car, and despite being paid off, it wasn't reported. So I have no credit history for a car and despite my excellent credit rating, the banks are offering me crazy interest rates of 22%. 

My parents are suggesting to take the loan, do this for a year and refinance. (Do banks refinance used cars?) on my end, I'm going to speak to my own bank about a loan Monday morning, since I've had my account with them over 5 years.

personalfinance,To go bankrupt or let time heal the financial wound?,"This is a throwaway account, so that I can be as transparent as possible to get the best possible advice. 

Three years ago, my life was completely upended.  For the previous 15 years, I had owned a few companies with varying degrees of success.  My last company had been operating for 10 years.  I was the single shareholder of this consulting business, but I became increasingly fatigued by being in the center of all revenue activities and wanted to build a company that “made money while I slept.”   

By 2012, I had racked up quite a bit of debt after launching a couple of failed efforts. I had been able to get a line of credit from a local bank that eventually grew to ~$450K.  Even at that, I felt good about our long-term prospects.  The company had one large client on a five-year contract that provided a lot of stability, and I had been contracted to write a college textbook, which came with a sizeable advance ($250K split between myself and a co-author).  In the early part of 2012, I had come up with a business idea and brought in a large institutional partner (providing ~$125K in commercial real estate build out) and private angel investor ($250K). In addition to this debt, I had two Amex cards, one personal and one business, with $30K and $5K in balances.  I personally signed for all of this debt, with the exception of the commercial real estate. 

My role in the textbook was to write the first manuscript, and I wrapped that up in May of 2012, and we were set to launch the new company in the summer.  Let’s just say that I was a very busy man. 

This is when everything went awry. 

I had gone to the doctor and was put on new medication in the first part of June 2012.  I was single at the time and working really long hours.  When this new medication kicked in, I started to sleep less and less, until for 13 days I didn’t sleep more than 15 minutes a day.  Long story short, I had a massive psychotic break that led to a series of hospitalizations over the following few months.  Unfortunately, this break played out in a very public forum in front of my clients, business partners, family, and friends.  

When I emerged, I was jacked up with so many medications – I couldn’t see straight.  Over the following months, I lost everything.  No exaggeration. In the midst of my meltdown, I gave or sold everything – including a two-decade collection of hundreds of books and my grand piano.  By the beginning of 2013, I was forced to stop paying on all of my debt.  In my early 40s, I found myself living in my mother’s basement with no more clients, book deal, possessions, or professional network.  Eventually, I even gave my car back to the bank. My student loan went into default and collection ($145K).  

Since I have nothing and this medical crisis was well documented, none of the debtors took me to court with the exception of Amex, and they eventually dropped their suit.  The federal gov’t did seize my $1,400 tax return this year, because of my student loan. 

From 2013-2014, I made about ~$35K / year in a low-level sales job.  I realized I needed to climb back out and get something more suited to my experience, so I wrote a white paper and started consulting again.  One of my clients hired me fulltime four months ago.  I make $70K / year in salary with a 20% potential bonus.  The company is growing, and I think over the next couple of years that I have the potential to make $90K + bonus.  On a scale of 1-10, I would rate this professional opportunity a 6-7.  I moved into an apartment a few months ago (~$1,400 with rent and utilities) and live close enough to work that I don’t need a car – not that I could afford one.  

About a year ago, I went to a bankruptcy lawyer, and he recommended that I go through Chapter 7.  That said, I have two years of company taxes to file for, and I have not had the money to pay an accountant.  These will be filed by the end of this year or early next year, depending on the level of complexity / cost. At which time, I will be able to go bankrupt. 

Now, here are my questions…  

- Should I go through bankruptcy or just let time heal the financial wounds?  It is my understanding that after a certain period of time companies cannot attempt to collect on debt.  

- I have a very, very small footprint now, so should I look at this time as a weird sort of opportunity?  I always had thought about doing a PhD in the machine-learning field.  Would this be a good time to consider a PhD?   I am little worried that if I stay on my existing professional path that I will not achieve a lot of the “bigger” goals I have had throughout my life.  

- If I do go back to do a PhD, what process might I need to go through to get in good standing with the federal gov’t regarding my student loans?

My wife and I have recently gone from 120k a year of income to a a 2016 projection of around 230-250. In addition we just sold a condo we bought 1 year ago for 180k and sold it for 300k. So now we have around 100k equity sitting around and I see a few options.

1) We bought a new house and we can refi out from under an FHA loan with a 3.7% rate. But because it was FHA we are paying PMI. One thing to note is it would suck up the full 100k to hit 20% down.
2)Pay off my wife's 35k in student debt with interest rates ranging from 5-7%
3)Invest a portion of this money in the market and hope we gain more than we pay in interests on our out standing debts.
4)Investment property?

The only other debts we have is a combined 40k in auto loans at a 2% rate which I find very reasonable and the least of our worries.

Bitcoin,"Hodling (hoarding) is how Bitcoin will scale. It drives the price up, which attracts new fiat conversion. But the way to bring in more hodlers is spending (What?).","Like the rest of you, I've fallen down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. Me/Why? Because it can a) destroy the ills of/what has almost killed me twice, the petrodollar (9.11/Iraq, see www.twitter.com/markfinelli) b) make us ridiculously wealthy in 5-10 years. 

So, I think about Bitcoin a lot. Bitcoin will scale. Why not do it more efficiently and stronger? So, in the simplest bullet points possible, my idea (note: this idea is broad, with many details to be worked out).

1) droves of wealthy people live off investment income. Unfortunately, I never had a trust fund, but growing up in Westchester County, NY and going to Hampden-Sydney, it seemed as if everyone else did. In order to get wealthy persons and the institutions that represent them to venture into Bitcoin, we need a 6%, capital locked in for two to four years, ""CD"" like instrument. People will hoard the principal and spend the income (and hoard more). There is not a debt instrument that can be more exciting to high net worth families than Bitcoin (because principal gonig to the moon, and thus interest payments going to the moon). But there must be one caveat regarding interest payments (explained below) for it to spur more hodling.

2) Margin interest rates, credit cards, lines of credit in general are/can be higher than 10%, sometimes much higher. There is a spread to capture in the middle for the issuer.

3) An exchange/vault wallet company like Coinbase that is also a merchant services company, or partnership between Bitpay and Circle (or, everyone working together) will sweep 1% of monthly 6% into a ""Bitcoin Spend"" wallet (of your monthly interest payment). These funds must be spent with a Bitcoin merchant (again, any Coinbase merchant, or a Foldapp or Purse.io type of company, etc.) and/or that money is sent to a predetermined bitcoin accepting 501(c)(3) of your choice, for a deductible event. Simply, there is no hodling this 1% of interest as per agreement with the issuer.

4) Merchants will have reasons not flip 100% immediately into fiat. 

Merchants will hoard some bitcoin for interest, and, through the same market forces that force consumers to spend/donate bitcoin as stated above, merchants will spend on B2B. Circle closed.

Additionally, such actions will spur more merchants to accept bitcoin, and so on, on so on (older people are hearing that 70s shampoo commercial in their heads). Now there is a number of really exciting reasons for merchants to accept bitcoin in addition to lower transaction fees.

5) Hodling goes up everywhere because spending. Exchange rate at $10,000 per by the 2nd halving (July 2016).

personalfinance,How should I reduce my tax withholding after my wife took a big pay-cut?,"So, this may be better suited to r/tax, but I have grown to really appreciate the r/personalfinance community so I thought I'd try to post here first.

My wife has been accepted to a residency program, that while prestigious, means a significant reduction in our gross income for the year.  I'd like to update our tax withholding accordingly to improve our cash flow to pay for some recent auto repairs without dipping too far into our e-fund.  

It looks like she will be making ~30k$ less than I predicted at the beginning of the year and we will overpay fed. tax by ~3.2k$ and state tax by ~3.2k$ by the end of the year.  After some investigation, either by my mistake or the mistake of payroll, the state deduction (California) was recorded as a as-single tax rather than as married-tax, so i'm in a position where I basically payed enough to warrant no further payment through the end of the year.

So, my question boils down to: is there any limit to the number of exemptions I select in my W4 or DE4 update?  Looks like I can update the W4 appropriately, but it will take a lot (&gt;&gt;20 exemptions) to get the DE 4 in order.  I basically need to adjust it for 0$ deductions.  Should I purposely claim excessive W4 exemptions to make up for the state-over-pay or will that get me into trouble?

Worst-case, I can handle the over payment until I can file my taxes next year, just wondering if there is a better option. I'll at-least update the fed-tax situation to improve my cash flow.

I am single with no husband or children and recently landed a job that pays 68k annually. However, health insurance is not included so I will have to use Obamacare through my state's exchange.  

The loans come from getting a PhD in psychology. I have no debt from undergrad. My program was unfunded. So, I had to take out the max each year in federal loans for tuition. Thankfully, my grad school stipend, side jobs, and side jobs helped cover living expenses.

The original total was 123k at 6.8%. I recently completed a postdoc where I was being paid 39-41k. I  paid it down in the last year and a half to 111k by being on IBR and paying above the minimum. I paid $500 every two weeks to reduce how much the interest accumulates each month (a tip I gained from PF!). I also contributed $200 monthly to a ROTH IRA to save something for retirement. I also took on an extra job during my postdoc to help put $500 in my savings each month for savings and taxes (my postdoc did not take fed or state taxes out of my check). I was also still receiving help from my parents, but not nearly as much as I was receiving during grad school.

As of right now, postdoc has ended and I received a job offer in DC with a salary of 68k. I want to up my Roth IRA and contribute $500 month to itA. My job has a SEP IRA, but the matching doesn't start until you're in the position for 1 year. So, I plan to keep contributing to my Roth (is this the smart thing to do?).

personalfinance,What to do with Savings Bonds,"My grandmother (deceased) had been buying all of her grandkids savings bonds and keeping them in a safety deposit box.

Here are my finances right now: 

* Paid off car that runs well 

* Home loan at 3.25% interest (100k left on mortgage) 

* Approx $40k in student loans (20k in repayment, 20k will be in repayment next year after wife graduates) about 5-6% interest rate

* Credit card with approx $2000 balance and 20% interest rate

My question is would it be better to cash these in now and pay off the high interest credit card debt since I am losing more than I am gaining in interest? Or should I stick these in the safe till they mature.

personalfinance,"Getting first apartment, would appreciate tips","My finance and I are getting our first apartment. We have already passed the credit and background checks. It's a subsidized apartment and we are both on Disability. It costs 30% of our monthly income, which is $947 dollars. It also pays for all utilities except phone, cable and internet. Our TV is old, so we're not going to get cable (at least now anyway) because we think it will break soon and we don't know when we can afford to get it replaced. We don't really watching it anyway and have Netflix through his mom. A landline and high speed internet will cost $58 a month (including tax) for the first year and $65 a month after that. My fiance subscribes to Gamefly for $18 a month. 

I'm estimating laundry (coin operated machines on site) will be around $50 a month. If for some reason there's an emergency, I can always do laundry at my Mom's. We have baskets and detergent too. Prescriptions for both of us are around $20-25 a month (it varies a little every month). I have a service dog, Barney, whose food and treats are about $50 a month (I try to get it on sale and coupon. One time I got it for $35). His flea medication is $15 a month. He also goes to the groomer once a month for his toenails and a sanitary trim for $20. It's more in the summer when he needs a shave down. I would do this myself, but I got t-boned at 55mph and am still having issues with my head (and he puts up a huge fight). He just had surgery and we will be making $50 payments on that for three months. Also because of my car accident, I cannot clip my own toenails (well, I can but it's EXTREMELY painful), so I get a pedi once a month for $25, though sometimes my SIL does it. I can't wash my hair either and get it done once a week at great clips for $5 plus a small tip. 

We get $400 in SNAP and our apartment building does a food bank twice a week. I have a crappy, but mostly reliable car and my Mom pays for the insurance, AAA, and maintenance if I can't afford it. We are looking into renter's insurance. I also know to go through the apartment with a fine tooth comb and take pictures of even the slightest damage and have the apartment manager sign off on it. It's a 2b/1b (first floor) with lots of closet space, though the kitchen is very small. No dishwasher. We toured it, though it hasn't be cleaned yet. They are installing brand new carpet. We are most likely moving in October 1st. 

However, the apartment complex is going under renovations in early 2016. They will pay for a hotel, a $52 a day food allowance (for 2 people) and to have our stuff moved in and out. This should take 30 days. The neighbors are extremely nice and almost everyone has dogs. It is an apartment specifically for the senior/disabled. It's behind a shopping center and in a nice, low crime area. 

We have a ton of matching kitchen stuff (I have been collecting Paula Deen kitchen ware for over 2 years). I have several pots and pans, two stock pots (12qt and 5qt), tons of bakeware, tons of utensils, a 32 piece dinnerware set, a 40 piece silverware set, a 40 piece tupper ware set, a drying rack for the dishes, a toaster, a coffee pot, a kitchen rug, a large kitchen garbage can and my Mom is getting us a nice microwave soon. We also have a shower curtain and hooks, bath mats, two pictures for the bathroom, a soap dish and tooth brush holder. We have a big linen closet that can be used for our towels and cleaning supplies. We still need a plunger and toilet scrubber. We have a very nice memory foam mattress, an older box spring that I wouldn't mind replacing, but we do need a new bed frame, so we'll have to start out with just the box spring and mattress on the floor. We only have one set of sheets and bedding. We have way too many pillows. 

We (probably) have a dining table that my aunt wants to get rid of and two nice chairs. They probably won't match, but that's what table clothes are for! The living/dining area isn't huge and I don't think we'll be able to fit more than a love seat and over-sized chair in it along with the dinning set. I have an ottoman, but nothing else to really sit on in the living room. Also, the bedrooms aren't big either, so I was thinking I'd hang our clothes in the closets and get a small (tall/slender) underwear and sock drawer. I have a couple mirrors for decoration, but would like to get some cheap artwork for the living and dining area. We have one computer desk.. And two computers. Don't know how that going to work. I may also be getting a small settlement from a knee injury that occurred early this year. It would be $2700 at most, but probably a lot less than that. I'm hoping I would at least get enough to buy some furniture. If you BUY at quality rentals, you can get furniture very cheap and they deliver it for free. I know not to rent from them though; the interest rate is like 2000%. I would appreciate any advice!

gaming,The good ol' days might not be as good as you remember them,"I hear a lot of people from my generation and before saying how gamers these days ""have it easy"" or are ""force fed"" - in that game's are too easy and the player all but has their nose shoved in front of where they need to go and what they need to do. In fact, I actually thought this way too - until recently.

After discovering my n64 emulator actually works with my XBOX controller I've gone on a bit of a retro splurge. Having just finished Ocarina of Time and moving onto Conker's Bad Fur Day I have come to this conclusion - game's still had a long way to go.

While I still think OOT is one of the greatest games ever designed (for its time) it still has a lot of glaring issues. Such as figuring out what the fuck to do. The hints you receive in the game are bare minimal to non-existent. If you get lost, tough shit buddy, figure it out for yourself. Don't worry though, we'll toss out a few vague hints that don't really help at all every now and then.

The main issue is difficulty. Game's really were too hard for the reward you received from them. Fun is much like a bell curve. When doing something new it is really fun - the experience is fresh and exciting. The longer you have that experience, and the more times you have to repeat it, the less fun it becomes. I think we can all agree on that. But games even as recent (however you define that) as the n64 didn't understand this. They all outstayed their welcome by making you do a task until the music, the graphics, the controls, everything further induced your monumental rage. You reach the point where you actually hate the task you're doing, you just want it to be over with ie. the game is no longer fun.

A perfect example of this is the hoverboard lava race in Conker's Bad Fur Day. At first I was thrilled I got to experience a race level. The new gameplay was exciting, the music was entertaining, and the level was simply fun. But then I died, again, and again, and again, and again. Till the music was grating, I hated the level, and just wanted it all to be over. This is bad game design.

Sure this can still happen with modern games, but it's a lot more controlled and a hell of a lot less blatant. Designers these days realise competition is so fierce they can't afford to have a player become so frustrated they're no longer enjoying the experience because guess what... they'll just move onto one they will.

My point is, while it may seem like games have drastically cut their severity of challenge - and they have - this is actually a good thing. While beating a challenge is rewarding and fun, repeatedly bashing your head against a wall - is not. Even when you finally beat the challenge you'll find yourself cursing the game for being such a pain in the ass instead of congratulating yourself for overcoming it.

It's just something to keep in mind next time you look down on the next generation of games and gamers. Games may be easier these days, but there also a hell of a lot more fun!",technology,1441615881
personalfinance,"Paid off my $10,000 in credit card debt- thank you!!","I just want to express my gratitude to everyone who contributes to this sub. With the sidebar and regular advice/wisdom I see here for others in similar situations as mine, I was able to create a plan for getting out of debt.

The first step was facing the shame head on and forgiving myself for taking missteps financially . I grew up in a family that knew little about planning financially and we regularly had utilities turned off. 

The first time I overdrafted my checking account I swore would be my last! With the great wealth of advice here I felt ready and capable of planning my future . Next I am getting an emergency fund saved, as well as planning a reward vacation in Belize ( don't worry, I charged it for the rewards but I have the cash to pay off the balance when the bill comes in). 

I can't thank you all enough for what you do. I think financial problems have caused my moms mental health issues to worsen, and I don't want that for me or my future children. I feel like I have the knowledge to prevent that now, and I am not afraid anymore! That's just the most amazing feeling of relief and hope I ever felt. :)


-----------
Edit: 
Alot of folks are asking for what my plan was. My plan was more or less to use Mint.com's pay off debt ""goal"" planning, really understand the benefits and risks of credit accounts, and, pay the smaller debts off first. I also took the advice here to re-assess your job/salary and expenses. I was able to negotiate a raise, as I was offered another job. I am a woman and I feel alot of women like myself (millenials who got screwed after graduation) are just grateful to be working, so, I didn't negotiate for myself for a long time and I was getting screwed. Once I got offered a better job that paid $20,000 more a year with another company, my boss told me ""what will it take you to stay""... Normally I would have just asked for a small raise, but this time I had nothing to lose so I asked him to match their offer. He said he would try to work out a system with bonuses but in the immediate, he gave me a $10,000 boost. I know not everyone is in that position but after reading here and realizing my worth, I made a huge difference in my financial life (thank you!) (And yes, we are still negotiating the bonuses - I am actually thinking instead of bonuses I should just ask for a 401k for that money to go into, we dont have an established program here at my small company).

Here is what happened:

-6 years ago got out of college.... had so little money, and shitty low paying jobs (because of the economy tanking)
-My debt slowly creeped up for little things here and there (ie emergencies, groceries, impulse buys). I had a revolving debt of like $2,000
-2011 I moved into my current apartment, and used my credit card to help pay for the deposit of $1,300 (STUPID! NEVER TAKE CASH FROM A CARD)
-So now I'm at a revolving debt of like $4,000
-2012 my dad died, more spending to get myself to his funeral, now I'm at like $5,000
-2013- Cat has major accident, surgery, I'm at like $8,000
-Early 2014 I decided I really needed to get my shit together, because I got up to about $10,000
-2014 - All my tax returns paid to my debt (I think like $2,000)
-2014 I waxed and waned. It was really hard sticking to my budget and I was sometimes only paying interest....My SO was in and out of shitty jobs so we were not always making ends meet. I did pay off smaller stuff this year, total about $400 per month
-2015 January - I negotiated a raise of $10,000 (because I was being so underpaid for a big city). 
-2015 April Tax Return - All paid to my Credit Cards - now I'm down to $5,000 April 2015
-I paid like $400 per month to my credit cards, cashed in the ""points"" to pay some of the debt off.
-Just a few days ago I got a settlement from an injury that paid off the balance.... A few thousand. 
-There was money left over so $1,000 stays in savings and I already had $300 in savings, the rest I used toward this frugal trip I am taking for Christmas. From there its straight back to my savings account.  I am paying student loans as well, but, I am paying over the minimum, and, they are all federal loans that are 6.5% or below. I decided its way better to get my EF established for a year, because I live in San Francisco and I do fear eviction, or economy tanking to the extent that the EF is way more of a priority.

I have to say, that, there were road blocks, this was not a ""I woke up and decided to change and was perfect the whole time"" story - I did fuck up BUT I never gave up.

So anyone who feels like they aren't being ""perfect"" with their plan and payments.... don't beat yourself up and ignore the criticism if you know you are not going to give up and that you are committed to being a fiscally responsible person with a positive future. You are human. Things happen. You deserve happiness. Just keep yourself committed. Also, the support of my significant other really helped. When he was open to eating at home with me and going out to eat less, cancelling our gym membership for 6 months, etc, it was alot easier on me because I wasn't missing out or trying to keep up with him. 

More advice... I used Mint.com for the first couple of years but then once some of the higher interest debts were paid off, I knew what I needed to do and I kept myself subscribed here to remind me as I was browsing reddit that I am now a more educated spender/saver and not to get sidetracked. I found it way easier to pay off the smaller cards first, then I only had to concentrate on the main 2 I had. That worked for me and the positive reinforcement of having some of the accounts at $0 really helped me through harder times.",finance,1441618824
personalfinance,[UK] Debt Consolidation - Any help greatly appreciated,"Hi guys - so I've seen this sub floating around for a while on Reddit, but I've always felt too embarrassed to head on over and start my own post.

So - I'm 27 and the last decade has been a blur.  Not learning how to budget, living an unsustainable lifestyle and generally not being in a good place.  It's time to put a stop to this, to grow up and learn from my mistakes.

So, I'm self employed, and only recently have I started to take things seriously.  Income had been low, hence the borrowing, and the initial 0% interest rates lured me in.  The money has literally been wasted - filling a void in my life.

Income ~ £1500-2000 pcm after taxes, student loan repayments &amp; business expenses. This will increase as I up my game, but this is the figure I will work off of for now.  My work can be volatile in terms of monthly income bouncing up and down (more a management problem my end which I am improving on)

Credit Card 1 - £9000 @ 17.5% APR (£245 min payment) [3 year pay off = £327 pcm)
Credit Card 2 - £5250 @ 16.62% APR (min payment £140) [3 year pay off = £186 pcm)
Credit Card 3 - £950 @ 17.50% APR (min payment £40 - paid off in ~3 years)
Student Overdraft - £2000 @ 18.28% APR 


Total Monthly Repayments are currentl @ £700 pcm

My life expenses (essentials - rent, food, travel etc) are ~ £500-£600 pcm.

Here's a little more info:

- I've completed my first budget and I am writing down everything I spend.  The front page of my spreadsheet shows a figure as to how much money I have left for the month.

- My credit score is 814 or 'fair'.  Things keeping my score down are:
1) Total non-revolving credit card balance has not reduced significantly.
2) The usage of your available credit indicates a higher risk

- My business is being taken seriously.  The push this year will be to have a take home pay of £3000 in the next 12 months (very do-able).

- I'm 27 now.  I'm still living at home with the parents.  I want this sorted in 3 years.  Work NEEDS to increase (this is the push I've needed) and I NEED to manage my finances to a tee.  

- I've looked into options of loans/credit cards transfers for debt consolidation.  The options aren't looking great (I stupidly applied for one before checking my credit score).  The best option is looking like a 2.5% transfer fee with 36months @ 0% APR with a 50% chance of being approved.

- If I could consolidate the debt in someway to get these monthly repayments down and start eating into these large figures I would be over the moon.  It would take a massive pressure from my life that has been keeping me down and give me that room in my head to push on in other ares.

- I have other payments that I am currently covering.  Monthly tax repayments (again complete immaturity and mismanagement), and paying off some damage which I caused recently which wasn't covered by insurance.

I'm here to learn, work hard and get this mess sorted.  I know I've been living in a ridiculous way - it's as if something went 'pop' recently and my head poked out of the clouds with a clear perspective on where I have been, where I am and where I want to get to.

personalfinance,"Sold my London apartment, have £200k+ in bank - concerned about losing it all. (UK)","I sold my home in a relatively 'up and coming' part of London, UK (read hyper gentrified and a real tension caused by a juxtaposition of rich, pushing out the poor and living in such close proximity). It was a very small 1b, very noisy flat, and it went for over £1k per sq ft. Property prices here have gone entirely nuts.

I felt that the property market was at or near the top and that the global state of things meant it was more likely to change sooner rather than later. Its my view that the debt driven economic 'recovery' is on a knife edge and its quite feasible that there is another implosion a la 2008. 

Therefore it made sense to me to get out and wait.

I was part of the problem in London and over a period of years decided that I wanted to make some broader changes so also quit the job and went away travelling for a few months with my family. I've just got back, ready to start a new life with wife and kids somewhere far removed from the big city and all the nasty, neoliberal focused nonsense it now seems to represent, but am concerned that my equity is going to disappear if there is another implosion. 

I'm keeping a tab on Chinese stocks, the Fed, interest rates, Syria, Greece, ECB, Spain, EM economics, the massive volume of global sovereign debt etc, etc and I'm concerned that something is around the corner that will mean what I have to buy a home will disappear overnight.

I'm trying to work out the best way to protect it. I'm not looking to 'play' the markets and try and turn it into more money, just ensure its safe and that I still have something to buy a home with when the market corrects (which to me, feels inevitable). Sitting it in a couple of current accounts isn't a very robust plan - even with FSCS.

I've considered gold, other metals, just using it to get another house now (but with a huge mortgage given the house prices here), however all of these feel subject to potential manipulation or exposing myself to even more risk - especially if I see some substantial economic problems are around the corner.

I'm not really ruling anything out. I'm more savvy than Joe public I think, but by no means do I know enough about financial products to know what is best to do.

personalfinance,"(UK) My Fixed Rate Mortgage is coming to an end, they've emailed me with options but I'm confused (figures inside)","Hi everyone.

When we bought our house we had a 2 year fixed rate mortgage which is coming to an end in October. Our provider have sent us a leaflet with some options for going back on to another Fixed Rate mortgage but I'm a bit confused as to what the ramifications are.

Our current mortgage rate is 3.39% and they have offered the following:

2 years 1.64% (with a fee of 999) or 2.14%
3 years 2.09% (with a fee of 999) or 2.39%
5 years 2.54% (with a fee of 999) or 2.64%
10 years 3.14% (with fee of 999) or 3.24%

My main point of confusion is that all of these rates are smaller than our current 3.39%, so does that mean our monthly cost will be smaller with a new fixed rate?

I don't really understand interest rates as they are managed by the BoE but everyone always seems surprised when they don't move. This leads me to believe that a fixed rate is a sensible idea and 3 years at 2.39% seems like a good compromise.

Brief breakdown of situation:  Married into student loan debt of $65k (currently down to $55k).  We have roughly $10k in credit card debt and a little less than $10k loan for a home improvement project.  

Option 1:  Pay off $10k loan for home improvement loan and throw what's left of the $1k at the credit cards.  Upon paying off the home improvement loan-- I'm freeing up $300/mo or as I like to call it ""..just gave myself a $300/mo raise""

Option 2:  Pay off both credit cards and forget the raise (for now).  Then pay off the home improvement loan over the next 3-4 months.  

My lean is to pay off the improvement loan to free up more cash to pay off the CC's and then getting aggressive with the student loans.  The interest rate on the CC's is low enough that I'll probably end up paying $100 in interest a month.

personalfinance,State Financial Aid hasn't gone back to me in over two months...,"So my brother and I decided to apply for the FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, for my first year. I finished the application by the end of January because the schools I applied to wanted it. We used 2013 Tax Returns instead.

March arrives and... holy shit. We went from an EFC of over 6,000 to an EFC of 0. We get the full Pell Grant from our respective universities, who are willing to give it to us. My school gave it to us without hesitation, while my brother's school did ask for some verification. The verification went through and he was approved for a full Pell Grant.

On the other hand, we are dealing with our state's financial aid organization: HESAA (New Jersey's Higher Education Student Assistance Authority). We had to resend our 2014 documents because they only use the first FAFSA we send for each school year.

After sending the correct information to the state twice, we sat there and waited. One week became two... later four. Over two months later and I still have not received any information from the state. All I have been told is that they have received my information.

We were also told that my brother needs to send the same documents, but with back and forth 'yes' and 'no' we are stuck in this huge limbo. Now, my brother and I had to fork out some money because our scholarships and financial aid was not enough to cover everything. We are still in need of some aid, and HESAA's NJ TAG will give us the money we need. The only issue is that, with calls not working, what can I do to get them to give me a new estimate for my grant?",finance,1441650208
personalfinance,Need Help with Current Situation. Unemployed lawyer with massive debt.,"Hi,
I graduated from law school two years ago, and decided I have no interest in practicing law. I decided in law school to also get an MBA (we didn't learn anything about personal finance).  I just quit practicing full time, and have found a non-law job starting in a month where I will gross about $4200 a month, living rent free.  I have racked up a bit of debt in getting to where I am now:

$180,000 in Federal Student Loans @ 6.8%, which is actually the least of my concern; it is capped at 10% of my ""disposable income"" (AGI-150% of the poverty line), and currently my payments are at $0 until next tax season. This loan will be forgiven in 19 years. Alternatively, if I find a public service job (non-profit, teaching, government, etc), the debt will be discharged in 10 years.

The debt I am most concerned with is as follows:

$15k CC debt @ 15.5% APR
$7k private student loan at 6%
$12.5k private student loan at 5.5%

My assets are limited:
Paid off vehicle worth $8000
Motorcycle (I rarely use but has sentimental value) worth $2400
Boat worth $6k-7k

I don't really want to sell the boat, but will if I have to.  I foresee maintaining a job that will net ~$38k after tax the next 5 years.

Can anyone please provide some advice or ideas on the best way to address this debt?  I have thought about taking a loan out on my car at 3% to put down a portion of the CC debt. I like this approach as it would not tempt me to pay the minimum on my credit cards as I am currently doing. Any other strategies would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.",finance,1441650262

I'm sorry if this has been addressed before but I have what seems to be a unique problem.

A few facts:

- I am 21 y/o

- I have about 23k in savings

- I have about 24k in (Federal, Stratford, Unsub and sub) Student Loans, in my senior year but I got grants and scholarships to cover everything this year, so that should only increase with some interest. (note: I haven't made any payments on this ever)

- I have a part time job that pays good and am lined up to work there after I graduate (Spring 2016) where I will make an actual salary (somewhere from 45-50k)

- I am looking at Honda Fits for my used car, I can get a used one with about 80,000mi on it in my price range

Ok! So I am in the market to buy my first car. And I need to know the best way to go about that. a few ideas I have:

1. Buy a used car for &lt;10k, put 8k/9k towards Student Loans leaving me with a savings of about 5k just in case

OR...

2. ""transfer"" student loans into a car loan by paying off most of my student loans, leaving myself with a smaller saving but something just in case, and then buying a new Fit for 17k-ish (finance it)

OR...

???

I hope someone can help me because I am not used to dealing with this much money, I liked saving it all up but it's hard for me to convince myself to actually spend it, I try to stay very frugal. Let me know if you have any questions please!! :)",finance,1441651117
personalfinance,What should I do to prep financially for Graduate School?,"I am currently a junior in my undergraduate program. I work a part time job and until recently so did my wife. Up until this semester neither of us have had to take out any student loans. My wife recently decided to quit her job to focus on school so we are at less than half income. We both took out about 5k of student loans each this year and should be able to live off of my part time income and loans. Next year we may be able to make it without student loans but worst case scenario we both graduate college with about 20k in student loans combined. I'm not worried about this too much. 

   What I am worried about is the prospect of graduate school. I've studied most school with the masters degree I'm looking for, (MA in Translation and Localization Management) and I've  realized that there are only 2 good schools in the US that offer similar programs and about 3 or 4 in the UK. I won't go much into the UK options but to say that they would probably cost around 15k a semester plus living costs. So there are two schools in the US I'm considering. One is Kent State Ohio and the Other is Middlebury Institute of International Studies (in Monterey California). Education wise they are both excellent. But Middlebury focuses and excels in my exact program, they have amazing graduation and job placement rates, and their graduates are heavily recruited by both the federal government and Private companies, so obviously I want to go there over Kent State. 

   The question is, what should I do to prepare financially for the insane amounts of debt I'm going to take on during graduate school. Kent state tuition is approximately $9,000 a semester plus living costs, I'm estimating about $80k in student loans upon gradation. MIIS runs much more at about $19,000 a semester plus living costs, I will probably take on about $150k worth of student loans for the two years I am there. How do I prepare for that, and/or is it even possible to prepare yourself for that much debt?

personalfinance,Should I go bankrupt?,"I am in my mid-40s with almost no material possessions.

personalfinance,How to fix my credit resulting from premature payments,"Hi so I think I put this in the right section. 
I recently graduated college in December 2014 and I was going to start making payments back on my student loans and noticed that I had multiple failed payments (about 9) since I started attending college in 2010. 

I was in school the entire time so I thought that the payments wouldn't start until my 6 month grace period was over after graduating. I talked with a fed loan customer rep but they weren't too much help and we decided to bring my account to current so that I could start making affordable payments every month. 

My question is how can I fix my credit report so that those failed payments (which should have never posted to my account) do not negatively affect my credit score?",finance,1441657263
personalfinance,Should I use the financial aid disbursement money I will be getting to pay off past Federal Student loans?,"My education and financial background is a bit long and weird so I'll give a summarized version with relevant information.

**Fall 2012 - Jan. 2013:**

17 years old, went to UC Davis on ""full financial aid"" from August 2012 through Jan. 2013 (left for various reasons). Only had to pay back about 2k in federal loans I believe.

**2013 - Fall 2013**

Mostly stayed at home playing online games out of depression.

**Fall 2013 - Jan. 2014**

Attended American International University (AIU, a private, for-profit, online college). One of the worst decisions I made out of desperation of thinking I needed to get a college education and thought it would be convenient because it was online. Not really paying attention to the cost. Left when I realized that it pretty much was a scam (some credits won't transfer to other Unis, high costs, etc).

Only owed about $3k in loans.

**Side note:** There were some smaller non-loan, direct cost payments for both UC Davis and AIU that have been payed off (thanks to my mom).

**Jan. 2014 - Summer 2014**

Mostly stayed at home again playing online games out of depression and not knowing what to do with my life.

**Fall 2014 - Summer 2015**

Again spent time playing games, but entered a huge growth and maturity period where I learned a lot about the real world (thanks Reddit, and I don't mead frontpage, I'm talking about subreddits that give loads of important and relevant information about specific subjects like Personal Finance) about different careers and opportunities. Jumped from wanting to join Air Force, become a auto-technician, to now wanting to be an electrician or electrical engineer.

Also, my mom has been paying off my Federal student loans in monthly $50.00 payments.

**Summer 2015**

Spent a lot of time trying to get a job (still haven't got one unfortunately), passed an electrical apprenticeship examine but currently still waiting for interview date, and got enrolled to attend local community college with full financial aid to get myself going again in the meantime.

**Current situation**

20 years old, never had a job, currently attending 3 classes (12 units) at local CC, still living with family (we're from a lower class background). Mom makes about $21k a year still supports me and my 22 year old brother (thats a whole different story), but we live with her sister and brother-in-law (she makes about $45k but is about to retire, and her husband has retired and lives off social security). Unsure what he gets, but we all live an okay life and get by barely.

From what I understand, I'll be getting a financial aid check due to Pell Grant in a few weeks for about $1.9k on the first disbursement and another $1.9k on the second disbursement later this year (books have been taken care of so no worries about that). 

I wanted to use the disbursement to pay for repairs on my car (its an old car -226,000 miles- that was giving to me by my dad about a year ago, -parents have been separated since I was 10 and never married-). However, I also wanted to save up some of the money to celebrate my 21st birthday coming up in a few months (go karting with my friends, then celebrate over the weekend in vegas, it won't be as expensive as my friends (who are essentially family) can get me a hotel like we usually do, and the club we want to go to his brother works there so he can get us in as he did for our other friend on his 21st).

I don't go out much, so I wanted to use it to actually do something since I rarely go out with my friends (other than at out, skype and play games, we all live in SoCal, friends since highschool). 

**Actual Question and TL;DR**

So between now Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 Semester, I should be getting a total of about less than $7.5k in financial aid disbursement over 4 checks (so about $1.9k each). I wanted to use the first and part of the second check for myself and to pay for car repairs (about less than $3k). Then I want to save up the rest to pay off the Federal Student loan I owe (about $4.4k in total). 

Is this advisable? Can I even use the disbursement money from financial aid to pay off the Student Federal Loans I currently owe without unintended consequences?

Also, will getting a part-time job affect my financial aid for this year?

Thanks in advance for all the help and advice you can guys give!",finance,1441658270
Forex,RBNZ this thursday,"It's that time again for NZ.

OIS markets have priced in a 91% chance of a 25bp cut, so that's pretty much a done deal, with the next meeting pricing in a 39% chance (sep-oct spread)

Unlike last time, as far as interest rate markets go, we're starting to see a bit more of a two-way market, rather than the one way rush we had coming into the last meeting.  Positioning will be less extreme, but the focus on the statement will be in focus again.  It's a MPS this time (Monetary policy statement), so there will be much more to look at as far as the RBNZ's forecasts go, which should give us good insight as to what scenario they are currently looking at.

The RBNZ will obviously be concerned about the developments in China, which has flared up considerably since the last meeting.  On the flipside the past 2 dairy auctions have been strong, but whether this is simply a correction rather than a turn in trend is yet to be seen.  I'd be hard pushed to call for higher dairy prices longer term with whats going on in China, one of the largest buyers of NZ milk powder, and even just a stabilization in prices is still going to keep the pressure on farmers.  The NZD has also kept falling, albeit in a more orderly fashion, and the lower kiwi will eventually start to stoke inflation pressures.  More LVR restrictions in the auckland market are coming into effect in november (this was slated to happen in Oct, but was delayed to allow banks to prepare) just to add into the mix.

We could see a change from ""further easing is likely"" to ""further easing may be appropriate"" as we are approaching the point where further cuts are no longer a done deal like they have been so far this year.  The risk is here than if it becomes apparent that we may be reaching a pause, a correction in NZD could have some legs to run.  

I'm running pretty light into the RBNZ, and will be reassessing after digesting the statement.   Would be interested to hear any thoughts on it.",finance,1441670648
financialindependence,My rental property is holding me back from maxing out my 401(k) and IRA. Should I sell it?,"I turned my first house into a rental property over a year and a half ago.  The house has a 3.25% interest rate with $69,000 left on the mortgage.  I have about $70,000 worth of equity in the house (worth about $140,000).  The house rents out for $1300 a month and has a mortgage payment of $950.  It will be paid off in about 9 years.  After expenses, I have about $3,500 in positive cash flow every year in addition building $7,000 in equity.
I am pretty happy with this deal.  However, due to a good portion of my net worth being in real estate, I am unable to max out both my 401(k) and my IRA.  If I were to sell my house, I would be able to max out both accounts.  Should I sell my rental property to max out the tax advantaged accounts available to me?  I have been wrestling with this question for a while now and would love your input.

My parents have been pushing this hard as a way to make some passive income every month - according to them it'll basically be free money every month with pretty much no work on my end once I find a capable property management company.

Here are my financials:

* California; 21/M/720 credit score
* Income: $127,000 gross annual; ~$6000 monthly after taxes and a max 401k deduction
* Expenses: ~$2000/mo.

    * Entertainment (streaming): $40
    * Server/webhosting: $25
* Cash: $100,000 in a high-yield savings account
* Loans/debt: None

1. Can I afford the monthly mortgage payments on a $150k-300k property? I'd be putting 20% down at least, but I'm worried about the fact that my credit history only goes back about 4 years and the implications that will have on my interest rate.
2. Is it even a good idea in the first place to buy a rental property right now? My main concern is what would happen if I couldn't find any tenants - I highly doubt I could afford to pay rent and a mortgage at the same time, and if I put 20% down on a property I wouldn't have a very long runway before I run out of cash. How likely is it that I'll be at a net gain from rental income after property taxes, upkeep, and mortgage payments? Is it really as simple as hiring a property management company and getting free money every month?

worldpolitics,"G20 Summit: No Plan, No Ideas - Politically Bankrupt","7 September 2015

The meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers held in Ankara, Turkey over the weekend underscored the inability of the major capitalist powers to initiate any measures to halt the recessionary forces overtaking the world economy. Rather than a proposal for concerted action, the official communique was a public relations exercise aimed at masking the acuteness of the crisis and the impotence of the economic and financial authorities.

The meeting was held in the midst of turbulence on global financial markets fuelled by growing fears that the efforts of central banks to prop up the economy with injections of money are being swamped by deflationary trends.

Despite an admission that “global growth falls short of our expectations” and warnings of the impact of financial turmoil and slowing growth in China on emerging markets and more broadly, the communique declared that the G20 had taken “decisive action to keep the recovery on track” and was “confident the global economic recovery will gain speed.”

There is, in fact, no global economic recovery. In a note published in preparation for the G20 meeting, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) acknowledged that its forecasts for the world economy, made only last July, were already out of date. Growth had fallen below predictions in the US, the euro zone, Japan and most poorer countries.

The predicted boost from lower oil prices had failed to materialise, the IMF acknowledged, risks to the world economy had risen, and “a simultaneous materialisation of some of these risks would imply a much weaker outlook.” The IMF is expected to again revise downward its forecasts for global growth, already at their lowest level since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008–2009, at its next meeting scheduled for October. “After six years of demand weakness, the likelihood of damage to potential output is increasingly a concern,” it said.

Another indication of the real state of the global economy is the data on world trade released last month, showing that trade contracted in the first half of 2015 more sharply than at any time since the height of the financial crisis in early 2009.

A pointed comment published on the CNBC web site on the eve of the G20 meeting predicted that whatever came out of the gathering, global leaders would “undoubtedly try to give the impression they have a plan, no matter how far-fetched it is, because if the world markets get a sniff that there is no plan, that things are being made up on the hoof and that things are slipping out of control,” there will be increased turbulence.

This was an apt preview of the communique that emerged from the meeting.

As a result of the financial turbulence in China and mounting concerns over its growth rate—with expectations that real growth will be closer to 4 percent than the official target of 7 percent—there was undoubtedly discussion of the state of the world’s second largest economy behind the scenes.

But the comments from financial officials sought to promote an upbeat message. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble said the G20 had agreed there was no reason to fear slower Chinese growth, while Pierre Moscovici, the European Union commissioner for economic affairs, praised “the absolute determination of the [Chinese] authorities to sustain growth.” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said there had been a very open dialogue with China and it was “extremely comforting to have that level of understanding.”

However, the underlying reality broke through the façade of contrived statements on one decisive question, revealing growing divergences among the major powers. The official line of the meeting was to accept the Chinese explanation that last month’s currency devaluation was not aimed at bolstering Beijing’s export position at the expense of its rivals, but was a move towards a market-based currency. The communique included a hollow pledge that members would “refrain from competitive devaluation” and “avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments,” even as it is acknowledged that such commitments are being honoured mostly in the breach.

But in a pointed departure from normal procedure at such meetings, Japan, which stands to lose heavily as a result of a major fall in the Chinese currency, did not adhere to the official line. Speaking to reporters, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said Chinese representatives had given an incomplete explanation of their motives. “They may have tried to be constructive, but they weren’t detailed enough,” he said.

Another area of divergence, which was also largely covered over, was on the issue of monetary policy. The United States is officially committed to an increase in its official interest rate, even if only a very small one, in the coming period. But the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are both committed to continuing the policy of quantitative easing, with ECB President Mario Draghi indicating on the eve of the meeting that he might extend the present asset-purchasing operation beyond the scheduled completion date of September 2016.

The IMF has urged the US Federal Reserve not to begin interest rate increases until well into next year, a position that was repeated by Managing Director Lagarde. The Fed had not raised interest rates for such a long time (nine years), that it should make a move only when there was no uncertainty and should not give it a try and then have to reverse its decision, she said.

Lagarde and others fear that any interest rate increase in the US will impact heavily on the financial position of emerging markets and spark a major outflow of capital, exceeding that which took place during the so-called “taper tantrum” of 2013, when the Fed first indicated it would wind back its asset-purchasing program.

Emerging markets are already feeling the effects of the slowdown in China, their major export market, with currency values in some South East Asian countries down to levels not seen since the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98. If a rise in US interest rates sparks a rush for the exit by major investors, it could set off a major financial crisis.

According to Troy Gayseki, a senior portfolio manager as Skybridge, a firm that specialises in hedge fund investing, several emerging market hedge fund managers suffered losses of between 3 and 35 percent in August. “There is a lot of chaos and carnage out there,” he told the Financial Times.

In all of the reports by economic authorities on the state of the world economy, including the IMF and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the lack of investment, now 25 percent below where it was in 2007 in some cases, is cited as the major cause of economic stagnation. There was an attempt to address this issue at the G20 heads of government meeting in Brisbane, Australia last November, at which participants committed themselves to the target of a two percent increase in growth over the next five years, much of it to be achieved through infrastructure projects. Less than a year on, the goals of the Brisbane meeting are regarded as a dead letter.

This decline in productive investment is a product of the colossal growth of financial speculation and parasitism in the world capitalist economy, with resources increasingly diverted away from investment in the material productive forces and into financial manipulations and swindles that account for an ever greater share of the income of the world’s billionaires. The policy of central banks and capitalist governments of continuing to pump vast sums into the financial markets only fuels the growth of financial parasitism.

Seven years after the Wall Street crash of September 2008, the inability of the major capitalist powers and their economic and financial authorities to devise any coordinated solution to the crisis is the expression not of some intellectual incapacity, but of something much more fundamental.

I've managed to reign it in, but I'm still paying off some debt, and don't have any savings to access for a used vehicle.

It seems that making payments on a used vehicle typically involves higher interest rates, and therefore higher payments. I originally had planned on buying this vehicle at the end of the lease, however, a couple poor decisions in the past 2 years have made that unrealistic.

Am I wrong in planning to lease one more time, and actually follow through with the purchase at the end of this term? Leasing would keep the payments low, allowing me to get back on top of my money issues, and it keeps me free of any major vehicle expenses, while I build up some savings.

personalfinance,Questions about Student Loan Debt repayment,"Here's my situation PF, I am 24 and graduated May 2014 with about 35k in student loan debt. All of that is Navient loans ranging from 2k-5k and interest rates from 2.5-6.5%. 

I know from being a member of this sub for a while that 6.5% is starting to push into the 'unacceptable' territory. However, my minimum monthly payment is only $192. (After my 401k and taxes I bring home about $2,300/mo). Should I be concerned with paying these off any faster than the monthly minimum?

I have half a bonus I received a few weeks ago and I want to make the best decision with it. My knee jerk reaction was to put it towards one of the 6.5% loans but the more I think about that monthly payment, the less I'm convinced that makes sense. 

**tl;dr: At $192/mo is it worth me trying to pay down my student loans with windfalls?**

When viewing it as a table by month, what I extract is this: the mean values are not useful as they tend to be biased by spikes, but median values show that consistently since 1990, and with no variation except in the past five years, the median value of the S&amp;P500 has been 20, not 15.  

Since 2010 however, the median value has been about 17, only recently passing 20, then falling below it in the past month.  

A lot of guidance as to how 'overbought' the market is has centered on the idea that historical data matters, but since the late 80s we have diverged markedly from historical trends.  

While I've been bearish as fuck this year based on the ending of artificial market buoying of the fed, I am inclined to think that we never really overinflated stocks all *that* much.

personalfinance,"Are you on income-driven student loan payments and on track for Public Service Loan Forgiveness? Contribute lots more to your 401k, and have lots of kids. Every dollar of extra income you receive is effectively double-taxed. Every extra kid you have lowers your monthly payment.","I used to think that Roth IRAs were the holy grail of retirement savings for people early in their careers, but I've changed my mind for situations where you are on income-based repayments and working towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

**By the way, this post is only geared towards people who are in Public Service jobs and know you will be in this career for the whole 10 years needed for loan forgiveness. If you are not in public service, this information could actually backfire on you, so please be careful.**

First, let's cover some definitions. 

Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is the income that you report at the bottom of your [1040](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf) and 1040A tax form which is calculated by your gross income minus above-the-line deductions. If you are paid $40,000 gross, and you contribute 5% to your 401k, that lowers your income to $38,000. In addition, if you take other above-the-line deductions such as contributing to a Traditional IRA, let's say $5500, that lowers your AGI to $32500. The AGI is the most important number on your tax form, because it determines your eligibility in all sorts of tax benefits. For example, your eligibility to contribute to a Roth IRA is determined in part by your AGI.

Income-driven repayments comes in several flavors, such as Income-Based Repayments (IBR) and Pay As You Earn (PAYE). The way these repayment plans determine your monthly payment is be taking your AGI and taking 10-15% of your discretionary income after 150% of the poverty line. So if you are single, and have an AGI of $45,000, and are on the IBR plan, your payment would be 15% of $27,495, or $343.68/mo. You can lower this payment by lowering your AGI. I don't want you to take a voluntary pay cut, but instead, you can increase your retirement contributions. If you make a $5500 Traditional IRA contribution, this lowers your AGI to $39,500 which makes your payment $274.93/mo. So not only did you save extra money for retirement, but your student loan payment got cut by $68/mo! That'll easily pay for your Comcast data overages!

Another way to think about this is that every extra dollar of income you receive is not only taxed at your federal and state income tax marginal rates (15%,25% etc) but is also ""taxed"" at 15% by your IBR student loan payment plan! So keeping your compensation low through increased retirement savings can have a double tax advantage!

Let's talk about the poverty line income, family size and how this also lowers your payments. [This website](http://www.liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/profiles/povertytables/FY2015/popstate.htm) has a useful table which outlines exactly what 150% poverty line income is for families of 1 through 5. Let's revisit that $45k earning single person. If that person has a child or gets married, and the family number goes up to 2, the payment has gone down to $267.56. If you add another family member, the payment has gone down to $191.43. So basically, by going from 1 to 3 family members, you pay $1,827 less in loans in a year.

About marriage: don't forget that Income Based Repayments and PAYE both look at your combined family income if you are married filing jointly. If you have six figures of loans and also make less money than your spouse, you might be better off filing married separate, which may lower your student loan bill by thousands of dollars per year. But you lose out on some tax benefits, so be careful about this.

**TL;DR - Working in a public service career, have lots of student loans, and want to pay as little student loans as possible? Take as many above-the-line deductions as you can to lower your AGI, boost your retirement and health account savings, oh, and have lots of kids ;-)**",finance,1441736110

personalfinance,Buying a share of a building,"Apologies for the long post, but I guess I'm just thorough.

My wife and I have lived in the same apartment for 3 years in San Francisco.  The building is owned by family friends and they have given us a good price on the rent (for SF anyway).  The location is perfect for my wife and I and it is a great building and it somewhere we have interest living long term.

The family that owns the building has had some tough situations they've had to navigate these last few years, almost depleting their cash reserves.  They had to buy out a mistress who snagged 1/3 ownership of the building when the original owner suddenly died without a will.  They repainted and re-roofed the building.  And now the SF seismic retrofit mandate is looming with an estimated cost of 100k.

The above has put the building/family in a situation where they have 2 options.  Either sell the building or borrow more money against the house to pay for the seismic retrofit.

When the family shared this situation with me, the idea of buying a share of the building popped into my head.  This would give the cash influx the family needs to pay for the retrofit without having to go further into debt and I think it would be a decent long term investment for me (I think)

Here are the specs on the building:

Assessed Value: 3M

6 unit building

Current rental income: ~11k/month

Elevation: 200 ft (global warming and Tsunami proof)

Survived 1906 and 1989 without any issues.

My thought was to buy a 10-20% share of the building, which my wife and I could easily afford mortgage-wise.

* Two private loans totaling $50,000 that I pay $250 a month

I recently applied for a Chase Slate card because I wanted to transfer some of the balance from my current credit card to it. The Chase Slate card had 0% fee for balance transfers and a 0% APR for the first year. Today, I received a notice that stated I was denied the card due to :
* High debt relative to income
* Length of time since oldest credit card was opened is too short
* Total available credit on credit cards is too low
* Too many accounts with a high balance compared to the credit line.

It also told me I have a 613 credit score. With my current credit card, like I said, I pay about $90 a month. Then, interest charges are usually around $60 a month. So I end up paying around $30 towards paying down what I owe for my credit card.

I graduated last year from a public university, for which I paid out of state tuition for three years (I attending a private university my first year, most of that was covered by scholarships, it's a shame I hated it there). Life choices aside, I need some help with loan consolidation. I graduated with about 60k in debt, approximately 17K of that being in private loans- 10.5K@9.25% and 6.5K@7.25%. I am making these payments and even paying over what I owe. I have applied to consolidate this debt with DRB and SoFi in the past, but was rejected (presumably because I was making substantially less money, and at this point I am not attempting to do anything with the federal debt because I am comfortable with my current income contingent payment plan). Fast forward to a couple months later, I have no other debt besides leasing my car, and I make about 48K a year with my new job and I have good credit. However, I keep getting ""rejected"" in the pre-screening process- I can only guess because I owe so much in student debt that my debt to income ratio is bad? I feel trapped because although all my bills are paid, and I'm hyped about that, the system is making it really hard for me to get ahead. Realistically I fully intend on paying the same amount towards these loans each month, I just really want to feel like I'm actually making a dent by lowering the interest.

personalfinance,YSK that you can save thousand of dollars in PMI if you are a Native American.,"I learned recently when buying my last home that HUD carries a special loan program for Native Americans called the HUD-184 program. Details are as follows. 

There are many advantages to using a Section 184:

• Low Down Payment: 2.25% on loans over $50,000 and only 1.25% on loans under $50,000

• Low Interest Rates: based on market rates, not on applicant’s Credit Scores

• Manual Underwriting: The Program utilizes a hands-on approach to underwriting and approval opposed to automated decision-making tools.

• Growing National Network of Approved Lenders: Our network of approved lenders includes national companies and local banks to suit your needs. Our Lenders have also been trained on the unique circumstances of Native homeownership.

• Section 184 Upfront Loan Guarantee Fee and Annual Mortgage Insurance:  A one-time 1.5% up front guarantee fee is paid at closing and can be financed into the loan.  In addition, loans with a loan to value of 78% or greater will be subject to an annual .15% mortgage insurance premium.

• Protection from predatory lending: Our Program monitors the fees our approved lenders can charge Native borrowers. Section 184 loans cannot be used for Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs).

• Knowledgeable Staff: Our staff understands the unique circumstances associated with lending on Native Lands and we work with borrowers to achieve home ownership and to avoid default and foreclosure.

This rate expires in December, though the credit card provider has told me that if I pay it off in full before then, there's another 0.99% balance transfer option they can apply.  Total credit limit on this card is currently $5,300.

Other financial instruments:

* I have another credit card with no balance currently.  I use it to make purchases but pay it off fully at the end of the month.  It is a 15% annual ""low"" interest rate card. 

* I also have $2K in overdraft protection for my personal bank account, which I have only used twice in the last two or three years.

Thinking about school:

I've never applied for student loans so I don't know how much I qualify for.  I'm also not sure what I'm allowed to used the loans for, or how they work.  I have some questions:

* Are student loans provided directly to your school, or can you access the loan as if it was a line of credit?
* Does a student loan give you a set amount per year, or could you access a lump sum up front?
* What happens to my debt when I apply for a student loan? Can I pay off the debts up-front with some student loan money, or do I keep servicing the debts by paying the monthly minimums?
* If I *can* pay off the debts right away with a lump-sum, is this a smart thing to do?  I realize that student loans can not be discharged through bankruptcy.  I don't know how much interest I'll pay long-term with the student loan vs the loan + existing debt.


I'm currently trying to get my life in order, so all of this is sort of new and a little scary for me.  Right now I'm stable, but I'm sort of scraping by at $13/hr in a pretty expensive city.

personalfinance,Need help/guidance on consolidating debt!!,"So, my fiancee told me I should check out Reddit for advice.  So, this is what's going on.  I have (2) credit cards, one is at $1,758.51/ 12.99% and the other is at $2,343.80/ 17.99%.  I also have a car payment that is at $10,837.11/ 15.8%.  Totaling $14,939.42.

I have tried refinancing my car but I owe about a $1000 more than what the cars worth so they will not let me refinance.  I have also tried getting my interest rates lowered but the credit card companies will not let me do that either.  With that said, I looked into debt consolidation loans to hopefully get a lower interest rate and pay my debt back quicker...  Well that isn't seeming to work either.  I checked multiple websites for a quick quote (supposedly doesn't affect credit score).  All of which either didn't give me what I needed or gave me extremely high interest rates.  I also applied with my bank (Arvest) and they also denied me.  Told me that I couldn't use my car as a secured loan since it's not paid off and that if I did an unsecured loan, it would only be 10% of my yearly income...

This is all fine and dandy, but I'm not sure how to figure out what the taxed percentage would be for federal and state.

Is there a way to know the percentage that will be taxed? I'm in NY state and I tried googling but I get what I see as conflicting information. It's probably due to my lack of understanding how the system works. People have told me to prepare to be taxed at 30%, but that seems high to me.

personalfinance,Trying to understand mortgage interest rates and how it differs from a standard loan.,"I am a bit confused here. Watched the Kahn Academy videos on mortgages and did some research on Investopedia but I'm still having a lot of trouble wrapping my head around this.



If I have a 10 year student loan and the interest rate is 5% and I owe $100,000. Let's say I bust my ass and make the $105,000 payment within 1 year ($100k original plus 5% interest). I am done with the payment. I saved myself a TON of interest because even though I was set to pay my loan back in 10 years, I paid it back in 1. I only get an additional $5,000 in interest, vs. $50,000 in interest if I waited the full 10 years.

Let's say for sake of ease you have a $400,000 loan on a $500,000 home. You get a 30 year mortgage at 3%. Now if I understand this correctly a mortgage does NOT work like a standard loan. Where the amount of interest you owe is ""fixed"" no matter how quickly you pay it off.

With a mortgage, they frontload a fixed amount of interest. So let's type a hypothetical situation with the $400k loan. If I were to triple my payments I could apply the extra to the principal, but the original payment is almost all interest. 

Essentially it would be like in the 10 year student loan scenario that when I made my $110,000 payment, they said I still owe $40,000. Of the $100,000 payment, only $60,000 of it is applied to the principal (because it's a 10 year loan at 5%, aka $50,000). 

So I assume that's where my confusion lies. By frontloading the interest aren't they charging me interest for time that may go unused if I pay it off early? If within 5 years I go to sell my home and 90% of my mortgage payment was towards interest, wouldn't I have barely made a profit at all unless the market has gone up? If my house is flat in terms of value would I not be getting killed because virtually none of my money would be going to principal? Furthermore, if I were to sell my house in 5 years isn't it totally bizarre for them to apply all this money to 30 years worth of time interest when I only had the loan for 5 years?

If I sell the house in 5 years, wouldn't I probably have paid about 80-85% of the same amount of interest that someone that held their house for the full 30 years since the interest payments are frontloaded?

I am federal employee of fifteen years and recently my [OPM information was hacked](http://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2015/06/opm-breach-notification-frustrates-hacked-feds/115882/?oref=river).  I have just received my pin number to sign up for [CSID](https://www.csid.com/opm/) via my email at work.

In the past two months have been fraudulently signed up for at least two 'Box Store' store credit cards.

I currently have reacted the following way:

1. I called the credit card companies/banks and notified them that these accounts were opened fraudulently and had them immediately closed.
2. I began a 90 fraud alert my credit through Equifax, which carries over to both Experian and Trans Union.

My questions are:

1. Should I sign up with the CSID service? Can the information I give them be compromised as well? I have read in [other posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntsvilleAlabama/comments/3artqa/opm_breach_notification_frustrates_hacked_feds_im/csfjley) that this may be the case.

2. Should I put a freeze on my credit?  I am not planning on any major purchases or loans in the near future.  I might wanna buy a house, but I'm not really sure I want one within the next year.

3. Do you have any suggestions for me?

MachineLearning,Modeling a time series for prediction (but not exactly prediction),"I'm not quite sure on the correct terminology to use so I'll try to explain. In general, I am trying to create a model based on sets of training data which will be able to generate a new time series that has the characteristics of the set of training data is was created against.

My training data consists of 30 second long traces of (time, packetsize) pairs of network traffic. each 30 second long trace generally has about 1,000 - 100,000 pairs (depending on how many packets are sent). The traces are separated out into categories of traffic type (such as streaming video, skype, ftp download, etc).

So a snippet of a trace would look something like this:

    0.0.006825,134
    0.020398,131
    0.026335,40
    0.039872,140
    0.047299,138

Looking at each type of trace, they generally have fairly obvious characteristics (one type will have steady flow versus another type which has more of a wave of flow). I currently create a markov chain based on these parameters, but all of that is done manually. I have a few questions about what would be the appropriate way to train a model to do this.

I have been looking into creating a neural network to do this, but I'm not sure if this is the correct path to take. These are the steps I was going to be taking to format my problem into a NN problem:

* Get rid of the decimal times by choosing a fixed timeslice, and converting my input data into a single list of sizes, where the interleaving times are set to 0 size. (so for instance if I started with [(0.1, 10) (0.2, 12) (0.4, 50)] that would be converted to [10 12 0 50] by simply choosing a timeslice of 0.1 seconds.

* Create a NN with the number of inputs being a large enough number to see over all of the zeros which the above method would create. So if the precision is one value per millisecond, the window would probably have to cover a few thousand data points. The output of the NN would be the next size value directly after the window of inputs. I would have the window increment one position over until the entire dataset had been fed into the NN.

* To generate new traces, randomize the inputs and run the NN to get the next output, continue until the required number of timeslices are output.

Does that all make sense? Or is this not the approach one would take?",technology,1441748909

personalfinance,Paid off or refinanced all of my credit card debt. How should I prioritize my financial goals now?,"Hello all:

I recently finished paying off all of my credit cards and a second mortgage. I accomplished part of this by refinancing my mortgage to $200,000 from $132,000. I also recently bought a new used car and took out a $15k car loan from my bank to pay for it. The rate for the mortgage with Quicken Loans is 4.25% and the rate for the car loan from US Bank is 3.59%. These are my only two debts now*.

At this point, I'm not sure which of my goals to tackle next so I'll list them below:

* Pay more on mortgage principal each month. The current payment is $1378 and doubling the payment on principal each month would be about $277.
* Establish an emergency fund. Right now I keep about $2000 in my savings account for unexpected expenses. I also have about $65,000 in available credit if I need it. My goal is to eventually have 12 months of expenses in the bank. My monthly expenses are about $5k.
* Maximize annual 401k contributions. Currently I'm contributing enough to get the full employer match. I am 49 years old with about $100k in my 401k. I know this is very low.
* Fund a traditional IRA for my spouse annually. She doesn't work outside the home and doesn't have any retirement savings (besides mine).
* Pay off recent car loan. I have to keep it open for a year to avoid penalties and the rate is lower than my mortgage so I think this is lowest priority.

*I have a son who is a sophomore college and one who is a junior in high school. We have been paying as we go with the older one and having him take out unsubsidized loans from Sallie Mae as needed.

personalfinance,150K in student loan debt- is PSLF my golden ticket out of debt or just a bad gamble?,"So I recently graduated in August with my doctorate of physical therapy degree with 150K in debt (for undergrad and grad school combined). The loans are roughly 40K in private loans (w/ average of 8% interest rate) and 110K in federal unsubsidized loans (w/ average of 6.6% interest rate). The loans don't go into repayment until mid-November due to the 6 month grace period. Right now I have $5,500 in my bank account.

OPTION #1- If I pay off my loans with the standard option my payments will be about $1600 per month but I anticipate being able to pay $2000 per month and have it paid off in 7-10 years by using the monthly extra to go towards the higher interest private loans first. This will be using approximately 50% of my monthly salary towards loans, with the rest going to rent, utilities, food, 401K (just up until my employers matching %), and an emergency savings fund.

OPTION #2- The other option is applying to income based repayment (IBR) for the federal loans, which will lower the monthly payment and allow me to throw all the money towards the private loans- and then use PSLF (public service loan forgiveness) to get the approximately $45,000 balance of federal loans forgiven in 10 years (*if I calculated this right*). This will be cheaper than option 1 but also risky because if PSLF is ever eliminated as a program, I will have built up a lot of interest and have a giant chunk of debt to deal with unless I get grandfathered in. Also, what if I have to move or get fired in a few years and am unable to find another nonprofit job in time to meet the requirements.

In terms of PSLF requiring you to work at a nonprofit hospital, this is actually my goal either way regardless of which option I choose. All of my dream jobs are at nonprofit hospitals in the city and I have had some interviews so far and have another very promising second interview later this week. Average starting pay for that area is roughly $65,000 plus benefits. You don't make much more money comparitively in a nonprofit area unless you are working a travel PT job or large nursing home- which I don't want to do.

So- should I choose option #1 or 2 and why?",finance,1441758350

Forbes Magazine didn't say anything along the lines of ""we're sorry, and we will handle the collection agency and won't let them do anything to your credit reports."" The lack of decent customer service and ethics are underlining reasons why magazine subscriptions are in a decline.

personalfinance,"24, college student, ~$17,000 in debt charged-off by US Bank. Need advice!","Hi r/personalfinance.

Contrary to my throwaway username, I made some pretty bad choices a few years ago that are just now catching up to me. When I entered college as a freshman, I somehow had excellent credit (most likely from my parents opening up a credit card in my name) and US Bank offered me a premier line of credit when I went in to cash a check. Not really knowing what it was, I said sure, since the clerk explained that it would help me out in case of an emergency. The premier line was for $10,000. They also set me up with a reserve line for $5,000.

Sophomore year I lost financial support from my parents for school. Little by little, I ended up eating away at the premier line of credit - to pay for rent, food, and tuition. Near the end of the year I got in some legal trouble and used the reserve line to pay $4,000 in legal fees. Although I stopped there, the damage was already done.

In the ensuing couple of years (I'm a fifth year senior) I have more often than not been unable to pay the monthly balance of $200, in large part due to my own financial mismanagement. With interest and late fees my debt has gone up to a total of about $17,000. When I returned to school at the beginning of the summer I was dead broke and barely making it by, and so did not make a payment for several months. However, having obtained employment last month, I decided to start tackling my debt and begin to pay off as much as I could. However, when I logged in to my online US Bank account, I saw that the loans had disappeared from my account listing. Fearing that US Bank had sold my debt to an outside agency, I gave them a call and they informed me that my debt had been charged-off. The individual I spoke with informed me that I could start making payments, although my credit score would be negatively impacted every 40 days due to a balance being held. He also mentioned a second option, wherein I make an offer to settle the debt in a lump sum amount.

I'm at a complete loss and don't know what to do. At first I thought about getting some sort of student loan to cover the debt and defer payment until I graduate, but after I looked into it that doesn't seem to be a viable option. There's no way I can get enough money to even settle the debt, unless I have family who would be willing to give/lend me that amount of money. There is a small chance that my grandparents would be willing to help me out, possibly up to $10,000, but I would feel like a tool asking them for money and I'm not even sure if that would be enough to settle my debt.

Here is my income and expenses for the next year (I graduate in June):

Financial aid: +$2,000 per quarter after tuition
Work: +$500-600 a month (I can't work any more than I do right now due to an intensive courseload)
Rent: -$500 a month
Food: -$200 a month

What can she do?","A few months ago my sister stopped paying her Federal student loans. Her and my parents aren't on the greatest terms and because of their lack of communication, the ending result was my mother getting a notification from her employer that 20-25% of her bi-weekly paycheck would be garnished. So now my mom is falling behind on other bills and has just informed me that she plans to take out a personal loan to help the costs. This seems like a bad idea to me.

My sister has been a stay at home mom still graduating (now 30yrs old) and just this week started working part time. But only about 10hrs a week at $10/hour. Her husband makes okay money. I would guess around 50 maybe 60. I really don't know. My sister says my mom should take out a personal loan because she makes more money (75k) and would qualify for more than her. There is still 20k left on this federal loan. 

My mom is already near 50 and I'm worried this will put her over the edge. She already works 2 jobs and has 2 kids at home, although they are 18yrs of age. My mom says she doesn't have any option. I have just started teaching myself the basics of personal finances so I cannot help her. What other options can she look into?

Sorry I don't know the exact details. My mom cannot seem to talk about it anytime I bring it up. If you need to know more please ask and I can hopefully find out.",finance,1441771312

I want to use it as a currency, but the constant talk here about increasing block size from 1 to 10 or 20 or 3 or 5000 or f*** all, every site I think is legit isn't, don't use this or that, do use this BUT F*** WAIT DONT!

The hell. You're telling me the whole thing could fork to whatever the hell bitcoin ""XT"" is and I'll have to keep track of that too? I just want to use bitcoin. I don't want to have to read to use my money as money.

I get that the value changes, thats normal, and I can deal with that. But the fact that all of you are making every change out to be the end of the world, guess what. I don't want any part of it anymore. You know what I don't have to do with usd or my debit or credit card? Learn new terms. Figure out if my bank is a scam tomorrow.

I've had a few drinks, and I'm sick of sitting on the sidelines not knowing what the F*** is going on anymore.

Explain this shit in a paragraph. What is bitcoin in its current state. What the hell is going on. ELI5 this shit so I can still say to people, ""buy bitcoin, its worth it!"" ""you can totally use it as a currency and no your money wont be gone tomorrow!""

I'll get to the point(feel free to ask more details and I'll gladly answer, just don't want to fluff more then necessary). The monthly payment is 470, gotta have full coverage, the my interest rate is high as hell. 

I considered bankruptcy(Ch7), after looking at my free credit report most of my debt's actually settled(stuff I forgot I paid off). The outstanding debt(minus this car loan) I can likely clean up in about 6-8 months with payment plans, even faster if I'm aggressive about it. So it kinda made me think to take the CH7 off of the table for now.

So I want to know how bad is a voluntary repo if I don't plan on financing anything in the near future? I'd try my best to settle the debt on the car since it'll likely be around 10-13K after they auction it off. It's worth 14K(KBB) but I'm thinking worse case scenario.

Long term I wanna build my credit and eventually buy a home, but thats far off, probably a good 5+ years off. If I'm ok with the consequences of the repo is it that bad? And how likely am I to be sued for the remaining 8-10K? I figure a lawyer would be worth hiring to sue me for that amount on the banks part.

This is because I have write offs scarring my score.  
  
  
I've never been approved for a credit card. A few years ago I'd even specifically googled the easiest cards to get and was declined for those. I haven't applied for any type of credit in at least 2 years. 
  
For the last 3 years I have paid a car loan with perfect timeliness. I recently paid off the remaining 7,000 in one large payment (per this subs recommendation about the small inheritance I was receiving) and now the title is clear.  
  
Do you think my credit score will go up now that I don't have a $7000 loan?    
I just paid it off in August, should I wait a few more months before checking my score?  
Should I just get a secured credit card for a couple years?

A few things to note

* this is to build a down payment - I can definitely increase payments after I purchase the new house
* I am _also_ looking for other ways to increase cash flow
* I do appreciate that the total payment is much more, but I've divided the interest difference over the years to create a ""monthly"" interest surcharge, which negatively impacts savings
* I'm also aware that the net savings is fictitious because - once the ""today"" loan would've been paid off, then there's no savings (in fact, it's $$ that I wouldn't have been paying).

personalfinance,(UK) Taking out a private student-focussed loan,"I am considering taking out a £2,500 loan at a fixed interest rate of 12.5% before I graduate, and 10.5% after I graduate.

I begin making repayments immediately, I pay £20/month up until October 2016 and then the repayments are fixed at £36/month for 8 years (£3 more than my phone contract, heh) and I end up paying back around £4,500.

I work two jobs, but I won't be able to keep doing this whilst I am studying so I will need to drop one, which will hit my finances hard. I have no savings, I've had to live off of my student overdraft and loan before I was working. Banks won't lend to me as my credit rating isn't good enough, but I am getting a credit card off of which I will pay for small things like lunch, to slowly build it up.

This £2,500 loan would just cover my living costs. I know that I can keep up with the repayments, I am getting a cheaper phone contract next month (£17/month) and I've had no trouble paying my current one on time.

It's just the thought of taking out a loan, it just feels wrong. I've never had to do this before. I'm at odds with myself whether or not to proceed. Will having a loan of this nature (it's provided by a private student finance company regulated by the FCA) negatively impact upon my already fairly non-existent credit rating, or will it help build it up? I know I can keep up with the payments, that's not my problem... 

It sucks that I've gotta pay £2000 more back to them but that's just the cost of education, I guess. My university doesn't have any bursaries available, they only do those for first year students and I am going into my final year. I can get no parental support, either.

personalfinance,I'm needing to dip into private student loans for the last semester of my mechanical engineering degree and am looking for some perspective to help me wade through my options.,"**The Situation and My Questions:**

I only have one more class (enrolled right now) to get my mechanical engineering bachelors, but my federal aid ran out in the spring when I was supposed to graduate (graduation had already been delayed and I'd already gone through SAP appeals to keep my federal grants and subsidized loans up that long). I'm currently enrolled part-time (to get my federal loans back in deferment so they don't kick in this fall while I'm still in class, and give me more time to find a job, get into grad school, and or get my startup projects off the ground) and **need ~$4k for tuition**. Usually my grants and subsidized loans would cover that, but those are out now so I have to look into private options to finish out.

So my issue now is that I'm looking at all these loan options through my schools alternative loans page, and I'm a little unsure of where to start chipping away at coming to a final choice (the federal loans were basically ""this is how it is. do you want it or not?"" and I haven't actually dealt with a regular loan before).

Through my school's 'Fast Choice' site, the lenders that survived the filtering process are SallieMae, SunTrust, WellsFargo, PNC, UnionFederal, and Citizen'sBank. All with fixed and variable rate options. Do any of these have a particularly good or bad reputation around here? Is there anything I should watch out for? If I go with one of them for a private student loan then how long does it usually take to process (in case I need to adjust for late fees with the university)? Does that go to the university first like federal aid (with a delayed overage check), or does it come to me so I have to handle paying the university?

Are there any other options I have here?

If I can access more than I need for tuition, then could I leverage that to fund some products I'm developing to license or sell, or to start a small business or other source of income to pay off my loans? What sort of restrictions are there on that?

**Relevant details.**

Current Income: Negligible. I do some little stuff for cash here or there when I need it, but otherwise spend most of my time studying, working with various orgs, or working with a couple business partners on our 'garage-stage' tech startups. I've leveraged all the federal aid I could to cover school costs up till now so that I could invest my free time in learning things that make me more capable or producing things that could grow into businesses or otherwise provide income in the near future (which keeps me too busy for much beyond intermittent part-time work).

GPA: &gt;3.0

Total Fed loans so far: ~$30k (mostly subsidized, but I had to get into unsubbed a bit towards the end).

After searching around reddit for a bit I discovered Credit Karma and found out my credit score is in the low 700's. I'm not entirely sure if that gives me more or less options, or if there's anything I should do to improve it. I only have a debit card (got a credit card once at JCPenny's that was set up to get me a significant discount on a suit I needed to get around Congress with some legislation my student movement was writing, and then expire as soon as I paid it off. I did that as fast as possible to avoid getting any weird charges so I don't have one now).

Through my school's 'Fast Choice' site, the lenders that survived the filtering process are SallieMae, SunTrust, WellsFargo, PNC, UnionFederal, and Citizen'sBank. All with fixed and variable rate options.

**Maybe more or less relevant details:**

I've had a bit of a weird history with financial aid. I had some 'Satisfactory Academic Progress' issues a couple years into bachelors even though I was doing great and was ahead of schedule because I'd done two prior years at community college (paid out of pocket with no aid, but somehow counted against progress) and the credits transferred, but the classes didn't. That got me stuck in SAP appeals. I also took opportunities to work at a large engineering company (which played havoc with the class schedule that year), and to take the better part of a year off to start a new program at the university. Those stretched the appeals to their limits, and were just enough to see me through graduation last spring, but I did to come back for one more class this fall and was basically told that I don't have access to any federal aid anymore (so no more pell grants or subsidized loans).

In a worse case scenario I do have a reasonably effective safety net with the family-run business(es) (In a less-than-ideal situation where I can't sell the products I'm working on, and demand for engineers drops through the floor, I could be helping run a mom'n'pop pizzeria and working odd construction jobs with my brother on the side).",finance,1441831889

personalfinance,Do people here know about NACA mortgages? I have a 30 year 0.75% fixed rate mortgage.,"I keep seeing posts about how to buy a house with a limited down payment, and it seems like people might benefit from knowing about this.  I remember looking up NACA on reddit when we were going through the process and not finding anything worthwhile.  We learned about this through a home-buying class with the city's community education program.  No one else we knew had gone through the program at the time that we were doing it, but another friend of ours has since bought a house using the program (and our realtor apparently used it to buy her house after that).

Full disclosure: I don't get anything out of posting this, I just think more people should know about it.

My wife and I bought our house last summer using the program.  We could have scraped together about 25-30 grand for a down payment, but 150k doesn't buy what we wanted in Minneapolis, and it would have tapped us out savings-wise.  We were approved through a credit union with a 4.5% rate, but the base rate through NACA was 3.5% at the time.  It looks like it is 3.75% right now.  

The Pros:
- We did not put any money down.
- We did not pay closing costs at least not more than $500 or so.  Normally, these are several thousand.
- We have a normal 30 year fixed rate mortgage (through Citi in Minnesota, but I think they use BofA elsewhere).
- We do not pay PMI or any other monthly costs (NACA used to have a $50 monthly fee, but dropped it right before we bought)
- We bought the interest rate down from 3.5% to 0.75%.  NACA charges 1% of the cost of the mortgage for a .25% reduction in rate.  We used the seller contributions (4%) and paid 7% (about $17k) of our money to buy down the interest rate.  
- Because they are qualifying on the basis of monthly payment, our $210,000 in student loans in IBR/PAYE status did not phase them in the least.  
- The interest rate does not change based on credit score, because they use the monthly number to qualify you rather than overall credit.  They talk a lot about how they can qualify you even with bad credit.  

The upshot is that we bought our house for $243,000 and pay about $1170 a month for PITI, with about 600 of that going to principal.  Only about 150 bucks a month is interest.  

The Cons:
- You can't already own a house and keep it, and you have to live in the NACA house for the life of the loan.  That is the only limitation we were worried about.  There are no income or neighborhood limitations, and the maximum house price is high enough to not be a factor in our area.
- They ask you to volunteer for them sometimes, and try to make it seem like you are required to.  It is not a binding thing at all though.
- The process takes a while.  It took us about 6-7 months start to finish.  About 2 months of that time was us looking at houses.
- There is a ton of paperwork.  Even more so than normal, as I understand it.
- You sometimes have to drop everything else to do things when they ask.  It helps if you have a flexible job to get away during the day.
- They have some strange requirements for inspection and repair.  Essentially, you have to either get the sellers to fix the issues with the house prior to closing or deposit the estimated amount to fix any issues in escrow and deal with it later.  We used this to negotiate an extra point in seller's contributions, but getting a licensed contractor to do a couple thousand in repairs was a challenge.  
- They can take 30-60 days to close.  This can be a deal-killer, but we ended up closing in about a month and a half and it worked fine.
- They can be kind of slow and bureaucratic, so you have to be kind of pushy and on top of things to make sure that things get done.  That said, we felt like the staff at our office were always good to us, and really came through when we needed to get things done with the central office.  

We ended up feeling like we got the best deal going.  We looked at it as a little bit of a temporary second job, but we are a little more pushy than the average bear.  Buying down the interest rate that much might not make sense for every situation, but we are comfortable staying in this house for a few years.  We'll have the same amount of equity in our house at the end of 7 years as a 4.5% mortgage with a 10% down payment and we've saved about $500 a month considering we don't have PMI.  That pays back our interest rate buydown in about 3 years.

personalfinance,Question about how to best use an inheritance,"Hi all,

I'm not asking for myself, but for my in-laws. I'm not completely privy to all the financial information.

So back story. My father-in-law (FIL) is 55 and is planning on retiring soon from his government job within the next few months. Between his pension and 401k, he expects to maintain the same take home pay. (I'm not sure what that is, but my husband guesses his salary was in the low $100s.) He plans on supplementing that income with jobs more aligned with his interests like video editing or teaching part-time at a local community college.

My mother-in-law (MIL) is 52. She's been part time self-employed with a small painting business since my husband was school age. I've gathered it's just been a way to make some extra cash and keep busy. Thus, she doesn't have any retirement savings for herself.

They also have a mortgage and had their house refinanced about 10 years ago. They bought the house 25 years ago. I don't know how much they have left on it or how much their monthly payments are.

Up to speed? Okay. So, my MIL just got an inheritance from her father. My husband expects it's a decent sum. My FIL wants to take it and put it into a retirement or savings account.

My husband recommended to take the money and put a lump payment into their mortgage. That's what makes most sense to me because I don't know of any way they can get a higher, secure, ROI than their mortgage interest rate. Plus, if they don't have a mortgage payment by the time they fully retire, my FIL's savings would cover them both and they wouldn't need an income from her. 

However, I have to wonder if my FIL foresees downsizing to a smaller house in the next few years. We live in Denver, which is a very hot sellers market with not much indication of slowing down. And if after selling and paying the rest of their existing mortgage, my FIL anticipates being able to a smaller house with either no mortgage or a small mortgage, why sink a liquid asset into it?

I'm also not familiar with the retirement account options out there. Is there any account that could get a good interest rate or catch up benefits? Or one where she can deposit the money to avoid the inheritance taxes?

I would really appreciate any recommendations I can give my in-laws. Plus, I'm just curious for myself. :P

personalfinance,"Small business owner wanting to get rid of small amount of personal credit card debt. Should I open a line of credit, personal loan (secured/unsecured) as a faster means to pay off my small debt?","Hey there guys. So about a year ago I started a wood working business. I do it out of my detached garage so I have zero overhead costs aside from paying for power, maintenance of tools, and paying myself. For most of the year, all profits have went in to investing in production equipment which is expensive. But once you have a good tool, you basically have it for life.

About a year ago I took about 8k on my personal credit line to pay for some larger tools for my shop to have a good start with. 
I have a full-time job at the hospital that pays the bills, but I've had some terrible financial luck in the means of big bills coming in (truck breaking down, gf borrowing car and it breaking down, random bills etc) so I haven't been able to pay off my card as great as I wanted to. So I'm sitting at about 3.7k in debt.

My credit is around 730, and my credit card interest is 14.9%
I always pay whatever I can from my hospital paycheck to the credit card. I know not to do minimum payments. My wood working profits have been investing in more tools and what not so I haven't always been able to rely on paying off the credit debt.

But lately, I've acquired pretty much all of the production tools I need, and this month I made over 2.5k in profit so far and plan to net much more on a custom cabinetry job. I honestly have faith in my business, as I'm currently booked a month or two in advance since I started through word of mouth only-- but I just need to tell myself to charge more to really bring home good money aside from my full time job at the hospital. But lately, my initial investment has been paying off and the profits have been increasing in my business. I think I lucked out with not having to pay overhead or insurance, since I have full-coverage insurance with my hospital job. So even if I don't make money, my wallet doesn't take a hit.

I'm going in to cash a 2.5k check at my credit union tomorrow, but was wondering if it would be a good idea to talk about opening up a line of credit, personal loan, or even business loan to lower my interest rates on my personal debt. 
I was thinking having a few thousand to show around would help convince them to give me a loan -- at a decent rate. I checked online and an unsecured private loan has an APR of 8.9% which seems kind of high but is lower than 14.9% on my credit card.

I was thinking of using the cash I have to pay off my current bills and fixing my vehicle (everything the gf touches dies apparently) and using the rest to pay down on my card. 

Has anyone else taken out a loan at a lower interest rate to pay off their credit card debt? Is this a good idea?

I wouldn't mind taking out a business loan either to buy a few last tools for my shop that aren't essential, but would save loads of time. (drum sander, better dust collection system to help my lungs when not using my respirator etc) but I'm hesitant to not put myself more in to debt-- i don't really *need* those things, but it would be nice to have.

I do have a savings, but it's in the form of a 401k(the hospital matches my 6% contribution). I do plan to save more when I'm in the black with my credit card but in the meantime, if the shit hit the fan, i could have the credit card to fall back on. 

I'm only 24, but owning my own business and working full-time has been working out so far. Aside from the small amount of debt, I love what I do, and as long as I make enough to pay the bills, and put some away in the piggy bank, I wouldn't have life any other way.

*JUST POSTING FOR DISCUSSION*

http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/09/most_nj_workers_anxious_about_affording_retirement.html#incart_most-comments

&gt;The hard-to-accept reality is that “retirement” is a relatively modern concept and is probably a failed experiment. The idea of stopping work at 65 (less for public employees) and spending the next 10 to 25 years going on cruises and playing bingo is something new.  

&gt;Retirement, throughout most of history, meant working until you could no longer work and then your family took care of you for a few years until you “moved on”.

&gt;Even when Social Security was introduced, it was a means to give people some independence in their final years and make sure they weren’t destitute. The life expectancy was about the same as the retirement age. It was never about providing decades of retirement income.  

&gt;Then, over the past few decades, retirement took on a new meaning; a vacation that could potentially last decades.

&gt;But, what we are finding is that this probably isn’t realistic for most people. Companies found out they can’t provide decades of paid vacation (pensions) for people who no longer work and remain solvent, so they cut those off. Social Security will run out in a few decades. Like many states, NJ can’t afford its pension for public workers. And, it’s not just NJ, but many states, the Federal government and most of Europe who are facing retirement benefit crises. And, most people simply won’t be able to save enough on their own, even with a 401k match, to fund a lengthy retirement. Most people can’t afford to lose a week or two of pay, never mind decades.       

&gt;Sorry folks, but the modern concept of retirement is about to change

&gt;By phiremin

So what does everyone think? I understand the idea of early retirement in the financial independence world, but how do you see this effecting your own retirement plans. If 90% of people can't afford their own retirement I see alot of people attacking(verbally, sentiment, taxes even) the ones that can.

TLDR; Retirement is a new concept, 90% of people/governments/companies can't afford to give 20 years of paid vacation (retirement) to people who live long.

personalfinance,"How to invest a 1,000,000€ inheritance?","Hello /r/personalfinance.

My girlfriend of 7 years has recently inherited a fairly sizeable inheritance, and would like to know what would be the best way to invest it.

Earlier this year she has inherited ~1,000,000€, in cash, on a ""savings account"" (I'm not quite certain on the correct terminology in English, but it's the type of account where you put your money in for a predetermined period of time for a larger interest rate).

 The savings period has expired recently, and she’s still unsure what to do with the large amount of money. 

 
**Her current financial situation is like this:**


* No debt whatsoever
* Inherited an apartment she currently lives in, just has to pay utilities
* Inherited a large house with a pool at the beach, in a touristy location
* Currently employed, making around 12,000 € per year in a country where the average annual wage is less than 9,000€
* She is planning to quit her job by the end of the year because the house she inherited at the beach is in a nice location and is well suited for renting. It is fully furnished, requiring only some touch ups to make it more exclusive, but should net her a fair amount from renting each summer, up to 30,000€ if done right


She is a very risk averse person, so she would prefer the majority of her assets to be low risk, so we were looking into S&amp;P 500 and government bonds mostly, plus a certain amount in a state insured savings account.  

The savings accounts can have interest rates up to 2.8-3.0% annually, if a longer savings period is chosen, and the government guarantees for up to 100,000€ as is the case in most of Europe (we’re currently not sure if this is per person, or per bank account, we will look into it).

She doesn’t really live an extravagant life, but she would like to buy a new car, up to 40,000€, that she would plan to keep for up to 10 years (the beach house and the apartment are in different parts of the country, it’s quite a long trip, her 2003 Toyota Yaris isn’t quite well suited for the trip), and maybe travel a little, but as far as luxuries go that’s pretty much it. We both understand that a car that expensive is a luxury and not a bare necessity.


However, we’re both not experienced in this kind of thing, and would like to see what kind of asset allocation /r/personalfinance would recommend. A mixture of predominantly lower risk investments with some higher risk ones? We would also like to know about any possible pitfalls and common problems we might be forgetting about.

* Flexibility: Choose from a wide range of MFS mutual funds.

* Earnings are tax deferred.

* Withdrawals are free from federal tax if used for qualified higher education expenses. You will be subject to federal income tax on your earnings and may face a 10% federal tax penalty if you withdraw money for something other than qualified higher education expenses.

* The plan is good for full- or part-time students at virtually any accredited post-secondary school.

* The beneficiary may be changed to one within the same family.1

* The owner retains control of the assets.

* You can contribute up to $14,000 per year ($28,000 per married couple) per bene$ciary with-out any federal gift tax consequences. Or you can take advantage of the unique accelerated gifting feature of a 529 plan to make a combined $ve-year gift of up to $70,000 ($140,000 per married couple) to each bene$ciary in a single year.

I'm about to start a job in the next few weeks where I will be making slightly more than $150k, with salary increases every year. Relative to my peers, I don't have a ton of debt but I would like to discharge it within 3 years so that I have career flexibility. I am also very serious about saving my money for future but presently-unknown goals (house, etc.). Aside from the expenses of living in NYC, I intend to throw as much money as I can towards loan repayment and saving/investing.

My question is what I should do with the money I will be making this year. Due to my salary, this is likely the last taxable year that I will be able to take advantage of a number of tax-favorable retirement accounts, so I am wondering whether to stash some money away this year in an IRA of some sort. 

This year, after all my expenses are paid for (including killing off all the interest on my loans [about $5k] before it capitalizes), I anticipate having about $18k in extra money. I am wondering how to allocate it. I've done a lot of research and am looking for outside opinions. My ideas were some sort of combination of:

1. Pay off more of loans
2. Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA
3. Stash in savings account as an emergency fund.

I'm basically looking for advice on how much money to put towards each item.

I should mention that my employer does not match and I probably won't be able to start contributing to their 401(k) plan until next year.

1. I have student loans of $11,900 at an interest rate of 6.5%, and another batch of loans, $52390 at 7.65%.

Monthly net after 403b contribution: $1710

Student loan debt: ~$8500

Credit score according to Credit Karma: 557

This is due to my mother opening some credit cards in my name while I was in college, which she defaulted on. I subsequently defaulted on my student loans because I was trying to pay down those higher-interest credit cards. I am fairly confused by my credit report, and want to go about getting some of the derogatory marks deleted, but that’s a topic for another day.

I am currently on a payment plan for my student loans, paying $275/month. This may sound terrible, but I don't know the interest rate. Since it was in default, I'm assuming it's over 12%.

1) Is it better to use my emergency fund to try and settle the student loan for less than I owe, or to continue making monthly payments until I can feasibly pay the entire balance? Is my credit 
score negatively affected if I settle versus paying in full? I am nervous about depleting my emergency fund, but I could also save so much more each month without the student loan payment.

2) If I go the settlement route, how much do you think I could reasonably settle this debt for?

3) I am thinking about getting a credit card to start rebuilding my credit (I will probably need a new car within two years). The plan is to put a few automatic drafts on it (Netflix, car insurance), and set up an auto-pay from my checking account to pay it down every month. Is this a good idea?

He made it clear that once you're accepted the rate would be sub-10%. It may not sound like much but it was an opportunity to cover myself a little more in case I needed the credit card. When the paper came out to sign the apr stated that it was 22.15% and when I asked about it he said that ""This is just introductory paperwork and it will go down before your first billing."" 


I went in there for a second time the day or so before the first bill was due and he said pay this first one and it will come down. We went in a third time a week or so after he said this because it still hasn't come down.

Hey all, I've recently been very frustrate because of my current financial situation. I'm 24 years old, about to be 25, and still unable to afford to move out of my parents house. To sum it up quickly I had a string of bad jobs, and some problems with credit when I was younger, and now I have a mediocre job and am having to finance my schooling through the Between the Matresses lending co. I'm working on my degree which should help me with my value in the workplace by a ton, but right now, after my phone bill car payment, school payments, and insurance I cant nearly afford to move out. My parents have given me 6 months to do so as my father who has back problems needs to move into a single floor house and they eloquently stated 'you living with us is not part of our 5 year plan'. This is fine, they don't owe me anything, but I find myself in a bit of a bind.

While talking with my bank over the phone about ways to get the interest rate down, the rep mentioned that he could offer me a 0% APR (for 12 months) cash advance from that card into my checking account for up to $3,000.

* Credit card balance after the transfer: $8,000 (maxed out)

* Checking account balance: $mycash+$3,000

He said I could then make a $3,000 payment from my checking account back to the credit card.

* Credit card balance after payment: $5,000 (no net change)

* Checking account balance: $mycash (no net change)

Here's the trick: since payments are applied to the highest interest debt first, my credit card debt would break down as follows:

* Balance transfers: $3,000 ( at 0% APR until October 2016, then 17% APR thereafter)

* Purchases: $2,000 (at 17% APR)

I figure this would cut my monthly finance charges down to 2/5 of what they were before, saving me money. Meanwhile, I don't end up with a hard credit check, and it doesn't mess with the average age of my revolving credit accounts.

4. Bought another car in May, paid in full before first bill was due- my wife's name was first with me as co-signer

(This is all due to a hefty settlement from a motorcycle accident and needing to get rid of 2 shitty cars)

We don't currently have any debt, but with my credit score being so ""average"", I'm worried that I won't be able to get a good interest rate with a mortgage.

- Every month my ex-wife sends a child support check (just under $800) and I put $400 a month into 2 savings accounts for my kids because they're mom stole $20,000 out of their college funds. (not important but my daughter is 19, ex no longer pays for her which dropped the weekly check by 1/2)

- Around $500 in debt to a TV store

- Around $9,000 in current debt (not really) to my car that has a 6% interest rate compounded monthly. That's how much I have left to pay off the car I bought awhile ago. The minimum payment on that is $200 a month, but people keep telling me to forget about my credit debt (only a $25 minimum) and pay off the car because when I go to sell my house they'll look at that and say ""Oh look his credit has a minimum of $25 but he chose to pay more to that over his truck which has a minimum of $200""... something along those lines that just what someone told me.                             -Gist of that, I pay $200 a month to my truck and no more

- Monthly mortgage costs just under $1,500 a month

- Currently pay just about $500 for insurance on 4 cars and my bike (currently only 3; daughters, sons, my car, and my motorcycle)

- $200 phone bill for all of us

- $800 a month for food and gas (spent randomly. Usually just 1 $200-300 trip to the grocery store and then the rest is fast food or money incase my son/daughter need money)

- $200 spent on misc stuff (which shall go unmentioned)

- ~$40 a month to my ex's insurance for my son (she's got a better plan than I do and pays half. He turns 18 soon and she'll kick him off her insurance and he'll go on mine, which I'm not sure how much it'll go up)

- $335 a month to a bank. I took a loan out awhile ago. That's just a fixed payment, can't change it or anything.

- $8 a month to netflix

- Roughly $200 a month to comed

- $40 a month to Nicor for heat and air

- $105 a month to the city for water

- $180 a month to comcast

- $100 a month to my attorney because I have to call her several times a month (I already have a lot of debt with her but she's cool about it) because my ex is a psycho and attempts suing me at least once a month (long story).

- $80 a month to the TV shop. I mentioned it earlier (~$500 in debt to them left). I believe they interest rate will disappear if I manage to pay it all back by the end of the year, if not it'll be added to the remainder of my debt.

- Here's a long one. Set up a payment to pay my credit debt (on 3 of 5 credit cards (the ones with 18$ or 22.5%) for just $100 a month. I was thinking about taking another loan out from my bank to pay off all of that ~$8,000 credit debt because my banks interest is lower than the creditors so I thought I could make my future payments shorten.

I believe that is it. My daughter has a full time job and helps me pay things when she can, but I didn't include anything of hers into this post because I'm not going to rely on her to pay bills, more importantly she doesn't pay anything frequently (what I'm saying is she doesn't just commit $X a month to me, she'll pay her car insurance and whatever else she has left to pay. Sometimes it's the phone bill, sometimes it's the gas bill, etc).

The only real variables here are a few things: I can change my payments to my bank and instead of paying $100 a month I can pay more or less. The other loan I took out from another bank. I can pay more/less to food and gas (I work for a car dealership and they've let me 'test drive' the cars. They pay the gas bill for me)

Adding that up correctly, I paid about $4,588 *last* month (like I said it's varied from month to month as I sometimes get paid more/less, and sometimes I get fucked by a random bill or 5). Again, I take home, on average, $4,200 a month. I just sold my old truck for $3,100 today (cash) which the majority will be loose money I will have, and cash burns a hole in my pocket. And to reiterate, I have just about $9,000 in debt total taking into account everything I owe (not taking into account my attorneys fees but leave that alone), I have random bills here and there which usually puts me at my tipping point because I have no way of paying for it and it just is tacked onto the credit.

Oh and one more thing, I get paid about half my monthly salary twice a month. In other words that ~4,200 hundred is split up into two payments on the 15th and 30th. I usually pay most everything off on my list on the first half of the month (because everything I really need to pay is due by then, and most other things are kind of just, ""Pay it by the end of the month"" type of deal, so it's all taken care of.

Lastly, few more short things. I have literally no retirement and I would love to begin an account for myself (I have no clue how I manage my money that way). Other than that, building up a savings account would be amazing but it's no where near my top priority. 

The transmission on my motorcycle recently went out and I have to buy an entire new setup which'll cost anywhere from $1,000-5,000. And before you say anything... I know. That's a dream that should be left unfinished for awhile.

worldpolitics,Stock Market turmoil and conflicts over ruling class 'easy money' policy,"11 September 2015

The lead-up to the meeting next week of the US Federal Reserve, at which it will decide whether to lift interest rates for the first time since the beginning of the global financial crisis in September 2008, has turned into a battleground.

Despite the fact that Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who is said to favour an interest rate increase sometime this year, has made clear that any initial rise will be small and that any further movements will be gradual, large sections of the financial markets are demanding that the near-zero base rate remain in place.

They are making their demands known through large sell-offs on stocks on Wall Street, causing violent swings in the market, in response to any data that suggest that the Fed may begin to move.

A typical example occurred on Wednesday. Following a 7.7 percent rise in the Japanese market, the largest since October 2008, Wall Street jumped on opening. But then came the news that a key jobs survey, said to be closely watched by Yellen, had shown that total job openings in the US had risen to 5.75 million for July, up from 5.32 million in June. This was the occasion for a major sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing 239 points down, a swing for the day of 411 points. This was because the jobs report was considered to increase the likelihood of an interest rate increase.

The market gyrations are an expression of the toxic combination of greed and fear that underlies financial markets, arising from their parasitic dependence upon ultra-cheap money as the source of profits and wealth.

Powerful financial interests are motivated simply by the determination that nothing should be done to in any way curb their speculative activities. But this outright greed and the insistence that the Fed and other regulatory bodies are there to serve their interests is not the only factor in the present situation.

There is also the fear that financial markets, and the global capitalist system more broadly, have become so dependent on cheap money that any lessening of its supply and steps toward the return of a more normal monetary regime, no matter how small, can collapse the whole system like a house of cards.

This view has been articulated by two of the world’s major economic institutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as a number of financial commentators. As one commentator on CNBC put it recently, if markets are so concerned about a possible 0.25 percent increase in rates, then the problems of the world economy are more serious than anyone previously thought.

On Wednesday, the chief economist of the World Bank, Kaushik Basu, told the Financial Times that the Fed risked setting off “panic and turmoil” if it decided to lift rates at next week’s meeting and should wait until the world economy had stabilised.

Pointing to the impact of the August 11 devaluation of the Chinese currency and what it indicated, Basu said: “The world economy is looking so troubled that if the US goes for a very quick move in the middle of this I feel it is going to affect countries quite badly.”

He said the World Bank’s forecast for global growth of 2.8 percent, made only last June, was now under threat because of the slowdown in economies such as China and Brazil as well as other major industrial nations and that “overall we are going to get into a slow growth phase.”

“All this put together and what has happened over the past two weeks with the Chinese markets leads one to believe that the scenario is looking worse than it did even in June,” he said.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already come out against a rate rise, with managing director Christine Lagarde stating last June that any increase should be put off until sometime next year. One of the major fears of the IMF is that a rate rise could set off a flight of capital from emerging markets which have become highly dependent on dollar-denominated debt.

So unstable are financial markets that the positions advanced by the IMF and World Bank could themselves be the trigger for significant turbulence if the Fed does decide to lift rates because the divergence of views will be seen as a major cause for concern, leading to a sell-off.

On the other hand, some central bankers in emerging markets consider that the uncertainty about what the Fed will do is itself a considerable cause of instability and that a rate rise should be announced. This view was articulated by Mirza Adityaswara, senior deputy governor of Indonesia’s central bank. The Indonesian currency has been one of the most severely affected by the global turmoil, falling to lows not seen since the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98.

In a somewhat pointed criticism, not usual in central banking circles, he said: “We think US monetary policymakers have got confused about what to do. The situation has created the turmoil.”

The Fed, he advised, should make a decision and then indicate to the markets that it will make one or two increases and then stop.

His views have been echoed by Peru’s central bank governor, Julio Velarde, who said most emerging markets wanted the Fed to raise rates as soon as possible. “The uncertainty about when the Fed will hike will happen is causing more damage than the Fed hike will itself.”

However some economic commentators have warned that the underlying fragility of the world economy makes a rate rise too dangerous at this point. According to Financial Times economic commentator Martin Wolf, a necessary condition for an increase is the confidence that it will not be needed to be reversed in the near future. “But it is impossible at present to have such confidence,” he wrote Wednesday.

Writing in the same newspaper, former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers warned that what he called conventional wisdom “underestimates the risks in the current moment.” Pointing to the fallout from the Russian default of 1998, the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 and US subprime lending, he said history taught that “financial interconnections are pervasive and not apparent until it’s too late.”

He pointed to a number of risks, including capital flight from China which could be larger than experienced by “any economy in history,” decelerating productivity growth in the US, tightening liquidity conditions in a number of markets, and the growing importance of what he called “positive feedback” trading strategies where investors sell when prices go down.

If “some portion of these fears are warranted,” he continued, “and the Fed tips toward tightening, its risks a catastrophic error.”

While the US economy has been referred to as a “bright spot” in the global economy, it is here that some of the biggest risks may be concentrated.

With investment returns in the real economy having failed to recover after the financial crisis, profits are being accumulated by borrowing money at ultra-low rates in order to finance mergers and acquisitions and share buybacks. Leveraging—the use of debt—facilitates high returns on equity so long as interest rates do not rise. But even a small increase can throw the whole process in reverse.

According to a report in the Financial Times this week, a “turning point looms” for what it called the “US debt binge.” The newspaper said energy companies that have used cheap financing but which now face the impact of falling prices could start to default. The report cited Barclays strategist Eric Gross, who noted that the problem for low-rated energy companies was not whether they paid interest at 7 or 9 percent, but whether “they can get financing at all.”

The pharmaceutical and health care industry, which has seen a series of deals financed by debt, could also be hit if rates rise.

Overall, according to figures from Bank of America Merill Lynch, the debt burden of US high-grade companies is at its highest level since 2002, and even when sectors hard hit by falling commodity prices are excluded, leverage is now at the levels reached in 2008.

These developments make clear that, seven years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, none of the measures taken by governments and central banks in response to the crisis have restored any degree of stability to the global economy. Instead, they have vastly enriched the financial oligarchy at the expense of the population, while setting the stage for a financial panic on the scale of, or even greater than, that of 2008.",finance,1441970564

Long story short: In June 2014 I got a new job(Job B) that paid 25% more than my last job(Jab A). Then in October 2014 that job got outsourced but the outsourcing company liked me and offered me a job(Job C) making close to 75% more thatn what I was making at my previous job(job A). So my first year making this much money I splurged A LOT. To the tune of $12k. I worked hard these past 5 years so I wanted treat myself. 

Here's what I spent the money on(Ballpark estimates) 

$1500- Watercooled gaming PC

$500  - FreeNAS machine

$500  - PS4 and games

$500  - Wii U and games

$800  - 3DS and games. it was actually 3 different 3DS systems which were $470

$600   - Funko Pops

$1500 - Phones( I had to get a one replacement because 1 of the phones broke) Otherwise this would have been closer to $1000

$500   - DSLR

$1000 - Furniture that were optional and not NEEDED but I wanted

$1200 - 1/2 grass fed Cow

$500   - Anime boston

$1500 - baby stuff

$1500 - presents, birthdays and misc

Aside from the cow I don't see anything on this list that I'll likely get again.
I'm going to get modest with presents and birthdays. I'll probably skip anime boston this year or if I go I'll control myself with the spending.
Realistically speaking I don't think I'll be saving all $12k but $8-10k should be realistic.
What I should do with that money is where I need help.
My credit is not great so I would like repair and make it better. I'm at about 650 ish credit score and I'd like to be at 750.

I have about $32k in student loans that I'm paying back on time every month and reflects good on my credit
I just financed a car for $24k. like 2 weeks ago. 5.09% interest which is not great but it's not bad. I can live with it.
I paid off my previous car this year but I did miss some payments during the finance term and I'm wondering if there's anyway I get this removed from my credit report. Like as an act of good will or something.
I have a private student loan that I been avoiding. but I'm pretty sure it's affecting my credit score badly. Like I graduated college in 2011 and I have just not been picking up their calls which is dumb I know.
I have an upcoming court date with BoA about a CC that was closed a long time ago so I'm not sure it still shows up on my credit report but I think the firm representing them keeps pulling up my credit and that might be affecting it badly.

I think there's 2 other misc things on my credit that are fairly cheap to pay and have removed from my credit report I hope. 1 is Early Termination FEE from verizon and I forget what the other one was but the 2 are about $400 together so easy enough to take care off.
I only have 1 line of Credit and that's with Amazon. It's a very high interest rate card but I only use it with the special financing option which doesn't charge interest. IF paid off in a year ($500+) or 6 months ($150)
No savings. Planning on getting on my company's 401k during open enrollment. But no other plans as far savings and other types of accounts that helps me get more money

So PF gurus what do you think the best course of action should be for me. Please guide me because I'm terrible with money and never realized how important credit was in this country.

Thanks in advanced.

personalfinance,Refinancing auto loan because I am unsatisfied with the lender,"So I have kind of a silly question. A few months ago I bought a car and took out an auto loan for a decent interest rate. The loan was originally through Ally bank, but then soon after the purchase Ally transfered it to a different small bank that I had never heard of. Same interest rate and everything, just a different bank.

This bank is awful. I do all my banking online and my biggest complaint is their website. You can not create an account with them like a normal bank. Each time I submit a payment I have to fill out some sketchy form on their late 90's era website and it has no confirmation or email notification system. I get no proof that I paid on time other than seeing the amount come out of my checking account. I've also tried calling them a few times with questions about how to get my statements, and have been stuck on hold for long periods of time, and been disconnected randomly, or sent through phone trees that hang up on me if I don't select the right option fast enough.

This is very much a ""first world problem"" so nothing super critical, so I was wondering if this reason alone was enough to refinance with another bank as long as I could refinance to the same or a better interest rate. My credit is decent, nothing amazing since I'm still pretty young, but not bad at all for my age.

So tl:Dr questions: Would it be an awful idea to refinance? If I did refinance with a different bank, would it be likely to have my loan transferred to a crappy bank again?

personalfinance,Going from 10 an hour to 17. Looking for some advice on my current financial plan and debt repayment system.,"Hello PF!

So as the title says I will soon be going from making 10 an hour, and a weekly paycheck, to 17.18 an hour with a bi-weekly paycheck. This will be the highest pay I've ever made. With that I thought maybe I should really start focusing on becoming financially fit and paying off al debts.

What I make in a typical week is anywhere from 191.00 to 210.00 so going with the average lets say 600.00 a month right now. ( I've only worked at my current job 3 weeks and am leaving in 2 for new one) 

Next job: 17.18 an hour with a 37.50 hour work week, overtime allowed and double pay for any small holidays. 63.70 bi-weekly to the insurance plan. I'm roughly guessing, though not planning, on making about 990.00-1,010ish in take home every two weeks for a monthly of maybe 2000.00 if I am lucky.  

My current debts are as follows: 

**4,900 on a Credit card that Caps out at 5,000** I pay a 0.1 interest rate on it so suggested repayment is typically 5-10 dollars a month. I tend to pay 20-50 depending on what is left over after my weekly budgeting. 

**500.00 to SO for missed rent.** I was out of work and he paid for my half of the rent. I save about 15-30 a paycheck, so far twice, and then intend to pay the rest off with my first paycheck from next job. 

**30,000.00in school loans. 200.00 a month in interest.** The state thankfully decided that I am too poor to have a monthly balance so as long as I pay something I am ok. I obviously want to jump on this one in a big way. 

Other debts include: 

**650.00 for rent and utilities a month.** 

** 40.00 for Eating out.** It is not often that I pay, my SO typically takes over there as he makes more than me, but I typically round it to 40 a week including some groceries. 

I live in a city where public transportation is the main source of commuting so I do not own a car so no insurance, gas, etc. I am also still currently on my mothers insurance plan, till my new job, and cell phone plan as well. 

**30.00 entertainment and clothing allowance** I typically thrift for my clothing so I can keep it low by going to Buffalo Exchange type places. 

**My Main Goals:**  

**Pay off SO**. - Easy one I feel. 

**Pay off Credit Card no later than February**.

**Start focusing on Student Loans.** That interest scares the shit out of me and my SO. 

**Start a Savings Fund/Emergency Fund**. I am 23 and would like to have something saved up. 

I'm really looking for any general advice you may have on how to make the most out of this current pay that I am making and then my future pay. 

Thank you for reading!

I put in 6% to get the max match of 3% from my company. My wife puts in 5% to get the max match of 2.5% from her company. Once more student loan debt is paid off I plan to max a Roth IRA each year. Still don't know a whole lot about them but will research more when the time comes.



**Summary**



What am I doing right? What am I doing wrong? Obviously student loan debt is killing us but I'm trying to pay way more than the minimum to get rid of those suckers. I don't pay much over minimum on my car or mortgage because the interest rates are much lower than the student loans (3.25% and 3.875% respectively).



I'm sure some of the budgets could be made smaller (like the Misc one) but I still want to have a little fun and spend *some* of my money. Any and all help/criticism is welcomed and appreciated.

personalfinance,Will I be able to get a cashier's check easily in this situation?,"Background information: 

I am going to college soon, and have received some financial aid(1/2 the total cost of my tuition this year) but still need to pay about $5,000 by next Tuesday for school. I also have a $2,000 independent scholarship that I received in the mail two weeks ago. 

I generally assumed that my mom would help pay this bill, and she did too. She attended several workshops during my orientation days and visiting days regarding financial aid, so I assumed that she knew deadlines. 

I started to discuss these with her last night, and she dropped a bombshell - she didn't know deadlines, and was waiting for me to notify her. I had been talking to her about paying for school for the past few days, and I assumed she knew things. She did not go to college the way I am. 

Her money is stored in an online bank that takes days to transfer. Apparently it gives her a high interest rate, but she may not be able to take money out in time. She has neglected(and sometimes refused) to give me any information regarding her financial situation throughout my entire life, so I was just forced to assume hers was like mine - her money was readily available in a savings account linked to a major bank that had local branches. 

I, however, received an [non-disclosed] amount of money from a cooky relative this year that I deposited in my Chase account that will more than cover the $3000 I will owe on top of the $2000 check I plan to give them Monday in person. 

I have had this chase account for years. I have never withdrawn any money from it, only deposited. I have a legitimate California ID, my account number, and everything I would need to prove that I am the owner of the account. 

If I were to go in tomorrow or Monday, would I be able to acquire a cashiers check totaling about $3,000 that I could take to my school and pay them with on the same day?",finance,1441988655

My dad was put into a nursing home a few months ago until I could come down to bring him home and take care of him, which I am now doing. That means I'm not working, have a small amount of savings and his SS to keep the house running, us fed, and bills paid...

Well I started going through the bills and discovered he has about 25 grand in credit card debt that has defaulted and now the treasury, JP Morgan Chase, AmEx, etc are calling and sending notices. As well, my student loans haven't been paid for at least 6 month, so I quickly made a payment and have taken over paying this. 

I'm mostly concerned with how to handle the 25 grand in CC debt, especially given that I don't know how much longer he'll be around. Any advice is incredibly appreciative, Social Security barely covers his expenses and my savings will only cover me for a 2-3 months.

personalfinance,Extra Money: Tough Decisions,"Hello, r/personalfinance community. This is my first post, so please forgive me for any breach of formalities you may be accustomed to reading in these posts. Anyways...long story short, I'm an ROTC cadet. My college gives me scholarships and grants. I have student loans for three semesters. However, my tuition is paid for now, I receive some stipend money, and books are paid for as well.

Recently, I dsicovered an overbalance of $11,200 on my account at the uni. I'm wondering what to do with it? Should I pay off loans, stash it in a savings account, invest it?

here are some stats:

Monthly income: $500 (tax free because Army)
$600 per semester (for books; I get to keep it though, because my grandparents are generous and buy my books for me)
$11,200 in overbalance
$2,000 savings account
$700 in checkings account (average balance of $450)

Expenses: 
$150 a month for rent (it's cheap, because my aunt and uncle are very generous)
$50 for gas
$50 for leisure activities
 I have no personal loans--only Federal subsidized loans. 

Thanks for the help, guys and gals!

Edit 1: The overbalance was the result of scholarships the school ""forgot"" to pay me, because they somehow missed my FAFSA submission last year. I've spoken with Financial Services numerous times and have recorded guarantees that it's mine.",finance,1441992023
personalfinance,Multiple credit cards with unaffordable monthly payments,"Nearly a year ago, I moved across the country from New York to Arizona without having a job lined up beforehand; long-story short, I was able to find a full-time job (benefits, 401K, etc) with the city's community hospital. However, the job pays at an entry-level rate ($10.00 hourly) and after taxes/insurance, I'm barely clearly $1,000 monthly. That said, this does cover my monthly rent, cell phone, Internet, and all other menial expenses. 

With an MPA, I'm overqualified for the position I'm in, but will stay here as my job search continues. I bring this up because I owe (before interest) roughly $250,000 in federal student loans. I've deferred payment on them through the end of 2015, and will likely do the same in 2016; when my income level rises, I'll likely enter into one of the PSLF programs. That is not my immediate concern. 

What is most pressing is my credit card debt. Because I wanted to retain my liquid assets (roughly $12,000 before I moved here, and now about $4,000 remains), I opened multiple credit card accounts (irresponsible in retrospect) and now owe at least $10,000 spread out over multiple cards. 

At the age of 28, not all is lost. I don't intend to make this same mistake again once I figure a way out of it. I did assume-incorrectly-that by this point I would have found a higher-paying job, but this is not the case. 

I've read the sidebar, the Wiki, with a focus on credit cards and managing debt. I am wondering, though...

1) Would it be easier to pick one company, like Citi, roll over all of my debt onto one card (assuming this is an option) and then try to reduce the monthly payments into something more affordable for the time being? 

2) Should I turn to a debt-management company and try to consolidate that way? 

3) Should I consider a private loan via the local credit union, pay off the cards, and then pay back the bank? 

I haven't pursued any of these three options yet, but would like to address this as soon as possible. Obviously I'm open to alternatives. Having lurked here for some time, this is a really great community, and I do appreciate any insights you may have for me. 

My 30s and 40s will be handled much differently. Life lessons, I suppose. Thanks, everyone.",finance,1441992044
personalfinance,Credit card payoff strategy question,"Hi guys. I'm one of those idiots who ignored the dangers of credit cards. I have mostly learned the errors of my ways, and now only charge things that were highly unexpected (emergency) or I pay some of my bills with a rewards card and immediately then pay it back from checking. 

While I have reformed my ways, I still have what feels like a mountain left in front of me. Mainly because of the interest rates. One or two cards have 9-10% interest but the rest are in the 22% range. I've had a lot of OT at work lately, and I am proud to say that in the last month or two, a $1300 balance is now $300, and a $500 balance is now also $300, and both of those accounts will be paid off soon. They were both &gt; 20% and since they are both almost paid off I won't list them below.

 However I still have a card with $4000 ($6k limit), a card with $1900 ($2k limit) and two cards with $1400 balances ($1500) limits. Then also a card with $700 balance ($1k limit).

 But that last one I'm not too worried about right now, it's low interest and I only have about $5 worth of financing charges each month. I just pay $10-15 over the min each month and it's been moving on down. I also haven't focused on that $1900 balance yet either because it's also fairly low interest compared to the rest.

My main mountain is that $4k, and the two $1500 ones. The 4k is ""high"" utilization"" but not close to maxed. The other two are almost maxed obviously. The biggest hurdle to paying these things down is that damn interest rate. The 4k card has a min payment of around $125 but every month around $75 in finance charges come back, for example. 

My credit score is around 650. I have great payment history (missed 1-2 in 2010 but otherwise 100%) and according to credit karma my largest detractor is high utilization. So finally, the point of my question. I would like to try to open a new card with a 0% introduction period to defer some interest (even if I can't move all my debt to it). However right now, due to high utilization, chances of approval seem unlikely. So once I pay off these first two cards I mentioned, should I either A: attack one card religiously, or B: try and get the utilization of all cards down some in effort to get a more favorable card to transfer to (or a good rate on a personal loan)? My overtime is likely to slow down or be gone in the next month, so the rate I can pay them down will be slowing down a lot also, to just modest sums above minimum payment. So I'm trying to dump what I can into them now, but just not sure the best way to do it, although with reduced/normal payments coming back again sometime soon, some deferred interest would really be nice.",finance,1441993761

personalfinance,"Unique situation - illiquid assets, reduced income, and lots of debt","I'm in a fairly unique position I think. The TL;DR is I'm getting less take home. All my savings numbers below are rough estimates - I was pretty irresponsible and didn't bother really tracking spending/saving.

I'm relatively young (24). I changed jobs. Previously, I was taking home around 190 before taxes, now I take back 150 before taxes (but am getting 250 in equity). I can't touch the equity for a while, so consider that a longterm investment.

To be honest with myself, I was pretty bad with money. I was at my previous job for just about a year, and saved around 50k in my bank account, +18 in my 401k (company put in 9 to match, so 27 total), 5.5 in my Roth. I used my saved money to pay off one of my student loans (40 @ 3.5%).

That's not bad, but I could have definitely done better. I'm pretty far in debt still. I financed a car for 30 @ 2% (monthly payments are 600). I still have outstanding student loan debt, 80 @ 2.5%. Both are fairly low interest rates.

My monthly expenses are 1550 to loans, 1500 to rent (SF :/), and 700 to my car. Previously I think I was spending around 2k a month on other things, like traveling/eating out/things I didn't really need.

I plan on cutting back my personal spending to around 1500/month, which ballparking numbers should give me around 2k/month in savings (after maxing out 401k/Roth IRA), which I will probably use at the end of the year to pay off more of my loans.

personalfinance,"I got screwed over by a car dealership, I need advice on how to save my ass","Two weeks ago I had a beater of a car that I had been babying along for months. Repair bills were piling up, one thing would get fixed, something else would go wrong. I was upside down on the loan, had been making all my payments on time but still owed around $4500 on it.      
 
    Que monday Aug. 31. I was taking my son and daughter for a final fun day before school started. My car started chugging and stalling. This is the second time in 4 weeks that this same problem has happened. It's coded as a cylinder 3 misfire. I called my mechanic who had fixed this last time, and he told me to bring it in. 

    On my way to him I thought I would just stop at a dealership and see what I could do. I was so fed up, I'm a single mom, trying to start a business, in a town with no family, and this thing was nickle and dimeing me to death.  Now,  my credit is less than desireable. I have one repo 2 1/2 years ago. I learned my lesson and have not been late on this car. 

    We go in, sit down, I fill out the paperwork to ""see what they can do for me"". The financer comes back asking if I have a co signer. Yes, my parents would, but I'd like to do this on my own. He suggests that we try with them.My parents were on their way up to help me with my car situation, and my mom said it was fine. So we do. After 5 minutes he comes back days we can get you a car. He brings the car up. It's brand new, GREAT warranty, no more headaches. 

Here's where this all goes south, once my parents get there he asks (with my mom as a witness) if I can ""just surrender my car? Because it's going to add $100 onto my payments."" I ask ""is that basicly another repo then?"" to which he responds ""one repo or two doesn't matter"" shoulder shrug nonchalant like eh whatever. I believe him he does this for a living right?     Then he asks if we can just ""put the loan in my mom's name for right now, the interest rate will be much lower"", ergo lower payments for me. Ok I ask if I can go on it soon he says ""yes,you write the checks showing you are paying the loan, and in 6 months we'll add you on."" Great, works for me. 

   Other people walk in but a car and leave and were there for almost 6 hrs. Once the financing is done we go in to sign the papers,  and leave with added on $2500 extended warranty and a $800 coating to protect the interior and exterior. 

    The next day I go and surrender my old car. The dealership calls wondering why? I've been making my payments and am close to having it payed off. Over the 2 1/2 years I have worked closely with the manager of the other dealership, I go in and tell him all the problems. It needs a new engine, brakes, brake lines from front to back, transmition, and exhaust, and I can't afford it anymore. He asks me what I am going to do with the old car. I tell him that the other dealership told me to surrender it, that ""one repo or two doesn't matter"", and I would be added to the new loan in 6 months.  He  tells me there is no way I am going to be added to the loan, that they interfered with a contract and that is illegal, and they CANNOT make any statements on what will positively or negatively affect my credit. He also said that they could have lowered the MSRP,  not added the other things on, and rolled my car into this. That a new car can take even $3500, and you would only owe $1000. He then told me what's going to happen: that they will sell the car at auction, whatever is left they will take me to court for and garnish my wages 20% every two weeks until it's paid off. Currently, he is trying to talk to the loan committee about reducing my interest to 0%, I pay what I can until tax time and then pay it off, but it's not a guarantee that they'll even approve that. 

    When my parents called the bank the loan is through they said that my mom and only my mom would be on this loan. The (new car)dealership financier is now denying that he said anything about surrendering my car, the casual statement about the repos', or about adding me to the loan. 

    I do not have the money to pay off my old car. My parents do not need, or want this car.   I've been working so hard at rebuilding my credit.  I don't know what to do. Any advise would be helpful. Sorry about the wall of text. Thank you in advance.

personalfinance,looking for some encouragement from all of you smart and savvy people at /pf!,"I recently purchased a car, about a month ago, and I think I'm doing ok. I'm unfortunately one of those people that have serious buyer's remorse whether it be from an unnecessary pair of jeans to a car that may or may not be needed. Just to give the essentials needed for the advice, 

I have about a $50k salary with yearly bonus, and expecting a raise later this year. 
I have about $7k in CC debt at a 0% APR for 16 months due to a recent balance transfer (my cc of 10 years offered me the deal and the transfer fee was about 2 months of what my interest would have been).
Rent is ~$1050 a month, (I live in DC and have 2 other roommates and we all pay the same amount) 
Bills: the only consistent set amount is typically my netflix and verizon accounts which is around $140 a month. 
Food and gas typically fluctuate depending on my activity. 

I just purchased a new car (got extended mechanical warranty and maintenance) for about $24k, I qualified for a 1.9% over 5 years, but chose a 2.9% over 6 since the payment was less. I plan on paying extra every month and hopefully plan to be paid off after about 3-4 years. 

I had an 06 Jeep Grand Cherokee previously, but that thing was having a lot of issues, it was on its 2nd engine and a body showed me there was a hole in the engine somewhere since every couple of months, the oil was completely empty and the engine bay was drenched in oil, that and when ever I used the A/C it would cause the dashboard to light up like a Xmas tree, it was weird. so the cost of repair made me feel like getting a new car would be better. Especially since I'm pretty sure it wouldn't pass an emissions test and that would be another issue. I got $5k for it as a trade in when I got my new vhc. 

Was I stupid in getting the new vehicle? or choosing the higher interest rate? I've never really made these big decisions before, but the body shop manager (who is also a good friend of mine) said it was probably smarter to get a new, reliable car since Jeeps were notorious for their issues.

Then I have my HESAA/ NJ Class loans. I am listed as the borrower. 3 loans, 6.25% interest rate, $235/month minimum.

I could take a job at a critical access hospital and have a large portion of my ""eligible"" school debt paid for (60% for 2 years, another 20% for an additional year), however this would come with a substantial pay cut at about $80k/year, and I think this may only work for the federal loans.

I recently started going to the school of my dreams, I finally feel like I am in a place where I can fit in. In order to stay at this school, I need to figure out my financial aid options. At my old school, I was able to say that my dad had filed his taxes because they were similar to the year before, and my school let it slide, no big deal (he doesn't file them until October for some reason). 

Now that I am at this new school, I need my FAFSA to go through, but it will not because he hasn't filed his taxes yet. I asked him if he would, and he said no. I also asked if he would cosign with me on a ParentPlus loan, but he will not do that either as he doesn't want any debt in his name. This is understandable, but at the same time, I;m lvid; we talked about this before, so he knew I would have to apply for this loan and he knew that he would have to cosign.

I spoke to my financial aid officer, and he said I can;t even get Pel grant, Cal grant, Stafford loans, or the ParentPlus loan because my dad has not filed his taxes yet. My only option now is to take out a $16,000 loan from Sallie Mae (this is the only option that I can see that the moment).

Right now I make a little over $1,000. I have rent which is $1000 (I know, this is very high especially for my income, but I was told my federal aid would help take care of that because I can file this under as living expenses, and living expenses are included as an average number in the tuition (I hope that made sense). I also have bills every other month that amount to ~$300 dollars (again, I understand that this is so stupid, but my mom is able to send me money for this amount). I live in a studio, and it's very small, so I will not be able to share the space with anyone to make rent cheaper for myself. I might be able to find another place to live at, but I would need to get a sub lease in order and I don't even know if I would get my $2000 deposit back or if my landlord even allows that.

I am wondering if there are any other options here... While I could move back home, I would be absolutely devastated, and to me, this is not really an option (this option would only happen if I had to quit school and I wasn't able to make it by saving up money and getting another job). Maybe I'm really emotional right now, but I am so bent on not failing, and I don't know what to do. 

TLDR My dad hasn't filed his taxes yet and he wont until October, so I cannot get any federal student aid (ParentPlus, which he wont even cosign for, Stafford, or any grants from the government).

I also have the following student loans. They're grouped together by the owner of the loans, and in all cases I'm using a blended rate since they're mostly made up of smaller loans with varying interest rates. The payment I listed is the minimum payment.

$15,535 at 6.41%. My payment is $414. 3.4 years left of payments at this rate. This is a parent plus loan I'm paying for my mom and is one of the biggest causes of financial stress for me.

personalfinance,Is Refinancing Student Loans Worth the hassle and credit pull?,"I am curious if people have advice about refinancing student loans. I am having trouble finding a private student loan refinance provider that gives real rate quotes without hard pulls or a lot of hoops to jump through.

Currently, my wife has about $22,000 of student loan debt, all federal loans. About $6000 of that is unsubsidized loans with a rate of 6.55%. The other $16,000 is subsidized loans at 3.5%, so we are not exactly rushing to refinance or pay those off. Our current plan is to pay about $500/month towards the high interest loans and minimum on the other loans, but we were reflecting that if the interest rate were lowered more of that money would be going towards principal. Is it reasonable to try to pursue refinancing? Her credit score is in the 730-750 range. I suppose I am wondering if it is possible to get a rate that is better enough to make it worth the hassle. Currently I do not have any student loans but that is about to change in a big way (graduate school).

Recap and other Relevant info:

* Household income: $45,000
* Emergency Fund: 3 comfortable months' expenses
* Credit score: ~740
* Credit Card Debt: $0
* Student Loans: ~$6,000 @ 6.55%
                         ~$16,000 @ 3.5%
* Mortgage: $98,000 @ 3.85%

I'm fairly stupid and waste a lot of money .

I've lost all my friends and most of my family due to various reasons relates to my injury such as pain meds and mood swings and paranoia. 

Ive never had THINGS in my life.  I'm fairly poor. And I really want to start to live better eat better and travel and invest. I'm the kind of guy who would help others in need. For now I want to help myself. 

So what should I do? 

I earn 2.5k/month after taxes from a job I do at home now. Which works out great... 

And I get 2k from the settlement. 

My only expense is my rent which is 1100/month. 

I eat out alot. That's where I spend most money. Just out of boredom though and could easily eat in if I had a reason to save. 

I really want to start investing online. It seems fun. And could be lucrative. I know nothing about it but I bet alot on bet365 so j assume it's kinda the same thing, the stock market right?

Back when it was ING, and I was mostly broke, working retail, the interest was really good. Now, of course, that I'm making more money in a different job, the interest has just plummeted from the 1% and above I was enjoying to 0.75%.  I'm considering switching to Ally since they're still offering close to 1% interest.  What do I have to do to move that money since Ally doesn't have a physical location I can walk into? My balance is enough for a downpayment on a house, so it's quite a bit. Would I raise some eyebrows at Ally (and possibly the FBI?) if I could transfer the entire amount over in one go, or would I have to transfer it in smaller amounts?

As for the comment about the FBI, the money was made legally. I just don't want them going ""Huh, Darcerin sure is moving a lot of money...let's take a look!""

personalfinance,Is a personal loan with Upstart a good option for me?,"Through a combination of irresponsible money management and unfortunate necessity, I am currently carrying about $8000 in credit card debt. This is between 4 credit cards that my wife and I have. Most of the cards started at a promotional 0% APR but now interest has kicked kick in between 19.99% to 21.99%. I have learned my lesson and do not use credit cards AT ALL. My sole focus is to pay these down immediately. I am working 5 or 6 twelve hour shifts a week to get out of this. 

Ideally, I could open up a card with a 0% APR offer on balance transfers like Chase Slate or Citi Simplicity and transfer the debt to those cards to avoid paying interest. However, in the case that I do not receive a sufficient credit line to cover all of the debt via balance transfer, would it be a good idea to take out an Upstart loan to at least consolidate the debt and reduce my interest rate? Looks like I can take a loan around 12% APR from Upstart to pay off all of the debt. Much better than the current average around 21% APR on my credit cards. Is this a good option? 



Please do not offer advice regarding that the real problem is my credit card use and insinuate that I will just rack up this credit card debt again if I pay it off with an Upstart loan. I've jumped that hurdle, haven't touched a credit card in months. I hate credit card debt and refuse to go down this path again.

personalfinance,"Juggling options for paying for college, and could use some help!","Hi /r/personalfinance.

I find myself in a pretty weird financial position as I enter my third year of college in a large public school. This year my financial aid has been cut by about 1/3 and I need to find the smartest way to pay for my living expenses. There is more information on my (rather complex) situation below. I'd really appreciate any advice.

For a while during high school my family relied on food stamps, and things were especially hard after my dad's expensive surgery left him unable to work. Five years ago my grandmother died and left a significant portion of her stock portfolio (now ~$400k) to my mom. My family has been more or less living off of the dividends from that stock portfolio since (~$10k/year). Under these conditions, I qualify for financial aid - my family falls under the threshold where the school will provide a way to pay for the entire cost of attendance (estimated by the school at ~30k/year, including tuition, room and board, books).

In my first year, I lived in the on-campus dorms, where the cost of attendance is expected to be a bit higher, and accepted ~$26k in scholarship money, which is not expected to be paid back. Last year I accepted ~$21k in scholarship money, since I was living off campus where the CoL is lower. Since my financial situation has not changed much in the last year, I expected that figure to be similar this year, but it is only ~$14k, about 2/3 of what I was expecting.

In previous years I didn’t take any of the student loans that were offered to me, but I might have to this year in order to pay for food, housing, and books, since the tuition alone is around $14k. I was offered these loans :

Federal Perkins Loan - $900/year
&gt;The loan interest rate is fixed at 5 percent. Loan repayment and interest accrual begin nine months after graduation or less than half-time enrollment.

Direct Subsidized Loan - $5,500/year
&gt;The student does not have to make payments while enrolled at least half-time and for 6 months after graduation or dropping below half-time. Loan interest starts accruing at graduation… Interest rate is [fixed at] 4.29% for loans with first disbursement on/after July 1, 2015 until June 30, 2016. (need-based)

Direct Unsubsidized Loan - $2,000/year
&gt;The borrower (student) does not have to make principal payments while enrolled at least half-time or for 6 months after graduation. The borrower is responsible for all interest that accrues from the date of disbursement. 4.29% for loans with first disbursement between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016. (non-need-based)

Direct Parent Plus Loan - $7,197/year
&gt;This is a non-need based, fixed interest rate loan awarded to parents of dependent undergraduate students. These loans are credit based and go into repayment within 60 days after the final disbursement. Borrower (parent) can request that the loan payment be deferred until the student graduates (or drops below half-time enrollment).Interest rate is 6.84% for loans disbursed between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016.

I have emailed the financial aid office to try to figure out why my aid has been so significantly reduced, but in the meantime, I need to make up a plan for how to pay for school. I have decided to not to accept this aid offer until I hear back from the school and decide whether or not I'll need to take advantage of the loans they offered.

My grandma also set up a CollegeAmerica 529 savings plan for me years ago. In 2012, it had a value of ~$74k. Since the savings plan is not yet in my name, I am not required to report it on FAFSA or any other aid documents, but this is a way that I may be able to pay for student loans, pay for grad school, or withdraw it with the 10% capital gains tax (for non-school related withdrawals) and put it into investments and savings. I don’t think I can draw from these funds while receiving financial aid, though - to draw from them now would basically mean wasting this money.

I want to make a wise decision regarding how I deal with all of this, and I could really use your help! Thanks!",finance,1442035291
personalfinance,Accessing money from distant banks,"Hi PF,

I'm establishing myself for the third time in recent history and, as a result, hold two checking accounts in two different corners of the country, both area-local credit unions -- one I receive my paycheck into and access via ATM and another kind-of secondary I hold paper checks for (and maybe have an ATM card around).

I recently set out to buy a car, but ended up finishing the agreement much faster than I'd anticipated. I initiated an online transfer to the paper check account for a large amount a few days earlier, and it looks like it straddles my money so that neither account holds the amount due for the car until it clears and that that will happen one or two days late (although, not counting the transfer in-limbo, the two together do add to that amount).

To complicate things a bit further, the dealer specifically requested a cashier's check. Both banks are many hours away and I can't find any literature on either of their websites about federated bank networks or how to otherwise secure such an instrument in my circumstance. I can ask for more time and if, in fact, a personal check is an option, but I feel like I'm at risk of losing the deal (and my deposit -- charged via credit?) for the mistakes of (1) not opening a more local account and (2) making a purchase such a large portion of my free cash.

Are there options I'm not considering here? Am I right to believe that a bank will laugh me out of the building if I ask for the order and to fund it from two ACH transfers? I also have a credit card with a limit a bit above the value of the car. I will call both banks tomorrow and think of good questions to ask, but I wanted to get a second opinion from you.

**EDIT**, in case anyone else comes along to this thread.

My problem was solved by utilizing a sister credit union that belonged to the same bank network (CO-OP, pretty prolific). They were able to provide me to with a cashier's check (free, I'm pretty sure) addressed to me, which I was able to endorse over to another party.",finance,1442039144
personalfinance,First time home buyers....help me not ruin everything.,"My wife and I currently have a home under contract, and we're in the period of attorney review. I've been financially stable and have diligently saved for the past 5 years, and I think it's put us in a pretty good position to buy a home. We are tired of pouring money into rent, and we believe we found the right place for us after a year of looking, at a price we think we can afford.


I'm 28 years old with 45K in savings for a down payment. We have 10k in emergency savings. I make a 85k salary, and my wife makes approximately 30k (she makes commission, so it fluctuates) which brings us to 115k annually, with a monthly take home of approximately $7,000. I'm fortunate enough to have no debts, but my wife is 70k in the hole with student loans. We are paying all the minimums right now which comes out to $600 a month, and putting what we can spare into the loan with the highest interest rate - all while saving 10% of our take home income and putting 6% for the maximum company match into my 401K. No credit card debt, no car payments. Our rent is currently $1,800. 


The home we are considering costs $270,000.  We are planning to do 10% down, so after closing costs and perhaps a single premium PMI payment up front (is this recommended?) - we'd have some cash liquid to do some much needed updates to the kitchen, and other smaller projects around the house.

A $270,000 home - 10% down payment with a 30 year fixed loan. 4.25% interest. This puts us at an estimate $1,700 monthly payment (mortgage + taxes + home insurance + pmi).

So I ran the numbers, and we do pass the [28/36 rule.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/twenty-eight-thirty-six-rule.asp)
 
$1,700 home payment  / $7,000 monthly income  = 24%

$1,700 + $600(debt) / $7,000 monthly income = 32%



We live in a major US city, and have done TONS of shopping - so we know this home is coming at a good value, and think it is a sound investment for both our financial future and happiness.

Are the numbers adding up here? I've been doing my research, but I just want to make sure this all makes sense and I'm not missing anything. Would a single up front PMI payment be recommended if we can afford it?

economy,What am I missing? Yellen's labor market dashboard is still behind on 6 out of 9 measures.,"I fully expect the Fed to raise rates next week though I'm puzzled by the seeming inevitability of the decision. The labor market dashboard that Yellen suggested was important in indicating when a hike would occur is still behind on 6 out of 9 measures. It's here:

http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-yellens-labor-market-dashboard/

Both actual inflation and inflation expectations remain anchored (in fact actual inflation is well below target of 2%). The dollar is already quite strong (particularly after the Chinese devaluation). Markets are volatile and EMs are in a world of hurt. Wages remain stubbornly stuck in neutral and have been for a very long time. There isn't even a hint of general wage increase pressure.

In this context I'm puzzled why the Fed would raise now when the risk of triggering a recession at this stage of the ""recovery"" is enormous. But the risk of inflation seems small and quite remote. In that context it is rational for people to flee the stock market and ""wait it out"" which, in and of itself, could help bring on slower growth or even a recession.

If they raise now they will be getting out in front of wage pressure that doesn't exist and inflation that doesn't exist. And they'll be doing it at a time when almost all of our trade partners are actively devaluing their currency.

To be clear I'm not arguing we should restart QE but it seems foolish to tighten when the US dollar is already so strong that it's damaging the competitiveness of American goods abroad. In particular it seems even more foolish to tighten when inflation and inflation expectations are anchored and the labor market is still behind on 6 out of the 9 measures that the Fed themselves said were important indicators of labor market health.",finance,1442070802

I want to do this because it's easy to forget. It's easy to become so focused in the here and now that we forget the lessons of our history. I also want to do this to highlight the fact that we are begininning to correct those mistakes. It may not seem like it, but we've come a long way in the last seven years. It's not easy to get back on the right path after having our course so dramatically altered, but we *are* starting to move back in the right direction. But we can't get impatient, we can't start fighting amonst ourselves - because we all want the same things. We need to stay united.

So. September 11th, 2001. We all remember it, but we may not all remember how it changed this country. In the weeks and months (even years, for some) that followed, it was a time of unprecedented fear and anger, and rightfully so. But our government exploited that fear and anger from one of the worst tragedies in our nation's history to set us on a course that would cause irreparable damage to America and leave the world a more dangerous and insecure place. 

As an immediate response, the U.S. Congress, led by a Republican majority in both Houses, but with [near](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/09/the-vindication-of-barbara-lee/380084/) unanimous support from Democrats, passed the [Authorization for Use of Military Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists) on 9/14. With those 60 words, George W. Bush was granted the largest expansion of executive branch war powers since LBJ in the Vietnam era. Just 45 days later, Congress, pressured by the administration, passed the infamous [USA/PATRIOT Act](https://www.aclu.org/surveillance-under-usa-patriot-act), again with [almost](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/07/russ-feingold-patriot-act-speech_n_3402878.html) no dissenting voices. Not long after, the president famously declared to the world, [“You are either with us or against us”](http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/11/06/ret.bush.coalition/index.html). With every new power granted to him by terrified and bloodthirsty Congress, and an unquestioning and complicit media, the president and the people who advised him felt ever more emboldened, that this ""War on Terror"" was their *right*, their [crusade](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/opinion/how-a-war-became-a-crusade.html) (he [literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TRVcnX8Vsw) called it that). He promised he would stay focused on the war against the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and wouldn't get distracted. But less than two years later, we were steadily being [sold lies](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/12/leadup-iraq-war-timeline)  about WMDs in Iraq, being told that we had to expand the war there to “fight terror”. And to those who questioned the cherry-picked evidence, we were told that the [ultimate proof would come in the form of a mushroom cloud](http://crooksandliars.com/cltv/2014/05/condoleezza-rice-smoking-gun-be). Thus, anyone who opposed the war was labeled an “unpatriotic, anti-American, terrorist-sympathizing, weak-kneed, tree-hugging leftist.” The administration was relentless in suppressing all dissent – it even [leaked the identity of an undercover CIA agent](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/valerie-plame-wilson-no-ordinary-spy/) whose husband, a former ambassador, dared criticize the war. And that is how the invasion of Iraq happened. 

When things inevitably began to deteriorate, when the world found out about “enhanced interrogation” aka torture, [Abu Ghraib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse) and [Guantanamo Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp), the [Blackwater massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisour_Square_massacre), when our allies began to abandon us and our pointless war of aggression – none of it mattered. The president didn't care that he had squandered all the goodwill given to us after the attacks,  he didn't care that the world was beginning to hate us, he didn't care about the [thousands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War) of US troop deaths (the White House even [banned news coverage](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/07/iraq.iraqandthemedia) of military casket returning ceremonies to hide the mounting death toll from the public) or the [hundreds of thousands](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24547256) of Iraqi civilian deaths in a war of his choosing. America was “exceptional”, it was our “right” to do whatever we wanted and tell the international community to shove off. But in reality, America was alone, it was hated - and it was because of the actions and arrogance of the president and his cabinet. 

To pay for all of this, Congress (after having just spent billions, and eventually trillions of dollars on tax cuts) [increased the defense budget](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/downchart_gs.php?year=1990_2015&amp;view=1&amp;expand=30&amp;units=k&amp;fy=fy11&amp;chart=30-total&amp;bar=1&amp;stack=1&amp;size=m&amp;title=Defense%20Spending%20Chart&amp;state=US&amp;color=c&amp;local=s) 82% between 2001-2009, and is responsible for a 106% increase before it spending began to get reigned in again in 2011.

Halliburton, a company for which the vice president was the former chairman and CEO, [raked in $39.5 billion](http://readersupportednews.org/news-section2/308-12/16561-focus-cheneys-halliburton-made-395-billion-on-iraq-war). The vice president himself saw his stock in the company rise [by over 3000%](http://www.projectcensored.org/24-cheneys-halliburton-stock-rose-over-3000-percent-last-year/). The administration, for their part, [hid the cost](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/03/05/on_war_costs_bush_is_master_of_disguise/) as best they could by using emergency appropriations to keep the spending out of the federal budget. Emergency appropriations, they called them: “unexpected” spending – year after year after year. It was during this time that the [Department of Homeland Security](http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2002/06/homelandsecurity-daalder) was created, the most massive expansion in the size of government in decades. For many of these policies passed by the government to “fight terror”, many of us knew that it would only be a matter of time before before those powers granted would be used against us. I would say that history has vindicated us, but don't ask me – it's now 15 years later. What do you think?

Alright, enough, you're probably saying. Well, the reason I'm trying to paint such a vivid picture is because, like I said, it's easy to forget. At lot of people look at those years as so inconceivably backwards, we couldn't possibly return to that ever. But this isn't ancient history. This is what the United States of America was like the last time Republicans were put in charge. This happened IN OUR lifetimes, and it wasn't all that long ago. We need to be able to put our current situation in perspective. We need to realize that things are improving - maybe not as fast as we'd like, but change never happens overnight. We can't give up, can't divide ourselves over ""what next?"" - because what happened then can happen again, and it will happen again if we are so preoccupied with fighting against each other that we forget we're on the same side. This is a mistake we've made in the past, more than once – let's remember our history and learn from it so we don't doom ourselves to continue repeating it.",technology,1442085439
personalfinance,Car loan refinance - worth it?,"Hello everyone. This is my first post on here but I'm not that new to the site. If I posted something in the wrong section, please be easy on me :-) 

So in May of 2014, I purchased a used car with an interest rate of 10.5%, due to my poor credit from making some bad decisions. Since then, my credit has gone up greatly and I should be able to get a much lower rate if I wanted to refinance. 

At this point,  I owe $17995 on my loan and have 55 more payments to make (I'm paying ~$411 a month). I know refinancing will take a hit on my credit but I was wondering if I refinanced at about 4% with a 48 month loan, is it worth paying more with less interest, while taking the hit on credit, or leaving my loan as is and paying more on interest?",finance,1442087806

I hope you can give me some guidance. Throwaway because people know my actual reddit name and this situation is  humiliating. :( I just graduated from a private 4-year institution in May 2015 and realized that the financial choice to attend that university was extremely poor, but I didn't understand the effect loans would have in the long-run, and unfortunately my parents didn't either. My loans are currently being deferred because I am still considered a full-time student. 

I got a degree that is not marketable with just a BA, (psychology,) so I am currently at a junior college to finish pre-reqs for nursing school. My first quarter is paid off for the junior college, but I will have 4 quarters to pay for (each at about $1,500) after this fall quarter to finish my pre-reqs. 

I want to go to an accelerated nursing school in California once I finish my pre-reqs. I'm working as an on-call CNA while I continue going to school, so I have a *very small* income that varies month to month depending on how much I work. The pay is $11/hr. 

   My parents were unable to help me pay for college, so I took out private loans. Hindsight is 20/20, but here is where I currently stand.

    Private Loan #1: $70,399.09 
    Interest Rate: 5.49%

    Private Loan #2: $36,399
    Interest Rate: 5.00%

    Total Debt: $141,798.09

    I do not have any other debt, and I live with my parents. I do not own a car; my sister is allowing my to carpool with her to work. I will eventually have to obtain a car so that I can continue my schooling, but I don't know how I'll ever afford that. :/ My only other expenditure is my cell phone bill, which is $50/month.

    My plan is to use the avalanche method to pay down my debt with my eventual RN salary. I'll be an RN in 3 years if my schooling goes as planned. Somehow I'll have to also pay for nursing school, however. Obviously I intend to find the most affordable option there. 

    How can I afford to eventually get a car and pay for nursing school while I have this undergraduate debt hanging over my head? My 5-year goal is to move to California to live with my boyfriend, he is looking into buying a house and is much more financially stable than I am. We are planning our future together and he has agreed to house/feed me for 2 years while I get through nursing school so my primary expenditure will be my student loans during that time. Once I graduate I will be better able to pay off my loans with my nursing salary.

   I know I made a huge mistake in taking out these loans, but I'm trying to move forward responsibly from this point. Any advice on how to get this under control, or am I making a mistake by moving away, or thinking of getting a car? What do I need to prioritize and what do I absolutely have to wait on? I'm open to any advice.

Thank you in advance!!

When I applied for my loan, I stupidly checked off the box for ""University Recommended Amount"" for my loan, and therefore received an extra $20,000 in unused loan in the form of a refund from my school. After my jaw dropped, and I picked it back up, I immediately moved the money from my checking to savings account to hopefully accrue some interest (.15% APY / .15% dividend).

I'm terrible with finances elsewhere in my life, so I'm thinking I could use this like a personal loan to pay down some other debt? The loan is for $30,398.00 (one for $15,000, the other for $15,398) and both at an interest rate of 6.840%. Should I use the extra money to:

Remember the stars aligning? I had 5,000 as a down payment, which came via savings, a portion of financial aid, and selling my current vehicle. I am ""high risk"" due to my current school loans (low interest rate, high ratio. still in school), and medical bills. My credit store hovers around 575-595. My girlfriend, however, has a ""thin file"" and is a bit lower than mine.

Well, we got into a wonderful car, that I loved dearly. Even with my astronomical interest rate, I was still paying only 222 dollars. I could afford it, the car had under 50k miles, it ran beautifully, and it was one of my biggest accomplishments - finally, something I didn't buy off a corner, or from craigslist. It wasn't new, but it was the nicest thing I ever had.

Some degenerate saw fit to steal it last week. The payments are suspended for 60 days, and the claim is active (which can take up to 90 days). They have to investigate it thoroughly, but honestly they're buying time, which I understand - they don't want to pay off my balance anymore than I want my car stolen!

I was denied by a credit union. I was denied when I foolishly tried to get a new car. I do, however, have a 2015 that I got ""offered"" at 800 down, 14% APR, and an affordable (though higher) monthly payment. The dealer let me take it off the lot, but it is still subject to lender approval. On one hand, I have not put anything down (yet), so if they reneg, whatever - it probably saves me from a very stern commitment, but if they honor it, I can still afford it. 

My girlfriend is looking for a higher paying job (She has tenure and qualifications, but she just doesn't make enough) and I recently moved to a new job. It looks bad on paper, but I hope to retire from this company one day.

What options do I have? Being 24, with bad credit, still in school with more loans on the horizon (if i pursue a higher degree) how do I avoid craigslist?

personalfinance,Wondering about private student loans from about 10 years agol,"When I went to college, I made the mistake of going out of state in NC. I ended up having to take out 2 private loans to help pay for it. 

I ended up dropping out of school for family reasons, the loans became delinquent and ultimately went into default. This was around 2006 or 2007. I consolidated all of my federal loans around that time as well.

I had a few jobs that got me by, but I completely ignored those loans. I got calls, letters, etc. They seemed to bounce around from agency to agency, but I honestly just couldn't face them or even handle it at the time.

Anyway, it's nearly 10 years later. I have a pretty decent job now @ 75k a year. I took out a car loan a year ago that I'm paying on time comfortably. I have access to about $10000 in credit cards but only owe $500 at the moment, and I'll pay that off. There is no sign of these loans on my credit reports, nor do I receive calls or mail about them anymore. My credit score sits at about 720, and the main reason it's not higher seems to be the length of my credit history and that will just take time.

The only loan debt I can find is related to the Federal Loans I had consolidated. The balance was around $11000 when I checked a couple of months ago. And my tax refund was intercepted and applied to it, but that's the only action taken.

I'm about to seriously start entering down the path towards marriage (probably 2 or so years from now) and I want to make sure that I get everything under control and situated before that happens.

To my questions though.
   1.Is it worth worrying about those private loans anymore?
   2. I want to pay back the Federal Loans because I don't want my refund taken every year, but I'm not sure how to begin that process. And if I do, what is the effect on my credit? That loan doesn't appear on my credit report now either. If I start a repayment plan, will it be added onto my report in a bad state?

personalfinance,What to do with savings while paying off student loans?,"Hi all,

My wife and I are both employed earning a pretty modest salary (I'm earning ~$45-50k a year, she earns about ~$20k). We currently have about $77k in combined student loan debt (about $6k at 7% interest, $30k at 6.25%, $26k at 4.25%, and a few other private loans at lower interest rates). 


I'm paying all of the loans at a standard repayment plan at the moment, while throwing a couple hundred extra bucks a month at the highest interest rate loan (about $1100 a month for all loans). We're earning just enough besides that for a 1 bedroom apartment, about $250/mo for groceries, $300 for utilities and car insurance, and a modest amount for entertainment and other expenses.


I've got about $15,000 saved right now, and I'm considering what to do with it. The first option, of course, is to throw it all at the student loans. However, my wife and I would love to buy a house sooner than later, so I'd love to be on our way towards the goal of a down payment. I'd also be worried about not having an emergency fund. I've been considering the ideas of investing it into a CD or other investment opportunities until we are out of student loan debt (hopefully by another 5 years... sigh... ).


Should I forget the down payment on the house goal and just throw everything I earn towards the loans? Or continue to save while paying the loans simultaneously?

tl;dr: $15k saved for house down payment, $77k in school loans. Pay off school loans or invest savings for later?",finance,1442115563
personalfinance,My ex-roommate might have stole my checks. Advice please. (cross-post from r/legal advice),"I live in New Jersey. Background: My ex-roommate is in her early 30's and I used to live with her for roughly 7months through 2013 to 2014. She is an emotionally manipulative and deceitful person and I have suffered enough heartache because of her lying and taking advantage of me. Partly it was my fault back then because I was too naive and was afraid to speak my mind - I was a doormat.
I called up my insurance company to ask why I am not receiving 4 checks that includes: sept 2014 ($90), Oct 2014 ($300), April 2015 ($400), May 2015 ($200), total of $990. These should all have been arrived by now because the insurance company had almost always sent the checks within 4 weeks I've fedexed the reimbursement claim form to them.
The claim advisor had told me that all 4 checks were deposited and she sent me the copy of checks to my email. I thought this was really weird because I tracked down my e-banking account and found no evidence depositing each of these amounts to my bank account. The reason I am skeptical of my ex-roommate behind all of this is because for few times in the past the insurance company had forgot to update my mailing address and some of my checks went to the ex-roommate's address which then I had to call the insurance company to void the checks and get them send a new check to me when I've they have told me that some checks were sent to the old address. You might think that it is impossible for her to deposit the check since the check has my name as the recipient but surprisingly, 2 years ago my brother deposited my checks to his account(which is his money that I owed)that had my name on it. So I asked the insurance company if they can track down who deposited my 4 checks, they said it was not possible for them to find out whom. I asked my brother if he took the check but he said no. My brother is not kind of person who lies to me and he financially supports me anyway.
Is there any way that I can identify who stole the 4 checks? I use Bank of America just for reference. If it is found to be my ex-roomate to be the one, what is a possible legal action I could take? She is not a US citizen/permanent resident and she holds some kind of temporary visa or O-visa(artist's visa). I don't care about the money to be honest, but I want her to pay for what she did – at least to be kicked out of US or go to jail for committing a crime.

Another accused murderer was Mangle well that was wrong too this was also a very well believed story as mangle has an unusual jump scare unlike the rest of the animatronics who attack you face to face mangle comes from the roof and attacks the area where you have your frontal lobe of your head (which is where the bite of 87 was.)But we still have the question as to who was the murderer? It was actually our beloved friend Fazbear also known as Golden Freddy so what happened was there once was a little boy who was crying in the pizzeria because he was scared and he was actually afraid of the Golden Freddy suit. So then some bullies dragged him over and as a joke put him forcefully into Fredbears wide open mouth the boy then cried so much the wiring in the animatronic glitched and Fazbears mouth shut forcefully the boy then became limp and was confirmed dead. But this was only the bite of 87 and this was only the start of the story. We all know the poor boy that got killed by Fazbear? Well the amazing thing was this child was the son of the purple guy (purple guy was the person who murdered the kids) and so he was so angry that the bullies put his son in Fazbears mouth he thought that he would get revenge. So he dressed up in one of the suits and then lead all the kids that killed his son into the backroom and murdered them all they were then stuffed into the suits and that’s how we got our 5 animatronics.

My other credit card is from Wells Fargo and is 23 months old. It also has a high variable interest rate at 21.99%


Can I reduce the interest rate by calling Citi and asking for a lower APR? Would that open a new account? Should I close the Wells Fargo account and apply for a lower interest credit card? Should I close them both? 

Closing one or both credit cards and opening new ones will negatively impact the average age of my accounts. Closing the Citi card will negatively impact the age of my oldest account.

I just started grad school and I think I may need a car. Right now my take home is around $1900/month and I pay $750 in rent.

My rent is just above average for the town as I'm renting  a furnished apartment and on campus. I'm looking to eventually move further out so I can save at least $200 on rent (but then I'll have to budget for buying furniture, which should just be a one time payment).

Right now, I use zipcar and it's running me between $30-50/week depending on what I need to do, and traffic. A zip car is perfect where I am living now, but if I move further out, it'll be harder to actually get to the zipcar. 

My question is how do I go about looking for cars and buying one? I don't have parents with me in the US to help me navigate the system but I've been doing a lot of reading on my own.

1)I'm thinking about a used car ideally under 14k (including dealer fees) Hopefully a 2010/2011 prius so it'll help save on gas. I've also read they're good to maintain and they're pretty reliable. 

2)My credit score is around 760. But my credit history is between 4-5 years. I have three credit cards, none with a single late payment so I think I can get a low interest rate

3)I do have around 17k in student loans remaining, but I got them deferred as I'm full time in school again. I'm still planning on making at least the minimum payments so I can whittle away at them. So I'm looking at $350/mnth for that.

4)I still have a few months remaining to look. Does the used car inventory frequently change? I live in a big college town so I'm going to wait until the end of the school year to buy to see if anyone is selling their car.

5)Anything specific I should lookout for when buying a used car?

6)I'm budgeting an extra $200 a month for insurance/gas/maintenance. Of course this will vary from car to car but I think it's a good starting point to consider in creating my budget for now.

7)My bank account is low from moving all the way out here so I'm not sure how much of a downpayment I will be able to make. What should I aim to save? Right now, I can probably do $300-400 a month from next month (gotta make sure I pay off my credit card bill in full first before it comes due) and around $150 this month.

personalfinance,Mortgage company has been stealing from me!,"I bought my house back in 2006. My mortgage has been sold to about 3 or 4 different companies and has been with Quicken Loan since July 2013. Every time my loan is sold to another company all of my information has simply carried over to the new account. My loan was originally setup to pay automatically and that auto-pay information has carried over each time my loan has changed hands. I never think about my payment - the money comes out of my account and that's that.

Today I was looking for information on how my monthly payment is broken down (principal/interest/escrow/etc) so I pulled up the most recent statement and noticed that I was charged a $58.77 late fee. I checked every statement going back to when Quicken Loans bought my loan and they have charged me $58.77 for the past 27 months! That's $1586.79 so far! According to my account information, my loan is due on the first of every month and my auto-pay is set for the 1st of every month.

I've checked the statement from the previous loan-holder and my due date was also on the 1st of every month and my auto-pay was made on the 1st of every month. What recourse do I have against Quicken Loans? These assholes have harassed me with offers to lower my interest rate just to keep me happy -- then when we walk down that path all of these hidden fees crop up that I had to dig to discover... I'm so mad right now. Do I have any change of getting my $$ back?

Edit: [Image of statement](http://i.imgur.com/sW4UtUq.png)

Edit 2: It looks like they haven't actually been charging me a late fee -- the statement shows the total due with the late fee, but the actual amount removed from my account is the amount due *without* the fee. How hard is it to make a bill that reads properly?",finance,1442169561

personalfinance,Do my existing interest rates impact future rates?,"This might be a dumb question, but I can't find a simple answer, so I figured I'd check here... 


My husband and I have several credit cards between us.  I have 3 from before we were married, he has 1, then we have 2 joint cards.  Of all of those, we only actually use 1 of the joint cards, the rest are sitting with zero balance and have been for years (the second joint card has never been used, it was offered to us when we jointed a credit union and we accepted it as our emergency card when we bought our first house, but they've increased our credit limit twice for being such ""good customers""). Also, all of the inactive cards have $0 annual fees or anything, so they're ""free"".  The one card we use (Alaska Airlines) has a $75 annual fee, but it's worth it for us because we live in AK and travel quite a bit to see family so the miles/rewards are awesome. 


We pay off the one card we do use every month and never pay any interest.  Our credit scores have been steadily improving over the years (in the low/mid-600's during college, to 783/802 now according to credit karma).  Our credit really started to improve dramatically after we bought our first house in 2011 but we got all of the cards prior to that point, so they all have high interest rates (I don't know the inactive cards exactly but between 10-20%, and the AkAir card is 17.99%). 


I've never really cared that much about it because we don't ever pay interest anyway.  But as I'm starting to pay more attention to our financial picture, I'm wondering if it's worth calling to try and get the interest rates lowered? Do our current rates impact any future rates we may be offered? We currently have 3 outstanding loans (mortgage[4.25%], car[1.75%] and boat[5.35%]) and I feel like these are at good interest rates; although once we pay the house down enough to get rid of the PMI, we are planning on looking into refinancing at a lower rate if we can, which will hopefully be in 2016 some time.  


Also, is it worth closing the inactive cards (except for our oldest each) I worry about having so many open accounts because I have to remember to check them periodically to make sure there's no activity or anything.

personalfinance,"I'm(18f), kicked out, diabetic, no job, no car, please help. (x-post from r/needadvice)","Alright guys, buckle in, this is going to be long and complicated.

I originally posted in relationships but it was removed because it was not the correct place for this.

Some backstory might be helpful here, I'm not sure what's useful here and what's not, so please bear with me. I apologize for all the info I'm about to throw at you, and any spelling or fluency errors. Please let me know if something doesn't make sense. I'm still reeling and am feeling a little jumbled.

My mom and dad (both 42) have not always had the greatest relationship, they were never married, and my mom often tells me that one of the worst decisions she ever made was telling him she was pregnant with me. He was a heroin addict for a long time, and was imprisoned from the time I was six until I was about ten. When he returned he was basically a stranger to me, and i wanted nothing to do with him. Recently we have been building a better relationship and he has a great job, I'm genuinely proud of him.
Approximately two years ago we all moved in together into a lovely house. Things were going farely well, but I think the close quarters, or whatever it may be, made things grow steadily worse. My dad is an abusive man. Never ever has he been physical or anything like that, but it's much more 
emotional/psychological/mental abuse. 

My mom finally got fed up and told him in no uncertain terms that if he did not improve or go to therapy or both that we would both be gone. This was around christmas. (i have come to hate most holidays, especially christmas because of how horrible he makes things). Well he was doing much better. Really. And then...ya it got bad real fast.

to summarize this event shortly: at a family party, moms best male friend(35m) had just lost his dad and his good friend, she was comforting him, my dad is drunk at this point and he despises this friend, is convinced they are cheating together, he pulls me my mom outside and starts SCREAMING in her face about how she was disrespecting him in front of anyone, how friend only wants to fuck her, blah blah. my uncle went out there and my dad immediately acted like everything was fine and my uncle was obviously not buying that shit and stayed out there until my dad went inside.

At this point my mom was done. We started packing up, and were completely gone in 2 days. Everything in that house was ours. There is nothing there save for a few eating utensils and such and whatever my dad owned himself.

OK ok, now the real problem. Let me preface this by saying I am not winning any medals in the best kid department. I am horrible at cleaning after myself, I am making an effort but it is not up to my mom's standards who i really believe has very slight OCD. I stuck through this whole thing with her and helped her through a rather difficult time. I'm proud of her for finally standing up for herself after so many years of me, and others, telling her that hey guess what you're in an abusive relationship.

Anyway, we moved into a lovely apartment, and are just getting it to look like our home. Last night my mom and I got into a huge fight where she called me a narcissictic selfish bitch, and how I make her sad and depressed and how she had been contemplating killing herself this week, so I needed to leave. But she also said she had been planning on changing the locks this wednesday so I couldn't come back. She kicked me out.

The only place I can go is my dad's. (Important sidenote: I am raising a guide dog puppy, and so there are specific regulations on where i can live because of the safety of the pup. So the apartment and my dad's.)

I can go to my dad's easily, I've talked to him, it's fine. But I really cannot live there long term. It is toxic.
I also am starting college in january. So here's where it gets tricky, I am a type 1 diabetic and have been very uncontrolled meaning i could not get my license. I am doing much better now and can get my permit back to be able to get my license later.
But I have no job(working on it, i think iv'e found one.) and my supplies are about $1050+ for a 3 month supply. I have hit my deductible for this year so that's taken care of, but this year is also quickly coming to a close.]

I need to pay for these supplies, a computer, a car eventually, driving school, textbooks, whatever, etc.
I have no idea how to do any of this. I feel like I'm drowning. My dad isn't going to be the best teacher for any of this as he doesn't really know how to do it either. I'm honestly really worried about just getting to my doctors appointments and the vet because i don't think he'll take me, especially if he disagrees. For example I'm going to get the nexplanon implant in a few months and I very much doubt he will take me because he doesn't understand why an 18 year old girl should be on birth control, especially one so weird and unconventional. Why can't I take the pill? Why do I need it at all? On and on.

How the fuck do I do any of this? Noone prepared me to be a functioning adult, because noone I know really is. My mom would be the best bet, but she isn't going to help me. We're not really talking and I don't think we'll be able to for a long time. There is also no internet/computer at my dads so applying for jobs and working out school and such is going to be interesting.
I know this might not be so bad compared to a lot of these other things but I have no idea what to do. This is my world and it seems like it's crumbling fast.

TL;DR; mom and I left abusive dad, she then kicked me out of our apartment, i have no license, no job, no car, no reliable resources, and have many many things to pay for like life saving medication. Had to move back to my dad's. I feel like I'm drowning and I really need some actual help.",finance,1442174440

Wife has her Master's completed and makes $60,000 a year, she also has $50,000 of student loan debt.  I'm starting the last year of my master's, which is completely paid for and I have a stipend of $10,000 per year through school. But I also have $50,000 in student loans from my undergrad.  We have no credit card debt. We owe about $6,000 loan on my wife's used car at 1.9% or so. I own my car free and clear.

Right now all the money is in a trust and being invested. My dad is in charge of it until I'm 27 but he is willing to give out money for good causes.

We've been paying $700 a month towards my wife's student loans. We don't have to start paying mine until 6 months after I graduate.

I feel like I've got a good chance to set ourselves up well.  So please critique my plan and offer any insight you can.

-Pay off my $50,000 of loans.
-my other grandmother has graciously offered to loan us $50,000 at 0% and pay her instead of the government, my wife's loans have pretty high interest rates. This will save us a good chunk of change in interest and allow us to pay them off faster. She is also a multi-millionaire so she is not stretching herself thin to help us.
-not planning to pay off my wife's car because the interest rate is so low.
-take my wife to Europe for a month when I finished my master's. Gotta splurge on something!

Basically, is it worth it to pay off $50,000 of loans with cash? Or should we keep the $50,000 invested and just chip away at the loans until we are in our mid to late 30's? I get very anxious thinking about paying those loans off for the foreseeable future and think it might be worth it just for peace of mind.

personalfinance,"$140K/yr salary late 20’s SINK, $175K to invest. Read wikis. Ready to rebalance portfolio. Does my plan work?","Dear PF,

I am an example of the “power of inertia.” I read the Boglehead book a few years ago, but have mostly held individual equities since. I knew that switching over to a lazy portfolio was the right thing to do.. but I was ironically, too lazy to do anything about it. I have taken a beating in the last few weeks, and would like to get on the right path.

Below is a very long post containing A) a ton of context about me, B) what I think I should do, and C) some questions that I have. I would really appreciate your wisdom.

**A) About me:**

I just finished graduate school, and will re-join the working world in the next few months.  When I picked my initial 401K allocations (and bought individual equities on my own), I was an idiot who had no idea what he was doing. Feel free to tell me that, but please also give me something constructive.

* **Stats:** Late 20s SINK
* **Income:** $140K/yr salary. $40K bonus.
* **Expenses:** $2K/mo in rent/utilities. $2K/mo eating out, going out, etc. Intend on saving the rest. Will not need a car in the next few years
* **Current emergency fund:** $5K
* **Current investments** ($175K total. $142K in retirement accounts. $32K in brokerage. I don’t think you need the detail below, but in case you do, here it is):

***Schwab ($86K):***

Brokerage ($22K):

* AMZN: $12.7K
* MON: $9.5K

Roth IRA ($64K):

* Cash: $5.6K
* AMZN: $11K
* AAPL: $11K
* BRKB: $13K
* MON: $9.2K
* TSLA: $8.5K
* WMT: $5.6K

***Fidelity ($88K):***

401K ($78K):

401K 1 ($34K):

* Dodge &amp; Cox Large Cap: $8.4K
* TRP Retirement 2050: $6.9K
* Vang Morgan Grth ADM: $6.45K
* TRP Retirement 2010: $4.5K
* TRP Retirement BAL: $4.2K
* Metwest Tot Rtn: $2.7K
* MIP II CL 1: $1.2K

401K 2 ($43K):

* Vanguard Target ret 2055: $43.7K
* Fidelity balanced K: $0.6K

Brokerage account: $10K in former company stock

Debt: None

Things to note:

1. I expect ~$40K in income for this calendar year
2. I paid about $25K in tuition this calendar year
3. I have held all equities for more than 1 year. 
4. I have not made my 2015 Roth IRA contribution


**B) What's next:** I will build up an emergency fund of $35K, and also sign up for my new company’s 401K. What I need help with is re-balancing my current investments. Based on what I have read on PF, I think here are the steps that I need to take. I would love your feedback.

Basically, I have $64K in a Roth and $78K in tax advantaged accounts. Plus $32K in non-retirement accounts. To maximize tax efficiency, I should put bond funds into the Roth, then equities into the remainder of the Roth / 401K / brokerage accounts (in that order). Based on the Bogleheads wiki, I would like to build a three fund portfolio similar to the following (assuming $175K investable):

* 30% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX): $52.5K
* 35% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX): $61.25K
* 35% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX): $61.25K

The issue is that not every 401K offers those specific funds, but there are comparables (with similar expense ratios). So I would just use the comparable instead.

To do this, I would:

**I) Move Roth IRA to Fidelity:**

*Why:* Retail investors cannot buy into VBTLX or FSITX (Fidelity equivalent). Schwab's
bond funds have high expense ratios. I love the customer service at Schwab, but I don’t really see a way around this that is not involved and painful.

1. Open up Roth IRA at Fidelity
2. Move Roth IRA from Schwab over to Fidelity
3. Sell equities in Roth IRA
4. Buy $52.5K of FSITX
5. Use remaining $11.5K to buy FSTVX or FSGDX (Fidelity US/Intl). Which should I buy?

**II) Rebalance the two 401Ks:** Just allocate between the two 401Ks. Should I favor the international or US market equities funds in the 401Ks? Which is more favorable in a non-tax advantaged brokerage account (step III)?

**III) Balance brokerage accounts:** In brokerage accounts (Schwab &amp; Fidelity), buy whichever fund was not purchased in I / II. To keep things simple, I will probably move the Fidelity brokerage account into Schwab (I like Schwab’s checking too much to give up the account).

Does this seem like a sound plan?


**C) Further questions:**

***0) Bond funds in Roth IRA:***I read about this in the Bogleheads wiki - but does that really make sense? From my perspective, it seems like I should put stock funds, which will likely have more appreciation over time, in the Roth IRA instead. Especially given current interest rates...

***1) Backdoor Roth IRA:***While I could roll the 401Ks into an IRA, I would like to take advantage of the backdoor Roth IRA starting in 2016. So I should keep these in the 401K, provided at there are no account fees (I need to check with Fidelity on this come Monday)?

***2) Autopilot:***Going forward, is there an autopilot way to hit this kind of allocation? Like if I direct deposit X% of my paycheck into my accounts on a bi-weekly basis, can I tell them to auto buy a certain amount?

***3) What to do with brokerage accounts:***Going forward again, I plan on maxing my 401K contribution as well as doing the backdoor Roth from question 1. Besides that, I should just keep the saved/invested money in a brokerage account, right?

***4) 401K to Roth conversion:*** Since my income this year will be ~$40K, should I convert some of my current 401K amounts into the Roth IRA? I suppose I could recognize up to the bracket limit of $90,750 to stay at 25% tax. Is there any advantage to doing this? My income will not drop below $90K for the foreseeable future.

personalfinance,Advice needed: How to best use money from parents for real estate or debt,"Recently, my mother offered a significant amount of money (200k) to motivate my wife and me to move to a bigger place to better support our family in the long run. I'm looking for advice from you guys to help me make a good decision. Here are the details you will need to consider our situation:

* We moved into our current place (our first home) 3 years ago. Purchase price was 350k via FHA and I owe ~300k still at 3.75%. Houses in my neighborhood go for 400k+ today. My home is in good condition, is large for the neighborhood, and shouldn't be hard to sell if we go that route. We have plenty of space now. However, I can see it getting slowly get harder with a second (yet to be conceived) kid.
* We have about $50k saved so far.
* Mom offered 200k interest-free loan. She would provide it to us via line of credit against her debt-free home.
* I make ~200k / yr and my wife is a stay at home mom of one.
* I have ~100k in student loans (interest rate is 5%, half federal and half private loans). Besides this and our home, we have no other debt.
* We live in the DC metro area. Housing has been appreciating quickly.
* We have very good credit.
* We are not savvy investors so anything outside of real estate or paying down debt is probably outside the realm of possible.
* We are a single-income home of three; our risk tolerance is lower but not nil.
* The bank of mom is pretty flexible on repayment.
* I contribute to my 401k.

Some options I have considered:

* Take her up on her original offer: sell my place and buy a place with 4-5 BR and more space in a better neighborhood (thinking 600-700k). Enjoy not moving for a long time.
* Take some money to do a little renovation in my current place so that it is more attractive to sell in the next 2-5 years. Save like a mad man while waiting for a later time to sell. (Same concerns as above). 
* Pool our money and buy an investment property. Use the cashflow to save and buy later (in addition to the concerns above, I would have to deal with renters. Also, I don't think cashflow would be significant because of housing costs in this area).
* Take the money to wipe out some or all of my student loan debt. Use the money to pay her back and also save for a while until we really need to move. (Afraid of losing out on low interest rates and also the rate of appreciation of real estate.)

Obviously there are some emotional components of this decision, but I'm leaving those out. I'm looking for advice purely from a rational / factual perspective.

And I have about 900 that i have to spend on rent, utility, gas and food. I am stuck in a 10 month lease and can not afford to break my contract because it will cost 3500 that I do not have. Overall I need to pay about 1450 a month but my job pays me about 1200 a month after taxes.

Is there any way to fix the situation that I am in? I have not been able to find someone to split rent with because I am in a 1 bedroom apartment with someone already where I am sleeping in the living room. So adding another roommate would almost be impossible. My overall credit debt is close to 13,000 because I've been using my credit to pay for school. Now that I finished college, I've been trying to find a way to clear my debt while paying rent. Is there any way to lower my 400$ credit payments? Any advice will help. All I feel like I can wish for is for my job to promote me to full time within a few months and acquire another job. These jobs that I have are not high paying jobs.

My goal is to work these 2 part time jobs or a full time job to help me pay my debt until I get hired.

personalfinance,"Auto Loan several months past due / In repossession status, Just got employed again. Advice.","Hello guys! So, the TLDR of my life current is that stuff happened, and I've been unemployed from Janurary till the end of August. Started a job August 24th, got my first paycheck the 11th, and is already drained down to 'This is what I need to live' amounts from other debts that held other serious consequences within my current circumstances. My next paycheck should be a a nice sum with very little coming out of it. 

Anyway, my auto loan is almost 4 months behind, most likely close to 2k$ behind by now based on the lenders fees, I know for sure it's in repo status, however surprisingly they've not found me. 

As it stands right now, I don't want to confront them empty handed, as I'm confident the first comment will be "" What's your current location so we can repo the car"" ... I guess? 

I haven't had the time with work to sit down with my bank (As my hours are odd, and makes it hard to get to places during the day when banks are normally open), however I've heard they have a plan in which they will pay for outstanding debts, and consolidate loans. Granted, I've got tons of other debt, but my car is my first priority. The bank I'm with now is a local credit union I just joined from good words from friends. So I don't know a huge amount as they have little online aside from what's required about rates and such. 

Do you think a credit union may refinance the loan from my current lender and readjust my monthly at a higher interest? Maybe they'll buy it out and set their own inflated interest rate? Any advice as to what do to about the current outstanding loan? I'm confident it's heading towards a legal matter, however I no longer reside at the residence they have on file, cannot acquire mail from there, nor is the phone number they had working any longer. It's been complete radio silence. I'm worried about changing my address for them finding my car, which I need desperately currently to even keep my job. Now I'm freaking out about, what if I get pulled over? Can they seize my car?

I am seeking a quick logic check on my taxes this year.  I am planning to roll over some Traditional IRA funds to my Roth IRA, because of this I will absorb the difference as additional income, thus generating a higher tax liability.  I have had zero allowances all year which should result in a refund, however I would like to roll over as much as possible into Roth WITHOUT generating a tax bill next April.  I have put together some hypothetical numbers and calculations to project how much I should roll into my Roth IRA, any and all feedback is much appreciated!
 
**Current expected projection:**

Gross Income – 68,747

Tax liability – 10,406

Federal withholdings – 12,224

Refund – 1,818
 
**Roth addition expected projection:**

Income – 68,747

Roth income – 7,000

Gross Income – 75,747

Tax Liability – 12,156

Federal withholdings – 12,224

Refund - 68

My mom works a job where they are going to be laid off for a couple of week this month. Due to the layoff, there will be a delay in her getting her paychecks, but she will still bring home around 80% of her normal pay. She has been making the minimum payment on the line of credit, $450. She has also been paying as much as possible on her credit card, usually around $800, the minimum payment is $134 this month. During the time she is laid off she will be able to make her minimum payments but she is wanting to borrow against her line of credit to continue making larger payments to her credit card. Is this a smart option? Does anyone know of a calculator that can help show how much this will save her. If this is not the best option, what is?


Here are the details on her accounts:


She has 2 revolving credit accounts, one credit card with at 4988.29 balance as of her last statement and a 24.49% interest rate, there have been no new charges to the account. Her next payment is due on 10/1. Her other account is a line of credit with a balance 13660.42 and and interest rate of 14.24%. Her next payment is due on 9/20.

personalfinance,Head almost under water...,"Thanks for reading. I am a long time lurker but can’t remember my old username after I got a new phone hence the new account. …
So long story short I am horrible with saving/budgeting money. I am 28 and have gone through my savings over the past 3 or 4 years and now am down to nothing. I have a decent job and my monthly after tax is ~4000. My absolute bills (e.g. mortgage, utilities, truck payment/insurance etc…) come out to around 2400$. 
I have racked up about 4500$ in credit card bills total on 2 different cards. First card has a $1200 limit with a 9.9APR and I owe $1000. Second card has a whopping 22%APR with a $5600 limit and I owe $3500. 
 I set up a budget on Mint to try and reign things in a bit but the past few months due to some house damage I have gone over budget and drained my savings completely. I still live OK and do have spare cash to live on after all my bills are paid (I am never late on any). 
I am trying to budget as much as possible to pay off the big APR card asap (looking like I can push 500$ a month towards it). The problem is everytime I throw a bunch of money at the card to try and pay it off quicker something happens and I need to use it again for an emergency(I never use my CC's for anything but emergencies... this has been a crazy unlucky summer...).
So down to my questions…
1.	Should I call the low APR cc and ask to increase my limit and transfer funds? I think there is a 3% rate on transfers up to 200$
2.	Should I open a new card with a promotional 0%APR and free tranfers and move both card balances over and pay on one without ever using any of the cards anymore
3.	Am I in horrible shape? I Keep trying to look around to see if I am in the norm, but then keep seeing other posts with people my age that have these huge savings and 0 debt… are those people just way ABOVE the norm? I am not trying to make excuses for myself and I know I need to tame my spending but at the same time I don’t want to have to become a hermit and not live life while I still can.
4.	Should I seek out a financial adviser? Would they help in this case or they are really only good with people that need to spread around there massive amounts of money?
5.	Should I take out a loan to pay both cards at a lower interest rate?... not sure if this is possible but for some reason my credit is still pretty good (around 730) so I don’t see it being impossible…

All in all I am just sick of living paycheck to paycheck and worrying about not being able to make my bill payments. I do have a couple IT side jobs but they are sporadic so I cant ever count on the money. Not sure where to go from here.... any advice would be appreciated.

personalfinance,Pros/Cons of refinancing a Parent Plus Loan in student's name.,"Firstly, I'm the child (was the student). My parents are not pushing this, and are ok with my choice either way. I am trying to find the best financial path for myself. As I understand it, even being able to do this is generally difficult as few lenders will allow it (edit: ala http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2015/05/20/learn-how-to-transfer-parent-plus-loans-to-a-child through SoFi or DRB), and it's a large amount of debt. I am curious about the benefits and drawbacks of refinancing the loan and gaining the debt.

Some approximate numbers for context:

* My age: 28
* My gross annual income: $85k
* About how long I've had such an income: 1.5 years
* Current FICO score: 750
* FICO score about a year ago: 615 (I previously had little income, maxed out cards totaling ~8k, and additional medical debt)
* Credit Card debt I don't pay off every month: $0 (been that way as soon as I could pay them off)
* Car Loan: $10k at 5.75% (which I also plan on trying to refinance)
* Student Loans Total: $18k at 2-6.6% (some of which I am considering refinancing)

Not in my name:

* Consolidated Parent Loan 1: $50k at 7.9%
* Consolidated Parent Loan 2: $30k at 7.25%


From what I've gathered so far, these are some pros and cons.

**Pros:**

* I can acquire a lower interest rate, and end up paying a smaller amount now and/or in total.
* It formalizes the informal agreement between my parents and I that it is my responsibility. I'm paying on it myself already, and intend on doing so regardless.
* Greater piece of mind for my parents? Arguable. See Cons.
* My parent's credit worthiness goes up.

**Cons:**

* I formally and legally gain a massive liability, that I cannot escape from without paying off.
* My credit worthiness goes down (How much?)
* The new private loan would not be as safe in terms of having an IBR or similar to fall back on in the event of hard times.
* Can't change payment plans on the fly (switch from 10 to 25 year repayment plan, or the other way)

How much would my credit worthiness go down? I'm mainly weighing in my head the gain of having a lower interest rate, and the drawback of a worse credit worthiness for future purchases, like a house. I'll have the debt for a while, so even if I want to buy a house years down the road, the debt will likely still haunt me. Which is better?",finance,1442261342

   The timeframe of these loans is over the course of 2010-2014. I can get more specific if needed. I graduated from school and am now trying to create a budget for myself, which starts with finding monthly loan payments. 

   Obviously i'd like to pay the least amount of money over the shortest possible of time with the lowest possible interest rate. I have to pay back all of the loans shown here with my own money. I've been staring at the various websites with this information for a couple days now and am very confused about a few things:

* To what extent would consolidation be a viable option for me? By this I mean, my loans are spread over 3 separate parties, and 2 separate servicers. Can consolidation occur across separate parties and servicers? If so would it even be worth it?

* How exactly does unpaid interest work? I'm confused at the separation of principle and unpaid interest. Would my monthly payments begin at the unpaid interest or would it start at the principle? I'm very scared of the idea of interest being accrued on principle while i'm paying off interest.

* Why does interest get insane if i consolidate my loans? Every repayment tool shows my interest being over $100,000 dollars more than what it would be pre-consolidation? I dont understand how this can be if the interest rate stays around the average of the loans to begin with.

* I don't understand refinancing at all but would that be something i should look into? Is it possible to refinance PLUS loans into something else with a lesser interest rate? 7.9% is so ridiculously high to me. Is refinancing something that banks will even allow to a new college student?

* Are there any tips/tricks/loopholes i can use to my advantage to help pay these off? I've spent the last 2-3 days reading everything I can about these loans so i can understand them. I made the mistake of agreeing to these loans when I was in college and knew nothing about finance. All I understand right now are the terms of my own loans; any knowledge extending beyond this is completely lost to me for the time being.


Sorry for the long post, i feel like this is just the bare minimum of the details i could provide though haha.

I currently have a 37k/ year salaried job with benefits, pension/medical/tuition assist... It's a state job and very stable. They also know I'm a student and give me a lot of slack when it comes to schedule, as well as reimburse up to 9 cr per year which is roughly 9k depending on how I claim the benefit. I just became eligible for that as a full timer and would lose it if I dropped my hours. Next year sometime I should become eligible for double that, but full time work and engineering school does not scale forever. 

On the other hand. I'm a mechanical engineering student about half way through my degree. I'm averaging like 3-6 cr per semester including summers (15cr/year) and have roughly 60 cr left to go. So that's 4 years more at this rate. 

Since I've started to get tuition reimbursement my funds have been much more stable but I'm by no means where I'd like to be. I'm 30 with a previous BA, basically no debt but very little retirement savings so far. So I'm starting to get serious finally.

I suppose the question is this. If I continue on as I am I'll have no student debt but 4 more years of low wages (3.5% yearly raises if I'm lucky) before I graduate and can potentially double my salary or more. We recently hired a student coworker of mine full time for 70k I believe which bodes well for me getting at least that or more a few years from now. 

Option two is to basically go back to school full time and essentially stop working, I can maybe handle 12 hrs a week in a student position. I'd be done in 2 years with about 21k worth of tuition debt plus at least that again for cost of living expenses. So I'd say conservatively I'd expect to finish with 55k in debt though I expect it would be closer to 65k if I'm being honest. 

I already have a previous BA and am not sure how much federal assistance I've got left, and I've not taken out any private student loans so I'm not sure if they are much worse than the 6.8% I was paying on my old stuff. 

I guess the trade off other than just taking out debt is that I'll have less of guaranteed job after the 2 years is up if I go that route. Though I'm fairly confident I can manage as my experience and age helps me vs my younger peers at school. 

Any thoughts or insight on this? I really like being debt free but I'm not completely risk adverse, especially if I can jump start my long term financial goals by getting that salary bump asap.

personalfinance,I'm 22. I recently started my first full-time job and I have a lot of questions to optimize my personal finance.,"Hi All,

I've lurked this subreddit for some time now and I have a few questions I'd really love detailed responses to if possible. I started my first full time job and after a month, I really want to start creating my specific budget, figuring out the best ways to save, and etc. 

To get started, here is my list of a bunch of random facts:

1. I'm currently making $64k per year.
2. I have about $10k in savings right now that I'd like to consider my ""emergency fund.""
3. I have no student/car loans whatsoever.
4. I just recently opened up a Roth IRA through Fidelity that I have not contributed to yet so far.
5. My company provides a 401(k) plan, but unfortunately does not have an Employer Matching Program. 
6. In December, I'll be able to enlist in the Employer Stock Purchase Plan (which I plan to do so as my company's stock price is decent).
7. My rent is about $1,400 per month including utilities. I know I'm paying a buttload for my rent alone unfortunately. 

With all this said, a few questions are:

1. Even if my employer does not have a 401k matching plan, should I enroll in the program? I was considering simply maxing my Roth IRA for this year and maybe the next and that was going to be the only ""main"" retirement account I was going to use. However, I have been told that regardless of the matching program, it might be a good thing to just enroll as it'll basically be forced savings per month that'll rack up due to compound interest eventually.

2. I was also considering utilizing my Schwab Brokeragelink account to start investing and creating my diversified portfolio, but I hardly know anything about this process and was told that I can just automate it so once a % of my paycheck gets direct deposited into the Brokeragelink account, it would invest itself.
3. Should I forget the above and just focus on maxing out my Roth IRA for the first 2 years of my career? I've considered this mainly as I'd like the extra disposable income due to my rent being so expensive. Also, what are the date (timeline) parameters of contributing the full $5,500 per year into my Roth IRA?
4. Should I move my $10k to a different savings account that has a higher interest rate? It's currently sitting in my BoA savings account.
5. I should be maxing out of my ESPP once I'm able to enroll in it, right?

Please let me know if I can provide you with any additional information. I'm really grateful for all the kind people here and I'd like to apologize in advance if there are any questions that may have a simple answer to it.

Thank you so much!",finance,1442288283

personalfinance,Need help deciding between two cards. Citi double cash and a USAA card.,"Hello PF! I need some advice deciding between two cards. I graduated college last May and did ROTC so I will be heading out for active duty soon. I have a 720+ credit score with a 5 year card history and auto loan. 

I'm looking at these two cards for my first credit cards. A [USAA](https://www.usaa.com/inet/pages/bank_cc_preferred_cash_rewards_world_mastercard?showtab=ccRatesAndFees) card, and the double cash card from citi. 

Basically the big difference between the two is the 0.5% cash back. I don't really spend much via credit, so I'm not sure if the 0.5% extra cash back is worth giving up the USAA bonuses I would get. While on active, so at least for the next 5 years, my USAA card would waive foreign transaction fees and cap my interest rate at 4%. Though I never plan to even get to that point. But from what I understand, the SCRA would also apply to the Citi card which should cap my interest with them at 6% while I'm on active. 

I want to start with a simple just cash back card to see how it goes, then add on a second card later with more specialized rewards perhaps. I use Ally for my savings and checking, but with USAA I could also open up a checking account through them.

Any suggestions or words of wisdom?

personalfinance,"27, married, new baby. How am I doing?","So my wife and I have a one-month old baby and I'm trying to see what our financial situation looks like and how I can improve it. I make about $75k a year after taxes and automatic contributions to my TSP account (paychecks are around $2900 twice a month plus a $5000 bonus annually). My month-to-month expenses look like this:

* Rent: $2400 (we live in Hawaii, this is an 800sqft apartment)
* Phone: $270 (my family shares my plan and pays me back about $150/mo)
* Auto/renters insurance: $120 (two cars, two drivers)
* Electric: $200
* Groceries: $400
* Car loan: $250 (8.24%, last payment is this month)
* Credit card: $200 (9.9%, last payment is this month and we don't regularly use it)
* Gas: $200
* Internet: $65
* My student loans: $100
* Wife's student loans: $150
* Netflix: $8

We *should* be saving money month-over-month but it seems like we don't really get ahead. I think a chunk of it comes from eating out (new baby leaves us exhausted) and there's more for the baby stuff like diapers.

I have an ""emergency fund"" savings account with about $7k in it that I transfer $250 to every paycheck, a TSP account worth around $30k that I contribute about 10% to, and a USAA Roth IRA with about $5k in it that I'm not currently contributing to.

With the baby coming and our current apartment getting a little cramped, we've decided to move since our lease expires at the end of this month anyways. The new place is much closer to work (10 minutes vs 30-35 minutes), is bigger than the old apartment, and is $2000 a month, so there's another $400 saved.

The next question is investments and debt and how I should be paying that off - my student loan is about $5500 with an interest rate of 5% and my wife has a total of around $13k with interest rates varying from 3.15% to 6.55%. The smallest amount is the one with the highest interest so I plan on making additional payments to get that one gone first. I want to start putting $400 a month into my USAA IRA and keep building up my savings account to $15-20k (it was up to $10k but I had to pull some money out to cover security deposit and other things involved with the new apartment).

worldpolitics,Seven Years After the Last Massive Wall Street Failure,"15 September 2015

The bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers seven years ago today signalled a breakdown of the global capitalist economy and financial system that continues to deepen.

Within hours of Lehman’s demise, it became clear this was not simply the failure of an individual bank, but the expression of a crisis engulfing the entire US and global financial system. At that point, US financial authorities stepped in to bail out American International Group (AIG), a transnational insurance giant that threatened to go under and take the entire American and world financial system with it.

This was the start of a process that has since seen central banks around the world continually increase the supply of ultra-cheap money—the US Federal Reserve alone has pumped out more than $4 trillion—to finance the speculation and parasitism of the banks and finance houses. These measures have done nothing to alleviate the crisis. On the contrary, they have created the conditions for another disaster.

This is evidenced by the recent violent fluctuations on financial and currency markets, including the fall of the Chinese stock market and collapse of some emerging market currencies in South East Asia to their lowest point since the Asian crisis of 1997–98.

Issuing the latest quarterly review of the Bank for International Settlements at the weekend, the bank’s chief economist, Claudio Borio, noted that “debt levels are too high, productivity growth too weak and financial risks too threatening.” Referring to the most recent market turbulence, he warned: “We are not seeing isolated tremors, but the release of pressure that has gradually accumulated over years along major fault lines.”

Not only have none of the underlying contradictions that led to the crisis of 2008 been overcome, the very measures adopted over the past seven years have intensified them.

Parasitism—the accumulation of wealth through financial market speculation completely unrelated to productive activity, and, indeed, inimical to it—has grown to unprecedented heights, while the real economy has stagnated.

Economic output in Europe, one of the central components of the global economy, has still not returned to the levels it attained in 2007. And, as the International Monetary Fund and other major economic bodies have pointed out, investment levels in the major capitalist countries—the key driver of the real economy—are at least 25 percent below pre-crisis levels, with no prospect of revival.

At the same time, Chinese economic growth is falling while so-called emerging markets, once held out as a new basis for global capitalist expansion, are experiencing lower growth or outright contraction amid fears of a major financial crisis if interest rates in the US begin to rise.

One day after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a socialist web site spelled out its implications in an analysis that has in the intervening period been fully confirmed: “A sea change is unfolding in the US and world economy that portends a catastrophe of dimensions not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s … These events are signposts in the historic failure of American and world capitalism. For the working class, they mean a rapid growth of unemployment, poverty, homelessness and social misery.”

In the immediate aftermath of the collapse, the leaders of the major capitalist powers pledged cooperation and collaboration as they tackled the crisis. Those commitments have long gone by the board, replaced by intensifying conflicts over control of markets, competitive currency devaluations and divergent policy measures.

As in the Depression of the 1930s, the capitalist breakdown has fuelled the drive to war in every part of the world. American imperialism, under the Obama administration, has intensified the drive to bring the vast Eurasian landmass and its economic resources under its control, launching a series of provocations against Russia in the West and making preparations for war against China in the East under the so-called “pivot to Asia.”

German imperialism has initiated a campaign to reassert its position as a global power, while the Japanese government of Prime Minister Abe is moving to do away with restrictions on military activity imposed under the post-war constitution.

In every country, the term “austerity” has become a by-word for deepening attacks on the working class amid rising inequality and social misery. As the wealth of the upper layers increases, wages decline and health care, education and other basic social services are targeted for endless cuts.

The bogus “war on terror” has become the justification for the shredding of fundamental democratic rights and the development of ever more authoritarian forms of rule. This is one of the clearest indications that the ruling classes themselves know they have no solution to the economic breakdown and are preparing to meet the social struggles it must produce with mass repression.

The past seven years of economic breakdown, coupled with the threat of world war, growing repression and poverty, and the creation of the largest number of refugees since World War II, testify to the historic bankruptcy of the capitalist system. That understanding must form the basis for the development of a political struggle of the international working class against war and in defence of social and democratic rights against the financial elites and their governments.",finance,1442316481

personalfinance,Experian - question about massive credit score discrepancy,"Hi PF. I am scratching my head over this.

I've been trying to clean up my credit the past few months. I've successfully removed a few collections, gotten a secured card that I'm using responsibly, and only had a couple inquires (mostly because I moved and was required to get them for utilities, rental app, etc.). On Credit Karma, which uses the Vantage Score 3.0 scoring method, my score has gone up over 30 points to 630. I am thrilled because with a few more months of responsible card use, I'm hoping I can get my score closer to where it needs to be to buy a house. (FWIW, I've learned a TON about my past credit mistakes and absolutely do not want to repeat them.)

In the process of moving I did do one unnecessary inquiry at a furniture store, because they sell it as part of a ""help build your credit"" scenario and I knew anything I would buy, I could pay off in the short term. I ended up getting denied. No big deal, it didn't show up on Equifax or Transunion, and I don't really need it. Then yesterday I get the denial explanation in the mail, and it says my score with Experian is 552! 

First of all, my score with Experian was higher than that BEFORE I started cleaning up my credit. Second, an 80 point difference seems extreme when, according to the Experian website, they use Vantage Score 3.0 scoring -- and my report with them doesn't look any different than my TransUnion report.

I had to drop out in January due to financial and personal hardships (mostly because I owed the university ~$4000) and long story short, I ended up taking a full year off. I've started receiving bills for Federal loans, which I cannot afford to pay. I have reluctantly agreed to take a loan from a family member to settle my debt with the university and a credit card (total of about $5800), for which I will be repaying $400 a month for the next 15 months. I decided to take the money from a family member so I can go back to school in January, and finish my degree (I'm at 100 semester hours of 120). Here are my main questions/concerns:

-Is there a way to have my federal/private loans deferred since I am going back to school in January?

-How do I go about getting back into school since I didn't really file any paperwork or anything to let them know I was taking a year off? I think as far as the school is concerned I've dropped out.

-For the credit card debt in collections (~$1500 between 3 CAs) I'm going to request a ""pay for delete"" and pay the amounts in full, following [this letter](http://credit.about.com/od/debtcollection/a/payfordelete.htm) and the information in the sidebar. Is there anything I need to watch out for or do you have any suggestions? 

-17 out of the remaining 20 semester hours are gen eds and I'd like to take some or all of them at a community college nearby, how do I make sure the credits will actually transfer? I've heard so many stories of people who take community college courses then go to a 4 year state school and few/none of their credits transfer over.

-I think my credit has dropped below 650, how hard will it be to get a car loan? My car is on its last life (almost as old as me...) and I don't think it will last through the winter. With my current budget, including the $400 payment to the family member, I can afford ~$150-200 per month car payment, however I don't have any money to put down. Am I SOL?

1) Conventional mortgage, which would include PMI

2) LPMI, which would have a slightly higher interest rate but no PMI

3) Combo Loan, which would be 80% first mortgage, 15% down payment, and 5% home equity loan to cover the remainder

In my mind, the combo loan appears to be the best way to handle this, as we can just devote all extra cash to paying down the home equity loan ASAP.  It seems better than trying to do the same thing but with PMI (which would eat into the cash we could apply to principal as well as the fact that PMI isn't tax deductible).

Am I missing any glaring negatives here?  What are the major risks with this?  To me, it seems like the benefit very much outweighs any drawbacks...or am I wrong?",finance,1442339310

Trade it in for something newer/more reliable, or continuing repairing and pay off/own the car in 3.5 more years? I don't have anyone really to ask... A bad move on my part.","Hi everyone,

I bought my first non-Craigslist car, a 2005 Honda Civic SI with 79,000 miles on it, from a Honda dealer back in February 2013 for $10,000 + taxes, fees, a shitty warranty that I wish I did not purchase, etc. Everything came out to around $15,000. I put $5,000 down and financed the other $10,000 over the course of 5 years at a 10.9% interest rate. My monthly payment is around $240. 

Prior to this I owned a 2003 Toyota Matrix XR which I paid cash for an owned. I should have kept this. 

My Civic so far, over the past year, has cost me almost $2,500 in repairs. I've replaced the fuel pump, knock sensor (happening now), rotors, brakes, belts, rack and pinion, and the clutch now has about 107,000 miles on it and is starting to slip pretty bad. It is in the shop as we speak having the knock sensor replaced, and there is also a moaning/squeaking noise when I come out of first gear that I'm sure will be another problem. I feel like the car is going to continue breaking down and unfortunately my warranty does not cover any of this since it is considered ""normal wear"" on the car. 

I think that money could have gone towards payments and I feel kind of dumb for even buying the car (still completely stock, but I wanted something faster than my Martix (idiot move)). My question comes to this. Should I trade it in for something newer (I have pretty good credit of about 750) or pay off the remaining $7,500 I have left and then own the car while I continue to pay for repairs? 

tl;dr: Overpaid for a car that is now costing me lots in repairs. Should I trade it in and get something newer/more reliable or continue to fix it and pay it off?

personalfinance,Should I hire a professional money manager given my situation?,"I am comfortable managing money, and believe I have done a reasonable job of it so far, but am wondering if given our situation outlined below, I would benefit from hiring a money manager.  

Our current situation:

* Married with 2 kids (almost 6 and almost 2), both of us work full time 
* Both of us are in a low 40s
* Combined yearly income ~$280k pre-tax, split ~50/50 between us
* Spouse's job very stable, mine fairly stable and marketable (software engineer/product manager)
* Own a home now worth ~$1.7 million (paid ~$1 million about 4.5 years ago), with 2 mortgages totaling about $770k at good rates (refinanced both recently). Current market is very high in the SF area at the moment, so we could be in for a correction soon, though we have no plans to sell.
* Monthly mortgage payments with tax and insurance are ~$5800.  
* Older kid in after school care ($560/month), younger kid in full-time day care ($2k/month) ... welcome to the SF area ...
* Two cars, one bought in 2012 and all paid off, the other bought this year, and owing ~$24k on it ($540/month payment).
* Cash accounts (both of us): ~$50k (savings/checking emergency funds)
* Retirement account balances (both of us): ~$620k, (403bs and 401ks that were rolled into traditional IRAs, both contributing currently and getting max employer match)
* Non-retirement investment account balances (both of us): ~$450k (virtually all in a mixture of mutual funds from T Rowe Price and TIAA-CREF, a few thousand in individual ""safe"" stocks like GE and MSFT)
* College savings: ~$60k between the 2 kids (adding ~$800 each month between the 2)
* Auto-investing into mutual funds twice a month (~$600/month)
* Life insurance: ~$1 million for each of us
* Biggest expenses are mortgage, daycare, after school care, groceries, insurance and household bills.  We don't eat out much (see 2 young kids above) nor have any expensive hobbies, which is why we were and are able to save so much.
* All of this works out to a rough net worth of ~$1.8 million (a significant fraction of this is in the recent run up in house prices though)

The stock mutual funds are mixed between growth, value, and various capitalizations (small, mid, large).  I do have one International stock fund, but most are domestic focused. The bond funds are auto-asset allocation types (there a couple, representing various levels of short-long term).  The retirement funds are in target-retirement year funds (Fidelity and TIAA-CREF) that auto-balance. While not the lowest cost funds out there (e.g. index funds), T Rowe Price and TIAA-CREF have lower than average rates, and none are higher than ~0.8% nor have any other fees.   

Basically, my strategy is to be sure I don't carry too much in cash and periodically look at the mix of mutual funds to be sure the balance is reasonable for our ages (currently ~75% stocks, ~25% bonds).
We used some of the mutual fund savings to buy the cars recently and do some home improvements, but due to low interest rates, didn't pay all cash for the cars.  (Before I finally bought a new car this year, I had been driving the same car since 2000!)  We basically just keep investing whatever we don't spend, and don't watch the jabbering heads on financial news (which has turned out to be a very good strategy even given all of the ups and downs of the last 10 years).

So the question is: what would I get from a professional money manager other than giving him/her 1% of my invested savings each year?  I am not trying to be glib, but just curious what specific value I would likely derive.

EDIT: The ""1%"" figure in the sentence above was not meant to be specific - I actually do not know how much financial advisers typically charge for someone in our position.",finance,1442348430

Do I go with a balance transfer or personal loan?,"So quick background, grew up never knowing really how to manage money at all and stupidly used a Credit Card to help pay for college.  Now Im stuck with high balance credit card with a high interest rate.

Last year, I finally sat down and did a budget that I can follow and started to seriously look on how to pay down my debts.  My Discover card at the time had a 15K balance.  What discover did was set me on a 0%Apr for new purchases.  For 2-3 months I charged everything on my card and paid that amount off, basically making my whole 15k balance a ""new"" purchase at 0%.  

Now that promotion ends in November (Balance needs to be paid by November 11th) and I still have 13K on it.  So I though about going with a 0% APR card with balance transfers (The Citi Simplicity is having a promotion for 0% for 21months, with a 3% charge on the balance).  I was approved for $4,500...not enough to cover it all.

Other option I was thinking was a personal loan, but rates arent too good.... or should I just transfer $4500 to the citi card and get hit with the APR for the remainder of the balance on the Discover?  I have about $500 a month set aside now to tackle this debt.",finance,1442348692

The private loans I have are rather different in interest rates, and the main difference between them is only that two were co-signed by one acquaintance, and 2 were co-signed by another acquaintance (call them A and B).

&amp;nbsp;

*The two loans from co-signer ""A"" have 10.24% (Wells Fargo) and 11.00%(Sallie Mae/Navient) interest rates.

*The two loans from co-signer ""B"" have 3.41% (Great Lakes) and 3.45% (Firstmark) interest rates.

&amp;nbsp;

I tried earlier this year to consolidate the two high interest rate loans but failed because I could not find a qualified co-signer for the consolidation.  Recently, some things have changed and co-signer ""B"" agreed to co-sign on the consolidated loan as well (this person has essentially perfect credit and financial history).  I have been given an offer from Wells Fargo (with the co-signer) for consolidation of the two loans with either a 4.99% variable interest rate, or an 8.27% fixed interest rate.

&amp;nbsp;

My plan is to over-pay the consolidated loan first (since it will be the largest loan I have) at an accelerated rate to pay it off as fast as is financially feasible.

&amp;nbsp;

The question is, do I risk the variable interest rate since I will be over-paying, or should I just go with the fixed interest rate to guarantee it doesn't ever spike?  Or, in other words, how much and how often do these variable interest rates usually change?  Does Wells Fargo have a history of drastically changing the variable interest rates unexpectedly?

When I buy a fucking computer, I can track its trip from China, up to Alaska, down to LA, when it arrives at my local FedEx facility, when it leaves the fed ex facility, and when its delivered... Why aren't we using this technology to see when students arrive and leave school? Or something like it. Every student has a student ID, why don't all buses have a place to swiped card when you enter the bus, and/or exit, and then when you arrive to class you swipe it to check in for class. Save the teacher the time to call roll because its all tracked in a database. And then there's someone in the audience that when a student didn't check in for a class, a red flag goes off and they can be searched for.

If Paul didn't check at his first class, the person who gets those red flags about students who didn't check into their next class could have looked him up and seen that he never got off the bus. Or something like that.

I realize it's a little overkill, but as a soon to be parent, I wouldn't be upset if a school called me and said, ""JDBrew, your daughter was here for first and second period, but third period started 10 minutes ago and we don't show her as checked in anywhere. Did you come pick her up?"" If the answer is no, this type of early warning could be the difference in catching a kidnapper who's only a 10 minute drive away, versus, a 6 hour gap. Or it could be that she ditched to go smoke pot with her friends, which if this means she gets caught ditching, Good! 

Now the former highschooler in me says ""Fuck that, that would be awful, being tracked down and monitored all day"" but the parent side of me says this could save lives. 

You could take it a step further. When you have divorced parents and one picks up the child when they weren't supposed to. The parents could have a way of checking the student out. Then you have documented proof that a parent without custody took your child. 

In the case of Paul Lee, it would have saved his life. And I'm sure there are other cases where this could have saved a life.

That got me thinking about how this could possibly work in real life.  Say a currency was developed specifically to ""pay"" what would otherwise be unpaid volunteer positions.  I'm thinking that you get one coin for every hour you're putting in work, which in theory would tie the value of the coins to the federal minimum wage (if not more) for exchange purposes.  So it'd be a currency based on the value of the working hour as opposed to other factors such as cost of living.

Say some organization took it upon themselves to be the ones who produced and distributed these coins.  What are the barriers present that would prevent or impede acceptance of this currency in various stores across the U.S. (and worldwide)?

It would be really cool if we could profit from volunteering.  It always seems like volunteers are needed here and there and this would increase participation.  But I feel like there are 4000 reasons why this just wouldn't work.  Please discuss below, and thank you for reading.",finance,1442377201

Question regarding myth 2

 So, what has kept rates low? At the risk of rehashing a graph that I have used multiple times, it is far simpler and more fundamental, and it lies in the Fisher equation, which decomposes the nominal interest rate into its expected inflation and real interest rate components:

Nominal Interest Rate = Expected Inflation + Expected Real Interest Rate

If you make the assumption that in the long term, the real interest rate in an economy converges on real growth rate, you have an equation for what I call an intrinsic risk free rate.  In the graph below, [I graph out the actual US 10-year treasury](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Xikp4xTuQI/VeeHCtbQp8I/AAAAAAAACmo/VZNbLTg0S0Y/s1600/Int%2Brates%2Band%2BFed%2BEffect.jpg) bond rate against this intrinsic risk free rate and you can make your own judgment on why rates have been low for the last five years.

This group is a bit confusing and I'm having trouble interpreting it, it being small doesn't help. What does he mean the ""intrinsic rate"" what is this set by? I'm assuming it's the rate without the effect of inflation, and I've done this...but The intrinsic rate+inflation rate should equal the bond rate, but it doesn't in the last row. why? What exactly is that table trying to saw because I'm having issues analyzing it. 

how is the tbond rate, inflation, real gdp, value, and the difference related according to damodaran?

The table on the right is equally confusing, if someone can explain it, I'd appreciate it. 

And from myth 3

personalfinance,Saving with an atypical 401k,"Hello PF,

Most advice says to max out your 401k contributions to whatever your employer will match and then take any additional money/savings and invest/save it elsewhere. Well, my company gives you 10% of your salary into your 401k regardless of what you do. Contribute anywhere from $0 to $10000, you get 10% from them. So, my question is, how much (if any) should I be contributing to my 401k? And what's my best option for saving the rest of it? For reference, I'm 22 and my salary is $50k and I'm fully vested in my 401k from the start.

Also, as far as savings, I've been looking at the Barclay's Dream Account. I'm a little unclear on exactly how the bonuses work though, here's the copy pasta from their site:

&gt;Every time you make consecutive deposits for six months, we’ll give you a 2.5% bonus on the past six months of interest earned
Make no withdrawals for six consecutive months and earn another 2.5% bonus on the past six months of interest earned

Mathematically, how does this work out? For example, if I have $1000 in the account, assuming I check both bonuses, what would my account be at after 6mo (assuming no additional contributions, which would not be the case)? And if I was contributing $500/mo? Basically, what is the formula here? And is there any reason not to go with this account?

My fiance &amp; I have joint finances, his salary is the same as mine, though his 401k is more traditional. We have ~$1.2k every month that we can squirrel away, our income is ~$6k/mo after taxes. We'd like to purchase a house next year or so as well.

EDIT: The Barclay base interest rate is 1.05% APY which is just a smidge higher than the 1.00% I get at my credit union currently",finance,1442414825

I'm a 23 year old chemical engineer who is considering a transition to med school. My timeline would have me starting in about 2 years and I'm trying to consider the best financial plan during that time. Please review my plan below and offer any suggestions. I also have a few questions. 

- continue to max retirement account (401k and Roth IRA)
- store away excess savings into high yield savings/CDs/or short term bonds due to short time horizon

I foresee having 50-75k cash by the time med school would start (or more if I have to apply again, but I can keep working until med school starts since I don't need to go back to school) 

A few questions/concerns:

-I know that the FAFSA overlooks retirement accounts when calculating EFC, but I'm wondering if having 75k+ cash would eliminate my chance of getting aid. I don't think med school students are eligible for grants, but my understanding is that there are beneficial ways to pay off federal loans that could make them cheaper than they nominally appear to be (currently around 6.5%), and I would like to have the opportunity to accept them. 

-If I decided I wanted loans and therefore put my money in something like a taxable stock index fund then am I at risk of being forced to liquidate in a market downturn by being denied access to loans

-I have good credit and for example Discover has variable rate loans as low as 3%. Are those ever a good idea? 

-If the FAFSA would deny loans at the amount of cash I anticipate would buying a property be penny wise and pound foolish since the FAFSA neglects primary residence in calculations as well?

Hi all! I am returning for a mini update and question regarding possible retirement. I have purposefully linked my previous post as it contains my budget and expenses, which haven't changed significantly.   

**My update** This summer I had many unexpected (let's be honest *UNWANTED*) expenses which drastically slowed and cut my emergency savings account. Including $1100 to replace all tires and front breaks, plus an alignment for my car. I'm currently working on getting it back up to the 4 month worth of expenses (roughly $5000).    

**Now on to my question:**     

In November, I will be required to pay into my employer's 401 (a) retirement plan. I am not sure if it's possible to not participate under certain circumstances. If I do have the option to opt out/in, **is it more financially sound to focus on paying off my student loan debt than to pay into retirement?** I am hoping to use the knowledge you all provide to a) help make a case to my employer should it be beneficial to pay off my loans first and not contribute to retirement or b) make an informed decision on choosing the correct retirement plan, given my financial state.          

A few items to consider (please refer to my budget in my original post for details):   
*$85,000 in private student loans (unforgivable, split between six different loans, interest rates vary between loans 4.4% and 8.5%)     
*$84,000 in federal loans (forgivable in roughly 7 years)   
*Monthly income $2450 

**401(a) Retirement Options**   


*Tier 1 Employee Contribution* 3%+ Employer Match 6.5%=Total 10%   
*Tier 2 Employee Contribution* 5.5%+ Employer Match 8%= Total 13.5%    

I spoke briefly to a representative from the retirement company that my employer works with who recommended (without knowing my specific situation) contributing to a separate 403(b) because it is possible to contribute as little as $10/month. *Is this possible?* I always assumed a person had to contribute minimums or at least put a lump sum in? If I can get out of the employer match program--is a 403(b) something practical to consider because it's what I can afford?

personalfinance,Is it possible to have my university balance bought by Navient?,"I left the university 3 years ago with about half a degree completed and an outstanding balance of $817.65. I also have $6-7k in loans through Navient. So far, I have paid none of that back (yes, I know) and just applied through Navient for a Pay As You Earn plan for the loans.

Is it possible to have Navient buy my university balance and consolidate it with one of my two federal Navient loans?

I would ideally just pay off the university balance after dealing with our $1,000 CC debt, but I'm hoping to go back to school ASAP (spring 2016) and need my transcripts transferred from my old school.

personalfinance,"Lots of decisions to make. Buying vs Renting, credit, paying off debt.","My mother has been living with us for 2 years as she is in poor health. It’s time to make the move to assisted living. We moved to a larger house to make room for her and have been renting here. We use some of her SS income to help pay rent as we could not afford (nor would we need) this monster house without her. She wanted her own bedroom, living space, etc so it had to be large. Now that we are moving her to assisted living, we are also face with needing to move ourselves. We cannot afford the current house on our own, nor do we need all this extra space. This is bringing up a lot of questions/financial decisions for us.

A look at our financial picture:

We’re in our late 20’s/early 30’s, both have bachelor’s degrees and we have a 2 year old.

Mine/Husband’s income: $71k/yr gross. Our take-home is around $3882/mo after taxes and insurance. (I make $51k/yr and he makes $11/hr at about 38 hrs/week – translates to about $20k/yr) *He is looking for a better, salaried job – this could probably net him another $10k/yr or a little more, but I’m only including our current situation for planning*

Debt: $59k of mostly student loans – The monthly payments total about $1150/mo. Making mostly minimum payments, although I’ve started a tiny debt reduction snowball (only an extra $100/mo).

Monthly Expenses: Mainly Rent/Utilities ($750 rent + $200-250 utilities), Food (~$450-500 for 3 adults and 1 ravenous toddler), Daycare for 1 child ($660). That leaves us with about $600 left. It varies but I rarely have more than $200 left over at the end of the month after diapers, gas for the cars, household supplies, things that come up like needing oil changes or replacing tires, etc.

4 Questions which I will elaborate on below: 

* Do we try to rent again, or buy? Is the one I am having the most difficulty with as I have zero experience with buying a home.

* Do I pay off an account I just noticed in collections? How will that help my credit and is it worth draining my HSA account to do it? Would I have to pay it off in order to qualify for a mortgage?

* Any advice on tackling the debt better than we are? At this rate, paying an extra $100/mo, it will all be paid off in 5 years. Would buying or renting be more helpful in paying down said debt? Should I just give up thinking about buying a home until we have everything paid off?

* If right now looks like a bad time for us to buy, do you have any advice on how we can position ourselves to be ready in the future?

I’ve looked into home prices in our area and mortgage rates and man, it’s really tempting to want to buy since we could have a decent 2-3br house for ~$90-110k, interest rates seem really low right now, and our monthly payments would almost be cut in half if we did a 30 year fixed mortgage. I could, combining tax returns and family assistance, probably come up with a $5-6k downpayment by next spring. Not great but not terrible. I hate putting that $750 into somebody else’s equity every single month. It weighs on me and just feels like lost money. It’s also a matter of not being able to find a suitable home to rent in a safe part of town without trying to stretch our budget even further. We love putting time and effort into maintaining our home, but I do worry about something really expensive going wrong where we don’t have the money to fix it. When you own your home, ideally how much do you need to have in savings just for the home in case things break? If our mortgage/insurance/taxes were less than what we are currently paying in rent, ideally that extra $ could just be put into savings for future repairs. Is this incredibly naïve? It sounds like it just typing it out. But how do people get out of renting and start building equity when they don’t have a lot of disposable income? I want a safe and stable place to raise my family. I am tired of needing to move and being at the whims of other people. I really want to own my home.

As for the account in collections: In looking into all our finances, I took a look at my credit report and it looks like one of the hospital bills from our daughter’s birth never made it to our new address (we moved right after we had her). Everything else is taken care of, but we somehow missed this one bill and it’s been moved into collections. About $1500 which I have saved up in my HSA and could easily pay off now. Except….the damage is done to my credit at this point. Do I drain my HSA to pay it off and leave us at risk if someone in the family has an accident or health crisis (or heaven forbid, I have another baby)? Does it even matter? This sounds kind of morally questionable to me to just not pay debt that I owe, but if it won’t help my credit, I have to ask why, logically, I should.

Any advice on any of these points would be super helpful. I feel like I am in a little over my head and am just trying to make the best decision for my family. My parents are terrible at managing money and only taught me bad habits, so they are no help.

personalfinance,Choosing an investment gift for a young child,"A friend of the family has a son who is about to turn 1, and the family does not have much in the way of savings.  I would like to put aside a modest amount (say, a few hundred dollars) into a long-term investment gift for their son, in the form of something like a bond.  Here is basically what I'm looking for:

- I'd like it to be a long-term investment, for when he turns 18 or so.  Any tax-advantaged status if it's put towards something like education would be appreciated.

- I'd like it to have a decent rate of return.  Series I and EE bonds are returning practically nothing right now.  Giving a gift with an interest rate of less than 1% seems ridiculous.

- I'd like it to have some kind of physical component that I can put inside a card.  Starting a 529 plan as a birthday gift seems oddly impersonal since I'd have nothing to show for it.

Mortgage refinancing.

Loan amount: 50000

Settlement charges: 6000

Total disbursements to others: 40000

Total disbursements to mortgagee: 4000

Interest rate: 13%

My understanding is that the APR would be...

($50,000 * .13) = $6,500

$6,500/(loan amount minus fees, or $44000) = 14.77%

Is that correct?

With my purchase of a car i will be driving part time on the weekends for Uber to make some extra cash. Also i know my GF would be more than willing to cosign a loan for me but i am adamantly against it. it will need to be something between 2004ish and 2007ish but thats not really all that important in this post. 

the reason i have decided to post here is that i was checking credit karma and noticed they recommended a personal loan to consolidate debt. i did a bit of research but i am not sure if this is the right approach for me. i do plan on going to my bank (Chase) and speaking with someone there to gain some additional advice. 

my question boils down to this, should i try to acquire a personal loan to eliminate my debt both credit card and motorcycle loan (and then ditch bike for approximately $4,000), then use anything i have left over to help fund a vehicle purchase? my credit scores at the moment are right around the 710 mark but i fear with my lower annual income i wont get approved for much of a loan. credit karma states that my average interest rate between my three loans is in the 12.99% range so i feel if i can get all this consolidated into somewhere near the 5-7% range that would be much better for my financial standings as well as boost my credit score with a lower credit utilization (please please please correct me if im wrong, i am sort of new to credit scores even though my history is about 3.75 years old and i feel im obsessing over it a bit much.

A few days ago, Destiny: The Taken King, an update/expansion to Destiny was released updating all sorts of stuff, including the levelling system, the menus, quests, ghost shells, etc. I've been super hypes about it for ages now, since it was announced because I **LOVE** Destiny. 

I love Destiny enough that before the DLCs were released I bought the Season Pass so I could just start playing all the expansions as they were released. It was great! The Dark Below came out, loved it. House of Wolves came out, loved it more than the first DLC. Then they announced The Taken King and all the new features it would implement and I got HYPED. 

That was until today. I turned on my PS4 and saw a new logo and let out a ""ooohh..."" boot up Destiny, it does a little update, and I jump to the tower. New quests! ""Go kill people in Control in the Crucible"" Ugh. I hate PvP, but whatever. Jump to space select the Crucible -&gt; Control.

""You need The Taken King""

***WHAT***

But I have the season pass. huh? 

I jump on to twitter to find out what's up and am immediately told that THIS DLC IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SEASON PASS

Let me say that again

THE SEASON PASS DOESN'T MEAN SHIT ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY CAN.

~~I was looking around the new interfaces and saw that my 365 defense chestplate is now 170 defense.~~ ~~~~(Edit: okay, I've been corrected on this point)

I was promised that I would get *all* future expansions if I basically preordered them but apparently that only extends to some arbitrary point where Bungie decided ""We need more money""

They paywalled things I could previously do, plastered the environment with TAKEN KING ONLY content, ~~and nerfed my equipment~~, simply because they want to twist my arm into paying more. 

Cunts, the lot of 'em.

Am I the only one who finds this a GROSS misuse of power? A big, greedy cash-grab? Seriously. 

What.. The.. Fuck?

TL;DR Destiny season pass isn't a season pass AND Bungie paywalled previously available content.

Edit: I just stopped into EBGames to pay for Destiny FOR THE THIRD TIME and they told me this expansion is $70.  That is a disgusting amount of money. I am not paying for it. 

One of my favourite games of all time and I simply cannot play it anymore.

I currently have an unbalanced portfolio with 4 stocks:
AAPL 85.7%
FB 6.9%
JBLU 4.7%
GILD 2.7%

I plan to sell 20% of my position in AAPL, not because I dislike the stock (I work there and drink the Kool-Aid), but because I'm up 115% and I need to ring the register. I will also remove my position in GILD. I've heard that bio-stocks are expected to get hit hard from this rate hike. FB and JBLU I plan to hold for the time being.

personalfinance,"I would like to buy a house in Portland in a year, is it a good idea and how can I get there?","About me: 
I just started working a few months ago. My monthly expenses are about 1800$ (500 rent, 350 car payment, 150 car insurance, 800 food, social life, gas, etc.) leaving about 1200$ over/ month. My company provides a 50% match on 401k contributions up to the federal maximum (about 2 more years until I vest). I have about 2k saved up. I can begin contributing to my 401k on my next pay check and have it set up to pay out 35% of my pay check into a  traditional IRA. I currently live and work in Washington (no state income taxes). Additionally, I can expect to get a bonus of about 5k during the year (which I am contributing 75% to my 401k). I won't use bonus in my calculations to keep things conservative. 

Once I start contributing I basically will save nothing. However, I do know that I can use 10k from my 401k for a house down payment. 

In a year I should have contributed roughly 15,960$ (Traditional IRA so pre tax take home contribution of roughly 1330/month). My companies match will take me up 23,940 + whatever gains the stock market has brought. 

Ideally I would like to buy a 3 bedroom house in portland and rent out the other two rooms to pay for my mortgage (and maybe more). However, I would have to start paying income taxes and in the short run I would miss out on maxing out my companies match. 

I would prefer to live in Portland rather than Washington and I also believe that the Portland housing market will boom. 

What advice do you guy have? Is this a viable/smart option? What should I look out for/be concerned about? Would it be wise to contribute a little less so I could have an additional 5k or so to have a 15k down payment?",finance,1442464279

personalfinance,Overpaid loan will I get money back?,"I made a check out for the last deffered downpayment on the vehicle. My grandma who found out I have no credit ( i'm 23) and found out my interest rate she took me to refinance it through her bank. 8 days after the check was sent. (I will now pay less a month and will only pay 1100 in interest instead of 5000.)



I called the place that originally finaced me. Told them the check from the bank for the full amount including the 250 they had yet to recieve was in the mail. They said they would put a note on the account to hold my original check for a week once they recieved it to make sure the pay off check came in. When I called on Monday they still hadn't got my check. For fear it was lost in the mail I had my grandmas bank add it to the loan.



They cashed it right at closing today. Needless to say I am calling in the morning. Last time I sent the check it got recieved and cahshed within 4 days of me mailing it. I'm glad to be done with this company. They have told me so many conflicting things. I am also worried about them trying to pull the money out of my account next Friday. It was set up to come out automatically after the last deffered down payment. 


Can anyone enlighten me or put my mind at ease? If they don't get me my money back can I do anything and if I can get my money back does anyone know how long it will take? I'm stresseing out.",finance,1442468094

personalfinance,"I have managed to run myself and mywife into debt, and I am afraid if I don't make a change now, I will be divorced. I am ready to make a change. Please help me.","So after many months of beating around the bush, it was made clear by my wife of 5 years (as of this October) that I am solely responsible for our bad financial situation, and how irresponsible I am with my money/debt. For anyone who truly cares, I would provide some insight into our situation.

Growing up, I never really thought too much about debt. I had a Southwestern Bell telephone that I let get charged off, and then my electric service, and cell phone, and etc. I was, and have always been carefree in regards to my debt. I always assumed that if I ignored it, that it would go away. Some of it has, others have not. When I met my wife, she had great credit. She was very proud of her credit score, and worked hard to get it to where it was. Eventually when we moved in together, she had to put everything in her name because I crapped all over my credit and had debt that prevented me from having the electric, phones, or water service in my name. She did it all, putting it in her name. Since the inception of our relationship, this has been pretty much status quo. When we got our new car, it was done in her name. She opened a couple of credit cards under her name, and we kind of got out of hand with them, maxing them out in a few months. Pretty much everything is in my wife's name. Now I fully accept that I am a piece of garbage. I have been taking advantage of the woman that I love, and allowing her to suffer the consequences. I know how much stress this is causing her, and I can't see her like that. I need to do my part, and make this right.

Fast forward 10 years to today, and we have been married for 5 years. We have a 7 year old daughter, and we are struggling even more. We still have a lot of credit card debt, medical bills, and we are always paying our bills a month behind. Our car had some mechanical issues, and that put us back $500. When configuring our finances last nite, my wife finally hit a breaking point. She went over everything and noticed a trend. Every bill I have, I rip up and throw away. It's all about out of sight out of mind. No trouble if I don't see it. I have managed to ignore every financial responsibility that I have, like I don't care. But there's that underlying fear that I know something bad is brewing. I know there is trouble. People have gotten crapped on for a lot worse. I don't want it to get to that point.

 I am a delivery driver, and she is a social worker. She averages around $1100 every two weeks, and I average around $700-1000 every two weeks, the higher being if I obviously had a good two weeks of deliveries which is possible. Her checks come in on the 1st and 15th of every month, and her checks pretty much immediately go towards bills. Since I make cash when I work, we spend my money for casual things like eating out, shopping for groceries and household items, and other things we might need or want to go do. In an effort to try and resolve this, I mentioned the possibility of filing bankruptcy, and she became upset. It is not an option for her. She says it's stupid, and it hurts you worse than it helps you. She has always been good about paying what she owes, and takes pride in it. I wish I was like that. I NEED to be more like that. I HAVE to get that mentality if I want to save our marriage. As of tonight I began turning off things we can do without (Netflix, Hulu, etc). So far I have saved us $20 as of tonight in monthly costs.

I am considering consulting a debt consolidation company in regards to getting myself back on track, but have absolutely no info about whether they are good or bad, and if they are rip offs and such. I took sometime this evening to reflect on my bad habits, and I know I have a problem. My mother is the exact same kind of person I am. When she gets money, it burns a whole in her pocket. My parents just recently filed for bankruptcy themselves. I can tell this has created a huge rift between my wife and I. I don't want to be another statistic. In all honesty, we don't fight or argue at all unless it's about money or bills. I want to become a better person financially and own up to my debt, get it paid and get my life financially out of the gutter. I want to have money in my own bank account so when we have car issues, I don't have to scramble and freak out about where I am going to get the money to fix it. I am 33 years old, my wife is 29, we need this to be fixed so we can begin saving our marriage, and prepare for our future.

I am willing to provide any information I can to you guys in detail if you are genuinely interested in offering advice, or recommending anything I can do. 

A few things: 

We own a house (are actively paying a mortgage)
we own two vehicles (one is paid, other has 1 more year left of payments)
I have credit card debt that I have not paid in 6 months
We both have student loans that we are behind on, some of hers are under forbearance to allow us to pay other debt.
She has 3 credit cards with debt on it (Wal-mart Credit Card, Best Buy Credit Card, and CareCredit)
We have various medical bills in our names with outstanding debt
We are a month behind on most of our monthly bills (internet, water, electricity,) 
We manage to pay our house and car payments on time every month, because they are the most important things and come out on the 1st and 15th when she is paid.

EDIT #1: The amount of responses I awoke to were amazing. There are a lot of great people on this sub and I am overwhelmed with support. Thank you all so much. Now, for those asking, here is a breakdown of our monthly expenses (what we currently pay on AVERAGE). The credit card payments for $25.00 are minimum payments.

* Mortgage: $556.50
* Car: $275.00
* Care Credit: $32.00
* Water/Sewage-$70.00
* Electric-$300
* Best Buy CC- $25.00
* Plaza Tire CC-$25.00
* Internet-$45.00
* Walmart CC-$25.00
* Cell Phone-$73.37
* Lunch Money for child at school-$40
* ADT Security System-$40 
* Automobile Insurance-$100
* (we did have Netflix and Hulu but I cancelled those last night saving us $20 a month)
* Gas- $200-$300 a month
* Groceries- $250-300

EDIT #2 I am beginning to compile all of our current debt. This may take a while! Please be patient!

OUR DEBT

* Plaza Tire- Total owed is $818.17 (INTEREST- Yearly 22.8%, Monthly 1.9%)
* Hospital Bill 1-$102.50 
* Hospital Bill 2- $92.07
* Radiology Bill- $13.82
* Credit Card 1- $412.12
* Lab and Pathology Bill- $18.55
* Wal-Mart CC- $1,474.49 (Interest rate-(9.0 apr, we got into a customer assistance program. It ends in October. they tell us they cannot tell us what it will go up to until the program ends. I don't know if I got a lazy worker, or if she was being honest)
* Surgery Bill- $285.30
* Hospital Bill 3- $19.52
* Imaging Bill (medical)- $78.63

* Her Student Loan Debt 3- $26,958.27
* Care Credit- $1,105.66
* My old bank acct- $175.00

So far this is everything I have found, I feel like I am missing one, so I am still going through everything. If I do find anything else, I will update it. Thank you all again.

* Edit 3: I would like to add that over the summer we paid $135 a week, every week for our daughter to be in daycare. That really hurt us when it came to paying the bills. I just wanted to add that for a perspective since it is no longer in our monthly expenses.

* Edit 4: Added gas to my monthly expenses

* Edit 5: Added groceries

Edit 6: I am going to begin to add the interest percentages to our Credit Cards. I have to work at 5pm until 1am this morning. I will get as much updated as possible before then, and will continue when I am off work. Thanks again to everyone.

* Edit 7: I finally got an answer on the interest rate on the Wal-Mart card. When the program we are currently on ends (9% APR) it will shoot up to 27% interest which is insanely high.

* Edit 8: I made $111 in tips last night, and paid off the three smallest medical bills in her name, and paid our internet bill. I know it's insignificant, but I am stoked to make this lifestyle change. I also signed up for www.everydollar.com and www.undebt.it  . Both are pretty confusing, but I am trying my best to understand the websites and how they work. I am on the right path, and can't wait to come back to you guys with more good news in the near future!

* $10,000 check issued on an annual basis for first 5 years of employment (total: $50,000)
* A promissory note is signed annually prior to receiving the check that outlines the terms of the benefit
* An amortization schedule is provided with each $10,000 check, which carries an interest rate of 2.87% and a term of 5 years
* For every month I work for the company, a ""loan payment"" (according to the amortization schedule) is forgiven, with each $10,000 check being forgiven once I work 5 years past that check's issue date
* If I leave the company during the term of the loan(s), I must pay the company back the amount I have not been forgiven (across all loans) within 6 months

The company also offers a 401k with a 4% match, but I'm not eligible until next year.

During the loan term (5 years), I want the money to be invested in a place where it is accessible without penalty, but has the opportunity to grow conservatively.

Once the loan period is over, I would like to get more aggressive with it.

* Money Market
* CD
* 529 Plan

personalfinance,"85K student loan, I don't think my student loan servicer is applying loan payments as per the agreement","Hey guys, first time posting to this, but I read these threads often and have learned a lot.
I graduated college in 2014 with a hefty $85K student loan.  $15K is a student loan strictly in my name, comprised of 3 loans with different interest rates (pretty low because I am a recent grad).  The other $70K is in a parent plus loan on my behalf in my parents name.  My parents contribute to this when they can, but they are still helping my older brother pay down his student loans, and my younger brother just started his sophomore year of college (at a private school); so they're pretty buried and I end up making most of the payments, which is how I'd prefer it to be anyway.

I'm almost halfway down paying down my loans (!!) and have $40K left on the parent plus loan.  I make minimum payments on the student loan because the interest rates are half of what they are on the parent plus loan, so I make maximum possible monthly contributions to that.  Here is where it gets sticky... The parent plus loan is divided into 4 loans in different amounts; 3 of which have an annual interest rate of 7.9%, and one that has a 6.41% annual interest rate.  My (federal) student loan servicer clearly states on their website that any payments will be applied to accrued interest, then late fees, then the loan with the highest interest rate.  I even confirmed this with a representative on the phone when I began making payments a year ago.  But I just discovered this month that they are spreading out the rest of my payment (after paying accrued interest) across loans of both interest rates, and it's close to 20% of my overall payment being applied to the 6.41% loan.  I had a suspicion that they have been doing this all along, but I (stupidly) have never bothered to crunch the numbers until now.

They are definitely doing this with my student loan as well, and the rates on those loans are even more staggered; but because the overall loan is for much less, I assume the financial impact will be less.  Still, it's a huge loan and every dollar counts.  I am absolutely going to be giving them a call to straighten this out at lunch time, but before I do that I want to crunch some more numbers in Excel to see if I can come up with how much I'd owe right now had they been applying my loan payments like they said they would from the beginning.  Are they obligated in any way to repay that amount since they breached the loan agreement?  If so, what's my best course of action to ensure that they do?  My gut tells me it's probably not feasible to take legal action because it won't make financial sense, and I don't know shit about the legality of any of this.  Any advice you can provide would be much appreciate.",finance,1442494653
personalfinance,Better to save or pay off student loans?,"As the title suggests, is it better to quickly pay off student loans or to save more? My situation: I am just starting out in a professional job. Gross is 41k and I am paid monthly. Each paycheck (net) is about $2600. I put $300 in a 401k and put $300 in a savings account. I pay all of my other expenses (rent, utilities, cable/internet, phone, groceries, car insurance, etc). I own my car. The only debt I have is $12,660 in student loans. I pay the minimum payment each month of $150. So my question - should I take some (or all?) of the $300 I put in a savings account each month toward my student loan? The interest rate is on the loan is 6.8%, but I pretty much decimated my savings a few months ago (not the 401K but the other savings of $300/month) when I had to unexpectedly purchase a new-to-me car. I am wanting to purchase a home in the next few years because I could pay less on a mortgage payment than I am paying in rent. Unless I save I won't have much of a down payment. I do have 3k in an investment account that my dad set up for me, but outside of that and my 401k, I really have no savings. I know that you can purchase a home now with minimal-no down payment, but I would have to pay a mortgage insurance, correct? 
So the question - should I try to put $450 to my student loans every month or continue to only pay the minimum and save $300?

When I first joined, I was excited to see that I was in the ""Excellent"" range with a score of 791. A month later, it rose further to 796. Perfect!

But every month since, my score has been dropping for no apparent reason...789, 786, 783. LendingTree states that they use a ""VantageScore"" (Not FICO).

I'm now just 3 points away from dropping into a new range...My fiance and I are planning on purchasing our 1st home at the end of this year or early next, and we were hoping to get the best interest rate possible. With my credit score dropping at this quick rate, we'll get bumped down into a new range.

I requested my credit report and there was nothing alarming. Everything is paid on time, in full. I just have credit card bills/rent every month. No outstanding debt. My fiance has the same with the addition of a car payment (which will be paid in full next summer).

Some items to note:

* In the Spring, I had some fraudulent charges which were reported to collections...But I was able to verify they were fraud, and the delinquent payments from these fraudulent charges were removed. Once I knew it was in the clear, I requested my credit score, which was bumped up to 791. So it appeared that it was not affected.

* After seeing the 791 score, I attempted to increase it further by increasing my credit utilization rate. The higher credit limit was approved and my score just dropped a few points the next months. I figured it would have bumped up after that.... (My utilization is about 5%.)

* My fiance and I each have our own credit card as well as a joint credit card that is paid using a joint checking account (again, in full every month). - Credit card has a monthly limit of 10k and expenses are usually 1-2k a month.

TL-DR: My credit score is dropping every month, even though I'm paying all bills on time and don't have any alarming items on my credit report. Why, and how can I raise my score?",finance,1442497880

personalfinance,Question about Federal income tax on a lump payment from the US Government,"I realize this is a bit unusual but I have a tax question and I'm not sure where to go with it. 


My Dad is a US citizen (was born and brought up in Southern California). He joined the air force young, did 2 tours of Vietnam then was stationed in England where he met my Mum, got married, and left the force. He has lived in the UK only since the 70's. 


He was honorably discharged but in all this time has never received any money form the US Government for his service. 


I live in the US and when he visited us last year he contacted the VA because he needs surgery, to see if they would cover it. As part of their assessment process they run a check to see if he should be due any money from the government and decided he is not due anything. 


Then yesterday he got a call from the VA saying they had made a mistake, they thought he had been receiving monthly payments but when they looked again, they saw he hadn't, so the US government owes him money dating back to around 1973. It amounts to something like $800 adjusted for inflation plus interest on those back payments. All this means that he is due to receive a one time payment from the Government for all his back-pay for about $250,000!


This is wonderful news for a guy who volunteered for Vietnam twice, handled Agent Orange and has had breathing problems his whole life because of it. 


However, here is my concern. All these years he has lived in the UK. This means that if he had been receiving that $800 a month he should have received, he would have paid little or no income tax on it each year because that would have been his only US income.


I am worried that since they are going to give it to him in a lump sum they'll just tax it as income and he'll lose a chunk of it back to the Government (I am guessing 18-20% based on US tax brackets).


I would love any thoughts you have on whether they will tax him for this and if there's anyway to avoid it? 


Thanks again, I realize this is an unusual question, but any thoughts you guys have would be welcome.",finance,1442504221

personalfinance,Planning on refinancing private student loans with SoFi within the next few months. Looking for information and advice.,"I currently have 3 student loans through Wells Fargo with a 5.75%, 10.74%, and 11.95% interest rates.  Obviously, I want to get these numbers much lower and from what I've found, SoFi is the best option.  I'm planning on paying off all of my credit card debt before applying to ensure my credit score is as high as possible (last I checked my Fico is 752).  Also, I've been at my current job for about a year and a half.  My salary is about $50,000.  My only other expenses besides student loans are rent/utilities, car payment, car insurance, cell phone service, and internet service (I also have a Federal Loan which is bigger than my Wells Fargo loan, but the interest rate is lower, so I'm holding off on refinancing that for now).

Can anyone give me additional details regarding refinancing criteria with SoFi?  Has anyone refinanced with them that could give me an idea of my likelihood for being approved and the interest rates I can expect to be offered?  Any advice on improving my chances for approval and getting a better offer are also welcome.",finance,1442504379

personalfinance,What to do with Open Credit Cards,"Hi All,

About 2 months ago I completely paid off my credit card debt (~8.5k) and now I have 3 credit cards open.  I was thinking about closing them because I'd like to ultimately have one credit card, with a high limit as an emergency.  The problem is the biggest limit on one of the cards I have is 8k, but a 30% interest rate.  Explained more below:

* CC#1: 1FBUSA - PAID OFF - 8K Limit - 30% Rate
* CC#2: Chase Slate - PAID OFF - 1.2K Limit - 8.24% Rate
* CC#3: Capital One - PAID OFF - 1.75K Limit - 13.9% Rate
* FICO Credit Score: 826 (as of today)

So, you'll notice that whopping 30% on that one card.  This was one I used in college and it has a non-negotiable rate so I want to get rid of it.  However, it has the most money to fall back on in case of an emergency. I really want to cancel this card, but I'm afraid it'll hurt my score.  Ultimately, as I mentioned above, I want to have 1 card with at least 10K and good cash back bonuses, but first I don't know if I should close these or not, or just apply for a new one? The rates seems very high even for my secondary cards. 

TL;DR - I have 3 open cards (8.24%, 13.9%, 30% rate) paid off and want to eventually have one low rate card - what do I do?",finance,1442505260

My Father managed to sell a tough to sell apartment of ours in the US for two million dollars, but is now unsure as to what to do with it.

We had been in dire financial straits up to this, so it is a great relief. I am 19, and am about to leave for uni, but have a great relationship with my father and an excellent forum for financial information! (Guess who?)

I understand that this forum is usually for a different sort of information, but I need unbiased advice. We've asked the bank and financial advisors but of course I always want to try a neutral route.

My Father is in a debt of 800,000 euros (Spain), but at a manageable interest rate. 

Having a foot in the classical car and art industry, but we have been hearing rumours about a classical car bubble. As for investing in art, well, it's an extremely volatile market unless you want to dump in several million for a piece.

We could drop it in a fund in the US, but have been hearing lots of worrisome articles about a possible downturn in china leading to a stock market crash in the US. 

Spain, which would be logical seeing as we live here, would be good for investment due to our knowledge of the markets here. However, elections are due in a few months and a radical left wing party could win elections and send my father's company packing, leaving him jobless.

To anyone who has taken the time to read this, thank you! 

I am not too sure anyone could advise us on this here, but there must be a website or something for this piece of news. Sadly, we are both inversed in the spanish web, which has completely different forums, news etc. Seeing as our investment would have to be outside of Spain it complicates things.",finance,1442508329

personalfinance,My mother falsely claimed me as a dependent on her SNAP benefits ~3 years ago. I received an over payment bill for $~3600. What can I do?,"Hi,

Bit of a stupid situation from my less than intelligent mother. I have been living by myself since moving out in 2009 after graduating High school. I went to college and got a 6 month internship in the fall of 2012. Internship was paid and paid pretty well ($18/hr). Very recently I received a letter from the Oregon Department of Health Services saying there was an over payment of SNAP benefits to my family (Case name is listed as my Mom, but letter is addressed to me). This is because during the period I was working on my internship my mother still had me on her SNAP file.

It wasn't an honest mistake on her part, she fed me some lines about how she needed more money for the rest of my siblings (another who was 18, but not working at the time). Obviously the government was going to figure out about this considering all they had to do was correlate tax returns and other information.

The bill says I am liable for this $3600 as well as anyone else on the case (in this case its me, my mother, my step father and my younger brother). 

My mom can pay back the $3600 herself, she has agreed to do this. I am mostly concerned about side effects from this over payment action that might affect me (or my other family members) in the future. Will this hurt my credit? Will it show up on background checks and other things?

Was considering posting to /r/legaladvice, but my concerns are more financial than anything at the moment.

Any advice at all would be very appreciated.

EDIT: I contacted the DHS and let them know that I have not lived with mom during this period of time and have a hearing appointment in place.",finance,1442512198

personalfinance,[Planning] Need General Advice with Scholarship Money (24),"I'm going to be receiving a large scholarship this upcoming school year. I don't have any student loans because of the scholarships and grants I've received in the past years, and I've been living off that. I'll have about $30k and I have a general idea of what I want to do. (Note that I won't get all 30k at once. I'll receive roughly 10k every 3 months).

Some background. This scholarship requires me to work for the federal government after I graduate and prevents me from working part-time jobs while I'm in school. This means I won't have a steady income until I graduate in June. I can keep my student assistant job, but it doesn't pay that well. I don't believe I'll have a problem getting a government job as I have interned at NASA previously and a Government Contractor currently. (I'm a compsci major, if this provides more information).

My first purchase will probably be a car. My family isn't very well off and I have many younger siblings so my current car will be handed down because they are starting college. A lot of my money will be going to my family's bills as well because they struggle to pay them.

I've heard that credit unions typically give you a really good APR for loans, and I was thinking about financing my car through one. My family is also friends with a broker, so how would that work out? Would I tell the broker what I've been approved for so they can get a better deal from the dealer? I'm not too sure...

As for credit unions... I wanted to join the NavyFCU because the company I'm interning for is a DoD contractor. I'm not sure if they'll still consider me an employee because I'm an intern, however. I'll be calling today to find out.

I want to save the money/invest/etc, but the current situation my family is in kind of requires me to take action with the money to prevent things from getting worse. All of our credit is bad, as we've been evicted a number of times. We're doing fairly well now, but they don't have an emergency fund anymore because we've gone under so many times that any time they start working on one something bad happens.

In terms of my credit... I have a credit card and I've paid it off whenever I use it. However, I'm a co-signer of one of my older sibling's student loans from a private school... I know that co-signing is a bad idea and I was really hesitant to do it, but they wouldn't have been able to finish if I didn't. They fail to make the payments as they were not able to pass the nursing board exam yet so they aren't making enough money to pay off the loans. We're getting them deferred/forebeared as much as possible, but I'm not sure how long that will last. It's an ugly stain on my previously spotless credit report. This leads me to believe my credit is very bad.

Thank you all for any advice on what I should do at this point!",finance,1442516036

I work full time and my brother just recently got laid off so it has been really hard trying to support both of us. I don't have a car so I  rely heavily on public transportation or uber to get to work and back. I am really scared and need some advice right now, I was recently scammed on wallapop and now I have absolutely no money in my account anymore. What happened was the buyer of my TV sent me a check for 2,200 even though I was only selling it for 700, I was told to just deposit the full amount of 2,200 into my account and send him back the rest. Obviously this is sketchy as hell but the problem is I have been trying to sell my TV for a while because I was short a couple hundred on my rent this month. The day the buyer contacted me was the same day I received a 3 day notice to pay my rent or i would be charged $600 bucks in legal fees and me and my brother would be forced out. I was pretty much too excited to really look into it, I shouldn't have gone through with it. The weird part is the check I was sent was from a federal reserve bank, not a personal. I went into the bank to deposit it and to my surprise the funds were available the very next day. Me and my brother were excited because we now had the money to pay our rent. I had no idea that the check would bounce a couple days later but by then I had already withdrawn the 1,400 difference from my account  and sent it back to the buyer through money order. Now my account is negative 2,000 and I can't do anything. My job doesn't pay me again until the 25th, even then it won't be enough to get me back In the positive and still have enough for rent on the first. I called my police department and they said to go to ic3.gov and file a complaint there since it was an online only transaction, but I know i wont hear anything for a while.

I'd like to get your input on my situation, largely because I'm a complete idiot when it comes to this. Some stats:

- Loan was taken out in October, 2014 for a 60 month term.
- Loan is for a 2012 vehicle, current KBB trade-in value around $13k, private party ~$15k.
- Premium was $10,000, now $8,460.
- Interest rate is 4.29%
- Minimum monthly payment is ~$165, I typically pay ~$185. Of this, ~$155 gets put towards my premium, the rest toward interest.
- I have a credit score in the ~770 range.

**First question:** Should I refinance? Is it worth it? *Can* I refinance?
**Second question:** It seems like 16% of my monthly payment going towards interest seems high when the actual rate is 4.29%. What gives? Would it be better to pay more or just the minimum?
**Third question:** My goal is to have this paid off before the 60 month period. It's that long because that's what I could afford in terms of monthly payments at the time, but I've gotten a raise and would prefer to pay it down faster. What do?

Your wisdom is much appreciated. Obviously, I'm a total dunce when it comes to this stuff and I hate it. Any important information I neglected to include can be provided.

personalfinance,Please critique my budget!,"This is suuuper long, but I really wanted to give a breakdown of my budget and get some constructive criticism. Basically - what should I change to get the most bang for my bucks?

I use YNAB and have for the past year, but my husband and I only recently combined finances, so my historical data isn't 100% accurate to my situation. It has been an enormous help already in figuring out where to change the budget. We also use Mint for a basic overview to make sure we didn't miss much in YNAB.

My husband and I both have jobs in IT, and live and work in Detroit. Our combined pre-tax income is $118,000 per year, plus an annual bonus for me (the last few years it's been at least $5,000, but I do not count it in my budget, and when it happens then I put it in savings). Our take-home pay per month is currently around $5,900 a month (This will change in about 4 months, because his company makes him wait until the 6-month mark in order to contribute to his 401k). This also includes deductions for a ~10,000 401k loan that we used to secure the condo we bought. Some people may find this absurd, but it was worth locking it down, for us. In order to get an equivalently sized (1br/1ba) apartment in our area, it would be about $1,400, and moving farther away from work to lower rent would increase other expenses to the point that it would still be more, especially since we can now bike to work and are considering selling the car.

All of the expenses below, not counting the savings numbers set aside, give us a little over $1,600 a month to go towards savings or debt. In the past few months that amount went to savings (First for down payment/closing costs, then towards emergency funds), and now that the emergency funds have almost all been filled, any remainder is going directly to debts, specifically student loans.

I've added notes to many items below, but I'm sure I'll have missed some possible questions.

**Essentials**

| Budget Item            | Budgeted  | Last Month Total |
|------------------------|-----------|------------------|

| Groceries              | $230      | $234.47          |

1. HOA fees include building insurance, internet
2. Homeowner's insurance paid annually, I budget 1/12 per month
3. Utilities paid quarterly to condo association. I have not yet gotten my first bill, so the $130/mo is a complete estimate, hopefully overestimated.
4. Car insurance is PLPD/collision/comprehensive with a $250 deductible, for a 2010 Corolla. The high rate is because I live in Detroit, and cannot remove comprehensive until the car is paid off.

| Meetup Group Fees^2              | $29.98   |

1. Paid annually or semi-annually, budget spread out
2. I run two successful Meetup groups. For the most part, donations cover the monthly cost to run it, but otherwise I cover it.

**Debt**

| Debt                   | Payment | Balance | Interest Rate |
|------------------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Student Loans^1        | $474.57 | $45,630 | 3.15%-6.7%    |
| Car Loan^2             | $150    | $665    | 2.9%          |
| Entertainment Center^3 | $150    | $1,177  | 0%            |

1. All extra money over the next years will be towards eliminating this, starting with highest interest.
2. This is a 2010 Toyota Corolla, KBB value estimate around $7,800. The actual monthly payment is around $250, but I had paid a chunk up front and currently paying lower, without incurring penalties. I'm getting a small windfall this month and will use it to pay off the entire balance of $665 in order to free up that monthly payment to go towards student loans.
3. Perhaps a little overkill in price, but we really enjoy it, and are paying it off a little earlier than due for the 0% interest.

**Other Expenses**

| Budget Item        | Budgeted | Last Month |
|--------------------|----------|------------|
| Restaurants^1      | $300     | $234.47    |
| Cleaners^2         | $60      | $60        |

| Credit Card Fees^4 | $0       | $99        |
| Spending Money^5   | $1000    | $1053.31   |

1. Looking to cut down restaurant spending in the near future, succeeded a bit last month
2. Definitely not essential but gives peace of mind.
3. Miscellaneous small medical bills because we underestimated the need in our FSAs
4. Forgot to close a card beforehand, they wouldn't undo it, so I sucked it up and cancelled the card
5. I'll get into this later, I know it looks insane...

**Savings &amp; Goals**

| Savings                        | Monthly | Balance | Goal   |
|--------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|
| Emergency Fund^1               | ?       | $6,000  | $9,000 |
| Pet Care                       | ?       | $250    | $250   |
| Honeymoon^2                    | ?       | $3,560  | $3,560 |
| Car Repairs                    | $100    | $903.45 | $1,000 |
| Home Maintenance               | $100    | $0      | $2,000 |
| Retirement (Total in IRA/401k) | $200    | $45,000 | ?      |
| Aquarium Setup^3               | ?       | $0      | $500   |

1. The first goal is $6,000 and it will stay there until a dent is made in the student loans.
2. The Honeymoon fund has stayed in savings since we saved it up, the trip will be taken in March, somewhat frugally, with the goal of the remaining balance going into savings or towards debt.
3. Seems frivolous, but it's built-in to our condo. Will be paid for by freelance work on the side.

**About the spending money**

$1,000 definitely seems like a lot (and it is!) but the category includes both discretionary spending and discretionary savings for me and my husband separately. Whatever he spends or saves on, I have no say over, and vice versa. Spending includes clothing, work lunch, and miscellaneous personal purchases. Savings includes travel, gifts, and whatever new gadgets we want. In general, we can reduce costs of some categories and scale back on the spending money, but for the most part it's used responsibly, we love travel and technology, and often the budget is supplemented with freelance work on the side. In an emergency situation, this would be cut back on drastically.",finance,1442528743

personalfinance,"My wife's and my bills account for 83% of our total income, rather than the 50% recommendation I've seen elsewhere. What are some ways we can sort this problem out?","I work in IT, making $22/hr and getting a stable 40 hours a week. My wife works at Subway for $8.25/hr, and averages 30 hours per week. With this in mind, I calculate that our combined net monthly income is about $3,960 (Not 100% sure on my tax calculations, I just use a rough estimate of 19% for federal and state income taxes altogether).

Our current monthly expenses are:

* Rent, pet rent, water/sewer/gas, parking (all combined on one bill by the apartment complex): About $1050/mo, depending on utilities

* Electricity: Between $50-100/mo

* Food: About $700/mo (Feeding 3; My wife's brother is temporarily staying with us until he can get back on his feet)

* Medical insurance: $390/mo (covering both of us, through my employer)

* Car payments: $526.02/mo (2 vehicles)

* Car insurance: About $255/mo

* Cell service: $90/mo (Cricket Wireless, 2 smart phones with 5 GB/mo each)

* Internet access: About $90/mo (Centurylink)

* Credit card payments: Minimum payment of about $57/mo, although we pay a lot more than this every month.

* Netflix: $9 (I know this should technically go under the entertainment category and not under bills, but since it's a very small amount and we use Netflix heavily during our down time I left it under bills for the sake of simplicity)

Caveats and my own thoughts on these are, by expense:

* Rent, etc: Unfortunately moving is not an option until our lease expires next Spring. Even then, we would have to move quite a distance from here to get a better deal which would drag out both our commutes and make getting rid of one or both cars less of an option. I suggested giving up our two cats ($70/mo pet rent) but my wife is adamantly against that. Roommates may be an option, but we don't know anyone trustworthy that we could rely on to pay their bills on time who isn't allergic to cats.

* Electricity: We're working on building good habits like shutting down things when not in use, reducing use of the A/C (which is difficult because our apartment is very hot, even at night. The winter should help some on that front).

* Food: Once the brother has gotten work and gets his own place (or starts contributing to the household, either way) this should improve. We also have a bad habit of getting sidetracked and forgetting to shop for groceries or eat for long stretches of time, resulting in fast food filling the gap and driving up costs, so we need to get a better handle on that.

* Medical insurance: Not much I can do with this one that I know of. All I can do when I look at my pay is weep and tell myself that at least we won't get nailed as hard on taxes come next Spring.

* Car payments: We originally got the second car because our schedules differed too dramatically to work with just one, and neither of us were willing to deal with the clusterfuck that is Denver's public transportation. As it stands now neither vehicle is worth what we owe on it, so we'd have to pay extra to be rid of them. The soonest we could sell one without it being at a loss (assuming it holds its value) would be May or June next year. Once one of the cars is gone if I were to rely on public transit I could get a monthly pass for $80 for our local fare zone. Alternatively I could just walk to work, but that wouldn't leave much free time. Another option would be a motorcycle since I could pick up a relatively cheap one on Craigslist and am already qualified to ride, but I'd be S.O.L. during the winter.

* Car insurance: See Car Payments. Beyond that, we're currently with State Farm. I'm open to changing providers, but don't know where to start on that.

* Cell service: My wife and I are both internet junkies so we make heavy use of our phones. If we downgraded to a basic plan and got flip phones, it would be $45/mo. I've thought about getting a landline, but neither of us want to lose our phone numbers if we can avoid it.

* Internet access: Currently we're paying for 40 Mb/s, with no add-ons. We're both gamers so if we can avoid losing bandwidth that would be great.

* Credit card payments: The current amount owed is $2,302.25 (My car had some expensive repairs needed to the engine, then a couple months later had 2 tires slashed. This is following a period of some frankly embarrassingly bad spending choices). Right now my strategy is to immediately divert my whole paycheck into the credit card, then pay the other bills from it. It's working well so far, and as an added bonus the threat of the interest rate helps me keep better control over my spending. The cash rewards also can help chip away at the remaining debt a little.

* Netflix: This is an unnecessary luxury, I realize, but considering how nice it is to be able to dig up new movies and TV shows to watch without illegally downloading them and how little it costs, I don't foresee getting rid of it.

What do you think, are there any options I missed here? How can we improve? 

Apologies if this is not the right place to come with this.

personalfinance,Buying a car with 0% APR credit cards.,"Hello personalfinance,

I'm currently looking to buy a car and I'm trying to figure out the method of doing this. I currently have about 1000 saved that will go directly towards any purchase I make. I have located a solid vehicle (2005 Honda Accord hybrid with 130000 miles and a new hybrid battery for $5500. My mechanic has inspected me and approves of the purchase at that price) Here is my thinking:

I could take the standard route of taking out a loan from a credit union. I have not yet gotten a quote on what my interest rate would be.

Alternatively, I currently have a discover card with 0% interest for the next 9 months.  I have been contemplating making my payment with this card and then transfer ing the balance to a 0 transfer fee/0% APR card, such as the chase slate card. This would give me another 15 months, totaling at 24 months of 0 interest rate. I am just wondering how this will impact my credit score (currently 666 due to late payments on a student loan from 3 years ago).

I make approx. $33,000 in salary and it should be no problem to pay my balance off in full in 24 months. I would just like to run this by this sub as I often see very solid advice given here.

personalfinance,IRS Levy (garnishment) of SSD income verses a payment plan,"I am a representative payee for a friend of mine who is on Social Security disability. This past month, there was a garnishment from the IRS taken from her benefits as per the bank statement. We (neither she nor I) never received any notification of this. I contacted SS and they said it was from the IRS for $185 a month but that was all they knew. We contacted the IRS and it's around $1k total owed to which they are garnishing in a Federal Payment Levy Program (so about 6-7 months of payments). The IRS is saying they don't send any paperwork out after the initial notice which we did not receive (it was sent to her prior address from 2012). Is there any benefit of setting up a repayment plan vs just letting them garnish the benefits. It's not causing a hardship. The IRS representative was not helpful and said there were fees associated with it and then a paper check would have to be mailed so it kind of seems like it would be a pain, they also wanted to lower the payment to $25 a month, I'm assuming there would then be more interest and penalties to be paid if the payment was lowered and therefore lengthened. They also said she would not get any paperwork when it was paid off and that the only way to get any paperwork was to make a payment agreement.

TLDR- is making a payment plan with the IRS better than letting them continue to garnish SSD income? And how can we obtain paperwork of the garnishment?",finance,1442531807

They say turbo tax makes filing pretty idiot proof but I feel that my return was rather low being a first time homebuyer.  I know it will be hard to say one way or the other being there are so many variables, but I thought Id try and ask anyway and see if I should maybe have my 2014 income taxes reviewed next year. Anyway, in 2014 I purchased my first home and made about 48,7XX in gross income putting me in the 25% bracket.  I filed single 0.  I claimed about 2400 in mortgage interest and roughly 2200$ in property taxes, 500$ in donations, and I did not have many additional write offs.  Im not sure how much I paid into state taxes or soc. security which makes getting a straight answer that much more difficult.

I am thinking of throwing $2000 on it right away but where do I go from that? Monthly payments? How do I know what a good amount for a payment is? I want this to disappear as fast as possible so I can begin saving again but I just don't know how to go about it.

personalfinance,"No Future Now! Financial Aid, Insufficient Funds, and No Parents to be Seen.","Today, I have just been informed that I will not be getting financial aid from my university. Well, that is not entirely true: I cannot get aid because my FAFSA is incomplete. Why? Missing parent information. ""Well, dumb ass, give them the needed info and move on!"" Funny. Yeah... not gonna happen. Let me explain.

February of 2013, I had struggled in my CC classes and decided to drop out and work full time. My mother did not like this idea what so ever. I was kicked out of my home and was homeless for a couple of days. I eventually rented a space from a co-worker for a few months. My grandfather later invited me into his place to stay while I got back on my feet. That fall I returned and started/completed my calculus course completing with a B average overall. I then signed up for my later classes the next fall. Bear in mind here I have not had contact from my mother nor my father over this time. During this time, they had moved somewhere to the Mid West, South Dakota if I believe. That is all I know of their whereabouts. Anyway, I go through my last year at CC and got accepted into the state flagship school. I filed my FAFSA, set up my class schedule, file for dependency waiver, and waited to move.

Finally, I arrive to the University to begin my studies. No bumps have occurred. All of a sudden: Three weeks after school starts, I get a letter from finances that I am delinquent on payments to the school, (or at least a payment from one of their departments.) I find this weird in two ways: 1.) No financial aid package has arrived, 2.) why am I delinquent when they could just put a hold on my account?

Anyway, long story short, they denied my waiver and told me that I need my parents private info or the Fed cannot award me aid. They guided me towards private options, but they require a cosigner. No one that I know has any credit...or good credit for that fact.

I really do not want to drop out AGAIN! It already looks bad on my current record and a second drop would decrease my chances of getting back in. Not to mention any chances for Grad school! I cannot get a full-time job. There are only part-time. The minimum wage does not cover all my needed payments. Multiple jobs conflict with my schedule and with each other. I never considered the military. Don't think they will accept me. I also don't want to be cannon fodder.

Really, here is where I am. I have no cash to give these guys, I have not been in contact with my parents for over 2 years now. The school thinks my parents are 'refusing to help' me. My grandfather can't do anything. He is in no way my guardian. He is in financial trouble as well. Running a farm is not cheap! Why can't a 21 year old just get some aid? Why is it mommy and daddy need to help me when at 18 I have the privilege to do many things: smoke, gamble, vote, shoot a gun, join the forces. Yet, I can't get aid to pay for school? College? The one thing that has allows me to obtain a statistical chance that I will be in some form of employment that enables me to pay them back? Or how about the fact that any help I get concerning loans are not dis-chargeable in bankruptcy court?

investing,Soon to be graduate with a desire to invest.,"Hey guys, new to investing. I've always been interested in getting more from my cash, but am not that informed about it. I only took a 2nd year course in financial mathematics, which isn't anything to show other then I'm not completely clueless.

I'm a Math and CS dbl major, and I'm a software developer currently on an internship making pretty good cash. It occurred to me that because I'm pretty informed in the tech space, that I could potentially leverage my knowledge to help make wise investments.

I have an outstanding debt &gt; $25,000. (I don't need to make payments for 6 months after graduation). 
I got into a few discussions with people about whether paying debt off first is the wise option or if investing my money now is if returns &gt; debt interest rate.

After some online research, it seems that I could definitely spread the debt out. I do not see myself making some sort of house down payment until 30. 

So after giving you some background, I would like some help with the following:

1. How can I get into investing? I want to make large returns, and have heard index funding can give you 10%+ returns.
2. Does my tech knowledge help me in the slightest? 
3. I have a little over 10,000 saved just chilling in a student account.  This money makes me feel safe, but I could definitely invest half of it if needed.
4. Am I being a bit delusional with expected returns? I want to make safe investments, but at the same time am not educated in this field. Would it be better to let someone handle my money for a fee?",finance,1442548583

personalfinance,"I am in need of some serious financial guidance, I done goofed!","Hey reddit,

&amp;nbsp;

**Intro:** Been really debating whether or not to write this post since I have been following /r/StudentLoans and /r/personalfinance for the past few years and I know how you guys can be. **^EDITED ^FOR ^PF ^SLIGHTLY ^STRICTER ^RULES** Today though I am ready for your beating, maybe something good might come from it.

**FOR PF:** I am also posting this here in hopes to get idea's for whats outside of just focusing on the loans. My parents might be willing to help if there is a good suggestion. Someone I talked to mentioned home equity or something like that. I have no clue which is why I am turning to all of you.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background Info:** I'm 22 and graduated with a Bachelors in Science last month (08/2015) from a well respected private college from a program that is well known in its field of work across the country. The one tiny ray of light in this whole story is that I managed to have a job offer signed before I was even half way through my senior year. It pays pretty good for starting position, its about standard for my field of work. Downside to my field of work is it pretty much caps out at a senior position with 8-10 years of work at $85k-$100k. And unlike most people with the amount of loans I have, I am not going to be a doctor/lawyer who will have the salary to comfortably pay for this.

All of my student loans are currently in their grace period until 02/16. Also currently my credit score is 740, I made sure to focus on that well I was in school hoping it would help.

&amp;nbsp;

**Financial Info:** Here's where the story gets fun. Let me lay all the numbers on you real quick and no, that wasn't a typo, I didn't accidentally hit an extra digit.

&amp;nbsp;

**Income/Current Money-** Salaried at $45,000/yr or 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;$2,745.70 a month after taxes and stuff.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;$3,000 in my savings account. Currently saving about $1000 a month until my grace period is over.

**Expenses-** Rent is $400/month (living at home)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Car Insurance is $80 a month

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Other random things like prescription and gym is about $50 a month

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Two credit cards I used for building credit/living expenses in school currently $900 total but will be paid off before my grace period is over.

&amp;nbsp;

**Student Loans:** Now no one go dying on me well reading this gargantuan screw up I started digging myself into before I knew better.

Tuition at my school was between $42k and 46k by the time I graduated. I received around $2,000 in money from the school, grants, etc. I had no money saved up, I had no college fund, no rich great aunts, no suit case of unmarked bills under my bed. But for real, I have no idea how some of my classmates chalked up the money for this school. The second highest person I could find at my school said they had $45k in loans and my school claims the average grad has around $20k. Where they hell do all these people get $110k and how did I miss that presentation.

Unfortunately my co-signers would all get hit with the bill again so I'd prefer to take option 1 if I were to go this route.

3. Rate Reduction Plan- Came across people talking about this on Reddit. Tried calling Navient about it and the woman got all pissy with me that I even tried to discuss my loans with them well they are in grace period and there is nothing they could do until February. But for real, she actually started having an attitude with me just for asking, if I didn't get so pissed off at her for that I would have stayed on the line till I was chatting with the CEO and she was packing a box. Probably should call back soon and see if someone else will be a little more friendly.

4. Refinancing- Tried every online application I could find. Citizens only allows $90k for bachelors. Earnest said good luck, Lendkey denied me in about 10 seconds, DRB after winning the award for the worlds oldest website and longest form to fill out I got tired of doing stuff for them and havent uploaded documents yet. Going to stop by a few banks this weekend to see if any of them have any ideas.

Sofi is the only one who has even come close to accepting me. Main issue is that they are requiring a co-signer for the loan. As of right now I am having some issues with that but its been my main focus for a few days now. With Sofi my monthly payment would be $960~. That I could kind of actually afford.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion:** Well you are still here so I thank you for taking the time to read this. If I seemed to be a little rude/teasing any of you/this sub-reddit know its only out of jealousy that probably all of you are financially smarter than I am and actually have financial freedom.

The main frustration for me at this point is realizing that I should not have gone to this college. It was way above what I or my family could afford. Unfortunately back in high school, when everyone was telling me to go to college I wasn't informed enough to have any idea what I was doing. They just kept writing me tuition checks and said have fun. I completely blame myself for just not having a clue. They all told me I could do what I wanted once I finished school. What a joke that is I just get to live in my moms basement and be broke.

And also I fully intend to pay for every penny that I said I would. I am not looking for some backdoor solution to weasel my way out of my obligation. That's not who I am. I simply want to be able to afford to live even if that means me paying $300,000 over the course of 40 years.

&amp;nbsp;

I also want to add that whats really put me down with this whole situation is I had two goals for after college. 
1. Start my own company in my field of work. Luckily for me it can start small and fairly cheap, just online based with a few thousand to get started. My issue would be trying to survive off the income well dealing with a giant never ending bill. Even if I became homeless and ate ramen 3 times a day I would still need almost $1,000 a month (if I can refinance). I've already kind of started working on this goal with a classmate I graduated with, unfortunately I cant really contribute to helping start it when I have $30 left over a month.

2. Or move to Europe within 3 years. Either Netherlands or France. My degree has a lot of opportunities over the pond and I spent a semester traveling and living in Germany and I can honestly say I cannot stand living in the states since I've been back. Issue with this is with exchange rates and cost of living I don't see it being possible. Plus just needed to save money to cover moving there is going to be hard.

&amp;nbsp;

**So Reddit, be brutishly honest with me, how screwed am I? Got any idea's? Any ways of lowering payments outside of refinancing? Anyone want to co-sign for a hard working, motivated individual?** ^Haha, ^I've ^seen ^how ^you ^guys/gals ^talk ^about ^co-signers ^and ^thank ^god ^your ^not ^my ^family. ^Or ^maybe ^you ^should ^have ^been ^so ^I ^wouldn't ^be ^in ^this ^mess. Any recommendation's for maybe even planning for my two goals?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading,
Josh

P.S. This ""grace period"" is the most annoying thing on earth. Navient/Sallie Mae will not even talk with me once they see my account is still in grace. They wont even let me opt out of it so I can start working with them on trying to fix my loan's. So now I am stuck here for 6 months with no idea what my payments will actually be and no way of trying to work with Navient to try and fix it. LIKE WTF! Don't you want my money! I want to start paying you sooner! I thought that's all you cared about, money!

worldpolitics,"Federal Reserve Bank, Citing Global Economy, Keeps Rates Near Zero Percent","The US Federal Reserve on Thursday again delayed its promised increase in the benchmark federal funds interest rate, which has remained at zero-to-0.25 percent since the height of the financial crisis in December of 2008. The US central bank has for months been signaling its intention to begin raising rates this year, but has repeatedly put off such action under intense pressure from Wall Street and global financial institutions.

Thursday’s meeting of the Fed’s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was the object of intense and nervous concern internationally, coming in the midst of a marked slowdown in global growth and extreme volatility on financial markets. The focus of international attention on the Fed meeting reflects the degree to which the entire world economy has become dependent on infusions of cash from the major central banks into the financial markets.

Trillions of dollars have been funneled to the banks and finance houses that dominate the markets—some $4 trillion from the Fed alone—to pay off the bad debts of the financial elite and facilitate its further enrichment on the basis of speculative and parasitic activities. These massive subsidies for the super-rich have done little to revive the real economy, which has never truly recovered from the September 2008 Wall Street crash. Instead, they have underwritten a nearly three-fold rise in stock prices and a further growth of financial activities such as mergers and acquisitions, stock buybacks and stock dividend increases that divert resources from productive investment. Investment levels in the major capitalist countries are at least 25 percent below pre-crisis levels.

Record-low interest rates and so-called “quantitative easing” programs (central bank bond purchases) have overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest social layers, fueling a further growth of social inequality on a world scale.

The FOMC statement initially sparked near-euphoria in the markets, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by more than 100 points in the first hour after the release of the statement. When the US cable channel CNBC announced the decision at 2 p.m., there was an audible roar from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

However, the rally faded and US stocks ended the day with mixed results. The Dow closed down 65 points and the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index fell 5 points, while the Nasdaq ended with a slight rise of nearly 5 points.

It would appear that the initial exuberance over the decision to delay a rate hike was tempered by concerns over the state of the global economy and world financial system as reflected in the FOMC statement. In a marked departure from previous Fed statements, which have rarely referred to international conditions, Thursday’s release, after noting that exports have been “soft” and inflation has run well below the Fed’s target of 2 percent, stated: “Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.”

This was a reference to data showing a marked slowdown in industrial activity, exports and inflation in China, which has accounted for half of global growth since the 2008 crash, along with huge losses on Chinese stock markets and last month’s surprise devaluation of the yuan.

The China slump has exacerbated economic and financial problems in other so-called “emerging market economies” that are heavily dependent on commodity exports, including Brazil, Russia, Turkey, South Africa and a number of Asian economies. These countries have experienced a sharp fall in growth, exports and currency values, while their debt loads have become increasingly unsustainable due to the increasing strength of the US dollar.

At the same time, Europe is barely growing and Japan’s economy contracted in the second quarter.

The signs of deepening recession abound. Data released last month showed world trade contracting in the first half of 2015 more sharply than at any time since the height of the crisis in early 2009. Commodity prices continue to plummet, reflecting a decline in industrial activity and demand.

On Wednesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) issued its Interim Economic Outlook, lowering its projections for global growth from three months ago. It cut its 2015 forecast from 3.1 percent to 3.0 percent and its 2016 projection from 3.8 percent top 3.6 percent.

While US growth rates are better than those in Europe and Japan, although far lower than in previous periods of ostensible recovery, manufacturing continues to contract and prices are barely rising, according to government reports, reflecting deflationary pressures in the world economy.

The US Labor Department reported Wednesday that its Consumer Price Index fell 0.1 percent in August, the first decline since January. In the 12 months through August, the index rose a mere 0.2 percent.

The convergence of these developments sparked wild swings on US and global stock markets last month. At one point, after the Dow had fallen nearly 1,000 points within minutes of the start of trading, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told reporters that international developments had made the case for a Fed rate increase in September “less compelling.”

This intervention, by reassuring the financial aristocracy that the Fed would continue to underwrite its fortunes and likely put off a rate increase, had the intended effect of preventing a full-scale collapse of the market.

Among those organizations and individuals who had called on the Fed to refrain from raising rates at its Thursday meeting were the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Last week, the chief economist of the World Bank told the Financial Times that the Fed risked setting off “panic and turmoil” if it decided to lift rates.

While sentiment for delaying raising rates as long as possible predominates in financial circles, there are opposing forces who argue that the longer the Fed waits before beginning to increase rates, the greater the uncertainty and the worse the economic and financial fallout. Last week, the chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase urged the Fed to begin lifting rates at its Thursday meeting.

One FOMC member, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond, Virginia Fed, voted against the decision to keep rates at near-zero, saying he favored an immediate 0.25 percent increase. His vote was the first dissent on the FOMC this year.

In its statement, the FOMC sought to reassure the markets that even if it began to raise rates as early as this October or December, the increases would be small and gradual. The statement declared: “The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”

In a press conference following the release of the statement, Fed Chair Janet Yellen reiterated the central bank’s concern over global developments. “In light of the heightened uncertainty abroad,” she said, “the committee judged it appropriate to wait,” adding, “Given the significant economic and financial interconnections between the US and the rest of the world, the situation abroad bears close watching.”

Yellen singled out China and the emerging market economies, citing capital outflows and pressure on exchange rates. At the same time, she issued assurances that the Fed would continue to maintain a “highly accommodative” monetary policy.

This was reflected in projections released by the Fed on US growth, inflation and the federal funds interest rate. The central bank revised downward its projection for growth in 2016 and 2017, scaled back its projection for inflation, and predicted that the federal funds rate would increase more slowly than previously forecast.

While the number of FOMC members predicting no rate increase until 2016 at the earliest rose from two to four, Yellen stressed that a large majority of the committee continued to forecast an initial rate hike later this year.",finance,1442573542

Bitcoin,We have at least several more years of regulatory hell ahead of us,"Fincen says it's a currency. So we have to register as a money services business and do KYC/AML whenever we exchange it. Oh, and two people in a room exchanging one digital currency for another digital currency is ""money transmission"" so you need 40+ money transmitter licenses for that. Oh, and the CFTC says it's a commodity so they can make you get a commodities trading license. The IRS says it's a commodity for tax purposes because, of course, if it were a currency, you'd pay less in taxes. Oh, you thought bitcoin-denominated shares and colored coins were revolutionary? Wait until you hear what the SEC thinks. Ask Voorhees. And now we have the pleasure of waiting for 40+ more states to pass their own bitcoin licenses. 

I wish we had a smart federal judge who could interpret these laws and tell the federal government what bitcoin actually is and what laws apply to it. Several cases have come to light which would have given a judge an opportunity to do so. But because the defendants were facing such heavy fines and jailtime, they all agreed to plea guilty for deals instead of going to trial. Can't blame them.

 Another option is for the federal government to pass a federal framework (trumping state laws) that say how bitcoin must be treated. Fat chance of that happening any time soon. It would take years.

Another option might be for one of these bitcoin businesses to try to get a declaratory judgment from the American courts. They would essentially say that they are experiencing a harm in the form of  regulatory interference with their businesses because the CFTC, Fincen, Etc. are all defining bitcoin as different things and the exchange wants the courts to say exactly what it is and what regulations apply to it.  That would probably take at least a year or two. 

Conclusion: There's at minimum a 2 year window of time ahead of us where various government agencies and jurisdictions (like Lawsky's NYDFS) are going to have free reign to basically pile on and suck the blood from bitcoin. This will make running any bitcoin business or using bitcoin in any way a semi-legal affair.

The South American country's economy entered a recession after reporting two consecutive quarters of decline in growth.The recent announcement is a technicality: Brazil's economy has been suffering for some time now.

The country was part of the BRIC – Brazil, Russia, India and China – grouping, which was supposed to usher in a new world economic order through prolific growth rates in the coming years. For some time at the turn of this decade, that seemed to be true in Brazil's case. The country racked up impressive growth rates on the back of a boom in commodities and energy exports. Even in the face of conservative analyst predictions, the Brazilian government maintained that it would achieve average growth rates of 4.5% in the coming years.

But, Brazil's economy has unraveled since 2013. A complex cocktail of rising inflation, droughts and corruption scandals has engulfed the country, and it has become the worst performer among BRIC markets. (See also: Understanding The Risk In The BRICS.)

Initially, I tried to pay off my cards (higher interest rate), but I've also been running them up again afterwards (I am just entering the ""roses"" phase of ""bread and roses""), so have been wondering whether I should just leave the cards alone for now and pay down my SL since I know those numbers won't be going back up once I eliminate the loan. Is there an optimal way for me to allocate this $800/monthly to my 3 debts? Thanks for any help in advance. This sub has been so great for me. :)",finance,1442586895

personalfinance,"$86,000 owed in student loans, can not get a job with my Masters degree and have a child due in May...HELP","Hi fellow Redditors, to start I will extrapolate a little on my student loans. 
I currently have seven notes that are all handled by Navient (Federal Student Loans). ~$11,500(4 notes) have  interest rates ranging from 3.4-4.5% and are deferred until January 2016 . I have three graduate loans: $37,292 at 7.21%, $21,665.87 at 6.21%, and a third $17,000 at 6.21%. My masters will be done this December and is from The University of Tennessee in Lab Management.  As of now, I have not had any job prospects (applied 7 places) but will continue to search and apply. 

As far as any assets, my spouse and I have a very very small savings(~$2000) and I have $13,000 in mutual funds. My spouse is currently making about $3000/month and I hope to find a job that can pay about the same or a little more. Bills range anywhere from $1200/month-$1400/month and we currently have about $16,000 left in payments on my spouse's car.

My dilemma is this: We are expecting our first child in May, my current car just had the transmission go out last night (2005 Malibu with 160,000miles), and I can not find a job( I know this is sounding like a bad country song).
Basically, I am trying to figure out what is the best approach to managing my money and assets wisely as to not cause more harm than good to my overall financial well being. Thoughts that have gone through my head range from quitting my masters program and getting a refund($17000) so that I can purchase a new car and not go further into debt, fix the car ($3500) and stay in the program, or get a new car and stay in the program.

My question is if I quit the masters program, I may potentially rule out a higher paying job but on the same token is it worth continuing and spending the money on this last semester which could go toward a car? Further, should I touch the money in my mutual funds to help offset the costs of some of my debt or leave it in and let it continue to grow?  I really am confused and would appreciate any advice on my situation. Thank you",finance,1442588295

I sent a letter to the CEO of my mortgage company explaining the accidentally missed 2nd mortgage payment in July.  I requested that they please review my account, and noted that while it was facutal, it was not a reflection of my actual credit worthiness. 

They called me on Wednesday, and said they were reviewing my request.  Well, this morning I got an email from my credit monitoring service, and it looks like they have removed it!  My ""calculated"" credit score went from 624 to 654 on Transunion.

In addition, the fed didn't change the rate this week, so I am a pretty dang happy guy.  I can now refinance, and get over this very difficult financial hump.

personalfinance,Question Regarding Student Loans and Current Finances?,"I'm nearing the end of my four-year degree. I unfortunately waited until I was in my later 20's to go back, but hey.. better late than never. I went to a University for part of earning my associates degree, then on to the Bachelor's. My student loan debts will total about 50K when done. I am curious how I should handle this. I currently own my home and it is paid for. I am wanting to sell and move somewhere closer to work.

My payments for student loans would be roughly $550 a month, I imagine, to pay it off in 10 years. The interest rate is what kills most people. I am curious if I should just take the money from my home and pay off the student loans right away so that I don't get nailed by interest, or if I should just hold onto the money for my home and put towards another home and pay off the student loans (My place should get me about 110K, maybe a bit less).

I am only making about 43K a year right now, and anticipate I will stay in this job for a while.

I could either make a 100k down payment and get a 100k mortgage or  I could make a 50k downpayment, get a 150k mortgage and then pay off 50k the first day.

My thought is that for a loan like a mortgage where you pay more interest up front and more principal at the end, by taking the second option you are probably saving a ton of money by short circuiting the part of the loan where you are paying the highest interest rate (the first 1/3rd of your payments).

I would imagine the same would apply for a car loan or anything else.

So I'm in negotiations about my job and my salary, and I'm to a point where it's become clear that the company can't or won't come close to industry averages.

I am a senior system administrator, plus I manage 4 remote employees, and I'm making $40k/yr. After a favorable review, which could be summed up as ""You are in a shitty situation, lots on your plate, but things will be looking up soon, yay!"" I asked for a raise. They were apparently unprepared for the question, and after a couple of days delay for them to discuss, they came back. Now the conversation has turned to ""You are bad at your job and you should feel bad, if you make these positive changes over the next 3 months, we can offer a $5k raise"".

Annoyed at the change in tone, and the lack of any consideration of an immediate raise, I said that if I made those changes, i'd expect something more along the lines of $10-15.

they'll get back to me on that, they say. Next meeting is this afternoon, and they say they have several options for me to consider.

Long story short, I really don't think they can afford to pay a competitive wage, and I haven't seen effort toward real internal change to make the job *quality* begin to make up for the low pay.

**END OF SAD STORY**

I need a new job, or I need ""fuck you"" money. If I had about $1300, then I'd be ok for 2 weeks. I'm married, wife makes $50k, and we are essentially month-to-month with our bills because we have some credit card debt that we're successfully paying down. CC debt is 0% for another 6mo, but we've already surfed it once, I want it gone.

Options include:

* Asking my parents about the $25k life insurance policy they started when I was a kid that I don't have control of. I'm 28 now. Specifically to use the cash value to get by for a few weeks.
* Just plain asking them for cash, which I don't want to do, because my brother is in *much* worse financial shape, and I think in the next year he might be in desperate need of parental assistance.
* Lowering bills - not sure what else we can drop, nothing that gets us to the amount we need. We've dropped our retirement savings as much as we can to finance our new furnace.

personalfinance,Looking for Refinancing On Student Loans,"I hope the following information comes out clearly.

I graduated college last year (August 2014) and went to a major University. Due to both mine and my parents financial situation, I had to take out private loans in order for me to pay for school (my father cosigned). My jobs that I worked generally covered rent, food and books while the loans paid for school.

I've entered repayment as of November 2014 and have been paying on the loans since. I've had two late payments due to me being an idiot and not regularly double checking what's been paid on my list of bills, however my total is going down. I owe three different sources money.

    Government -          30,971.25    ~ 4.5-6% Fixed
    Discover -            10,994.79    ~ 8%     Fixed
    Sallie Mae/Navient -  4702.94      = 9.25%  Variable
                          2793.27      = 7.88%  Variable
                          7,192.68     = 12%    Fixed
                          3,623.61     = 8%     Variable
                          5,326.23     = 9.62%  Variable
                          5,840.02     = 9.62%  Variable
    Total =               71444.79
    Private Total =       40473.54 

Given the interest rates that I'm paying, on both the Discover and Navient, I'm getting shafted. 

My Credit Score is 719, so if I understand them correctly this is decent. 

Overall, I've been making the minimum payment as between these three lenders I pay anywhere between 900 to 1000 per month. I've checked on the Navient loans and roughly half of what I'm paying per month is currently going towards interest.

I wanted advice on potentially refinancing and deciding between financing the entirety of my student loans or just the private ones, upsides and downsides or other things to note, companies that do refinancing and anyone's personal experience with refinancing. 

My personal thought is that I should refinance the private loans so I can get a lower fixed interest rate, but am slightly unsure whether to refinance Government loans as well. 


Additional Information:
I work for a larger company and make just above 60K per year, plus a potential bonus around February/March. I pay $600 per month renting a house with my roommate and roughly $300 in utilities plus personal phone bill, contribute 8% to a  401K (Company matches at 4% and gives a base of 4%). I stick about 10% of my paycheck into savings as I'm attempting to build up a safety net fund, contribute $50 per paycheck towards an HSA for medical costs.
I was in a car accident just over a month ago and had to purchase another car to get to and from work. I took out a loan for 15,100 at 3.5% fixed rate and new car plus insurance is $450 per month

wife has 2 student loans left at ~5k total, 5.6% and 6.8% interest.

I had taken out a loan against my 401k while we were buying a house to make sure we had a very nice cushion in case anything went wrong. We used only a little of the money, but put the rest back and paid it off already.


So my question... Is it a bad idea to take out another loan against my 401k to pay off the 5k that way the interest I would be paying would go back to my 401k instead of the lender? The interest rate would ~4.2%, but again if it's going back to me I don't really care too much about it. 

I'm not super concerned with another ding of my credit being ran and my 401k balance is presumably healthy for my age (55k, 26 yo). I'd ideally like to not pay the full balance out of pocket as we're still focusing on putting money away for the mortgage emergency fund.

Unfortunately, that has not been the case. I am currently a nursing student with two years left of schooling and a part-time worker.

I am conflicted because I am already a low mileage driver so a used car doesn't seem quite as risky, but because I would be paying $200~ a month for a decent used car I am strongly considering the leasing option. I only have a small amount of automotive knowledge and I've never owned a car with over 150k miles so I am really unsure what to expect with a used vehicle.

personalfinance,Newly self employed ... help!,"Hello PF! I'm hoping someone here can help me out ... this week, I was approached with a long-term, stable, full time contract - and offered a choice:

1. Become a W2 employee through an existing vendor that would subcontract me to the project; or
2. Act as an independent entity on a 1099 basis

In either scenario, I am not receiving benefits from the company. I am an independent contractor, on an hourly, at will contract. The 1099 vs W2 choice is only intended to effect the channel through which they funnel my payments.

As a W2 employee of the intermediary, they will withhold state, federal, and FICA taxes and provide me a paycheck. While at first, this sounded good - I have several concerns over going this route, and was hoping you all could sanity check my logic:

1. I will be paying health care out of pocket AFTER TAX
2. I will be making retirement contributions AFTER TAX
3. I will be incurring non-reimbursed business related travel expenses

I estimate my gross income will be $80,000 more than my Adjusted Gross Income. Since, as a W2 employee, they will be withholding against my gross, and all deductible expenses will be paid out of pocket after tax, I estimate they'll withhold $24,000 over my actual tax liability.

If I go at this as a 1099, though, that $24,000 stays in my pocket so long as my accountant and I do reasonable job of projecting my quarterly estimated tax payments. That's $24,000 I'd rather distribute through the year, rather than see again in April.

However, as a 1099, I also understand I need to pay the Self Employment Tax, incur the expense of my accountant doing my taxes 4 times a year, and likely some periodic legal representation.

I estimate the Self Employment Tax liability to be $19,000 - which isn't a trivial amount an estimated $9,952 Social Security and Medicare taxes as a W2.

So what are your thoughts, PF? I'm sure I'm overlooking some things, and maybe misunderstanding some others. But right now, I feel as though I'm in a stronger position going 1099 than I would be as a W2.",finance,1442627816

personalfinance,Need some help being an adult,"So, I'm 23 years old and currently living at home. I started a new job about a month ago, and make $75,000 in the state of MD. 
I'm going to get my first full paycheck come October, and could really use some advice on how to start handling my finances. 

I guess the first thing is: **tax exemptions**. Currently, I have 2 exemptions listed (don't know why). I'm probably going to change this to 1 or 0, and need some advice. Does the government get a set amount of money from me no matter my exemptions listed? I think at this rate, I may owe the government some money at the end of the year, having 2 exemptions listed. My net at the end of the month, minus my 401k (will get to that later), health insurance (only like $50/mo), and taxes, is **currently** going to be ~$4,300 (this is with 2 exemptions). I'm thinking I should change it to 1 exemption, and that way I will still probably get money at the end of the year, but wont be paying so much in taxes as 0 exemptions.

Second, and this is pretty specific to me I guess, is **private life insurance**. So apparently, my dad set up MetLife insurance for me and has been paying it since I was 2. He recently told me that I either need to start paying it now that I have a job, or it will get cancelled. This year's bill is $727.50. The insurance is worth $250,000 and I believe has about $40,000 paid into it already. I don't think I would mind paying it, but I get life insurance from my company, at 1.5x my salary. I also do not have a wife or any kids, and don't plan on it any time soon. According to him, it is worth keeping because eventually it will start to pay itself with its dividends (as it does for him...he said at this point he gets a check once a year with the left over money), because MetLife invests the money and puts it back into the policy. The ***total*** bill for the insurance is actually $980, but there is already a $252.50 dividend credit being applied to it. So should I keep it? Toss it?

My 401k/Retirement/Blah. So I guess I'm pretty fortunate in that my employer does a straight contribution of 10% salary into a pre-tax 401k fund. When I was doing the orientation work, I had their 401k people also put 5% of my salary into a Roth IRA (post-tax?). So all in all, I have about 15% going into retirement, with only 5% coming from me. Should I keep going like this? Increase? Decrease? Put more into the Pre-Tax?

Finally, as I mentioned in the beginning, I am currently living at home. My parents don't charge me rent or anything (yet :P), but I was considering moving out at the end of this year, beginning of next.

I have a joint account with my husband at a bank, but recently started a job and wanted to put part of my paycheck into a saving account with a better interest rate.

My credit report/history is clean; no identity theft suspected.

I ordered my report and they sent a letter saying my SSN is associated with another individuals account information, and they would like me to to send them an enlarged copy of my SS card, and they will alter their file to correct the misinformation. They also stated that they will accept other documentation provided by the Social Security Administration office.

I am not thrilled about sending enlarged copies of my SS card through the mail. Does anyone know what ""other documentation provided by the Social Security Administration office"" might be? Has anyone had this type of issue with ChexSystems?

* Pay off the last $27k of student loans we have (3.625% rate), leaving us debt free except mortgage

* Put money towards mortgage to get us closer to 20% equity and dropping PMI (3.25% rate, with $46k reduction needed to lose PMI)

* Stick it in retirement account

* Use it (plus a little more) as a 20% down payment on an investment property that would net ~$400/month

* something else!

Edit 3: You guys are the best! I appreciate all of the advice. I talked it over with my SO, and in the end we've agreed to stick to our original goal, which was to be debt-free. We'll apply it all to getting rid of the student loan debt.

personalfinance,"I'd like to set up a college fund for my nieces, but have no idea where to start...","**Preface:** I am by no means a dumb man, but I grew up in a working class family and never really had any exposure to financial planning. To give you an idea, my father’s idea of a savings plan was a Folger’s can stuffed with hundred dollar bills that sat on the shelf in the kitchen. When it comes to my own finances I’ve managed to do alright, and put a fair bit aside in the bank. But, recently, I’ve run into a situation and I’d like advice on the best way to handle it.

**Background:** I have two sisters, and recently both have had children. Both children are under a year old. Neither of my sisters is well off. One is a waitress and has been since high school. The other is a hairstylist. Neither of them have any inclination to go to school, or move from the town we grew up in. That’s fine. I love them and respect their choices. In high school I was kind of a geek and wound up making good enough grades that I got a partial scholarship to go to college. Coupled with a job on the side the scholarship wound up being enough that I got out of college with no debt. With the help of my college professors, my academic record, and some specialized training I was able to get into a fully funded PhD program in my field. About a year ago, partially due to family circumstances, I decided to opt out of the program with my Master’s degree. I moved back east and got a pretty good job in my field. I am now 26 and making about $85,000 a year from my job. Last year I made roughly another $10,000 a year from side projects / freelancing (a number that will likely grow as I establish myself / build a reputation). I live in an apartment in a fair part of town (not ritzy, but it’s safe) with my partner. She also has an MS (although in a different field). She’s currently unemployed, but once she is able to find a job, together we will likely be making in the $150,000 – $200,000 range. My partner was an only child, and doesn’t have any siblings. Both my parents and her parents have been gone for a long time now. It’s likely we will never have children of our own due to a medical issue. We live fairly modestly and don’t have any expensive hobbies. Other than rent, utilities, food, health insurance, and car insurance we don’t have any debt or recurring payments.

**Question:** I would like to set up a college fund to benefit my nieces, and potentially for any other children my sisters have in the future.  I am looking for input on the best way to go about this. I know there are a variety of options out there, but there are certain things that I would like it to be able to do.

* I don’t want my sisters to be know about it. If they must know about it, I don’t want them to be able to withdraw from the fund or liquidate it. Neither of them have ever been very good with money, and tend to live hand to mouth. I worry that if they may attempt spend the money on their own immediate needs rather than leaving it set aside for my nieces.
* My partner and I will be the primary contributors to this fund, but I’ve discussed the potential of doing something like this with some others in my family (my uncle and my half-brother) that would also like to contribute when they can.
* I want to make sure that the money goes toward their educational needs and living expenses during college.  I don’t want them to be able to spend it frivolously.
* If they finish college, I would like any leftover funds to become theirs in order help them get a foothold in life.
* If they choose not to go to college directly out of high school, I would like there to be a way for them to use it to pay for their education later in life.
* If they don’t go to college at all, I would like it so the money is set aside for any children my nieces may have to pay for their education.
* I need some way to make sure this is all implemented, even if something should happen to me or my partner.
* If something were to happen to me and my partner, I would like to be able to liquidate all our assets and incorporate them into the fund. At this point that wouldn’t be much, just what we have in the bank and the proceeds from anything we own. But, at some point it will likely include a house, stocks, mutual funds, etc.

At some point, I would like to sit down with a financial planner and discuss this, but I would like to go into it with at least a basic understanding of what’s going on so I don’t get taken for a ride. I have so many questions I don’t even know where to begin. I guess my basic questions are:

* Is there a pre-established way of doing something like this?
* If not, what’s the best way to do something like this? (i.e. what would I ask for)
* Is there a limit to how much I can set aside?
* What’s a good amount to set aside for this type of thing? Especially given that I don’t know how many children my sisters may have.
* Is there a specific type of financial planner or lawyer that is best to go to with this sort of thing?

I'm a grad student with some student loans. I'm teaching, so grad school isn't costing me a thing---instead I get paid about $1,600 a month. I've paid off all my unsubsidized loans, which leaves me with about $17,000 in loans that won't be accruing any interest until I graduate in about 3 years. Their interest rates are between 3.4% and 5.6%. Meanwhile, I've saved up about $3,000 that I can't see myself needing to spend while in grad school, and I should be able to make that number grow by about $400 per month.

This money is currently just sitting in my savings account and growing by 0.15% a year... is there a better place I can put it? I figure I'll probably want access to the money once I graduate, since the loans will be accruing interest faster than anything I'll be investing in.",finance,1442717239

I'm in school right now and have an unsubsidized federal loan of $3000 at 4.5%

My husband's income is our only regular income at the moment -- I quit my full time job to go to school -- but I still have some miscellaneous income from non-job sources. He has a car loan from before we were married. The balance is about $8,000 at 13%.

I had planned on making a payment on this loan of about $150. That way by the end of a calendar year, it will have accrued interest bringing it back to $3000, instead of increasing. (Technically it will be something like 2850 principal and 150 interest which will capitalize, but if the total is $3000 I'm in the same place as if I had made interest-only payments every month, right?)

However I'm wondering if it would be smarter to just put that $150 toward the car loan, so it's costing 4.5% instead of 13%. Is this right? (We are working on a plan to pay the car off as quickly as possible. I'll probably post a complete budget sometime next month.)

personalfinance,Getting a handle on student loans - questions about refinancing and avalanche attack order.,"My spouse and I recently sat down to really get a handle on our student loan debt. We've been doing a lot of research to better understand what out options are, what's feasible for us, and what's the most efficient financially. 

Two main questions, **should we look at refinancing** (and how), and should we be **paying down the highest interest *rate* first, or the account where we're currently paying the most on interest monthly**?

Our situation - combined income around $160 and we've got a decent 3 month buffer saved up. We've got a budget that we could always be better about tightening up, but overall we're pretty comfortable with our cash flow. 

We've got a total balance shy of $95k; $70k in variable private (3.62% - 5.24%) and $25k in fixed federal (4.5% - 6.8%, mix of Perkins, direct-sub, and direct-unsub). So far we've been paying the minimum on everything and a bit more on the two highest private rates, each about $17k with 5.24% and 4.24%. The federal loans have higher fixed rates but are all smaller balances ($2-5k each).

We've looked into refinancing a bit and am not sure if we'd get a better rate, if it'd be worth rolling in the higher rate federal accounts, of if it would even be worth it just for those two higher private accounts we're currently paying down faster. From our research on /r/personalfinance and /r/StudentLoans we've seen SoFi and RDB have been the most popular with rates just under 4%. I think we both have credit scores around mid/upper 700s. 

We're thinking about getting quotes with at least SoFi and RDB, but know that it will be a hard pull on our credit. Before we ask for quotes, should we be asking to refinance our higher-rate federal loans or leave them be to keep the better protections in case of emergencies? If 3 of our 6.8% federals are direct unsubsidized, should we treat them differently (I think direct sub and Perkins qualify for forebarance/deferment but do direct unsub not?)? Also, since two of the private loans are under 4%, should we only look to refinance the 4.24% and 5.24% rates?

**TL/DR Q1 - Refinancing**: 

* When applying to refinance loans through someone like SoFi and RDB, does it matter which loans you're trying to refinance? 
* Can you change up the options/amount/etc without having to do another hard pull? 
* Is there an optimal way to look for refinancing? 
* Should we look to anyone in addition/instead of SoFi and RDB?

We're trying to be as efficient as we can paying these loans down and it sounds like we should be using the avalanche method. We're a little confused though, should we be paying down the account with the highest interest rate first, or the one where we're paying the most in interest currently (so maybe not the highest rate but a larger principle)? While a few of our federal loans have the highest rate (6.8%), the balances are all $2-3k. We haven't been able to find the average interest paid monthly on the federal loans yet, but the interest on the $17 at 5.24% is about $100/month. 

**TL/DR Q2 - Avalanche Attack Order**: 

* Should we be paying down the account with the highest interest rate first, or the one where we're paying the most in interest currently?

My apartment is 43 sqm, the cheaper one is 18 sqm but with some smart compact living I think I could stomach the downsize.

Choosing the cheaper one would almost make me FI. Keeping my current one I'm looking at working for at least six more years.

From 9 years ago to 2 years ago I always thought that I would work until my deathbed because I liked programming so much.

But the 2 last years I have been feeling extremely burnt out and suffer from depression.

I'm thinking that switching to a cheaper apartment would free my mind and perhaps I could find joy again easier with this peace of mind.

I'm 27 years old btw. Am I crazy for lowering my living conditions to ""achieve"" the FI feeling as soon as possible? The cheaper apartment is in the same city and have about the same distance to my current job.

I do have 3 credit cards that I pay off in full each month as well with a credit rating of 770's according to Credit Karma.  My vehicle is paid for but does need some work (new muffler, tires).  So I am looking at that being my next expense (possibly around 1500 for the lot).  I have been thinking of buying a house because I'd like to get into real estate but the one I am interested in at the moment (beautiful downtown location) is out of my league I believe (they are asking 220,000).   I feel I am already doing quite well and on pace to pay off my loans within the next few years but I'd like to start having my money work for itself through some investments.  I bought ""The Intelligent Investor"" and want to look at learning about investing in stocks but as far as my plan of attack I'm kind of just doing what has always worked for me sprinkled in with some advice from people close to me.  My gut says pay off the student debt a.s.a.p but maybe I invest it in a house and go back to school on my work's dime?  I have thought about going into medicine or computer programming but don't feel that spark of passion with either.  it would just be another means to an end.  So...

personalfinance,Self-employed entrepreneur bringing in 6-figures without a financial strategy. Halp?!,"I contract for a few companies and consult and business has been great the past few months. I have my taxes dialed in outside help, but no real strategy for on-going financial planning. My work is very cerebral and involves essentially zero overhead. I work from home, coffee shops, etc. My software expenses total less than $100/year. 

I want to amass wealth inteilligently and am totally uneducated when it comes to what income bracket means what, how to handle equity arrangements in business deals, etc. 

Finance is one of my weakest points and I need to do some serious learning. I'd like to self-educate and hire whichever professional is best (financial planner? money manager?) but need help getting started. I read up on Dave Ramsey and went through his Total Money Makeover with great results - I have all my debts clearly lined up and have been knocking them down. 

To add complexity, here's my income:  
+ 25% as an employee with basic taxes withheld
+ 50% as a consultant, paid by one organization  
+ 5% from hourly contractor work by above organization (1099)  
+ 20% revenue share deals in organizations I work with  

I just don't know where to go from here. Specifically, I need help on:  
+ How do I setup a 401k by being mostly self employed? Any cool hacks for the 25% of my income I get from my employer?  
+ Should I be mindful of taxes being higher at higher income levels, and if so, does it sometimes make sense to make LESS so that I don't have to pay MORE overall in taxes?  
+ How should I be paying myself first? What does that look like?  
+ I have no credit card debt, no car loan. Should I keep any kind of balance on my credit card for credit score juicing?

financialindependence,"Let's be real: I'm a young physician and about to go from $51k/yr to ~$190k/yr, and I want to do it right","Hi Everyone, I'm the typical ""long time lurker, never post"" guy. I find /r/FI to be full of good information with quality responses and  I've debated jumping in to get to an idea of where I should go, but now I'm ready to commit.


I see reddit full of people in the tech industry, but don't see many people in medicine come out of the shadows to discuss finances. This bums me out because the finances of medicine seem to be drastically different in not only income, but also debt. Additionally, most physicians seem relatively loose with their money. So, I'm reaching out to anyone and everyone to get some financial advice that may be suited more for the changes I'm about to face. So here it goes... 


I'm about to walk into a very large annual salary, but while the majority of the population consider doctors to be ""rich"", they ignore the fact that the years of educational debt don't make it entirely true. I'm asking for a little guidance to: get out of debt as fast as possible all while making sound financial investments that will help me FIRE as soon as possible (goal at age 40 years old?). (Secretly, I want out of medicine in the traditional sense. Medicine is horribly over-regulated and it burns physicians out rapidly. I love medicine but would rather spend my time FIRE at a free clinic out of debt)

The Details:

Age: Soon to be 30

Kids: none 

Marital staus: single, although I have been dating my gf (a fellow physician) for &gt;4 years now, and marriage will likely be soon. And yes, she will be making the same jump in salary soon as well.


Debt:

Student Loans: -$270k at 6.2%

Credit Cards: Happily paid off every month on time

Private loan: $0 (I listed this to let you all I haven't just been throwing my monthly income away ha, I JUST paid off a $18k loan that was taken out to relocate ourselves, paid this off over the course of a year, had to bust my ass, but proud of myself. Thanks to your guys' numerous recommendations to others to get YNAB! This is only my second month of trying to build of an emergency fund)


Monthly expenses:

Rent: $675 

Now here's the situation with the home. There are ""physician loans"" available (0% down, no mortgage insurance), which we did under my gf's name only, and we co-habit ""our"" home. So I pay ""rent"" to her. The reason behind this is that you can only have one of these loans open at a time, and given that we aren't married, we decided to take advantage of these loans by placing this first home under her name, and the next will be under mine. This was to help facilitate our next purchase (by still being able to apply for the next loan without having to move out/sell the first, and to possibly retain the first/current home if we just so decided to do so). 

Utilities: half of monthly = ~$115/mo

Wifi: $75/mo

Cell phone: $63/mo

Cable: $22/mo

Netflix: $10/mo

Gym: $11/mo

Yard work: $80/mo

Student loan payment: $57/mo (currently income based, more on this below)

Car Insurance: avg $125/mo

Gas: $60-80/mo


So here's the deal with these student loans... They're all federal and all from medical school. I have no undergrad debt as I worked my ass off and lived at home during that time and paid it off as I went along (plus I went to a cheap state school). They've been consolidated through the federal program, as pay as you earn, and are at a fixed rate of 6.2% (ugh). The payments are income based to a max of 10% of income.

However, I'm currently about 3 years into the 10 year forgiveness plan. Meaning, if I continue to work at a not-for-profit employer, my remaining loans at the end of 10 years will be forgiven. 

Problem is, this is the federal government we're working with here, and who knows if this will still be possible in 7 years. Also, I'm not entirely sure I'll be staying with a not-for-profit employer over the next 7 years. But it's definitely a driving force to encourage me too. Poor calculations of the total I'll end up repaying if I stick with this plan is: Current money paid back ($600) + (7years x $19k/yr) = total repayment cost of $133.6k and a remaining $136.4k+interest will be forgiven (I could be very wrong on this).


Assets:

Car: $4500 (1999 4runner, and I love it) 

Cash: $5000 (in mixed checking/savings acct)

Currently no 401k, stocks, bonds, nothing

Home: None technically - see above - but our (""her"") current home is a $170k loan at 3.5% fixed. Estimated value $180k


Current income:

Primary job: $3050 per 4 weeks (salary, with horrible horrible hours, often 80-90 hrs per week) 

Second, third, and fourth side jobs (you read that right): all are ""as needed"" and therefore hours vary widely, but typically bring in ~$1000 additionally per 4 week period. However, I expect this to stop next month with zero additional income per month.


Projected soon-to-be income: 

Primary job: $190k annual salary pre-tax

I calculate around $123k annual after tax

Minus annual malpractice insurance est of $15k per year

Minus increase in student loan payments - 10% of gross income, so I estimate $19k per year (correct me if I'm wrong on that one) 

So realistically, I'm likely looking at a take home net annual salary of $89k.



Things I anticipate to happen in the next year or so (and future):

1) Purchase of a home (either as a second home or replacement for our first)

2) Getting married (I've got an awesome catch, plus she puts up with my crap)

3) We'll likely have children eventually (unlikely in the next year or two unless there is something I don't know)



I know about the standard build your emergency fund, pay into a 401k, IRA, and get Vanguard investments with leftovers. But what else??! What other investment ventures are there?


Should we sell our (her) current home? Keep it as a second home? Should I stick with the 10 year repayment plan for my loans, or is there a another reason why I should pay off these loans ASAP and forget about it? 
What would YOU do with this salary, where would you put it, what can you do to make the most out of it, all while getting your ass out of debt as rationally as possible and to be FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT??  


Please forgive me if this sounds like I'm trying to show boat. I'm just REALLY put off by how the physicians before appear to be trapped in a never ending hell of practicing medicine in a way they dislike and unable to retire, because they haven't been educated or made good decisions with their money. I don't want to be that guy. Ever.


(as a side note, I think about opening a microbrewery in the future, man I love beer... but not while I medicine, of course)

personalfinance,How many federal tax exemptions can I have?,"Arizona, USA  

I became employed at a livable wage (50k) after a period of unemployment. I need to generate a bit more money than what I regularly make for an apartment deposit among other things.

I have had my federal exemptions set to 9 in the past when my SO was briefly unemployed and I set them to 0 after a few months to catch up and still get a good tax refund.  

As a single person with no kids or dependents, what is the maximum federal exemptions I can have to temporarily bring in a bit more cash? 

EDIT: Yes, I'm talking about allowances. ADP (the payroll system used by my employer) calls them exemptions so I went with that. I wouldn't go the whole year with 9+ allowances, I just want to increase them temporarily so I can have less tax withheld now and pay it back later by decreasing my allowances to 0 before the year ends.  

Is there really a penalty for this? Once I get my W-2 and do my taxes I'll ultimately report 2 allowances and will ultimately have paid all the tax I should have paid and still get a refund, presumably a bigger refund if I maintain 0 allowances for a large duration of the year.",finance,1442793817

personalfinance,Is this entry on my credit report going to haunt me for the next 7 years? [long] [nsfw language],"[IMAGE from credit report.](http://imgur.com/TthJuj4) -- EDIT: Oh, well, I forgot to blur out the collection agency. Now you know.

---

Backstory: June of 2014, I moved out of an apartment complex and left for another state. About a year ago, I noticed this entry as a negative account on my credit report. The apartment complex would hang up on me when I called to ask what this charge was for. I tried for months. No return calls from voicemail. No return emails. No return letters. They have all my forwarding information and I had never received a single thing from them about this. Nothing. 

---

I sent a letter to the collection agency requesting validation and several other items, basically asking what the hell this is and why it's on my credit. They sent back ONLY an itemized list from the complex alleging that we didn't return the keys til 5 days after the lease (we physically left the state 2 hours after turning in our keys, impossible). They also said we left the apartment a wreck. I had just gotten the carpets professionally cleaned (have records) and spackled nail holes from paintings being hung, replaced light bulbs and put new batteries in smoke and monoxide detectors. Everything was pristine. I'm kind of a neat-freak anyway so this was no big change from the day-to-day. I even purchased a replacement interior door because our dog had scratched the old one up some when we accidentally closed her in the bathroom one afternoon while running errands. She didn't like being stuck. The maintenance manager and front office manager both told me to leave the raw door in the living room and they would attach it at no charge to us. The front office did the walkthrough and returned our deposits in full.

---

They told us they did not have a form for end-of-lease walkthroughs and that our deposit returned was indication all was well. I was a moron for taking them at their word. This was my first apartment. Lesson learned there. 

---

So, very very very long story short, here we are a year and a half later and I am moving to a new apartment complex. This one comes with a 40 page lease. I read EVERY.SINGLE.WORD before signing. I'm protected, they're protected. It's all good.

---

EXCEPT, they wouldn't lease to us while still ""owing"" the old complex. I understand their position. I explained what was going on and they told me that since they use a company called On-Site to do all their verifications for tenancy, my only option was to have the debt read ""closed"" on my report. 

---

Due to work circumstances, we had to have the lease signed ASAP. And I was getting nowhere with the debt collection agency. They had stopped responding to my mail requests for documents (pretty certain this is another illegal behavior!) and, with only days left to secure a new lease, I resorted to calling. My boyfriend ended up cursing some woman out because she was treating me like shit. Pretty standard for debt collectors, it seems. His cursing worked out, they let us settle for a percent of the debt (still way high!) and I have just considered this a very expensive, very hard lesson learned about covering our own asses in the future. I'm sick over having to pay this debt we DID NOT OWE and they know it - I'm sure it's a scam this slum was running - but it's paid, it's over and done with.

---

So now this [{image from above}](http://imgur.com/TthJuj4) is what that hit to my credit report looks like.  We got the new apartment, signed the lease, all set to move in in 2 weeks. STOKED! Great complex!

---

But now I have this fat, hideous blemish on my credit report. 

---

**How bad is it? Does this bode very badly for me in the years to come? Is there any way to have it retroactively removed by contacting attorney general of that state? Or credit bureaus or anything? If I shot myself in the foot by paying it, then fine, but the wound was necessary for my life right now.**

---

We don't plan to buy a house for another 5-8 years anyway and by then we'll have a sickeningly huge downpayment, so I'm not insanely troubled.

---

**But, yeah, any help, suggestions, CONSTRUCTIVE criticisms, etc. are very welcome.**

---

*I know I dun goofed by not protecting myself here. I get that. Please don't harp on me for it. I was a trusting idiot because I was operating from the naive perspective of ""now who would just go and tell lies like that?"". I'm already beating myself up all damn day everyday about it and trying to let that go and just learn the lesson. Moving forward.*

personalfinance,Real World Implications of an MBA,"Hi guys,

I'm interested to hear the opinion of people in this sub regarding the pursuit of an MBA. I'd like to keep discussion away from the actual merits of ""you're not guaranteed a job at the end, you don't know if you'll make $X amount like you think, your school isn't worth it, etc."" I'd like to propose a few assumptions for which I'd like to hear what people have to say.

Lets assume that I am considering going back to school full time for an MBA. The full cost of tuition, living expenses, books, etc. is set at $180,000 for two years. I will have absolutely no debt before I start, BUT, I will assume I will have basically no savings beforehand to apply towards it. So, lets assume I will have a net worth of $0. I would take out loans for the entire cost, either federal or private (whatever is better), and lets assume for now I won't be qualifying for any scholarships.

Next, let's assume that I will be making 135k a year immediately following my completion of the program. Lets just say that it will be 135k the first year, and by year 4 or year 5 it may be around 200k. Of course, this is all subjective and it could go either higher or lower depending on lots of different circumstances.

Now, how do you all feel about a situation like this. Is the ROI worth it? Of course, I would aggressively try and repay those loans and quickly as possibe...I may even be able to get into a situation where I am spending little to nothing on living (living with family, on the road for work 80% of the time) and if I make 135k a year, maybe I could even manage to put 75-100k of that back into loans within the first year or two...but I don't know how realistic that is and whether people actually pull that off.

The last assumption will be that the ALTERNATIVE to everything I just talked about, is to NOT go back to school, and go into the work force (it will be a career change from my current situation). Lets say that if I do that, I would probably be making about 90-100k a year most likely in a pretty expensive city. (Think NYC).

EDIT: Some good responses, thanks! I guess I should have explicitly stated this beforehand. I guess the biggest question I have is: HOW DO YOU PAY OFF 180K??? What does the life of someone making 125-130k a year look like, while paying of 180K?

Any advice on what someone should do in that situation to pay off their loans as quickly as they can? I'd like to hear all your opinions on how you feel about the situation as a whole. 

Again, I'd rather not debate those things that can be very subjective like I mentioned, but would rather talk about this specific situation. I appreciate everything you guys do in this sub so thanks!!",finance,1442800867

personalfinance,"Two jobs, going back to school and need to choose one....what do I do??","Hey redditors,

I'm new on here so apologies if I misformat or am all over the place oranything. So I'm 20 years old, live in an apartment, have 2 jobs, and intend on going back to school in January. Here's my mothly expenses (the set-in-stone ones):

Rent (utilities included)- $315

Auto Loan- $321 (been paying 330)

Auto Insurance- $152 (cheapest I can find)

Student Loan- $50/month on a $2,750 loan

Phone w/ 2gb data- $45

Gas- ~$80

Groceries- never the same, usually around $50-$60

Netflix- $9

So, using mint I usually spend on average around $1600 total. After both my jobs, I tend to make around $2200 on average. Now, that may not seem bad for a 20 yr old but I'm literally killing myself working so much. +/- 70 hour weeks in 2 manufacturing jobs. So here are the job descriptions:

Job A: $12//hr full-time... roughly 1464 net income a month@40hrs/week

Job B: $16.14/hr part-time... roughly 800 net income a month@~24hrs/week

So, long story short... I hate Job B. Maybe in part because I am always exhausted due to lack of sleep but also because the job just sucks. I load trucks and there's no A/C and it's literally 95-105 degrees everyday in the summer and 30-50 in winter. I don't particularly get along with the people there...but there's no conflict either, just not necessarily the people I'd like to associate with.
On the other end....I enjoy (for the most part) Job A. A/C, work at my own pace, not too physical and just physical enough, decent people, good friends there, been with the company 1.75 years and have a ever so slim possibility of being hired on (I'm a long-term contractor) and essentially getting a pay-raise for what I already do to probably somewhere between $14-$16/hr. 

So...with me going back to school in January of 2016, I will obviously need to quit one of my jobs and have a full time position at the other. I can probably go full-time at Job B if I ask. So...do I sacrifice enjoying my work and friends for roughly $800 more a month ($200 or so more a week)? Or stick with my current stable position and budget tighter to focus on school. Job B is also twice the distance and I am putting WAY too much mileage on my car as is (I've had it for 5 months at 22 miles and it has 10,000 miles on it). 

Also, as a side question.. I have roughly about 7 grand to my name. Would it be wise to pay off my student loan in full now and use that 50 a month towards my auto loan? Or what lol. Interest rate is like 3% or something on the student and %8.2 on the auto loan.

personalfinance,"(GER) - I, M/21, will soon finish my bachelor degree. Need advice on employment and the start of my ""serious"" worklife.","I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while now. Reading about mistakes which have consequences into the far future made me want to ask you, the experienced, for advice.


**My person:**

I'm currently studying technical management in a small city in Germany. If things run according to my plan, I'll be rewarded with a bachelor of science in about 12 months. The main focus of this study is the leading of companies, management of projects and general business studies. I specialised on riskmanagement (financial mathematics, which I always had a favor for). Also there has been a ""practical semester"" where i have been working for a big company for 6 months. So I've been in a internship which led to a (pretty) good job reference. I'm honestly a bit fed up with university and crave for work, a own flat, a daily routine. So starting a master is no possibility for me.


**My plans:**

I fell in love with the city Hamburg (1.8 million residents) while working there the past half year. Therefore moving there is one of my highest priorities during my search for a job. I've planned to send out dozens applications which will hopefully lead me to 5, 6 job interviews. I will aply for everything I could imagine being fitting for me, since I, to be honest, have not yet found my real ""vocation"". 


**My questions:**

I've been very sloppy during the first months at university which will lead to an extra semester and a lot of hard work to catch up on failed exams.

I thought about waiting one more semester, since only if I manage to pass every exam I planned in this current semester I have a realistic chance on finishing in one year (scared to get employed and then can't hold parameters for not finishing university in the time expected).


* What kind of employment is the ""right"" one for me? An internship? Trainee position? ""Normal"" job?

* How is the payment going to be handled? The field in which I'll start will probably be payed pretty high, ranging from good 5 digits up to the south end of 6 digits. But since this will not be my salary as a fresh from university 21 year old ""kid"" what can i expect? What to mind?

* Also want to have insight in a few different fields/jobs. Is hopping to a different job going to benefit/handicap my chances on the work market? Also, will this have influence on salarays terms?

* Any other information you'd loved to have while standing at my point at life?

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation: Good idea?,"Hey all,

My wife had 6 figures of student loan debt between her undergrad and graduate careers.  I consolidated mine a long time ago at 1.75%, and only have about 15k left.

We're in a pretty good financial place, we save about 30-40% of our income per year and we make a lot of money.  Enough that her loans cannot be deducted.

If we worked at it we could probably retire all her loans in a year or two.  My question is, does refinancing them all save us money even if we do that or perhaps we don't bother if the loan rates are below 4%?  Here's the details:



Loan | Balance  | Starting Bal | Rate
---|---|----|----|----|----
Fed Sub | 640.93 | 4375 | 0.17
Fed Sub | 422.65 | 35000 | 0.4
Citi Graduate | 17406.70 | 20000 | 2.75
Citi Graduate | 8318.65 | 9258 | 4
Citi Graduate | 19156.09 | 30700 | 4.88
Fed UNSub | 25748.06 | 41000 | 6.55


I was thinking I'd try to refinance the bottom 3 into one consolidation.  If I do that, is there any easy way to ensure I get the best rate?  We've gotten a lot of junk mail from SoFi and their rates look pretty compelling.

personalfinance,Is it better to settle or pay in full?,"Hey, PF!  I could use some help if you don't mind.  I made a throwaway account because people know my real username and I'm a bit embarrassed about this situation.

I'm currently unemployed and last week I find out I'm being sued for the debt of a credit card that I couldn't afford to make payments on.  My wife and I had to make some tough choices about where the little money we had was going to go and we may have made the wrong choice.  That doesn't change where we are now, though.

My wife has a life insurance policy that we can take a loan from.  There is no time limit to pay it back it's at a 2% interest rate when we do pay it back.  For obvious reasons we didn't want to use this, but now that we're being sued we figured we're not going to find a better option to come up with that kind of money.

Here's the question.  The law firm offered me a settlement amount that's $1,500 less than the full balance of the debt.  Is it better to take the settlement or pay in full?  What's the difference on our credit score from a settlement versus paying in full?  Are there any other things I need to know through this ordeal?  

I have until Thursday to call the law firm back to tell them what we're going to do, the court case is set for the 30th of this month, and I have until the end of October to pay whatever it is we choose to pay.  I could pay monthly installments, but I don't know why I would if I have access to the full amount?

Thank you all so much for your help!

EDIT:  Thank you all so much for the advice.  As many of you have pointed out, my credited is already screwed, so I should go ahead and take the settlement.  So, our plan is to negotiate the best settlement that we can, get it in writing, and send a check with a receipt on arrival and keep it FOREVER.  After that, I'll start studying links in the info bar on repairing my credit.  Thanks again everyone!",finance,1442849970

I also have two small auto loans at around 4% interest rates. One for $3500 and one for $7000. 

I'm ready to buy a single family home. While discussing options with my real estate mortgage guy he said my best option might just be to take out a home equity loan against my rental, pay off my two auto loans and use the rest to pay for the down payment of the house and closing costs without anything coming out of my pocket. 

This would eliminate my car loans, put me in a new house and give me a lower interest loan that would be paid off in roughly the same amount of time. All with basically the same payment.

It sounds great on paper, but how terrible of an idea is that in real life?

personalfinance,"Refinance or Ride out paying MIP another 2.5 years, Florida home purchased for $365k in March of 2013 on FHA loan.","Hi There,

2 redditors seeking advice from the collective.  I am really bad at Math, my wife is not too great either.  All of this refi/MIP/Loan-To-Value is a little confusing as well as ambiguous.  Hope for some clarification with your guys' help!

Our Loan/House:

FHA %3.5 rate on Initial loan value of $358k and owe about $340k atm

Current Home value is around $450k ( and steadily rising, thankfully )

Problem:

Paying $360/month in stupid MIP.

Refi is around $5k upfront costs and out Rate will go to %3.85-4.0

We will pay about $11k in MIP between now and our 5 year anniversary of our loan.

What should we do? 

The refi just seems terrible because even though I am not a mathematician, I am pretty sure we are going to be out a fuck ton of cash if we start a new 30 year loan @ %3.85-4, more than the $11k more we will pay in PMI.

We have found writing about our loan that sounds promising, I will put that [here](http://themortgagereports.com/7570/fha-mip-cancel):

""Typically, a 30-year FHA mortgage with 3.5 percent down payment will reach 78% LTV in around 11 years. A 15-year fixed with 3.5 percent down would reach 78% LTV in around two years.

So, for homeowners with a mortgage from June 2013 or earlier, one option to end FHA MIP is to just wait it out. Eventually, mortgage insurance ends.""

This seems great, but our lender, Penny Mac, along with other lenders we have talked to about the refi cant/wont give us a clear answer.  If the above is true, come march 2018, we get an appraisal and we are good, MIP gone!  But when we talk to the lenders they are telling us that it's not straight LTV %78, but the loan needs to be at a %78 LTV based on us having paid down THAT much principal!  I cant find this in writing but they are telling us this is what they are selling us on.  I dont trust them.  The banks want us to keep paying the stupid MIP and new lenders just want us to refi and take our money.

Anyone that can offer some insights as to our dilemma would be greatly appreciated.  And sorry in advanced if the answers are in the math but my brain is just a potato when it comes to all this.  Thats why I became a Firefighter... very little math involved!

Thanks,

Marc

Canceling FHA's Annual Mortgage Insurance Premiums

o Cancellation based on Initial Amortization Schedule: Effective for all loans closed on or after 

January 1, 2001, FHA's annual mortgage insurance premium will automatically be canceled-once 

the unpaid principal balance, excluding the upfront MIP, reaches 78 percent of the lower of the 

initial sales price or appraised value based on the initial amortization schedule and pursuant to 

instructions contained in ML 00-38. Although the annual mortgage insurance premium will be 

canceled as described, the contract of insurance will remain in force for the loan's full term. This 

mortgage insurance premium cancellation provision applies only to loans insured under the Mutual 

Mortgage Insurance (MMI) fund. The MMI fund does not include mortgages on condominiums or 

Section 203(k) rehabilitation loans, among others. 

Once the mortgage amortizes to a loan-to-value ratio of 78 percent, collection of the annual MIP 

will cease. FHA will determine when the mortgage reaches the amortized 78 percent loan-to-value 

threshold based on the contract interest rate (initial note rate on adjustable rate mortgages) and the

loan-to-value information provided to CHUMS by the originating lender, and will cease billing the 

servicing lender accordingly. FHA's calculation of the 78 percent threshold will be predicated on 

the loan amount excluding the upfront MIP. 

Effective May 1, 2001, FHA will provide the date at which the annual MIP will end. The 

cancellation date will be available to lenders via the Case Query Screen located in the FHA 

Connection Single, Family Origination section and the Portfolio and Advance Notice reports 

located in the FHA connection SF Servicing section. Lenders utilizing HUD's Frame Relay will be 

able to obtain the same information through the Portfolio Report and Advance Notice applications. 

o Borrower Initiated Cancellation: In addition to mortgages that reach the 78 percent loan-to-value 

ratio threshold through initial scheduled amortization, borrowers can also request through their 

lenders cancellation of the collection of the annual mortgage insurance premium for those 

mortgages that reach the 78 percent threshold in advance due to prepayments (principal 

curtailment). Those loans reaching the 78 percent loan to value threshold sooner than projected 

(but not sooner than five years from the date of origination except for 15-year term mortgages) due 

to advanced payments of principal will have the annual premium collections canceled upon the 

servicing lender submitting supporting information to FHA following the borrower's request 

provided that the borrower has not been more than 30 days delinquent on the mortgage during the 

previous twelve months. As part of their annual disclosures to homeowners, servicers are to notify 

borrowers of their option to cancel the annual MIP in advance of the projected date by making 

additional payments of mortgage principal. As stated in ML 00-38, the 78 percent threshold will 

be predicated only upon the initial sales price or appraised value, whichever was less. 

Effective May 1, 2001, FHA will also provide the amount the loan balance must reach in order to 

cancel the annual MIP. FHA will determine the loan balance at which the 78 percent threshold is 

met by excluding the upfront MIP. The required loan balance data will be available to lenders via 

the Case Query Screen located in the FHA Connection Single Family Origination section and the 

Portfolio and Advance Notice reports located in the FHA connection SF Servicing section. 

Lenders utilizing HUD's Frame Relay will be able to obtain the same information through the 

Portfolio Report and Advance Notice applications. Servicing lenders should use the formula 

provided by SFPCS-Periodic described in Mortgagee Letter 98-22.",finance,1442863357
Bitcoin,Here's what everyone seems to be missing regarding the node centralization debate:,"The number of full nodes on the Bitcoin network has dropped from 10k to 6k over the last couple years.  Small block size advocates insist that raising the block size limit will aggravate this trend toward centralization.  

Large blockers insist that making the network more useful is more important than maintaining high levels of network decentralization.  

But both sides seem to ASSUME that increasing block size will cause more centralization, and the debate thus centers around whether the enhanced usefulness is worth the ""cost"" of a more centralized network. 

But...will larger blocks increase centralization?

I'm not so sure.  The more useful the network, the more people and organizations have a vested interest in it's maintainance. Businesses, governments and NGOs who are dependent upon the block chain for certain aspects of their day-to-day operations will have a built in incentive to ensure that their competitors don't gain undue influence over the network.  

While raising the block size limit might make it too expensive for certain INDIVIDUALS in certain areas of the world to operate a full node, the cost for a business or a government (whether local, state, federal) or an NGO to do so will always be TRIVIAL.  Every Russell 2000 company could run a full node at a truly immaterial cost to its bottom line.  That's 2000 nodes right there.  Every city and county government could do the same.  Every college and University.  Every for profit or nonprofit business with revenues of more than a few million likewise.  That's many tens of thousands of potential nodes, and that's just in the US alone.

Seeing the US take such a lead in nodes, what are other country's and their businesses, especially more aggressive and hostile ones, going to do?  They are going to operate nodes themselves.  And they will incentivize businesses within their borders to do the same, perhaps even by offering up tax incentives or the like.   


Tl;dr--Making the Bitcoin network more useful provides an inherent incentive for those organizations who use it to run full nodes, and the cost for them to do so will ALWAYS be trivial.  The more business, governments, universities, and NGOs use it, the more nodes we will thus have.  Competition among businesses and governments will ensure that no single or small group of entities gain control over any meaningful number of nodes.  In short, raising the block size INCREASES decentralization, contrary to the conventional wisdom on both sides of the debate.",cryptocurrency,1442863860

personalfinance,How am I doing?,"Hi All, 

I was wondering if anyone could provide me with some financial direction. I don't have too many financial wizards close to me, so I thought I'd reach out here. I just turned 23 years old and I graduated college in May of 2014. I work at a Medical Software company and live with my parents rent free. Below are some numbers. 

Total monthly income: $2690

Federal Student Loan payment: $329 a month, with 28k remaining. I pay the minimum.

Private Student Loan payment: $1000 a month. My mother pays $1000 a month as well. Our minimum payment is $685, so we're paying it off at an advanced rate. There is $52k remaining on this loan. 

I have $5,000 dollars saved, and another $2,000 dollars in a vanguard roth IRA. I have no car payment, and pay around $75 a month for car insurance, $40 for a cell phone, and $200 in gas (I drive a lot for work). I have an active social life and a girlfriend who lives in NYC, so I go over budget frequently, but have consistently been able to pay the $1329 to my loans without dipping into savings. 

I have stopped contributing to my Roth IRA and savings account. 6 or so months ago, I was only paying $500 to the private loan and contributing the other $500 to the roth and savings account. I feel it's more important to pay off the private loan, and if my mother continues to contribute the 1000 a month she has been, we'll pay off this loan in less than three years. 

I suppose I'm just looking for some direction here. I'm the only one of my friends with student loan debt, (they are mostly from wealthy families) and the only one who still lives at home. I'm very okay with this fact, because I'm able to maintain an active social life, while improving the probability that I'll be completely debt-free before my late twenties. After I turned 23, I began to think more about buying a house, retirement, and my future children's college tuition. I come from a very middle class family with three children that have similar college debt to mine. I want to have a better life than my parents, not out of spite, but out of respect for all of the opportunities they have provided me with. In a year, I could leave my current job for another making around 60. My company historically underpays employees, and many leave the company and nearly double their salary.

I also have been putting money towards an associate stock purchase plan that has a current value of about $12K, which I will no longer be putting money towards after this quarter is over.  Other than that, I really don't have anything else in my back pockets.

I have a car loan of about $20K, which the car is worth about $26-27K.  I intend on selling the car and putting the extra money towards a reliable, but less sexy vehicle to free up some monthly income.  I try to pay more than the minimum towards the loan payments each month, usually around $400.  Its a Jeep wrangler and I've had a Jeep for as long as my daughter has been around.  She always used to point out other Jeeps on the road when we were driving around together, so yeah, its been hard to get away from the brand.

My student debt has earned me a B.S. in Computer Information Systems and an MBA... from DeVry, but anyway it got me my current job.  I have been with the company for over 5 years and I could definitely qualify for a much higher paying position at one of our clients or another vendor in the market, which is the plan but I need to block some time to get my resume and such together.  Not uncommon for associates from this company to get a job at one of our clients for a 20-30% pay bump.  There are also those who head into consulting and make even more than that.

My net worth right now if you add in what I can sell my car for/savings/ETF's/Roth IRA and ROTH 401k is about -$10k. If I keep up with my aggressive payments, I should be 100% debt free by May 2018, at the age of 27, and I should hit net 0 in about 9 months. I owe it entirely to PF for helping me get this far! Thank you for sharing this journey with me!

**EDIT:** Thank you so much for all the support and for sharing your own stories of debt and suffering :p. **Here is a jpeg to a numberless version of my motivational poster: http://imgur.com/iJYFe8n.** Would love for anyone that uses it to send me some progress shots :D.",finance,1442875273
personalfinance,Looking for advice on modifying tax withholding after getting married and adopting a daughter this year,"I'm getting married in the next few days, and I'm looking to answer a couple tax-related questions:

* Am I correct in my current evaluation of my federal tax situation?
* If so (or even if not), how can I fix it to minimize my return for this year given my current tax status?

Some background: I haven't really taken the time before to go through and calculate my withholdings for my taxes and properly adjust my W-4, so I wanted to make sure that I'm doing at least the calculation part correctly. However, I honestly don't know how that translates into the W-4 and its allowances, and I also don't know if large adjustments are allowed by the IRS.

My situation is this:

* Estimated taxable wages by end of year is around $76k (doesn't include deductions, will probably be less depending on how much my new insurance premiums are through my company's benefits)
* Current taxable wages earned is $55,723.76
* I'll most likely only take the standard deduction since itemizing will almost certainly be less than the standard deduction
* My fiancee does not have a job, and will not be able to get one for the rest of the year
* I will also be gaining a dependent besides my fiancee, she has a daughter
* This daughter will not yet be enrolled in any kind of daycare or with a babysitter since my fiancee will be staying home with her until she gets her work permit
* My total YTD federal withholding is already $10,544.21
* My last check had $646.35 taken out for federal taxes
* I am paid twice a month

So even prior to the standard deduction, calculating my taxes using the 2015 tax brackets and the $76k, that puts me at $10,587.50 owed in taxes. After my increased insurance premiums (which will be around $1,500 more through the end of the year) and the deduction get taken out of the $76k, I believe that I've already paid my taxes for the year and then some, is this correct? Are there any other credits or exemptions that I'm missing, particularly relating to our daughter?

If this is the case, how far can I go with my W-4 to minimize my refund, and how does that translate into the changes I need to make? I'm not familiar with how the allowances work and how it factors into my current situation. Can someone show me a sample calculation for this or help my calculate mine?

Thanks in advance. I'm trying to get this figured out so I can fix it before payroll processes on the 30th.",finance,1442877738

worldpolitics,US Federal Reserve Bank - Not Raising Interest Rates - A Sense That The World's Major Central Bank Has No Real Plan or Perspective,"22 September 2015

The decision by the US Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates at its meeting last week has added to the growing uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets and contributed to the sense that the world’s major central bank has no real plan or perspective, but is deciding policy on the run.

The fallout from the Fed’s decision has exposed divisions among the financial elites. On the one hand there is the view that the Fed decision was necessary amid concerns that the downdraft from lower growth in China and other so-called emerging markets could tip the global economy into recession. On the other, there is criticism that Fed decisions are being made in response to stock market turbulence, creating the conditions for major problems in the future.

Richmond Federal Reserve president Jeffrey Lacker, the lone dissenter among the twelve Fed officials who made the decision, said exceptionally low interest rates for an economy with increasing consumption was “unlikely to be appropriate.” It deviated from the way the Fed had made decisions in the past and was dangerous because such departures were “risky and raise the likelihood of adverse outcomes.”

His views were echoed by St Louis Fed president James Bullard, who does not have a vote on the Fed policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which made the decision. He said it was time to increase rates and policy should not be made in reaction to market turmoil.

Bullard said that had he been a voting member of the FOMC, he would have dissented from the decision not to raise the benchmark federal funds interest rate. There was a “powerful case to be made that it’s time to normalise interest rates,” he declared.

The Fed could not permanently boost stock prices, he argued, adding that the strategy should be to increase rates gradually, which would provide flexibility. The alternative was not to move until absolutely necessary, and that was “very much a volatility-inducing kind of scenario.”

The counter argument was advanced by Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart, who voted in favour of the decision. He cited recent market volatility, while indicating that he would be the “first” to vote for an interest rate rise as “things settle down.”

Far from settling down, financial markets and the global economy more broadly are being wracked by increased turbulence under the impact of falling growth in China and the fears of capital flight from emerging markets.

In her press conference following the decision, Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen referred to the uncertain international outlook produced by concerns over growth in China and “volatility in financial markets,” leading to an increase in risks.

The market initially responded to the decision with a spike, but then fell into negative territory once the implications of Yellen’s remarks were considered. It rose again on Monday—the Dow was up by 125 points—evidence of continuing turbulence.

A report published last week in the Financial Times made clear that many of the conditions that led to the financial crisis of 2008 have returned. According to the article, the volume of “mega deal” mergers so far this year has reached an all-time high, exceeding the levels reached in the dotcom bubble and in the years leading to the crash. The total value of attempted $10 billion-plus transactions has now reached $1.19 trillion, beating the previous record set in 1999 on the eve of the dotcom collapse.

Lack of investment in the real economy means that companies seek to maintain and increase shareholder value through essentially parasitic operations—takeovers, mergers and share buybacks—in areas such as pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and telecommunications, financed through the low-interest rate regime of the Fed.

The degree to which market valuations have soared was underlined by an analysis of the expansion of the French telecom group Altice, which has taken over the US firm Cablevision. According to one analyst cited in the report, the stand-alone value of Cablevision was about $8 per share, but Altice paid $34.90.

The fact that such deals depend on an unending supply of ultra-cheap cash from the Fed and other central banks is the source of the tremendous pressure generated to continue the low-interest rate regime, whatever might be the longer-term consequences.

However, those consequences are looming larger in the considerations of those calling for a shift in interest rate policy.

Writing in the Financial Times, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England policy committee, said that seven years into a “recovery,” central bankers needed to explain “why the interest rate playing field is still so heavily tilted to borrowers.” If interest rates could not rise now, when could they? There was always a reason for not raising rates, but monetary policymakers were timid, lions that had lost their roar.

“Central bankers,” he continued, “appear to lack a clear strategy for monetary policy.” A realistic policy would be to gradually lift rates, so that the debate would be over the pace and extent of any increase, not whether it should take place at all.

Other critics say the non-action by the Fed, instead of lessening volatility in financial markets, has actually increased it. According to Kevin Adams at Henderson, a British asset manager, the Fed decision was “frustrating” because it means “more uncertainty, more complexity and potentially more confusion.”

While the low interest rate regime significantly benefits parasitical financial activities, it has an adverse impact on pension and other insurance funds, which invest heavily in government bonds and other secure assets. But with the return on these assets being kept down to extraordinarily low levels, the viability of these financial institutions, which have formed a pillar of the financial system over decades, is being called into question. Their liabilities are rising, while the returns they receive on their investments are under increasing downward pressure.

Hence the calls for a return to a more “rational” policy. But the reality is that neither the Fed nor any of the other central banks have such a policy at hand. This is because the crisis of 2008 was not primarily the result of a policy failure, but represented a breakdown in the mode of capitalist profit accumulation. With returns in the real economy in decline, the chief source of profit accumulation has become the growth of parasitism in financial markets.

While the value of American shares has increased by $17 trillion since the bottom of the market in 2009, investment remains at historically low levels, as corporations sit on record amounts of cash, estimated to be as much as $2 trillion for non-financial companies.

According to the International Monetary Fund, the central problem in the global economy is that investment levels are still some 25 percent below where they were before the financial crisis, with no sign of any upturn. The deepening malaise of the global economy caused by this breakdown is revealed in global trade figures, a key indicator.

In the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, global trade plummeted—at one point falling at a rate comparable to the contraction in the early 1930s. But then it recovered. However, the recovery petered out in 2010, and since then it has been rising at an annual rate of just 2 percent, well below the level of 6.5 percent in the years before the crisis.

A recent study by the Reserve Bank of Australia has pointed to one of the central reasons. It noted that business investment is usually the most trade-intensive component of demand. However, “the continuing weakness in business investment … is likely to have slowed growth in global trade in the post-crisis period.”

Writing on the Business Spectator web site, columnist Callam Pickering noted that global trade growth would remain subdued unless business investment returned to pre-crisis levels and global uncertainty was lower. “Neither scenario is likely in the near term, particularly with regard to business investment,” he noted.

This points to the fact that the inability of the Fed and other central banks to devise a coherent policy and their obvious fear that even a small rise in interest rates could set off a financial storm are rooted in fundamental shifts in the very foundations of the global capitalist system.",finance,1442914858

personalfinance,"Receiving $2.5k inheritance - do I attack current debt lump sum, or is this an opportunity to learn better cash management (while attacking debt)?","Here's the shorthand - 

I've accrued around $3,500 worth of debt, and have received my $2,500 inheritance from a relative.  

I am wondering what the best course of action would be - 

* Pay off my Credit Card debt by $2,000 and hold $500 in my bank account?
* Pay off my Credit Card debt by $250/bi-weekly or monthly, while maintaining a larger balance in my bank account.  

I essentially live paycheck to paycheck with an estimated income of $1,100/Bi-weekly.  $1,500 of the debt came from a personal line of credit from my bank *(basically so I could pay my bills on time as the due dates approached)*.   The remaining $2,000 is via a Credit Card.  

In short, I am curious if there is any benefit to potentially learning better cash management by holding a larger portion of the inheritance and paying off my debt in increments, or if I should throw the lump sum at the debt.  

My worry is that if I throw too much at my debt without having that ""Emergency Fund"" *(I know that isn't necessarily the correct terminology).* - I could essentially dig myself into the same hole in the short term.

Also, which area of debt should I focus on mitigating initially *(personal line of credit has the higher interest rate, but unclear if I focus 100% of my efforts at Debt A then subsequently focus on Debt B... or more of a balance around 80/20% respectfully)*?

I've been lurking here for some time and y'all have been amazingly helpful without my having to ask a single question.  In fact, you helped me get my credit to the point of being able to buy a house this year, so thanks for being awesome!

Now for my first post.  When I was in law school, I went to an urgent care center for strep.  I paid my co-pay at the visit and the office failed to timely bill my insurance.  Rather than abiding by their contract with my insurance company, they billed me for the full amount and (I think purposefully) sent the bill to a former address that no longer had a forwarding order as I'd moved for school over a year prior (this wasn't the address listed on my intake forms and wasn't even associated with me in any way by that time).  I found out this all happened when I got a collections call and contacted my health insurance to figure out why I was getting billed beyond my co-pay.  They explained it to me and informed me the doctor no longer had any right to get paid for that date of service per his contract with them.  So I call the collections agency back, they agree to remove it from my credit report and I stop hearing from them.  

Later that year, I pulled my credit report and the negative item was still present.  I disputed it with the reporting agencies and they removed it, but it keeps coming back.  For the past couple years, I've just continued to dispute it periodically to get it off again, but I know it's keeping my score down all the same.  The people I've talked to at the reporting agencies have been of little help and although I've done some research into consumer credit law to find some legal options, I live in Texas and the debt was incurred in MO, which would make doing anything from a legal perspective on my own complicated at the very least.  I've been lucky so far that I've requested credit while the negative item wasn't present.  When I bought my house, I was sweating bullets the whole time afraid that one of the inquiries would pull it up and tank my chance at a decent interest rate (or getting a mortgage at all).  Other than pursuing a legal remedy, is there anything I can do to make the removal permanent?  I understand collections companies aren't supposed to do such things, but working for the judge who handled collections actions taught me that those companies don't really care about those sorts of regulations.  Am I talking to the wrong people at the reporting agencies?  Is it worth it to hire a local MO lawyer in the long run despite the up-front costs?  

To this point, I've had one late payment my entire life and I feel like my credit score doesn't show this.  I'm also afraid of small dings such as hard inquiries that are necessary to continue building my credit because it's just on the cusp of being good and small changes could knock it down to mediocre.

personalfinance,"23 Years old, failed business, returning to school, 10k in credit card debt and 20k from student loans","Hey guys,

I will just come out and say this, I am not good at handling money. It seems that any dollar I have falls through my finger tips. And with that said, I have a short story.

So I got myself into a predicament. Without going into too much details, I graduated college in the architectural drafting field two years ago. I became a in house drafter making a decent living for myself. I did my contracting business from architects who needed plans drawn, revised, relined, etc. I was working roughly 60 hours a week from home and making around 50k a year combined my salary with hers(drafters normally don't make a whole lot of money). This was awesome to me for my first startup in the field. My car got totaled(not my fault) and the other driver's insurance left me with a decent amount of money which I put on a new car along with a bit of savings.

This went on great for about a year and a half. The architects moved or closed shop, and well, a lot of my my business went with it.

In the past 6-8 months, my business tanked, my ex fiance left me, and I couldn't afford to live. Rent wasn't cheap, neither was paying off my student loans. I already had about 3k in credit card debt(mainly from overhead of the startup, computer, software, etc.) that was being paid off rapidly until my business tanked. My ex fiance racked up several thousand on my credit card before she left. Part of that was repairing her car transmission, which wasn't cheap. So she ended up with new stuff, a repaired car, and a new purse. She didn't like me ""nagging"" to her about how we, or I, didn't have money to support this lifestyle. So she left.

For 4 months I was alone, cold, starving, barely paying rent, and struggling to find work. At that time, I had to pay to eat, gas, and groceries on what remaining balance I had on my credit cards. I couldn't find work elsewhere in my field. I checked indeed daily, made phone calls, you name it. It ended when I called my parents and admitted my failure to them. I then decided to go back to school in a computer related field, but that will only add onto my student loans. They agreed to let me live with them and sleep on the couch until I graduate, but I need to pay off my car.

I am trying to pay at least 300 a month for my current credit cards. I have a job making 10/hr, working around 25 hours a week, which isn't easy. $1,000 a month, $12,000 a year before taxes. I have a car note that cost 300 a month plus insurance. I still have netflix and spotify that I use daily. My phone bill, because I canceled my other plan and everything else ended up to be about $100/mo. Student loans are also $100 a month. My job and school are real close, so instead of spending $300 a month on gas alone, like at my old place, I am only spending about $100 a month. I put recreation to cover netflix, spotify, and marijuana(legal in my state). **e: To be honest, I am not sure about my credit card debt interest rates. All I know is I have two of them, one has $4,000 (max $4,500) and the other is $6,000(max $8,000).**

Credit Cards - $200/mo

Car note - $300/mo

Phone bill - $100/mo

Recreation - $75 /mo

Gas - $100/mo

With this, I am barely making ends meet. Is there any way for me to make money on the side while I'm in college? Is there ways I can cut back? I am tied to this cellphone contract for a while. School is stressful enough as it is. I'm only doing it like this for a few years until I can graduate, and I've been in school for about a month and it is already stressing me out beyond belief. And having the freedom of weekends really sucks now when friends want to hang out and I cant because I don't have any money. What is the best way to dig myself out of this mess? Or am I just fucked?

Thank you everyone and have a good day!",finance,1442958525

personalfinance,"I filed bankruptcy, have $130,000 in defaulted Student Loan debt, and didn't finish my degree. What can I do?","**First a little backstory...**


I was a good student in high school and got good grades. I went to my first choice for business school (albeit not ultra-selective) and spent more time partying than I did studying or attending class.  On top of this, I took many courses that were unrelated to my degree (like Latin). I wasted huge amounts of money behaving this way and managed to fail classes that were central to my degree. 


In an attempt to get my act together, I moved back home, transferred to the local state college and started working full-time, 9-to-5 in IT, while trying to move towards a new degree.  Many of the courses I took didn't transfer over and I was stuck with more elective credits than anything else.  So I aimed for the fastest degree possible within the general area of IT/Business.  I was assured the degree I chose was ""professional friendly"" and had online or night options.  After a couple semesters, it became clear that the required courses I needed would not be possible for nights/weekends/online, and I'd have to quit my job in order to continue.


I already had $70k in student loan debt and couldn't afford to quit my job so I stopped going to school.  I struggled with depression and realized my mental health played a big role in the majority of my problems.  A couple years later, I lost my job, and while I had no health insurance, I had an accident that resulted in emergency surgery and many thousands in medical bills.  I couldn't afford the loans or the medical bills and filed bankruptcy in December of 2012.


After the freeze period, I tried to figure out the status of my student loans but I was told they had been sold off to another company, who wasn't calling me back.  I played this game for awhile, trying to get ahold of the owner of my debt, and eventually contacted an attorney to ask what I could do before they came after me, despite my efforts to get it all figured out.  He of course said that until they make a move or contact me, there really isn't anything ""actionable"" that I could do.


**Fast forward to this year:**
I have a decent job now and have a handle on my mental health.  Anxiety and depression are no longer uncontrollable forces in my life.


In March 2015 I finally got in contact with the people representing the new creditors of my loans but now they were saying my loans were still with the original lender, Sallie Mae, now known as Navient.  The balance was from 3 different loans and had defaulted and risen to $131,442.42.  The options were a settlement of $65,721.21 or $657.21/month with reduced interest rate of 0.001%.


I told them I could afford $500/month and they agreed.


I have been paying the $500 every month, but when I checked my credit last month, I saw that they are showing the 3 separate loans every month as underpaid with a charge-off on the difference, with all the loans in default.  
 
 
**Situation as of now:**
I called a few times and just heard back today.  I asked if I could get out of default or stop the monthly charge-offs and I was offered a new settlement option of $51,942.  He went on to say ""If you wanted to, I could ask them... POSSIBLY, if they'd be willing to accept $41,554 in a 12 month timeframe.  But I can't guarantee they'd accept it"" and he seemed very interested in getting me to submit a request for it, even if I was almost certain there's no way I could get the money for it.


He waffled a lot on the options, but even if that cheapest option of $41,554, paid within a year, was a real option, It would basically be my entire income after taxes, if not a bit more.


**Is there anything I can do to improve my situation?  Or are the defaulted loans going to continue killing my credit for the next 22 years if I can't pay a settlement?**
 
 
 

**TLDR: I made mistakes and had emergencies that led me to bankruptcy in December 2012.  Now I have $130k in defaulted student loans, and a monthly payment of $500 with 0.001% interest.  The settlement options are beyond my means.**",finance,1442960822

solar,Going solar and can't decide between SMC SB 7000 String Inverter or Emphase M250 Microinverter - which would you choose?,"**Here is the background:**

 * Location: Encinitas, CA

 * Site: Home has plenty of roof space to accommodate 35+ panels 

 * Roof: Concrete Tile

 * Roof sits almost due south @ 192 degrees and aprox 5.6 hours of sunlight

 * There is minimal shading by one palm tree but would mostly not factor unless 28+ panels were needed and another row was installed near the shadow

 * Payment:  Looking to purchase the system outright - no loan



**2 Solar Options Considering**:

 * System Size: 7.8 KW

 * % of offset: 100%

 * Panels: w/ String inverter 22 Sunpower 345W panels, or w/ Microinverter 25 LG NeON™2 315W

 * Total Cost (not including Fed Tax Credit): String inverter 36K, Microinverter 34.6K

 * Costs include replacing the outdated circuit panel



**Why I'm leaning towards Microinverters**:  

 * I would prefer to go with the newer technology especially since I'll most likely have the system for 20 years+.

 * I like the idea of being able to monitor each panels output

 * I like converting DC to AC at the source

 * I like the idea of being able to add additional panels if needed easily (although, full disclosure, our utility has stated changing your output by more than 10% could jeopardize being grandfathered into Net metering).

 * I like the 25 year warranty and that they have a much longer expected life than string inverters

 * I like not being held hostage by the weakest producing panel as with string inverters



**What scares me about Empahse Microinverters**: 

 * No established track record

 * Even though the warranty is 25 years, labor costs to replace faulty microinverters are not included in the warranty
 * Not compatible with the best panels available today (IMHO) Sunpower

 * Could mean more failure points and big replacements costs if many of them start to fail
 

**Why I'm considering SMA SB String Inverter instead**

 * My solar contractor is recommending this option instead of Microinverters (however they will install either)

 * Peace of mind considering their long history and proven track record

 * Many positive reviews

 * Can support Sunpower Panels


**Why I'm not thrilled about String Inverters**

 * Seems like ""old school"" technology that's already outdated in a sector that's continually changing/improving

 * The combination of this inverter with Sun Power panels, Although considered a 'Cadillac' system; due to grounding requirements, the system becomes very specific and non interchangeable.  I could use other panels going forward for example.

 * Not a fan of spending aprox 3K in 15 years to replace the inverter given their relatively short life given the panels lifespan

 * Cannot monitor each panel

 * whole system could produce down to weakest producing panel

 * one major fail point

 * Needing to install large box on side of house

One final note, I'm not considering a halfway product like the Solar Edge inverters.  Simply put, I'm either going all the way with old school with a string inverter implementation or rolling the dice with unproven microinverter.  I feel the hybrid approach (Solar Edge) increases complexity with little additional benefit.

personalfinance,[Debt] What should I do about my Credit Card Debt?,"I am a 20 yr old college student. 

I have two credit cards. One I signed up for on my 18th birthday as a starting out credit card through Capital One. The other is a Chase card I got last year in December. The following table shows my debts per card and interest rates. 



**CARD** | **AMOUNT OWED** | **INTEREST**
---|---|----
CAPITAL ONE | 389.77 | 24.90% APR
CHASE | 1528.00 | 22.24% APR

Other than the credit cards, I have one medical bill that I am currently trying to pay off, and student loans which are about $16000 right now. I make monthly payments that are always above the minimum payment. 

The interest rates on my credit cards are what worries me, because they are so high. I bank through Navy Federal and I had the idea of getting a loan, when I get a job within the next month, which will be used to pay off my credit cards. I thought about doing this because Navy Federal is known for their low interest rates on their loans. I would have a lower interest rate, and I would not have to worry about my credit cards because they will be completely paid off. 

Any thoughts on this idea? 

Do you guys have any other ideas on what I could do to get rid of my credit card debt?

Should I withdraw my IRA to survive the next 2-3 years?,"**tl;dr** No stable job, very small income, and big student loan payments. I am losing $560 a month and my bank account will soon be empty. What would you do?

After 6 years in low-paying jobs I decided to go to college. I thought education was an investment for a better financial future and age didn’t matter when it comes to improving myself. I took out student loans and graduated with a BA in business in May. 

Now I am 29 with $90K in student loans, and (surprise!) no full-time job or a career. I keep applying for marketing/admin/generalist jobs and do temp gigs here and there, but have no prospect for a stable job anytime soon.

After several months I realize this may be my reality for a while longer. With my bank account shrinking rapidly, I want to regroup my finances and set myself up to survive for a 2-3 years with unstable income and loan payments. What I don’t know is how. 

This is what I have:

* Student loans: Federal at 4.5% ($72K, monthly payment $746), privately held at 7.5% rate ($18K, monthly payment $214)
* Cash: Down to $6K in checking account
* IRA from my pre-college life: $23K http://hellomoney.co/portfolio/95d42b-iraprevious-401k
* No other debt. I haven’t used credit card for several months.
* Monthly expenses: I can keep it under $800 for some time. Just moved back with my parents.
* Monthly income: Last month I made about $900 waiting tables, $300 tutoring ESL students. 

Assuming I lose $560 every month, should I consider withdrawing my IRA soon?

personalfinance,22k debt/ 44k base pay/ 23 years old,"Hi, 

I graduated a few months ago and currently have $21,900 in student loans and make $21.50 an hour. I have been paying off just over 2k a month for the last three months. In order to make this happen I live with my gma and commute 30 miles each way to work. I just started contributing 4% to my 401k (what my employer will match) and have $1,500 as an emergency fund. I add about $400/month to this emergency fund. 

After lurking on this subreddit for a while it seems the consensus is to aggressively pay off student loans with interest rates above 4%. Right now the average interest rate of all my loans combined is about 4%. 

I've been reading similar posts and found the information given very helpful but was looking for some more specific advice in terms of my personal goals. My long term goals are to purchase a car and to put a down payment of a house before I'm 30 (hopefully by the time I'm 28). I'm not quite sure its possible to do so without slowing down my repayment rate unfortunately. 

Basically my question is do you believe it would be adventagous to continue to allocate most of my income to paying student loans or to begin saving for house, car, retirement ect.

I graduated with a Chemical &amp; Biological engineering degree and am gaining very relative experiance in my field, however my current position is not engineering. I'm hoping to move into a more engineering role within a year (or two) which would almost certainly increase my salary (hopefully 60-70k). 

My concerns are that my current living situation is not exactly stable (my gma is 92), my monthly income fluctuates wildly (between $2600 and $3300), and my car (93 camry) has been incredibly expensive to keep running lately. Because of this I plan on beefing up my emergency fund quickly and I might have living expenses increase $1000 for rent. 


Summary:
-21k student loan debt
-$1500 emergency fund
-$600-$800 expenses (food, gas,entertainment)(mostly gas and food)
- between $2600 and $3200 a month take home salary
- uncertain living situation 
- Unreliable car (93 camry)
- Currently paying off 2k a month of student loans

Goals - down payment on house / purchase car by the time I'm 30.

Overall question- Should I continue to pay off student loans aggressively or allocate more funds to saving for future goals/ emergency fund? Would it be possible to pay of student loans first and still save enough in time to make these goals happen

personalfinance,Order to pay student loans,"Hey PF,

I only occasionally lurk since I am reasonable with my money.  But now the lady has scored a job, and needs to start paying on her student loans.  My parents had planned for me since I was adopted, so I never had student loans, so I don't really know how best to pay them off. So far I have been solely supporting us after we graduated and we are not currently accruing any debt for living.  I have the 401k set up with work, insurances covered, my auto loan is being paid over the minimum each month, and I am able to put roughly $100 into savings each month.  I would like to put a little more into savings from either income, but I don't know how much we should be trying to put it each month as opposed to paying off her loans.  She makes $1480/month before taxes and claims 1 (i *think* $250 would go to taxes each month then).

Her loans:

* Sallie May 0188 - $12,181 @ 5%

* Sallie May 2649 - $17,728 @ 5%

* Sallie May 4169 - $  7,526 @ 5%

* Sallie May 5616 - $  5,431 @ 5%

* Great Lakes       - $  3,500 @ 3.4% Subsidized

* Great Lakes       - $  4,561 @ 3.4% Subsidized

* Great Lakes       - $  2,530 @ 6.8% Un-subsidized

* Great Lakes       - $  2,390 @ 6.8% Un-subsidized

I imagine that we can pay off the Great Lakes loans individually, as opposed to the lump sum of $12,981.  So am I correct that we should pay the minimums on everything and put the rest on the 6.8% loans first since they have the highest interest rate. After that I don't know whether it would be better to pay off the 3.4% loans since they would get paid off the quickest because the balance is the lowest, or the Sallie May loans, because their interest is the next highest.

personalfinance,Financial Situation Sanity Check Please?,"25 year old single childless male engineer here (Could I be a bigger reddit stereotype?). Could use a little advice on specifically how I'm doing and what I should do. I'm trying to get rid of my student loans. I made 3 major ""mistakes"" in the last year financially: I bought a brand new car with a high payment (I LOVE my car so much though!), I bought a fancy bed because I was sick of my broken IKEA one and getting horrible sleep, and I bought a new iMac that I just paid off. Both the bed and the computer were on 0 interest credit cards, but maybe I should've just paid cash. Credit is nice anyway.

My main concern is getting rid of my student loan debt, which I've been paying extra towards. I'm concerned that my company's 401k is a waste of time (slow vest period for contribution and -11% returns so far this year), and wondering if I should just abandon ship on it and put all that money towards my student loans or my emergency fund or if I'm overreacting. 



**Income:** 


* $95,000 Annually ($59,400 after 401k, health insurance, taxes)


* $4,950/month take home pay


* $500/month roughly pre-tax going to 401k


**Assets:**


* $3,500 in Savings


* $5,000 in Checking


* $3,500 Previous Employer 401k


* $2,500 Current Employer 401k ($5,000 assuming vested)


* Car Valued Roughly $40,000


**Absolute Minimum Bills:**


* Student Loan Minimums: $440/month


* Rent + Utilities: Roughly $900/month


* Car Payment + Insurance: $760/month


* Bed Payment $110/month


* Gym Membership: $40/month + Roughly $200/month for training sessions


* Phone Bill: $50/month

Add gas, food, doctor copays and other stuff and I'm at around $3000 a month in bare minimum living expenses. I could cut a bit there but meh.



In addition right now I'm putting $500 a month towards my savings and I'm paying an extra $400 a month to my student loans. I also recently got rid of a $25 monthly fee for phone payments and a $150 a month payment on a computer (This took $1000 out of my savings though). But that's all the monthly bills I can really get rid of besides the training sessions, which are motivating me to stay in the gym 5 days a week. 

I guess I have a gap of money there but it seems to just go to things ranging from extra medical co-pays (currently getting dental work and sleep studies done) to going to music festivals and anime cons and raves and things of that sort. I try to go out to something social once a week like a Meetup group...and the drinks and parking in town add up too. I'm not sure how much of this I'm willing to cut though, given that I don't want to become a hermit in my house just to get a bit ahead on my finances. 

**Debts:**


* $30,500 Federal Student Loans @ 6.55% (9 years left on minimums, 3 and 1/2 years at going payments)


* $48,500 Car Loan @ 3.25% (79 months left)


* $5,900 Bed Payment @ 0% (54 months left)



Now I have a tricky situation as well with two student loans totally $30,000 or so my parents cosigned that are in their bankruptcy but not ""in"" their bankruptcy according to my parents. They show up on my credit report as ""Closed"" and the companies won't talk to me about them til their bankruptcy is up. I worry about them, they could either demand the whole sum, write them off or put me on payments again when the bankruptcy ends and I'm in wait and see mode on those...not sure what to do about it.


I guess I have a few questions:


1. Should I get stop of my 401k contributions that are losing me money to pay my high interest federal loans?


2. Since these are those super easy on you federal loans, would I be better off putting the extra payments on those towards my lower interest debt or emergency savings?


3. At what point would investing be a good idea? Ideally after I have a 6-month emergency fund I'd like to start growing my wealth but would it be better to get out of the debt first? 


4. Anything I can do about my private cosigned loans I haven't been able to pay on?

personalfinance,Student loan mess - loan servicer applies payment across several loans instead of using avalanche method,"I have a bunch of student loan debt and several questions about it.

I have loans with two different servicers. One of these servicers is doing something that I think is a little sketchy. They are servicing 6 different loans of mine that have different interest rates, charging me one monthly fee, paying off the total interest then distributing the rest across all of the balances, rather than using the amount remaining after interest towards the loan with the highest rate as recommended in the avalanche method.

I think this is costing me a lot of money and they won't change the way they distribute the payments, saying that it's in my agreement.

* Original balance: $24,750
* Current balance: $21,537.33
* Lifetime Amount Paid: $9,851.75
* Total Principal Paid: $4,218.17
* Total Interest Paid: $5,633.58

It seems like I'm going nowhere fast with these. 

I'm wondering if it would make sense to switch to an income-based repayment plan to reduce the amount of money that the loan servicer has control of, then apply the rest of the amount that I would normally to the balance of the highest interest rate loans. In concrete terms, I am currently paying $294/month. If I switched to IBR I could get a rate of $258/month. Then I can make an extra payment of $36 each month towards the balance of the highest interest rate loan in that account. **Does that make sense and would it save me money in the long run?** Has anyone else ran into this and do you know if its possible to get these people to redirect my payments in the optimal manner? Are there any other options that I might not be aware of?

Here are the balances of the loans within this account if it helps:

* Unsubsidized 1: $3,426.28 6.550%
* Unsubsidized 2: $4,028.44 6.550%
* Unsubsidized 3: $4,981.89 6.550%
* Subsidized 1: $2,506.19 5.350%
* Subsidized 2: $1,531.23 4.250%
* Subsidized 3: $5,015.50 6.550%

I earn $57,000/year living in NYC. In addition to these loans I have a $13,094 loan at 5% plus about $7000 of credit card debt. I know I fucked up big time, but I did get a Master's degree from an Ivy League school plus a professional Bachelor of Architecture degree which is a 5 year undergraduate degree, so it's not as bad as it could have been. 

I have spent this year trying to achieve some sense of financial stability. I am an architect and in addition to my full time job I do freelance work, and currently have 2 freelance jobs which pay really well and in cash. I have built up an emergency fund and now have $5000 in savings and have paid off about $2000 of credit card debt, plus I've opened an IRA with my company and am contributing $71.25 twice a month, which is the maximum my employer will match (3% of my annual salary). My plan is to get my credit card balance down to zero by the end of this year then start attacking these student loans.

My problem is that I could only get short-term fiduciary/personal loan for it (instead of housing loan) - although the interest rate is low, it has to be re-payed fully in 7 years, and the monthly repayment will be around 25% of my salary, which is almost half of my capacity of spending:

- 30%: supporting my parent
- 15%: current rent &amp; utility
- 15%: basic life cost: food etc

Other similar loan high interest rate total owed ~2700 (300 a month payments **Has a 2000** Payoff amount 

2 other loans  amounting to about  500 a month

I have a budget setup and follow it very closely, but these monthly debts are making my now decent salary ~65k a year not even make it paycheck to paycheck.

I am reducing any spending in places I have control but I am asking if there is a type of consolidation loan that I may qualify for that can take some strain and stress of of me? I have a credit score  of about ~620

I was just approved for a capital one quicksilverone card for a limit of 1000 which has an apr of 0% until next June, but I do not want to carry a balance off this card as I am working towards a better future and will only charge what I can afford to pay off by the due date and maintain a utilization of about 30%

To make matters worse I am fighting with a few collections companies over medical bills my insurance did not pay and only recently discovered due to a wakeup call when I recieved my annual credit report.  I have had a few of them dismissed due to being invalid but I know I will have to pay on a few of them and am working on settling. I know settling collections accounts doesn't really help credit but I need to do so for a security clearance.


Sorry for the wall of text, I will try to better it tomorrow. If you need any additional information please let me know. I will also work on getting a more exact amount of amount owed and the payoff amount if that will help.

And why can't interest rates just stay low forever?,"Not sure if this counts as one of those moronic questions but this boggles my mind just a little bit....I am in the middle of a Finance class in my school and I'm trying to sort out all this information I just learned about how the Federal Reserve controls the money supply. 

Anyhow....to make it short: When interest rates rise then inflation is suppose to decrease (because less money is circulating)....so if interest rates are kept low then more people have money, more people are buying, and thus inflation increases.

However...inflation is really low right now. 0.2% last I checked and interest rates are near zero. How come inflation isn't increasing?

Is it because people simply don't have money to spend or don't want to spend? Or is it something else I am totally missing? Or is the question/answer not so black and white.",finance,1443085202

personalfinance,(USA) Moving abroad and avoiding public student loans,"Before I write the following post please note that this is purely hypothetical. I have also read any other threads related to this subject already. Anyway, here goes:

I'm currently a junior in college at a private university in Northern California with approximately ~$30,000 in debt thus far. I anticipate I'll probably graduate with roughly $50,000 in public student loan debt when I get my degree in December 2016. I'm an International Studies Major (Middle Eastern Studies, to be precise) and a freelance journalist by trade. Given what I want to do for a living--work as a [stringer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stringer_(journalism) covering conflicts in the Middle East and Africa--I'm very well-aware of the fact that I will likely make a very modest living (to say the least) when I graduate. I didn't get into this business for the money afterall. While I fully intend to pay off my student loans, all of which are public/federal (i.e. government) loans, I'm curious what the consequences would be if I moved abroad and simply refused to pay back the debt? 

I've already done a lot of reading on this so what I'm really wondering is whether or not the federal government (or whatever creditor I owe the loans to) would be able to sue me in court in a foreign country and how likely this is? This is all assuming I decided to never move back to the US and become a permanent resident (and perhaps eventually a citizen) of another country.

For the sake of clarity, I fully intend to pay off my student loans in full.

Only 500,000 of those diesels have made it to the U.S. So the product liability is likely to be much worse.

Daycare kills me, gasoline doesn't help. Public transportation is an option, the vehicle with a payment gets 40+mpg. Last year my fiancee totalled a car that we had literally just purchased. I just realized today that the finance company (it was a .9% loan) decided to ding us for a 90+ and a 60+ day late payment because their own stupid asses took so long to pay out their gap coverage. I have initiated the dispute process. My credit score a year ago was about 805, today it's just short of 700. I am sad.

This is mostly a question about those stupid credit cards.

I went shopping for loan rates and got 7.99%. Originally I was going to roll the laywer into there, but duh, he's 0% interest so he can rot. :) Moving all the cards into one loan gives me a payment just short of $240 but gets rid of them all in 3 years. The thing is that I don't have enough room in my budget for that extra $80. It's just not there. I have been really, really trying to put more attention on my retirement accounts which are effectively tiny, I think sum total like $7k, way too low for a 35 year old. If I basically kill my contributions there, I can cover the $80, thinking I can still toss whatever is left in there at the end of the month.

So anyway, after all that, I see about 4 options:

1. I can drop all the balances onto one card that has a 13% rate. No extra fees, no new lines of credit, and just try to pay MORE on them each month. Individual interest rate means more of what I'm paying goes to balance. I can do this immediately.
2. I do the consolidation loan, dropping contributions to retirement but I'm free and clear in 3 years. At tax time I put the tax return in savings, which are basically zero right now.
3. I wait until after the new year, do my taxes, take the entirety of the return and apply it towards a card or two, then apply for a smaller loan.
4. I get the consolidation now, and then smash it with the tax return money when it comes in.

I'm 100% open to suggestions. I should expect a small raise this year and I should also expect my income to grow in the future much faster than it has in the past.",finance,1443108737

It happened for a reason. We believe that the situation with Gazprom requires a separate conversation that cannot fit into a couple of paragraphs. Firstly, because Gazprom and what is happening in this company has a very special significance for our country as a whole. 

Secondly, because of problems of Gazprom we know not by hearsay-in their professional activities we have for them is the most direct and immediate relevance, as a former fuel and Energy Minister and Deputy Minister of energy of Russia. 

Thirdly, because Gazprom has become a kind of special, personal project, Vladimir Putin, is from the outset of his presidency, he carefully took the company appointed to key posts in her close people, delved into details of her case. Gazprom is one of the few projects that Putin could be considered personally responsible almost from the outset of his reign, and that you can really judge the outcome of Putin.

At some point that stopped and she didn't know, and one or both went into default.  She was able to negotiate one into a debt consolidation, but not the other.  Starting in October she is going to have 25% of her wages garnished.


Numbers for her:

The defaulted loan is $25K

The non-defaulted loan is $15K

We calculated 25% of her wages to be ~$1000 / month

The other loan payment is ~$250 / month

She just bought a car on a $10K loan; payments about $250 / month

She pays about ~$500/month for half of a mortgage with her retired mom paying the other half (otherwise she mostly supports her mother, aunt, brother and his kids because she is only one with reliable employment)

She donates 10% of her net income to her church (insists that is nonnegotiable)

Has a second part time job working for herself as a fitness instructor but class attendance fell off and it isn't making as much money; it was formerly responsible for any extra income so now she is sitting at break even every month (before the 25%!)


Right now she's trying to deal with it all her own and won't accept my help.  However she also believes this has torpedoed our chances of starting a family together after we're married.

(Her mother believes that since I was previously married and divorced, any marriage to her daughter is invalid and living in sin and becomes physically sick at the sight of me.)

I have a number of questions.  First, 25% seems draconian - how can they do that?  Just how bad is the situation after we have combined income?  Will the defaulted loan be paid off in 2 years under this plan, or do they tack on some kind of extra fees + interest while they're doing this?  If we get married, does it become 25% of our combined income, or still just hers?  (If it is not combined, what happens if she stops working to have kids?)  What can she/we do in the meantime before we're married?  And after?  Bearing in mind she still insists it's her problem to take care of herself and not involve me - could also use help convincing her she needs to accept my help.

I'm perfectly okay with moving to a country with a lower cost of living, scaling back my spending, or (God forbid) going back to work if things don't work out.  I just want to get out there before I'm too old to enjoy anything.  And I'm divorced and my children are almost grown, so I don't have many obligations.

My ""number"" is somewhere between $550K-$750K, depending on interest rates and such.  I'm about 2-5 years away.  I plan to work half time for a year or two before fully retiring, as a dry run.

The vast majority of my assets are in my 401(k).  (I'll roll it into an IRA when I retire.)  I just found out what an awesome savings vehicle an HSA is, so I'm going to start saving in that too.  I don't really do a Roth IRA, because my tax bracket is pretty high right now.

I am almost 100% invested in stocks.  Assuming a 10.5% return and a 3% inflation, I can withdraw 7.5% of my assets per year and never outlive my money, right?  Right?!?!!  In reality, I plan to withdraw around 5-6% per year to give myself a cushion, and also dynamically adjust my withdrawal rate to reflect market conditions.  I'll keep a 1-2 year cushion some place safe to ride out really bad markets.  I've run the spaghetti models, and they predict a 60-80% of success, exactly as I want it.

In order to access my money, I plan to take a 72(t) distribution from my 401(k).  For this to work, I need to wait until the Fed interest rates rise to at least 4-4.5%.  Assuming I have $650K and 120% of the Federal Mid-Term rate is 4.5%, that will give me around $35K / year to spend.  I plan to move to a low cost country such as Costa Rica, Vietnam, or Malta, so that should be plenty.  Whatever room I have left per year in the 25% tax bracket, I plan to convert from the Rollover IRA into a Roth IRA, so I can do the Roth Conversion Ladder.  Whenever the earlier of (my Roth Conversion Ladder is big enough or the stock market tanks), I will switch my 72(t) to the Required Minimum Distribution method, which is only $16K/year.

So tell me - what am I missing?  Is this going to work, or am I an idiot?


Edit: people are hung up on my 10.5% return. I'm not actually expecting a 10.5% return. That's just the long term historical average.

I've only read a few articles about cash value life insurance, so I'm not an expert, but it sounds like there are quite a few advantages and is very different from term life insurance and other traditional policies. Some of the advantages it seems to offer is that 
  
  
* 1) we can borrow loans from the policy that are not subject to federal income tax - I am a little confused on what repayment would mean though

That said, one of my friends seems to think that Fanduel winnings will be taxed in California as ""Prize Tax"". Is that true? If so, should I expect a 50% cut of my Fanduel Net Profit to go to taxes?

Facts that may help someone determine this:
•I end the year with $40,000 Net profit on Fanduel.
•I make $50,000 per year (Gross Income) in a full-time job.
•I'm single.
•I live in California.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on getting a home equity loan turned into a mortgage.,"I'm trying to help out my ex-wife and, by extension, myself.  We've been separated for a number of years and officially divorced for 11 months.  Everything that needed to be done as part of our divorce is done except for refinancing the house her and her mother live in.  At present, it is a home equity loan in my name and my ex-wife's name.  She needs to refinance it in her name and her mother's name so that its no longer affecting my creditworthiness for things plus neither I nor her want my name on it any longer.  Additionally, she wants it to be a mortgage instead of a home equity loan so the taxes and insurance can get put in escrow and she'll end up with a much better interest rate.  Well, initially, she was unable to refinance it because her mother's credit score was too low as most lenders want a 620 or higher credit score.  Her mother (with her help) has been working to improve her credit score for about a year.  It finally got above 620.  So she goes to apply and gets some unpleasant news.  My ex-wife's score is now below 620 because she went back to school for her masters' and has been using her credit card to pay some of her tuition (a small portion).  She's up on her payments and has always been, but her credit score has fallen because she has been using a much higher percentage of her available credit due to using her card to pay a portion of her tuition (85-90% instead of the usual 50%).  So now she's stuck trying to figure out what to do.  Her credit union and bank have both said they can't help until she gets her credit score back up.  There's a mortgage broker she knows that said he can't help until she's 620 or higher.  I looked online at a couple lenders I know of from commercials (Quicken Loans, for example).  Many of these online lenders say they can help people with a credit score of 580 or higher.  I thought that was great...She's 596 right now.  So she called Quicken Loans and they told her they can't help until she has a credit score of 620 or better.  This blatantly contradicts their website, and when she asked about this, they told her that with the way lenders like themselves being regulated these days, its just the rules that the need to follow.  Well, if that is true, they need to update their website.  But that's a pretty vague answer and pressing for more details didn't reveal anything more informing.  We're led to believe things changed and the website hasn't yet been updated to reflect this, which seems very odd for an online lender.  But that's not the point of this discussion.  So after this long explanation, let me try to give as concise of a tl;dr version I can.

Does anyone have advice on how 2 people (credit scores 596 and 628) can get a home equity loan refinanced into a mortgage of about $100,000 on a home valued at over $200,000 that has no other liens besides the home equity loan?",finance,1443121769

A lot of people are spending a lot of time trying to get governments (local, state and federal) to raise the minimum wage, but it occurs to me there could be a free-market solution that works for both business owners and workers without the government needing to get involved.

Basically, Living Wage advocates should create a ""LW"" certification that businesses could apply for.  If they meet the level of that certification (wages, benefits, working conditions), then they could display a ""LW"" logo at their business and in their advertising.   Then customers could choose businesses that are LW certified if they care.  Job seekers could seek jobs at these companies.

I believe that the Equifax score is higher because it takes into account my history as an authorized user on a parent's card.

personalfinance,Best way to pay for a remodel?,"I'm looking at remodeling my kitchen and bathroom in the coming months and after building up my emergency fund (~9 month cushion) I feel more comfortable with getting started. I am thinking it will be around $8k-$10k. I've saved up about $2k so far and I'm putting away another $600 each month. The thing is, I'd like do it within the next 6 months so I can at least get a few years of enjoyment out of it before I sell the place (thinking a 4-5 year timeline before I sell).

Obviously where it stands I don't have the cash to pay for the remodel completely. But I have a couple of options and I'm trying to decide which one is the best decision.

1.) Dip into investments (NOT retirements). The account is sitting at about $18k right now. I'm hesitant to touch this since I lost a few thousand in the market recently and would like to see it recover - I'd also like to keep most of it to possibly help pay for my Master's and as sort of an extra safety net.

2.) Apply for a HELOC. I have about $50k in equity in the home right now (more than 20% of the value). Interest rates are low, but I'm not a big fan of borrowing more money.

3.) Cut down my retirement savings a bit and save up more cash (right now I'm putting 30% of my gross income in retirement - trying to make up for years of minimum wage jobs and no savings. I'm 29 with about 30k saved so far).

Bitcoin,NMTA: De-risking of Bitcoin biz should be made an anti-trust issue,"From today's NMTA Daily News Clippings (sent to subscribers, and will be available on website tomorrow):

Dear Readers,

Our Top Story today tells us that virtual currency startups are leaving Australia due to lack of bank accounts.  

Many people over the years have told me the banks are closing (or reject) our accounts because they want to 'steal' our customers, and so, this should be made an anti-trust issue.

I have always steadfastly maintained that nothing could be further from the truth. Banks are not closing our accounts for competitive reasons. They are doing so because of regulatory pressure. They say so, and we take them at their word.

It is also kind of obvious.

But, nevertheless, our second Top Story, shows that B of A has filed for a patent on how to use Bitcoin to send remittances, even while denying accounts to Bitcoin and remittance companies, their potential competitors. And many other banks are doing the same.

So, no, it is not that competition is motivating the problem, but the impact has anti-competitive consequences, nevertheless.

Bad for business, bad for innovation, bad for the consumer.

I say again: it is not the fault of the banks, it is not the fault of government, yet it is a problem that must be solved, and only government can solve it.

If you are looking for the true core of the banking problem and a clue to the solution, consider this statement, also taken from our Top Story today:

""Blanket classification of all bitcoin businesses and users as 'high risk' customers is both inappropriate and disproportionate....Banking institutions should have a risk-based approach that is 'tailored to the nature, size and complexity of their business and proportionate to the level of money laundering and terrorism financing risk.""

This obvious statement is the best idea we have heard from government to date. If this were the most aggressive treatment you were getting prescribed for a serious medical condition, you would change doctors.

It sounds reasonable but does not go far enough. It gives banks no reassurance and leaves them with no practicable procedure. It implies the naive hope that banks will altruistically start looking at customers individually, instead of categorically, in response to this weak reprimand. To wit, here is a recent Q &amp; A taken from IBAT's (the Independent Bankers Association of Texas) website:

    Deposit Accounts, Money Service Business: Can We Refuse to Open These and Close Those We Have?

    ""Question: A new accounts person opened up an account for a check casher.  Our board is worried about the responsibilities with monitoring/due diligence and has decided NOT to have MSB accounts.  Can we close this account?

    Answer

    Answer: Yes. Outside of the Americans with Disabilities Act, there is no law requiring the bank to provide accounts to whoever requests one (unlike the Fair Lending laws, which prohibit discrimination).  Since the rules regarding amending accounts require 30 days notice, I prefer 30 days notice to the terminated customer.  Also, it may be difficult for this business to find another alternative.
 
Please note that the federal banking regulators have urged banks to not overreact to their guidance on MSB accounts and just refuse to handle these customers.  However, they didn't rescind their earlier [April 26, 2005] guidance.""

So AUSTRAC's (and FATF's) mild guidance and reprimand, ignore and leave completely unaddressed the simple fact that there will always be legal - even regulated - businesses that deserve bank accounts when and where they are needed, yet are considered high-risk and so will be beyond the ability of most banks to vet.

This is not necessarily a bad thing; it's just the way it is, and will not change. But business and innovation come to a halt, consumers are left worse off and find other ways, and law enforcement loses visibility into the financial system, transparency they otherwise would have retained.

Meanwhile, in our United Kingdom section, we read their government is ""...seeking evidence of the impact on business of the current anti-money laundering and terrorist finance regime, and specifically the role of supervisors in that regime. [First published on June 23, 2015; the call for evidence for this review will run until Oct 23, 2015, so get your comments in now.]

I believe our best path is to take further steps to allow government to routinely monitor whatever it is the banks are currently responsible for monitoring. I suggest we register these accounts, get business moving and keep non-bank channels transparent.

And now, please enjoy today's Clippings!

Regards,

-David

PNC has a lot of physical locations in my region, and while it's not completely necessary, it is nice to have for that rare occasion where it's easier to stop by a branch.

I saved roughly $8000 in interest fees.,"4 years of being out of school and today I had a bit of extra money in my bank account, so I made a lump sum payment and paid off the remaining balance of my loan.  It feels really good.

I used a loan calculator to determine the cost of borrowing for my original 10 year repayment term vs the 4 year term that I ended up with.  There's a difference of about $8000.  That's $8000 that I would have handed over to the bank over the next 6 years had I just made the minimum payments on my loan.

It's something to think about for those of you with loans.  One dollar spent now is one dollar with interest compounded over the remaining life of your loan that you don't have to give away to the bank.  With that thought in the back of my mind, I've been making the decision to delay gratification and pay off my loans with my extra spending money every paycheque. 

I would recommend to people with loans to put a small amount of extra money into your loan every time you get paid.  It doesn't have to be much, maybe only $20-50 if you can afford it, but it does wonders to decreasing the term length of your loan, which in turn saves you a lot of money in the end.

Edit: quick note because a lot of people are asking, but my interest rate on the loan was 6.5%. I also have an employer-matched pension that I pay into every month. I think I'd be hard pressed to find an investment with better than a 6.5% guaranteed return.

I created a throwaway account for this post. My wife and I plan on buying a sailboat in a year or two for around $120,000, with plans to quit our jobs and sail away a couple years later. Right now we've got that money plus some invested in stocks, but I'm worried that a coming bear market would mean I'd be selling those stocks in a year or two at a loss. My worry is that The Fed will soon raise the federal funds rate, which will cause bond yields to increase, which will cause bond values to decrease. Stock dividend yields will then increase as investors compare them the bond yields, which will cause values of dividend-paying stocks to decrease. Values of non-dividend paying stocks will then decrease to match valuations of dividend-paying stocks. So, neither stocks nor bonds look good to me going forward. For our ""sail away"" fund, I'm willing to ride out any coming bear market, but our ""sailboat purchase"" fund has a shorter time frame. As a result, I'm trying to find the best place to park my ""sailboat purchase"" fund for a year or two, until we're ready to buy a sailboat, where I can earn a decent rate of return with little risk of loss. Any ideas? The best I've found so far are a handful of online savings accounts with 1% to 1.1% APY. Is that the best I can hope for? 

I've considered Certificates of Deposits with a 1-year term, but the extra 0.20% or so I'd get don't seem worth the opportunity cost of selling a large chunk of stocks right now to make a large upfront deposit. I'd rather deposit smaller monthly installments over time.",finance,1443196327
personalfinance,"I just got approved for a $150,739 refinancing loan from Ernest. Question: fixed or variable!?","*Read below for my previous post.*


So I have just been approved for a $150,739 loan to refinance my federal and private student loans. If I elect to pay $1,700 a month, I will have the option of paying at **5.88% FIXED or 3.85% VAR.** 


I expect to pay it off in 10 years or less at the fixed rate (or 9 years at current variable rate). What should I do?

*From Earnest website:*

&gt;A variable interest rate will change over time based on an interest rate benchmark known as 1-Month LIBOR. While a variable interest rate may start out low, it can fluctuate over the life of the loan. This means that your monthly payment can also change as interest rates change. You can view historical 1-month LIBOR rates here.

&gt;Interest rates on variable rate loans are capped at 8.95%, 9.95%, or 11.95% depending on term of loan and subject to state availability.



**PREVIOUS POST**


Fellow Redditors,

Long-time lurker here. I want to open up by saying that the help that I got from this subreddit (and r/frugal), needless to say, tremendously changed my financial outlook.


I will cut to the chase and ask you the question that I know some of you can answer with absolute expertise: **what is the best way to get a personal loan to cover a high-interest student loan? (if I should at all?).**


I pay about $1,700 a month for my student loans (graduated payment plan that is not interest-only). I am using avalanche method, but there is one account that I really need to eliminate to save money on interests: a $23,600 account with at 13%, **yes THIRTEEN percent!**


For your reference, the only major purchase that I had was a car from last year that I am on a payment plan for.


The following is my financial portfolio:


**Credit Score**
  
- TransUnion:752

- Equifax:756


**Cash Accounts**

- Bank of America: $1,500

- Chase: $1,500


**Investments**

- 401K at maximum company match of 6%

**Loans Accounts** 

*Credit Cards* (I carry zero balance and each card has 10k+ credit line)

- American Express Blue Preferred
- Bank of America Cash Rewards
- Chase Freedom
- Chase Sapphire 


*Car*

- $25,000 at 1.99%


*Federal Loans* (using avalanche method, graduated payment)

- Perkins: $6,400 at 5.00%
- Stafford A: $2,600 at 6.55%
- Stafford B: $4,500 at 6.55%
- Stafford C: $5,400 at 5.75%
- Stafford D: $5,400 at 5.35%
- Stafford E: $4,500 at 4.25%
- Stafford F: $2,500 at 6.55%
- Stafford G: $2,300 at 6.55%
- Stafford H: $8,100 at 6.55%   


*Private Loans*

- Private A: $27,900 at 5.25%
- Private B: $41,400 at 7.75%
- Private C: $23,600 at 13.00% (crazy right? this was 2009)
- Private D: $19,700 at 9,75% 


After 401K and taxes, I have about $3,500 that come into my account. I have a fixed expense of $3,000 (rent, loans, bills) every month and I also supplement my income with a side job that brings in anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 per month (which I mostly save).


Please let me know if you need more information and I look forward to getting some amazing advice from you guys! Thank you!



**UPDATE:** 

Thank you everyone for taking time to comment and torment. Here's what I have so far:

personalfinance,"Paying off mortgage vs low-yield investments (or, my case against liquidity)","So, I realize that my case may be unique because:

a) I put down a low percentage down-payment on my house

b) I'm paying PMI until 80% LTV

but I think the illustration I came up with may be helpful to others making a decision similar to mine.

This year, I had high medical expenses. This allows me to empty out my Roth (~$5K - yes, I'm young and poor) penalty- and tax- free. I'm managing my medical expenses, so I'm just going to apply the contents of my Roth to my mortgage. I'm very cognisant of the fact that reducing principal early in the mortgage has a much greater effect on total payments over the life of the loan.

I'm also planning on adding an additional $100 towards principal every month from next month on, and applying $1200 biannually from paychecks 13 and 26 (I budget based on two paychecks and get paid three times a month twice a year).

I bounced the idea off of a friend and they suggested I weigh the returns against low-yield bonds and moderate-return stocks. My immediate reaction was that a guaranteed effective monthly return at the rate of my mortgage is better than the stock market, which has earned me exactly nothing in the last 2-3 years, and is likely to continue falling in the short term. Also, the effect of PMI falling off is included in my calculations and very high priority at this juncture. Nonetheless, I threw some low-interest benchmarks into consideration, along with a ""stock"" earning the same rate of return as my mortgage interest rate, with the same contribution levels that would be constituted by my extra payments towards my mortgage principal.

Anyways, with great job security, an employer that would happily float me an interest-free loan in the event of an emergency, and $15000 of my $16000 in available credit unused, I don't really feel the need to aggressively build emergency savings. 

[Here's my pretty chart](http://imgur.com/Y7hOxeD) demonstrating how my extra payments would accrue interest as a simple investment, and how that compares to the effect of interest, and thereby principal, reduction. The difference is really amazing, since I'm treating ""mortgage payment"" as a recurring sunk cost, but out of that an increasing amount is directly applied to the loan principal each month.

I don't have tangible plans to sell the house in the immediate future, but I don't plan to stay here much longer than 5 years, so I think this chart nicely demonstrates how easy it is to build wealth through ""investing"" in my mortgage. I have seen that the members of this sub typically discourage this type of behavior, so go ahead, try to dissuade me.

personalfinance,"If you have a sec, could you review my plan for paying for PA school","Happy Friday all!

After a long and arduous interview cycle, I got an acceptance letter this March to an accelerated 24 month physician assistant program.  I currently work in psychiatric admissions making mid 50's per year.  Its not work that I want to keep doing.  I and many others are fairly miserable with how dysfunctionally the place is being run and I might be making excellent timing on leaving as there is a significant chance that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Studies might be decertifying us in the next year.  I'm probably the only one in my department not having regular panic attacks as I already have my transition planning and guaranteed.  

Today I finally got my aware letter from the Dept of Ed explaining how much I would be getting in federal direct unsubsidized loans.  I have been waiting for this letter for months, just so I could know how much extra I needed to come up with for paying for my graduate level physician assistant program.

The good news is that I have been saving hardcore for the past several years to cache away as much money as possible for this transition, given that PA school is a 90 hour a week commitment and I will have to be giving up my full time job to make this work.  Accounting for additional wages for the next three months and roughly 320 hours of vacation time that I am selling back to my hospital when I depart, I should have in excess of $47,000 in my savings and checking accounts.  I even made my last day of employment in 2016, just so my vacation cashout lands on fiscal year 2016 and I can avoid paying state and federal income taxes on that money (as I wont have any other income that year and will have lots of education deductions).  The great news is that through my hard work and financial planning, I have enough cash on hand to live off of for two years of not having a job.  

My current living expenses (rent, extra gasoline, groceries, electric, auto ins, cable, internet) comes to $930 per month.  I owe just under $38,000 in undergraduate student loans, amounting to roughly $480 per month in payments ($325 to sallie mae and $155 for existing federal direct loans).  I am confident that I could get these deferred if I need to keep my expenses down, but if not, it shouldnt be a fiscal burden.  This comes to a total of $22,320 for the two years and $24,180 if we add on the extra 60 days after graduation of waiting on licensing and commencing employment (the program has 100% employment rate within 60 days).  

My award is $6,833 per semester or $13,666 in federal direct unsubsidized student loans for 2016 and I anticipate that it will be at least $20,499 for 2017 as the financial aid department of the program advised me that their year round program qualifies for an extra semester in the second year during clinical rotations.  

My plan, *and here is where I am actively looking for critiques*, to keep as much cash on hand as possible during the first year.  My wife and I are moving 90 minutes away and she may need assistance with extra capital as she is transitioning between jobs.  She does not have one lined up in the new area yet.  I was planning on taking out the remaining $19,033 in expenses the first year on private student loans.  The second year, when I have more money coming in through federal direct loans, my difference that I need to come up with is $12,200.   If all goes well, I should still have $22,820 on hand at this point, and could just write them a check for the remaining $12,200 out of pocket, completely sidestepping private loans for year two.  This should leave me with $10,620 on hand and graduating with a career starting at $96,000 per year (the schools median starting salary for last years graduates).  I figure that with the extra money I could either save it for a down payment on a house, which my wife and I would be looking to get within a year of graduation, or could just write a check to pay down a lot of my first years loan.  I am hesitant to give up too much of my cash on hand the first year out of fear that my car may need repairs or my wife may be laid off (she has an associates in accounting now and has been doing alright for herself, but I've had to support her twice so far in our relationship due to layoffs).  

I know that financial assistance exists through the Health Service Corps.  Basically 10% of applicants get their education paid for by them in exchange for signing a contract for 2-3 years of your life belonging to the federal government, where they can deploy you wherever and whenever they need you.  I am not interested in serving a year at one clinic, then being uprooted and spending another year at a different placement across the country.  I am however, interested in pursuing their options to work in an underserved community in primary care upon graduating, whereby I pick from their list of locations and they write off up to $30,000 per year in student loan debt.  I have already looked and there is quite the plethora of approved locations in the rural NH area, where my wife and I ultimately want to live.  

So anyways, here is my plan.  I'd love to hear some feedback if any of you have time as this community seems to be extremely insightful when it comes to financial planning.

personalfinance,Should I refinance some of my student loans with Sofi?,"I have roughly $100,000 in student loans. $70,000 is in the form of Direct Parent Plus loans in my parents name with an interest rate of 7.9%! The remaining $30,000 is a mixture of subsidized/unsubsidized Stafford loans in my name with interest rates ranging from 3.4% to 6.8%.

I'm thinking of refinancing the $70,000 with Sofi so I can get a lower interest rate and get them out of my parents name. I was offered a fixed interest rate of 5.99% with Sofi. I understand that if I were to refinance I would lose some of the flexibility associated with federal loans (IBR,deferment,forbearance). My thinking is I will still have $30,000 in federal so if things get tough I could put that amount on hold and focus only on making the private (Sofi) payments. Obviously I plan on being able to make the payments but you never know.

I'm a mid-20s, working individual from a poor background with a non-financially savvy family. I purchased my first car in May 2014, at a high interest rate because I knew I had no credit background and there were a lot of factors involved. Here is the weird part. 

I always had plans to refinance once I got settled. I've been tracking my credit score,  it's been 740-770 for months,  and I have three credit cards with great rewards that I pay off prior to each statement. So after about a year, I tried to refinance with my bank and was told no,  I called for more information and was told nothing,  at all. So I tried with a credit union and was approved for 2 . something % (from my current 10.84, ouch). Everything looked great,  but...

I don't have a drivers license. The car is purchased fully in my name, but my boyfriend drives it. I've never had a license, several permits and I've drived a bit but I put it off so long,  driving makes me nervous. I'm anxious just writing this. I explained to the credit union, and I've found documents online saying there are sometimes exceptions for cases like mine,  but the credit union told me nowhere else would accept me either and that it's mandatory to have a valid license to refinance.

I know the best solution is just to get the license, and I've talked myself up to doing it several times,  set deadlines,  etc, but I just can't get there.

personalfinance,Money Trapped in 403(b),"I recently went to roll-over money I had in a 403b from a previous employer and learned that the matching funds from the employer could not be rolled over.

The retirement fund is a managed fund where I have no control over the allocations and they set just set quarterly interest for everyone based on overall performance. At retirement you are basically forced to purchase an annuity from the fund. It's the YMCA retirement fund to be specific, if that helps in any way. 

Apparently, they have a rule that you can roll over all of the accounts, including the legacy matching account, except for the current employer match account if the balance is above $5000.

I have roughly $5116 in that account. I am fully vested, and I haven't been employed by the Y in roughly 5 years. I received no notification that I was approaching a point of no return on rolling over my account. I really didn't start getting my financial house in order until last January, but had I been informed I'd no longer be able to move it, I would have rolled it over.

Unfortunately, since the account just accrues interest every quarter based on their stated interest rate, I can't reallocate or rely on the fund to drop on its own (I don't think they have ever gone negative on interest, lowest I've seen is 1%). 

Does anyone have any ideas how I can get my money out? 

I can't find any options for fund services that have a fee. I just think its absurd that my money is being held hostage over $116.

Oh, and I only get annual statements, so even though I was below the limit last year, I didn't find out until halfway through this year that I went over. I can leave the money in there until I'm 55 and then take it as a disbursement, or purchase a lifetime annuity, but even if I got 6% for the remaining 27 years, I would only be getting like $200 a month.",finance,1443207638

I've been subscribed for a little while but this is my first post. I searched the post history as well as scanned through the FAQ but couldn't find what I was looking for, so I apologize if this has been answered already and I missed it.

So here's my story: my fiance and I need some help paying for our upcoming wedding, and I would like to take a specific training/certification to advance my career (current employer will not pay for this and I would be entering a different field for it anyhow so I will need to pay for it myself). We will need several thousand dollars more than budgeted in our savings for the wedding, and the training is about $4k. I currently already have roughly $60k in student loan debt from my schooling (earned my bachelor's degree a few years ago), a VISA with a limit of $2,200, and a couple of retailer-specific credit cards that do not help in this scenario. I earn about $50k/year and live in an expensive area. My short term plans are to get this certification which will almost guarantee an immediate and significant raise in income and job stability, then have the wedding next year, and then take the necessary time to pay down any additional debt we incur. The things that cannot change are the timeline of the training and the wedding. I have enough income now to make payments on an additional loan of some type, but not enough to raise significant capital via savings alone in the timeframe needed. I am considering a personal loan, such as what Lending Club offers, to help pay for the wedding and the training. Lending Club has offered a very high interest rate (19-20+%) and it is really the only option I have checked (my bank doesn't do personal loans and I am not very experienced with lending in general).

My questions are: is this a good option? Are there options I haven't considered? Is there some kind of student loan that would apply to job training that I would qualify for and would be better than a personal loan? Do you have advice for finding the best loan, or if there is a better option how do I go about getting the best rate, etc.

* 5% pre-tax income into Roth, matched by employer (max match)
* $7,000 in 401(k)
* $22,500 in savings account. Credit union account with 0.29% interest rate
* $5,500 in Vanguard 2055 Retirement Roth (just started contributing at end of last year)

I feel like I have followed a lot of advice on this sub in the past year to get a better hold on my finances. I started budgeting, maxed my employer match, started Roth contributions, and am now saving 40% of my take home every month on top of 401(k) and Roth contributions. Feels good, but I also still feel pretty new to all of this.

I do hate my job though, and will be quitting at the end of the year. By that time I should have approximately:

* $8,500 in 401(k)
* $7,500 in Roth 
* $30,000 in savings (severance bonus after cashing out vacation/sick will net me $3,700)
* $13,000 in student loan debt

My plan is to travel internationally during the winter and return to the states in spring to find a new job and place to live in a quieter and cheaper part of the country. I have $10,000 budgeted for travel, storage, moving, and emergency fund while I find a new job which should get me into June 2016. I have a large cash savings with the anticipation that I will be doing the aforementioned travelling and also saving longer term for grad school in the future. 

Does anything seem wrong with what I am doing? I plan on maintaining that path for 3 more months until quitting and travelling. Is there anything I can do better during this time frame, while travelling, or once I find a new job next year, assuming my overall savings rate of 40% can be maintained? 

Some ideas I have had are:

* Move most of my savings into an online savings account with 1% interest
* Add more to my 401(k), might be more hassle than is worth it for 2-3 months
* Pay off the student loans fast, even though my mom can only pay me back at the rate I am currently paying them off

dogecoin,Bter.com experiences,"Hey guys,

Since a couple of days I use Bter.com to trade Doge and try to make a profit by trading Doge for CNY and back again (which works pretty well), but my mate told me Bter.com was a scam site. 
So I googled... And I saw people claiming the same thing. Bter, ""scamed"" people out of 1,7 million dollars of BTC and kinda Mt. Gox-ed it...

But whats nice about Bter.com is that they also deal in a lot of altcoins like Fedoracoin and Reddcoin... Coins I also used to invest in, and have a nice amount of...

For me Bter.com was heaven send. Tho Doge is my favorite, as it introduced me to crypto currency... I have a heart for the entire scene, you know. I like many crypto's. So I thought it was awesome that this exchange has so many options in altcoins.

But now I worry... The seed of doubt is planted in my brain. And I thought, you guys might be on Btercom aswel, and might be able to soothe my mind or tell me to get out of there.

Does any of you shibes trade at Bter? Or know that it's a scam?

Where do you draw the line between general savings and debt repayment? To minimize interest payments, I would have to put 100% of my unused money into my student loans. The way I see it, every dollar not spent on the loans carries a premium equal to the annual interest rate time times the number of years it takes me to pay it off.

To begin with, that dork muslim admitted the clock looked suspicious.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQHZ0kAInxY 

But the left said ""NO! ITZ DUH RACISM! MY FEELZ.....THATS WHY!""

Wow...He wore a NASA shirt. How scientific of him.  Let us all shed a tear and embrace, while talking really loud in public about how great muslims and minorities are, hoping to ""science"" a minority can overhear us speak! That way they will know.....We are super trendy! We are not like 'those' white people, the evil islamophobic bigots who freaked out over a suspicious clock! Pandering to minorities while insulting their intelligence in the process...A left wing pastime.

****Side Note: For someone to migrate to say, a country within South America, from say the United States, and not learn the language and culture is considered insulting and arrogant, by the residents of that nation(It's a slap in the face).  Leftists consider that racist in America, but not in Brazil.  Translation: Leftists hold non-white, non-Americans to a lesser standard.  A very perverted form of racism, indeed.  The kind Margret Sanger would be proud of.

The whole muslim dork incident is a conspiracy!(leftists say) The school, the police, and the entire state of Texas conspired against this kid!
(Because you know...Leftists tell everyone else generalizing is wrong, and then...They generalize Texas.  IDIOTS, and they don't see it.)

But how could the left see their idiocy?  They are to busy giving themselves brownie points while patting themselves on the back.

Everything they do is 'mock.'  They 'ban' the ""n-word"", they take down the confederate flag from South Carolina. Who's life was made better from taking down that flag?  Is the country now 'less racist?""

Or did it  just make your ""feelz"" better?

Feelz = Merica for loony tune leftists. Merica = Idiocy for Neocons.  Neocons = Exiled Trotskyites(originally)

Fascism was created by a socialist, and was influenced by other left wing ideologies.  Fascism = The result of A leftist demagogue who takes a shortcut.(Leftist demagogue may be redundant.)

(This could also be the result of the collectivized hive mind of the left. They lack any real individuality and fear going against status quos.  Which is what they claim reactionaries are. But it is them, the uptight young farts of progressive America.)

Leftists use those words(Strawman and so on)  like they use 'racist'....In a baseless and derogatory fashion, as a means of insulting, not providing an accurate assessment.  Typical leftists.....Exploiting human suffering so they can wave a wand of progressive self righteousness while they shove their morals down everyones throat.

Alright we get it...you stole words from the comments section of a news article and now use those words ad nauseam. It's annoying and is the trademark of a maroon.  Kind of like how leftists say ""OH YEAH! WELL UR WRONG! GESS WHY! THE KOCHS! RACISM! MY FEEELLZ! THATS WHY! AND OH YEAH FOX NEWS! BUSH!)

You silly leftists have not caught on to the reality...We don't watch fox.  It does not speak for the right, it speaks for Neocons.  Fox mocks the tea party daily and calls them far right extremists.  Oreilly's average viewer is 70.  An irrelevant crap fest, like Reddit Politics(Which also doubles as a Bernie Sanders circle jerk)

Leftist Argument = GO WATCH SOME FOX!

When leftists obsess over fox and the Kochs...It just shows how out of touch with the enemy they are.  Completely ignorant, propagandized little diaper wearing brats who find it trendy to hate whites, pander to minorities for butterflies in their tummies, and hate the country they reside in.

They claim everyone not left wing and atheist is anti-science....Yet they promote anti-science nonsense like men magically morphing into women because some propagandist media outlet perverts some brain scans and makes what leftists call a 'strawman' argument.

They claim to hate war....But supported bombing Libya.

They call the tea party 'extremists' while they support groups burning cities down, rioting, and killing cops.

They want the government to have a monopoly of force yet they hate the police.

They hate religion but love Islam.

They claim to want an open discussion but shut down opposing ideas as 'bigoted.'

They claim to ''hate the man' but call for bigger government.

They claim woman are viewed as 'pieces of meat' so they pose nude for feminism.

Been lurking for a while and love a lot of the advice here.  I'm not sure why I haven't posted here earlier.  Here's our situation; we're a family of four.  Both kids in elementary school.  Wife just started her master's earlier this year.  She started taking fafsa loans out for classes that have a 6.2% interest rate tied to them.  That seems high to me especially because rates are nowhere near that.  Anyway, we're on a single income and don't have large savings to draw from.  The savings we do have are for rainy days.

We also talk about investing in a rental property and so are planning on taking out a heloc for that purpose.

So, I have really two questions; 1) are there alternatives to student loans that we can look into with significantly lower interest rates?

2) if not, should we use the heloc for the student loans instead?

Maybe there is yet another alternative we're not aware of?  Thank you!!!",finance,1443277981

I also need to save money to live off for the summer. How do I do this?","I'm a second-year teacher in Chicago, still living at home because I can't afford to move out - but I really want to! The district I work for may strike in January and I worry I won't have enough money saved up to get me through that time. When the teachers union went on strike a few years ago, it lasted about two weeks. I would love to move out by January, but I don't know if that's even reasonable.

I owe my grandfather $3,000 since he let me borrow money to live off this summer. I owe about $4,000 to two credit card companies - Discover and Target RedCard. Last summer I bought a new car. My mother paid the $2,000 down payment and as of right now, I still have $16,000 left on the loan. My car payment is about $360 a month. It's a 2014 Nissan Sentra with all the luxurious add-ons. It cost about $22,000 new. 

Every time I say I want to move out, my mother says I need to pay her money back. The car down payment is the tip of the iceberg. She helped me survive when I was in school. I have no student loans since I had a full ride, but she paid for me to eat and she helped me get things for my classroom when I first started teaching. She also paid for my old car to get fixed when it was on its last leg. My car is only worth about $11,000 now based on the Kelley Blue Book because it got severely scratched all over two months into owning it. I told my mother I want to trade in the car for something used and cheaper and she said I was being irrational and she'd help me pay for it. I know this is a trap and am not considering it. Should I try to sell the car? It's worth less than my loan balance, after all. I need a car most for the weekends and when the weather is exceptionally bad. 

The RedCard's interest rate is 22%. The Discover card's interest rate is 17%. To be honest, my mother added me to her RedCard when I first started college before I had my own debit card or credit card so I could pay to eat. She used to pay for the card. It annoys me that she slacked for a few months about three years ago and now there are missed payments on my credit report. Since then, I've racked up most of the debt on that card and it's affecting both our credit. The Discover card is my own. Between both of them, there's $4,000 and I've honestly only made the minimum payments over the summer. 

My monthly expenses are car insurance ($100), gas (up to $120 when I have to drive up to 40 miles a weekend), Spotify ($5), therapy ($60), my car payment ($360), credit card minimums (about $150 for both), phone bill ($180 to help out my mom with our more than $300/month bill), and the gym ($10). I also put $100 into my IRA every paycheck. Theoretically this leaves me with a lot of money left over since I make about $1,600 every two weeks, but my district doesn't have deferred pay and they say we should save 20% of every paycheck for the summer.

My therapist made me a budget to pay off my credit cards and get out of debt from my grandpa, but now I'm wondering if there are any cards that I could qualify for that have 0% APR. That way I can transfer the balances and not have to pay interest. My friend gave me this idea and I've looked before and have been rejected by the credit card companies. My FICO credit is about 630 according to my last Discover statement. I pulled my official credit score (I forgot which of the three services I used) about a month ago and it was closer to 670. Is there any card I could qualify for to transfer my balances? My therapist's projected date for me to be credit card debt free is January 2016. I would be free from debt from my grandpa in March 2016.

How can I realistically move out? My therapist's budget relies on me paying about $700 a paycheck on the RedCard and then paying $300 on the Discover card with my next paycheck. Food has always been my downfall (along with clothes but not so much recently), and she budgeted $220/paycheck for food and entertainment. I would also pay my grandpa $100 each paycheck. In a month, this leaves me with about $580 to save if I'm really sticking to my budget and not buying beyond that $220. After my cards are paid off, the money I would have been using to pay them off would go to saving for the summer. It makes me wonder how I'm ever supposed to be able to move out - even with roommates.

I've given up on this sort of thing before because I feel like even if I'm out of debt, I still won't have enough money to go around. I'm scared that I'll never be able to move out and will never afford my own home or family. Please help me. I don't even know how much money I should have to move out. Rent in Chicago can be very expensive and my job is on the north side which is significantly more expensive than the south side. It's also not so easy to get to by public transportation which is why I feel like I need a car if I move out. Thank you in advance.",finance,1443282928

personalfinance,Why was I denied a small car loan?,"I was interested in buying a used car. I was going to be paying about half through cash and half through a loan. The loan would have been for $5,500. I ended up walking away from the deal, being unhappy with the loan that was offered to me through Capital One.

About a week later a letter came in the mail from Wells Fargo (my bank) regretting to inform me that they would not fulfill the loan that was requested on my behalf by the car dealer. I had no idea a loan was requested through them or that I had been denied a loan before that point.

The letter stated that they would not issue a loan due to ""Excessive Delinquent Past or Present Credit Experience, Lack of Established Revolving Credit, Number of Revolving Trades, and Insufficient Total Credit Limits."" It then reported my credit score as 743 by Equifax. I was surprised to be denied a small loan with such a high credit score.

Here is my credit history. I got my first credit card through Wells Fargo at age 18. I used it sparingly for the first year or two. During my undergraduate education, I took out ~$20,000 total in federal student loans. Each year the loan was dispersed in two payments. It was habit to end up running up a tab of around $1,000 on my WF credit card shortly before the second loan dispersement. I made timely payments and would pay off the whole sum when the next loan was dispersed. I missed a minimum payment one time by a few days and paid it and the penalty as soon as I found out. I recently finished my undergraduate degree and am 22 now. During this period, Wells Fargo upped my credit limit a few times without me asking. It is around $2500 now. That made me feel good about my credit.

I started using Credit Karma a few years ago. I discovered that something around $300 with my name had gone to Collections. The charge looked completely unfamiliar to me and I had never received any letters, calls, or emails regarding the payment. I lazily didn't look into it. Around 6 months to a year later, the charge was removed from my credit report.

This car loan was the first non-student loan I have tried to get. I was really surprised to find out I would have had difficulty getting it. I would really appreciate an explanation for the reasons stated by Wells Fargo. I would also appreciate any advice to resolve those issues.

TL;DR: Thought I had good credit. Applied for a car loan. Didn't get it. Why?

Edit: Just looked at Credit Karma again. It says I have six accounts: my Wells Fargo card, a Kohl's card I used one, one account for each of my student loans (3 total), and a Jared account that was never used and cancelled shortly after opening.",finance,1443295024

personalfinance,"I have about 57K due in credit cards and Personal Loans, along with a 174K Mortgage. Any advice?","First off, let me give some details. I don't have much in my bank account. I have approximately $1,000 between my savings and checking between 2 bank accounts. My take home, on average, is about $3500 per month. I make good money. My issue is that I have a LOT of debt.


Before I start on my debt and monthly bills, I'd like to point out that I already identified what got me in this debt, cut back and cut out a LOT of things that contributed to it, I don't have any addictions and I use mint.com to try to watch my money now. I also took on a second part time job on time of my full time job to make extra money, as well as sold a lot of personal possessions which made me some decent money but unfortunately, did not help pay debts as most of that money went to ""Bills"".


Let me give you an idea of what my monthly bills look like now:


$265: HOA Fees (Not built into mortgage, per month)
$93: eSurance Car Payment (Monthly)
$496: Discover Personal Loan - Due September 4th ever month (Still Owe $17,467.50 - 5 Year Loan @ 16.99% Fixed Rate)
$280.09: Car Payment - (Still Owe $13,969.40 - 5 year Loan from Bank at 3.490%)
$25.51: Water Bill
$1098.67: Mortgage - ( Still owe $173,146 - 7 Year Adjustable, 5.5%, will go up $200 a month in November)
Approximate Cost of Gas for the month: Estimated $150-$175
Approximate Cost of Food/Vitamins/Supplies for 2 weeks: Estimated $100
Internet + Cable: $120 for the month (I just cut this back by $100 for the month, I need both... they are necessities for my job that are paid for out of my own pocket)
$298.83: Visa Gold minimal payment ($14,975 left to pay)
$257.41: PSE&amp;G Bill (Estimated Gas and Electric - I'm trying to cut this back as well as I've had it down as low as $98 before)
$58: PayPal Credit Balance Monthly Minimal Payment ($1590 left to pay)
$155: Discover Credit Card minimal payment ($7,726 left to pay @ 12.995 and there's an 85 charge right now. I'm over the limit)
$28: Chase Credit Card Minimal Payment (1,183.86 left to pay at 16.99%)
$240 Left to Pay on a hockey season I signed up for
$20 monthly gym membership (Will be removing this)



That was my monthly, I also have additional info:



401K - $44,728.93 ($34,343.12 Available - Currently only contributing 3% and Have Outstanding Loan $10,385.81 Coming 
Directly Out of Paycheck - Estimated to be Paid Off by March 2017)


250 Shares of Stock in Company - Currently at $8 a share


CareCredit Available Balance: $5000 (Owe $0)
Master Card ($706 left to pay, not sure on monthly due to it being a new card)



Quarterly Bills
Municiple Utilies - $89.25 Due Every Quarter ($29.75 Per Month - Not Built into Mortgage)
Property Taxes - $1395.20 Due Every Quarter ($465.06 Per Month - Not Built into Mortgage)



Anyway, now that we have all the details, I'd like some advice. I have some additional payments coming up like a $270 Home Owner's Insurance, a $75 a month payment for Snow Removal from my association and a required bi-yearly chimney and duct cleaning service probably going to cost me close to $100.



I have looked into some options, but would like some opinions and advice as to what might be the best options for me:



1.) Selling my car is ruled out. I owe more than the car is worth. I would probably get $10K for the car, which would have to go towards buying a cheaper car that absolutely needs to be reliable as I drive 80 miles round trip daily to work (No, I am not switching careers or looking for a new job just yet as this one pays well and I very much like the job)



2.) Selling the house was considered, but again, I'd take a hit. The house, at the time, was purchased for $310K (I had plenty saved up at the time to live comfortable but a lot of situations forced me to spend more money) and now it's worth $237K.



3.) I do NOT want to declare bankruptcy. I'm doing all and everything I can to get out of this mess and avoid doing this.



4.) I'm looking into options of personal loans. So far, the best I could do, is a low interest 7 year Personal Loan for about $10K for close to $160 a month. Is this worth it? I was trying to figure out the math and since the interest rate seems lower, it will take me less time to pay off the personal loan than it would with the minimal payments on my card.



5.) Would it be advisable to roll up some of my debt to a refinanced mortgage? I'm looking to refinance to a 30 year fixed but not sure how to go about this (or the best option to us, my credit union is offering 4% but I'm looking into Quicken Loans). Any thoughts on doing this? I feel like it may be just like a fresh start for me if I can do this but need to know how to approach.



Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to give as much detail as possible for any advice and suggestions. Feel free to ask questions if you need more answers.",finance,1443298477
personalfinance,"Starting new job fresh out of college, want to establish good habits, does my plan make sense?","Hi All:

(throwaway account since details may reveal who I am, and I don't want my friends to know my regular user name)

I am a 22-year old female, earned my undergraduate degree in May, and am starting my new (first full-time!) job in 9 days.  Some background:

Assets
* Checking account at $1,500
* Savings account at ~$10,500 (accumulated savings from employment throughout college)
* 2015 Honda Civic EX-L

Debt
* Credit Union car loan @ 1.49%, $14,000, 36 payments remaining (just took this out last week)
* Credit cards (2), credit line of $6,000, no balance being carried


Income
* $67,000 base salary, or $2,677 bi-weekly paycheck (first paycheck coming on 10/16/2015)
* Expected annual bonus of $10K-$20K, paid each May


**Paycheck details**
* $205 per paycheck FICA taxes
* $123 per paycheck health insurance (high deductible plan), pre-tax
* ~~$250~~ $125 per paycheck into Health Savings Account, pre-tax
* $422 per paycheck Federal tax withholding
* ----
* ~~$1,677~~ $1,802 net paycheck every two weeks, which averages out to $3,904 per month


**Fixed Expenses**
* $401/month car payment
* $750/month rent
* $400/month groceries and supplies
* $75/month cable/internet
* $90/month electric
* $96/month cell phone
* $130/month gas for car
* $20/month gym
* $75/month car insurance
* ----
* $2,037/month total

So, I have a monthly surplus of $3,904-$2,037 = $1,867 to be used towards discretionary expenses and savings.  My company offers a 401k plan.  I can put away my own money now, but I'm not eligible for the matching contribution until I've worked there for 1 full year.  I'm thinking maybe 15% of my salary into this plan, which would be approximately $10,000 per year (plus raises, hopefully).  I'm also thinking of opening a Roth IRA and putting in $458.33 per month to max out the $5,500 annual contribution.  Does this make sense, or should I just put more into my 401k?

If I do both 401k and Roth IRA as described above, that eats up about $1,292 of my monthly surplus, but I think my federal tax withholding will go down, so I think I'll still end up with a surplus of around $700/month.  This surplus should be enough to meet my discretionary expenses for travel, clothing, etc.

If and when I get a raise or bonus, I intend to put half of the raise towards 401k contributions (or outside savings if I get to a point where I'm max-funding the 401k), and use the remaining half towards lifestyle expenses/improvements.

I am open to any thoughts on what I should be doing differently to improve my financial future!

Admittingly I should have seen these problems in high school as I was digging into college, but I was very... unmotivated/distracted back then (I still managed to get a 3.6 gpa). Now, as I learn things such as that I can't join the military without very specific toolsets, I can't receive federal aid, and the state of Wisconsin will not assist me in getting state aid, with most colleges not offering remission for my purposes, and of course, with the cutting of the budget for education by our lovely governor, it has become even more difficult. I was accepted into a community college, but was denied remission so they wanted to charge me $7000 a semester. For now I plan on moving out to Washington state where they have a program called WAFSA, which would (eventually) grant me state aid as well as in state tuition, but this is still a pricey endevour.

personalfinance,"[20M] Applying for student loans is proving rather difficult, could use some guidance","So here's my situation. I'm a junior undergrad, my parents and federal loans covered my first two years, but as my younger brother heads off to college my parents can't really afford to help me as much, which is alright, they're amazing and they've done so much for me, I hate asking them for all this money.
I applied for a loan before school started, my income at the time didn't quite satisfy them, plus I'd only had a credit card for a few months, so I didn't have anything to impress them with. My dad cosigned but because he runs a farm, he'd just taken out a farm loan (you'd think consistently taking out and then repaying the same loan every year for like 20 years would be something they would be smart enough to figure out) and so that application was declined.

It's ridiculous really, I'm working 3 (or 4, depends how we count) jobs part time on top of school. During the next summer I'll be working full time as well, probably more than 40 a week. The problem is they're all ""irregular"" to a loan departments eyes. Like I can only do tutoring during the school year because there's nobody to tutor in the summer. Research is full time and generally only during the summer. I've been working retail part time for probably three months, and I can keep that going through the school year and summer, but it's like 15-20 hours a week at $9/hr, so not enough to count as ""steady income"".

I applied through two different places (my bank back home and another campus bank) and both basically just gave me the same answer. Right now I'm barely making rent each month and the only reason I'm in classes was my dad was able to scrounge up enough for my tuition and I dug into what little I earned over the summer.
I'm just at wits end. I feel like if I could sit down with a real loan official and explain my situation exactly, getting a loan would be a lot easier, but since it's all online (I literally tried to go in person to both banks and ask about this stuff, and both times got told ""it's all done online now"") I don't stand any chance. Is there anybody who can give me some guidance?",finance,1443317615

personalfinance,"Received $50,000 inheritance, have similar amount in grad school loans (federal). Should I pay them off, or wait to take advantage of Pay As You Earn/Loan Forgiveness.","Using a throwaway, since some friends know my username.

I'm a current graduate student (finishing in about a year) who unexpectedly came into some money from my grandfather's will. I've read the sidebar articles and think I have a pretty good grasp of what's at stake, but I'd like to hear the community's advice on my particular situation.

My loans are all federal unsubsidized direct loans, so that's a 6.8% interest rate. I qualify for the Pay As You Earn program (payements capped at 10% of discretionary income) and my field is in the humanities, so I don't expect to be making a lot of money. My wife works too, though she also isn't raking in tons of cash (&lt;$40,000/yr). So our monthly payments will be low.

Loan forgiveness comes after 20 years by default, but I *may* qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (10 years). Whether I will qualify is up in the air, depending on where I get a job and potentially on how the government decides to interpret the law.

The plan I'm leaning towards is to keep the loans and pay them off the same way I'd originally planned to. I'll invest this money (probably in a mutual fund), and in a few years when we've settled down we'll have money for a down payment on a house. The other option, of course, is to pay off the loans immediately.

Any friendly advice?",finance,1443327634

I've been paying extra on them for the past couple of years and as of right now I'm paid ahead by about a year.  My question is, will it make any appreciable difference if I send them a payment biweekly (as I get paid), or even make random payments whenever I come across some extra cash, or should I just make a lump monthly payment just before the due date as I do now?

I know the interest on those things are high but I don't really care about that since I'm just buying cheap things to keep it open and don't plan on actually buying something expensive. Will this actually help raise my credit quickly? Should I get another credit card in four or five months before getting a car?

- Worked from Jan 1st 2015 - April 30th 2015 in California in a job paying $75,500 a year (i.e. I earned around $24,822 during the period I worked) with tax being taken automatically from my paycheck
- Did not / will not work the remainder of 2015 (out of the country and not working)
- No additional income from other sources during 2015
- During the period I worked (Jan 1st 2015 - April 30th 2015) I paid for medical insurance on a plan with the company I was with (I forget the exact amount; assume it was fairly standard) (not sure if this is even relevant)
- During the period I worked (Jan 1st 2015 - April 30th 2015) I did not pay into a 401k at all...
- HOWEVER... In April 2015 I emptied out the 401K I had been paying into the last few years. There was around $29,300 in it, of which I received around $23,400 (the remainder being held back for tax)
- My understanding is that I will owe an additional $2,930 as a penalty for withdrawing from my 401K early (i.e. 10% of the total $29,300)

In light of the above, I figure I should still be entitled to a little bit of a tax refund even after the $2,930 or so penalty I will have to pay for withdrawing from my 401K early. 

Does that sound right? Anyone able to offer a ballpark guesstimate of how much I will get back?

Thank you again for your help - I really appreciate it.

(And one last quick question - I usually just submit my state and federal tax returns via TurboTax. If I do that again this year, does anyone know if TurboTax will take into account the $2,930 penalty I owe, or is that something I need the contact the IRS separately about and pay them directly? i.e. if I do my taxes via TurboTax, will I get refunded $X + the $2,930, and then have to contact the IRS to pay the $2,930, or will that be factored in by TurboTax?)",finance,1443378566
personalfinance,~190k in student loans. Should I refinance?,"I have around ~$190,000 in federal loans at an average rate of 6.6%. I haven't consolidated yet, so I have loans ranging anywhere from 5% to 7.9%.  I work in law and will be making $175k (pre-tax including bonus) my first year (the salary increases lock-step each year). My original plan was to get onto PAYE as a safety net, but aggressively pay down the loans within 4-5 years (focusing on the higher interest rate loans first), while still contributing to a 401K and Roth IRA. 

I'm wondering, however, whether refinancing is a better call. My credit score is in the mid-700s, so I think I'd be able to obtain a solid rate. I was thinking of going with something like variable over 10 years (given that when the Fed does increase rates, it will be slow and gradual -- plus, I can just refinance to fixed if absolutely needed). Is this a good idea? What rates would this make sense at? I did some quick number crunching, and over a 4-5 year period (assuming the bank allows me to prepay without penalty), it would save me around $12-15k in interest. 

Moreover, which company is best? For instance, I know SoFi requires that you be admitted to the bar before refinancing, whereas other companies do not. I'm naturally a risk averse person, but if refinancing is objectively the right call, it would hard to pass up.

Loan 2 (TD Canada): 5.5 years left, approx $20,000 left owing, 7.24% interest rate.

Would any bank combine the two loans? I have my mortgage, banking and rrsp’s with TD, they are my main bank. Would I save enough to make it worth it? Will TD give me a better rate because I have pretty much all my banking with them, except for one loan?

That being said, my plan will probably be to sell the loan 1 car, since its valued at $18,000-$20,000 and then I can use any extra money after paying off the loan for loan 1, towards loan 2, and also the money not going to insurance and loan 1 can be rolled into loan 2 to pay that off faster.",finance,1443384862

I checked the wiki, the FAQ, and did a quick search about my question. I currently have about 20k at 6.8% in loans from grad school (paid out of pocket for first undergrad degree). Now I am back in school for pre-reqs for a new career (nursing) and received notice today from MyFedLoan that I am now in deferment because I am in school. Yes, I did apply for additional loans for my current schooling. My original plan was to keep paying my old loans and take out this new one (total of about $5k for pre-reqs and then a TON for nursing school) but keep paying down my current loans, effectively trading a 6.5% interest rate for closer to 4% (the alleged current rate on the new loans). 

I decided not to actively pursue going into deferment, and to keep making my normal payments on the loans as I have no other debt besides mortgage. However, I don't quite understand the difference between continuing to make payments while in deferment or not in deferment. I know that if I didn't make any payments while in deferment, the interested is capitalized, etc. But what about if I keep paying it down? 

TL;DR back in school, plan to stay on payment schedule. Do I keep paying on deferment for the next two years, or do I remove the deferment and truly stay on schedule? 

EDIT/UPDATE: ABOUT $11k is UNsubsidized and the rest is subsidized. I just realized this is probably useful information.

I have a paid off 95 Nissan maxima and I am handy so I have done all the repairs myself but I feel as if I should thrown in the towel soon.

financialindependence,Types of taxes: accumulation and post-FI,"Not just here, but on many forums even unrelated to FI, I see people talking about moving to various states because of taxes.  Often, states with no income tax seem to get a lot of praise.  However, I think it is important to look at the entire picture and look at rates of income, sales, and property taxes.  There is no free lunch, and a state with no income tax may have high sales taxes or a blistering property tax to make up for this revenue.

Has anyone truly studied how *different* types of taxes affect the FI community, both during the accumulation and during FI?

Some of my thoughts (which may very wrong, but I'm throwing them out):

Income tax:

* Can be deducted from federal income tax, thus it makes the effective tax rate a little lower than advertised

* Hurts during accumulation, especially if you have a high income.  Makes saving in 401K and (traditional) IRA even more important, and makes the traditional options more attractive in comparison to the Roth options

* May be less painful post-FI, especially if you have assets in Roth or assets taxed as capital gains, depending on how the state handles capital gains income

Sales tax:

* Cannot generally be deducted from taxes.  Rate is as advertised

* Less painful for super-savers, as sales tax is only based on consumption.  Sales tax probably has the least effect on super-savers

* May be more painful post-FI.  Sales tax tends to hit lower incomes harder since it does not have lower brackets, and lower income tends to equate to higher % spent

Property tax:

* Can be deducted from federal income tax

* Tied to an illiquid asset, tax can go up without increased income or increased consumption.  Most difficult to control

* Can be painful post-FI, if taxes on owned property go up drastically.  You could potentially be priced out of your own home


My perception is that during accumulation, low/no income tax is most important.  However post-FI, low property tax (I don't think anywhere has zero property tax) is most important.",finance,1443464539
personalfinance,Why do you or do you not have a Savings account?,"I've been pondering this question. I'm in Canada and I'm with TD Bank, and they keep on gouging me to get a Savings account. Last time I spoke with them I told them that the interest rates were so low and I simply had no interest in obtaining one. 

A reason for myself on not having one is that I don't want to deal with having both a Chequing and a Savings account to always keep tabs on and constantly balance between. With TD bank, you need to have a minimum amount in your chequing (about $3000-$4000) depending on what account you have. If I can't put most of my money in my savings account and always need to have a minimum in my chequing, why even bother? 

I currently just have a chequing account and I love it! My paycheck and daily transactions with my debit card appear through my chequing and I only have to keep tabs on one account and not have to worry about having a separate account for savings because I'm not someone that would recklessly spend their money. I don't need a separate bank account to allocate a budget to save money for the future. 

TD acknowledged my argument with them over the phone and in the office but continued to say that it 'extends our relationship between parties'. What a bunch of crap, you just want me to open a savings account so you can get a commission working as an employee.

Bitcoin,A Bitcoin-Friendly Credit Union COOP,"Here's the problem: 

Bitcoin businesses, especially money transmitters selling Bitcoin for cash deposit, can't find a national US bank with which to do business. Speaking from experience, there is in fact a war on cash underway. Cash is suspect, and Bitcoins are even more so.  Banks hear ""money transmitter"" and they run scared; They don't care about your compliance and your registration status with FinCEN.

We know better--we in the business, and we're not scared, and our combined efforts might be able to work around some of these roadblocks.

2. Stafford loans serviced by Great Lakes: six subsidized/unsub Stafford loans ranging from 3.4-6.8% with an outstanding balance of $21,000. The weighted interest rate for them is 4.4%.

* The sidebar describes avalanche and snowball methods for paying down student debt. Does anyone know if Great Lakes (or Stafford-holding organizations generally) apply my payments following one of those two guidelines? Does one clearly make more sense in my case?

* I'm planning to pay down the Perkins loan more aggressively because of its higher interest rate, though the first payment for it is not due until April, whereas my Stafford payments begin in November.

* Should I look at refinancing my Stafford loans? Having glanced around at refinanced interest rates, and keeping in mind the benefits of deferment/IBR/etc, it seems more sensible to stick with my loans as they are.

personalfinance,23 Year Old with ~40k Student Loans With a Full Time Job Acquires Bonus,"As previously stated, I am a 23 year old kid who graduated from college last year with my first full time job with benefits. (And took one microeconomics class which I blotted out from my memory, sorry.)

What I'm getting: 
I will be receiving a $2500 referral bonus in January 2016. 

My Status:
-I currently have about $40k in student loans split between private and federal. My parents pay the interest on the loans while I make payments directly to the principle; to which I have a sufficient income to do so. I don't know the exact interest rate but I believe Navient has us paying ~6-7.5% interest per loan (3 total).

-I currently take 6% of my paycheck into my 401k plan and plan to open up an IRA to start putting money away as well. 

-I do have an emergency fund in my savings account and basically stay afloat at a comfortable range from my checking account. I don't normally see a large deviation from that average number and my savings is never touched.
 
My question:
Where should I invest this minor bonus? Should I apply it all to my student loan principle with the highest interest rate? Or should I stick this into an IRA for funds later in life? 

Thank you!",finance,1443468204

personalfinance,Need advice on budget and making extra income (financial details in the inside),"Hello PF, 

I am writing this seeking advice because I am stressing over money everyday to the point that when i'm at work and I am trying to find ways to make extra money or reduce the money i owe rather than working. Which i know can lead to more problems. I provided a breakdown of what we owe and what we bring in every month. I have removed anything that was unnecessary to our daily lives, the remaining luxuries such as xbox live and netflix are something that we both want to keep because its an outlet for us to relax before bed and release some of the stresses. We have a child together so his food comes out of our food budget as well as our pets, so realistically the food for ourselves is definitely less than what is listed. We find ourselves short every month and im trying to think of ways to make extra cash to supplement, such as quizzes and surveys all the way to teaching on Udemy. None of these endeavors has paid off anything worthwhile yet. I'm asking for financial advice so that i can feel like im not a failure to my wife and to my child. I make about 42k a year as where she makes about 23k. I have about 64k in student loans and she has about 9k. It seems that when we get paid the money goes to bills and buying food and there may be 20 dollars left for that two weeks. Its very depressing when you want to buy things for your child and take your woman on a date every once in a while but you just cant... Ive been trying to setup a budget, but i guess i'm either terrible at following it or just suck at it.

personalfinance,Auto-loan charge-off question,"A family member of mine has two charge-off accounts on his credit report.  Trying to assist them, but I am not sure what to do.

The first is a personal loan with original balance of $7728 and was last reported on 02/2012.  It was then charged-off.  It is set to drop from the credit report in 08/2018.

The second loan I am more concerned about.  It is an automobile loan.  When he purchased the vehicle the loan company said they never received the title and drastically increased the interest rate.  This changed the monthly payment to an amount that he could not afford.  So he just stopped making payments in 2011.  The balance is 10,149.  The vehicle was never repossessed.  He says he does not have the title and the bank says they do not have it.

personalfinance,"First Job, ready to pay back my student loans, conflicting information from my loan provider Great Lakes","Hello everyone. 

I graduated school in 2014, while in grad school I worked to pay $10,000 off of my student loans. Unfortunately due to interest, I am now $6000 more in debt then when I started.

Currently I owe $116,411. The first time I called my loan provider for advice they advised me to do an income driven repayment plan. My payments would have been $244 a month and after 20 years all would be forgiven, sweet.

Looking into it, I acquire $588 in interest every month. After 20 years I would be forgiven, but my ~$200,000 in debt would be treated as taxable income... no thank you.

Next person I called advised first that I set up an auto pay, which would reduce my interest rates by 0.25%, consolidate the loans, which would take a weighted average of the interest rates based on the loan size, and then as it is a new loan set up an auto pay again to reduce a further 0.25%. 

Third person I called said this is not possible. I asked them to calculate the rates for me if I were to consolidate them and I was told my new interest would be 6.5%. In order for consolidating to save me any money the interest would have to be 5.9% or lower according to my calculations.

So now my third idea. Set up an auto pay, get 0.25% off and use the auto pay for the interest. Then attack the hell out of my large high interest loans. I have lots of small loans at low interest rates and two large ones at about 8%. I was told the only way to have control over which loans the money goes to was to make a second payment every month besides the planned one.

Any advice from anyone about the best way to go about this would be appreciated. I can't get a straight answer out of these guys, every time I call I am told something different.

FYI: I have 8 stafford loans ranging from $2400 to 23,213$ and interest ranging from 3.4% to 6.8%

I also have two graduate plus loans, 28,382 @7.9% and 14,784 @6.41%",finance,1443472408
personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to take out a second personal loan from a different provider?,"A few months ago I took out a loan from Prosper to consolidate my debt from multiple credit cards. That worked out well, I got a low enough rate that I will save money by paying off the loan instead of the cards themselves, and the payments are low enough that I can easily afford it each month. In fact if I'm really careful with my budgeting I could even pay off the loan in half the time (no pre-payment penalties). So I used this loan to pay off all my credit cards and I've been making loan payments on time.

My current problem is (I'm not proud to admit this at all) I also owe a significant amount of money to a relative for other past expenses, and I'm worried I won't be able to pay them back in the time frame we discussed. So I looked into a personal loan from Lending Club in the amount I owe this relative, thinking I'd rather owe money to some credit company than a family member. The interest rate isn't bad, I'd only be spending a few extra hundred dollars than if I just paid my relative off directly, and the monthly payments are well within the affordable range for me. It's still low enough that I could make extra payments to pay it off sooner.

So my question is, is it a bad idea to take out a second personal loan from Lending Club? Or should I see about getting another loan from Prosper (if that's even possible)? Or should I just forget the second loan altogether? Also I should mention my credit score is pretty fair (around 700). I have student loans but I always make those payments on time. Credit cards are paid off and I don't plan on using them until my Prosper loan is paid off. 

Thanks in advance for your advice! In case you can't tell I haven't made great financial choices and I don't really understand money, but I'm in my early 20s and I'm determined to get out of debt and start again responsibly. Thanks for reading!",finance,1443473376
personalfinance,Commercial Mortgage Loans are absurd. I need a way around these ridiculous terms.,"I'm interested in buying a local 5-unit multifamily home.  The asking price is very attractive, and the property would roughly break even in the first year, which is fantastic.  We are planning to renovate each unit individually as tenants leave and raise the rent.

I recently began stopping by banks and finding out my mortgage options.  Nobody would touch it because it's a ""non-conventional loan"".  They can't resell it to Fannie and Freddie, so they refer me to their commercial mortgage divisions.

All of their terms are ARM type balloon loans with 3/25, 5/25, 7/25 schedules.  The interest rates are roughly 1% above residential mortgages, and then they reset after the 3/5/7 year period.  They are 75% max LTV, which requires 25% down.  TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT!  Ridiculous.

It is absurd to me that a 4-unit multifamily home could be financed residential with pennies down, even if it were a shit deal and cash flow negative, compared to this place.  I don't want to put down 25%.  I'd rather put down as little as possible and then sink that money into renovations that add value to the property.  So I'm looking for alternatives.  Are there banks that will offer fixed 30 year loans on a ""commercial"" property like this?",finance,1443475049

**Terror on Moonbase Alpha** - Chapter 16 Part 1
___
___

Jacob had leapt off the platform out toward the emptiness of space, hoping that his path would then intersect with the mining rig.  It was a bit of a gamble considering all of the factors in play, all of the variables that would have to line up in order to make it work.

Leaving the ground, floating off into space, was a whole new experience for him - he had heard that the sensation of having 'butterflies' in his stomach was rather common but this was more like having a swarm of locusts inside him.  

In the silence, the isolation, his senses seemed to look for anything to attach themselves to - in the case of his stomach, he swore that he could feel individual food particles bouncing around in there.

The hardest thing to get used to was the inability to change his path.  He'd picked a direction and jumped and nothing -- well, unless he wanted to use some of his precious nitro fuel -- was going to change that.  

And, yes, he was moving forward, but that didn't mean he'd have to be facing forward.

That was the first problem that Jacob noticed, he was moving forward but he'd somehow managed to put a small amount of spin on the ball, so to speak.  His body was rotating, ever so slowly, away from the mining rig.  

It didn't take him long to realize that if he kept spinning this way, even if he did, hit the mining rig, it was probably going to be legs-first, maybe helmet-first.  Neither one seemed all that appealing.

""That's okay,"" Jacob whispered to himself and winced at the weirdness of his own voice.  ""That's okay, that's what the nitro pack is for.""

Jacob moved his hand out to the metal arm jutting out from the nitro pack.  The trick was to use tiny bursts.  Make little, tiny, minuscule corrections.

He wrapped his hands around the hard rubber grips and dumbly felt the large trigger buttons beneath his thumbs.

""Left hand controls left, Right hand controls right.  Easy peasey, right?""

First, he needed a reference point.  Something to help him orient himself.  Right now, only darkness, surrounded by darkness.  But there was a light off to his left side.  Jacob craned his neck and saw the faint glow of the moon behind him.

He began a search in all directions, looking for the mining rig -- he saw it coming up fast, from the right-hand side.   He hadn't realized how massive this thing was until now, how much this giant cube had dwarfed him.  

It was going to hit him and it was going to hit him hard - he imagined himself as a bug exploding on a windshield.

""Whoa, whoa, WHOA!!""

Jacob leaned backward into the nitro pack, lifted the arms as high as he could and slammed the triggers down.

putting most into our mortgage- it would reduce our monthly payment by $500, we come out at a gain even with the hit to the tax return. Refinancing would not get us a better interest rate.

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment question,"Loan background- In 2011 I graduated from a for-profit school with a degree I was excited to use.  After landing a job I quickly realized that my degree was worthless and I didn't leave the school at all prepared for the field I wanted to go in.  I was a great student, 4.0 gpa, and EVERYONE in my graduating class in similar circumstances- I've also heard (only after graduating, of course) that it is the norm for graduates of this chain of schools.  Sigh.  


Now I'm working and do not make nearly enough to pay all 3 of my lenders.  I'm currently only paying on my two private loans and not my federal loan because it is the highest monthly payment, even after having it lowered.  I plan on resuming payments when I finish one of the other two, but right now it's impossible to pay all three.  I've gone into forbearance on the federal one but that only lasts for so long.  Now I'm just avoiding it.


On to my question- What kind of damage is this doing to me by not paying?  My husband co-signed the loan with me- is this wrecking his credit score?  Will my taxes be effected by these loans because they are federal?",finance,1443535740

personalfinance,"My IBR payments (federal student loans) don't cover my interest. I could potentially cover them, but I'd have nothing left for savings. What to do?","I'm 27 with a $43,500 salary before taxes. I'm enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment Plan for the $83k I have in federal student loans. I used the loans to pay for 5 years of undergrad (Humanities BA) and 2 years of grad school (Humanities MA). I've worked for a non-profit for the last 2 years and thus I would qualify for the the Public Loan Forgiveness Program after an additional 8 years of payments made while under public/non-profit sector employment. I would not expect to make much more in salary if I were to find a similar position in the private sector. I can expect my salary to increase slowly over the course of my life, but it probably won't be more than $75,000 when I hit retirement.

&amp;nbsp;

Debt breakdown (as of 9.29.2015):  
$14,608.88 at 6.8% (Direct Loan - Sub)  
$64,476.23 at 6.8% (Direct Loan - Unsub)  
$4,590.30 at 7.9% (Direct Grad PLUS)  
Total: $83,675.41

&amp;nbsp;

Over the last two years I've made $6,254.10 in payments. $132.69 has gone to the principal, the remainder ($6,121.41) to interest. My monthly IBR payments (15% of discretionary income) right now are $282.27. I believe I would need $452.75 to cover the interest alone (30 day average).

&amp;nbsp;

I can tighten my belt/pay more per month and cover the interest, but I'll hardly be able to afford making a dent in the principal after that. If I were to put down enough to cover the interest, I wouldn't be able to set aside any money for savings (I was planning on opening a Roth IRA within the next 6 months). The government is expected to widen eligibility to Pay As You Earn next year (10% of discretionary income), and while that would mean my minimum monthly requirement is less it wouldn't change my interest problems.

&amp;nbsp;

The variability of legislation concerning these repayment and forgiveness programs makes trying to formulate a financial plan all the more difficult:  
-The Public Loan Forgiveness Program might not exist in 8 years  
-The government could step in at any point with a relief package for either principals or interest rates

&amp;nbsp;

I want to be able to pay back my loans, but these interest rates are killing me. I'm also terrified of getting married as current IBR proposals would mandate that my payments be based on total household income even if my wife and I were to file taxes as individuals.

&amp;nbsp;

What are my options for the short and long term? What should I do? It seems that the most pressing concern is interest accumulating and adding to the principal.

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"My wife and I have our own separate finances. She had saved up a good chunk of money prior to us buying our house and was able to put 20% down (~55k). We bought the house a couple years ago and have been paying our monthly payments ever since (~1400/month). I know that due to the amortization we pay very little towards the principal, but I'm bothered to see that of the ~33k we've paid in monthly repayments only ~10k of the principal has been paid down. From each payment only about $300 goes to the principal with the rest going to interest/taxes/insurance.

My wife and I keep our own separate finances and I'm pleased to find out that she has 50k in her account, I have 20k in mine, and we both contribute to a joint account for mortgage and other shared bills that has about 32k in it.

I make 60k/year and she makes 90k/year so we're doing really well by my standards.

If we refinance, we could throw 80k towards the down payment in addition to what's already been paid off. This brings the total outstanding amount down from 185k to 100k. Our interest rate would likely go up a percent, but our new monthly payment would be like $475 bucks over 30 years. Even though we would start over on the amortization, the fact that we're paying $1000 less each month would help us to save up and prepay faster. There's no prepayment penalty on our current mortgage and I would look for that in the refinance as well. 

This seems like a really simple way to save hundreds of dollars each month that I'm paying to a 30 year loan that I don't intend to have for more than 5 years. Is refinancing a good deal here? Is there anything I'm missing?",finance,1443546830
personalfinance,Use 0% APR card to pay off vehicle notes?,"Quick question. I have two vehicles (one @ 12% and the other @ 4%), both with nearly identical balances: $3,800. Both are near 50% LTV and in the first year of payments. I'm wondering if it might make sense to get a 0% intro APR card (Citi just offered me 21 months) and put my monthly expenses on there for a couple months and use the extra cashflow to pay off both vehicles in full, thus converting my debt from secured to unsecured and reducing my interest rates. The math seems to work out quite well, but I'm wondering if there might be some downsides I'm not seeing. Again, I would allow my monthly expenses to accrue on the card and roll over the balance for 3-4 months and rather than pay the balance off, use my monthly income to pay off my vehicles. Once the vehciles are paid off I would then start cutting down the credit card. I expect the whole plan would take less than six months to execute.

personalfinance,Should I take pension as lump sum to pay off credit card balance?,"Hi all,

I was unable to work in all of 2013 due to a serious illness, during which time I went through my emergency fund and amassed a lot of debt due to lack of income and medical bills. I've been slowly paying it off, but I still have a credit card balance of about $18k. I am healthy now and able to work again.

Recently a former employer sent me a message giving me an option to take my pension balance of $22,500 as a lump sum. I am 38 years old. I know there are tax penalties for doing so.

Should I take the lump sum and use it to pay off the credit cards, or am I better off leaving it as is?

Your help in all this would be greatly appreciated. This is a potentially very significant decision and it's a bit overwhelming.

EDIT: I added some details.

* Credit card interest rate is 15.24%
* My accrued benefit is $749.41/month if I keep my pension. So retirement age would put at $248,804.12 on my 65th birthday.

EDIT2: I think the numbers are wrong. I'm not sure how to read this. This is what the pension website tells me:



Plan | Today's Dollars | Future Dollars
---|---|----
Pension Plan | $61,105.90 | $106,914.84
Social Security | $390,410.02 | $753,953.83

It says my balance is $22,488.83 and my accrued benefit is $749.41/mo.

I don't understand how these numbers add up. I'm 27 years away from being 65, so 27 * 12 * $749.41 = $242,808.84. This is obviously way different than the $61,105.90 figure.

- My rent will be $1100 plus bills being around $90 a month for utilities, renter's insurance, and internet. 
- I'm not sure how much I'm going to pay for things like health insurance... and some other benefits like eyecare/dental/transportation that my job mentioned. I'm not even sure which benefits to opt into :/ I have no idea what makes a good healthcare plan. 
- I have no debt
- I have 21k invested in vanguard funds. The stock market is currently doing terribly :( I don't plan to touch this money until at least like 10 years or so anyway but it's so sad seeing my originally 23.5k shrink. But I get it, it happens and I'm in it for the long haul. 
- I have 5.5k (which is currently 4.8k lol) invested into a Roth IRA. 
- I have 40k in a savings account with Bank of America. I'm very unsure what to do with this money, just invest even more into Vanguard? 

--

My plan now that I'm starting my life in a new (expensive!) city: 

- I don't really like Bank of America for my savings account. Their interest rate is really low, they're poorly rated in general, and I am considering switching to Ally for their higher interest rate and high online ratings. I want to keep 20k in savings for emergencies. But I'm having a hard time making the actual jump... my family isn't super savvy with stuff like this. They picked BoA because it's such a large company.. so surely they're safer (their logic). They are very way of Ally since its online only. 
- Should I maybe instead join a credit union? There is an ""employee credit union"" for my company but I'm not sure if it's actually good. I don't know a thing about credit unions in NYC. 
- Should I still keep a checking account open with Bank of America? They have physical locations and I haven't had a problem with them... so far. But I keep hearing horrible things and don't know what to think. 
- I was thinking of how to use the remaining 20k in my savings. I was wanting to maybe allocate 5k into investing into stocks... maybe 7k? I want to hold stocks, but I haven't decided on any companies yet. I know how to value a stock using financial statements, but it's just such a long process I don't know if I have the time to do this. And how did you decide on who to use as a broker/medium? Is Robinhood any good? TD Ameritrade? 

---

Ultimately my questions are: 

- Is switching from BoA to Ally for just savings a good idea? What about checking, should I keep BoA? Should I instead join my company's credit union? 
- Should I continute to invest into Vanguard funds for my remaining 20k or should I look into investing with individual stocks? If so, who is your favorite broker/method to trade? 
- I'm making a very small salary for NYC standards. How can I make my 50k go the farthest? I think 50k is very doable in NYC, but just hard... 
- Should I pay a cost and meet with a financial planner? Just to at least come up with a plan?",finance,1443555145

I apologize in advance for all the text, but I wanted to explain my situation thoroughly! 
At 26 years old, I’ve found myself in a bit of financial pickle.  It’s slowly been building but I’m now choosing to take action and quit my irresponsible ways.  

My main problem: **I currently have credit card debt of $8,200 with a variable APR of 16.99%.**

I have a steady job and my monthly income after taxes is averaging $2,921.74.  

I make two student loan payments a month.

First Loan:
•	Monthly payment of $187.56

•	Current on payments

•	Principal Balance: $17,844.51

•	Interest Rate: 7.65%

Second Loan:
•	Monthly payment of $172.10

•	Current on payments

•	For this loan, there seem to be two types

o	Direct Subsidized Stafford with a principal balance of $7,038.02

o	Direct Unsubsidized Stafford with a principal balance of $10,170.36

•	Both have an interest rate of 6.55%


Rent payment is $930 and that includes water.

I just moved into my new place so I am not sure what my natural gas payment will be on average, but the hot water heater is centralized and I have an electric stove.  I think the only thing in my apt that uses natural gas is the oven, which I use a normal amount.  The first bill was only about $20.  

My cell phone bill is around $90 a month.

My TV/Internet is around $50 a month. 

I never set up an account for the electric bill and I haven’t heard anything from the landlord since I moved in July 1st.  Do I do something about this?  

I make a car payment of $152.73 every month to my father, who gave me a loan at 3%.  Current principal on that loan is $6,492.55.  It is a 4 year note.  

I pay $55 a month for parking at work.  I live a mile from work, but don’t think I would bike it during the winter and I also have a dog that needs letting out each day at lunch. 

I pay $35 a month for my gym membership.  I must keep very active and in shape due to some mental health issues. 

I pay the IRS $90 a month because of some back-taxes I owed due to improperly filing taxes.  These payments will be for a year.
  
Simplistically represented, here are my fixed expenses:
Rough Monthly Budget
	
	
Income	$2,922
 
Less
	
Rent	$895 

Student Loan	$360 

Water	$35 

Natural Gas	$20 

TV/Internet	$50 

Phone	$90 

Parking	$55 

Car Payment	$153 

Car Insurance	$110 

Renter's Insurance	$30 

Gym Membership	$35 

IRS Payment	$90 

	
Total Expenses	$1,922 

Income Less Total Expenses	$999 


So as you can see, I have about $999 leftover after all fixed expenses, but please still remember I have to eat, buy gasoline, pay for my dog and all that entails, along with the myriad of other miscellaneous expenses that always seem to pop up.  So that number is going to be way lower than $999 when all is said and done.

Now for my assets: 

Checking account: $685.15

•	Rent/Water bill of $930 is due no later than 10/3 :(

I have a “OP’s Company Name Retirement Savings Plan” of $31,139.30

•	53% is in Domestic Stock

•	34% is in Foreign Stock

•	9% is in Bonds

•	2% is in Short-Term (not sure what that is)

•	1% is in Other

•	“The current asset allocation of your selected accounts most closely resembles **Aggressive Growth**”

•	This account is vested

•	Under “Contributions” it says:

o	BASIC ROTH: 6% (which is the max amount the company matches)

o	SUPPLEMENTARY BEFORE-TAX: 2% (I am not sure what this means)

o	Employee Contributions YTD: $3,194.37

o	Employer Contributions YTD: $2,190.39

•	Unfortunately, I have taken out two loans against this Retirement Savings Plan when I ran into some legal trouble previously

o	They were both for $3,000 and have an interest rate of 4.25%.  So in total, each loan will have cost me $332.52 in interest.  

o	Loan One:

	Origination Date: 7/15/14

	Original Balance: $3,000

	Remaining Balance: $2,402.71

	5 Year Loan

	A payment of $27.78 is deducted from each paycheck I receive, so this loan is costing me $55.56 monthly

	Final payment date is 8/19/19

o	Loan Two:

	Origination Date: 6/25/14

	Original Balance: $3,000

	Remaining Balance: $2,355.61

	5 Year Loan

	A payment of $27.78 is deducted from each paycheck I receive, so this loan is costing me $55.56 monthly

	Final payment date is 7/19/19


I have 25 government savings bonds with Issue Prices of $25 and $50.  The first “final maturity date” is in 2019 and the last “final maturity date” is in 2037.  I went to Treasury Dept’s website and calculated the value of my paper savings bonds as of today:

•	Total Price: $925

•	Total Value: $2,169.64

•	Total Interest: $1,244.64

•	YTD Interest: $52.72

•	Can these bonds help me at all?


I have another Roth IRA account at a local bank back where I grew up.  That account has $2,655.21.

**The reason I’m seeking advice here is because I want to get out of this credit card debt and I know it needs to happen fast.  17% on a balance of $8,000 is most certainly not a good thing and I want to tackle this in the most efficient and financially practical manner as possible.**  

If I can get out of that debt, I can curtail my spending and live within my means, which I had not been doing before. 
 
So my main question is:

**What steps do I take to get in a better financial situation, eventually eliminating the credit card debt?**

•	Do I take out another retirement savings loan?  

•	Do I take 15% fixed rate loan from Wells Fargo?  They offered this.  Doesn’t seem like the best option.   
 
•	Do I do a balance transfer to another credit card with 0% interest?

personalfinance,What order would you pay these off in?,"I see it recommended all the time on this sub to pay off debt in order of interest rates from highest to lowest. **Is there a point where it makes sense to start paying the loan with the highest monthly interest payment, regardless of the rate?** I think this question is especially applicable for college students because most grads have multiple loans. I graduate in December and want to know which loan to pay off first. Here is some info:

Loan Number | Loan Amount | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment
:--|:--|:--|:--|
Loan 1 | $3750 | 4.29% | $13.41
Loan 2 | $2000 | 4.66% | $7.77
Loan 3 | $6500 | 6.80% | $36.83
Loan 4 | $3500 | 3.40% | $9.92
Loan 5 | $2000 | 6.80% | $11.33


Loan 3 should obviously be paid off first. Going by interest rate only the next logical choice would be Loan 5. If we go by total interest paid, shouldn't preference actually be given to Loan 1, at least until the monthly interest amount is equal to Loan 5? After that (going by dollar amount) I would pay Loan 4 until the monthly interest charge is equal to that of Loan 2. Does this make sense, or should I stick with avalanche method?",finance,1443561618

personalfinance,ARM VS Fixed-rate?,"Okay, okay... I know 90% of folks will say STAY AWAY FROM ARMs. Typically, I am on board with that theory, but I have been thrown a bit of a curve ball that makes the ARM seem a bit attractive.

About a month ago I was given word that I will be moving from the Southeast US to the Midwest for work.  The trick is, I will only be there for 3 a max of three years.  I was going to rent my house, but when we were getting ready to sign the rental agreement, the renter stated that he wished he could just go ahead and purchase the home.  Long story short, we are now selling the house (no real profit, just enough to cover closing costs associated with buying/selling plus any upgrades me made).

My wife and I kicked around the idea of renting vs buying and all of the numbers we worked up gave us a break-even time period of 3 years.  Because of this, we were looking at both rentals and purchase properties, but as the case seems to be in many growing areas, I can get a lot nicer house by buying than I can by renting.  Couple that with the fact many landlords/rental properties do not allow more than one pet (we have 3, getting rid of them or leaving them behind is NOT an option), we set our sights on buying a home.

I understand that with and ARM, I can get a much better interest rate, reducing my monthly cost by about 30% (based on the numbers I have run).  I would LOVE to use this money to 1) put into the home to increase equity/value and/or 2) put towards TSP/401k/IRA  to help catch up our lagging retirement accounts.

I would call it a 50/50 chance that we might end up changing careers and staying in the area once the 3 years are up and if that is the case, a refinance to a fixed mortgage would be a definite.

Am I missing anything else? Any other considerations to make?

personalfinance,Screwed by the Department of Veterans Affairs,"I wrote this letter, I'm not sure who to send this to, but I wrote it after receiving a letter from the Department of the Treasury today. What should I do about this?

To whom it may concern,

	I would just like to address the outstanding debt from the VA Education Department. Currently, as of today, September 29, 2015, this is the first time I have ever received any notice whatsoever of any debt I owe the VA. I have never received a notice from the VA Education Department. Not only have I never received a notice from the VA, but my first notice wasn’t even from the VA, it’s from the Department of the Treasury. It includes multiple pieces of information, which doesn’t even match what is written in the letter. The letter states, “According to the records of the Department of Veterans Affairs, you owe $1891.04.” Also keep in mind that this is the first letter I have ever received about a debt to the VA.
	Here’s what happened. There are numerous Departments involved, The Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Aviation Administration, Redstone College, The Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Education. I attended Redstone College for a few months trying to obtain my Airframe and Powerplant License. The license allows me to work on airplanes and allow them to return to service. It’s a license I’ve been trying to obtain since I was removed from the Navy for being a homosexual. The class is split up into six airframe classes and five powerplant classes and one testing and review course, so a total of twelve classes. I completed the full powerplant program only, because the Federal Aviation Administration had signed me off to take my Official Airframe Test. But, due to the Department of Education’s strict guidelines, I was ineligible to take the Testing and Review course because I hadn’t completed the school’s set curriculum, set forth by Redstone College and the Department of Education. Just to be clear, I wasn’t able to take a twenty-two day course, without paying over $20,000 in Tuition and Supplies, not including housing, to be eligible to take one class to achieve my long term goal. After sitting in the Testing and Review course for Redstone College, the school forcibly removed me from the class and placed me in Airframe One, the first Airframe course, which had already signed off by the Federal Aviation Administration. So, the VA Department of Education paid for the course, which I was not attending. Here’s an important part of information. The school illegally reported my attendance in Airframe One instead of the actual class I was in. There were many witnesses to this event. After having to go back to Seattle to actually get the license in-hand, I had to fly back to Denver on my own dime to take the Testing and Review course to finish the Powerplant portion of my license and finish school with an associate’s degree. The $1800 debt is from a class I never got to take until later. Also I had to pay an additional amount to pay for the class, which I had already started a second time. It costs me roughly $500 per class out of pocket because of my 80% eligibility with the VA’s GI Bill.
		So after all of this has happened, not receiving any notices or information from the VA Department of Education, I receive a single letter from yet another department telling me that I owe them money.
Due to the current “Default” that is on my credit score from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, I am not completely ineligible to receive any housing in any area of Seattle to continue my career and education because of the bad credit.
I hope I don’t come off as an asshole, but this whole fiasco has impacted my life so significantly, that I can’t even begin to explain how this frustrates me and those around me. I have included my Visa information and an amount equal to that in my checking account, $0.13.

I would just like to recap with some bullet points.

• I supposedly owe $1891.04 for a class that I never took since I was in another class for only three days; yet your letter specifies two amounts, $1891.04 is the amount you say I owe, but the next sentence says $2420.53, which supposedly includes penalties. How come there is a $529.49 penalty on the first notice?
• I completed the class since I have received this letter, why hasn’t the debt gone away.
• I’m not able to get a house because I was never informed of a debt I owe; instead the VA decided to send it straight to a default on my credit report.

Overall, I would like to request an oral hearing with the State of Washington, the Department of Education, Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to resolve this outlandish accusation.

Sincerely,

Edit: TLDR: Got double charged for a class that I took at a later point in life and they decided to notify me a year later. Now it's on my credit and I can't get a house.",finance,1443577858
CryptoCurrency,"Nu architect Jordan Lee: ""I created Nu to answer this question:""","""I created Nu to answer this question: Is it possible to supply society with the money needed to coordinate human activity without simultaneously creating mechanisms that reliably result in the slaughter and abuse of large numbers of people? Centrals banks are lucrative businesses. Governments capture central banks. Essentially the deal that is made is that if the central bank will fund the government then they can have their lucrative business. In recent times, the Federal Reserve has done much to fund war and terrorism. Shall we blame Janet Yellen? Hardly. She is powerless to stop it. If you were her, would you want to tell the Pentagon and CIA they are getting their funding cut? She is a quite vulnerable to personal threats against her from the US government. She is captured.

Let's consider reform on the political side. Some naive people would say an anti-war US president could be voted in to fix it. Perhaps a racial minority would be more sensitive to the destruction of brown people. Oh, wait, that has already happened, to no effect. Obama is constantly surrounded by armed US agents. He must be very afraid to take any action to cut Pentagon, CIA or NSA funding or interfere with their operations. He is captured.

Think this is just a problem with uncivilised Americans? Let's consider Canada, the land where everyone is eager to say ""sorry"" and produce a cohesive, egalitarian and respectful society. Surely such an advanced and enlightened society would not engage in the kind of brutality we see emerging from the US government funded by the Federal Reserve, right? Yet, the government of Canada has recently funded and carried out brutal and lawless attacks against people in Libya and Afghanistan without the slightest regard for due process. It isn't because Canadians are cruel or because Prime Minister Harper is evil. It is because both the United States and Canada employ the same flawed protocol that leads to such abuses.

I have come to the same conclusion as so many of you here: These problems cannot be fixed by getting the right person in power. I seek neither reform of the current system nor revolution. Rather, I struggle to create a separate and alternative system that meets the very real need for money. If people want to participate in our system and stop participating in the broken protocol that preceded us they are welcome to do so. If enough people do so we can transform governments and militaries in the same way the Catholic church or the British monarchy has been transformed into powerless figure heads. I dream of the day when the principle measure of US military force effectiveness will be expressed as the number of tons of food and water that could be delivered to a random location within 24 hours, in the case of an emergency such as a tsunami. It can happen. What is needed is the adoption and support of superior protocols, such as our own. It is the structure of the system, the protocol if you will, that is the problem here. So we have proposed an alternate protocol we believe can provide people with advanced modern money without the problem of destabilising and alienating violence. And it is no vague suggestion. Rather, it is an extremely precise collection of mathematical statements which can be calculated with great precision and is described in its entirety in our public code repository.""

worldpolitics,The Death of the “Pacifist” Constitution: Japan’s Return to Its Martial Roots -- by Gary Leupp,"The Japanese Diet’s passage of laws that allow for Japanese military action in support of a “close ally” when attacked represent a violation of Japan’s fundamental law, which (since 1947) has clearly banned the right of the state to go to war, period.

The three constitutional experts called upon by the lawmakers to comment on the issue all attested this.

This Diet members’ action clarifies what ought to be widely understood: there is no connection between formal law in what are fundamentally lawless imperialist states and whatever pretty postulates appear in the law codes of such countries.

In this country, we’ve gotten used to the fact that the U.S. government ignores the constitutional protection against “unreasonable search” through its Stasi-like rifling through our personal communications And we’ve gotten used to the fact that the U.S. executive branch ignores constitutional provisions for the Congressional approval for wars.

So why should it seem unusual that, while the Japanese constitution unequivocally forbids the maintenance of any military at all, Japan actually has the eighth largest military in the world? And that the Japanese ruling elite is preparing to deploy that illegal military more aggressively?

Let’s not be naïve. Let’s not take seriously those who posture as guardians of legality, standing watch over something they call the “international community.” Such people lie routinely, manipulate fears (about weapons of mass destruction, particularly, since that route of exploiting anxiety has proven unfailingly productive), spew out verbiage like an octopus spurts ink to confuse those who seem threatening, and parse the language of codified consensus to tease out from it deeply skewed interpretations.

Commentators in Japan and elsewhere are united in their conviction that Prime Minister Abe Shinzo has produced a sea change by forcing through his “reinterpretation” of Article 9 in the Japanese constitution. This isn’t just one more of those subtle, incremental steps towards a thorough rewrite of that document so despised by the Japanese far right. It’s a major achievement. A major step backward towards the glorious militarist past!

Some military officers are indeed saying, “We can do anything now”–anything a normal military does anywhere else.

It’s highly disturbing for me, as someone who lived in Japan for years, revisits periodically, is connected by family and friendships and deeply concerned about the future of that beautiful, fragile country. It makes me want to reflect on the military past of that proud nation and how it has shaped the Japan of today.

Let us start in the sixteenth century, when the first Europeans arrived in Japan, initiating contact, and the first Japanese made their way around the world to Europe.

On March 23, 1585, three nobleman envoys from Japan along with their attendants were greeted in an official ceremony at the Vatican in Rome. The Jesuit mission in Japan, active in that “newly discovered” country since 1549, wanted to impress upon all of Europe its successes in converting hundreds of thousands of Japanese to the Catholic faith. At a time when Protestants were making inroads throughout northern Europe, challenging and weakening the Roman Catholic Church, missionary work in the “newly discovered countries” was extending the reach of the Holy See.

Japan was among the most promising mission fields. Some of its daimyo (“kings” to the Portuguese priests), eager to draw trading galleons to their shores, were willing to convert—for thoroughly worldly reasons—and then command their subjects to do so. (The Portuguese merchants following Church directives notified their Japanese hosts that should they embrace the holy faith, they would receive more visits by the European ships laden with Chinese silks and other precious goods.)

Many religious conversions were insincere or coerced, and when serious persecution commenced in the 1620s, the great majority of converts apostatized. But for a time the Japanese were the darlings of the Roman Catholic Church’s global Counter-Reformation missionary effort.

There was a “racial” aspect to this enthusiastic interaction. The Japanese, wrote Francis Xavier in 1550, are “the best race yet discovered [by Europeans] and I do not think you will find their match among pagan nations.” “The people are white and cultured,” reported the visiting Italian Jesuit Alessandro Valignano several decades later, and even the common people so “remarkably polite” that “they are superior to other Eastern peoples but also to Europeans as well.” Around 1590 the Portuguese Jesuit Luis Frois opined that the Japanese “in their deportment and manners” excelled the Europeans in so many ways “one is ashamed to tell about it.”

(From the inception of contact, Europeans referred to Japanese as “white” and associated their pale skin color to moral virtue and intellectual understanding. Valignano even opined that the “difference between the Indian [South Asian] and Japanese Christians… itself proves that there is no room for comparison between them, for each of the former was converted from some individual ulterior motive; and since they [the Indians] are blacks, and of small sense, they are subsequently very difficult to improve and turn into good Christians; whereas the Japanese…since they are white and of good understanding and behavior…become very good Christians.”)

Before their Vatican visit, the Japanese had already met with the governor of Portugal, Cardinal Albert, in Lisbon; Philip II in Madrid; Empress Marie of Austria, also in Madrid; and Francesco dei Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in Pisa. (Francesco’s wife Bianco Capello had embraced each one, no doubt delighting in the texture of their silken kimonos). Arriving at the Vatican, cheered on by throngs, a cannon salute, and the tolling of bells, the delegation was greeted by the Portuguese Jesuit and humanist Gaspare Gonsalves who told those assembled:

“The island kingdom of Japan is, it is true, so far away that its name is hardly known and some have even doubted its existence. In spite of this, those who know it set it above all the countries of the East, and compare it to those of the West, in its size, the number of its cities, and its warlike and cultured people.”

Warlike and cultured people! Xavier had written, “Never in my life have I met people who rely so much on their arms…They are very warlike and are always involved in wars…” Even more, perhaps, than the Iberian conquistadores whom Xavier, a Basque from Navarre had probably rubbed shoulders with on occasion. They not only produced the finest swords in the world, excelling the Damascene blades, but they had eagerly embraced the arquebus from the day of its arrival in Japan in 1543. They made design improvements on the European musket and mass-produced it so that there were more firearms in Japan by 1600 than in any European country. (At that time a single Japanese daimyo might have boasted a larger arsenal than the queen of England.)

The Japanese martial tradition had deep roots. The earliest inhabitants of the archipelago (the Jomon, who apparently entered via Siberia) constituted a classless, peaceful society. But by 400 BCE they were joined by the Yayoi people, entering through the Korean Peninsula, bringing with them wet-rice agriculture, metallurgy, class structure, the concept of the state, and a culture of warfare. After the primordial unification of the Japan, which we can refer to as the “Yamato” state (sometime between 350 and 400), the state expanded into southern Kyushu and northeastern Honshu through military force and engaged in conflict on the Korean Peninsula as well. The monumental tombs (kofun) appearing around this period contain ceramic figurines depicting fully armed horse-riding warriors.

The introduction of Buddhism, a belief system that discourages the taking of life, in 538 may have softened the martial tradition. Although local armed uprisings remained quite common, the imperial court centered in Heian (Kyoto) from the late eighth century developed an elegant, peace-loving cultural ethos quite at odds with the culture of the hereditary warriors (samurai) evolving in the boondocks. But from the late twelfth century the samurai emerged as the new ruling class and retained that position until that class was formally abolished in the 1870s.

But back to Rome in 1585. How appropriate it was to greet some of these Christian warriors from the other side of the world, publicly in St. Peter’s! This Vatican visit marked the beginning of a long, tortured East-West love affair. The Portuguese, who monopolized European trade with Japan until the Spanish vessels based in the new colony of the Philippines arrived late in the century, enlisted Japanese samurai to fight Malays in their colony of Batavia in Java (later lost to the Dutch). The warlike Spanish loved the samurai at first sight, and recruited them as mercenaries for their intended invasion of China and their project for the conquest of Cambodia.

Alas, the love affair began to fall apart in the 1590s, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the great warlord-hegemon of a newly reunified Japan, began to persecute Christians and threatened the Spaniards in their Philippines colony with invasion. (Ironically, the first Christian missionaries to visit Korea arrived with a samurai invasion force numbering over 200,000 in 1592.)

Thereafter, the Tokugawa shoguns in power (from 1600) annihilated the Roman Catholic missions the Vatican had considered so promising. It booted out Spanish and Portuguese traders on the (valid) assumption that they would always try to smuggle in missionaries, and limited their trade with the west to dealings with the Dutch.

(The latter—Protestants content to keep their beliefs to themselves—made it clear they were not Catholics and not interested in proselytizing. They were altogether willing to ingratiate themselves with their hosts by trampling on Roman Catholic religious images and even deploying cannon fire on Catholic peasant rebels if that was the price of doing business in Japan.)

But then—surprisingly—these “warlike” Japanese stepped back from a century and a half of incessant civil warfare. Hideyoshi and his successors in power effectively disarmed the peasantry, collecting their swords and muskets, and corralled the samurai (some seven percent of the population) into castle towns—one per domain, of which there were about 260.

This resulted in what one historical anthropologist has called “the taming of the samurai,” accomplished over the course of the seventeenth century. Peace descended. Japan invaded only one country between 1598 (the de facto end of the Korean war) and the end of the Edo (Tokugawa) period in 1868. This was the Ryukyu kingdom (now Japan’s Okinawa Prefecture), which was attacked by the domain of Satsuma in 1609 and forced to accept tributary status.

From the 1630s Japanese were forbidden to travel abroad, with the exception of a few permitted to visit Korea or the Ryukyu kingdom for trade purposes. Far from being an aggressive country, Japan became withdrawn, engaging in a lively but carefully controlled trade with China, Korea, the Ryukyus and the Netherlands. (The Dutch were the only westerners authorized to trade in Japan until 1859.) Within the country, general peace prevailed; there were no daimyo rebellions against the shoguns’ rule, and no wars between daimyo. While there were always localized peasant rebellions in Japan, some of them repressed with musket fire, there was never a nationwide peasant revolt like that in sixteenth century Germany.

While Europe was ripped apart by the horrific Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648), the Pax Tokugawa prevailed in Japan. The warrior class, who were not a vocational category so much as a hereditary status group (including women), lost their martial character and became transformed into pen-pushing bureaucrats as the country entered a sustained period of peace. Under these conditions, the population doubled over the seventeenth century, agricultural production swelled, great cities arose and bourgeois culture flourished.

And so it would remain until the mid-nineteenth century when U.S. gunboats sailed into Edo Bay demanding that Japan open its doors to U.S. trade. British, U.S. and Russian vessels had encroached in Japanese waters for decades, with increasing frequency. Some members of Japan’s long peaceable samurai class called for a forcible response.

In 1808 (during the Napoleonic Wars, which pitted Britain against pro-French Holland) a British naval vessel snuck into Nagasaki harbor sporting the Dutch flag. Its crew kidnapped Dutch traders and fired cannon to intimidate the townspeople. Thereafter a shocked shogunate issued an edict entitled, “Strike against foreign ships without thinking twice,” which obliged the daimyo of coastal domains to fire on unwelcome foreign ships.

Still they came. U.S. warships under the command of Commodore Matthew Perry even entered Edo (Tokyo) Bay itself in 1853, demanding that Japan open its doors to the world economy.

Realistically appraising the situation, the shogunate bowed to pressure, agreeing to establish “treaty ports.” But the economic dislocations produced by Japan’s incorporation into the world economy, and the blow to the regime’s prestige among the people, lead to the violent overthrow of the government during the Boshin War of 1867-1869.

The shogunate was overthrown in this conflict, which took some 8000 lives. A new regime (headed, in theory, by a teenage emperor) focused on learning from the west while resisting further encroachment came to power. This episode is known as the Meiji Restoration.

Burdened though it was by the unequal treaties imposed by the U.S. and other powers, Japan quickly emerged from two centuries of relative isolation to become a global power in its own right. While the status category of samurai was abolished in the 1870s, a new system of military conscription and the national policy of “affluent country, strong army” insured the revival of the long dormant tradition of military aggression.

As early as 1873, just five years into the new Meiji era, the leaders (all of samurai background) planned an invasion of the nearest neighbor, Korea, to force its acceptance of diplomatic and trade ties. The plan was called off (mainly due to western objections). But Japanese gunboat diplomacy mimicking that of the western powers brought Korea to heel in 1876.

In the meantime the new Japanese government dispatched a naval expedition to Taiwan, to punish tribesmen on that island for the killing of 54 shipwrecked Japanese and Ryukyuan fishermen. Qing China claimed sovereignty over the island (just as Beijing continues to this day to insists that Taiwan is and has always been a part of China). After slaughtering dozens, Japan forced China to pay it damages and recognize Japanese sovereignty over the Kingdom of the Ryukyus (Okinawa).

Following multiple armed interventions in Korea, Japanese forces engaged the Chinese army in Korea in 1894. After Chinese forces intervened in the country (at the request of its king) to suppress a peasant rebellion, Japan invoked its treaty right to dispatch forces as well. The latter provoked a skirmish with the Chinese, and all-out war followed. It enveloped the Korean Peninsula, southern Manchuria, and Taiwan. A victorious Japan demanded and received Taiwan as well as the Liaodong Peninsula in Manchuria as war booty.

But diplomatic intervention by Russia, Germany, and France prevented Tokyo from swallowing Liaodong and produced smoldering resentment within Japan against the tsarist empire. This resentment intensified after Russia itself acquired concessions in Liaodong soon after thwarting the Japanese effort.

In 1900 when the Boxer peasant rebels besieged the foreign embassies in Beijing, Japan joined the western powers in suppressing the uprising. The Japanese deployment was the only Asian contingent in the multinational force, and met with praise from the westerners, the British in particular, for its professionalism. Suddenly the darling of British imperialism, Japan signed the Anglo-Japanese Naval Treaty in 1902—as the British dropped the onerous clauses of the unequal treaty the U.K. had contracted with Japan in the 1850s.

Suddenly British intellectuals were talking about the obvious resemblances between the two island nations—their monarchical, hierarchical, eminently polite societies; their maritime and feudal heritages; their proud martial traditions. It just made sense for the two to align, especially given the common concern with Russia’s expanding role in Asia.

Russia had secured concessions from China on Liaodong after blocking Japan’s acquisition of the peninsula in 1895. Japan attacked in 1904 and as its army fanned out across Manchuria its navy destroyed the Russian Baltic Fleet in the Tsushima Strait the following year. Russia was forced to sue for peace. It was a stunning defeat for the tsarist empire, the first such victory of an Asian power over a European power in modern times, and the cause of much nationalist pride in Japan. It brought Korea (officially annexed in 1910) into the Japanese empire, along with Russian holdings in Manchuria and the southern half of the large island of Sakhalin.

World War I would seem to have had little to do with Japan. But citing a clause of the Anglo-Japanese Naval Treaty, which called upon Japan to take Britain’s part when the latter was at war with a third party, Tokyo attacked the German concession of Shandong in China, seized it for itself and also seized German possessions in the South Pacific including some of the Samoan islands. By 1918 the Japanese Empire had acquired by military force territory from the subarctic to Polynesia. All within a half-century of the Meiji Restoration.

A very martial country indeed! Very impressive. But the Brits and Yankees were both getting anxious. Both wanted unlimited access to the vast China market, and Japan had displayed in the course of World War I a disturbing penchant to behave exactly like western imperialists. It had imposed the insufferable “21 Demands” on China, which London and Washington had intervened to soften. Britain allowed the Anglo-Japanese treaty to expire, claiming that postwar multilateral agreements such as the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 rendered it irrelevant.

Meanwhile the Japanese regime, responding to hardening racist anti-Japanese immigration policies in the U.S. and elsewhere, and craving Lebensraum outside its borders for its swelling population, pondered ways to expand the realm in northeast Asia.

Japan occupied all of Manchuria in 1931—more due to willful actions by rogue military units than as a result of calculated policy—and added the state of “Manchukuo” to the empire. The Manchurian Incident spelled the collapse of the League of Nations as the Japanese delegation stormed out following the League’s condemnation of its actions. All-out war in China followed in 1937, and a secret war with the Soviets on the Manchurian-Mongolian border raged in 1939. (In the latter Japanese forces were soundly trounced; Tokyo agreed to a non-aggression treaty with the USSR two years later.)

U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, constrained somewhat by popular isolationist sentiment, condemned Japanese aggression in China, proclaimed a “moral embargo” on Japan, and gradually applied more trade sanctions. Following the Japanese advance into the French colony of Vietnam in 1940 (in theory, pursuant to an agreement with the regime in Nazi-occupied France) U.S. sanctions tightened. The U.S. froze Japanese assets in U.S. banks and cut off the supply of oil.

Washington demanded that Tokyo withdraw its troops in China to their prewar positions in the north, and renounce its membership in the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, as a condition for the restoration of normal trade ties. The Japanese leaders, headed by Tojo Hideki, concluded that this would be politically impossible. (The public had been whipped into the sort of pro-war fever that so commonly infects modern capitalist-imperialist countries. Any announcement of such a capitulation to the U.S. would have produced mass outrage with unpredictable consequences.)

So the leadership, with only a year’s stockpile of the petroleum needed for the war effort, chose another course: the capture of the oil fields of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia). But that meant knocking out U.S. and British military bases in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaya, and Hawai’i. This was done, rapidly and efficiently. In December 1941 the die was cast.

Four years later, Tokyo and Osaka were fire-bombed wastelands and Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuked lunar-like landscapes.

The Japanese leadership did not surrender to the Allies because of the atomic bombing attacks. (These were in fact no more horrific than the conventional bombing that had fried over 100,000 in Tokyo on March 9, 1945.) The entry of the (hitherto neutral) Soviet Union into the war on August 8, 1941, the prospect of a Soviet occupation in the north, the division of the country and the possibility of a communist-led revolution, persuaded the leadership that surrender to the U.S. was the best option. Once occupied by U.S. forces, the Japanese people were obliged (in 1947) to accept a new constitution authored by foreigners that renounced the long history of martial culture described above.

And so a new era began.

Article 9 of the Japanese constitution is unequivocal: “Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.

“In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.”

Paradoxically, this foreign-authored constitution has—due especially to that article—become for millions of Japanese a fiercely defended national treasure. No one resists amendments to this document more fiercely than Japanese communists.

But U.S. leaders themselves having imposed the “pacifist” constitution on Japan began to change their minds shortly after its ratification by the Diet. The objective of the occupier as of 1947 was to disarm Japan in perpetuity, if not to return an industrial powerhouse to the status of an agrarian backwater. China was slated to become the U.S.’s great ally in East Asia, home of its bases, and limitless market for its goods.

Alas, a communist-led revolution upset all these plans. After 1949, as Washington’s politicians puzzled over “who lost China?” they re-conceptualized the role of Japan as a reconstructed newfound ally.

With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the U.S. pressured Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru to send troops to join what was portrayed as a UN effort against the communist North. Yoshida shrewdly replied that this wasn’t possible under the (U.S.-authored) Japanese constitution. (Yoshida was a firm anti-Communist, which is why the Occupation regime liked him so much; but he did not want to devote scarce resources to remilitarization at that time.)

As it happened, Japanese industry contributed heavily to the war effort, and Japan’s postwar revival was indebted to U.S. “special procurements” (war-related expenditures in Japan). Yoshida called these “a gift from the gods”. In 1948 the Japanese GDP was only at 55% its 1936 level; by 1953 it was at 155% of that level. Not “generous aid” from the U.S. but war-related spending by the U.S. produced Japan’s postwar recovery.

Under U.S. pressure Tokyo created an incipient war machine in 1950: a “National Police Reserve” of 75,000. This grew to 110,000 by 1952, following the end of the Occupation. On the same day that Japan regained sovereignty (April 28, 1952), Tokyo signed a “security treaty” with the U.S. legitimating the ongoing presence of tens of thousands of U.S. troops (who were among other things authorized to suppress any domestic disturbances). In July 1954 these “police” were reconstituted as land, sea and air “Self-Defense Forces.” Today they number around 250,000 active duty personnel.

A Japan Defense Agency was established in 1954—but not as a military, mind you! Just as “defense forces.” At least that is the official line. But would not any “land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential” be unconstitutional? In response to repeated efforts by citizens’ groups to deem them such, the Japanese Supreme Court (under documented U.S. pressure) has ruled that a decision on their legality is a matter for the Diet to decide and falls outside its purview.

Step by step, factions within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP, whose creation was midwifed by the CIA in 1955, and has held power from that point with only brief interruptions in 1993-4 and 2009-12) have campaigned for the abolition of Article 9 and the reemergence of Japan as a “normal country” with a normal, legitimatized military like those deployed by other imperialist countries.

But the Japanese people have not been on board the program. Local and national protests against the U.S. base in Uchinada, Ishikawa prefecture, in the 1950s (where U.S. troops had been trained before deployment in Korea) forced the base’s closure in 1957. Protests at a U.S. base in Tokyo in 1957 resulted in the arrest of seven people charged with trespassing. They were found not guilty by the Tokyo High Court on the grounds that the very existence of the base violated the constitution. (The Supreme Court overruled the lower court’s decision after the Chief Justice exchanged messages with the U.S. ambassador.)

The irradiation of 23 Japanese fisherman, and the death of one, as the result of a U.S. nuclear test in the Marshall Islands in 1954, fueled Japan’s anti-nuclear and anti-military movement. When Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke worked to push through a bill in the Diet renewing the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in 1960, over seven million rallied in opposition. Public opinion was overwhelmingly opposed to the security treaty.

But Kishi rammed it through in the wee hours of morning, after having dissenting legislators evicted. So great was the public outrage that Tokyo had to inform President Dwight Eisenhower, who had planned to visit Japan to sign the document, that Japanese security forces could not guarantee his safety.

This prime minister had been detained by Allied forces and held in Sugamo Prison on suspicion of Class A war crimes. He had been Minister of Munitions under Prime Minister Tojo Hideki and one of Tojo’s closest allies. He had spoken in support of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was deeply involved in the enslavement of hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Koreans in mines and factories during the war. He escaped prosecution due to the intervention of the fiercely anti-communist “American Council on Japan” who felt that he would influence Japanese politics in a “pro-American” direction.

Kishi Nobusuke also happens to be the beloved grandfather of the current Japanese prime minister, Abe Shinzo. Abe, widely regarded as a hawk of his grandfather’s ilk, has recently stated (on the anniversary of the end of the Second World War) that Japanese should not have to keep apologizing about the past.

During the Vietnam War, Japanese public opinion was overwhelmingly antiwar, and critical of the manifest racism underlying that conflict. But again, Japanese industry profited enormously from war-related contracts. The Japanese economy was growing by leaps and bounds in the 1960s, surpassing West Germany to become the world’s third largest economy by 1970. Although Japan produced a vigorous New Left comparable to those of the U.S. and Europe, the people were unable to wrench the country away from the alliance with U.S. imperialism.

Throughout, rightist forces campaigned to whittle away Article 9 and reinstate Japan on its historical path of glorified militarism. The Education Ministry, typically headed by the most reactionary and anti-intellectual LDP politicians (like Fujio Masayuki, who in 1986 called the Nanjing Massacre a fabrication and claimed that Japan colonized Korea at the Koreans’ request), has step-by-step restored nationalistic content to the required “moral education” segment of the high school curriculum; required schools to fly the solar disk flag and force faculty and students to sing the imperial anthem; and approved for public school use history textbooks that prettify or whitewash Japan’s war record.

Meanwhile the prime minister’s office has relentlessly tested the limits of the reinterpretation of Article 9. In 1981, Prime Minister Suzuki Zenko provoked a storm of criticism when he suggested that the Maritime Self Defense Forces be allowed to defend Japanese shipping up to 1000 nautical miles from Japan. Two years later, Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro (a soul-mate of his contemporaries Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Helmut Kohl) provoked further criticism when he allowed the military (“self-defense”) budget to exceed the traditional one percent of GDP limit—just to test the waters, and see how the public would react. He also sparked outrage when he addressed the U.S. Congress describing Japan as “unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Pacific” serving U.S. needs.

During the first Gulf War in 1991, Tokyo (necessarily) declined to send troops to the war theater. This drew fire from U.S. congressmen clueless about the constitutional issue who complained that Japanese were receiving cheap oil from the Middle East secured by U.S. military action. Some even threatened to withdraw U.S. troops from Japan (whose upkeep then as now is paid for by Japanese taxpayers) if Japan did not contribute to the attack on Saddam Hussein. (A ranking member of the Self-Defense Forces in a rare show of frankness publicly stated that if the U.S. wanted to withdraw, the Japanese would just say goodbye; after all, the Japanese had never asked for their presence in the first place.)

In the end Tokyo paid the U.S. $ 13 billion as its contribution to the war effort that forced Iraqi forces out of Iraq. (Arab states compensated Washington to the tune of $ 36 billion, while Germany paid $ 5 billion.) LDP leaders treated this as a matter of shame; “checkbook diplomacy,” they declared, should be replaced with an actual commitment of boots on the ground.

So in 1992 the Diet passed a law allowing Self Defense Forces to be deployed in UN “peace keeping operations” (PKO) alongside other international forces. It was an important first step, a psychological hurdle mounted. Since then, the SDF have in fact served duty in Cambodia, Mozambique, East Timor, the Golan Heights, Haiti and South Sudan.

The next natural step for the remilitarization campaign was the dispatch of a Navy tanker and destroyer to waters off Pakistan in late 2001 to assist the U.S. in the Afghan War. (These waters are of course far more distant than the 1000 nautical mile limit for SDF actions as envisioned by Suzuki Zenko.) This was a highly unpopular mission, terminated in compliance with a campaign promise by the newly elected prime minister Hatoyama Yukio in 2009.

Japan as a U.S. client state never expresses a firm difference of opinion with Washington on any international issue. (It is at least as deferential to Washington as Warsaw ever was to Moscow.) It is slavishly obedient. In 2003 as George W. Bush embarked on his war based on lies against Iraq, Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro (unlike the leaders of Germany and France) declared his full support and even committed 600 Japanese troops to the effort.

This was a major breakthrough for the Japanese militarists. The Japanese forces were not, of course, deployed in combat, hobbled as they were by that tiresome Article 9. But they could construct a castle at Samawah, in southern Iraq, replete such with homey amenities as a karaoke bar and massage parlor, whence they could venture out each morning—necessarily accompanied by Dutch forces authorized to actually kill people—to do “humanitarian” work like water purification and road construction. (As if the Iraqi people couldn’t do that themselves.) Two-thirds of Japanese polled opposed the mission, many no doubt seeing it for what it was: just another step towards violating Article 9 and normalizing international military deployment.

Koizumi’s successor Abe Shinzo—again, the proud grandson of the Kishi Nobusuke mentioned above—reconfigured the military establishment to create a Ministry of Defense with its headquarters in Tokyo’s Shinjuku. Its head, the Minister of Defense, now serves in the cabinet. In 2009, while another hawk, Aso Taro, having renewed the refueling mission in the Indian Ocean authorized the Maritime SDF to dispatch destroyers to the Somali coast to protect not just Japanese but others from pirates. Since then there have even been Japanese sailors stationed in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa—a very long way from home.

Much closer to home lay some uninhabited rocks in the East China Sea which the Chinese, who have visited them for over six hundred years, call Daioyutai. The Japanese term, invented in the 1870s, is Senkaku. Whoever owns them owns 21,000 square miles of fisheries and petroleum reserves so they are not unimportant. China (as well as Taiwan) claim them on very well-established historical grounds. Tokyo claims them on what it claims—very plausibly—are internationally recognized legal grounds.

But (again) doesn’t the Japanese government’s obvious disdain for Japan’s own constitution make us question what “law” has to do with it anyway?

Tokyo says that when it asserted its ownership over the four rocks in the East China Sea (which no Japanese were even aware of in the fifteenth century when the Chinese mapped, visited, and named them) in 1895 they were uninhabited, hence available for anyone’s taking. They were in western legalese “terra nullius” or uninhabited lands. No matter that the greatest Japanese geographer, Hayashi Shihei, had produced a comprehensive map in 1785 indicating that the islands were Chinese. No matter that the Japanese foreign minister, Inoue Kaoru, had rejected a plea for annexation from the governor of Okinawa in 1885 on the grounds that the islands belonged to China.

All that matters is that when rising Japan defeated China in 1895 and impressed the western powers, asserting ownership of these islands in the course of the war (before acquiring adjacent Taiwan itself as a colony), the predatory imperialist powers accepted Japan’s claim. How legitimating! Ever since Japan has had “law” on its side. So what does history have to do with it? (Seriously. I have heard a Japanese diplomat put it in precisely these terms.)

But this islands dispute is actually more complicated, even from the legalistic point of view. In the Cairo Declaration of 1943, wartime victors Roosevelt, Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek declared that, following its unconditional surrender, “Japan shall be stripped of all the territories it has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa and the Pescadores which shall be restored to the Republic of China.” This demand was reiterated at Potsdam by Truman, Churchill and Stalin. In defeat Tokyo conceded the loss of these possessions.

But the status of the Diaoyutai/Senkaku islands remained unclear. They came under the U.S. Ryukyu occupation zone, which was separate from the zone comprising the Japanese main islands. (Since Japan had annexed the Ryukyus in the 1870s the Occupation authorities were not sure whether or not to treat them as part of Japan or as a potential independent state.) The U.S. could, in 1945, when China was led by the united front between Chiang Kai-shek’s Guomindang and the communists, assigned the disputed islands back to China with the stroke of a pen. Instead they retained them within the bounds of Okinawa Prefecture.

In 1972 the U.S. “returned” the Ryukyu islands to Japanese sovereignty (while retaining, indeed insisting on, the right to station 25,000 troops on bases on Okinawa). The Diaoyutai islands reverted with the whole package and now Tokyo assumes that if blows were to come between it and Beijing over this island claim issue, the U.S. will take its part. After some hedging the U.S. has in fact stated clearly that the security treaty between the U.S. and Japan covers these disputed islands.

This is a major triumph for Kishi Nobusuke’s grandson. As he steers Japan towards the status of a “normal” global power, able to bully other nations like the U.S. does—-able to expand Japan’s influence throughout Greater East Asia (unapologetically)—-he can count on the Yankees to have his back. He has restored Japan to the ranks of the white, civilized nations. He is nurturing those warlike roots. Everything’s back on track, just like it was before these annoying pacifist decades.

But this time the “warlike and cultured people” stand astride a fading U.S. empire trying to “pivot” towards the South and East China Seas confronting an inexorably rising China. This China so far proceeds cautiously in pressing its claims, territorial and otherwise. Kishi’s grandson in contrast is a hothead whose vision of military revival—tapping into the gangster-neofascist right that’s always there on the fringes of Japanese politics—-could produce something very ugly, pretty soon.

The Japanese government’s outright purchase of the Daioyu/Senkaku islands from a private owner in September 2012 (which was actually opposed by Washington as an unnecessary provocation of China) may in time be viewed as the beginning of a new stage of confrontation.

The pattern in retrospect is very clear. Step by step the militarists have gained ground in Japan. They scored a big victory last week. The Japanese constitution of 1947 means nothing. Hachiman (the god of war) is smiling. Back to normal, the norm of two millennia. The samurai are back in the saddle, heading for the battlefield, with the stars and stripes alongside the imperial solar disc flag waving in the background.

Back when there were some interests, I used to keep ~3,000 in the bank account (0.5% interest rate) , 7,000 in a deposit account (can be accessed in 2 working days maximum) at a decent 1 to 2 % interest rate, and the last 10,000 ones in a bounded deposit for 6 or 12 months at a higher interest rate (3-4%). This bounded deposits usually allowed me in case of emergency to recover all the money in a week or so, if I accepted to lose all the interests. 

Now, I've got basically 0% interest rate on my bank account (75% of the 1 month euribor.... basically I'm lucky that I haven't got negative interests given that now this index is negative!!!). The deposit account gives me a whopping 0.35% interest rate (with 26% tax!) and if I bound more than 10k for a whole year I could get a whole 1% rate (still with 26% tax).

1. Fees: I don't want to have to pay to do basic transactions (so avoiding monthly fees, per check fees and fees for account assistance).  Are there fees for not using the local branch when using an atm card?  Is there a minimum required balance?  Are there limits on the number of transactions?

2. Services: do they offer mobile depositing? Is there an option for online bill pay?  Is transferring money to other banks easy?  Do they have good customer service?

3. Interest rates: this would be for both deposited money and for loans.  Ideally, higher than average for credits and lower than average for debts.

4. Incentives:  are there any incentives for opening a new account?  Any for having an account for an extended period of time, ie customer loyalty?

I have a credit card with 0% interest for another 12 months, the balance on that is currently $3,600. My school loan balance (which have 3.8% interest) is $25K. Those repayments start in November. I want to be able to save up as much money as possible while still paying the credit card debt off in a reasonable amount of time. I know I have time to pay off the school loans, and with 3.8% interest rate, I don't want to be throwing my entire paycheck at it per month unless I need to. What are your thoughts? Am I in trouble with this amount of CC and school loan debt provided my current income? I currently work 40hrs/week, sometimes there is overtime, but the above pay isn't including any overtime. Please let me know what you think, I don't want to think my finances are OK if I am really headed for a catastrophe. Thank you!

EDIT: I see that I am fine, thanks for the support and advice everyone. I really appreciate it. I am working on making a budget for myself and figuring out just how much I want to put towards each debt per month.",finance,1443626449

investing,Are leverage etf better than investing on margin?,"with their 0.95% expense ratio (so if you invest 50k you pay  475 a year in fees), arent leveraged etf a better option  if you plan on investing on margin?

if you have 50k and want to invest 150k on margin, you will pay interests on 100k, say 1.5% is the interest rate, and you will pay a total of 1500 a year in interest, + you will have to actively manage your funds to stay at the same leverage (and risk getting margin calls too)

of course leverage etf dont track the performance of the index well because they track something different than this, which is daily performance, but the expected value is basically the same, just with more variance.

Please do not talk about the decaying efect of the leverage etf, the same decaying effect will happen if you play on margin and keep the same leverage at all time, the idea here is to compare between the two.",finance,1443626954

Long time lurker here, my fiancee and I are considering purchasing a rental property(multifamily?) and we are looking for some advice! 


**About us:**

Me: 23(M)

Income:
 
* $36,000Net from my job (small software company, I like it most of the time, and there’s room for growth+raises)

* $200-400/month net from a small eBay business

My Debts: 

* $18,200 Student loans (all Federal, interest 3.4-6.55%, monthly min. payment is $380, but I've been paying off more of the 6.55%)

* $7,500, no interest, two year 500-hour Yoga Training, I’m not intending on becoming a yoga teacher full-time, just supplemental income and personal well-being. Payment is pay-as-you-can, as the teacher is very non-financially motivated, but I would like to keep up with regular payments every 3 months.  


Fiancee:

Income: 

* $20,000Net, she’s currently working full-time, but job hunting for part-time work while she focuses on Yoga Teacher training. 

Her Debts: NONE!

**Monthly Budget**

•	$1200 Rent/Utilities/Internet

•	$400 groceries

•	$80 auto insurance

•	$200 fuel/auto maintenance

•	$100 personal items

•	$300 yoga training

•	$380+ student loans

•	$200+ Savings

•	$150 dates/misc. 

•	Total = $3010/monthly

Our combined monthly net income is about $3400


**Other Information:**


Located about an hour west of Chicago.


We both have credit scores over 750, and paid-off vehicles with less than 50k miles. We currently rent a 1 bedroom apartment with all utilities/parking/internet for $1200/month. Rent is expensive in the suburbs. We don’t plan on having a big, fancy wedding, and would like to cap our budget at $5k (mainly for food). 


I don’t think we can afford to rent AND own a rental property (feel free to tell me otherwise), so I like the idea of buying a duplex or multi-unit place where we can live in one unit and rent the other(s). Her Dad has 4 rental properties and is familiar with the rental game, he thinks it is a good idea, if we decide to move he will take care of the property for us. I’m very handy with cosmetic remodeling, so a cosmetic fixer-upper is an option. 


Combined we can scrape together $20k for a down payment, and are looking at a 15 or 20yr mortgage. 


So we seek your advice…

* 1. Is this a good/bad idea? 
* 2. What price range for a duplex/multifamily property should we look into?
* 3. What else do we need to know? We don’t know what we don’t know. 
* 4. Suggested reading? 


Thanks in advance, if I missed some information that would be useful, let me know.

personalfinance,Why did my federal tax rate more than double for my vacation pay out,"Hi all. I recently switched jobs and was supposed to be paid out roughly 12 vacation days. Despite getting paid for for almost 2 and half weeks of work, my net pay was not much more than a regular 2 week pay check.

I was looking at my vacation pay out and was surprised to see how little it is.

A normal by weekly pay check grossed $2,000.00 with a net return of roughly $1,337. Federal income tax collected is was about $196.

My vacation payout was for $2,654, but the net return was only $1,419. Federal income tax collected was $663.

Why on Earth did my federal income tax rate increase so dramatically for the vacation payout? Is this an error?

personalfinance,Considering Selling my Owner-Occupied Rental House to Finance a New Build...Advice Needed!,"Hey Guys,

I'm 25, working full time ($70k/year), living in Canada.

I finished a house project early last spring, it costed a lot to finish (approximately $50k plus a $25k down payment bringing the total investment to about $450k including the mortgage) however the house was appraised at $650k, but I could realistically sell it for about $600k given the current real estate market.

I've been living in the house for over a year now, so if I sold I wouldn't have to pay capital gains, the income would be 100% tax free.

I had a tenant in the basement paying $1600/month for a year, and just signed new tenants in September for $1400/year for two years.

My mortgage payment is $1625/month @ 2.99 fixed, and the utilities for both suites including property taxes, TV, and Internet are approximately $1000/month.

My question to Personal Finance is...
Should I rent out two of my bedrooms in my suite to my friends for an additional $1000/month?

Or should I sell the house, take the capital I made from the sale, and finance a new build, with a much lower mortgage, better interest rate, and do the same style of house with tenants in the basement and my friends renting upstairs with me.

If I left anything out I apologize...I would like to stay ahead of the curve for my age! Thanks",finance,1443628233

personalfinance,I unknowingly bought an $80k home that needs $80k worth of work; consult the courts or walk away?,"I'm hoping to get some advice on the circumstances I have found myself in today. Incoming wall of text.

(TLDR: Attempting to move; house is listed for $80k; discovered $70k-$80k of necessary repairs this morning. What are my options? Located in Arkansas)

First, a bit of background: My wife and I purchased our home (located in Arkansas) roughly six years ago for $82,000 on a Rural Development loan with a 4.5% interest rate. During the sale, the house was appraised over the offer and we had an inspection done, which turned up a few, relatively minor problems that we were comfortable with repairing. Over the first two months of living in the house we discovered numerous problems that were not noted during the inspection. After several thousand dollars of out of pocket expenses we brought the inspector to small claims court and won a $5,000 settlement (maximum allowed for small claims). 

Fast forward to today. I'm working 80 miles from home and have been commuting for 3 years. This and a variety of other reasons have finally convinced us to move. In our time at the house we have put a significant amount of time and money in to repairs / improvements (remodeling the bathroom entirely, replacing drywall / repairing mold damage, enclosing the carport in to a garage, etc), but due to the age of the house (70+ years), condition of some of the rooms we have not yet remodeled, and the local market, we have listed it for $80,000 hoping for a reasonably quick and painless sale so we can get out and move closer to my work. We have had some people look at the house and all have questioned the front wall of the house. It is a brick house built on a steep hill and the front wall is buckled. This was the case when we bought the house as well, so I've been waiting for another couple who is less concerned about this, however I did have a foundation expert come out to provide me some information that I can offer to anyone concerned about the wall. 

The call I got this morning from the foundation guy was definitely not what I was hoping to hear. He estimates 70-80 thousand dollars for a proper drainage system, retaining wall, and repairs to the home. He says the footings are all concave and that the cost is going to exceed the value of the house. I called my realtor and she recommended we either attempt to sell to a rental property buyer who won't worry about it, but this would involve taking a huge loss. We owe around $75,000 and a rental owner would likely offer us 60-70k. 


We have made every payment on time and in full, and have never had any major problems financially. I never thought I would even consider walking away from a loan, much less one that I am fully capable of paying. At this point, however, I do not know what other options I have. I plan to consult with a lawyer regarding the possible ramifications of allowing the mortage to go in to foreclosure, but I'm also interested in what you all may have to say.",finance,1443639484
Bitcoin,banks are treating their customers like criminal and i am literally depending on bitcoin atm for now.,"so here is the story. used e-trade checking for few months and suddenly one day got a letter and also voice mail from them saying my check card was closed to due ""security"". Transactions are denied at the store and can not get any of my cash. Told them I need to enable my card back and they agreed sending me a new debit card through mail. Needless to say it takes 2 calls to their customer service and finally sends me the card. Turns out send it through fedex and fedex messes up the shipment due to signature issue. I contacted them again and etrade says can not send check card unless signature is needed. So much for a single debit card.

I decided to switch the chase bank and opened a new checking account and set direct deposit along with 6000$ initial deposit.

I tried to withdraw 100$ out of my 6000$ few days later at the ATM and transaction denies. Just outside from atm, i call customer service for chase account and I input my whole 16 digit card number and last 4 digits of SSN to go through a maze to reach a customer service. Once connected to live person then they ask for whole 16 digit card number again and also verifies the address, last name, last 4 digits of SSN again for ""security"" and service personnel gives a so much of an apology for having this trouble but then, she says i  have to go to branch.

What those incidence tells me? It just means a bullshit and hypocrisy. It literally means banks are treating their customers like a criminal suspect with extensive checking and interrogation to do a daily stuff.

I am currently looking at actually bitcoin atm to depend on any cash transaction because of these craps. Luckily there is one available within 15miles of my work. I will see how it will go on.",cryptocurrency,1443640274

personalfinance,"Hi, you might recognize me as the guy who is constantly telling people to join Ally Bank. Today, I lost all confidence in their security and am closing my account.","I have been a huge supporter of Ally Bank for a long time, and have made tons of posts on here encouraging others to join. I loved them for a variety of reasons, such as their great interest rate and good customer service, but the main selling point for me was their focus on security. 

Specifically, two features: two factor authentication (in my opinion, something that is 100% necessary for banking, in order to keep out unauthorized logins) and custom telephone verification questions (another great tool not only to identify me, but to identify Ally if they call me).

Last week, I got a new phone and set it up, and logged into my Ally account. I was surprised to be logged straight into it, with no prompt for 2FA. There was no reason for them to think it was me and in fact reasons to think it wasn't me: it was a brand new phone, logging in from a completely different state then I live. 

I called Ally to inquire what was going on. As they were verifying me, they *did not ask me my verification question* but rather verified me via the normal stuff (SSN, address, DOB etc). After talking to tech support, they had no idea why it wasn't working and agreed to follow up.

The next day (yesterday), I got a phone call from Ally following up. They started the verification procedure (which again did not include my verification question), and I failed, since I was apparently giving them the wrong D.O.B. Whatever they had on file did not match my date of birth (which was correct yesterday). I was told they couldn't proceed any further until loss prevention could verify my identity the next day (today). 

I then became alarmed that my account had been accessed by someone else, so I asked them to verify that my account would be *locked* until we got this dealt with. I was told that my account would be indeed locked and could not be accessed at all. That night, when I got home, I logged into my account without any problem (or even a 2FA prompt), and managed to change my password and security question. I also saw that my DOB was off by 5 days. 

This morning, I got a call from Loss Prevention. The lady immediately started the verification procedure again (SSN, Maiden Name, DOB). When we got to the DOB, I told her the correct DOB as well as the one they had on file. She accepted that as enough information to confirm me and said she changed the DOB to the correct one. **At no point in this phone call did she attempt to verify me by any other means, such as a Driver's License, apart from what I verbally told her. She only used the same information that I failed on yesterday.** 

I then asked her why I was able to access my account, and she just kept repeating that the account was locked. She was not able to explain why none of their security works and told me to contact Tech Support again. I got a supervisor on the phone, who was equally clueless. 

I am completely flabbergasted at this complete security failure. Luckily, it was just me accessing my account but if it was someone else, they could have easily gotten access to via numerous failures in their system.

TLDR:

* Despite having 2-Factor Authentication enabled, I am never prompted for a code, even when logging in via a strange phone in a different state.

* Despite having a custom security verification question/answer set, I am never asked for it during verification.

* I failed verification, after my DOB randomly changed on their website. 

* After failing verification, I was told my account would be locked from access until my identity was confirmed. I was able to log in and change my password later that day.

* When Loss Prevention called the next day to verify my identity, they asked for no additional information to verify me (such as a Drivers License), other then the exact same verification questions they asked me the previous day (that I failed on)


Edit: New update, got another phonecall from Ally today. The person (from Loss Prevention, no less) did not do any verification at all, then during the course of the phone call told me the answer to my security question. Sweet.",finance,1443640579

I do not have US citizenship. Would probably apply for a working holiday visa and be partially supported by him until I could get a more legit work permit. He earns $90,000+ and says he would support me in dealing with debt etc. but I know it's foolish to rely on that entirely when it comes to giving myself security.

I make a little over 45K a year. I officially entered student loan re-payment back in July. Debt totaled up to 42K. All of my loans are Federal Stafford Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans, nothing private or outside of that.

So far, I currently have 36,700 left. Due to living with a parent and not having a car (yet), I've been trying to pay everything down as much as I can. 

The biggest reason I'm where I'm at with my debt is due to paying certain loans in full. I've paid a $501 and a $1400 loan in full. However, I'm wondering if I should stop doing this and reverting to the 2nd strategy of paying $50-200 more than my minimum payment ($242.00/mo) instead.

What do you guys think? Would the 2nd strategy allow me to contribute more towards things like my savings account?",finance,1443654585
