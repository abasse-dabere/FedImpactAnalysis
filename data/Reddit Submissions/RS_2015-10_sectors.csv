personalfinance,Was just approved for my first rewards based credit card,"As a 32 year old guy that once had great credit coming back from bankruptcy, I could have never done this without the help of this subreddit.

After my bankruptcy I said I would never have another credit card again. As I started to look to my future and planning I came to the realization that I had to rebuild my credit to achieve my goals. A little searching landed me in r/personalfinance and a plethora of information.

To any new members or lurkers that may stumble on this, read! Read as much as you can on here. These guys here helped me to better track my spending using apps spreadsheets and online services. I learned that I should have my money working for me even though I have little and opened a savings account with the high interest rate I could find. I learned about secured credit cards(game changer) and I was quickly approved for a low limit one that I seeded. 6 months of paying my phone bill with this card and paying everything else on time and my credit score jumped 100 points.  
I started receiving a lot more pre-screened card offers and honestly just tossed most of them. This week one came in the mail from a bank I have a savings account with and it had no annual fee and rewards so I gave it a try. Approved! This is a huge step for me in rebuilding my credit. 

I have learned so much in a short time and hope so many other are as well. There is still a lot to learn and I'm not stopping. As I continue to work on the basics of my finances, I look forward to the point where I can really start investing and take the next big step.",finance,1443666141

personalfinance,"I'm 25 and have 312k in debt, advice needed.","Hi R/PersonalFinance,

Here's the situation: 312k in student loan debt from pharmacy school with an average interest rate of 6.6%, but got a job right out of school with a large retail chain, expecting income pre-tax to be 120k a year, potentially more but not sure as of yet (first paycheck this Friday!) My cost of living is very low, car paid off, very reasonable living arrangement, cheap hobbies. I have basically zero idea as to finances past that.

I plan to be putting in heavily towards my 401k for retirement (which I assume is a good decision, but could be wrong/missing better options), but mostly I'm fairly concerned about my student loan payments. StudentLoan.gov estimates ~3500 a month for the 10 year repayment plan, and I don't know what plan to go for. That seems like a massive amount. The 25 year repayment plan is lower, but obviously will end up paying more (And I'm unsure if I'm allowed to put extra money towards my loan each month as I'm able, or if I'm stuck to the payment indicated by the plan). The income-based repayment plans (particularly the Pay-As-You-Earn plan, which I think I could qualify for, despite some discussed changes coming up), my monthly payments will be lower, but over the 25 year period, and with the tax on the forgiven amount at the end, I'm not sure if it'd be worth it. The spare amount each month could potentially be reinvested to cover that by the end, I think?

In short, I don't know what plan to go with, don't know what questions to ask, and advice would be great. Links to other posts or resources would also be appreciated!

Edit: Another question, should I look to consolidate and refinance through a third party? I've heard that you lose potential government repayment benefits this way, but is it worth that?

Second edit: Funnily enough, just this morning I got an email informing me I was accepted into the Pay-As-You-Earn plan. This will put my payments at roughly 900 a month. This is much lower than the 3500 a month, but I'll be paying for longer, and will have to pay taxes on the forgiven income at the end. Is it worth it to stick with this plan, and invest the difference (including partially into somewhere I can use to pay off the taxes at the end)?",finance,1443668163
personalfinance,Emergency Fund - The Specifics,"Hi all,

PF has sold me on the importance of an emergency fund, something I didn't even know existed 6 months ago (YNAB can be thrown into that bucket as well) but I have a few questions as to what form this fund can take:

1. This sub does not seem to believe that available credit qualifies as emergency capital. However, I have rarely been in a tight spot where cash was the only option available to me. Is the reasoning here that we want to save up and avoid indeptedness at all costs, and thus interest rates/credit hits?
2. In Canada we have access to TFSA accounts (somewhat similar to RothIRA in terms of the fact that it encourages you to save for retirement), where capital gains, and thus withdraws, are tax free. Also, the amount can be transferred out of the registered account and into a chequings account within 2-3 business days, meaning its fairly liquid. Does this qualify as emergency capital?

I'm asking these questions because I have currently saved up $7000 in chequings, which is about 3.5 months of expenses. I feel as though this is enough. If a situation would arise where more funds are needed, I could simply cover the remainder using my available credit limit, and pay off the debt using my TFSA balance within the same week, thereby avoiding any negative consequences.

I wanted to get everyone's thoughts on this, as I am trying to decide between investing more in my TFSA, or leaving my cash it idle in my chequings for a rainy day (I would probably fund around 4-5 months).

personalfinance,"Girlfriend tried to consolidate her student loans, got screwed.","Hi All,

Looking for some help, and i'm not sure what to do. 

**TL;DR:** my girlfriend tried to consolidate her student loans so that we can pay less per month on bills, however, she got screwed by her own bank.

**LONG STORY:**
We are trying to live by our budget, my girlfriend heard about student loan consolidation through a her bank in her home state because a relative was able to reduce their monthly payment.   My GF is a teacher, and isn't making very much money and she was on a ""reduced"" payment plan of around $380 a month for the **13** loans she has through this one bank. 

She had 6 ""Deal"" loans (not sure what that means) and 7 Federal loans all through the same state bank.  Her bank's website isn't the best, and my gf does all the payments online, so she doesn't keep the paperwork. *sigh*  hence, I don't have a lot of details to go on in terms of figuring this out.  

She applied to have all her loans consolidated, and asks repeatedly (and gets confirmation) that this consolidation includes all the loans.    They tell her that her month payment will go down to $236.   Which we think is a big win.

However, we come to find out, they only consolidated the ""deal"" loans, and left the federal loans.    It's not clear why the other loans were not consolidated (either because she's no longer in state or because they're federal loans.  So, now her payments are now going to be about $550 a month.   This is a obviously not an improvement.    

Throwing into the mix, the 6 ""Deal"" loans (now the 1 consolidated loan) has her mom as a co-signer.  The federal ones, look as if they don't.

Honestly, my GF gets overwhelmed with this stuff while she's on the phone with companies, and with her mom involved, it puts even more stress on her.  So, every time she talks to them, she gets emotional, she never remembers to write down who she talked to or any pertinent details, and due to her bank's hours &amp; location (2 hours behind us), i am never home at the times she's able to call her bank.  So,  obviously, the info I get is second hand from her, after the fact, and through tears of frustration and anger....so, I never know what is what, frankly.  I'm not on these accounts, so I don't think i'd be authorized to discuss this crap with her bank on her behalf, would i?

I've attached a google spread sheet itemizing the loan information.

[Google Docs spreadsheet of loans](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CtAJPFB8Ptmni5p8oOqD3jP66ZdbG5zPwqHU0FJpuNs/edit?usp=sharing)
        

So I have a few questions

1.  I added up all the loans they paid off, and the amount of the new loan ($49,175.05)  is $8,297.05 more than the sum of the 6 previous loans ($40,878).   They have a ""Transaction Fee"" of 1400 or so on top of the 49K to make it 51K, so it doesn't appear to be fees... they just added 8 grand outta nowhere.  Can they do this??
2.  So they stated that she had until 9/1/2015 to cancel this loan.   I wanna know, can we still get of out of this?    
3.   This so obviously to me, seems predatory.
4.   Is there any way that she can add me as having the ability to talk to her?
5.   She's super concerned about her moms cosigned loans, so we obviously will pay those, but can we just not pay the federal loans?   Our credit is already crap.
6.   What other questions am i missing?

I appreciate any time anyone has to look over this and give possible suggestions.

personalfinance,Need advice on whether to move closer to work.,"Hello PF! I'll keep this as brief as possible. 

I'm a recent grad that started working 2 months ago making 40K/year. I have a massive amount of student debt. However, because my job is public interest/government, I'm utilizing the Income Based Repayment plan. My payment isn't bad at all ($250ish/month). I intend to stay in the public interest/government sector for the 10 year period until all my loans are forgiven.

Now, here is the dilemma. I am currently living with my parents until I get my feet underneath me. I commute on a bus to work that takes, on average, about 75 minutes each way. When traffic is bad, it's has taken me significantly longer to get into work. Because I cannot be late, I leave much earlier so I can still arrive on time if there is traffic. 

My day consists of waking up at 4:45, catching the 5:45 bus, and getting to work around 7. I don't need to be there until 8:30 (9 at the absolute latest). I usually leave the office around 6, catch the bus, and get home around 730. I eat, have an hour or two to unwind, and then I go to sleep. And that's on a good day.

My question to this community is this: should I move closer to work or continue saving? The areas around where I work are relatively expensive. It would be difficult (but doable) to find a decent place for 2 people at $1800-2000/month. If I do move, what price range should I be looking for?

Beside federal taxes, I have no other significant expenses. I just feel like I am wasting a lot of hours in my day. If I have forgotten some critical information, I'll update the post. Thanks in advance!",finance,1443696982

Opting out of being a member of the union wouldn't change the deduction because of Fair Share laws (meaning even if I don't want to be a member they still collect the same dues, since I would still benefit from things like the same health insurance premium as a dues-paying member, and I think even representation during a disciplinary hearing). But I think I would get a small percentage of those dues back at the end of the year if I opted out.

financialindependence,"Cash-out refi, or How I Learned to Just Stop Worrying and Love Leverage","Thought I'd share a nuanced situation for those interested in the thoughtful use of leverage. Would love to hear thoughts/experiences from other folks who've been in similar situations.



I own some rental property.  It's increased in value (and rents too) dramatically since I bought it at LTV of about 75%.
Current LTV is about 40-50%.


I'm refinancing it to return to 60% LTV with maximum cash out -- that's the highest LTV I can get with a cash-out at decent rates (avg 4.5%, which is the mean of my two current loans anyway). 

OMG MOAR DEBT!1!


Why am I doing this, and why is it a good idea for some people to keep LTV high through deliberate borrowing?  The decision was an ah-ha moment for me, and I hope it can give some folks a perspective on what possibilities open up when you're FI.


1) I earn too much -- my marginal tax rate is 44% including federal and state taxes.  I anticipate that at retirement (which could be any time between now and ten years from now), I will probably be in a lower bracket -- if I still make $300k when I'm retired, I DEFINITELY retired too late, or I super loved my job.  I barely spend $50k yr for me and my wife, and my RE cashflow pretty much covers that. 


So having additional income now is not really useful.  I'd rather have it later.


2) All that gained equity isn't working for me -- I get the same rents regardless, and my loan payments don't change much one way or another.  After some big rent jumps this year, I'd likely end up paying at least $6k-$10k in extra taxes.


By refinancing I will go from about $825k of mortgage to about $1,125,000.
That's roughly $1500/mo more at 4.5%.
I'm getting to deduct the interest from the operating costs of the business, bringing it closer to zero after all expenses and depreciation.
I can't deduct passive losses because I make too much, but showing no paper profit means less marginal income taxed at 44%.
As rents creep up over time, this will keep me better covered.

Amazingly, I can even re-fi again in four months with no cash out and get even lower rates, if rates hold.

3) What do you do with a sudden $300k?  Well, on the one hand, you can DCA into the markets just like you always do.  You can also buy more rental property, of course, though my local market is somewhat overheated (did I mention I'm pulling $300k out?)...

But it turns out I have a great investment vehicle already -- rental property.  In my area I can add value to the property by adding units, improving structural stability, and so on.
The improvements will yield an add'l 10-15% cash return on equity when complete, and reduce black swan risk re: environment.  Not bad.
I'd have to self-fund this if I didn't take money out, which would mean adding even MORE equity and taxable profit to the property.

Instead, I can refi, use the capital to improve the property, and end up at a sensible LTV with some of the profits from new units shielded from tax.  There is plenty of risk in doing construction work, for sure, but the property market is more overheated than the manual labor market right now.


Bonus:  if the place falls down for uninsurable, calamitous reasons before the improvements are done, *I still have the cash* to try and rebuild, rather than trying to get an equity loan on a property that just experienced a catastrophe.  This is a huge benefit in terms of flexibility.

It turns out the bulk of the value is in the land anyway, which means that my exposure on that front is actually not that high -- I keep the property nice, but the structures themselves have not gotten much more valuable since I've owned them.

Anyway, just food for thought -- hopefully this will be interesting/useful to someone else fence-sitting in a similar too-much-equity-in-a-rental situation.",finance,1443725113

Situation: Lost my job about a month ago. Looking to get a ""get well"" part time job doing electrical work, as I did before college. I have a terrible, maxed out credit card I got when I was younger and knew nothing about finances. I also sell on eBay, making about $400 - $600 a month.

Debts:

Sears Card - $3500 at 24% (Over my credit limit by $500!)

Federal Student loans - 4 loans totalling $11,202 @ 3.86% - On forbearance till 12/13/15 @ applying for 12 months forbearance and IBR

Private school loan - $3500 &amp; 12% -  on forbearance till 12/2015

Living at home so I'm not currently paying for rent, food or utilities.

I did the right thing and paid my past balances on my student loans and requested the forbearances. My main question is what to do with my CC debt. Should I apply for another card, hoping to get a lower rate and a higher credit limit and transfer my balance over from the Sears card? Right now my Sears card is about $500 over the credit limit and my next payment due is the amount over the limit plus fees...

I'm trying to get back on my feet and take control of my life, but I feel overwhelmed and I'm not sure what do to. Any advice is greatly, greatly appreciated.",finance,1443726029
personalfinance,Internship Income Tax Question,"Greetings,

So I just started a part time internship in the beginning of September working  usually 10-12 hours a week making ~13/hr. I just got my first direct deposit for my pay and the amount that was deposited was the full amount without any taxes taken out. 

My question is why was there no taxes withheld? neither federal or state (NJ) nor any of the other taxes like SS and whatever else is usually taken out.

Is it because over the course of the tax year my AGI is too low?
Or could it be that I didn't fill out my W4 correctly?


Thanks",finance,1443726327
personalfinance,"I finally have ""good"" credit.","I've been tracking my credit score every few months for two and a half years.  When I was 18 I no longer had insurance and worked full time as a waitress making $2.13 an hour plus tips and paying for tech school.  I had some medical issues and unfortunately had about $4000 go into collections.  I had no other debt but it tanked my credit.


In March of 2013 I decided to take control of my credit and I've gone from 498 to 700 (Equifax).  TransUnion is at 708.  Obviously I'm not done but I'm so excited to be at a range considered ""good""!


Here's my progression and a little bit about what I did to get there..


3/2013 score 498 - opened a secured card with $300 (Capital One)

8/2013 score 608 - only bought coffee with card, paid every month

3/2014 score 612 - card graduated to ""unsecured"" with $500 limit.  Still didn't qualify for another unsecured card.  Got a secured card with Wells Fargo for $500 (put $200 towards)

10/2014 score 636 - asked Wells Fargo to ""un secure"" card, they did.  Opened an Amazon Card for $1000 unsecured. 

04/2015 score 649 - Balances paid monthly on all three cards.

07/2015 score 665 - Requested a credit limit increase for Wells Fargo from $500 to $1000

10/216 score 700 Yay!



So next on my list as I think three cards are enough for me is getting lower interest rates.  Any other suggestions PF?  Currently that's the only type of ""credit"" I have as I pay for all of my vehicles in cash.",finance,1443726584

investing,The consequences of Fed's Zero Interest Rate Policy and Are we Headed for a Market Slump?,"A lot of people are asking, is the Fed's ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) going to affect us? And is the damage done already too big? Also, is Carl ICahn right about anticipating a broader market slump in the coming months?

I will attempt to answer these questions while avoiding spiraling into a ZeroHedge-Tyler-Durdenesque demagoguery.

&amp;nbsp;

**First, is the Fed's ZIRP having an effect on anything?**

The short answer is yes, and this is only the beginning. Take Glencore for example: the company invested heavily using low-interest bonds, and bought commodites like there was no tomorrow. Glencore somehow managed to pile up $30 billion in debt. Now that commodity prices have slumped, and Glencore cannot finance that debt any longer, the company is in big trouble.
 
http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GLEN:LN

http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/30/444531514/as-commodity-prices-slide-layoffs-and-restructurings-follow

**Takeaway: Companies who used a lot of debt to expand and are dependent on commodities and industrial growth are in a world of pain. This explains why Catapillar, Alcoa, and Glencore, Anglo American are suffering.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Second, is the damage from ZIRP already too big?**

Yes, it seems so. Fed should have started raising interest rates a year ago. If you look at a few charts, you can see there are now bubbles in many sectors:

Student Debt:
http://ftalphaville.ft.com/files/2015/09/US-fed-govt-holdings-of-student-debt.png

Corporate Debt:
https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/NCBDBIQ027S

China and Emerging Markets Debt:

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/these-charts-show-the-big-change-in-chinese-corporate-debt-since-2007

**Takeaway: There are many bubbles that have yet to burst. China's stock market was the first major wake-up call. What will happen when corporations or emerging economies cannot service their debt? We have had some wealth destruction, but there is still a lot more to come. We have seen the effects of wealth destruction as companies have tightened up their advertising budgets, affecting DotComs that are heavily depended on them such as LinkedIn, Yelp, Twitter. Facebook and Google seem to be some of the few that are doing well.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Lastly, is Carl Icahn right about a market slump?**

Yes, at this point a market slump looks unavoidable. Carl Icahn doesn't have a perfect track record calling market crashed, but he is right about a global slowdown right now. He called this recent correction, even when we were near the market peak back in June:

http://www.profitconfidential.com/news/stock-market-crash-you-wont-believe-what-carl-icahn-just-said/

Lets take a closer look at why he could be right. This is one of my favorite charts, the weekly intermodal rail traffic. The rail traffic is higher when companies are buying inventory, signaling a healthy economy. When the traffic slows down, it's an indicator of trouble ahead.

http://ycharts.com/indicators/us_intermodal_units_weekly_rail_traffic

It's hard to see because of the cyclical nature of the chart, but this September we had the biggest drops in rail traffic since the last recession, and this week's recovery numbers are weaker than they have been since 2008. 

Moreover, the BRIC countries are all slumping, Europe's feeble recovery is slowing down, and countries with commodity-based economies (Canada and Australia) are hurting. I look at Canada and Australia as a barometer of global growth, since both countries have huge cache of natural resources. Better global growth = higher need for resources.

http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2a6c3d6a-0f62-11e5-897e-00144feabdc0.html

Furthermore, the Saudi government shares this pessimism in global equities. They have been liquidating their assets at a very high rate.

**Takeaway for LONG-TERM INVESTORS: Don't despair, if you are a long-term investor, ignore the volatility. Buffet is not worried about the daily and weekly swings in the market, and neither should you be. Volatility does not affect a good asset's value in the long term. This may be a good time to snap up some stocks for the long term, even Carl Icahn has been adding some energy companies to his portfolio. Besides energy, there are some battered stocks that are now good values, Stores, Lulu-lemon, Micron to name a few.**

**Takeaway for TRADERS: Expect Volatility to remain elevated, regardless of market action, exploit this distortion in Implied Volatility (IV) using options. What I mean is that  IV is high for puts relative to calls, near term IV is higher vs further dated IV, causing an inverted structure. Types of trades that can work: Selling OTM puts, or put spreads and owning calls; Sell near-term IV, buy further-dated IV options.**

personalfinance,"(CAN) Financial ruin barely averted, what to do now?","I've head the FAQ/Wiki as best I can but i still apologise in advance if I did anything wrong. I don't know jack about finances.

My situation:  I live in Ontario. Graduated in April with ~40k in debt. Minimum payment for my loans is ~450/month, starting November 1st. All this time I've been unemployed desperately looking for a job using my degree, and now just ANYTHING. I managed to land a full time, minimum wage job just now, starting tomorrow, although they can only guarantee full-time until around January.

So, I plugged in my minimum wage (11.25/hr) at 40 hours/week for 50/52 weeks a year into a calculator for take home pay in Ontario, and it spit out a take-home monthly income of $1,579.  My bank account is nearly drained, with only about $ 500 remaining. 

My budget right now I've planned to be is:

$457/month for rent (includes all utils, internet, everything I'd need)
$60/month phone (varies by about $5/month)
~450/month for payment
~200/month for food and ""Keep me from going insane"" fund.

My questions ARE:

1. Is 200/month a reasonable amount allotted to food/fun? Too much?
 and more importantly
2. What do I DO with the remainder? Do I work on building that 6 month emergency fund or do I put it all into the loan to get rid of it ASAP? According to loan payment calculators on the government site, the interest rate is 3.5%.

personalfinance,Will I owe taxes or be owed a tax refund for 2015 on these facts?,"I posted a similar question the other day and got some really useful help, but now that I have some exact figures I wanted to post one last time to check that I have properly understood everything.  Thank you so much in advance for any responses - I really appreciate it.

I am trying to figure out whether I will owe taxes or be owed a tax refund for 2015.  Based on my calculations (using the info I got when I posted my last question) I figure I should end up owing a couple hundred dollars or so.  Based on the below facts, does that sound about right?

Here are the relevant facts and figures:

- State: California.

- Single person, no kids, rented housing... usually I do my taxes on TurboTax and I only qualify for the normal standard deductions, nothing special.

- Lived and worked in California from Jan 1st 2015 - April 30th 2015 

- Left the country on April 30th 2015 and will not return to the U.S. within 2015.

- I am a non-U.S citizen and had medical insurance all the time I was in the U.S. (so no penalty for not being insured).

- Did not / will not work the remainder of 2015. 

- No additional income from other sources during 2015 other than that listed below.

WAGES:

My total wages earnings for 2015 (earned during the period I worked in the U.S.) will be $25,933.04 GROSS, $24,645.04 FIT TAXABLE ... My total taxes already paid on wages (automatically taken from my paychecks) was $5,591.17 ($4,234.19 Federal Income Tax and $1,356.98 Pri-State Tax).   

(I assume that the other taxes I paid automatically from my paychecks, i.e. So Sec Tax, Medicare Tax, and SDI/UC Tax, are irrelevant to these calculations?  If I mistaken, my payments of those taxes for 2015 were $1,482.47 on So Sec Tax, $346.71 on Medicare Tax, $214.91 on SDI/UC Tax.)

CASHED OUT 401K: 

I cashed out my 401K containing $30,116.22 and received $23,450.82 in cash, paid a $40.00 fee to the bank the plan was with, with the remaining $6,625.40 being held back by the bank for taxes ($6,023.09 for federal and $602.31 for state).

My understanding is that I will owe a federal penalty (10%) and a California state penalty (2.5%) for cashing out my 401k early, which in my case would mean $3,011.62 for federal and $752.91 for state.  

So, based on the above, I figure I will owe a couple hundred dollars for 2015.  Does that sound about right?

I'm a stupid college student who got into a bit of a debt hole. It's not as bad as many others, but due to unemployment and bad decision-making was threatening to force me back into my mom's basement and derail my life. Right now I have an opportunity to crawl out of it however, and I want to do it right. 

Overview of my situation:

* $10,000 in federal student loans ($2000 unsubsidized)

* $16,000 total in a credit card and line of credit from my bank

* No savings, nothing in checking

* I'm still in school, but got a full-time offer from a company who will work with my part-time class load. 

* I need a car to get to work/school

* My car is a beater I've already poured too much money into repairing. 20 MPG on a good day. I suspect it'll just stop driving one of these days.

After reading some of the stuff in the sidebar, I sketched out a simple monthly budget. After rent/food/necessary expenses I'm leaving myself a few hundred dollars per month for miscellaneous recreation (consistent with my past spending habits), and the rest is split into paying off debt (75%) and building an emergency fund (25%). 

My questions are the following: 

* How do I determine which cars are ""within my budget"" as a function of my income, credit score, and/or timetable for paying off debt?

* Right now I really want to prioritize debt over an emergency fund, but the sidebar advises the opposite. Why? Can you convince me to change my mind?

* How can I best psychologically force myself to follow the budget I set up? I worry that inbetween payday and automatic payments I'll see dollar signs and buy something shiny. That kind of attitude helped to get me into this situation to begin with.

* Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Any tips about things I might not be considering?",finance,1443739998

personalfinance,"Need help tracking down information about two old Federal student loans, which I'm not sure even exist.","After growing up a lot in the last year, and spending 2 years at my current job which heavily involves finance and credit, I've taken almost all of my debt on as my own responsibility. 

My problem is, and I'm embarrassed to say so, I did not have anything to do with my finances through college.  I was a late bloomer, as far as financial responsibility goes.  It was a perfect storm, because my dad is the kind of matriarch who wants control of *everything* including mine and my brothers' finances... his method was to keep everyone else in the dark, and when someone would ask (even firmly, in a put-my-foot-down way) about it he'd say ""*You boys aren't settled into your career yet, don't worry about the bills.*  

One of my biggest regrets is him consolidating some of mine and my brother's loans into his HELOC.  Maybe the interest rates were more favorable, but it removed the rest of us from our ""right"" (haha) to our own debt.  He only told us after it had been done.  The reason I hate he did it is because how the fuck am I supposed to pay my share when 1. I don't know what it is.  How much of that monthly payment is towards *my* portion of the principal, and its debt?  2.  I can't actually pay it myself, but instead would have to give the money to him.  He is HORRIBLE with money.  But read the previous paragraph to see why he likes this method better. 

I still get reminded of it a lot.  Although I'd *like* to help (after I know it would be worth my investment, and he wouldn't waste my $), more importantly, I'm more concerned about some other red flags.  Because I'm thinking the amount of my debt wrapped into that equity loan is HUGELY lower than what he's telling me it is.  Same with my brother's.  If so, then there is an also HUGE amount of debt unaccounted for.  This is why I need to know how much my federal loan balances were, when paid off.  

**He is telling me that I had $68,000 in federal loans paid off.  My credit report shows otherwise... two WELLS FARGO loans closing at the same time as his HELOC opened, but with a combined balance of $38,000.**  Do federal loans disappear from credit reports earlier than other accounts? It would have been September '13 when they were closed.  But there are no Fed student loan accounts *at all,* closed or open.  I have two more outstanding WF loans that I still pay, but that's it.

Everything I've found says to go to the NSLDS website.  But to me it looks like the those records are only for federal student aid, and not loans. And my account only shows a single small FASFA grant.

So where do I go to find more information on my federal loans, if there were any?

personalfinance,Running into dead ends with debt consolidation. Do I have any other options?,"I'll try to keep this short, but I can provide more details if they're relevant.

My wife and I have a lot of debt. We spend just about 1/3 of our collective monthly income on minimum payments to student loans and credit cards. The situation feels untenable, and I feel like I've exhausted my options.

I have both federal and private student loans. I have my federal loans in income based repayment, which reduces my payments to $0. This isn't an option for my private loans, however. I have tried to refinance my private student loans with the current holder (Wells Fargo) but I couldn't get anything approved. They wanted a cosigner, but all the cosigners that I had apply didn't qualify (including the cosigner of the current loan). 

I tried opening an joint account with my wife at a credit union and getting a credit card consolidation loan through them, thinking the interest rate would be lower. Or at least, it could put multiple cards into one payment, and at least reduce the monthly payment. The person on the phone said that the best way to do that would be to just open a new credit card with them, and use it to pay off the others. So I did a joint credit application with me and my wife on the application. The credit application was denied, for the mostly-obvious debt-to-income ratio reasons. I just got off the phone with them and they said that the underwriters, when looking at approving the loan, also looked at approving a smaller amount, but I just don't qualify for anything. He also said that the credit card is generally the easier thing to qualify for, so he didn't think there was anything else worth applying for.

Both my wife and I have credit scores in the low 700s. We've always made all of our payments. Nothing is past due. Is there anything else worth trying, as far as lowering my monthly payments on any of these loans goes? I'm under the impression that if I don't qualify for what I've applied for, then I won't qualify for anything. Is there something I'm not thinking of? What about these debt consolidation services that I get spam in the mail for? Are those ever worth anything?

The worst part about learning about stocks is the jargon. They purposely hide behind confusing, esoteric terms which noone except other financial industry experts understand. 

I personally am investing in only mutual funds and ETFs so take that into consideration because even though I'm going to try not to be biased, I may be unknowingly biased. I'm going to try to dig as much dirt as possible to counter this though so keep that in mind too. 

Although retirement accounts use the same investment vehicles, they are on a completely different level legally and financially. For example, the tax implications from capital gains distributions are deferred in retirement accounts. 

Broad Terms:

**Mutual Funds:** 

http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/introduction-mutual-funds/

Basically you're signing up with an individual investment banker's strategy. You buy into an actively managed mutual fund = an investment banker manages your money and tries to ""make you as much money as he can."" 

-Index Funds-
Are mutual funds which track a particular ""index"" or collection of stocks. So, for example, Dow Jones Industrial or S&amp;P 500. These are ""passively managed"" by a computer and thus, should have lower expense ratios. 

But money managers tend to say that this is like ""giving up"" because you're just following the trend of the market as a whole and not using your brain to find the tricks. 

**Advantages of actively managed mutual funds:** You actually have a human being managing your money so technically they could take advantage of any news they hear like during the .com boom in the 90s. 

**Advantages of ""passively managed"" index funds:** They are computerized. Historically have outperformed most actively managed funds.  

**What to watch for: Expenses. Hidden Expenses etc.**

**1. Expense Ratio:** A set % deducted each year from your total balance. Supposed to be how the money manager makes his money. This is his salary.  DO NOT invest in a fund because it has high expense ratios. There is no correlation between pricier = better in this instance. The lower the expense ratio the better and never invest in any fund that approaches 1%. 

**2. Loads/commissions:** ""Fees for salesperson"" Don't invest in any mutual funds with a load. 

**a. Front-End.** Pay a fee to get into the club. ex. 5% to get in. 

**b. Back-End.** Pay a fee to exit the club. Can be fixed or complicated. Like 5% if you withdraw your money tomorrow, 4% the day after tomorrow, 3%...2%...1%. They say not to invest in any mutual funds with a load. 

**3. 12B-1 fees.** Don't buy any with this fee. This expense is an advertising fee so you pay for the fund's advertising costs. 

**4. Hidden ""transactional"" costs:** This is the most unimportant fee, but ""excessive"" transactions will eat into gains. 
This fee is how much it costs the money manager of the fund to buy and sell shares. There is no law requiring these costs to be disclosed. However, the law requires ""turnover ratios"" to be published. This can give a rough estimate of how many times transactions have moved around in the fund. The average turnover ratio in a fund is 130% according to morningstar. You should read this article in it's entirety because for me, turnover ratio is the least important because no GOOD money manager is randomly buying and selling stocks everyday racking up transactional costs.

http://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/09/mutual-fund-turnover-rate.asp

**5. NAV = Net Asset Value:** NAV is calculated everyday. It's basically a calculation of what the mutual fund is worth everyday after all the gains and losses of the different stocks and fees are taken out. This is more important for the other investment vehicles below because a mutual fund's share price = NAV so NAV doesn't matter for mutual funds. But for ETFs, the NAV can be higher or lower than ONE SHARE of the ETF so it may indicate if it is overpriced or underpriced. 

**6. Capital Gains Distributions:** When the fund manager decides to cash out a particular stock, you are on the hook for your share of the taxes. It's not as bad as it sounds but can be bad because you owe taxes through no action of your own. Basically if I own my own shares with no dividends and I don't touch them for 10 years I don't owe any taxes on anything. However, because the fund manager sold the shares, you owe taxes out of nowhere is basically what I'm trying to say. 

For example, let's say XYZ Mutual Fund purchased 100,000 shares of a stock 20 years ago for $1. The fund sells the 100,000 shares today for $50, which results in a long-term capital gain of $49 per share. The fund must distribute a lawfully mandated minimum of 90% (""hey it costs money to print the checks"") the gains to current shareholders and the shareholders must report the gain on their tax return.

While it might seem like a positive to receive a capital gains distribution, there is actually no positive economic value to the distribution.

For instance, looking further at the XYZ Mutual Fund distribution:

You own 1,000 shares of the XYZ Mutual Fund. The fund has a net asset value (NAV) of $10 per share. Your investment in the fund equals $10,000.

The total value of your holding in the fund is $10,000 (1,000 shares at $10 per share).

The fund distributes long-term capital gains as described in the previous example. The long-term capital gain upon the sale of stock in the previous example is 10% of the fund’s total net asset value or $1 per share.

Shareholders of record on the record date will receive $1 for each share they own and the NAV of the fund will be reduced by $1 on the ex-dividend date.

As a result, you receive $1,000, you can then reinvest in the fund.
Assuming no change in the market value, you still own $10,000 of the fund. However, if you reinvest, you can gain shares in the fund and hope that the fund goes up from there. However, you still owe capital gains tax.

The fund’s NAV was reduced to $9 by the capital gains distribution of $1 and you reinvested the gain to give you a total of 1,111.11 shares ($1,000 reinvested in at the new NAV of $9 buys 111.11 shares). 

If you did not reinvest the gain, you would have 1,000 shares at $9 and $1,000 cash and you owe capital gains tax. 

Either way, you have $10,000 - capital gains tax. This isn't worth it if you just invested or you invested and the share price went down. 

For example, if your $10,000 investment hasn't gained or lost value and you find out the fund anticipates making a long-term capital gains distribution of 15 cents per share, you may be better off selling the fund before the record date. If you have 1,000 shares, your distribution would be $150. If you’re in the 25 percent federal income tax bracket or higher, you’d owe more than $22 in federal taxes. Any other taxable distributions—including short-term capital gains— are considered ordinary income and taxed that way with one exception: qualified dividends. See below for more on tax rates for dividend income.

Fortunately, capital gains and dividend income distributions aren’t state secrets. You can find out when fund companies plan distributions—and projected amounts—by checking their websites starting in mid-November. Your financial adviser can help determine the right time to buy or sell a fund without creating a tax hit. It’s important that your adviser also help you research and identify replacement funds that fit your investment plan if you sell.

The tax rates you pay on distributions depend on how long a fund owns the stocks or bonds that generated the gains. If a fund has held an investment a year or more, the gain is taxed at the capital gains tax rate and identified as a long-term gain on your 1099 form. Distributions of anything considered ordinary income—non-qualified dividends and income and gains from anything held less than a year—are taxed as ordinary income and reported as dividend income. Qualified dividends are taxed at your capital gains rate. And you're taxed on distributions whether you receive them in cash or use them to buy additional shares.

Not every fund distributes gains each year, and not all distributions are significant enough that you’d make a decision to buy or sell based on the amount. But it’s important you know about capital gains and dividend income distributions. A fund may make them even after a stretch where it has underperformed. If distributions are substantial enough in that instance, you might consider tax-loss harvesting.

**Why you should invest in mutual funds:**

1. No transaction costs if you invest in a load free and 12B-1 free fund. So you put money in and that amount goes in. Good for multiple transactions like paycheck deductions because you don't have to pay fees everytime you touch your money. You will still get charged the other fees. 

2. Can be automatically bought from paycheck deductions.

personalfinance,Graduate School Abroad On An Extremely Tight Budget (Help? Advice?) (x-post: /r/StudentLoans),"Hi /r/PersonalFinance,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to direct this question, but I thought I'd reach out to you for some advice. Here goes:

I am considering getting a graduate degree abroad.

The benefits of the program are:

* Short duration (I'd rather get a degree in 9 - 15 months, instead of 2 - 3 years)
* Language immersion
* International experience (which is really important to me) 
* Reasonable tuition (~$18,000 total)
* Useful degree that will hopefully help me have more diverse professional options, as well as a higher income (again, *hopefully*).

Cons:

* I would be unemployed for the duration of the program, as it's nearly impossible to get a work visa.
* Living expenses (~$850/month)
* I have ~$20k in undergraduate student loan debt

---

Another MAJOR wrench -- I live in a relatively inexpensive apartment in an extremely expensive city.

* Rent where I live now: $800
* Rent abroad: $450
* Total: $1,250 
* Average rent: $1,300 - $1,600

I don't have the right to sublet my place technically (it's something I'd have to negotiate), but assuming I *can't* sublet, I would have to pay rent in two places for the year.

$1,250 is a lot (especially when I would be unemployed), but it's still below average rent in the city I live in currently. It would be much more expensive in the short term, sure. But well worth it in the long term, I think, given that my rent is well below market value. Leaving my current place would mean I'd need less money for graduate school in the short term, but coming back to an apartment at market value could mean I pay $5k - $8k more in rent/year. Not worth it in the long term, in my opinion.

So if we went with the **WORST case scenario** --

* Rent in the U.S.: $10k per year
* Rent abroad: $5,400 per year
* Remaining living expenses abroad: $4,800 per year
* Tuition: $18k for the year

**Total: $38,000**

(Those are approximations)

Lets assume there are lots of clerical things and a plane ticket I need to buy, too. So, $40,000 for a graduate degree isn't completely unheard of, but oh my gosh! that's so much when one of my main motivations for studying abroad was cheaper tuition. (And again, my current debt is $20k. I don't want to triple it overnight!)

That's the worst case scenario, more or less.

---

**The *slightly* better case scenario** allows me to sublet my apartment, which would shave about $10,000 off that total. Additionally, if I am accepted, I can apply for a scholarship. And -- again I know there are a lot of *ifs* here -- *if* I was approved for the scholarship, I could have the tuition reduced 25% - 50% (maybe more if I can demonstrate financial need).

So, from $40,000 we subtract $10,000 (domestic rent) and $4,500 - $9,000 in scholarship money (again -- these are contingent on lots of things going right), **a better case scenario costs me $21,000 - $25,500**. Still a lot, but perhaps starting to feel better about having an international graduate education experience that isn't much more expensive than my undergraduate experience.

The good news is that I could probably work my ass off and save up a lot of money in a year. I'm not above being a cheap ass, being super frugal, and cutting out the excess (we all know that's what it will take to be an unemployed graduate student anyway; why not practice now?). Even if I saved intensively, though, I don't envision being able to save the entire $20k, much less $40k. I'd like to save aggressively, then take out loans to cover whatever I can't save.

And the final wrench, which you'll appreciate so much: The program doesn't qualify for US Department of Education loans (it's not on the list of approved international programs).

---

**So, reddit. I need your help (desperately). Here are my questions:**

1. Is it worth it to hold onto hope or should I just give up my dream of earning my Master's degree abroad? Does this seem like a decent idea? Or is it too risky to take the chance?

2. Do you see any blind spots in my thinking/logic about this stuff? I admit I'm not the most financially savvy person in the world. But I don't think I'm completely reckless, either.

3. Do you know of any loan resources that have fair, low interest rates and payback terms, like the Department of Education, but that would allow me to apply them to a program abroad?

4. Any creative suggestions for alternative sources of funding? I see $40k as this terrifying figure looming over my dream. But I feel motivated to slice into it and bleed it down to an affordable number by any means necessary: applying for scholarships, starting a kickstarter, begging on Facebook, or writing to Oprah if I have to!

I really appreciate your help and hope to find a glimmer of hope in what, right now, feels like a mass of intimidating storm clouds. I thank you in advance for your advice and suggestions.

Thanks, everyone!

personalfinance,Recently got a pay raise- Is it normal for my federal W/H to increase ~37%,"Hey all!

I recently got a promotion and a pay raise, to the tune of $9,300.00 dollars 56.7k&gt;66k Yay! Right?

My gross bi-weekly pay went from 2180.77 to 2538.47.  An increase of $357.70 per paycheck, and yet my net pay only went up 175.33.  From 1405.23 to 1580.56.  Now I get where some of that money is going, various taxes are increasing such as SS/Medicare and my 401k which are based on fixed percentages.  I also know that I still have my static monthly costs on insurance.

However, the one area that doesn't seem right to me is the Federal W/H.  It went up from 208.68  to 286.73.  I certainly expected an increase (especially if the new pay pushes me into a higher tax bracket), but I didn't think it would be that much more.  I've read that the increased tax amount from a higher tax bracket will only effect the income over that amount?  So as I understood it if you were taxed at 20% up to 50k, and then it went to 25% at 60k; you would only be taxed the 25% on the 10k from 50-60? Or am I understanding it wrong.  

It seems bizarre that the federal W/H went from 11.1% of my taxable income (Gross-Deductions), to 13.1%.  I've even just checked, and it says the 2015 Tax Brackets are 25% for 37,450 to 90,750$.  So shouldn't this have stayed the same based on %?

personalfinance,Need to buy a car but have high interest debt. Advice needed!,"Hello!

Using a throw-away since I don’t want my main username tied to my financial situation.
Here’s my situation:

I have a great new job paying $85,000/year but I have a bunch of debt and I need to buy a car in order to get to work. Here are the numbers.

**Debt:**

$7,000 @ 7% interest (Loan from mom)

$8300 @ 18% interest (3 credit cards) 

$4000 @ 0% interest until March 2016, then 18% ($134/month payment)

$27,000 @ 6.8% interest ($225/month) – Student Loans

$4500 @ 6.8% interest rate ($112/month) – Student Loans

I live in San Francisco. My monthly rent is $1200, but it includes food, since I live in a co-op. I can bring my lunch to work every day, and I will almost never eat out at restaurants. 

Let’s assume my spending on entertainment is $50/week.
 
Right now I’m renting a car to get to work (on average) is $25/day + $15 in gas. (I drive 90 miles/day for work). Renting a car is a terrible way to spend money, so I want to buy a car as soon as possible.

It’s really stressful to have this much debt, but with my new job and frugal spending habits, I’m optimistic that I’ll be able to pay off my debt rapidly. I’m generally good with finances, but I’ve never even considered getting a car loan. I’ve always owned old cars.

Since I’m driving so many miles each day, I want to buy a car that gets good gas mileage. I also don’t want to buy something that will break down, since I won’t be able to afford repairs. I’m thinking a 2007 Prius, or an older Honda Accord or something similar. I hope to spend between $4000 - $8000 on a car that gets me 25-40 mpg and has 80,000 – 120,000 miles on it.

2-3 days per week I should be able to car pool with a co-worker, but I can’t rely on that since we work different hours. Public transit isn’t an option for me.

I’ve looked at getting a loan from lending club (8% or so) and using that to buy a car outright. Another option would be to get an auto loan, which I think would be 10% interest, which would suck. I think my credit score is 670 if that’s helpful to anyone.

Every paycheck (bi-weekly)  I would be receiving $2,098.53 (take home pay). My benefits will kick in the moment I start working or my first day of work. I have $33,000 in student loan


$500 - rent (all utilities included)

$150 - groceries

$113.88 - car insurance

$160 - fuel

$500 - student loan (min. payment is $250)

Car paid off (recently paid $1,700 for maintenance - new all brakes, new all tires, new shocks, oil change, new battery)

Total: $1,423.88

Money left: $2,773.18


OPTION 1

Is it wise to pay $2,700 a month towards my student loan even though the payments is deferred? So that way I can 1) pay off the loan faster (in 1 yr) and 2) If I miss a payment, it is technically not a missed payment because it is deferred.


That is the best case scenario, but I would have to go down to $2,200 because I would like to take care of my sister's car payment ($312) and phone bill ($180; 5 lines). Either way, I would project to complete my loan in less than a year. ($2,200/month + tax return money + what I saved up so far).


OPTION 2

Do you think it would be better to save up and not pay the student loan for the length of the deferment (1 year), and by the end of my deferment I could pay it off, while in the meantime giving me the flexibility to take care of any unexpected cost from the saving ($2,200/month) I am building up.

MY STUDENT LOAN:

DIRECT UNSUB GRACE $7,000.00 4.66%

DIRECT UNSUB GRACE $6,000.00 3.86%

DIRECT SUB GRACE $5,500.00 3.40%

DIRECT SUB GRACE $3,500.00 3.86%

DIRECT SUB GRACE $2,000.00 3.86%

DIRECT UNSUB GRACE $1,000.00 3.86%

Current Accrued Interest is $980.17

Obviously my first plan of action is to tackle the highest interest rate, which is $7,000, but I don't feel comfortable using my $6,500 saving because of unexpected overhead down the road.

personalfinance,Should my dad surrender his endowment? [UK],"The endownment matures in 54 months for a value of 45000 GBP. The current surrender value is just over 31000. Apparently it's on track to meet the target, but I don't know how much that means. There other 2 endowments they had came under around 33% in 2010 and last month. 

He currently pays 180 GBP per month, that that will be 180*54 =~ 10k. His current mortgage rate is 2.5% APR, and is expected to rise over the coming years.

I figured to work out the cash value of the endowment, I could do 45000 discounted by 2.5 APR over 4.5 years (so 0.206% each 54 months assuming interest rates stay the same). That brings the present value of the endownment to 40267 for interest on mortgage. I then knocked off the 180*54 (monthly contributions to the plan), which brings the present value of the endowment to just over 30k -slightly less of the cash in value.

 If my calculations are correct (and please do verify), then they should sell the endowment now (note this is a slightly conservative estimate as interest rates are likely to increase). Do you agree? Should I discount the future value of the endowment by the interest rate on the mortgage

I think they missed there chance to get compensation a few years back on there other endownments. I think they would qualify under being missold (I recall them mentioning when I was younger that they expected large parts of the mortgage to get paid off this way).

You are receiving this e-mail because you may have used LinkedIn's Add Connections feature between September 17, 2011 and October 31, 2014.

A federal court authorized this Notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer.

Why did I get this notice? This Notice relates to a proposed settlement (""Settlement"") of a class action lawsuit (""Action"") against LinkedIn Corporation (""LinkedIn"") based on LinkedIn's alleged improper use of a service called ""Add Connections"" to grow its member base.

What is the Action about? The Action challenges LinkedIn's use of a service called Add Connections to grow its member base. Add Connections allows LinkedIn members to import contacts from their external email accounts and email connection invitations to one or more of those contacts inviting them to connect on LinkedIn. If a connection invitation is not accepted within a certain period of time, up to two ""reminder emails"" are sent reminding the recipient that the connection invitation is pending. The Court found that members consented to importing their contacts and sending the connection invitation, but did not find that members consented to LinkedIn sending the two reminder emails. The Plaintiffs contend that LinkedIn members did not consent to the use of their names and likenesses in those reminder emails. LinkedIn denies these allegations and any and all wrongdoing or liability. No court or other entity has made a judgment or other determination of any liability.

What relief does the Settlement provide? LinkedIn has revised disclosures, clarifying that up to two reminders are sent for each connection invitation so members can make fully-informed decisions before sending a connection invitation. In addition, by the end of 2015, LinkedIn will implement new functionality allowing members to stop reminders from being sent by canceling the connection invitation. LinkedIn has also agreed to pay $13 million into a fund that can be used, in part, to make payments to members of the Settlement Class who file approved claims. Attorneys representing the Settlement Class will petition the Court for payment of the following from the fund: (1) reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs up to a maximum of $3,250,000, and (2) service awards for the Plaintiffs up to a maximum of $1,500 each. The payment amount for members of the Settlement Class who file approved claims will be calculated on a pro rata basis, which means that it will depend on the total number of approved claims. If the number of approved claims results in a payment amount of less than $10, LinkedIn will pay an additional amount up to $750,000 into the fund.

personalfinance,"Citizens Bank $9.99 ""service fee""","So about a year ago I signed up with Citizens Bank because they had a $100 bonus if you created a checking account with them and set up direct deposit. 

For some reason I did not get the note that they charge a $9.99 service fee every month there is NOT a direct deposit. for some reason i remember them telling me they will charge for a savings account (which is why i opted out of signing up for that one), but i have no memory of that $10 charge being part of the deal. 

anyways, being a student and away for breaks, I got about $50 in ""service fees"" since I opened my account. I should've noticed the fees earlier but it is not my main account and I've only started getting very serious about my finances recently so I never looked closely. 

I am pretty miffed and want to close my account ASAP next monday. however I really want to get those fees removed before that -- but those service charges happened as early as Jan (when I was away for winter break) and as late as Sept (again summer break).

personalfinance,"[Update] Loans, Savings, and Forgiveness?","Hey personal financiers, Frankie checking in.  You guys probably don't remember me, but [I posted a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2bybwi/questions_school_debt_budgeting_and_general/) outlining my situation and got some good advice from many of you here.

I just wanted to post an update - and before you ask, no I'm not out of debt yet.  I don't have a glory story about moving in with my parents for a few months to save on rent/utilities or getting a raise and all of the sudden earning $80k. 

I got a new job, but I'm still on the low end of the income spectrum, but I'm much happier where I am.

Debt Remaining: $20,607.65
Interest rate: 3.18%

So compared to last year, I have paid off $13,555.76.  I suppose that's pretty good?

At this point in my debt payoff, I've already paid back what I owed, plus about $12,000 interest.

On top of that, my wife and I have still found ways to save a little bit of money.  We don't have an IRA yet, but that will be coming as soon as I'm out of this hole.

I recently went through a job transition, which came with a whole bunch of new expenses and a big move.  So my budget has completely changed and I'm a bit worried that we are going to struggle more than we normally do.

So I work for a 403(b) institution - I have since I graduated college in 2007.

Question for those more learned than me - how would I find out if I qualify for debt forgiveness?

Because at this point, I'm not sure if it's worth it to push through and try to pay off my loans in the next two years, or if I should go to IBR and wait for debt forgiveness.

What do you all think?  Have I done ok in paying things off since last year?  Should I go for IBR and Debt Forgiveness?  What are my next steps?",finance,1443825707

personalfinance,100k undergrad debt. Went to financial planner - still anxious.,"Like title says, I have 100k in debt from my undergrad degree, 70k private and ~30k federal, highest private interest rate 7.5%. I already beat myself up enough over it. My parents have said they will take on half, leaving me with $50k but I don't want to assume they will. I want to go to school to be a NP or PA. Either will cost another ~80-100k. Starting salaries for this profession are around 85k. 

I went to my parents financial planner today and she made it seem like it was no big deal that I had these loans. She said that she was expecting much worse and that I am in a decent position and that after grad school I should be comfortable financially. However I am not so sure, especially after reading this subreddit. My parents trust her a lot and she has made them a substantial amount of money in the past three years they have worked with her. I asked about paying down some debt in the gap year before grad school and she said she would rather see me put that money into a savings account to build up my emergency fund for grad school.

gaming,"With FO:4 coming out, I decided to finally finish FO:NV. I think the devs missed a serious opportunity to do more with Benny.","[This ain't forgiveness, it's something... wrong.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/27HeeejpxTo/maxresdefault.jpg)

Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking already. *""Benny!? That douche!?""* And to some degree, you're right. He's the character we love killing. The game opens with him **shooting you in the head**. Following that, we're presented with a multitude of choices in how we want to handle our next encounter with Benny... but all of them end with him trying to fuck us over. Which is exactly why we enjoy killing him. Hell, with the way the game developers presented the game, *I* loved killing him. I mean, c'mon... yes, he's cool, he's charming as fuck, but as far as we're concerned... he's dead meat precisely because he can't be trusted. In my game I played the ""reserved but good-hearted"" type, at least for this play-through - I do favors for the little folks, but when I made the evaluation that it was better for the world if somebody ended up on the other side of the dirt... well, they went there with style.

So, I told Benny I forgave him. And when he went running for the door, I capped him in the back of the head.

Ice cold.

But, you see, I got the strangest feeling when that happened that that's *exactly* what Benny would have done. That's what made it so satisfying, and it's also what made it more of a compliment to Benny than an insult, even though I was obviously fucking him over. Benny played to win. No holdsies, game on. And so that was, in addition to my final *Fuck You, Buddy* to Benny, also my nod of respect to him. If he deserved to die to anybody, it was somebody *that* cold.

But that really got me thinking, you know - what exactly *was* Benny's grand plan? What kind of guy was he, really? We know he was cool - I guess that's a matter of opinion, but to me, I think he had [a pretty fucking cool backstory](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Benny). He went forward to the future from his tribal roots without mercy, and he rebuilt his tribe into something great. More than that, he impressed House as being a capable enough individual to be selected as his protege. I think we can probably safely say that House is a pretty fucking picky individual. 

Benny, on the other hand, was actually smarter than House - at least when it came to subterfuge. House underestimated Benny - saw him as a dumb tribal at his core, smarter than the average yokel but certainly not smart or ambitious enough to challenge *him*, goodness no. Benny, though, knew opportunity when it came knocking at his door - and he didn't just know it, he *worked* for it. I was fucking impressed when I saw what Benny had done with Yes Man, with the tunnels, with figuring out the chip and even having a pretty goddamn solid plan for usurping House and taking his place. We're not talking about the way our character gets everything handed to him/her - and let's face it, they do. The Courier is the Mary Sue of the Fallout universe. We get all of this amazing power just given to us like some kind of Christmas bonanza, but Benny plotted. He waited. He was careful, he played the game *well*. And yes, he *did* have to crack a few eggs, aight, babe? But you know, here's the thing... I really ended up wondering: what was Benny's vision? What made the eggs worth cracking? Just a bit of power? He had that. Just livin' the good life? He had that, too. Nah, I think Benny had *some* kind of vision. Something made him *hungry* to keep going. We know from his underlings that Benny spent *months* alone working on the whole Yes Man dealio.

What did this guy want so badly that he was willing to risk the wrath of *House* for it? Was he just power hungry? Maybe. But somehow... I think not. He took the reins of The Chairmen through a *knife fight*, and he did it because he believed in moving into the future. That was a choice that impacted the entire tribe, not just him. And he made the right choice - obviously, if we take a look at how The Chairmen are doing as opposed to, say, the Fiends or even the Great Khans. Benny was smart, he was a thinker, and although he fucked the Courier over, he had no reason not to. The Courier was just some chump who wasn't part of his tribe. I don't even think Swank, who was happy enough to take Benny's place (makes sense - Benny wouldn't choose somebody for *his* right hand man who didn't at least have the balls to be ambitious) disliked Benny; just look what the Fallout wiki has to say: ""If the Courier opts to kill Benny in Ring-a-Ding-Ding!, Swank can later be heard ""consoling mourners"" in an interview with Radio New Vegas by saying, ""If I know my pal Benny he's swinging with the big cat upstairs as we speak, or chasing some angel broad with cans as big as her halo"". However, if the player has shown evidence to Swank that Benny attempted to kill the Courier, he will state in conversation he 'guesses he's the boss now'. He, along with everyone else in The Tops, will mention how he 'thought Benny was a stand up guy' and that he never saw him as a rat.""

I really wonder what kind of New Vegas Benny wanted to make. In all honesty, he had more character than the Courier - not more than many of our *imagined* Couriers, of course, but more character than the vanilla Courier who just gets all of his shit fed to him on a silver platter and who can outgun ten people in a fight because he gets to use VATS. What kind of vision did Benny have for his tribe? What would have happened if *this* guy was allowed to really develop as both a villain and as an idealist?

The truth is, I don't know. We never got to know Benny that well - which is, I think, a little bit of a tragic missed opportunity both for us and for Bethesda. In a way it lets us imagine Benny as whatever kind of villain *we* want him to be... what exactly were his grand plans? What exactly was this cool cat thinking he could eventually do, what drove him, what made him the guy he was? I'm not sure, but I know that as a villain, Benny left a much more lasting impression on me than any of the Legion caricatures did. Even Caesar himself was comically simple when you really examine him and compare him to Benny. And I guess, in the end, that's okay. Maybe Benny's untimely demise (whether you choose to off him earlier or later) was, in a way, exactly what made him such a great villain. Because he's everything you can imagine him to be... just like the antithesis of  the Courier.

But still, you know... it's a great fucking modding opportunity, babe. *Wink, wink.*",technology,1443836989
personalfinance,"21 Years old with 8 credit cards, no debt, and a credit score of 770. My Unconventional Advice:","My 18th birthday was a big day. I had orientation at my community college, I opened up a new checking/savings, and closed my old checking/savings. (It was a mistake for closing my accounts at my old bank because it was a student account with a ""zero minimum balance"" and older accounts and lines of credit have positive impacts on credit scores.) At the time I wanted to start fresh all in my own name and at a bank with technical advances in mobile banking. Not to mention the $150 bonus for opening up a new checking/savings account.

       With a new checking/savings and with a combined total of around $1,000, I applied for every entry-level zero annual free credit card(Your major ones). At the time I was just out of HS working part time making around $6,000 a year. I was denied by every card at the time due to lack of ""age of accounts"" and ""not enough credit established."" So I settled for card with an Annual fee and SECURITY DEPOSIT. It was tough throwing money away with a fee, and then putting up an additional amount for a security deposit, when I was truly worthy of credit. It was also frustrating having more money with the bank than my monthly limit, and them still not giving me a damn credit card! 

       After months of paying on time and many more failed attempts to be accepted, I got through. My first three cards had all of the following characteristics: Big name, no annual fee, around $1,250 starting credit limit, bonus quarterly categories or other bonus plan, and $100 sign up bonus after spending a certain amount. I then contacted my original creditor (one with security deposit) and asked to be upgraded to a better card with no annual-fees. They denied me, I closed the account before a second annual fee, and I got my security deposit back. After the big three, I opened up a clothing store credit card and received 20% my total, which was a lot (I don't like to shop for clothes and try to do it twice a year or less). Then I bought a computer and learned I could defer the payment for a year with no fees or costs when paid in full after 12-months. Despite having the money in my checking to pay in full, I took the line of credit because in turn it builds credit and putting off a liability for free is an accountants dream. My seventh card is with an airline and they gave me $100 a ticket. My eighth card is with an online retailer who gave nice benefits and I believe $50 for joining. 

       One way I was able to rack up credit and 1% cash-back rewards was paying tuition with my credit cards. I am blessed with parents who pay for my tuition, and they would put the money in my bank. Again, I had the ability to pay it directly with my checking, but instead used a credit card and then paid it off a month later, in full. (Keep in mind there may be processing fees associated with using a credit card... Most schools do. I'm not sure what my Community College is thinking). Every payment on every card I have ever made has been in full and on-time. I never keep a balance on credit cards and have always maintained a growing checking/savings cushion. (Because I was a student, lived at home for free, and worked +30 hours a week)

       Today I have one more year left of college and I continue to use my credit cards for every dime I spend. Also it is common for many credit cards to offer FICO scores, but not TransUnion and Equifax (these two are available at Credit Karma). I track my credit score at Credit Karma weekly, I tried not to use company names but dammit that website is the greatest tool around.

       TDLR: If you're responsible and young take on as many lines of credit as you can. You might need to start with a Credit Card that has a security deposit, but it will give you a serious head start. Resulting in lower interest rate, higher borrowing amounts, sweet sign up bonuses, and quarterly cash-back categories. Track your credit score too!",finance,1443841919

personalfinance,Looking for some advice. $84k in student loan debt,"Hey, personsalfinance. First time poster.

I recently graduated from college with a BA in Business administration, and subsequently got a job in retail as a GM for 50k a year (pre tax). I get close to $2800 a month take home after everything is said and done. 

My grace period on my loans is coming up soon (November 11th), and I need to figure out how o want to approach paying them. I have loans through 3 separate companies (Nelnet, Navient, and Sallie Mae), and the interest rates range from 8-11% (Kill me now). 

I have considered seeing if I could get a personal loan for the full sum from a bank or lending agency, but without any collateral my shots seem pretty low. I rent an apartment with my fiancé, who is currently seeking a job (we just relocated for my new job). 

Over the past 5 months I paid off about $10k in credit card debt, leaving me with about 5k left to pay. I typically pay more than the minimum, usually $100-150 per card (I have 2 cards now, 1 with about $1k and another with about 4k) 

My monthly expenses include:

Rent (including utilities: electric, internet, Netflix) - $1000/mo

Phone bill (for both of us) - $75/mo

Credit Card payments - $350/mo

Groceries for both of us - $500/mo

Gas - $120/mo

This leaves me with about $700/mo of currently available money to throw towards my loans.

What I'd like to do, optimally, is consolidate the 3 loan companies into 1 monthly payment with 1 company and interest rate. Is there some resource or company that does this? Any other suggestions that might make this process easier for us? I've been considering even asking to defer the loans another 6 months (if it's an option) so that I can rebuild my savings for emergencies, I unfortunately had to drain the 2k I had in savings for moving costs. 

I know my fiancé getting a job will definitely help, as she will take over the groceries, phone bills, and gas portions of our monthly expenses, but we are unsure when she will get a job (hopefully in the next few weeks). 

Overall just looking for anything that might help me accomplish these goals. I'm not stressed financially but I also don't want to be paying for these loans for 20 years, so paying them off sooner is my goal.

I currently have about $20,000 in the bank, and I have about $60,000 in student loan debt, consisting of the following loans:
$7633 at 6.8%,
(monthly payment $90 for 10 yrs)

$1443 at 4.5%, 
$4518 at 3.4%, 
$22,163 at 5.4%, 
$24,057 at 6.2%
(total monthly payment $577 for 10 yrs or $328 for 25 yrs)

I'm currently staying with family while I save money to get place of my own, so total monthly expenses including gas and a car payment are probably somewhere around $500 a month. 
I would like to get a handle on this debt as quickly as possible so it's not looming over my head, but I know there are many factors to take into account.
Apparently there's some kind of tax deduction up to $2500 in student loan interest, though I read there's a phase out period to it starting at a gross income of $65,000 through $80,000 (i.e. reduced deduction up to $80,000, then no deduction after $80,000). This makes me think that throwing all my money into paying off student loans immediately might not be the best bet, but at the same time I shouldn't just pay the minimum forever since I will (hopefully) not always be eligible for the deduction.

I figure that if I can find a reputable loan consolidation company that would offer me a better interest rate, then there's no reason not to do that; however, I have heard that many companies are sketchy. SoFi was one recommended to me as a good one to check out. I've tried to read up a little on fixed rate vs variable rate loans, and from what I gather variable can be better if you plan to pay loans off quickly, so I guess this might be preferable, but I'm really not sure.

Someone suggested to just go with the longest term payment plan, so the monthly amount that I absolutely have to pay is low, but always try to pay more than the minimum. A question I had was the following: Say I go with the 25 year plan, but always pay the 10 year plan amount. If I do that the whole time, will the loan be paid off after 10 years?
I read somewhere that the interest rate of your current loans affects the rate you get when you consolidate, so would it make sense to try to immediately pay that highest rate loan off if possible?
Regardless of the payment plan, should I make sure that I at least pay off enough so that I can take the full $2500 deduction come April?

As an aside, should I even consider any kind of investing while I'm still dealing with student loans (besides a 401k deduction from my paycheck)?

personalfinance,Need advice on paying down student debt and long term planning,"I recently graduated with a BA in Philosophy and have no idea what I want to do. Regardless I realize that I need to get a job and start paying down my loans. My goal is to be financially independent so that I can pursue what I really love doing- reading and writing. 

I found an interesting internship that’ll pay me $2,000 a month while learning the business and possibly opening one myself in the future (4-5 years).

Right now, my student loans are $46,000 with an average interest rate of 5%. I decided that I want to go with Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plan as it allows me to make monthly payments at 10% of my income. PAYE gives me the option of making the bare minimum payments for 20 years and then whatever is left over is forgiven. 
Based on what I’ve researched so far, it seems that I have two options.

1.) Make more than the minimum payment due each month and try to pay off all my loans as soon as possible [If I make an average of $485 monthly payment it will cost me $58,310 in 10 years] or 2.) Make only the minimum payments which would total at about $22,000 [ I used the payment estimator off StudentLoans.gov, which assumes that my income of $20,000 will grow 5% per year]

Some information about my own expenses:

-Credit Card Debt= $0 (just paid off)

-Emergency Fund= $0 (I will start saving for this ASAP)

-Savings= $50 

-Rent= $0; my room is free- I live in a trailer parked on the property

-Groceries= $300

-Gas= $60

-Entertainment= I like to hike ($20 for gas) and read ($20)

That leaves me with about $1,600 

I have also really been struck by r/financialindependence and it seems to me that using option 2, I can start putting away money into an IRA or Index Fund (after I make an emergency fund). On the other hand, option 1 could be better because my income might go up and I could pay off my loan allowing me to do what I want sooner. 

Both these choices seem incredibly difficult right now because I don’t know what I’ll be doing in the future. I might decide to earn a PhD and teach (I know the job market is terrible for that) or continue with the business and hopefully make enough to pay off my loans.

The other is a friend of ours who is currently doing a co-op in another city, but will be moving back in a few months. I've never lived with him, but he seems like a stable guy to me.

personalfinance,Lost My Car. Live In The Middle Of Nowhere. Feel Trapped &amp; Simply Fucked.,"Guys I don't know what to do. A few days ago I was driving behind a semi and it slammed on it's breaks (idk why I couldn't see in front of it) so I slammed on my breaks and because I was going 55 my car fishtailed and I tried to hold control but the back side slid to the right and the front side of my car slid just enough (left) into the right lane to hit head on into another car. I ended up flying like 10 yards into a cornfield and was taken to the hospital. The semi driver drove off so there's no proof that that even happened plus when they drug tested me at the hospital they found several drugs in my system (I had just gotten off work and was going home completely sober from anything not prescribed) that were from days before and now they are saying I was driving on 5 different substances (including meth which I have never done) at the same fucking time so no matter what happened the accident is considered 100% my fault. My insurance is fed up with my to the point where they are dropping me and nobody else will take me so I can no longer drive. I have had so many car troubles for the 6 years I've been driving I honestly don't think I should be driving at all. So maybe this is a good thing.
(YOU CAN SKIP THE PART ABOVE TL;DR I LOST MY CAR)

I live way out in the country with in a town with shitty/almost no public transportation so I have no means of working. I have a small part time job that I can get rides to but it only reels me in about $130 every 2 weeks. I'm also helping my mom start an online business but I don't think it's going to take off enough to the point where I will be making living wage. I'm fucking 21 and can't get a full time job anymore and I'm stuck living with my mom in the middle of nowhere. I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I feel like my future has been ripped out from under me and I'm bound to be a broke loser living with his mom for years. 

I have come up with a couple idea's. One is just say fuck it and take out a huge college loan (I'd be working something with computers so it wouldn't be a huge loan and go live somewhere on campus where I can walk but the reason I haven't done this yet is I am terrified of taking out that kind of huge loan but it's the only way I could live somewhere else and do something with my life. My other idea is just to work super hard on our business and try to get more hours at my other job until I finally have enough money to move to the cities an hour away from me where I can use public transportation but that would take years to do.

Guys I feel so trapped and scared. My car was my life line. To people, to work and to getting away from my crazy mother when she goes into freakout mode. Does anyone have any other idea's or opinions on my 2 that I thought of? 

I'm scared I'm going to get stuck in a deep depressive hole being completely isolated with no way out of this situation for years.

EDIT: I also have concerns about what to tell the insurance company. I guess the only thing I can say is that I use drugs but wasn't on any during the crash (not that they will believe me). I have to fill out a report and I'm only getting a charge for crossing the yellow line but I can only fucking hope one of the people in the other car doesn't sue.

DOUBLE EDIT/APPRECIATION POST: I want to thank everyone that commented so much for helping me get an idea with how I should handle this fucked up situation. I want to apologize for the ignorance (and lack of knowledge) as I know of the few options I have but am very uninformed about them as I have not planned to be executing these plans until later in my life thus I have not done much research on them yet. But again, thank you so much to everyone in this thread showing me all the different paths that I have the option of taking and how they will effect my life. Not only has it calmed me down about the whole scary situation but also gives me a peace of mind that everything can be okay and work itself out if I do this correctly. I know I have made some huge fuck-ups in my life and even though this isn't directly my fault (even though on paper it is because the semi that brake checked me drove away making me look like the sole person who caused the accident) I appreciate that you guys are still helping me get my life back on track. You really are a great community.",finance,1443910440

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter's_law)  
  
Can you feel that?  It feels like a stadium of 200,000 fans, all cheering for the fabled emergence of the legendary artist who's supposed to be performing.  Sure, the show is delayed - it's always delayed because there's just too many variables, but stop thinking of the world in such rigid terms.  *Look at the evidence*:  
  
We sit in a position of **bewildering adoption:**  
  
- banks are scampering over one another to understand and incorporate this mysterious ""blockchain""  
- major *major* players in the financial industry are leaving powerful positions to better understand this phenomenon (and making the front page of business magazines regarding it)  
- I can mention bitcoin in a room full of 20 strangers and am nearly guaranteed that at least a few will have heard of it  
- Entire countries are starting to rely on the stability of it as a currency as their national fiat fails.  
- Russia (and other major nations) are eating themselves up debating its legality while *head* members of their government admit to being involved (and there are discussions of creating a nationally branded version)  
- Old news, I know, but major companies all over the world are accepting it.... just think about that though: the idea that Microsoft accepts bitcoin is now 'old news'.  
  
**And the price has bottomed and stabilized for more than a year.**    
  
The cries of ""gillion dollar bitcoins"" have died down and quite frankly now sound a little silly.  Meanwhile 'real' financial problems have started plaguing the globe - stock markets all over the world are cracking under the stress of unnatural growth and the lies they were founded on.  Every month a new national currency seems to plunge into the abyss.  Billionaires are watching as their entire fortunes vaporize into the aether from which they came: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-02/china-billionaire-with-canal-dream-confronts-biggest-loss-of-15  
  
**Good**.  How **else** did you expect it to possibly go down?  Do you believe the world will sing songs of friendship as bitcoin pierces the $10k level, and then the $100k level?  No.  It's going to be a Zapp Brannigan scale catastrophe.  And as this current wave of crypto-cooling finally draws to an end, the next titanic swelling of interest won't be laid on top of a chorus of songs about friendship and magic.  It will be a cacophony of this face, right here: http://i.imgur.com/4c7nV0O.png  
  
That's the bitcoin face.  That's the face of someone who finally realizes that every ounce of 'money' they've ever believed in is all fairy dust and make believe.  That's the face of someone who finally understands money for the first time.  
  
**Bottom line**: Since birth, bitcoin (and all crypto) has undergone a violent series of movements - rocketships and crashes, starting at one cent and culminating at $1200+.  With such a new financial universe the early movements were rapid and violent, even though they were comparatively small in the global scheme of things.  But as the financial universe of cryptocurrency grows we can expect to see those major movements grow less frequent over time *while increasing in real-world intensity*.  It just looks a little dismal at the moment because our latest (and longest) movement was a downward one from the recent hype peak of late 2013.  
  
Remember that?  Everyone was talking about crypto; it was on the news, and random animal based altcoins were popping up everwhere.  We went from 20 cryptocurrencies to over 1,000.  Bitcoins and crypto were on the tip of everyone's tongue.  
  
**Well that's nothing.**  
  
When this next wave kicks off (and it will be very soon, possibly sometime next year) you are going to see a big bang of crypto that may just send us soaring right past the tipping point of the entire technology.  
  
My predictions for the next crypto-rush?  
  
- Forget 1,000 currencies and blockchains; you will see 10,000 as everyone jumps on board making blockchains for everything (and almost all of them inevitably fail)  
- The news will be on fire with talk of them, and even spend entire segments discussing them with 'experts'.  
- The US Government will begin talks for the first time about incorporating bitcoin and other crypto into operations at the federal level.  
- Companies will begin to accept crypto directly, not just through a proxy service.  
- We will see the first brick-and-mortar crypto exchanges pop up because the entire business will be so lucrative.  People will be racing to own ""an entire bitcoin"".  
- A price rise to anywhere from $15,000 to $20,000.  News headlines will say things like, ""Well... it used to only cost $200 but if you bought one, you could trade it for a car now!""  
- /r/bitcoin will eclipse a million subscribers.  
  
And this wave will last a period of *years*, not months.  That's important to remember is that each wave lasts longer than the one before it.  So if the next wave begins in 2016 we will likely see it swell upward until 2019 at least before the inevitable retraction begins.

personalfinance,Looking for debt/investing advice for my spouse and I.,"My spouse and I are finally making enough to start paying off our debt a little more / investing. 

We as of recently, make $100k/yr together, and have about $55k in debt, comprising of auto loans, student loans, and credit card debt. The highest interest rate on the debt is 9.9%, and the majority of our debt is student loans.

We have a small emergency fund, probably enough to last a month. I'm planning on adding to that monthly until we have a 3 month emergency fund.

We are currently managing our debt well, and our plan is to have all of our debt paid off in 2 or 3 years, by paying off our debts highest interest first, and rolling the payments about from paid-off debt into each other source of debt.

My main question is about a state retirement program that I paid into during my previous employment.
We currently have no employer sponsored retirement plans. I am considering rolling that amount over into a Roth IRA, but I am wondering would it better to cash it out, and take the tax hit (35%), and use it to pay off 10% of our debt immediately. This would include immediately paying off our highest interest debt (credit card).",finance,1443916607
personalfinance,Fact checking for mortgage refinance - Confirm what I am being told as True/False,"Hi everyone! I am strongly considering a refinance on my primary residence and would like to ask the more knowledgeable members of this sub to help me confirm what I am being told is accurate, and to help make the decisions.  Here is the background:

I am looking to refinance my primary residence for several reasons. 
* 1: To take advantage of interest rates before they go up.
* 2: To remove my parents as co-signers on my original loan for all our peace of mind and also to assist them when they refi some investment properties AND
* 3: To possibly do a cash out loan to buy out a partner in another investment property I also own.  This is not set in stone, I'm just keeping it as a possibility depending how things look as I proceed. The main idea is to refi for the lower rate/get rid of co-signers.  

**Current Loan**
* Purchased in 2013
* Currently owe $273,473.23 at 4.75%
* No PMI, monthly payments of $1471.05 (Principle + Interest)
* Total Remaining interest of $221,187
* Home is likely to appraise at ~$472,000

**Refi terms**
This is as provided by the lender I have been in contact with.  I have not actually submitted the application because I wanted to do my due diligence first. 
* Rate of 3.99 with zero points. 
* Closing costs: ~$3530 (appraisal $530, Bank Fees $1495, Title/Escrow fees between $1200-1500)
* My math shows the new payment will be ~$1302/mo
* Break Even point is 21 months with the savings of $169/mo
* Total remaining interest of $195,699 compared to current amount of $221,187

**Questions**
* 1 The lender is telling me that because I will likely have 40% equity provided the appraisal comes in at $460,000 or higher that my credit score will not be a factor as long as it is over 660.  Is this accurate?
* 2 If this is not accurate does anyone have the cutoffs in terms of where each ""tier"" for credit scores are for getting the best interest rates? I am being told to just start the application process and not worry about it, but I want to clarify first.  I was told by him that 740 is the cutoff to get the best interest rates.  I am right on the cusp, as of a report I have from July I was 740 on the dot, and I suggested I pay down some/all 0% interest debt I have to help boost the score by improving the credit utilization rate. (I am not significantly in debt, I churn airline miles on various cards and transferred some debt around to free up cash a few months ago, I am liquid enough to pay if off today if I want). 
* 3 The reason I have cosigners on the house is that the loan almost fell through on the last day of escrow because the final underwriter was not ok with the fact that I already had another mortgage.  That home is an investment property that was purchased in 2005 and I am one of 4 people on the loan. Currently I am being told that this is not an issue, but I am a bit leery as that was what I was told in 2013 and I had to get cosigners at the last minute.  Is this likely to remain an issue?

I'm employed as a math teacher. My wife is a stay at home mom. We have two kids with a third on the way(due on Christmas). 
I own a three family rental property in which my family lives in one unit and I rent the other two. In addition, I work part time at a second job.
My credit score is 790-800 range. 

My student loans and my mortgage is my only debt and the since it's a multi family at least it pays for itself every month. I'm seriously considering never paying a dime on these student loans and defaulting purposefully. I know it will kill my credit but the loan payments are already $600 and climbing since I'm not paying anything on them right now. My wife has good credit so I'll still have access to credit indirectly through her. I guess I could make the payment but it would stretch us every month. I just don't want to have to sacrifice any extra money that could be better spent on my family.

I know it's probably a bad idea, but I'm welcome to any advice that might help me. I'm trying to get ahead, and I need some sound guidance.

We're a married Canadian couple in our late 20's, early 30's. We currently live in the UK (London). We're both terrible money managers, and have decided to finally get our shit together. Here are our specifics:

Income:
She brings in approximately **£1,650/month**. This is steady income.
He brings in approximately **$2,500CAN/month**. This is not steady, and he is paid sporadically throughout the year (contract work). He works from London for a company in Canada.

Expenses: 

- Rent - By far the biggest. In a lease we cannot break until April 2016, at which point we plan on finding cheaper accommodation: **£1,250/month**
- Utilities (gas/electric, water, council tax) comes to approximately **£250/month**
- Internet - **£17/month**
- Transportation - public transportation. She spends **£86/month**, His varies, approximately **£78/month**
- Cell phones - two phones, **£30/month**
- Groceries - We host a lot of dinners with friends, and she really likes to cook. We spend approximately **£400/month**
- Entertainment (restaurants, drinks, etc) approximately **£350/month**
- Debt payments - **$500CAN/month** all are Canadian debts

Debts:

- His
  - Government Student Loans - **$9,500CAN** zero interest
  - LOC - **$4,800CAN** - 6% interest - this is closed, and he cannot utilize it to consolidate debt
  - Credit Card as of today **$1,500CAN** - 18% interest
  - Federal Government Income Tax Owed - **$5,700** paying instalments. Currently being reassessed by them, and will set up a payment schedule once they've finished the reassessment

- Hers
 - LOC - **$7,000CAN** - 10% interest rate
 - Credit Card - **$2,500CAN** - 18% interest
 - Student Loans - **$20,000CAN** - Payments do not start until January 2016

Savings (combined):

- approximately **$9,000CAN**

**TOTALS**

- **Income - £1,650 + $2,500CAN**

- **Expenses - £2,461 + $500CAN**

- **Assets - $9,000CAN**

- **Liabilities - $51,000**

Sorry for the different currencies. 

Banking Set-up:

Currently we have a joint account in the UK which her salary goes into, and our expenses come out of. We use our Canadian credit cards for groceries, transit, and really everything we can, which he pays off with his Canadian income. We usually do not carry a balance on the credit cards for over a month, but sometimes with his sporadic work, it happens.

Our backgrounds are in international development and refugee work. We have resigned ourselves to the fact that we aren't going to make large-salaried jobs. So, now it is a matter of learning to live within our means, so we can prepare for our future. 

And to be honest, we think a lot of the advice that will hopefully come in are things we already know we need to do, and should happen; it's just a matter of hearing it from someone else. 

This is painful to write out. We need help.

1 - My rental property has a second on it that has a balance of 43,700 and I pay 175.00 per month. It only has a year left before it resets to a principle+interest payment, which should put it's payment someplace around 250.00 per month. It has a 3.99% interest rate on it right now.
2 - My truck has a balance of 7500, and has a payment of 237.00 per month. I still have 2 years left to pay on it. It's interest rate is 8.25%.
With my credit cards now paid off, I have about 500 dollars of extra money per month that I can use to one of these bills to help pay it off (the truck), or get the balance down for when it resets (the house second). I'm not sure what to do; if I start dumping this 500 into the truck, it's a depreciating asset.

personalfinance,The IRS is out to get me,"I'm not one of those paranoid people, just wanted a good title. :-)

My partner and I bought our first place 2 years ago, and due to a miscommunication from our broker (did not advice the gay couple that you should have a joint checking account for closing), we had to do some money scrambling for our closing costs. My partner was saving most of the money for our down-payment/closing costs and I paid bills, did grocery shopping with my money. Yes, we were stupid and did not have a joint account. So fast-forward to getting close to closing time, it made the most sense to have only my name on the mortgage as I have incredible credit and the interest rate was super low with just my credit, but that also meant that the money for closing had to be MY money and there could be no shuffling around of money from my partners personal checking to mine. Soooo I had to get creative and withdrew $6k from my IRA to make up the difference of what I had and what we needed for closing. My broker said I wouldn't be penalized since it's was a first time home-buyer situation and the IRS would realize it during tax time, so no special forms or processes to go through. Well, the deal fell through and we didn't move forward with closing. A week later we find another place and moved forward quickly - at that point I had already re-deposited the $6k and withdrew it again it for the new closing costs. Everything went smooth, bought the place, here we are.

I got a notice from the IRS saying that I owe them $2,500 for the IRA withdrawal. I'm guessing since I had to withdrawal it twice that it messed with the system...?

personalfinance,2nd Car Questions,"My SO and I have come to the conclusion we need a second car. As much as we have tried to avoid it, our work schedules just don't allow it. We currently have a dependable, but relatively high mileage car that I expect to get a few more years out of. I also have a motorcycle that I use as a daily driver for a good chunk of the year. However, we live in New England and as winter comes in, there are at least 3 months of the year where driving it is impractical. My SO often bikes to work and we have saved tons of money by me doing all my own mechanical work (Dad was a mechanic).

My question pertains to the next step. If we buy new and finance, we can put $1500 or so down and can reasonably afford a monthly payment in the $300 range. Ideally, this means a low mileage new(er) with little immediate maintenance. Our credit is good (not great) meaning a little higher interest rate. 

As a mechanic's kid, my thought is of course to buy something used for cash and if it needs minor stuff (hopefully not major stuff) I'll just do it myself. I've maintained our current car well in the time I've owned it. Secondly, being that 8 months of the year I'm on the motorcycle, I know it won't get all that much use. It just so happens that the internship requirement of my grad program has me driving a lot and we keep running into situations where having a second car would be clutch. Public trans is bad here and I don't have coworkers to carpool with. 

Just looking for a little insight. I have never purchased a new car and have always paid cash for used and drive them into the ground.",finance,1443971772
personalfinance,Paying off high interest student loans vs Roth while I still can,"Made a new account to keep my details as private as possible.

I'm a recent grad carrying a massive amount of student loan debt at number of different fixed interest rates and I just accepted my first real job.  I'm trying to figure out what my financial focus should be in my first few months.

My financial situation:
$165k in federal loan debt.
Approximately $80k at 1.72%
Approximately $80k at 6.8%
$5.5k at 8.5% from when I accepted a PLUS loan by mistake.
I have $8k in a Roth IRA but no other savings to speak of beyond that.
I'm single and have no debt beyond the student loans.

My new job should net about $6k every month.

The repayment plan:
I switched my loans from the standard 10 year repayment to a 20 year graduated plan with lower payments up front (approx $500) and higher payments later on.  I plan to make the minimum payment possible across all my loans then make an additional large overpayment directed at the highest interest loans first so those get paid off quickly; I'm budgeting approximately $1000 extra a month for this.

My employer operates a 401(k) and makes a fixed contribution regardless of my own contribution.  Starting next year my gross income will likely be just barely too high to put money in my Roth IRA anymore.  

Is it more important to try to get $5500 in my Roth before next April while I still can or should I focus totally on the 8.5% then 6.8% student loan debt?",finance,1443972833

personalfinance,​35 y/o married working parents (4 kids) looking to confirm big-picture plans for now and the future,"​This is my first post to this forum, so please be kind if I'm not using this thing correctly (I have read the rules, and the relevant sidebar info multiple times).

&amp;nbsp;

My plan is to present what follows to my spouse and work with them to take the next steps to making this happen. I'm looking for any help on how I might adjust this before having that discussion. Does anyone see any red flags? Does this plan generally look good, but need a few tweaks? Any and all feedback is welcome. Nearly all of this is based on what I've found in the sidebar of this forum.

&amp;nbsp;

Goals:
&amp;nbsp;

• Become debt free.
&amp;nbsp;

• Build emergency fund of $30k.
&amp;nbsp;

• TBD life-fufilling goal (we're still working on this; building a small homestead/tiny house and a self-sustaining farm out in the country, become the owners of an F1 racetrack, start our own space exploration company, etc.; hopefully the goal will be something that will bring us more money for retirement, i.e. not buying a speed boat)
&amp;nbsp;

• Retire with enough money in the bank to live a great life w/o bothering our kids; probably $3m+.

&amp;nbsp;

Starting snapshot (all indicates combined income/expenses):
**Income**: Gross $176k± a year. After taxes, insurance and child support obligations: $116k a year, or about $9700 a month.
&amp;nbsp;
**Debt**: $36k in student loans at a range of interest rates (between 2%-7%)

&amp;nbsp;

**Steps 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6** (from sidebar, per month below).

We don't currently follow a budget, which I'm working on and will post for comment separately. In big picture form it looks like this (I've started with the 50/15/5/5 rule, and modified it):

&amp;nbsp;

50% of net to bills: $4800
&amp;nbsp;

6%* of gross to retirement: $880
&amp;nbsp;

5% to leisure: $480
&amp;nbsp;

5% to emergency fund: $750
&amp;nbsp;

*this is our max employee matching percentage

&amp;nbsp;

The rest (about $2700) goes to:
a) Debt (avalanche method) until the 36k is paid off, then we start putting this ""extra"" money to the
b) Emergency fund until we get to $30k in savings, at which point (about 2 years from now), we would
c) Start investing more into our 401k funds, or some other retirement account (IRA?, raised to 15%-20% of our gross) and putting it toward the TBD goal above (which may be more saving).

&amp;nbsp;

I have a few questions about budgeting, and our retirement accounts, and future investing, but I will save those for later posts; I'm just looking for big picture confirmation that this plan makes sense.",finance,1443978407

I'm a college student going for my degree in psychology. Now, looking at the reactions to that statement I've seen on this sub before, try not to scold me. I'm going for, and am pretty likely to get, a career that would pay in the range of 60k-80k/yr out of college.  
  
However, it's a *very* specific field and with that combined with me not being a pretty average person demographically, I'm pretty much shit out of luck when it comes to finding scholarships. So, I'm pretty much paying for the rest of my schooling with federal student loans. I checked how much I owe so far (~27,000), and with a about 3 semester left, I'm probably looking at around $45-50k total once I'm out. I'm not too happy with that number, but am I right in thinking it shouldn't be *extremely* difficult to deal with that amount assuming I do make a job out of college paying in that range?

electronics,Function Generator [Schematic Review],"Hey all,

So this is my first serious electronics project, and I figured I should probably try to get some feedback before I try to push this through to a PCB.

http://imgur.com/yKNKjID

EDIT1: Split rail fix: http://imgur.com/KsCVYjC

It's pretty standard as far as design goes. It's a relaxation oscillator based function generator. The main oscillator is comparator based, and outputs a square wave based on the threshold voltage set by R1 and R4, as well as the rise time of the RC network formed by R3, POT1A, and the capacitor network next to them. POT1A gives fine control over the frequency, and the SP8T controls the range of frequencies, from 1Hz to 10MHz.

A simple non-inverting amplifier acquires a rough triangle wave from the voltage on the capacitor in the oscillator.

This triangle wave is fed into an integrator (to generate the sine wave) who's feedback capacitor will be matched with the one in the oscillator (the two switches are ganged) so that the gain stays within limits. This signal is then passed through the capacitor network to remove DC bias, and the non-inverting amplifier after it will balance the gain of the integrator for fine frequency adjustments (POT1A, 1B, and 1C are all ganged).

These three signals are then fed into an attenuation/push pull output stage, which is connected to a BNC output jack.

It runs on a +/-5V split rail generated from the two regulators on the top left of the page. U2 outputs +10V, U1 outputs +5V, and the bottom line is at zero potential. The +5V is taken as a virtual ground point, effectively generating a +/-5V supply. The input voltage will probably come from a laptop charger.

personalfinance,School won't give me my financial aid.,"tl;dr my college login (portal/blackboard) said I had 3,500 in financial grant/aid. Went to transfer money from grant to pay for past semester. Money didn't go through. Went on vacation. Came back around when school starts. didn't realize there was a problem (no email or anything). Financial aid office took a while to figure out what was wrong as well but by the time that happened it was already too late.  

Hello reddit. This is my first post to personal finance and in kind of a pickle with my financial aid. So I'll start off back in June. 
    
   So June (2015) comes around and i decided to due to my fasfa. I finished it in about half an hour and receive an email from my school email that they got it. after a few days, i see that i have a grant of $3,500.

   By the time I see this I'm like ""This is great, I can pay for my past semester."" So I go to school and go to the paying office to pay. I tell them what I have and they give me a paper to sign stating that i'm going to use my grant to pay off the past semester and they will send the excess money as a check in the mail.
This happens right before I leave for vacation for about two months so i don't have to worry about this kind of stuff. 

I come back from vacation around late August and decided to register for classes BUT unfortunately i am still locked out for not paying for past semesters. (If you have any sort of due to pay it locks you out from registering for classes. Thus why I decided to register at this time because it would already be paid for or so i thought.) I assume there was an issue that had gone wrong somewhere but there was no email or any signs something was wrong.

Now I take multiple trips to the school to resolve this issue. I went to the paying center and they told me to talk to the financial aid office. I go there and I tell the lady what happened and she takes a look at my account and has a look on her face that there was something wrong with my account but she didn't even know what was wrong.She gets a few of her coworkers to look something at the screen and tells me that I'll receive a call from Marco the next day (I'm assuming Marco was like the manager or someone higher up). But i never received that call.

The next week rolls around (September) and still never got that call. Now I have to go back to school and wait on these long lines just to talk to someone. When i finally got to talk they finally tell me that I have been missing paperwork (tax transcripts). 

So I go to the IRS website to request me and my parents transcripts and will be delivered in the mail in 6-10 business days. Fast forward to when i get in in the mail and talking to the financial aid THE LADY TELLS ME IT IS TOO LATE TO HAND IT IN. I get really frustrated and I'm like WTF.  At this pointed I'm fed up with these long fucking lines and how long all this bullshit took me only to find out that it's too late. AND TO ADD INJURY TO INSULT she tells me that they sent an email in June informing me what i am missing. And in my head I'm like impossible but wasn't sure so I took her word for it. I decided to walk away and in her exact words as i was walking were ""Check your junk mail sweetie."" 

Well I did check my junk mail (what a stupid place to put such important information) and what do you know? THERE WAS NO FUCKING EMAIL.   

Reddit I'm fed up. I get frustrated just thinking about it. I guess writing this makes me feel a little better. Do you think there is any action to be taken?",finance,1444000168

I have had rheumatoid arthritis for ten years and require VERY expensive IV infusions every month. I have insurance through my job, my premium is $471 while my company covers $300 of that.

This means that I will meet my maximum out of pocket of $4K each year for the indefinite future. I am on the highest level of coverage that my company offers. 

My boyfriend recently got a new job where he will now be making significantly more AND his insurance coverage is out of this world. Essentially the company will pay for any and all health issues that come up. No copays, no premiums, no out of pocket.

I've looked into domestic partnerships, but from my research it seems like we can only do that if we are the same sex or one of us is 62 years old. Neither of those things is happening anytime soon.

economy,Why you should not worry about a US dollar collapse,"I recently published an in-depth analysis of the US dollar and its current situation to give people a broader perspective on the future of the world’s reserve currency.

Important highlights from the article on why the dollar will not collapse soon:

1. Japan will continue its experiment with the most radical quantitative easing attempted by a major country in the history of the world… and the experiment is getting dangerous. &gt;&gt; From all appearances, Japan’s leadership is fully prepared to push the yen much lower than it is now. That will help owners of dollars and dollar-denominated assets.

2. Europe is headed for a crisis at least as severe as the Grexit scare was in 2012—and for the resulting run-up in interest rates and a sovereign debt scare in the peripheral countries. &gt;&gt; As you might imagine, no one who owns euros is happy with this situation. Dollar interest rates may not be very high, but they are better than the euro alternative.

3. China is approaching its day of reckoning as it tries to reduce its dependency on debt in its bid for growth, while creating a consumer society. &gt;&gt; There is a strong chance China will experience either a hard landing or a long period of very slow growth. While we expect much volatility, China’s transition should be bullish for the dollar as the trade balance moves closer to equilibrium.

4. All of the above will tend to be bullish for the dollar, which will make dollar-denominated debt in emerging-market countries more difficult to pay back.

My inlaws live in the same city and are looking to retire in the next 5-6 years. I would like to get out of renting and buy a house, however my household income is 56k~ish. I will receive significantly raises each year 3k~ and make 190k+ after 5 years, but it would be a struggle to buy the home we want on our own right now. The inlaws make 120k (own their home) and have offered to buy/move into a family home near the university. The idea is to get a 275k home where I put down the 55k down payment and both contribute to the mortgage. I'm guaranteed a Jr faculty position after 6 years so I do want to stay in the home for an extended period. In addition it would cut the inlaws commute from 45-55mins one way to 15mins one way and free them up to sell their current home at their leisure. The agreement would then require me to help secure the mortgage on the inlaws retirement lake house using the funds from the inlaws current home (worth 200k). We have no student loans or other debts and we live very frugally. Ideally both mortgages would be 15 year loans and paid off asap. I've never owned a home and just want your thoughts on what I'm getting myself into financially.

Gas	                    60.00	
Yearly Expenses	    280.00 (all annual fees)
This leaves 17.7k a year (1475/month) to save/put toward expenses for a home with inlaws. I don't have the time to take vacations/spend my money and the spouse is a penny pincher.
Assets - 2 cars 2006, 2008 paid off
60k in vanguard (will move to saving acct if we agree to look at homes)
15k in roth ira
Inlaws 900k for retirement would be set for retirement if we assist with their housing.
Spouse stays at home with infant and we all have good credit 780+

Looking at mortgages for a 275k home with 55k down + closing costs paid by inlaws we could get a 15year mortgage with an interest rate around 3.1%. Payments would be 1550 a month + 350 in property taxes + 450 monthly home insurance + 200 monthly maintenance.

I'm wondering at that rate would it just be better to buy the place and put that monthly $1400 towards a mortgage. But I'm hesitant to take on more debt when I already have the student loans. I also need to buy or lease a car if I move out and am not sure which would be better.  If am am leasing a car, renting an appt, and paying back loans I feel like I would be spending all my money and getting no equity back. 

I basically have no idea where to start- should I target the loans, should I buy a car, should I just wait and save? Does anyone have advice for me?",finance,1444054767

personalfinance,I think i'm doing good..? but want to do better.,"So I'm unsure what information I need to give in order for everyone to get a good understanding so I'll try my best..

I'm 24 years old and make about 58-62k a year(Overtime/quarterly bonuses). Currently I do not have many bills to pay and I dont see myself having many in the next 2-3 years. I live with my parents but they are selling the house so I'm going to live with my brother. He will not charge me rent but I will pay a little for utilities and food which have yet to be decided.

The bills I do pay are 
~266/mo for car loan (I have ~16k left)
~408/mo for student loan (think theres ~30k left)
~367 2 payment installments for car insurance (one in october next in december)

This is IT! My gas/tolls can be expensed.. I get a certain amount per mile (something like .55)
Phone bill can be expensed.

I do not spend much money throughout the week.. maybe a bagel and coffee in the morning but usually eat breakfast at home. The one thing I do need to give up is eating out for lunch.. my coworkers do it and a lot of the times im at a client and all I want to do is get out of their office... I know I need to give this up and pack my own lunch. Most weekends I spend with my girlfriend and we usually split costs of things, we go out to eat and go to bars (shes still in college). I would say I never spend more then 100$.

I take home bi-weekly about $1,220. Before I see that money 400$ goes into a company 401K and once I get the money 300$ of it automatically goes to a Capital One savings account (future expenses-saving for home I guess is the next big thing)

I recently started using YNAB this weekend and have yet to really been able to start logging transactions but I am very excited to do so.

My plan is to pay off the car loan ASAP. I want to see if I can bump up the payments per month.. if I can afford 1,000$/mo and pay that off in 16-20 months that would be amazing. Then I would diverge all that money into paying off my student loans.

My questions I have are as follows - is there any.... correct order for this? Should I be leaving my smaller loan and paying off high interest loans first? My student loan has 5-6 % interest rates on some of them.. I can get more details if needed.

Should I ever take money away from my 401K (300/paycheck) or my Capital One Savings (400/paycheck) in order to bump up payment on loans?

Savings has around 8k and 401k has about 10k. Am I doing it right? If I want to start renting/looking for a home in 2 years.. am I going down the right road? (also work for a company that is not afraid to give you the money if you earn it, just got a huge raise and looking for another one next year that will hopefully put me in the 70-80k region).",finance,1444055831

personalfinance,Help - what are our options?,"Hi all - I just need some advice on my current financial crisis.. 

My SO and I are to a point where we can't sleep anymore. He is a commercial real estate broker, and due to some unforeseen hangups, he has had a few big deals blow up in a row this year, leaving him with virtually no income for about six months now.

There is no savings left. I work full time, but my small income is really only enough to cover our rent, utilities, and my car payment each month. Everything else, we have just been scrambling for. 

As far as expenses... We each have a car payment, both with fairly shitty interest rates due to mediocre credit. He has to pay $750/month in child support for his 5-year-old daughter (who we also have with us 1 day a week and every other weekend). Groceries, fuel for two commutes, and a couple other unavoidable expenses. 

At this point, we have sold or are currently selling almost everything we own. A car, 3 TV's, my music equipment, his iPad, everything. The last thing I have of any value is my Gretsch guitar, which was my graduation gift from my dad. I planned to pass it on to my kids someday. But we might be getting to the point where we will need to sell it to buy groceries and fuel to get to work. I don't know how to cope with that, really. Should I allow myself to sell my prized possession, or do I just hide from debt collectors for another month to try to avoid it? Who knows. 

Honestly, I think what worries me the most is my boyfriend. It is so hard to see him work his ass off all day, every day, then bring his laptop home and keep working, for literally zero money. He is working on deals that should (hopefully..) close this month then be paid out 30 days after that, but I have no idea what we are going to do until then. Every day I see his eyes look more and more tired. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and he's just staring off into space. This is wearing on him greatly. I am so worried about his well being, and we are running out of options.

We are at that point where we just have to pick and choose what to pay and what to let fall delinquent. We have no choice. We can't really work more than we are already working. So the question is, what do we pay? Do we pay rent and not utilities? Do we pay child support but not rent, and hope we have money before we get evicted? Do we try to pay on the car payments or just ignore them until we can pay them AND rent? We can't pay for all of our expenses for October, and probably not in November either. We will be able to catch up in December, but how do we prioritize until then? 

Any advice would be appreciated. I have made so many sacrifices to be with this man, because he's so worth it. He is amazing and a hardworking, honest person. He has so much integrity and it's killing me to see him become more and more hopeless. I give him my entire paycheck and we budget it together... or try to. But we are both starting to become seriously depressed and scared.

We're both working again now so the money isn't a problem, but the interest on the loan is a hard pill to swallow. My father in law mentioned extra principle payments would help. How would that help? And how much extra per month would make that kind of thing be beneficial to me?

Ps, I am fully aware that the payment is super high. But with negative equity and no down payment, what do you expect? I'm just glad to be out of the lease and into a car I'll actually own at some point.

personalfinance,Question about saving for kid's college,"So I have a seven week–old daughter, and I am trying to determine what the best course of action will be to save for her education. Odds are that she won't qualify for much aid, since my wife and I bring in about $170K/year between us, though we live in the expensive DC area.

We have about $25K in our emergency fund. My wife and I both contribute up to the match for her 403(b) and my TSP. While I fully fund my Roth IRA, we have not done so for my wife. I'm kind of hesitant to do a 529 or Coverdell in part because I think that there will be some sort of paradigm shift in higher education in the next 18 years, given how untenable the increasing prices and student loan situation is becoming.

I'm entertaining the idea of using my wife's Roth IRA account as a potential vehicle to save for my kids' college expenses. The reason I would do so is because when we retire some 25-30 years down the road, we would have Social Security, my TSP, her 403(b), my Roth IRA, and my pension (which would be at least about $52K/year in 2015 dollars, adjusted for inflation, *assuming no changes are made to federal pensions for which I would not be grandfathered in*). 

In some sense, I feel like doing so would give us some protection in the case that we actually need the money for our own retirement (maxing out my wife's Roth IRA will happen from this year forward, no matter what), or save us from penalties if our kids do not go to college.

Either way, I know not to start an ESA or 529 until we max out our Roth IRAs at the least (some say maxing out the 401(k) limit should also be happening). Can you please let me know why this is a terrible idea? Thanks!",finance,1444060032

personalfinance,Was manic in the process of getting into an MS in IT. How do I mop up $5k in credit card debt?,"Edit: I actually have bipolar disorder which is stable on medication, but not if I overwork myself, which I was forced to do.

I basically sacrificed everything about my health, body, social life, and finances to get into a master's in IT.

But it was worth it because I found out I got in this week!!! :D

And EVEN BETTER I went to the career fair and am being poached for internships for companies worth $15-$50 billion! I'm not a failure or a phony!

I feel very happy that I have financial security for the future because my undergrad is in the social sciences/humanities so that degree would not have turned a profit whatsoever, and because I was feeling very suicidal and manic but managed to not take any time off or slow down. I was also doing prereqs for two years *hoping* to get in, so it could have all been for nothing. But I did it, yay! My mental health is fine now.

But uhh. Now I have to mop up the mess.

I'm 30lbs heavier, and I'm a very short girl. I needed new winter clothes completely. I managed to break a bunch of shit in my house (agitated/clumsy...). And oh yeah, I gained that weight from eating out almost constantly while studying for finals then the GRE.

Now I have $4k-$5k in credit card debt. I also, however, have a credit score of 750 and I also filled out the form for federal student loans and start in spring. I am 24.

My family pays my tuition and rent but doesn't give me much money for anything besides that. I'm at my internship and my paycheck is ~$500-$750. I know that is a lot since I don't pay rent, utilities, car, or tuition/books but I was just spending like crazy and could only sleep 3 hours a night and was laughing randomly. I'm happy I didn't get fired.

All of it is on a points card from USAA with a 11% APR I've had for 5 years. I paid off my AMEX and always pay off my Double Cash because they have higher rates and I want the cash back. I always pay as much as possible and keep about $100 in my checking. I have never been late on a payment in my entire life. My credit limit is $19,000 so I'm still using &lt;30% of my limit. I put all of the cards in a drawer except my Double Cash. 

I do not have kids or pets and I will get another cheap apt when I get a job. I have an 03 civic with 90k miles which was a gift I'm going to keep as long as possible and is working perfectly now. My ONLY debt is this credit card debt.

Should I take out a federal student loan to reduce interest and pay it back when I graduate? How should I tackle this credit card debt? I am very frugal when I'm not manic.

I apologize if this was too long. I am very long winded, even when I am euthymic. At least I know this is a temporary problem and in the end the mental health and credit card hit was totally worth it.

personalfinance,old debt that can be paid vs. old debt that will age off my credit report,"Long time lurker, first time poster (throwaway ftw).

In 2008 I took out a medical credit card to pay for surgery.  The total amount was around $16k.  We kept up with it for a little bit but then quickly fell behind and as with any other high interest rate credit card (which was a bad choice to begin with, #lessonslearned) the amount came too much for us to even consider taking care of and fell to collectors.  The year is now 2015 and the debt is around $15k.  I'm told that the amount of time that the debt holder can collect on this debt through legal means has expired.  The collector is now willing to settle the debt for $2k which we can do with a little help from family.  The collector group will report to the debt holder that the amount has been settled and the account closed.  The debt holder then has to report to the credit bureaus in accordance with the Fair Credit and Reporting Act.

I contacted the debt holder and made sure everything was on the up and up.  They told me that it was and that they report to the credit bureaus on the 15th and 30th of every month.  I requested that if settled that they REMOVE the item from my credit report, they informed me that they would not do that, but would confirm that the debt had been settled with the credit bureaus.

Is there a down side to us settling for WAY less than the debt is ""worth""? Is there something wrong with the situation resolving this way?  What are my better options?

I've always somewhat struggled with not overspending, but have figured things out to at least stay afloat in the past. I'm in a position now where I have no wiggle room, and would like some advice if possible. I've never made a late payment, and even though my credit score is pretty low right now, it's likely because my debt/credit ratio is horrible.

I net around $3000/mo (paid on the first and 15th, around $1500). I have a roommate, and they pay for half of the household expenses. 

My bills are:

* Water/Electric ($90)
* Natural Gas ($25)
* Yard Care ($25)
* Internet ($35)
* Garbage ($20)

* Citi American Express ($95 / $4,900 / $4,900)
* Costco American Express ($45 / $2,000 / $2,000)

Personal Bills

* Car Insurance ($60)
* Renter's Insurance ($15)

Monthly Expenses

* Gas ($30)
* Groceries ($100)
* Savings ($300 - goal not currently being met)

The Prosper/LendingClub loans were from consolidation attempts I had made in the past. I dumped my CC balances into those to try and pay them off at a better interest rate and with fixed, monthly payments. I had some medical bills (cracked my hip) and moving expenses that 'forced' me to use my CC (I didn't have a large enough savings to draw from). After that, I got into the habit of using my CC again.

I'm fully aware that I've done this to myself, and I've removed all my CCs from my wallet (again) and removed them from any online merchant.

I've also looked at my spending history, and notice that I've been waaaay too lax with dining out, and I'm reigning that in.

I have GnuCash, and while that works for awhile to help track my expenses, it's really difficult for me to keep up with adding transactions in there. I purchased YNAB awhile ago, but it didn't really feel like it was that helpful to me. Maybe I should give it another shot?

Based on the above numbers, my expenses are about $2960 with my income at $3000 - so as long as I dont have fun or eat out, I have enough money. The other troublesome issue is that my roommate pays me their half of bills at the beginning of the month for the previous month. This means i'm floating ~$700 during the month before I get that paid back to me. I think this has been the biggest part of my issue, because this is a new roommate and my previous roommate and I had a different method of paying bills that did not have me floating them for the month.

TL;DR - trouble managing finances/budget; would like some advice.

personalfinance,[US] Moving to the US - unsure about the insurances,"Hi all,

So I am moving to the US (Silicon Valley) next year. I am planning to stay there for 2-4 years. 

The biggest (remaining) issue I have, is that I am not sure how to insure my wife and myself. I get health insurance from my employer but apart from that I am pretty on my self. My father had a pretty bad accident and therefore I know how freaking expensive such a thing can get. So what if I have an accident and am unable to work? I want to make sure that I am not becoming a bigger burden to my wife than necassary in such an event.

About my economical condition: I am now in my PhD and we started to save some money this year (I know - pretty late), so at the time we move we will have approximately 30'000 USD in cash. I will get a signing bonus but I will probably need that for moving. Furthermore I could (but don't have to) get the money from my pension font since I am leaving the country. But since I am working/paying only for ~4 years, this is only around 35'000 USD (and I am not sure whether it would be a good idea to get that money - but that would be possible and I don't have to decide that now - I can get that money whenever I want). My income will be roughly 11kUSD a month (so probably less than 7'500 if I did the math correctly) and around 3-3.5kUSD will go away for rent (and I would be happy if someone would correct me on that - but flat prices really seem to be that high in the area - I thought about a mortage but the interest rates are nearly four times higher in the US than here - the whole living costs are a kind of a WTF for me - but that is off topic).

IMHO: we are pretty well off but not rich (since I am now only paying less than 8% of my income to taxes and my flat is much cheaper, we are expecting to have less money there despite the higher income). But how would we procede to insure ourself for the worst?

Here at home you usually pay an insurance company monthly and if you die or get sick you get the money. If you don't you will get your money with your pension. How does that work in the US? And if we only live there for &lt;5 years, will the money I payed just be lost as soon as we leave? How much would I have to put in my budget? Where can I find all the information. Does Social Security cover anything? Does my health insurance? Does my health insurance still pay even if I chose to go back home (health care is significantly cheaper at home - so it kind of would make sense I guess)? I could try to talk to an insurance company here at home, but I am not sure whether it is possible to have an insurance policy there while living abroad and I am also not sure whether it is a good idea to pay an insurance in a different currency (I would lose quite some money on each transaction and the insurance costs would be bound to a different currency).

Sorry for the long text - I am alrady pretty nervous since this whole 'leaving everything I know' is pretty new for me.

Thanks in advance for any advice!",finance,1444074947
personalfinance,Ally Bank Security Failure [Update],"TLDR: Their security sucks. 

So I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3n05v0/hi_you_might_recognize_me_as_the_guy_who_is/) post last week, about my extremely poor experience with Ally Bank's security. Thought I would provide an update for those interested, after I talked to someone in their executive relations team. Ill provide a bullet point for each issue, then post what I was told and my thoughts on it.

* Despite having 2-Factor Authentication enabled, I am never prompted for a code, even when logging in via a strange phone in a different state.

*I was told that Ally Bank uses a ""sophisticated"" algorithm to assess when authentication is needed. They cannot disclose how it works (for obvious reason), but rest assured that it is extremely smart*

*I have a hard time believing that it is so sophisticated, if I was able to log in via a strange phone and strange computer, in a different state from which I live, without triggering authentication. (All situations that should trigger a suspicious activity alert). As far as Im concerned, it doesn't work*

* Despite having a custom security verification question/answer set, I am never asked for it during verification.

*They weren't able to explain why I was never asked my security question. The lady kept saying that she cannot tell me what questions they use when someone calls in (such as DOB, SSN, or custom security question). I then asked her if she is then implying that they don't ask the security question 100% of the time, which negates the whole point of it. I didn't get a straight answer about this. So I have no idea.*

* I failed  verification, on a follow-up call, after my DOB seemed to randomly changed on their website (since my correct birthdate authenticated on a previous call).

*I was told that my birthdate was entered wrong when I initially set up my account (more then a year ago), and has been wrong all along. (I'm 99% sure this can't be true, but let's ignore that for now) She then acknowledged that since it has always been wrong, the person that authenticated me on my original call did so despite me giving them an apparently wrong birthdate.*

* After failing verification, I was told my account would be locked from access until my identity was confirmed. I was able to log in and change my password later that day.

*She told me that they didn't lock my account from access (despite me asking specifically for that and being told so by two people), but rather only being locked from any debits being made. Which meant, account info could still be changed. Cool.*

* When Loss Prevention called the next day to verify my identity, they asked for no additional information to verify me (such as a Drivers License), other then the exact same verification questions they asked me the previous day (that I failed on)

*I was told that they used public records to verify that I was giving them the right birthdate. Still seems strange to me that they didn't ask me ANY other additional questions, but ok.*

* This is the most egregious issue for me: I got a final follow-up call from someone in Loss Prevention the next day. The person I spoke to did not do ANY verification at all apart from ""Hi, is this PM_ME_YOUR_TRADRACK?"", then during the course of the phone call told me the answer to my security question.

Recently, we had a close call with financing an expensive issue. We want to get a loan to get a decent amount of money as an emergency fund to pay for any repairs that the tenant will need.  

It's sort of stressful to deal with it with little savings. We are slowly building savings and can pay for regular expenses easily but home repairs are costing us a lot.

He found out that he should have put non-exempt. He went back and submitted a new W-4 with the appropriate corrections. He wants to double with-hold taxes for the next 3 paychecks to make up for the last 3 paychecks' mistakes of not with-holding.

The payroll person responded with this:

You really won't know if you owe the IRS until you file your tax return after the end of the year.  I don't know your full tax situation, so I can't really advise you.  However, if you would feel more comfortable, I can withhold more than otherwise would have been withheld.  I did go back and look at the 3 checks you have received so far.  If you had been claiming Single and 0 exemptions with those checks, your withholding for Federal and California would have been as follows:

Check Dated                Fed W/H            CA W/H
8/31/15                        240.80                58.24

Just so you are aware, if you want me to double your withholding for the next 3 checks, the Federal withholding will then be approximately $481.60 per check; and the California withholding will be approximately $116.48 per check.

Please confirm if this is how you would like this to be handled.

So should he just say ""Yes!"" and go with the double with-holding for the next 3 paychecks to make up for not with-holding for the last 3 paychecks?

Please advise.

I can't see a downside to this, is there one I'm not considering?  Aside from the obvious risk that it will mean I start using my cards again - which I won't - I'm trying to look at this all kinds of ways and it seems like I should at least borrow the $ for the credit card with the 14% interest rate right?

personalfinance,What can I do now to prevent myself from drowning in debt by the time I graduate?,"Hello, first time poster on this sub. I'm 19 and technically in my first year of my graphic design program at college. I transferred from one school in my state to another after deciding to change my major. Its a pretty respectable school in my state and I'm more likely guaranteed a job than with my previous major/school. My dad, scholarships, and money from a pact all covered my expenses last year. This year, he's started to cut me off slowly. I was expecting something like this to happen, especially since I made the decision to live off campus. My rent is $659.50 a month for myself (I live with 2 others), which is incredibly pricey but worked out to be about $2000 cheaper than living at the least expensive dorms on campus. My dad had required me to apply for loans and pay the rent with them. Using my mom's financial information, I was able to get a grant as well. 
I currently have been working for about a month now, but it pays minimum wage and I only work about 15-20 hours a week. I get $300 (currently have $178 left) per semester for on-campus food, but the rest is up to me. I try to limit eating out 1-2 a week. Groceries usually cost me around $25-30 a week. 

Currently, I have about $5000 in my checking account. My bday and Christmas are coming up, so besides a new phone (which is necessary, my current one just shit the bed on me last night), I feel like I should just ask for money to put into my checking account. 
I've also been told by a friend to look into a savings account with high interest.
I'm a complete newbie and I want to start being smart with my money. All of this happened really fast. I just don't want to lose track of my expenses and to understand what I've gotten myself into. I know that my dad would help me out if I really needed him to; he's pretty well-off...but he's worked hard for his money and I think he wants me to gain a sense of responsibility. 

So to break it down, financial aid for my entire 2015-2016 year:

Grants- $6775.00

Federal Perkins Loan- $2000

Subsidized Direct Loan- $3500

Unsubsidized Direct Loan (accrued interest rate of 4.6%)- $2000

I purchased a 2015 Ford Fusion Hybrid with 15,000mi for about $21,500, just back in June. I was making a considerable amount more then, but took a pay cut right after that to come to a better job; where I am now. I can still afford everything, but debt is stacking up and I can't save as much as I want to. 


I haven't lived at home for years (I'm 21), but when visiting the family recently I mentioned to them offhand that I was looking to find a way to save more, by maybe selling my car privately and pocketing the difference to put as a down payment on a cheaper car. They came back yesterday with this: they take over my monthly payments, and I get their older car that's already paid for, a 2007 Honda civic hybrid.

My questions are:

1.) Let's say the car they're giving me is worth $10k. Do I sell it, put $10k down on a newer (~$15k) car, finance the $5k, and have a cheap car payment and a nicer car, while still being able to save? 

2.) Do I keep the car with no payments, and save as much as I can until something else comes up however far from now?

3.) Do I consolidate my higher interest credit card/personal loan debt using the value in the car, and hopefully walk away with a consolidated, lower interest rate, low monthly payment? 

I'm trying to figure out what will work in my favor long term.

As part of the loan forgiveness program, I'm going to have to make 120 non-consecutive loan payments while working full-time. Since it’s a loan forgiveness program, I’m allowed to pay the minimum of $178 a month and I’ve already paid off 24 months of the 120 qualifying payments. However, any payments made while I'm part-time do not count as qualifying payments and I’m thinking about having kids within the next 10 years. 

Here is my current Principal Balance:	$43,204.63	
My Interest Rate is 6.8% and it’s a fixed-rate loan
Unpaid Interest:	$676.22
Total Current Balance:	$43,880.85

I also have a car loan that will be paid off in 3 years at $200 a month. 

If I decided to forego the loan forgiveness program, I could realistically put down $16,000 toward my loans today and still have a nest egg of about $6,000. My current salary is $42,000 before taxes.

Getting to 13 should take about 3 years if everything goes according to plan (advancing 9 -&gt; 11 -&gt; 12 -&gt; 13).

My student loan balance is currently about $27,000 at 6.8% interest. I am currently on IBR with $0 due per month until June 2016 since they used my income during school, which was lower than the loan balance (I also didn't get the job right after graduating and applied for IBR when I was still on the job search). Am I right in thinking that the $0 per month counts as one of the 120 payments? Does it make sense to just stay on IBR (and maybe move to REPAYE when it comes out later this year as it seems to be a better plan) making the minimum payments and then using PSLF to get rid of the remainder of the loan tax free? 

I also don't personally have any other debt (car given to me by parents, pay off credit cards in full every statement, etc).

The main reason why I am asking is that my parents did take out Parent PLUS loans to help pay for my college and that totals something like $70,000. I know that I am not liable for it, but I could help pay off that loan first instead of paying my student loan because of PSLF.",finance,1444090830

personalfinance,"Finance Newbie - have put together a plan, opinions and advice needed.","Hi Everyone

I’ve made the decision to take better control over my finances and start working towards a more secure future, both short and long term – and I’m looking for some advice on my current financial situation, and the plan which I am currently putting together.

As a warning, this post is lengthy…..

TLDR – Scroll down to bottom

Here’s my situation:

Background:

Typical story of inexperience and naivety, I started working and earning – and at the same time I started incurring debt. Eventually after a few years of small pay rises followed by more consumer debt for unnecessary items I went to the bank asking for more money (an extra $20,000) to buy a nice car and a fast motorcycle – and for the first time they refused me. I was earning a good wage, saving nothing, no retirement fund and no savings. Approx $12,000 in debt and not a lot to show for it, the bank suggested I reduce my expenses, start saving money and try again in six months. Instead, I read a little bit about finance, realised where my mindset was wrong and went back a week later to sign up to my countries retirement fund and borrow just enough extra money to buy a cheap runabout car, I then started pouring money into my debt as fast as I could until it was paid off (took about 1 ½ - 2 years).

Around two or three months after I started paying my debt off I made the decision to get a degree, and realised how narrowly I had dodged a bullet, instead of $30,000 + to pay off before I could go and study I only had around $14,000, my money skills were still not great but I paid it off reasonably quickly. 
I’m now 29 years old and I study full time while working part time, I finish my degree halfway through next year and when I do I may return to full time employment or I may apply to sit a one year Masters in Business Management (MBM) which will cost around $12,000. I’m not sure which path I will take yet and still mulling over my options.

I want to get a handle on money now, while my income is still low. When I eventually do start earning real money I’d like to be able to manage it properly, and avoid the mistakes I made the first time around. I’m going to start getting the basics of proper budgeting and investment down now, while my income is low, so when I have real money I don’t blow it all.

Income:
I’m on a student allowance of $250 per week and I also earn the maximum amount I can working part time before my allowance gets deducted – which is $187 per week after tax.

Debt:
I have $15,000 in student loan debt, which I currently do not have to pay back due income from my part time job being under the earning threshold. When I eventually start repaying the loan it will be interest free, unless I move overseas – and then it will be interest free for the first six months after moving, with an interest rate of 5.8% applying afterwards. My loan will also be increased by approximately $3,500 at the beginning of next year, with me completing my degree (which is in Engineering) in June 2016. 
I also have approximately $4,500 in debt from a car accident I was in last year, which I pay off at $25 per week through the court system. There is no interest, and it will be paid off in about 3 years at the current rate (I will likely need to increase repayments when go back to working full time, so in reality it will be paid off sooner).


Savings/Investing/Emergency Fund:

I currently save 4% of wages from my part time job into a retirement scheme which is matched by my employer for the first 3%. I have approximately $12 000 in my retirement account and I’m considering upping my contributions to the maximum which is 8%. On my current income it’s peanuts but it’s still better than nothing.
Two weeks ago I started an account for long term investments and made a deposit. I’ve set up $30 weekly payments into it and it’s sitting at about $130, the account earns 3.75% if I increase the balance by at least $50 per month. The plan is to put money in here until I have enough to purchase some mutual/managed funds (minimum purchases of $250).

I’ve started an emergency fund which has $25 per week put into it, with my income being so low I will likely need to access this account quite often – anything that I can’t afford to buy week to week from my checking account will need to be paid for from this account. It only has $38 in it at the moment.


Expenses:

Expenses are reasonably low, the way I’ve just had everything set up means that weekly I spend $180 on rent, $15 on petrol, $25 on debt from my accident, $25 to my emergency fund, $30 for investing, and around $120 on groceries. This leaves me with roughly $40 per week for entertainment/fun/friends etc. It’s not a lot but I keep myself busy doing things that don’t cost a lot of money, I can socialise without drinking, and my girlfriend earns much more than me and has no problem paying for the majority of our dates. I can still have a fulfilling lifestyle without spending a lot of money.


Current Plan:

I’ve just recently put together a spreadsheet which has the above budget in it and also a page to work out my net worth. It puts me currently at -$7,500. I will update this with a new column every month. After putting this together as a plan and making the decision to start channelling money into investments I discovered that I’m owed tax returns of $1,400, which will come through sometime this week. 

My short-term plan for this week is to use around $500 to pay for a few upcoming bills and maintenance on my motorcycle, use around $100 to go out on a nice date, and use the remaining $900 with $100 from what I have already saved to purchase mutual funds to the amount of $1000 in order to get an investment portfolio started. None of my debt incurs interest so I see no reason to put any money towards it other than what I have to, I want to start some investments and watch my portfolio grow into the future.

Next, my mid-term plan is to keep putting $30 per week into an investment account and $25 into an emergency account. Every couple of months I will purchase more managed funds, while I start to spend a bit of time here and there learning about how investment works. Hopefully by the time I start earning some real coin and have actual money to invest, I’ll be a bit more clued up.

I’ve also started tracking my spending as I do it by plugging it into my phone, just to become a bit more aware of when I am wasting money on crap.

Also, I don’t know what my income will be over the holiday break, and I won’t be getting any student allowance. I’ve applied for both a paid and an unpaid internship and if offered both I would most likely choose the unpaid one due to the potential for greater personal growth and more career options further down the line. The company I work for part time is low on work, so I don’t think I can bank on having full time employment over the xmas break. I may also be three weeks without any income over the xmas downtime, but I still think it’s better to invest what I have now to get the habit started, and if things get really desperate later I can sell the funds. But I’d rather search for work if that happens and try to problem solve my way through it rather than just spend all the money I have just to make it through a small rough patch. We’ll see how things pan out.

Long term is hard to plan for as I have no idea what my income will be over the next few years. I may even consider trying to start my own business sometime soon as I have an idea that I’m extremely passionate about that I’d like to work on, and that could leave me potentially living on a dime for months on end. I may or may not have to do volunteer/pro bono work on it in my spare time first in order to pick up some skills and more experience that I can use to put a plan together. The way things go over the next six months or so will have a big impact on the rest of my life, as there are many different paths open to me right now.



So to cut this lengthy ramble short, with all things considered, is there any advice from you guys?

TLDR/Here’s my main questions:


1)	Are there any glaring holes in my plan of action so far, when looking at it from more experienced eyes?

2)	Buying mutual funds – I think I’m better off starting with these due to inexperience. I can divvy them up as follows: 

30% low return bonds
30% growth fund, local
30% growth fund, international
10% kept in a cash savings account


3)	Any recommendations for forums/communities to join to discuss money and investment, outside of this reddit forum?


4)	What are, in your opinion, the best books and/or web resources for personal finance? I have currently started scrolling through articles on getrichslowly.com and Investopedia.

I also have the book The Richest man in Babylon, other than that I’m a bit of a newbie when it comes to personal finance.

My wife and I (both 26 y/o) both hold jobs making around $43k and $39k/year. Our combined savings is about $20k, give or take (as a life-rule I don't pay attention to money, but I spend very simply, don't drink, drive a motorcycle, etc). We have $0 debt. My money is in a few different accounts and physically hidden around my apartment, and I know I should get around to consolidating it.

Our employer offers benefits: a.) $7,500 forgivable loan ($1.5k/year for 5 years), and b.) special interest rate through partnership with loan company. We get these benefits for buying in an area that the University deems good for gentrification.

Much to my dismay, we are being given about $43k cash to use for the house. After my initial reaction to burn it in an act of defiant independence (sorry venting), I've decided to do my best to use it well as it is a kind gift from people who love me.

This is my last year in college before medical school. I moved back in with my mother and cousin who is doing a graduate degree at my school. My mother was only supposed to live with us temporarily while she waited for a job over seas. She's reluctant to leave the states and managed to postpone leaving several times. Last week she finally bought tickets but this week she again wants to postpone leaving. It has been like this for over four months.
I'm really having trouble living with her. She is a hoarder while I like to throw things away, she wont' let me take out the trash because she wants to look through it to make sure there's nothing she wants. Living with her also involves other things you would expect from a mother: curfews, criticizing my studies, job advice, constant comparison to her friend's children. I know I'm bothering her as well, I am the typical procrastinating college student and can be up until two or three studying, she always stays up as well even if I'm in my room with most of the lights off.

I live in a college town and a unit in a building close to campus is up for sale. It is newish (5-7 years old) and for sale for around $75,000. I would have the cash to pay off the unit in full. I only have ten months left in my town before I go to graduate school. My thoughts were to buy the apartment now, live in it so I can move away from my mother and when I leave for medical school I can rent it out and use the rent as an income. 

Because I anticipate the tuition of medical school to be $30,000-$60,000 a year I know I will be in debt by time I graduate. Should I spend a large chunk of my inheritance now for an income in school or continue to save the large amount of cash to pay for the first few years of school in full?
I think investing in an apartment is a great idea but I know it's probably because I'm so fed up with living with my mother. Any advice would be great!",finance,1444112974

Are dollars funny? Are they motivating? Which kind of value does Congress have the power to regulate?

Also, what does it mean that the congress of USA has the power to regulate values in other countries? They're sovereign arent they? Which of their values or what things about their currencies?

I'm honestly trying to figure out what all these memes and ways the world works actually mean in peoples heads when they say they're selling you something and then you sell it right back but somehow you received less motivation than you lost... because congress has the power to regulate the value of money, that including to take some of it when it moves between us. If that is the behavior of dollars, then I expect something in return and for what I am getting to be clearly explained, such as ""for consuming a fraction of your motivation with other people, we have adjusted other peoples motivation using interest rate equations the following way and it had this effect on their motivation and some of them changed their religion due to this motivation as was bound to happen just by chance eventually but thats the risk you take when regulating peoples values"".

I really hope congress doesnt claim the right to regulate peoples values. I value knowing only things which are true and removing things which are not true from my mind so they dont motivate me by accident. I am therefore concerned when anyone claims the right to regulate value but doesnt say what value is, and all this time people's perception of value has been affected by dollars, but which parts of that were their choice and whic parts were required by law? I want a formal statement from congress of what I must value, what I must be motivated by, and how it by law must affect my other thoughts.

If the people are not satisfied with their answer, then we declare thought war on their system of thought control, which as I understand it we are allowed to think whatever we want, including to be motivated by bitcoin or euros or our favorite tv show. I hope this can be worked out but it seems hopeless if people are not able to define what they are motivated by all the while congress claims the right to regulate their values, and they dont know their values, so nobody can challenge congress as having regulated their values since their values (what they are motivated to cause more of) have been changed by congress regulating values as it said it would.

I seriously think congress has, by accident as it was hundreds of years ago when there was only 1 currency and not much to change about it, granted itself authority and practical ability to legally require people to change what they think is valuable in the world, and on artistic and freedom of thought grounds I am considering a lawsuit of some kind (probably wouldnt work out but someone will challenge these things eventually as cryptocurrencies are a sovereign branch of motivation unable to be regulated even by their creators, and thats why we like them they are not back doors for others to regulate our thoughts). I would happily give up privacy and publish every bitcoin transaction with my name for all to see if it meant other people would realize that government has no authority, and has gained the ability by accident, to regulate thought of any kind, especially what we are motivated to do any more than to obey our laws. In fact, I'd like a constitutional amendment saying just that, people have only the obligation to their government of obeying its laws, not to have their values regulated.

I'm trying to not get angry about this, but its almost like an act of war for someone to make a law that you must think a certain way. My borders have been invaded, the borders of my mind, and systematically other people have fallen into the same paradigm where if I dont allow thoughts to be put into my mind by legal authority of congress to regulate value (or my perception of value of money or what i can buy with it?) then I am a criminal for not paying tax in units of my value. Sorry congress but I will only pay tax in dollars, not my value. Maybe your value, but how would I know what you value. I insist this part of the constitution be clarified in an amendment defining all the unclear words, and any organization which wants to continue to have the peoples support instead of cryptocurrencies would be wise to avoid claims of legal authority to regulate any kind of thought, except maybe plans to do crimes, we can maybe exempt plans connected to banned actions, but it is not a crime to seek new and better ways people can motivate eachother, now that we understand more about how minds work from brain and AI research, and I want to formally challenge congresses claim to authority over my thoughts about the value of dollars. I dont know about you, but I think dollars are worth about half as much as euros or maybe they're worth a million times more, or maybe I'll double my thoughts of their value on weekends. Did I just break the law by thinking things have a different value than authority defines? Did I erase something in my mind authority said is there and I'll be punished if I dont continue to think it?

I call for a protest of the vaguely defined authority of congress to regulate USAmericans thoughts until the kinds of thoughts which are legal and illegal are formally listed. My credit cards think differently than I do about the value of the dollars we have had deals about. My values may change. Theirs seem to follow equations defined by a certain bank adjusting our values.

Why was Silk Road banned and so much effort went into finding it in the hidden networks and arresting those behind it? Because it sold drugs through the mail, and drugs affect peoples thoughts in often unpredictable ways. Its dangerous to change your mind without first considering what change you are doing, and for the same reason for someone else to by law put thoughts into your mind which have, in practice, prevented USAmericans from choosing which groups of people we will talk to and be around, which is a violation of our right to peaceably assemble with eachother. We cant assemble with those who have been told if they value what we have to say more than money then they are a criminal, as congress has the power to regulate value of money. If value of one thing is changed, the value of other things is affected. You cant have everything as your favorite since they would all have less time put into them. When congress regulates your value of money, they regulate your value of me oppositely when I value money less and other systems of motivation more. Since congress has no authority to call people criminals for having a higher opinion of me (which would decrease their value of money), starting to sound like libel but not quite since they skipped saying anything about me and just told people that the 300 million other USAmericans who are honest law abiding puppets of value to value only those who also value what they're told.

I'm not normally one to be interested in any political office, but it seems that if I organized a bunch of people to all run for office in congress, all of who know eachothers position on regulating thought something like I've pointed out here, then if a majority of them were elected, then we could include as payment to USAmericans for electing them (each per state) that there will be separation of church, motivation, and state, meaning they may each receive a free system of motivation worth in total billions of ""dollars"" such as cryptocurrencies or games with neuralnets or try lots of systems of motivation. I hope it doesnt come to that, but the side of society which broke away, those motivated not by the injection of values into their mind by equations calculated by order of congress, but instead motivated by a simple number they all know nobody can change from what they thought it was.

My brain is not within the borders of USA, and I declare sovereignty of my brain as a physical location (possibly different in some of the stringtheory dimensions but not so much in 3d, details) not located in any other country. Others should probably do the same. In our world of ideas spreading and having ideas of their own, it is unavoidable to expand the meaning of location and border, such as websites having no physical location, and my thoughts not being within USA's borders. My body and physical actions of course, but the content of my mind is at the level of negotiation between sovereign countries if one wishes the other to value something more or less. I'm not claiming I'm exempt from any law of USA as my body is here, but I will think whatever I choose, and right now I think a demonstration of some kind is needed on the nature of money and motivation, in the form of helping people commit some thoughtcrime toward connecting cryptocurrency account numbers into something they can use, else a call of monopoly on the card reader tech seems like people would understand why that cant be allowed. Surprise, your perception of value is in that card reader too, or the clerks perception of value, and they have conspired to prevent people from exchanging value the same way they do, without the regulation by congress. If cryptocurrencies continue to be discriminated against, there could be large damages owed, not to those who use cryptocurrencies but to those who were prevented from using them by monopolistic practices based on the authority to regulate our values.

I dont want to cause governments to start looking through the internet trying to destroy cryptocurrencies or at least peoples access to them, but I also cant let these regulations of thought continue without competition.

I invite dollars and all the currencies to a fair competition for my perception of their value, but anyone who threatens me if I dont value them more will find it had the opposite effect, and now I want congress to admit this has happened and either call me a criminal for not thinking things have the values they say or declare it a monopoly crime for anyone to regulate thought without first signing a contract with full knowlege what will be done to their thoughts.

Money is numbers, its math, and I'm a math person. They have no idea how inequipped they are to attack from an economic perspective except in the usual ways of making things so complex that the peoples thoughts which are regulated by congress do not understand those thoughts.

The regulation of peoples values may even be a danger to Earth security as it is likely connected to the acceleration of all countries militarys in an arms race which we are required by law to contribute our perception of value to and not allowed to choose for this arms race to stop.

Its going to stop, gradually I hope, but a military is no match for a system of motivation. I call religious right to not be motivated toward an accelerating arms race, and I want my tax dollars that go toward USA's military to instead be spread evenly between all the militaries because it provokes an arms race for any of them to have more or less power than the others. I'd rather not be in that at all, but if I must support an arms race then I want it balanced.

A country is divided into a few independent entities:
Currency, through which our thoughts about which things are valuable are regulated as required by law.
Laws, which are more or less what people want eachother to do, problem is they dont know what they want.
Military, which exists primarily to avoid the danger of the existence of militaries. These are dangerous to allow to operate without peoples knowlege of what their motivation is taken to do, since an arms race is easy to fly exponentially out of control. I would therefore prefer if the concept of a military and its country be separated so when people stop being motivated as much by fear of other militaries, it would not be an action between one military and another but between those people of those 2 countries. The militaries can keep their equipment and their system of motivation, but I want a separation of branches where the market value of the militaries stands on its own merits compared to the other currencies available which would be for nonmilitary uses in that same country. It is a threat to their power of mind control that people could then choose based on their own thoughts how many dollars they would trade to a military for their local currency, as that is my perception of their value and I'll not have it taking everyone along for their mindcontrol war, only the soldiers who chose it. I'm not saying militaries are without practical purpose, but when they started refusing to tell the world what we are paying for, all secrets for its too dangerous for anyone else to know, they left our group and became independent. Any group which chooses their privacy but still wants me to pay my perception of the value of dollars for them to do things, which I dont know what they are, will have to do more than threaten me to get my perception of that value which is now not so stable and I'm looking for replacements.

All these organizations are keeping a disturbingly large amount of secrets while still demanding things from us, and they're making me think they cant handle their job to protect people from real dangers other than as created by them.

Going forward, I think I should require a bill listing services I'm asked to pay for, and all such services must be verifiable by others. For example, things not listed for national security reasons (what did we buy in military or spy on internet with your perception of value) in my opinion do not exist because they have claimed no or less services provided than billed for.

As a practical need of people to negotiate with their government, a list of services provided and cost of each is needed, because otherwise only 1 thing can be said and is generally about the whole amount.

Also, we shouldnt be paying more or less taxes for our actions since those are not services provided. Why would I pay myself to do something?",cryptocurrency,1444117848

personalfinance,Please double-check my student loan repayment plan,"I'll start with the basics...

* Dual-income, no kids, cheap cost of living in the midwest
* Combined income of ~$100k
* We rent an apartment for ~$900/mo. Very few other bills beyond your basics: utilities, internet (no cable), phones,  netflix/hulu, food for us and our dog
* Currently ~$77k in student loans, which *might* go up to close to $90k before graduation (final year of school is currently underway)
* None of the loan balance is due until August of 2016 (still in school until then)
* Absolutely no other debt. No car payments, zero credit card balances.
* We already have a large amount of liquid cash saved up for an emergency fund or whatever else we may need it for, around $35k as of right now
* I have a retirement account that I started very young which has a &gt; $60k balance 
* I dropped out of college and started working very young, all the student loan debt is my wife's
* Until this year we've been living almost entirely off my income. My wife was fortunate enough to get a paid internship for the final year of her program, so just a few months ago her income went from ~$10k to ~$42k. This is included on the ~$100k combined income. So just recently we're making more money than ever and the extra income still doesn't feel real. She's only received a few pay checks thus far.


So here's what we're thinking...

We have no plans to let lifestyle inflation occur. We plan to continue living exactly how we do, and focus our combined income on paying the student loans as quickly as possible. 

The large student loan balance is broken up into numerous smaller loans. All of them are Direct Loans, about half subsidized and half un-subsidized. (ok there is *one* private loan through our bank with a $10k balance, but all the rest are Direct loans) The balances vary from $2.5k to $10k, interest rates vary from 3.4% to 6.8% (most are in the 5-6.8 range), and there are about 12 loans total.

My wife works at a school, so I've been told we are eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, but after looking into it a bit I don't think it sounds like a good option for us. I was told we could consolidate all the federal loans, probably wind up with a lower payment and a much longer repayment term, and after 10 years the remaining balance would be forgiven. However, I just don't think these numbers work out well for us. We'd still pay a sizable amount of money in those 10 years, and the interest would be insane due to the longer term, plus we'd still pay heavy income taxes on the forgiven balance after 10 years. The payments on the standard plan without changing our loan structure at all is well within our means, and we plan to greatly exceed that amount and pay them off early anyway.

Does anybody have any thoughts on loan forgiveness versus just buckling down and paying them off as quickly as possible? We really value just getting out of debt quickly, because the long term goal is to be debt free and own a home. I'd really rather not have a student loan payment *and* a mortgage unless the forgiveness route really works out in our favor. Especially since the debt only lowers our home purchasing power (not that we plan on buying a crazy expensive house, we just hate debt).

If we go the route of just paying the loans off as quickly as possible, my understanding is that we want to target the un-subsidized loans first, because those are accruing interest right now while the subsidized ones are not. Probably want to target that one private loan too, depending on the interest rate. So basically, un-sub and private first, subsidized last, go in order of greatest to least interest rate. That sound about right?

Here's another question: since my wife is still in school until August of next year but is fortunate enough to already have a real income, would we be better served by starting to make payments on the loans right now before anything is actually due? Or would we be better off just saving up a big pile of money to throw at the loans once they actually become due? Does direct loans offer discounts to people who are willing to just throw down a huge pile of cash to pay off loans quickly? 

Does any of this plan make sense? We have tried extremely hard to save money and live modestly and I think we've done a good job, we just value advice when it comes to the fine details of repayment now that it's actually coming down to crunch time.

investing,Paul Tudor Jones sees choppier markets.,"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-05/paul-tudor-jones-sees-choppier-markets-amid-fed-paradigm-shift

Paul Tudor Jones, the founder of Tudor Investment Corp., said he expects markets to be choppier as the Federal Reserve for the first time in decades focuses on managing debt, rather than steering local economic developments.

While the Fed in the past would have reacted to signs of a slowdown by easing, the central bank is realizing that there’s a “tail risk” tied to having interest rates near zero, Jones said in a television interview Monday on ""Bloomberg &lt;GO&gt;"" with David Westin and Stephanie Ruhle.

“Now I think for the first time since Volcker probably you see the Fed managing for the balance sheet, to take out the tail risk associated with expanding debt virtually globally, and not to mention our federal debt,” Jones said. That “points to a choppier market.”

Marc Lasry, the billionaire co-founder of Avenue Capital Group, said on the same program that the Fed needs to raise rates sooner rather than later. The U.S. economy is ""doing great"" compared with the rest of the world and doesn’t need more stimulus from the central bank, he said.

""Having more stimulus isn’t what we need,"" Lasry said. ""You need to get back to a little more normality.""

Lasry said the U.S. is the best place to invest in equities, while he sees distressed opportunities in Europe and Asia. After oil prices have plunged, the hedge fund manager said, energy has become a phenomenal opportunity and he has bought a ""bunch"" of energy names.

Bill Gross, who runs the $1.4 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, said zero-percent interest rates are hurting savers and the Fed needs to raise them to restore a more balanced economy.

""I think you need higher interest rates,"" Gross said in an interview today on
Bloomberg Radio. ""Capitalism will not thrive at zero percent.""

personalfinance,[Housing] Underwater Mortgage Refinance Options,"I posted this on the Moronic Monday thread but didn't get any responses so I'm going to try as a separate discussion.

My main issue is that I have a mortgage with my ex-wife's name on it that I need to have her taken off. It should have been already done but I haven't been able to get refinancing or an assumption under any program and so I'm always at risk of her forcing a sale or doing something although it probably helps her credit score.
My trifecta of problems getting a refinance are as follows:

1-My mortgage is underwater. It's currently at 104k on a home worth somewhere around 80k.

2-It is not owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. No, it's not. Even though EVERY time I contact a bank or program for help they try to convince me Fannie and Freddie own pretty much EVERYTHING and just because their not the servicer they may still own it. They don't. It's currently serviced by Select Portfolio. The original owner was First Franklin, to Bank of America, and now it's Wells Fargo as trustee for First Franklin although they never seem to be able to find it when I call probably because it's not actually their loan?

3-I'm not in danger of forclosure. I have a really crappy mortgage, it's a 9.125% adjustable rate. But I didn't go into it completely stupid. Just sorta stupid. So after my divorce I slowly paid off my credit cards (I still use Discover but pay in full every month) and started paying extra on my mortgage. I was doing double ($2000 on a $1000 monthly payment) although I'm cutting back to $1500 because it was getting a little tighter than I was comfortable with.

I don't qualify for HARP or any program whenever I talk to banks or ""Save your Home"" groups. It gets real frustrating so I tend to just go to a bank every few months and ask them if there's anything new they can offer. When they hear the interest rate they're always positive they can help....then they can't. Personally, I'd be fine with another mortgage at the same rate and everything. I can pay 9.125%, I just want my ex off the mortgage but I'm stuck. :( Any ideas?",finance,1444151878

I make around $700-$800 a week from it and currently my payments are coming in 2 forms: direct deposit into my checking account, and into my PayPal (I accept both forms of payment).  

I have a PayPal Business Debit Card and I use it mostly for personal things (groceries, gas, etc.) and occasionally for business use. I sell digital downloads so I don't have many expenses.

I also use Self-Employed Quickbooks to keep track of my income and expenses.  I plan on filing my quarterly taxes this January.  It's my first time doing it so I'm a bit nervous and hope that I'm doing everything correctly.

Can you please give me advice on how I can better keep track of my money, and how I should be saving it? I really need to start saving for my taxes in January because it looks like I will probably owe at least $1,000 and I have NO savings.  It's an issue. :(

personalfinance,Lowering loans payments. So. Many. Questions.,"I have private student loans and federal student loans. I have been in repayment for 11 months now.
My private student loans currently total $37,997 with interest rates ranging from 8.38% to 9.38%.
My fed student loans currently total $25,230 with interest rates ranging from 3.15% to 6.55%.
My monthly loan payment towards both is about $850. I am still living within my means so I'm not looking into anything like deferment or bankruptcy.

So throughout my desperate trek to lower my payments and still pay them off before retirement I have found more questions than I have answered. 

What is a FICO credit score? Do all companies use this score? Mine is 656, I see this is just fairly good, but not great. 

I can release my cosigner from my private loans which *may* lower my interest rate.
Should I refinance? Release my cosigner? Just wait until my FICO score gets better? Wait til I win the lottery, pay off my loans and give each of you that comments $3,000? 
Are there other options?

Edit: when I applied for these student loans I had no credit history and only one option for a cosigner, whose credit was pretty rough at the time",finance,1444157632

But for the life of me I can't find any information about dividends generated by the investment. Are they also tax free? What about capital gains? I've seen other posters state that both are taxable so I am a bit confused. What is and isn't taxable?",finance,1444158479

personalfinance,Should I get a loan to pay off my balance with IRS?,"Long story short, I owe the IRS about $3000.

I set-up a payment extension with them to pay it off within 120 days.
But then I had an idea:

I have no credit, because I have never made payments on a cc or loan.

Is it reasonable to apply for a small loan ($1000 or a little more) to apply toward the taxes, and simultaneously build credit while paying back the loan?

I wonder if i will even qualify with a half-decent interest rate because of my history.

Any thoughts would be appreciated!

personalfinance,"Should I back out of an interview? Also, general career advice. I'm not sure who else to ask...","Long story short, I work at a large University in a smaller department (as a staff/administrator, not a professor). I like my job, hate my boss with a passion of a thousand suns and make decent money ($53kish in a low cost of living area).

I've become relatively well-known and liked both within and beyond my unit, and was recently encouraged to apply to a position that would constitute a tremendous increase in title and salary outside my unit, despite the fact that I'm quite young and have only been here for a couple of years. I had a phone interview today, and it went... awful. 

I can't say why it happened, I'm great at interviews and great at public speaking, but I was embarrassingly awful. I stuttered, I rambled, my answers were terrible, and for the life of me I don't know why. I'm a confident, well-educated, well-spoken guy. I just choked. I actually apologized at one point and admitted that it was the first phone interview I'd done and I felt a bit flustered, which was probably an awful thing to say in and of itself. It was comedically bad. I hung up and said out loud to myself ""What the fuck is wrong with me?""

I learned right after from an HR friend I told about it, trying to get put it behind me and laugh about the situation even though I'm crushed and incredibly disappointed in myself, that it's University policy that I would interviewed anyways since I was internal, regardless of how the phone interview went 

I think I'm embarrassed more than anything, but I almost think I should back out of what is essentially a mandatory, pity interview. I was so strongly recommended by all these higher-ups, got letters of recommendation from some very important people where they talked about how great I was and then acted like an nervous idiot. Has anyone else just completed bombed an interview like that and recovered (gracefully)? If I go into the full interview and kill it, will they forget how awful I was?

Obviously having a reliable exchange will be a huge step forward, but I'm guessing part of the reason it was approved by US state and federal regulators is because it agreed to report shady activity and keep thorough records of transactions in case law enforcement needs them, just like regular banks must. I don't know the law or the intricacies of bitcoin anonymity, but is this accurate? It seems a glaring omission to me that Gemini has not addressed this issue publicly as they prepare to launch.

I've done web development full time for years remotely, but got laid off at the start of April 2015, and have been struggling to [find regular work since](http://cv.tn42.com). Wife is attempting to build some kind of income through substitute teaching at a local preschool and selling cosmetics, but it's a drop in the bucket with a $600 car payment and $2500 mortgage every month (plus another ~$1k in bills). Also we owe at least $9k in taxes/fees for previous years freelancing. I work hard to give back to the open source community and help out with my [oldest daughter's projects](http://sylviashow.com), but these don't generate any kind of appreciable income. 

What little work I've been able to fill time with has been too little too late and we've been sent official foreclosure notices and the collection calls are constant. We struggle to manage car upkeep, and have ""borrowed"" _far too much_ from my parents and friends just to be able to buy gas and food for the kids. I apparently have ~$13.8k in one, 401k, and another with ~$2.7k in it. Every time I've talked to the management companies, they try to talk me out of cashing out as much as possible, ass apparently it's not usually worth it as the penalties of cashing out are huge.

What I really worry is that by taking this money that's meant for my retirement, and _completely depleting it_, I'm not really buying myself much more than a little over a month, and even then we could lose the house or make our awful credit score even worse in the time it could take for a job to pay me enough to catch up again.

personalfinance,Paying off debt with much needed savings before turning around and taking out loan to replace savings?,"I have about 9 credit cards with pretty high interest rates (averaging between 13-23%...I know, I know) and no annual fees.

In savings I have about $10k, which I really need to help with my move and to secure an apartment in a new city as I start toward my college degree on the GI Bill.

Would it be a sound move to pay off the 9 credit cards to a zero balance using my savings and then perhaps secure a loan with much lower interest rates to replenish my account?
Also, in theory, would this raise my credit score at all? I currently have no other debts outside of these credit cards. I imagine leaving them open with a zero balance would be more beneficial to my score?

personalfinance,Is it ever okay to take out a loan on your 401(k)?,"I'm 27yo and have approximately 14k in my 401(k) after 3 years at my job. I contribute 4% automatically while my job contributes 6% (maximum amt). While in nursing school, I took out a credit card to pay for my books, scrubs, and other necessities for school. Right now it is around 90% maxed out with a balance of $4900 with an annual interest rate of 24.99%. I'm paying $156 a month and I've barely made a dent in it. I know it's affecting my credit because of the high credit utilization. And even though I would love to pay more than this per month on my credit card at this point in my life I really can't swing it with all of my student loan payments as well. 

I was always taught by my parents to NEVER touch your 401(k) so even thinking about it makes me anxious. However, after using the loan calculator on my 401(k) provider's website I found that I can take a $4800 dollar loan and essentially pay off my credit card. It would be a 7% interest rate I would be paying back to myself and it would be paid off in biweekly payments of $69 for 3 years. I could choose up to 5 years and have payments as low as $40 but I would rather have it paid off sooner than later.

So would this be a good idea for me? It would take care of my credit card debt, taking care of the 'high credit utilization' mark on my credit score and help increase my total credit score overall, and I would not be essentially throwing away the 24.99% interest rate I'm paying right now. I'm just skeptical because of the fear of even touching my 401(k). Any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1444175874

Bitcoin,Does it Concern Anyone Else that a Lot of the Rest of the World Views this Community as Bat-Shit Crazy?,"Before I begin I'd like to mention that I have been involved in Bitcoin since before the mayhem at the end of 2013. I play an active role in the Bitcoin community and economy, and I have the utmost faith that Bitcoin is bound for success in the future.

Now, with that out of the way, everyone I've talked to thoroughly with about Bitcoin has, after doing some research on their own, come to the conclusion that this community is absolutely crazy, and I don't blame them. For context, these are techy people who are also redditors, who check out /r/bitcoin to find a display of rants about government and banks, chants of an impending moon, discussion about changing the system. It's too much for the average person to tolerate, and I personally wouldn't expect anyone to invest in something with knowledge that this is the atmosphere surrounding it.

There is no need to sugar coat it. The popular political beliefs and ideologies around here are extreme. So  extreme, that I would argue it turns away the general population, and creates a bad image to the rest of the world. The world isn't ready to eliminate banks, abolish governments, and deconstruct laws.

Unfortunately, the current atmosphere surrounding Bitcoin means that for this fabled mass adoption to take place, the masses need to adopt these beliefs. This is not a good scenario, as there are plausible and tangible uses to legitimize Bitcoin for said adoption, and there is no reason not to hold these facts as more important than the possible extreme political implications down the road.

Furthermore, the public perception of Bitcoin is poor. Everyone that I have talked to (and I am of the younger demographics, so a lot of my peers are familiar) that is familiar with Bitcoin, every single person, initially responds negatively. ""Oh, isn't that the internet drug money?"" ""It's that weird internet money that crazy people use?"" ""Didn't it crash after that drug ring got busted?"" Not a single person that I know in real life has initially responded to Bitcoin as something that can benefit the general population, or improve existing entities, etc.

In addition, I know a handful of people who are interested in Bitcoin, understand it's potential uses, and think it could have a positive impact down the road, who don't invest simply because they don't trust the environment it's raised in.

I know this post is starting to ramble on, and I'm not tying together points too well. Here is the point I am trying to make. Bitcoin is much, much more likely to flourish in an environment that average people can feel comfortable in. What is the benefit of waiting for some tragic event to take place? What did Greece do for Bitcoin? Our exchanges are less secure than the banks in most developed countries. Hell, my USD are federally insured.

We will never see any serious adoption take place while the most upvoted posts on this sub curse the banking system and governments. The extremist group found in Bitcoin represents and extreme minority in the general population, and if we keep catering to such a small minority, it will be really hard to see anything truly revolutionary take place in a positive manner.",cryptocurrency,1444176503

* Towards smarter nuclear export controls

It is time to review and improve the functioning of nuclear export controls by introducing a risk-based approach and by providing guidance that will help small companies especially understand and deliver on their obligations, writes Sandro Zero.

A little over ten years ago the United Nations Security Council resolved to enhance international cooperation in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology and other types of WMD (weapons of mass destruction) through illicit trafficking along supply chains. That resolution called on governments to maintain appropriate and effective export controls and to work with industry to prevent illicit trafficking.

The resolution also acknowledged that preventing proliferation should not hamper international cooperation for peaceful purposes but the complexity of the regulations makes it difficult for exporters to comply and distorts trade in nuclear components and materials and in the transfer of technology.

personalfinance,Should I take a higher paying job even though the commute is way worse?,"Hey guys, so here's the story:

I graduated May of '14 with a degree in Medical Technology with 0 loans.  I accepted a 30 hr/week second shift job right when I graduated at a hospital that is about 15 minutes from my house, at $35k a year ($23 an hour, though I tend to work more than 30 hours a week, I logged 96 hours on my last paycheck).  I live in MA (right on the border of NH). NH historically pays less than MA does in my field, but I do enjoy where I work even though the pay is lower than I could expect to make in MA.  

So, I live with my boyfriend in a condo that is owned by my mother.  We pay all of the expenses (~1100 a month, we're fairly frugal and we don't blast the AC or the heat or anything) split down the middle.  He commutes into Boston for his job ($45k a year) by taking the train.  I've been wanting to switch onto day shift for a while now, which my supervisors know, but there aren't any openings and won't be for a while. Second shift (3-11pm) gets a nice shift differential of $1.50 an hour but it isn't worth how infrequently I see my boyfriend or any of my friends, I feel very isolated socially.  I interviewed for and was offered a full time, day shift job at a major hospital in Boston.  The offer was $27.50 an hour (~ 57k a year).  

I'm weighing my pros and cons here and would love some outside opinion. Should I leave my job that pays less, but the commute is borderline nothing, to a job that pays better/possibly has a higher ceiling/looks awesome on my resume but I have to commute 2 hours a day?  (And if I choose not to drive, which I have a V6 Escape so I probably won't, the train will cost ~300$ a month).  

Expenses per month-
Rent: 550/month give or take 50$ depending on AC/heat that month
Car payment: 268 (I pay $310)
Car insurance:90
Phone: 90
Gas: Right now only ~120 a month or so
Horse's board (I know, I know, selling her is on the horizon) : $500 
Food: $200
Netflix: $7

Opinions? Working in Boston would be AMAZING. I know I'd learn so much, but I can't tell if the added expense to the commute ruins it.  It turns my 57k offer for a 8 hr/day 5 day/week to a 10 hr/day.

personalfinance,Is it better to get a 15year or 30year mortgage (fixed rates) and pay it early - for an investment property?,"Just reading a similar subreddit for the owner-occupier house scenario. There, most favored the 30-year's flexibility for saving/investing with higher returns and liquidity. But what about an investment property? In this situation, the interest is not tax-deductible (U.S.). There is also the strategy of negative gearing and deducting losses against taxable income, while the value of the home increases over time. 

My situation is that I refinanced my rental home (bought as  residence, became rental) to a 15yr mortgage a couple of years ago (from 30yr, had 25 to go). Reduced the interest rate to 3.25% from 4.75% (I don't remember now what my 30 year % option was at the time). Rents go up a bit every year or two.  I operated at a modest loss  for 2 years (~$200/mo), now I'm just breaking even barring big repairs, and I'll probably be firmly in the black in another 2-3 years.  Losses have offset any taxable investment taxes this past few years, but that will change in a couple of years when rents go up again. Did I do the right thing?",finance,1444183752

personalfinance,Help someone unqualified to manage parent's increasing debt.,"Parents has been hiding an ever increasing debt from all the kids, so I decided to help curve their issue before it becomes worst. Title should be increasing credit balance woops*

There is about a $6000 credit card balance on my parent's American Express card (7 years development). Their current APR is about 15% percent and the expected minimum payment is about $142. Interest charged is about $80. The situation is that they pay about $700 each period, but the amount charged each month surpasses the amount paid to the credit balance.

My situation: I have taken up all their billing statements and monitor what purchases has been going on (very obvious that charges surpasses payment). I am attempting to manage a budget for them to keep payments above the charges. 

Although I don't have too much understanding of all of this, this is my first hand experience with money so it will be useful in the future.Now my questions. Is the interest charged monthly a residual interest resulting from a lack of paying off in full? Also would APR applies towards the final balance at the end of the year or cumulative of each period? Would accepting a lower interest rate loan to pay off the debt fully be a better opportunity? (Paying monthly payments wouldn't be as much of an issue if they had reasons to show some restraint)

Do you guys have any recommendations as well?

personalfinance,"Family member has a CC in my name that I didn't know about, 2nd time this has happened in last 5 years, what do I do?","I'll try to keep it short. While growing up, my dad had a few CCs in my name to build up my credit as he put it, which was nice because my credit score was pretty awesome in my early 20s while other ppl didn't have any credit. But I told him once I finished college that I didn't want him doing that any more because I wanted to control all my finances.

Fast forward about a year, and I found that he had opened up a CC in my name through Wells Fargo, which I only found out about when I tried to close out my account with my student loans after paying them off (yay) and they asked if I wanted to pay off the balance on my CC and close that as well. Since this was a shock to me, I pretty much flipped my shit and threatened him with fraud if he did it ever again because I'm not a child any more and just because he has my info gives him no right to use a CC in my name without my knowledge or permission. He said okay, gave me the card, hadn't wrecked my credit or anything like that, not really sure what the intent was since he didn't need the money and my credit was already good.

That was 3-4 years ago now, fast forward to today where I'm logging into Chase to pay off my CC in full like I do every month and I see another CC on my account that I don't recognize with a $5k limit, a $3990 balance, $200 payments the last 3 months, and most of the charges coming from about a year ago save for some charges earlier this year. I can't reach him right now, but I'm pretty pissed. I can't think of a logical explanation why he'd have this, and feel even more strongly that it was kept a secret from me and I'm only finding out about it because it's showing now on my main Chase account when I log in. There's no charges in the last 6 months, and looks like no interest rate so guessing it's interest free for 6 months or something similar. I don't think he has money problems but maybe I'm wrong and he's too proud to talk to me about it. Either way, I don't want to spend the rest of my life checking my accounts every few months to make sure familiar members that I trust haven't opened an account in my name with my info without telling me. What do I do? What's a reasonable response with this being the 2nd time it's happened after I already said never again? We have a good relationship so this is a pretty big surprise to me honestly.

NOTE: Yes I know that I can pull a free credit report once a year each with the big 3 and hadn't done it since the card was opened, so more than a year, and should be doing that regularly to avoid shit like this.",finance,1444196666

personalfinance,"31, WAY overeducated, and bracing for an impending career change -- how best to prepare now?","I'm currently in the first of two contractually obligated years of a postdoctoral fellowship in molecular biology. This is nominally a ""training"" (ha) position designed to prepare trainees for tenure-track faculty positions at research-oriented institutions. I had a recent come-to-Jesus epiphany that tenure-track positions, if not academic positions generally are not something I'm interested in; I'm also extremely unhappy in my current position but can't leave. The terms of my fellowship contract stipulate that the first twelve months are essentially a loan for roughly $55k that can be paid back by an additional 12 months of ""service,"" which is most easily discharged by being a postdoc for another 12 months. 

I have 16 months to go until I'm finished with this postdoc, at which point I would really like to take a substantial amount of time off and figure out what I'm doing with my life -- by the time I'm finished, I'll have spent almost 12 years either as a PhD student or a postdoc. I'm not terribly worried about finding a job, but I am concerned about finding a GOOD job, which is why some relatively low-intensity time would be useful. 

I currently get paid $3700/month, but because of how my income is classified, no taxes are withheld and I'm responsible for paying both federal and California estimated quarterly taxes. In four months, I'll get a bump to ~$48k/year that will last until the end of my postdoc. 

Here's my current monthly budget:  
$430/month contribution to a pre-tax 457(b) retirement account  
$700/month contribution to a Roth IRA until maxed ($5500/year), then this gets rolled into...   
$950/month (expanded to $1650 after Roth max) to e-fund/tax fund (I estimate that I owe ~$3800 federal and ~$1700 California income tax, both of which I pay quarterly)  

$700/month rent  
$400/month food (both prepared at home and ordered)  
~$300/month fun (quite variable, sometimes more, sometimes less; also includes gas because I fill my tank maybe twice every three months)  
$75/month   car insurance  
$50/month   utilities  
$80/month   gym  
$15/month   phone plan  

I spent the first six months of this year aggressively getting my debt to zero and then traveling a lot, so I've been on this budget for the last two months. I currently have ~$1500 in my emergency fund, $13k in my Roth, and $12k distributed across a few pre-tax retirement accounts. 

By the time I finish my postdoc, I'd like to have at least six months' expenses in my emergency fund (so, ~$10k), which I should be on pace to do. 

I'm not sure how long I'll be taking off after my postdoc (nor how long is ""safe"" to take off), so I'm also not sure if I'm budgeting correctly. I assume that my ""fun"" budget will all be directed towards health insurance when I'm no longer a postdoc, fixing my monthly expenses at approximately $1700. 

Am I directing my saving contributions correctly? Should I be putting as much as I am in pre-tax retirement accounts knowing that I might need it sooner rather than later? Is it worth maxing a Roth every year in my situation? Should I be saving even more? 

Is there anything I've missed? Any feedback would be appreciated!",finance,1444200582

personalfinance,Mortgage modification restarting my mortgage?,"So I'll try to make this short. I had a good job with the phone company as a phone tech (company name starts with a V) and in 2011 I bought my first house. little three bedroom ranch. Corner lot. Things were going well. Not very long after, the company closes the department and lays 336 of us in the state off. So I'm collecting unemployment and my wife (fiance at the time) was working as a hair stylist and barely making any money. I was making more on unemployment than she was in comission. Anywho, neither was enough to pay the mortgage and I couldn't find work in my area that paid me more than unemployment (550 a week). So months go by and I cash out my 401 to keep the house and so on. A few random jobs in between and now I have a decent job with lots of overtime and my wife is making a Lil more money doing hair. I still can't catch up on those payments I've missed. It was about 6 grand they wanted to make the account current.

 So I called my mortgage company like two weeks ago and they set up a modified payment plan for me. I don't quite understand all the exact details but they said I will have 3 payments the next three months that are about 100 bucks less that my original payments. Once I've paid these, my 30 year mortgage a will start over and they will calculate a new payment for me based on 3.75 interest rate (originally4.75). And that 6 grand will just be put on the back end of my mortgage.  My question is if this is real bad for me. It sounds crazy to me that my mortgage will start over from day one and the payments that I did make in the beginning there were pretty much for nothing?

personalfinance,Thinking about increasing risk.,"So I'm new to the stock/fund thing. I have a little bit of money that I'm looking to invest for the long-term (10 years minimum). My first foray into this type of thing was piggybacking on my dad's account with some investment firm, where he pays some rate to them and gets access to a bunch of different funds. I dumped what I had into the same place he had most of his money because at this point I know literally nothing. 

The fund is what I'd now consider to be low-medium risk, comprised of 30% government bonds, 5% private bonds 36% of what I understand to be mortgages (This might be completely wrong) and 25% domestic stock (Iceland)

Because the Icelandic stock market is having a very strong year (All stock-based funds are up 40-50% year over year) this fund has had a very nice return of 19% the past 12 months. 

But now, being a greedy naive young person I can't help but think that since my situation is quite different from my dad's, and my tolerance for risk much higher, I should maybe move my investments over to a higher risk/reward situation. 

The fund I'm looking at now is 75% domestic stock (Insanely volatile in Iceland - I mean seriously nuts) 10% foreign stocks 10% private bonds and some other crap. 

The crazy thing is, this fund has had absurd returns for a long time and never really had a very scary down turn in its 19 year history. [Since november first 1996 the total return is 1035% as of today](http://i.imgur.com/to1ll5k.png). Which sounds absolutely unsustainable but there it is, even the 2008 crash - Which as all of you probably know decimated the Icelandic market  - doesn't appear to have made a very serious impact. 

[Here is a competitor firms premier stock fund over roughly the same time period.](http://i.imgur.com/hkRhTE7.png)
This isn't really relevant but to me it speaks volumes about the competency of the people running the firm (Perhaps it's stupid of me to think there is any real skill involved?)

But really my question boils down to this, how is it possible to average 50% returns for such a long time? Interest rates in Iceland are higher than the US for sure (checking accounts get 2-3% and savings accounts can get up to 5-6) but we haven't even had such bad inflation [Here are some numbers on Iceland's inflation from www.inflation.eu](http://i.imgur.com/JtfZnz6.png)

However, my oldest account is only 4 years old, so the newer accounts really have an impact on my age of credit line, because it's averaged. If I close some of the accounts with lower limits, will that increase my age of accounts, or will it still be factored in?

We are looking at making some bulk payments (about $10k at a time) throughout the next few years.  Our big debate is deciding between these two options:

1. Pay off one person's loan first, while only making minimum payments on the other's.  This is appealing because once one of our loans is paid off, our monthly payment will be cut in half.  It will be nice to have that extra money every month to put into savings.  But I don't know how much extra we will pay in interest this way.
2. Pay off the highest interest parts of each of our loans first.  The benefit here is decreasing the amount paid towards interest.  However, we will be making bulk payments but still have a high minimum monthly payment until both loans are paid in full.  My concern is that this doesn't leave us as much of a safety net.

As an added twist: should we be setting aside money for a down payment now, or wait until our student loans are totally paid off before we start saving for a house?

Our situation:
- $20k EACH in student loans, with several loans of varying interest rates from 3.5-6.5%.
- Consistent $1000/month that we have been putting into savings.
- We have 2 car loans, rent a townhouse, and want to buy a house once both our loans are paid off.

personalfinance,Advice on how to approach purchase of mobile home (US),"My first ever post.

I am 48 yrs old and have made an offer on a very nice mobile home at the beach (Delaware) which will be my primary residence after most of a life renting. The offer (very likely to be accepted) is 19k. The unit is very nice in a very solid and well run community and a great deal for the condition and extra space.

I am not a person who has made much money in his life. One the one hand, I currently have maybe 1k in the bank and make a wage of 14/hr (I work 60 hr weeks and I will be doing my job remotely with no problem from my boss - my job is very secure). I enjoy my work and do not expect to make a lot of money at it. I also have a side income of $150 a month and car payment, but no health insurance (something I'd like to change soon)

On the  other hand  I've just completed paying off my student loan and have been consistently making payments on my new car since 2011. I'm unsure of my credit score but expect it would not be bad (I have a very small credit card which I keep on top of and rarely use). Most importantly - due to a death in the family, I have a nest egg of roughly 80K which I have invested in fairly non-volatile stocks through a trusted financial manager.

I was hoping to get a loan of some kind with a plan to pay it off in five years. As the unit is from 1969, it will not be acceptable for the banks who do mobile home loans as their general cut-off age date is 1975, and as a homeowner's loan will not legally apply to a mobile home - although this is not a mobile home on wheels but a unit, I will not own the land and will be paying rent (theoretically I could ""move the unit"" if I wanted to but that is rarely done and probably would be expensive). My Bank of 10 years, BANK OF AMERICA, does not do personal loans. I have been informed that only TD Bank, Capital One Bank and Discover bank do personal loans and that depending on your credit score they can charge an interest rate between 3.9% up to 29%. I also have the option of taking some or all of the cost out of my 80K in investments and just making the purchase myself (and probably setting myself up to ""pay the loan back to myself"" in monthly payments back into the investments).

I'm planning on talking to all three banks this week and asking for rates for a 5-year repay on 20K (full amount and moving costs), 15K (with me paying 5k), 10k (with me paying 10K) and 5K (with me paying 15k). As I said, my job is very secure and I should have fairly solid credit, and the security of the nest egg (my investments are very conservative) to be back me up.

I realize there are probably all kinds of details I have left out but does anyone have any advice as to what approach may make the most sense or what to expect or what to think to ask?  Personally, I'd rather not pull the money out of investments but perhaps that makes the most sense? Or does splitting it make more sense? Obviously, the offered rates could make all the difference but I have absolutely no experience with this.  Any help or suggestions at all would be appreciated, and I will answer any questions.",finance,1444249897

personalfinance,A Question on Student Loans,"I was recently offered by a family friend the option to have them immediately pay off ~$23,000 of my student loans (all federal loans). Of course, they said they would have me sign a promissory note to them to pay them back $24,000 in 3 years, when I receive a settlement at age 25 that is worth around $60,000. I know that I should be wary of borrowing money from someone in my personal life, but it seems that I would save some money that would otherwise go to interest payments, and also I know that I am 100% good for the money as I just have to wait to turn 25 to get them their money back, which is something that they know.  Are there any tax implications to paying back all of my loans immediately? Does this seem like the right move to make? Any feedback would be most welcome, thank you",finance,1444251756
personalfinance,Payoff car loan early or let it ride out?,"Back in my early mid-life crisis, I bought a brand new vehicle.  My credit wasn't very established at the time but I really wanted the car.  I traded in my vehicle that I had at the time, which had an upside-down loan.  After it was all said and done, I was financed for 72 months at 6% APR. (Around $31,000ish [The car msrp'd for around $22,000ish] for the loan to carry - I wasn't very financially smart at the time as I was in my early 20's and only saw the car and didn't read the contract).  Fast forward a year and a half, I've paid my car loan down to roughly $10,000.  I just refinanced it and got the best possible interest rate at the time (2.64%) over 60 months.  My payments are $191/mo with $174 going to the principle.  This is an extremely affordable loan for me.  I have the money saved to pay off this loan if I wanted, but my question is this:  Do I just let it ride for a while, to build my credit and show history?  My score is in the 720-735 range right now.  Or do I pay it off as quickly as I can to get out of the loan and save a measly $1,100 in interest?  My only other debt besides my car is my house which I'll probably end up selling soon.  Thanks a lot guys.",finance,1444252049

personalfinance,[Insurance] Health insurance lapsed - in the hole for $1300?,"Hi PF. This is my first time posting here, so please go easy on me if I have neglected crucial information. 

In December of 2014, my parents dropped me from their taxes and insurance so I could get a subsidized plan. I did not know they didn't pay for January and February, so in early January of 2015, I went to my OB/GYN and got a [very expensive] birth control implant put in. I thought I had insurance so it wouldn't be an issue. Evidently my new plan started in February of 2015, so I have a month of insurance lapsing. The new plan is with the same company as my old one and is similar to my old one, only subsidized. 

Today, the hospital calls me and informs me I have an outstanding balance of  approximately $1300. That was a little unexpected, given that I had received an acknowledgement that my claim was received by the insurance company, saying I owed them a few cents. Conveniently, I have misplaced this letter. The hospital says that my claim was denied by my insurance company because of a lapse in coverage. This charge is combined with another visit that was covered, but I owe money because of a high-ish deductible. 

The woman I spoke with offered me a payment plan of $100 per month; this would have no interest unless I miss a payment, allegedly. I have not received an itemized copy of these bills. Here is a little financial background:


-I am a full-time student.

-I work part time making 19/hr and will be doing so until December. After that, I will have no income other than food money from mom and pops. I work 20 hours per week and am subject to PA state taxes with few exemptions.

-My parents pay my rent as well as my tuition. I do not have student loans to worry about.

-Given that my parents are extremely generous, I would **strongly prefer** not to reach out for help on this, since they are supporting me a lot. I also would like to avoid having the birth control discussion with them. 

-My credit is meh, but I have a credit card with an extremely high limit and roughly 5% interest rate. It was opened in my name, but my father uses it for business purchases. It has a manageable balance that isn't really my problem at the moment. 

-I have a total of $2000 saved, as I was told I need to start saving for a house (at 21, this seems silly, but I do it anyway since my parents have asked me to do so.) I regard this account as untouchable.

-I have another account which fluctuates between $800-$1400 where my ""spending money"" is.


My perception of money may be a little skewed, but to me this seems like a manageable debt. While I can afford to pay it off all at once out of pocket, my question is as such: Is that the best course of action? 

If not, what is the most efficient way to do this? In addition, when I receive the itemized bill I'm definitely requesting, should I try to negotiate with Student Health on charges? If that is a yes, what is the best way to go about doing that? Is it likely that insurance will buckle and pay part of it if I call them to appeal the decision? My insurance company is BCBS of TN.

personalfinance,(US) I'm moving out of my parents house in the next 3 weeks.,"I was offered a job as a registered nurse in Baltimore and I don't actually know what I'm doing. 

**Background:** I'm 22, male, single, no debt/loans, and my credit score is in the 700s. I have 10k in savings, which is my emergency fund/""move out of my parents house"" fund. 

**Income:** After 10% going to my 403(b), and 30% tax, I'm left with $2760 dollars take home. I understand that there's deductibles and stuff, but any surplus will probably just get stuffed into a savings account or something. 

Here's the problem that I'm having. Rent. It's gonna be more than 30% of my income each month. It's going to be $1275. This doesn't include utilities, and parking is $70 a month. However, the location is convenient and is within walking distance from my workplace and basically everything else, which is why this is very appealing. If I walk to work, I'd cut down on my gasoline bill down to $30 a month. I wouldn't have to worry about car maintenance and stuff. I'd only be using my car to buy groceries. 

Food/gasoline/internet/tv/other household supplies (toilet paper, hygiene stuff) would come out to a max of $600.00.

I'd still have a few hundred dollars left over which would go into savings/retirement. 

I know I'm probably making a mistake here by paying this much in rent, but the convenience and the ""relative"" safety of the area makes it appealing for me.

I'm currently a senior at my state university majoring in Biology with a focus in neurobiology, physiology, and behavior.  I'm set to graduate in May 2016. I plan on taking a year off to pay off some of my federal student loans and some of my personal debt as well as to preparing for the MCAT and medical school. 

Due to some unwillingness on my parents part, I was unable to qualify for FAFSA for my senior year and was left with a couple of thousand in tuition that I would have to pay out of pocket, money that I don't have. My sister was kind enough to offer to cosign a loan to cover my final year so that I could focus on my schooling without having to get a second job. 

We are trying to decide whether a fixed rate interest loan or a variable rate loan would work best. Here are some things you might need to know.

- I am going to pay the loan back all by myself, my sister simply cosigned. 
- I'm currently working part time at a clinic for $10 but will most likely be working full time at this clinic upon graduation (possibly with a raise, I was offered a full time position before)
-I'm looking into getting a job in a lab as a second job upon graduation.

personalfinance,Looking for advice - Completely new to used car buying,"Sorry for the throwaway, I wanted to keep this private from my main account.

Anyways, so for some background I am a 22 year old college student who is thinking about buying a used car and has been saving for about 5 months. Right now I have graduated with a 4 year degree (with state/federal loan debt) and am working about 25 hours a week and going to a teaching credential school. I have a credit score of 715 with my oldest credit card being 4 years old. 

Every morning I go to an elementary school for 1 hour -&gt; work for 5 hours -&gt; school for an additional 3 hours. I drive my parents' car to the elementary school and work with my dad in the car so that he can drive the car back home when I start work. I then take the bus from work to school, and my dad picks me up after classes in the evening. So i'm using a combination of getting dropped off/driving my parents' car and using the bus to get between my 3 destinations everyday. I cant take the bus between the elementary school and work because I wont get to work in time, but I can take the bus between work and classes later in the evening. I cant take the car the whole time either because my parents use it as well, I cant hog it while i'm gone all day from 7:30AM to 8:00PM. 

Needless to say I really want to get my own transportation. Work and school are increasingly demanding, and I literally have to have my parents drive me anywhere I need to go with only one car for the family. I'm looking for a used car that I want to last quite a few years until I establish myself in my teaching career and can maybe finance a new car down the line. Also, my parents car has 220k+ miles on it and is just barely making it along. It could seriously die at any moment and my parents dont have the financial means to fix it.

Now for my finances, like I said earlier I have a 715 credit score with a small amount of credit history (but its there). My payment history has been excellent, making 100% of my payments on time so far. I make about ~$1200 a month with bi-weekly checks. I have student loan debt of $25k that is going to be deferred until I finish my credential program in 2 years in 2017. By the end of October 2015 i'll have ~$5400 in savings. My bills for a month include: $43 internet, $64 cell phone, $80 gas, $20 bus fare, ~$100 in groceries, and the rest goes towards irregular expenses and saving for a car. I live with my parents and manage to save about $800 a month toward a car.

I originally was going to save $8000 and pay for a used car flat out and open up my monthly savings, but my schedule is getting increasingly hectic with school and work so I think I will need a car sooner rather than later. My idea now is to use $4000 as a downpayment, keep $1400 in the bank for emergency, and finance the remaining car price amount for two years. That way I have money in the bank now in case of emergency (im not totally cleaned out with the purchase). I'm also keeping in mind that with a car i'm going to be adding ~$200/mo in insurance expenses. I'm completely new to car buying, but also to financing. What would be my best and wisest financing option? Is financing $2000-$3000 over 2 years plausible with my budget? Should I just hold out and pay for a car in full and avoid long-term financial commitment? I can see financing with my $1200/mo income with ~$300/mo in bills, ~$200/mo in insurance leaving me with $700 for random expenses and a car loan payment. 

Thanks in advance for any and all advice! Sorry for the long wall of text, just wanted to put all my ideas out there and relevant context to my financial situation.",finance,1444270972
personalfinance,"About to pay off student loan, about to take out car loan, scared, very scared","tldr: car wrecked. Have enough $ to still pay off student loan and pay down payment on new car, will still have savings, but scared to drain my account so fast, opinions?

So a big unexpected expense came up last week when I got in a bad car accident that totaled my car. I'm fine, the other driver is probably fine, I'm 99.9% positive they will put the fault on the other driver.

I randomly got a really good job shortly after finishing grad school (2012) and started working on my student loans right away. Since I became permanent at this job, my #1 financial goal was to pay off my student loans. I've been overpaying every month and after each tax season, I throw another large chunk at it. After last tax season I figured I should have enough to pay off my student loan and have a very healthy savings in early 2016.

Then this accident happened. I guess this is why we have savings. I was not planning on getting a new car any time soon, was hoping this one would last another 10+ years (bought it new in 2008). I'm still waiting on hearing what my settlement will be, should be any day now and I'm on edge. My car's bluebook value will not get me the same car in my area, that year and model sells for a few thousand more. After much mental debate, I decided to purchase a new car since it is a very long term necessity for me and I don't really care about always having a newish car. The car I want is also pretty scarce, there is one locally and two within 3 hour drive, and they sell fast so I'm also worried they'll sell before my settlement. So I jumped the gun (I now know, bad choice) and started talking to a dealer who pulled my credit and got approved through my bank for a loan. So far that's twice in a few days my credit got pulled. When the dealer first pulled it he said it was really good. The bank's car loan interest rate is lower than my student loan. Student loan 6.55%, car loan 4.99% fixed, 5.423% APR. I had them do worst case scenario, so big loan. Hopefully I can wheel and deal with another dealer tomorrow (will likely be a third time my credit gets pulled, hopefully last) and get a car reserved until I find out what my settlement will be. I have a credit card but I pay it off once or twice a month, I never let it accrue interest.

I really hate these big loans and I know that the more loans in my name the worse it looks. So, here's my plan, your opinions are greatly appreciated. If I do this plan, this will be the lowest my account has been in years, I was about to hit the submit button a few minutes ago to pay off the student loan but couldn't get myself to do it. I do have a stable, well paying job with lots of overtime opportunities, good health benefits (I'm so freakin lucky)

*student loan currently just over $15k. Pay within a few days to get rid of the loan before the car loan

*approx $5k out of pocket + whatever the settlement is for car down payment. I had the bank do a worst case scenario loan $15k, so even $0 settlement will get me a car (that would totally suck if that happens)

*Should still have just over $6k in the bank, $3500 in savings to meet the bank's minimum requirement

Keeps me at one loan, the car monthly payment would be a little lower than the autopay I set for my student loan, so it's an amount I'm used to seeing go every month.

She had two CCs, Discover Card which had a credit line of $1000. She went over the credit line and never paid it so it went to collection agency about a year go.

2nd credit card she had was a Old Navy store credit card. I think she says it had a credit line of like $500 but only charged about $100 to it but never paid it off, so the interest kept building off of that and now its over the credit limit so I think it went to collections too. 

About this card, is there something she can do? maybe dispute the collection, because about 80% of the charge on the card was just fees which caused it to go over the limit.

Also another question, when her CC debt is in collections agency, does it continue to collect interest? would it be at the same interest rate as what the cards APR was?

That's the current state of my finances, currently I was taking a semester off from post-secondary, however I'm going back soon and will be looking at ~$7,000-$8,000 per year in tuition. I also currently do not have a vehicle but will need to purchase one in the next several months, but have not yet made any decision pertaining to that.



So my current living situation, I live with my mother in a house we are renting ($1200/mo.), and we've been renting the same house for 17 years now. She raised my me and my sister as a single mother, and unfortunately hasn't been very financially stable. She recently got a better job (~$38,000/yr.) and she dislikes our current home, and wants to move somewhere else.

personalfinance,Another data breach - scottstrade,"Dear Client:

We are writing to share with you important information about a security compromise involving a database containing some of your personal information, as well as steps we are taking in response, and the resources we are making available to you. 

What Happened 

Federal law enforcement officials recently informed us that they’ve been investigating cybersecurity crimes involving the theft of information from Scottrade and other financial services companies. We immediately initiated a comprehensive response. 

Based upon our subsequent internal investigation coupled with information provided by the authorities, we believe a list of client names and street addresses was taken from our system. Importantly, we have no reason to believe that Scottrade’s trading platforms or any client funds were compromised. All client passwords remained encrypted at all times and we have not seen any indication of fraudulent activity as a result of this incident. 

Although Social Security numbers, email addresses and other sensitive data were contained in the system accessed, it appears that contact information was the focus of the incident. 

The unauthorized access appears to have occurred over a period of several months between late 2013 and early 2014. We have secured the known intrusion point and conducted an internal data forensics investigation on this incident with assistance from a leading computer security firm. We have taken appropriate steps to further strengthen our network defenses. 

What Happens Now 

Federal authorities had requested that they be allowed to complete much of their investigation before we notified clients. In coordination with them, we are now able to alert you of this incident. We are fully cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation and prosecution of the criminals involved. 

Notices like this one are being sent to all individuals and entities whose information was contained in the affected database, and we have included here information about steps you can take to protect yourself. 

Information about this incident is available online at https://About.Scottrade.com/CyberSecurityUpdate, and we will update that web page if new data becomes available. 

What You Can Do 

As always, we encourage you to regularly review your Scottrade and other financial accounts and report any suspicious or unrecognized activity immediately. As recommended by federal regulatory agencies, you should remember to be vigilant for the next 12 to 24 months and report any suspected incidents of fraud to us or the relevant financial institution. Please also read the important information included on ways to protect yourself from identity theft. 

We encourage clients to be particularly vigilant against email or direct mail schemes seeking to trick you into revealing personal information. Never confirm or provide personal information such as passwords or account information to anyone contacting you. Please know that Scottrade will never send you any unsolicited correspondence asking you for your account number, password or other private information. If you receive any letter or email requesting this information, it is fraudulent and we ask that you report it to us at phishing@scottrade.com. Be cautious about opening attachments or links from emails, regardless of who appears to have sent them. 

Identity Theft Protection 

As a precaution, Scottrade has arranged with AllClear ID to help you protect your identity at no cost to you for a period of one year. You are pre-qualified for identity repair and protection services and have additional credit monitoring options available, also at no cost to you. 

You can call AllClear ID with any concerns about your identity at 855.229.0083. This hotline is available from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm (central) Monday through Saturday. 

We have also included additional steps you could consider at any time if you ever suspect you’ve been the victim of identity theft. We offer this out of an abundance of caution so that you have the information you need to protect yourself. 

We are very sorry that this happened and for any uncertainty or inconvenience this has caused you. We know that incidents like these are frustrating. We take the security of your information very seriously and are committed to continually strengthening and evolving our defenses based on new and emerging threats.

My logic behind paying off my private debt and transferring it to my federal debt is that the interest will be lower and I am interested in working in the public sector which would wipe the debt in 10 yrs.
EDIT: I guess I was wrong in my assumption but my logic was that with law school you can take out the full cost of attendance for the year. I am currently taking out way below that level.

personalfinance,[PLANNING] Saving aggressively for home ownership.,"Hello! 


I recently moved back to my hometown in rural Alaska to secure gainful employment and replenish my savings account. Over the course of four and a half months I have worked four different jobs and continue to work three of those jobs ( hospitality, lifeguarding, and clerical ) simultaneously clocking in about 70 hours a week with a general pay range of $17 - $22 an hour. I'm also in the process of either transferring departments at my full-time job or receiving a promotion in my current department which will bring me to $27 an hour with any luck. Before taxes, I make about a 5k a month. After taxes it averages at around 4 - 4.5k. 



My girlfriend, who just made the move to Alaska, has started working as an on-call substitute teacher but her work is inconsistent ( usually 2-3 days a week at $27 / HR with 7 HR days ) so it's a little tricky to accurately project her income. She is about to start a guaranteed month and a half of subbing, however, which will be amazing but obviously won't last forever. 



We're both committed to saving jointly and aggressively to purchase a house here in the next couple of years but are currently being eaten alive by the micro-expenses that come with relocating and moving into a new apartment. We're also looking to obtain our degrees via online courses while we're up here ( she's working towards becoming a nutritionist and I'm working on a business administration / rural development double major ) and will have the majority of our educational expenses paid by scholarships.


My main concerns / questions when it comes to saving for a house: 



1 ) What is a reasonable target amount to save up to before we make the plunge? The houses we have in mind are around 250 - 350k. 


2 ) As an Alaskan Native that belongs to a Federally recognized tribe, is it worth pursuing a Federal I-80 HUD loan ( might be called something else ) instead of traditionally financing one? The 5% down payment and upwards of a 500k limit sounds nice on paper but it feels a little too good to be true.



3 ) While our relationship is rock solid, my girlfriend doesn't exactly have a lot of experience with saving and managing her own finances. I also have had nothing but bad experiences with joint accounts and am wary of melding our finances. The plan would be to maintain completely separate accounts and just have her withdraw / transfer money as the need arises. Is that the most effective course of action or would creating a joint expense-only account be more advisable? 


4 ) The end-game for us is to mirror what my parents are currently doing which is buying one property and rent it out / pump as much money into it as possible until it is mostly paid off and then purchase another property and then rinse and repeat until the rentals can pay themselves off. The ideal would be to own ( not pay off, mind ) a house in at least four years -- based on my current income ( ~60 - 65k) alone, is that feasible?



In general any tips when it comes to saving / budgeting / financing for home ownership would be amazing. I want to make sure that I'm making the most of my time and establishing clear and realistic goals and or adjust my expectations accordingly. 


EDIT: Oops, thought I could add a flair by just bracketing planning. Sorry for the ridiculous title, guys.",finance,1444326003
worldpolitics,This Time is Different: Exponential Growth,"[See post with pictures](http://www.legendary-peace.com/2015/10/why-this-time-is-different-exponential.html)

The definition of exponential growth is growth which has a rate that becomes ever more rapid in proportion to the growing total number or size. Put simply, 2*2=4 4*4=16 16*16 =256… Over time, these numbers become staggeringly large. For instance just following the sequence above for two more repetitions will lead you to 4,294,967,296. And then that multiplied together is out of range for a standard calculator. As Dr. Albert Butler put it, “the greatest shortcoming of the human race is the inability to understand the exponential function.”

As it is clearly laid out in the charts above, we could coin the industrial growth paradigm as the exponential growth paradigm and still be telling the truth. However you want to lay it out, humanity seems programmed to grow according to the exponential function. My theory is that due to our primitive roots, we evolved to survive based on exponential growth. If you were bigger, wealthier, and stronger, you would live. In earlier times we couldn’t be worried about global issues because everything was much more centralized. It was us verses them and that meant survival. Growth was the golden standard.

When we hit the agricultural revolution, we become more stationary thus allowing for experimentation with technology and science. At this juncture in human evolution, we never changed our growth mentality. It didn't cross our minds to think of potential limits to growth because growing exponentially was still in the best interest of private parties. What shifted at this juncture was the element at stake. No longer was physical survival the driver of growth but now it was economic survival that led the paridigm. The agricultural revolution led to the industrial revolution which led to where we are now. It could be said that today’s society is the offspring of the agricultural revolution. Because of this, we are still following growth paradigm that is in the interest of private parties.

The obvious downside to this is that there is likely a limit to growth. At a certain point, the host (earth) can no longer provide an exponential growth environment; resources become exhausted. To put this in perspective I want to point towards the best example of exponential growth I’ve ever come across. Chris Martenson at http://www.peakprosperity.com has a thought experiment which shows the gravity of the situation when an exponential growth paradigm reaches its limits.

The experiment pretends that at 12:00pm a drop of water is placed on the pitchers mound of a baseball stadium. The “catch” is that the drop of water will double every minute, the baseball stadium is watertight sealed, and you are handcuffed to the very top balcony seat. By the end of two minutes there will be two drops of water. By the end of six minutes there will be a blob of water on the pitchers mound about the size of your hand. The question posed is how long do you have to escape from the handcuffs? In other words when is the baseball stadium going flood with water and kill you? Martenson calculates that you have until 12:49pm that day to get out of the stadium. In other words, in just 49 minutes the baseball stadium will flood entirely.


Here’s the amazing part. At what time of the day would the baseball stadium be 93% air? At this point, there may be some water on the infield but it would appear like there is plenty of time to escape before water reaches the upper bleachers. Wrong. The stadium would be 93% air at 12:45pm. This means in just 5 minutes, the stadium that had a bit of water on the infield would flood entirely and drown the person handcuffed to the bleachers. Do you think the person in the bleachers realized how close they were to death when the water filled only 7% of the stadium?

When you run the exponential growth paradigm in a limited environment, you will quickly go past the carrying capacity without even blinking. In fact, it won’t even seem like there is danger until it is very late in the game. The obvious connection I am drawing is that humanity’s growth paradigm is carrying out this example on a longer time scale. The beginning of the industrial revolution was likely the point when the stadium was 93% air and the time was 12:45. Today we are somewhere in the awkward range between12:47-12:48pm. What the hell is going on? The water seems to be rising very very quickly.

The common counter to this example is that humanity will simply do what it always has done. We will technologically evolve through our crises. While this has been true in the past, I think today we should be more mature and ask a more rational question. Are we addicted to growth? The exponential charts above in combination with the stadium example paint a grave picture. Any logical person would look at this and would agree that it’s a probably the most serious situation humanity has ever faced. We are like blind men driving through a crash course, hoping not to have a head on collision. And as we’ve recently learned, hope is not effective policy. A much wiser solution would be to curb our growth to a stable output and then weigh the best approach moving forward. If we did this, and then decided exponential growth suits humanatiy best, I’d be all for it. But the fact of the matter is that we can’t do this. We do not have enough control over our growth paradigm to slow it down. It is in control of us. This is at the crux of the intensifying global situation and it needs to be beaten in our heads. We are not programmed to think this way and it’s about time we start to.

investing,BRKNG: Increase of downside risks led Fed to hold off rate hike in September,"Fed officials held off of a rate hike in September as many thought downside risks had increased, according to minutes of the meeting released Thursday. 

Officials decided it would be ""prudent"" to wait, even though many thought that the weaker growth outlook for China that emerged in August and the subsequent drop in stock prices around the world would ""likely"" have a small effect on the economy. Some voting members of the Fed policy committee said that these global developments did not increase their confidence that inflation would return to the central bank's 2% target. 

Fed officials were split, with some worried that hiking rates too soon would push inflation lower and others saying that delaying a hike for much longer would risk an undesirable buildup of inflation. In the end, the Fed voted 9 to 1 to hold rates steady.

Also, once she got approval to open the card, she was told that she had to close one of her other accounts which are with different banks.

Are balance transfers normally a % of the balance, and can they mandate that you have to close an account with a competing bank to qualify for approval?

personalfinance,Should I pay off Mortgage or work on retirement accounts,"Just to give some background, I'm 41 and wife is 40. We got married a year ago. I have no 401k or retirement accounts. My wife has 50k in her 401k and no other retirement accounts. Total household income is around $175k a year.

I had a lot of debt growing up and family was quite poor. Parents each had filed bankruptcy in the past. I racked up 100k of debt by age 30 (almost all was spent on health bills and rent/food for the family), but I worked the past 10 years to clear it up. I'm debt free except for the mortgage and we finally put $110k in the savings account (100k was mine, 10k was the wifes). I also cleared up my credit (avg 845 fico score out of 850 ; high 847, low 843)

We now have $500k owed on our mortgage. Monthly is about $4650 on the mortgage (this includes tax, FHA fee, and insurance as well ; it's bundled by the bank). It's a 30 year mortgage at 5.375% with 5 years paid off already. It's a multi-family but the other residence has 5 of our relatives and we don't get rent or help from them (they're old, sick, and disabled, they can barely afford their medical bills).

Expenses are around $2500 a month but this is variable due to health issues (I'm a cancer survivor and wife has PCOS, so lots of doc visits [we do have health insurance from work so that helps]). We're putting about $2.5 in savings a month at the moment. We're not putting anything in the wife's 401k. We stopped 3-4 years ago to save up for the house and never started it up again.

I can't seem to lower the interest rate on the house as I'm told I don't have enough equity in the house (just 50k). Only bank that offered to lower it wanted to reset my term to 30 years so when I recalculated everything, I'd lose money refinancing because it would cost less to make the 25*12*4650 then the 30*12*new monthly fee.

Wife was asking me my we don't put some of that savings into the mortgage, but I'm really afraid of touching the savings. We have steady jobs, but non the less, I've been there in the past where everything that could go wrong was going wrong and each day I used to wonder if I'm going to live in the streets homeless the next day. So no matter what, I need to keep an emergency fund just in case.

I'm really not sure what to do at the moment. Should I just work on an IRA or 401k? Or work to payoff the mortgage? I just hate how much the mortgage is but I know I need to save up for retirement in the future.",finance,1444335951

Here's part of my problem: I'm a bartender, and make most of my money in tips.  The income I submit is about $25,000/yr.  In reality, I make more like $38-40k.  This isn't r/legal and I want to adhere to the rules - I'm not here for legal advice, nor am I here to seek counsel on illegal activities; the tips/tax situation is pretty fucked and totally confusing so I go to a tax professional and let him handle it, he's been filing for me for the past 2 years.

personalfinance,Sister-in-law way underwater - need some suggestions to help get her finances in order,"My sister-in-law is in a bit of bind financially, and I'm at a loss for how to help her.  She graduated from college a couple of years ago with a bachelors degree in psychology and with approximately 50K in federal education loans (~2.5% interest).  She has paid this down to about 40K.  She also currently has about 6K in credit card debt, which she is having trouble getting paid down.

She makes about $14 an hour.  She lives with her parents, rent free, but is called upon to pay for utilities and other household expenses.  At the end of the day, she has nothing in savings and makes the minimum payment on all of her loans.  I have my suspicions that her parents are asking her to take on a lot of the house expenses (food and so on), further draining her account.  She is in her mid 20's, and basically sees no hope for her financial future.

My thoughts in regards to this were that she should try to find a cheap apartment in the area, which would allow her to have better control of her money (parents not guilting her to kick in for things).  I am willing to front the 3 month deposit for her to get this rolling, but I'm unsure how sustainable paying for an apartment (approx. $850 / month) in this area is for her.  

She's had a very difficult time finding a job that would utilize her degree.  I'm not even sure what type of field / position would be appropriate to try to enter with a BS in Psych.

Any suggestions?",finance,1444347986

personalfinance,Is Student Loan income-based repayment a huge scam?,"So, I'll preface this by saying I have never been the most financially responsible individual. 

I took out about $30k in federal unsubsidized loans, had another $25k in private loans from Wells-Fargo, and somehow managed to rack up $28k in credit card debt over the 8 years I was working on my 4-year degree.

**I know, I know. I was (maybe still sometimes am) an idiot**

I've luckily been working on turning my situation around. Most of the credit card debt was from a business I started, called Dear Drunk Me (look it up, we got pretty big.. problem is I just had no concrete plans of how to monetize it) and I also opened a head shop called Divided by Zero.  I funded both these projects on credit cards (ugh. I know)

It got really bad, and I ended up declaring Ch 7 bankruptcy protection in 2012. I got a good corporate sales job shortly after, and just ignored my student loans for the past few years.

I recently started dating the love of my life. She is German-born and a great, responsible, frugal person.  She found out about my tumultuous financial history and has been super supportive (if not sometimes a bit stressed out) about helping me get it completely turned around.

I stick to a budget, I applied for a secured credit card a year ago that just got upgraded to unsecured. I use it only for gas and pay it off each month in full.

I also was able to negotiate a huge settlement with the private student loan, paying only $3200 of the $25k.  This was a huge boost in my financial confidence. 

Now all I have left of my debt is my federal student loans.  That's not to say it is not daunting.  I just applied for an income-based repayment plan and was shocked to find out that my payments are going to be $200.00 per month, of which roughly $170 is interest.

**I just received an $8000 inheritance and $1000 deposit return from my secured credit card.  Would I be better off to pay all $9000 towards the $30k federal student loans?** 

It makes me cringe, but I feel it may be the best thing to do given the huge interest charges I'm looking at.",finance,1444350399

personalfinance,Question about whether to do a home refi and what type?,"Hi PF! I could really use some advice on a possible mortgage refi. Sorry in advance for what may be a wordy question!

Wife and I have a 30 yr fixed mortgage at 5.25%. Been in the house for six years and plan on being in it for about 7 more.

Would like to put new windows in the house but they are not a necessity.

Have two outstanding debts we would also like to pay off. One is a Home Equity loan on previous home at 5.99% and the other is an unsecured personal loan at 4.75%.
Each is around $4k and will otherwise be paid off in the next 3-4 yrs. 

No other debt. We both drive older cars that may need to be replaced in the next year or two but no other large financial expenses that are looming that I can think of.

Home values in our area have risen based off of nearby sales. 

Zillow estimates our homes current value at about $30k more than we paid for it. No idea how accurate Zillow's estimate might be but it seems possible. 

While this isn't a  huge amount it seems like it would be enough that with the equity we already have in the home we could probably pay off the debt and get us some windows. 

The question is whether we should?

A local credit union has offered us a 20 yr fixed cashout refi at 4.25% that we could afford although the payments would be higher due to the shortened term. Or we could instead do a straight up refi at 3.75% over the same term with no cash out and even more affordable payments.

They are also running a promotion off closing costs if we do it before year end.


So is it worth doing either in our position, especially if we only plan on staying in the house for 7 years? Is there another type of refi we should consider instead to take advantage of the lower interest rates and higher value of the home? Would we be better off with a home equity loan? Any pros or cons I am not considering or aware of?

Thanks for any guidance you can give us!",finance,1444354651
personalfinance,"29, sold my first home, have $43,000, looking for advice","My wife and I just sold our first home 4 weeks ago, we came away with $43,000.  We probably didn't make any money in the long run, we only owned the house for 5 years, rented it to my sister for 2 years at a discount.

When we purchased we put down a down payment of $30,000.  So we are coming out $13,000 ""ahead"" (minus all the headache, time, and fix-it projects).  

We are both 29, we live in a large city now, and we already own a second home (now our only home, yay! -- townhome with no yard this time, yay!).  We make a combined income pre-tax of around $150,000.  

She contributes 6% to her 401k, and I contribute 4% to mine, but we don't have any other investment/retirement funds in place.  We'd like to open traditional IRAs.  I have plans to increase my contribution.  Perhaps someone can tell us if we should do even more than that (I'm only contributing what gets matched).

We do ""budget"" -- but we're pretty bad about following it.  That's probably not really budgeting... We have all of our recurring expenses written down in a spreadsheet, along with allotments for various categories such as eating out, home care, car maintenance, gasoline, groceries, luxury (entertainment, shopping, etc), gifts, and so on.  I track everything we spend, inputting all of our receipts and truing up with our joint credit card several times a month via the spreadsheet.  So at the very least we know where the money is going.

We put everything on a Delta Amex for the SkyMiles (we like to travel).  Generally unless we have a very large trip or it is around the holidays we pay the credit card off in full at the end of every month.  We generally spend everything we make.  I know, really stupid, its a struggle.  Hopefully with the second mortgage and associated costs gone it'll be a little easier and we'll try to do better.

We have a very small emergency fund, equivalent to about 1 months pay.  I know we need to increase that to at least ~3 months pay.

We have no credit card debt (other than the aforementioned frivolous spending every month that is generally paid in full).  My wife has about ~3,000 in student loan debt left at a fairly low interest rate (4% I think?), I'm not sure if we should pay it off or not.  

We have two car payments.  We have one with roughly $6,000 left and another with $18,000 left.  We're looking to trade/sell both and get new cars.  Her's is older and out of warranty, and while I am very automotive capable, I've gotten to the point that time is money and spending time fixing cars for myself isn't profitable.  Mine has extended powertrain warranty until 100,000/mi or 2018, but I'd like something more practical (2 door sports car, 6sp, ~17mpg) in my life. 

I'm wondering since we plan to trade/sell these cars and get news ones, if it is worth paying them off?  I think that if I am looking to sell private party and maximize our payout then it is better to have the title in hand?  I'm unsure about the dealer trade-in situation (I hate dealers, I am a horrible negotiator).

Alternatively we could stand, and even may end up, holding onto both cars another 6 to 12 months.  So in that situation would it be better to pay them off?

Finally, we do have the second home.  I don't know if it would be worth it or not to dump some large some into the mortgage or not?  On the surface it sounds like a good idea to me.  We don't have plans to leave or sell our current home anytime soon.

In closing, my current plan is:

- Set 2 months pay aside to add to the current 1 month emergency fund.
- Set up two traditional IRAs.

Options I'm not certain about:

- Pay off 3,000 of student loan debt
- Pay off 24,000 worth of car loans
- Put lump sum into current mortgage

Additionally, maybe someone can help with this, but I don't think we'll be taxed on the sale of our home?  Everything I've read seems to tell me we won't be hit with capital gains tax.

If any one has other advice out there for our situation, we'd love to hear it.",finance,1444354731
personalfinance,Series ee savings bonds in graduate school,"I am a 28 year old married graduate student. Before starting graduate school my husband and I had about $5000 in cc debt left over from wedding/ honeymoon that we planned on paying off over the summer but then were hit with a $19,000 medical bill (currently on a payment plan of $800 per month no interest) and I found about some unpaid collection debts that my husband had forgotten about totaling about $1700. 

We are now about $3000 in CC debt with $28,000 (so far…. Oh god grad school is expensive) in student loans, and $16,500 in medical debt and still $1700 in collection debt.

I have about 100 series ee savings bonds totaling about $8,300 in currently redeemable value. My currently plan is to: cash out the ones from 05/1995- 03/1997 earning a fixed rate of  1.27% interest and 05/1997-04/2005 earning a variable rate of 1.35% interest. (All these bonds together total about $4600 which is about enough to squash the CC and collections debt). And to cash the newer ones (post 05/2005) earning fixed rates between 3.2 and 3.7% and the really old ones from 11/1991 -03/1995 earning 4% interest, next year so I can take out less student loans since their interest rate is higher. 

My question is, is this a sound plan? 

I know that as a student the interest doesn’t count against my income taxes but mine and my husband’s total earned income for 2015-2017 will likely be only $40,000-$45,000 per year. So would it be better to cash them all out during the years I am a student before our income bracket goes way up (hopefully 2018 I will get a job paying ~$70,000 /year plus my husband’s income). Or should I be saving the newer ones as an emergency fund at least until they reach face value payout. From what I have read on PF people tend to encourage holding the savings bonds as an emergency fund until they are fully mature but no one that I could find mentioned the graduate school aspect.

personalfinance,"Close old card now, or wait?","Looking for some advice while I do more investigating into the topic. Here is my issue: I have my first credit card ever, issued by ""1st Financial Bank USA"". It was a basic starter card, $400 limit etc. I want to close it, because I have not used it in 5+ years and my personality is the type that hates having it open, unused and waiting to be breached (I work for the government and was recently part of the OPM data break, already had one fraudulent charge on my debit card i had to clear up).

A bit of backstory on myself first. I have two other cards, a Bank of America Signature and American Express Blue, both of which I racked up huge debt on during college because of unusually high credit limits and terrible ""young life"" choices. I currently make $50k a year (medical residency) and by this time next year will make $80k-100k depending on where I land a job. Thankfully, I have not been using any credit card for almost a full year now (except an occasional tank of gas that's paid in full etc.) and with the help of YNAB I am finally getting my budget under control, meaning I will be able to more seriously pay down some cards vs. continued minimum payments. The card information is as follows:

    1st Financial bank
    Date opened:    6/2006
    Current balance: $0
    Current Limit: $1,800
    
    BoA
     Date opened:    7/2006
    Current balance: $12,388
    Current Limit: $14,000
    
    Amex
    Date opened:    11/2007
    Current balance: $8,346
    Current Limit: $9,300 

Both BoA/AMex are actively going to be paid off, Amex more agressively (higher interest rate). All cards have been in good standing for &gt;24 months. 

Now, knowing that the 1st FB card is my ""oldest"" by a month, and that it may negatively impact my history (although it will still remain on there, but I would ""lose"" $1,800 from an already tight debt/credit ratio, right?), I am wondering if I should take the plunge and cancel now, or wait until the Amex card is paid off/mostly paid off until closing. Either way I wish to close it, I just do not know when. Currently I am thinking it would be better to cut the card up and wait.",finance,1444358270

So my wife and I are about to buy our first cars. We both have cars already. Her parents bought her her's. Mine was purchased with cash off craigslist. We have no experience with dealers or car loans. We have her car, which is a 2003 Altima with a peeling clear coat and an engine that sounds a little rough (Not a mechanic, but apparently its fine. The check engine light comes on for a day or two once every few months, we get it checked, they tell us not to worry. Maybe we need a new car guy). With 160k miles we figure we can get 1-2k for trade in. We are able to put another $500-1250 as down payment. Our credit is decent. Her's is probaby between 700 and 725 and I just got a credit card with her to begin building mine, paying it off completely each month. I work making about 1500 a month and she is in school, works as a GA and has some loans to help support us. Here is what I was hoping to learn from you gents and ladies:

* What should we expect as far as loan maximum amounts and interest rates? I was thinking around 6%, but I am not confident in that and want to know before negotiating.

* How much can we expect to be able to negotiate the price of a typical used car? I have no idea if I can expect to get them down $250 or $2500.

* How expensive are the ""fees"" I hear about with dealers? will they roll into the loan?

* If you know about cars, do the amounts I have listed seem reasonable?

* Our credit history is positive but short, only about 18 months. Is this likely to affect our ability to be approved?

I wont go into a long speech about what exactly my college experience was like but I will say that some bad advice, poor decisions and a lack of direction led me to the point where I am now a graduate with a B.A. in History - Japan Studies and around $100,000 in debt.

I'm sure it's not too difficult to guess that this particular degree is not a great degree for finding work and although I have applied to many hundreds of jobs across several states I have yet to find work nearly half a year after graduating. I have less then a couple hundred bucks to my name and am surviving off the good graces of other people.

My question is, and yes I know it took a while to get here, I am now faced with not being able to pay my loans or even to pay the $150 three month forbearance option that Navient keeps telling me is my only option. My Fiance looked around the internet and has told me to just let them do whatever they're going to do, be it getting debt collectors involved or attempting to sue me, but to stop trying to keep forbearing since I frankly can't anymore. I understand that doing this will destroy the credit I have but I don't know what options I have. I also have federal loans but I was able to do a economic hardship deferment so these have not been coming into play as of yet.

Again sorry for bringing up an issue I'm sure has been brought up before but they don't teach you any of this crap in school...unless of course you become a lawyer or something along those lines.

Hello Reddit Community of Personal Finance,

First, forgive me if this is the wrong subreddit or flair within the subreddit to use for this post. Please PM me the correct place to post this for help. Thanks.

Ok, let me first start by saying a few things that will sort of lay the groundwork for what responses I get and will help those taking time to help me, do it better. I am open to everything, from traditional advice to off-the-wall crazy things. The only exception is bankruptcy. I would really like that to be the ultimate last resort – very very last – like, that or homelessness, and I’ll go to court for bankruptcy. Otherwise, I really would like to come up with a plan that is both realistic and optimal for my financial situation. 

Ok, so a little about me – I am a white, female, age 68 years of age and retired from the medical industry. I live with my daughter, who cannot work due to disability – while awaiting her case to complete in court, she gets a small sum of money, (less than $400) that I do not ask her for because she is going to live with me until I die and will not put me in a nursing home. 

I also live with my grandson, who is an artist and his income is variable. Sometimes he has given me $7,000/month and other months it is nothing. It just depends. I don’t want to depend on his income either, though. I got myself in this and I want help getting out within my means and options. I am unable to go back to work – my body can barely handle getting from bedroom to kitchen, but I am far from death. My husband, for those who may ask, died in March. So, it’s just me, my daughter and grandson. We make a great team and no body freeloads, but we all feel crunched by my debt and financial woes. So, any advice and help is greatly appreciated. Below, you will find a detailed but non-personally identifiable description of our monthly finances. 

Lastly, we are currently looking at shaving the cable down to internet only, (I would have dropped that, but grandson sells his art online). We are also looking at selling the smaller older house that I don’t owe anything one. We could also sell my car back to dealership and get a good used one so we can get like 5-10k back from the car. We are also looking at refinancing my current home with a reverse mortgage since we have so much equity. 

How did I get so bad? I was fine until March. My husband died and I spent everything I could to have my daughter and grandson move in with me. My daughter has an adopted daughter and she needed a good school. Where I lived at the time wasn’t good, so we moved 10 miles to another city that has wonderful elementary schools. I also just haven’t been thoughtful in my depression. I am better now and ready to get my finances right so my family doesn’t suffer when I am gone. I just have no clue where to start. I was well-off before now. I had over $270,000 in the bank and multiple annuities and mutual funds. However, after my husband died – I lost it all and went bonanzas. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thank You Kindly.

investing,FED: rate hike could be appropriate in October,"A rate hike in October or December is still ""likely appropriate"" as the economy is on a satisfactory track, said Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Atlanta Fed, on Friday. In a speech in New York, Lockhart said there is ""a touch more downside risk"" in the current environment than a few weeks ago. 

But he said he was not going to let one piece of data overly influence his outlook. Many economists think the weak September job report rules out a Fed hike this year. Lockhart is a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year and is often a bellwether on the thinking of the moderate center at the U.S. central bank.

personalfinance,Should I move out now or wait? Does my budget look okay?,"Financial background:

I am 24 years old and have been working in a salaried position for a little over a year now since graduating college. During this time, I have been living with my family. I have no pressing issues that are forcing me to move out, and my family is very loving and supportive, but it is something that I want to do.

I started work with $34k student loan debt at ~7% interest. Through aggressive paydowns and refinanciing, I currently have $10k at 3.5%. I contribute 7% of my income to a 401k currently, which my employer matches (more would not be matched). I have $5k currently in savings.

Monthly take home income:  $3700

Tentative Budget:

Car Payment.......$325 ($16k remaining at 0.9%)

Cell Phone..........$85

Loan Payment.....$200

Rent...................$1300

Utilities...............$200

Food, Misc.........$600

Car Insurance.....$100

Total..................$2810


This would leave me with a little under $900 a month for savings, unexpected expenses and additional loan payments. Does this look reasonable? $1300 is the high end of what I would expect to pay for a 1 BR in my area with $1000 being the low end of what I am looking for. I would also be able to cut my commute down from an hour to less than 10 minutes by moving.

The other option is to wait a while longer and finish paying off the student loan ASAP, but with a reasonable interest rate on my remaining debt, I don't feel compelled to do this.

personalfinance,I am an attorney earning 6-figures and just received and inheritance. I have absolutely no idea how to handle my money.,"Okay,  I admit it: I need help.  I have absolutely no idea how to handle my finances.  I do not know how to prioritize debt, I do not know how to balance paying debt and savings, I do not understand long-term savings options, and I do not know how to handle my inheritance.


For some reason, I have a serious block about this.  Every time I sit down to handle my long-term finances, I get very overwhelmed.  I handle my day-to-day finances just fine... but I have neglected to enroll in my company's 401K and I don't have substantial cash savings.  I have a pretty serious learning disability and anxiety triggers it... with finances, I find myself so overwhelmed that I am currently too anxious to seek out a financial adviser/planner (pathetic, I know).  Further, I grew up modest at best, poor at worst, and just don't know what to do with these sums of money.


Here is my situation:


Income: $160,000/year + bonus (approx $10-25,000).


* Monthly Income:  $9,500-$10,000 after taxes and insurances
* Rent:                  $2,500 (no bills as SO takes the rest of the rent and bills)
* Credit Cards:       $11,500 ($10,000 interest free for another few months, $1500 at SUPER low interest through a random bank program... interest rates locked until this time next year)
* Student Loans:   $197,000 (give or take), my current monthly payment is $2718.  Some of these are at as high as 7% interest.  I am eligible for graduate repayment, with payments dropping down to about $1200 now and maxing out around $3800.


Further, I have the paper work for about $40,000 in an inheritance from two IRAs.


I am 26, have no children, a very very stable career with a clear upward salary trajectory (lock-step compensation).  I would like to eventually purchase a home and kids are likely in 3-4 years.  I'd like to have a better grip on my finances before then.


Goals:
1. Pay of Credit Card Debt. I haunts me.  I feel very silly having as much income as I do and sitting on fairly high interest debt.  I have put my card away and stopped spending, but I want it gone.
2. Cash savings.  I currently have only $3000 in cash.  I would like to have more like $20,000 to cover our high living expenses for six months or so.  Is this sufficient or necessary?  If it makes a difference, I have access to probably somewhere between $60,000 and $100,000 in available credit.
3.  Retirement savings.  What should I be doing here?  I know I am young and need to start now... but how? 
4.  Student loans.  They are crippling.


Reddit, please help me.  I am so down on myself about this and just don't know where to do.  My family is no help and I am so nervous about asking for help.


Some questions:

1. With my $10,000/month, how should I be spending it?  About $3500 is locked with rent and living expenses (food, etc).  What portion should I pay to debt vs. save?
2.  How should I prioritize my debt?  Should I pay the CCs off first and make minimum student loan payments until then, then use the CC money to pay the student loans?
3. Should I roll the inherited money into an IRA? Or should I pay off debt?
4.  Similarly, my yearly bonus will come within the next few months and may be as high as $25,000.  What is the best way to handle this?
5.  What is a reasonable amount of cash savings with my stable income but high living expenses and good access to credit?  How should this be prioritized with paying off debt?
6. My employer does not match 401K contributions.  I know I need to enroll and max my contribution.  Aside from this, how should I balance long-term savings with debt management? 
7. Finally, should I hire a financial planner?  If so, any advice on how to do that?


Thank you all so much.

personalfinance,"Has anyone ever consolidated their ParentPlus loans (in their parent's names) over to themselves (the graduate)? Would love some guidance, if so!","Hey PF hivemind... very specific question, but was wondering if anyone had a good POV on this.

Here's the situation: 

I went to college and took out loans [I think I'm kind of unique ;) ]. While there I took out Stafford loans in my own name and my mother took out Parent+ loans to fund the other portion. 

Since graduating three years ago, I've been paying off both my personal student loans and the loans in my mom's name. I'm cool with the rates I'm getting on my personal loans, but the Parent+ ones kinda suck (~7.5% when blended).

In an ideal world, I'd take a loan out with a financial institution to pay off the loans in my mom's name that would then transfer to me. I'm hoping it would ""clean up"" my personal balance sheet, make tax filings easier, and hopefully secure me some better interest rates.

Has anyone else ever done this?

If so:

- What company/institution did you go through?
- How difficult was it?
- What do I need to prepare?
- Are you saving in the end?

Personal info if helpful: 
- High credit score (750+)
- Very stable career with enough monthly take home pay to be aggressive with paying down loans",finance,1444406559

personalfinance,Saving vs student loan not being billed (x-post from r/StudentLoans),"I currently do not have an emergency fund saved up--I'm working on it but only have ~$800 at the moment because of a recent move that wiped out a lot of it. I don't have much room in my budget to put away a lot of money every month (I automatically have $50 deducted every month from my paycheck and then put any extra money I have at the end of the month into savings) so building my emergency fund will take a *pretty* long time and I'd like to start putting any extra money I have to student loans ASAP. I currently am ~$71K in student debt (the only debt I have). I have 7 federal loans totaling ~$35.5K and one hefty private loan for ~$35.5K. My monthly payment for my federal loans is $220 and for my private loan it's $237. Here's where things get a little wonky.

In April, my private loan lender got wind that my co-signer (not a family member) was preparing to declare bankruptcy so they stopped billing me. Not knowing why my bill was $0/month, I continued to make payments thinking maybe it was just paid ahead and didn't look much into it. I was then billed in August for the normal $237 but not for September so I called and found out that my co-signer had officially declared bankruptcy. This means they won't be billing me for the duration of time he is in bankruptcy. No, I'm not at risk for default. No, I can't release the co-signer yet. Yes, interest is still accruing. My question is this: **Do I take advantage of this unknown period of time when I'm not being billed and pay less than the $237/month and put the extra in my emergency fund? Or do I continue to pay the monthly payment because the interest I'll accrue isn't worth the expedited build-up of the emergency fund?**

personalfinance,"Mid-twenties, doing ok financially, but trying to figure out how to prioritize different financial goals.","Hello and thank you for taking the time to read/provide feedback. Overall I am very fortunate and am doing ok financially.  However, I still have concerns and feel like I could/should be saving more.  I have 3 sort of complicated questions that I list at the end.  I’ve also included my savings, assets, debts, and budget in case these are needed to help answer my questions. 

I graduated from college 3 years ago debt free due to a combination of financial help from parents, scholarships, and working part time during school.  I got a job right out of college making $60k and started saving fairly aggressively. 2 years ago I decided to make a leap and buy a house.  Looking back I probably should have waited longer but at the time I was sick of renting and thought buying would be a better financial decision.  I bought a nice but modest 3 bedroom house for $199k and only put 5% down.  Closing costs and expenses associated with moving wiped out most of my savings.  For a year I was pretty much living paycheck to paycheck.  I paid my credit cards in full and never fell behind on any of my debts but I was one emergency away from financial disaster.  I realized I needed to be more responsible with my money and started using YNAB to track my spending.  I also got a roommate which brought another $500 in each month.  

Now I am in a much better financial spot.  However, I am finding it difficult to maintain such strict control over my budget and I am tempted to start spending again.  I got promoted a few months ago and my income has increased significantly (now $92k).  I increased my 401k contributions so my paycheck only increased by ~$700/month.  Around the time of my promotion my roommate decided to move out. I have not tried to find a new roommate and quite honestly I really don’t want to because it would be a random person off the street this time, not a friend, and I’m not sure if the extra money is worth the risk. 


**Current Savings**

$35,000 in 401k (Company contributes 4% which is vested immediately.  I am planning to max out my contributions in 2015 and going forward)

$3,500 in Roth IRA ($2,000 of which is from 2015 contributions)

$10,000 emergency fund + $2,000 buffer 

Pension through work.  I’m not sure how much this is worth.  



**Assets**

3 year old car valued at ~$10,000

Home valued around $230k to 250k based on what similar homes in my neighborhood are selling at



**Debts**

$177,819.92 outstanding on mortgage @ 3.5% with 331 months remaining



**Budget**

My bi-weekly take home pay is $1,867.45.  I budget assuming 2 paychecks per month.  Whenever 3 pay periods fall in a month I throw the majority of that extra paycheck at savings and some at fun activities.  I also get an annual bonus of up to 10% based on company performance.  This is paid every March.  Historically we’ve received ~5%.

**Questions**

*1. Do I really need to worry about fully maxing out my Roth IRA for 2015 if I am already maxing out my 401k (+ company match of 4% as well as a pension)?*  I have already contributed $2,000 to a Roth IRA in 2015 and am going to be maxing out my 401k ($18k).  I feel obligated to try to fully max out my Roth IRA but doing so would limit my ability to save for other goals.  My carpet is getting really old and I would like to replace it with hardwood flooring.  I already got quotes and this would cost $8,000 (3 bedrooms, living room, and hallway).  I feel ridiculous blowing that much money but it is something I have wanted to do since buying the house 2 years ago.  I am considering saving extra $1,000 per month in October through March as well as my expected $2,000 bonus and using that money to get the hardwood in March.  I would still have an extra paycheck in December that I could throw at my Roth IRA which would bring my contributions up to $3,500 for the year.  My other option would be to delay getting hardwood for two months and applying my October and November savings towards my Roth IRA.  Although 2 months is not that long, I am already really anxious to replace the carpeting and don’t want to push it off any further.  Additionally, pushing it back would also decrease my months that I’m saving for my 2016 contributions, forcing me to save $785.71 of my $1,000 per month during June-December to max out my 2016 Roth IRA. In the long run will not contributing that extra $2,000 to my Roth IRA really negatively impact my retirement if I’m already maxing out my 401k and plan to max out my IRA going forward? 


*2. How should I prioritize general savings vs. paying off my mortgage ahead of schedule?* I am currently paying PMI on my mortgage (bad, I know) so I have been trying to pay off extra to get that dropped sooner.  I’ve already talked to my credit union and as soon as I hit 80% of the original purchase price I can send them a letter and they will drop the PMI otherwise it will automatically fall off when it hits 78%.  I paid $199k for the house and put 5% down so my original mortgage is for $189,050 and I need to get down to $159,200 to drop PMI. I currently owe $177,819.92 ($18,619.92 left until I drop PMI) and my interest rate is 3.5%.  My required monthly payment is $1,399.81 ($848.92 Principal &amp; Interest + $550.89 Taxes &amp; Insurance) but I have been paying $1,500.  Right now only ~ $435 of that $1,500 is going towards reducing the principal. I feel like I should be throwing more money at my mortgage since I’m currently wasting $85 a month on PMI.  However, I also want to save for retirement and increase my general emergency fund (not to mention save for other things such as hardwood floor).  How do I figure out how much I should be applying to my mortgage vs. saving elsewhere? 


*3. When is it worth getting an MBA?* The majority of my peers and almost everyone above me at work has a MBA.  I am not sure if it would be worth it for me to get one.  I am already making a lot and I’m not sure getting an MBA would increase my pay enough to offset the expense.  There is a well-respected evening MBA program at a local university but the tuition/fees over the course of the 3 years would be almost $80k.  There is also a local state school that is not as prestigious but still respected.  This program offers a hybrid of in person and online and is more flexible.  The total cost would probably be ~$30k but I could spread it across 4 or 5 years.  My work reimburses up to $3,000 per year for tuition so the first program would be ~$70k and the second program could be as low as $15k if I spread it across 5 years. I tried doing a cost benefit analysis to help decide but I could figure out concrete numbers to enter for the benefit.  Completing a MBA has no guarantee that my salary would increase.  However, I assume it would be advantageous to have especially if I want to enter management. How do I calculate if it’s worth it in my situation?",finance,1444415233

investing,"If you have a long time horizon, why should you hold ANY bonds?","Hi investing reddit,

&amp;nbsp;

Forgive me if this is a ""noob"" question but I don't quite understand this concept: if my goal is to invest long term, why would I want to hold ANY bonds versus keeping cash. I understand fundamentally how bonds work and I understand the ""conventional wisdom"" that says you should hold SOME bonds. 

&amp;nbsp;

However this argument makes too much sense to me: 

Consider today, where I can buy a 10-year government treasury bond at approximately a 2% interest rate. The only way I could gain on the bond principal itself is if interest rates go down (unlikely). Otherwise, I can expect a modest return over time and I can sell the bond if I decide I can invest it in something else.

&amp;nbsp;

The problem is, it seems like I could ALWAYS invest it in a dividend-generating stock that has a higher return. To mitigate the risk of companies going under/companies stopping giving dividends, I instead invest in a &gt;2% dividend ETF. It's possible that I could suddenly get 0% dividend (+ the ETF value goes to 0), but it seems terribly unlikely.

&amp;nbsp;

Given these things, why would I EVER want to hold a bond? I understand that it's basically like a cash equivalent, but isn't it just easier if I hold the cash and wait for opportunities? Am I just hedging against the ""end of the stock market world""?",finance,1444417756

My personal annual income is nothing special, but it's enough. However, this mediocre income is what may or may not qualify me for these rebates. **What I need to know is if my roommates annual income affects my total household income.**

personalfinance,Faster ways to pay off credit card debt?,"Hi everyone, 


I am a graduate student on a stipend (paid once monthly) and although it is supposed to cover living costs, it is barely enough so I have to be very careful to stay within my means. I'm usually pretty good about that, but long story short, I accumulated some credit card debt. I bought a new laptop (that I need for work and my old one that was 6+ years old died) and I had to move and pay the deposit and first month's rent upfront. It's not much by most people's standards but is a lot of money for me and I hate the idea of having a debt to pay. I've been paying more than the minimum balance, and as much as I can for the last three months since the move but it's just not going down! I went out and got 2 part time jobs that I am just starting to get paid for and that money is also going towards/will go towards the debt. 

Income:

Stipend: $1300/mo

Fast food job: $400/mo

Bus driving: $800/mo

Total: $2500




Expenses: $960.00

Debt: $2000


In theory, I should be able to pay everything off in like 2 months, but it never seems to work out that way.
I do not have student loans or anything besides the credit card. I am financially independent, but my parents would be able to help me out in an emergency so I'd rather pay this off then use the extra money to build my savings/emergency fund again. 


Do you think I will be alright as soon as I start getting my regular paychecks (after the pay lag that comes with a new job)? Are there any other creative, or not so creative ways I can pay this faster/pay less interest? Is it even an option to try for a loan at my bank with a lower interest rate? Or is that worse when the card could be paid off soon enough?

It's hard to predict how much she'll make in a month but she's still trying to get herself established so it probably averages out to around ¥80,000 to ¥100,000 per month. She's working remotely for Japanese clients because her English isn't fully there. We have no immediate plans to move back to Japan but it may happen in the distant future.
I have around $30,000 in student debt at interest rates from 3 to 6.5%ish. My wife has around 6,000,000 yen in student debt at 1% interest. We have no other debts or savings.

politics,Why the DNC and CNN excluding Lessig from the Democratic debates is utterly unjustifiable (with footnotes),"""There is no earthly logic as far as I can tell for a Democratic presidential debate to give a podium slot to say Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee but not Lawrence Lessig... It appears like the Democratic National Committee or a cable news network are essentially unnecessarily playing gate keeper about what ideas people should and shouldn't see."" - [Chris Hayes of MSNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ilh8DNouPo)

While Clinton and Sanders (with Biden, if he enters) are clearly on top, support for O'Malley, Lessig, Webb, and Chafee is statistically indistinguishable.[1] After them, there's a huge dropoff to the fringe candidates who have received no media attention at all, have not been included in a single poll, and have no paid staff.[2] So the *only* justifiable debate lineup includes those top six (setting Biden to one side), other than perhaps a prematurely narrow faceoff between Clinton and Sanders.

Instead, the DNC/CNN criteria, outrageously, draw the line between Webb/Chafee and Lessig. If anything, it would make more sense to include Lessig and exclude Webb and Chafee, because Lessig's campaign is stronger by any measure (other than DNC support, as discussed below):

* Lessig has ""demonstrated broad-based support"" by qualifying for federal matching funds, unlike Webb and Chafee.[3]
* Lessig's fundraising has far outpaced both Webb and (especially) Chafee.[4]
* In the four major polls that include Lessig, his average support is higher than Chafee's (though, again, the differences are much smaller than the margin of error).[5]
* Lessig has attracted a top flight campaign staff.[6]
* Lessig is already running TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire.[7]

So it is no exaggeration to say it is absurd to draw a line between Lessig and Chafee *and put Lessig below that line*. How do the DNC and CNN justify that line, then? They insist that they cannot change the criteria they announced over a month ago, particularly the requirement that a candidate receive an average of at least 1% support across his top three major poll results.[8] Nevermind that the debate inclusion rules have been modified shortly before each of the two previous primary debates when it became obvious changes were needed. The first Republican debate eliminated its similar polling criteria completely. The second debate, hosted by CNN (!), changed its polling rules when Fiorina pointed out their unfairness shortly beforehand. CNN could obviously do the same for Lessig.

Let's take a closer look at that rule they are instead insisting on. Again, it requires 1% support across your *top three* results from major polls. That ""top three results"" part makes all the difference for the 3-4 candidates barely registering in national polls. Because the margin of error is around 5%, being included in enough polls virtually guarantees they will receive 1% in three of them, by random chance alone! Because Chafee was included in 18 major polls, he managed to qualify despite receiving 0% in most of them. Lessig beat Chafee in the major polls that included them both, but Lessig was only included in four polls recognized by CNN. He ends up excluded by this rule because the rule is functionally equivalent to including any candidate listed in major polls. 

The root cause of Lessig's exclusion, then, is that the major media conglomerates left his name off their polls, taking their cues from the DNC. Lessig's relative strength over Webb and Chafee was clear at the launch of his campaign, which came after raising $1 M in just four weeks. But the DNC refused to publicly welcome him to the campaign, as they did for the other major candidates.[11] The major polls are refusing to answer questions about why they excluded Lessig even after his impressive and widely reported entry into the race. But, given that there is no other measure by which Lessig's campaign is weaker than Webb's or (especially) Chafee's, it is reasonable to infer that the DNC's snub played a major role in their decision.

To sum up, the DNC and CNN set up a debate rule which essentially includes all candidates consistently included in major polls. Then the DNC and CNN (together with other major media corporations) prevented Lessig from being consistently included in major polls. They could change the debate invite rules tomorrow if they wanted to, just as they have before. But they refuse to make the obvious change this time, leaving us to ask, ""Why?""

personalfinance,Charitable giving versus keeping,"Greetings all!

As background, I am a fourth generation Utah Mormon, and active in my local congregation. I am also an agnostic with a fairly strong atheistic bent. I realize these seem at odds with each other, but it is what it is.

I want to ask a question of the group regarding my financial behavior, and what y'all do with charitable giving.

I was raised with a strong charitable drive. As Mormons, we tithe 10% (gross or net is up to interpretation, and for me its been on net income) to the church, with additional funds given towards supporting the charitable actions of the church as well as missionary activities. Since some of the political actions over the last decade, I haven't felt comfortable giving a full 10% to the church, and have instead diverted the majority of my 10% to local and national charities.

I am a physician (~225K / yr, may advance to more like 350 over the next few years) and have battled my student loans down to ~100K. We live in a $260K home with a $200K mortgage, and have our EF and fund the 53K of 401k etc each year. Extra funds have gone towards student loans instead of taxable accounts. I also had a $90K buy-in this last year, so we're otherwise not flush with excess cash. 

I have ~15K set aside in a charitable savings account to be donated by the end of the year. I do want to give some to my church as I have benefited from their buildings and such this year, however I am now trying to figure out for myself how much I should give to charity, instead of keeping with what the church had taught me as a youth. It is certainly tempting to view myself as a needy charity with that 100K in loans (wasn't that a millionaire behavior in Millionaire Next Door?) Loans are all federal and at 6.55% interest.

So here're my questions - how much do you donate annually, and specifically what should I do with this $15K? I'll absolutely still give a few thousand in tithing and a few to the Mormon charities, but with the remaining 10K what would you recommend? Give it to Medicine Sans Frontiers (or the Utah Food Bank) or pay down some loans?

I do have a new one with a different company for my new job.

I don't know much about investing, but I have noticed it has been on a slight decline lately.

Questions:

I know the Feds are supposed to raise interest rates soon (supposedly). How will this affect my meager little nest egg, if at all?

What are my options for investing this? Should I keep it with Fidelity? Move it into my new one? Roll it into something else?

The interest rate is 19.80% so I want it get it paid off ASAP. I'm having a hard time finding the extra money to pay each month to chip away at it as paying the minimum does nothing. 

I have my own retirement account that I voluntarily fund. I deposit $150 per month. I also have a very low car payment of $165 per month. Since its so low, I pay $250 total per month to pay it off quicker. The apr on that is 3.5%. 

Here is my question: should I suspend my contributions to my retirement account and only pay the minimum on my car so that I can use the extra $235 per month to pay down my credit card? 

Along with the minimum payment of $60, I would be paying about $300 per month to the credit card which would have it paid off in about 7 months. That means 7 months without a retirement contribution or the extra payment to principle on my car.

Long time lurker and first time poster (using a throwaway.) I'd like personal finance's thoughts on how I stand currently and how to allocate funds in my 401k, that's assuming the 401k is the best plan for me.

* Age: 25

* Location: San Francisco Bay Area

* Yearly salary: $65,000 (paid twice a month)

* Checking balance: $1000

* Savings balance (emergency fund): $4000

* ~$1000 in US bonds (grandma purchased them for me when I was a baby.)

* I own my own car (worth about $6,000) and pay $600/year for insurance.

* I pay $400/month in rent to my father (includes food.)

* I have zero long term credit card debt and no student loans. I do have a BofA Cash Rewards card that I use for almost all purchases that has $1000 on it and will be paid off by EOM.

* I owed $2,500 to my father a month ago but have knocked that down to $1000 by paying it in $500 increments with every paycheck. This is a zero interest loan.

* I also owe about $2,000 to my mother (another zero interest loan) that I will begin paying off $500 at a time when I finish paying my father back.

I think that covers all the basics of my current finances, if I've left anything out please let me know and I'll update it.

My question really comes with what to do now. My goal is to have $5,000 in my savings account as my emergency fund and I should meet that goal by the end of this month or early next month. Paying off my parents is something I've been waiting 3 years to do and I want to finish ASAP. I want to be debt free, even if the debt I have accrues no interest, I owe it to them.

The 401k plan at my work does not match. I just enrolled and elected to contribute 10% at least to start out with. The default fund to invest in is the T.

They have the available funds broken down into four categories - income, growth and income, growth, and aggressive growth. What's the difference between them?

personalfinance,17 years old. Cannot afford car payment currently due to unemployment. Car in moms name. Threatening to give it back. I need help and advice on how to move forward with this.,"Hi /r/personalfinance ! 

I am a long time lurker and poster. This is a throwaway account that I have just created to keep my identity private for this one post. What I'm about to tell you all is a pretty big financial mistake. I understand that I made mistake(s) but I'm looking for a way to get around it the right way, if at all possible. 

I am 17 years old (yikes!). I had started working and my mom said that she would get me a car and let me make monthly payments on it. I agreed. Her credit isn't good, to be honest, hence the 18% interest rate. The car payment is $400 monthly since we didn't have a down payment. They wouldn't bring the price down since we didn't have a down payment. The car is a 2011 and very nice. I won't go into detail though. 

Some stuff happened and I ended up quitting my job and I've already applied for 10+ places for a new one. I have made about 4 or 5 payments on it. My mom is threatening to just give it back to the dealer as a voluntary repossession. I love the car but I was wondering what to do? She's giving me until the end of October to find a new job or she's giving it back. I did some research and found on KBB that the car would go for ~$10,000+ to a dealer and ~$12,500+ to a private party. I/we still owe ~$16,500 Prínciple balance. 

What should we do from here? If I had to get rid of it, I would put aside $400 a month until I could find a cheap late 90's or early 00's on Craigslist or something for $1800-$2000. 

My mother cannot afford the monthly payment of the $400 as well as her other bills. 

What do you all think I/we should do? 


I understand I've made mistakes but just really need advice on how to move forward with this.

We want to buy a 80-100K(EUR) house, for which we currently have a 40K downpayment(for the upper price range). We plan to increase that in the next year by another 10-15K.

We tried to save as much as possible in the past years, targeting a &gt;50% downpayment for the house(my family has a really bad history with bank loans and I avoided taking one until now).


Housing prices in our city dropped by ~30% between 2008-2013, and recovered ~15% in the past two years. Despite increasing our savings significantly in the past year, we only increased a potential downpayment by a few percent.

If the prices go up by another 10% in the following year, we will be losing money by buying after getting married, compared to now.

Other info:

- our rent is about 15% of our combined income

- we look into having a mortgage payment similar or lower to our current rent

- mortgage interest rate is 4-4.5%(actually lowest in many years, but high compared to other countries since it depends on local currency)

- national economic growth and modifications in financial laws will favor housing market growth

- the city economy developed quite a bit in the past few years

We see the following options:

1. Wait and buy after we get married, with the risk of spending more.

2. Panic and try to buy as soon as we find something we like in the upcoming months. Then try to pay as much as 
we can towards the principal.

3. Buy now, make normal payments, but try to find other usages for potential future savings.

4. Buy a lower-end house(50-80K), but with a larger percentage for downpayment, then maybe move out to something else after a few years.

What's your input on this? Anyone that had similar experiences in the past?",finance,1444512484
personalfinance,I'm unhappy at my college for the price I am paying. I want to transfer but my parents refuse to consider it. How can I argue with them using finances?,"I am a first year Out-Of-State student at a prestigious engineering school, however this was never the school I wanted to go to. I wanted to go to an instate school that I felt was a better fit for me academically and socially (and much much cheaper). However my parents are very big on rank and reputation and threatened to withdraw any financial support for me as well as pressured me through relatives and friends and I ended up resignedly committing to the out of state school.

My family is definitely not rich (Dad found a job just two years ago) and we are sinking almost all our savings (28k) plus around 15k in gift money from relatives in order to pay for my first year in college.
I am told that hereafter I will have to take out full loans for the next three years.



Here are some facts:

Tuition: 30,000

Room &amp; Board: 13,000

Scholarships: 0

Federal Loans: 3,000

Major: Computer Science

In state school cost: 4,000 (tuition) + 10,000 (room and board)

Family income: 110,000

We just bought a 500k house two years ago.

Two younger siblings

As far as I'm aware very small savings



The primary reason I want to transfer is because I feel I am overpaying for a college experience I am simply not enjoying (both inside and outside the classroom).  Additionally I believe it is unfair that I have to shoulder the burden of repaying loans for a college I didn't even (and still don't) want to attend.

Whenever I bring up my concerns about taking out full loans for the next three years (which should be 100k to 150k dollars), my parents say I am foolish and naive and that it is easily repayable. 

My mother argues that if I earn 10k a summer from internships and live frugally once I graduate I should easily repay it. I have linked her websites cautioning taking too much debt but she claims that white people don't know how to manage finances (we are a first generation asian family). She claims that I can get a much better job from my current school than from the instate school. I am both uneasy about trusting her and still discontent with having to shoulder this burden for something I never wanted.

personalfinance,My husband thinks it's better to pay off debt slowly and I think he's insane. Is there any truth to this idea?,"So he gave me the example of having a debt that you pay off over ten years. His idea is that because money loses its value over time due to inflation, it's better to pay debt off slowly because for something like his school loan, the loan interest rate is less than the inflation rate. So why take a large hit all at once when you can get it paid off gradually since it's losing value with time or something like that? I hope someone can explain this insanity to me. I made every counter argument I can think of: get rid of debt quickly, avoid the debt getting bigger due to unforseen things, less bills per month, use the interest money to invest, you name it I said it. Can someone tell me why he's dead wrong so I can rub his face in it? Or I guess why I'm wrong so I stop second guessing my marriage? Or we're both wrong? Thanks!",finance,1444516170
personalfinance,Advice needed for student loan repayment...Grace period ending soon,"Hi PF, I could use some advice regarding the smartest way to go about paying off my student loans.  My grace period is ending in December for most of my loans.  I am already making payments of $278.33 per month because I took a year off during college, so I already used the grace status during that time off. As of today my total student loan debt is $72,880.61.  $51,809.14 of that is federal, and $21,071.47 is private.  Here is the breakdown:

Private (Navient):
$3800.38 (3800 principal), 7.5% IR, unsubsidized, Grace status until Dec; paying $25/mo until then.
$8192.20 (7300 principal), 8.5% IR, unsub, current payments of $121.82/mo
$5623.77 (4500 principal), 9% IR, unsub, current payments of 106.51/mo

Private (Sallie Mae):
$3455.12 (3500 principal), 7.5% IR, grace status until Dec, current payments of $25/mo, repayment term 96 months

Federal (Direct Unsub)
$22,373.30 (19,347.63 principal + 3025.67 accrued interest), 6.8% IR, in Administrative Forbearance (not sure why)
$2,141.61 (2000 principal + 141.61 accrued interest during year off), 3.86% IR, grace until Dec.
$5,337.38 (5000 + 337.38 accrued interest during year off), 3.86% IR, grace until Dec.
$7,273.52 (7000 + 273.52 accrued interest during year off), 3.86% IR, grace until Dec.

Federal (Direct Sub)
$3,596.15 (5500 + 96.15 accrued interest during year off), 4.5% IR, in Admin. Forbearance (not sure why)
$5,587.18 (5500 + 87.18 accrued during year off), 3.86% IR, grace until Dec.
$5,500; 4.66% IR, grace until Dec.

My current salary is $28,000 and I live in the US. My ideas right now are to sign up for income based repayment and/or consolidation.  However, I am certainly no expert, so I am open to all suggestions.  I should probably also note that I have about $1,000 in my savings so far from saving 10% of each paycheck, and put 10% of my pay toward my 403(b).  After rent, food, gas, and other necessities I am fairly certain I wouldn't be able to afford the loan payments come December as they currently stand.

First of all, I'd like to thank everyone for contributing to three excellent AMAs last week. I'm thrilled to say that we had absolutely phenomenal participation, particularly in terms of comment quality. For that, I'd like to commend you all.

Special thanks goes to [Gil Troy](/u/giltroy), for successfully being our guinea pig, and hosting the first serious AMA that /r/politics has done in two years. Gil's agent even said ""I’ve done a lot of these with authors, and this was one of the smoothest.""

[Steve Gladstone](/u/stevegladstone) also deserves a special thanks, as he pulled off a fantastic performance, answering questions non-stop for just over six hours.

So I have been pretty wrong for the last few years thinking the increasing leverage, stock buy backs and PrivateE, Tech valuations are going to bring a lot of trouble for financial institutions.

If the Fed doesn't increase rates, and even follows with another QE I feel like companies are just going to use it to buy more stocks back on leverage.
It also looks like easy unsecured (or share backed) credit to companies like glencore are then going to continue.

With commodities at these levels and the strong dollar isn't deflation inevitable either way?

Wouldn't be increasing interest rates tame debt which otherwise domino fall and tighten credit and spending even more?

I went to graduate school between 2009-2011, and applied for federal loans to help with tuition and cost of living. I was approved for about $7k over the two years, and am currently paying those back. However, I also apparently applied for a perkins loan in the amount of $3000. I have no memory of applying for that, or for any of that being approved, but suddenly I'm getting calls from a collections agency that I assumed was a scam until the debt showed up on one of my credit reports. (Equifax only, not Transunion) I called the college bursar's office, and they confirmed this debt, and eventually mailed me a letter that included information on how to access this account. On the website heartlandecsi.com, I see an electronically signed master promissory note, with all of my personal information, and it says $1500 of the $3000 applied for was disbursed on 3/16/11, so it all looks legitimate. Still, I have no memory of any of this, so I recently contacted my bank at the time, who confirmed no deposit in that amount occurred at any time around that date. I will be calling heartland ECSI tomorrow to see what options I have. 

I am very perplexed. I don't know how it's possible that I applied for a loan and forgot about it entirely (though I was younger and overwhelmed so who knows). But I'm also curious as to how it took them so long to contact me about the balance, I heard nothing before it went to collections, and why it only shows up on one of my credit reports.

personalfinance,Question about loans and inflation.,"My mom and I are having trouble coming to an agreement about our loans. Here is the scenario:

Lets say,
-We have a retirement account of 435,000 earning 3.5% Interest
-We have a Home Equity Loan of 35,000 at 3.25% interest.
-Inflation is 1% per year.

My mom says that because the retirement account is earning a higher interest rate than the home equity loan is charging us, it is a positive cash flow.
However I say that because inflation is higher than the .25% difference between the interest rates on the 2 monies, we are losing money to inflation every year. Therefore, to ""beat inflation"" we should take money from the retirement account to pay off the home equity loan. If we did that, we are now earning 3.5% Interest on 400k  and have no home equity loan, so we are now ""beating inflation"" by 2.5% per year. Even if my scenario does not come out ahead in the short term, it should win in the long term.
I know my mom is probably right because inflation affects everyone across the board, but I can't shake the logic of my scenario from my head.
I am wondering what everyone here thinks. Thank you!

personalfinance,"I'm having a problem with Comcast. They keep dicking me around and overcharging me, please help!","For months now Comcast has been overcharging me for services I don't want or need. For a couple years I was having problems with my television service and had to deal with comcast customer service way more than I would like, so one day I was fed up. I cancelled my television service and wanted only internet. The problem was they didn't change the service and the next month I was billed for both television and cable. I called and asked them to change the bill and they said they would and would send me a new one. A couple days later I got a call from another rep saying that it would be less expensive to do television and internet. At this point looking back I knew I shouldn't do it, but I did anyway. The next month the bill comes and it STILL has the overcharged fee, plus a more expensive fee for the television than I was told by the agent. I called back and they said they would fix the problem and send me a new bill, but now I'm being charged late fees for bills I have not paid because they were overcharged and STILL getting charged too much. 


What do I do? I don't want this to affect my credit, but I refuse to pay the overcharged rate on principle. I also am tired of calling customer service and waiting half an hour to get hung up on or switched to another rep who I have to talk to for an hour before having nothing changed.


TL,DR:  Comcast has been overcharging me for services since August, and after +5 hours of talking to customer service am still being overcharged and being charged late fees.

Edit: Spacing

Edit: UPDATE: I sent a complaint to the FCC and was reached out to by an employee via REDDIT who gave me a special fast track number to call in to. The woman was friendly but insisted that there was nothing she could do and that what was reflected in my account did not match the bill I had in my hands. I'm so frustrated at this point that I just paid the amount due (~$350). I am not happy about it, and know that it just reinforces Comcast's model that it can do whatever the fuck it wants and is so big that there's nothing one can do about it. I'm just too worried it will negatively affect my credit and that it's not worth the headache to me.

First let me give you an overview on m background so you can get an idea of what I'm dealing with here.

I was born in Venezuela and, like many other, had to flee because of the socioeconomic disaster that the country has turned into.

In Venezuela, one barely plans personal finances, 2 and 3 digit inflation rates basically destroy any budget and what you usually do is max your credit to finance assets (cars, cell phones, etc.) to later sell them and make a nice profit. 

The highest interest rate you can find are on credit cards at 29% whereas inflation rate is about 90-120% (no official rates since january).

Long story short, I'm not used to plan a thorough budget, wich makes it hard to start tracking all expenses and income.

personalfinance,Amended tax return - problem with fed income tax withheld,"Throwaway because this is embarrassing that I can't figure this out.

Background if it matters: In 2013 I obtained my first full-time job. At the time, I was working part-time at a different organization that is within the same system as the organization I work for now. During my first week, Organization 1 failed to roll my electronic time card (because I switched organizations in the middle of a 2-week pay period) to Organization 2; chaos ensued, and I was underpaid by Organization 2 and overpaid by Organization 1. I straightened it out, was cut a check by Organization 2 to make up for the amount they did not pay me, and I had to write a check to Organization 1 for the money they overpaid me (some $230).

The problem: 2014 rolls around and I file my taxes for 2013. After I file, I get a corrected W2 from Organization 1, as the original W2 had the extra $230 I ended up paying back to Organization 1. I discover I have to file an amended tax return, for fed and state. I used TurboTax to file, and I used the TurboTax program to fill out the amended return. The amended W2 is pretty much blank except for this information: corrected Wages, tips, other compensation (box 1); State wages, tips, etc. (box 16), and State income tax (box 17). I thought it was weird that the corrected W2 didn't include box 2, for federal income tax withheld. I fill out the amended 1040X and the program asks me to add the corrected information for box 1 and box 2. The corrected W2 doesn't provide a corrected box 2. I discover that if I don't enter any information in box 2, I owe something like $150. If I enter the box 2 information from the first W2 I obtained from Organization 1, then they owe me something like $9.

My confusion stems from the fact that I don't know what to put in box 2 on the amended 1040X. From my logic -- which could well be wrong -- I don't think I owe any money. Do I enter the federal income tax withheld from the first W2, or leave it blank because the corrected W2 didn't included a corrected federal income tax withheld? 

I'm ok with not filing it just to get my money back if it's just $10. If I owe money, though, I would like to correct everything and pay whatever I owe for obvious reasons. Is it too late for me to file this for 2013 without racking up fees from the IRS?",finance,1444601769

My parents have been handling all of that but today my mother gave me a letter that from Great Lakes with all of the loan info. 

So I have 4 Parent PLUS loans with these interest rates:

* $36,745.00    7.9%
* $39,000.00     6.41%
* $25,000.00     7.21%
* $51,611.00     6.84%

And 4 Sallie Mae loans:

* $17,493.00  6.75% (fixed)
* $3,394.13    8.75% (variable)
* $1,485.88    8.50% (variable)
* $892.74       7.50% (variable)

I'm currently an Engineering Management major at Stevens Institute in Hoboken.

I work part-time at least 24 hours a week, sometimes more, at $15/hour. 

I still have another 1.5 years after this semester ends before i get my degree. What should I do in terms of future loans and about the current ones I have now.

personalfinance,The impossibility of refinancing,"I have a massive amount of student loans (current balance at $170,000). I am working two jobs to make reduced payments, and I haven't missed a payment yet (Thankfully). However, I am still living paycheck-to-paycheck and having to ocassionally borrowing money from my parents to make a payment.

I would like to lower my month-to-month burden. Refinancing seems like the only option, since I am unable to lower the amount at will. My parents co-signed the loan, but have since run into financial trouble (credit cards, extremely low credit score, etc), so we've been rejected for every refinancing attempt we've tried. I've heard people talking about getting a credit card with a low interest rate to make payments then pay back the credit card, but that just seems like a bad idea. My parents have tried to dip into their home equity, but that hasn't worked either. 

Is there a way to transfer the loans to myself without my parents on them, since my credit score is currently doing fine? Is there any other recourse to lower my monthly burden short of just getting more income?

personalfinance,Tax Help - Thinking In Advance,"Hi!

First of all sorry if this is the wrong place. I couldn't find anywhere better.

I'm trying to get all of my things in order so that when tax time comes, everything will go smoothly.

I had a full time job making 1700 pre-tax every month. The company shut down a couple of weeks ago and they have withheld 1148.63 (ONLY for federal taxes - medicaid/etc are separate) from my paychecks so far. I have made a total of 14747.67 from them this year. 

I also have a few side ventures,
1- Phone repair - Operating at net zero. No profit this year.
2- 1099 contract where I got $800 profit off a $2000 check.
3- 1099 contract where I made $600 but spent it all on business expenses.

With my phone repair business I was thinking I'd deduct the startup equipment costs (&gt;$3000) and appropriate amount of rent/electricity/car (since I drive to customers) - This would total around $5k, if not more.

SO basically I'm thinking I'm going to have a lot of deductions. Should I be doing the taxes myself, or should I find a CPA? Since I have withheld around a 1000 my goal is to get as much money back, or if needed, pay as little as possible. 

PS- Just remembered, My friend from India used my US bank account to transfer $7k to the UK through. This was 100$ legal (not money laundering) and was simply due to convenience. Obviously I wouldn't like to pay taxes on this, and the money was moved out of my account the very next day. Could this be a problem?",finance,1444610947

So, here is my situation: I live with my girlfriend and starting next year, we are planning on saving around $50,000 a year.

However, I am pretty averse to the idea of having dozens of thousands of dollars sitting in a saving account with a shitty interest rate.

personalfinance,Should I have more than one credit card? How many?,"I've always been in favor of having one credit card so that everything is simpler for me.  Unfortunately it seems that this has come back to bite me.  After being fed up with the security at my old bank, I went to a new one who gave me one extra letter in my password and allowed special characters and opened up an account.  I found having 2 cards wasn't a big deal, but I ended up putting everything on my new rewards card instead of splitting between the two.  After I made a rather large donation on my old card via paypal (since my new card has a really low limit), apparently it was stolen and I just ended up canceling it as the bank wasn't anywhere near where I currently live.

A few months after my previous card was stolen, right as I'm moving into a new place/buying furniture, my new credit card was also stolen.  Now I'm in a situation without a credit card, and my phone bills are due, cable, netflix, etc...

Over the past 3 months I've been putting ~$2000-$3000/month on the card, and actually hit my limit of $3400 by accident because of two hotel bills for work.  Hopefully now I'll drop back down to a fairly typical $1000/month.  I just received the replacement card and went ahead and changed the recurring payments I have (and I now have a list of all the recurring payments I have in case something like this happens again). I'm wondering if I should go ahead and sign up for multiple cards so I'm less likely to have this happen again?

* A card to pay for recurring payments (netflix, cable, cell phones, $100/month)
* A general use card for day to day purchases ($600-$800/month)
* A card for travel/business expenses/emergencies ($0-$3000/month, varies based on work)

Is this a good idea?  Last I checked I had a credit score of 790, but I did cancel 2 cards after this result, but that shouldn't affect it too much.

personalfinance,How I convinced Corporation to waive $116 interest on my credit card,"**I bought a laptop** at Pesky Guy last September for $700. 12 months no interest if the balance is paid off in full at the end of the year. I see my bill jump from $40 remaining balance to $200 remaining balance this month. What? Oh, ok, I have a $116 interest charged in the PAST MONTH on a $40 BALANCE!!! 


Why? Because the interest accrues over the full year and is slapped down if the balance isn't paid in full over 12 months. 

Here's the reason I am posting- 
**You gotta read your statements, and you gotta contact customer service when something like this happens.** 

**I chatted online**, complained that their system quickly emails me when a payment is due, but cannot warn me in advance when I'm about to be subjected to high interest rates. 

**I told them** that at that price, I will certainly default on my payments, because I cannot afford to pay. 

**I offered** to settle by paying off the principle in full today, if they completely wave the interest. 

**I waited** 2 minutes or less, and Pesky Guy accepted my offer. 

Friends: Corporate America knows that people are absent-minded and will not pay attention to crazy charges. They also bet on people using auto pay and not realizing when they are paying too much. 

I did an automatic transfer from my bank account for all payments. Pesky Guy DID NOT have my debit/credit card information. I cannot stress how important that was in this scenario. Otherwise I would have been duped and/or needed to fight the charge on a credit card. If they took payments from my debit card, it would have been almost impossible to get that money back.

personalfinance,Weighing between fixing current car or buying used car.,"My current car is a 2004 Chevy sedan with 165k miles on it.  It will need new struts within the year, but my current issue is on startup.  It has issues starting that are not battery related, which worries me with winter coming.  

I'm 22 and fresh out of college working as a consultant at a software company making 40k a year.  I commute about 30 miles each way to work.  My initial plan was to use my bonus money from (coming Dec-Jan, 5-15% of my salary) as a down payment on a newer car.  I didn't anticipate having these engine issues as early as I'm seeing them (car doesn't like starting when it's cold, but figured it would be ok till it actually started getting cold).  I'm thinking I might be in a position where I have to buy a newer car before my bonus arrives because I don't want to have to put any significant money into my current car. 

I have about 5k in the bank, and my credit score is 710, though my only history are my two credit cards that I've had (one for 15 months, the other for 6).  I'm looking at small hatchbacks like Fiestas, Elantras, Fits, etc under 10k.  My current insurance is 80 a month with Geico(under 25 male, live in a city), I priced a 2013 Fiesta and that rate doubled at my current coverage(seen below).  I budgeted 275-300 a month for insurance and payments should I have to buy a car.  

What would be the best thing to do given my current situation?  My parents advice was to get an estimate on the repairs needed, and then go from there.  I was wondering given my lack of credit history, what I could reasonably expect for an interest rate and how much of my current money I should put down.  I went to a local dealership, and they quoted me at between 5 and 8%.  Also would it be worth it to sacrifice a bit on my current coverage to save on insurance?

Current coverage:
Bodily Injury, uninsured, underinsured 100,000/300,000
Property - 50,000
PA limited tort
No comprehensive or collision

personalfinance,Looking for advice on checking account / best APY,"Hi there. So I currently use Cash Management Account with Fidelity. Didn't really care about APY. But the reimbursed ATM fees was the kicker for me.

I've been meaning to switch to Ally for the longest time. I'd still get ATM reimbursements, but 1% APY is certainly nice. I do keep my emergency fund in my bank account, so it would collect that interest. I just haven't gotten around to switching to Ally from Fidelity.

However, through /r/churning, I recently heard about LMCU (Lake Michigan Credit Union), where you can sign up regardless of where you live, and you can get up to 3% APY if you do a certain # of things (check your account every so often, get direct deposit a few times, use your debit card, etc). That's quite a good APY for up to $15,000 (just over what I keep in my rainy day fund), so I've been thinking about using that.

I'm just wondering, anyone else use LMCU and have thoughts/comments? I've also heard about up to 5% APY for up to $5000 via DoC...however, those all seem to be 'prepaid programs' rather than banks and I feel a bit wary with that.

Another plus side is that I think LMCU will reimburse up to $15 in atm fees per month (which will be sufficient for me), and also you can use the app to deposit money orders (I can't deposit MO with Fidelity...can you deposit MO with Ally?).

The fact that I'd still get reimbursed ATM fees, a much higher interest rate, and MO deposits via the app are enough to make me consider the switch, and looking for some thoughts about LMCU.

I'm also curious as to whether they will allow cash deposits via ATM.

We have ~$40k left on a ~$65k mortgage.  The interest rate is ~4%.   

In non-retirement accounts we have ~$70k (not doing much, only nominal interest in high yield checking).

I'm paying this down aggressively, $1200 so far this month with another $2000 going on it before the interest gets calculated.  Another $1000 in the next month at least to a total of $4200 over the next couple months.

Unfortunately I went from a credit score of 730ish to about 680 during this time of high credit card debt. This should rectify it's self in the next 6 months or so when I can get it all paid off.

In addition to this, I have $45,000 in student loans to pay off with a mix of subsidized and un-subsidized loans. It seems like there are some decent options for refinancing this debt lately but I feel like I should wait until my credit is at it's healthiest to make the refinanced interest rate as low as possible.

The other reason I think I should wait is that I most likely will have a higher monthly payment on the student loans after refinancing and that means less money to throw at the credit card debt (17% interest compared to 4.5%-6.8%).

worldpolitics,End Game in Ukraine - Russia Wins - by Alexander Mercouris,"We told you this would happen.  Normandy Four Talks seal Russia's victory. --  by Alexander Mercouris 

At the time of the negotiation of the Minsk Agreement in February we said that the international part of the Ukrainian crisis appeared to be past its peak.  

Our precise words were: “The conflict in Ukraine itself will grind on, probably until the government currently in power in Kiev falls, which will surely happen sooner or later.

However, as a crisis in international relations, following the talks in Moscow and Minsk, it appears its peak has passed.”

That this was so became clearer in May, when the Russians disclosed the Europeans were prepared to discuss changes to Ukraine’s association agreement with the EU, which had caused the original crisis.

What we said in the first months of the year, is now the general consensus. 

It is now widely recognised, since the last Normandy Four meeting in Paris, that the Ukrainian crisis is winding down.

Before discussing this in detail, it is necessary to correct a false account of recent events that is being spread by some parts of the Western media.

According to this account “Putin” has “tired of his Ukrainian adventure”, and is winding the conflict down, as he looks for ways to extricate himself from “the Ukrainian quagmire”. 

According to some over-heated commentary, Russia’s military intervention in Syria is part of a cunning plan by “Putin” to “divert attention” from Ukraine and end his “pariah status”.  This stands reality on its head.   The Russians have always sought a negotiated solution to the Ukrainian conflict.  

They pressed for this in discussions with the US in the spring of 2014, directly following the Maidan coup, obtaining apparent US agreement in the form of the 17th April 2014 Geneva Statement. They pressed for this in discussions with Angela Merkel that began with the first Normandy Four meeting in June 2014, which led to the setting up of the Contact Group and the Berlin Declaration of 3rd July 2014, which called for an unconditional ceasefire.

They dictated the terms of the Minsk Protocol of September 2014, which brought the first round of fighting to an end, and which set out a road map for a peace settlement. They also dictated the terms of the Minsk Agreement of February 2014, which everyone now pretends to be following.

It is the Ukrainians who - egged on by their Western backers - have repeatedly sought war.

Ignoring the Geneva Statement of April 2014, they first tried to crush resistance with what they called an “anti-terrorist operation”.  When that failed they doubled down, launching a full-scale military offensive on 30th June 2014, which ended in disaster. They then reneged on the terms of the Minsk Protocol, and launched another offensive in January 2015. When that too ended in disaster they agreed - under pressure from Merkel - the Agreement that was reached in Minsk in February 2015.

So far from the Europeans acting as a force for restraint throughout all this, they blatantly took sides, backing the Ukrainians to the hilt even as the Ukrainians repeatedly reneged on promises they had made. 

In July 2014, shortly after the Ukrainians began their offensive, the Europeans - using the MH17 tragedy as cover - imposed sectoral sanctions on Russia.  In September 2014, after the Minsk Protocol was agreed, they tightened the sanctions even more.  In June 2015, despite the Ukrainians reneging on the Minsk Agreement, they extended the sanctions until the end of the year

In light of this, to say that it is the Russians who are “calling off their aggression” in Ukraine to extricate themselves from a “quagmire”, is not merely false; it is absurd.

Patrick Armstrong, that most insightful of commentators of Russian affairs, predicted at the start of the Ukrainian crisis that (1) Ukraine as it existed in the summer of 2013 is gone forever; and (2) when the failure of their adventure in Ukraine became clear, Western governments would declare victory and withdraw.

He is proving right on both counts.

So what did happen in Paris a week ago?

The starting point is the agreement that was reached in Minsk in February. That agreement required direct negotiations between the two sides to amend the Ukrainian constitution so as to provide a broad measure of autonomy to the people of the Donbass.  In the interim, until the constitutional changes were agreed, the two sides were supposed to agree an interim law granting special status to the two territories of the two people’s republics.  An annex to the Minsk agreement set out the minimum requirements to be met by that law.

The Ukrainians reneged on this agreement.

They refused to negotiate directly with the leaders of the two people’s republics.  They did not agree with them a law granting the territories of the two people’s republics special status, or discuss with them the constitutional changes.

Instead they sought to enact unilaterally proposals that would have actually increased rather than reduced the Ukrainian Presidency's control of the regions.

In public comments Poroshenko has gone further still, saying he intends to remove all references to “special status” from the Ukrainian constitution, abolishing a legal status that in Minsk in February he agreed to grant to the territories of the two people's republics.

At the same time the Ukrainians continue to call the leaders of the people's republics “terrorists”, and have refused to enact an amnesty law, as they had also agreed to do.

Though the Minsk Agreement envisages the disarming of the various volunteer militias that have proliferated in Ukraine since the Maidan coup (save for a security force the two people’s republics would be allowed to keep), no attempt to do so has been made.

One small militia group, the so-called “Tornado” force, has been dispersed - apparently as a result of an intra oligarch factional quarrel. 

The others have simply been given official status by being formally incorporated in Ukraine’s security structures or - as in the case of Right Sector - have been left alone to rampage as before.

Instead of carrying out the provisions of the Minsk Agreement, as it was required to do, the Ukrainian government used the break in the fighting to rebuild its army through repeated conscription drives.  By the start of August it claimed to have 90,000 men under arms.

All the indications at the start of August pointed to an imminent Ukrainian offensive. 

Heavy weapons that were supposed to have been withdrawn were brought back to the front line.  Shelling of the Donbass resumed with a vengeance (it had never ceased completely).  Probing attacks were launched on militia positions. 

Poroshenko meanwhile made increasingly belligerent speeches - including one that spoke of war without end.

In the event the Ukrainian offensive never happened.

The reasons for this were two. 

Firstly, the militia - which has grown significantly in strength and organisation - had no difficulty repulsing the Ukrainian attacks.  

Secondly  - and for the first time in the conflict - Merkel acted decisively to prevent it. 

At a meeting with Poroshenko at the end of August, she told him to stick to the Minsk Agreement, and warned him off an offensive.

Given the extent to which Ukraine depends on European support, Poroshenko had no choice but to agree.

The result is the quietest period Donbass has known since the start of the conflict in April 2014.  Though sporadic clashes still happen, shelling has largely stopped, and for the first time it is possible to talk about a genuine ceasefire.

It is important to say that the reason Merkel acted in August to prevent the Ukrainian offensive taking place is not because she has suddenly become converted to the justice of the Donbass’s cause.

It is because Merkel knows that another Ukrainian offensive will result in another Ukrainian defeat.

That might put the whole existence of the Ukrainian state in jeopardy, and lead to demands on the part of its Western backers for greater escalation.  

With her sanctions policy visibly failing, and German public opinion strongly opposing calls for further escalation, this is a situation Merkel wants to avoid at all costs.

As for the Ukrainians, if their gamble was that the prospect of defeat would firm up Western support to the point of delivering them victory, then they miscalculated badly and have lost.

The proof of that has been what has happened since.

Both at the summit in August and at the Normandy Four meeting in Paris the Europeans have made clear that Kiev must stick to the Minsk Agreement and strictly adhere to its terms. 

Ukrainian suggestions that the Minsk Agreement be ditched and a new agreement reflecting their positions be substituted in its place have been firmly rebuffed.  

Instead the deadlines for carrying out the terms of the Minsk Agreement have been extended into 2016, with the Ukrainians being told that this time they must adhere to them, with a French drafted timetable for their implementation that would lead to elections in the people's republics in March 2016 in accordance with a law granting the people's republics special status, as originally envisaged in the Agreement agreed in February 2015 in Minsk.

Ominously for the Ukrainians, in comments made after the Paris meeting and undoubtedly agreed in advance with Merkel, Hollande repeatedly used the words “special status” - the status Poroshenko says he wants to abolish. 

Reports of the private discussions between Putin and Merkel in Paris say Merkel agreed that Crimea is and will remain Russian, and that the main topic was not Ukraine at all, but Syria.

The dynamic of the Paris negotiations is shown clearly in the photographs of the plenary meeting.  

They show Putin sitting directly across the table from Merkel, flanked by Lavrov on his right and Hollande on his left - almost as if Hollande was part of Putin’s negotiating team. 

Poroshenko sits opposite Hollande, to Merkel’s right, with German foreign minister Steinmeier sitting to Merkel’s left. 

It is as if Poroshenko has been relegated to a part in Merkel’s negotiating team, even though it is the fate of his country which is being discussed.

To those who say that I am reading too much into these seating arrangements, the short answer is that in diplomatic negotiations seating arrangements are extremely important and are always agreed (sometimes after lengthy discussions) in advance.


If it were intended to give Poroshenko equal status to the other three, a round or oval table would have been used, as has happened before and as was used in the less formal non-plenary sessions, or Poroshenko would have been positioned directly opposite Putin, which would be logical, since this is supposed to be a Russian Ukrainian conflict and it is the fate of Ukraine - the country Poroshenko leads - which is being discussed. 

In all the photographs Poroshenko looks unhappy and distracted - as he also did at the UN General Assembly session held shortly before in New York.  

Poroshenko’s sombre appearance led to some catty stories in the Russian press that he was stopped from boarding a plane to Moscow because he was blind drunk.  That is certainly untrue. 

Did the Russians make any concessions?

They did agree that the local elections the two people’s republics had called for the end of October and the beginning of November should be called off.

Those elections were called because of Ukraine’s failure to agree a law on special status as agreed in the Minsk Agreement.  That law was supposed to be followed by elections, the terms of which were to be set out in the law.

Since the Ukrainians never negotiated or agreed the terms of the law - as the Minsk Agreement required them to do - the leaders of the two people's republics said they would go ahead with elections by themselves

These elections were called by the people's republics in agreement with Moscow to put pressure on the Europeans.  

The Europeans were in effect told that if the Ukrainians did not abide by the terms of the Minsk Agreement and agree with the leaders of the people's republics a law for the special status of the territories of their republics, then the people's republics would go their own way, holding elections without reference to Kiev, and starting the process of secession from Ukraine and union with Russia.  

Stories that circulated of a referendum being planned in the people's republics on Crimean lines for secession from Ukraine and union with Russia drove the point home.

Since this is for the Europeans the nightmare scenario, which would not only reignite the international aspect of the crisis - which they are desperate to end - but which would also expose in the most humiliating way the total failure of their sanctions policy, they responded by piling on the pressure on Poroshenko to go back to what was agreed in Minsk.

The result is that the Ukrainians have not only been told to do what they promised to do in February in Minsk, but the failure to do it previously is now being blamed on them.

Agreeing to postpone the elections in the Donbass was therefore for the Russians no concession at all.  It was a diplomatic play that worked.

As the Europeans have moved to close down the international aspect of the Ukrainian crisis, they are also taking steps to mend their relations with Russia.

That this is so is made clear by the steps the Europeans have taken to settle the two issues that are key for Russia: sanctions and gas supplies.

As German exports - especially of engineering goods - have contracted, the German business community has increasingly signalled its wish to see the sanctions ended. 

The call has been taken up by no less a person than Germany’s Economics Minister and Vice Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, who is also the leader of the SDP, and who undoubtedly has ambitions to become Chancellor one day.

Support for sanctions elsewhere in Europe is melting away.  In France they are deeply unpopular with the powerful agricultural lobby, whilst the French government for its part found an elegant solution to the Mistral debacle by paying the Russians a refund and selling the ships with Russia’s agreement to Russia’s ally Egypt.

As to the gas conflict, recent developments have been more interesting still.

The threat Russia might increasingly redirect its gas supplies away from Europe caused dismay in Germany, whose industry has come to rely increasingly on Russian gas.

The result was negotiations leading to the announcement of the North Stream 2 pipeline, essentially replacing South Stream, and reducing Russia’s interest in Turk Stream, which is therefore being scaled down.

It goes without saying that North Stream 2 could only have been agreed with the approval of the German government.  It includes an asset swap whereby Gazprom has finally achieved its ambition to acquire significant ownership of pipeline assets downstream within the European pipeline network - something the Europeans have previously resisted.

Meanwhile, in order to secure their supplies through Ukraine this winter, the Europeans have also agreed to do something they have always resisted doing previously, which is agree to pay Russia for Ukraine’s gas.

The Europeans appeared to agree to this last winter, with talk of a comfort letter being given to the Ukrainians guaranteeing that the Europeans would pay for their gas imports from Russia.  

In the event the comfort letter never materialised, and the Ukrainians were left to pay for their gas and clear their arrears to Russia by themselves.  That almost exhausted their foreign currency reserves, provoking a crash of their currency, leading to capital controls, which are still in place.

This time the Europeans have provided the Russians with a formal protocol, agreeing to pay the Russians $500 million for gas they will supply to Ukraine, thereby removing any incentive to Ukraine to siphon off gas intended for Europe.

That almost certainly will not be enough, but it establishes an important principle, and means the Europeans and the Russians are now negotiating directly with each other over gas supplies, with the Ukrainians once again relegated to a secondary role.

Negotiations are also underway to settle the anti-trust case the European Commission has brought against Gazprom.

The Financial Times has sought to portray these moves to settle the various gas conflicts as concessions by Russia and Gazprom to save their position in the European gas market (as for example: “Gazprom seeks peace after long fight with Brussels”).

That once again stands reality on its head.  

Germany’s agreement to North Stream 2, which increases Europe’s dependence on Russian gas, is a victory for Russia not a defeat. 

It brings forward the day when Ukraine finally loses its position as a gas transit state, a fact of which the Ukrainians are fully aware, as shown by the way they have angrily denounced North Stream 2 as a “betrayal”. 

The proposal the Europeans pay the bill for Ukraine's gas has been made repeatedly by the Russians ever since the first Russian Ukrainian gas war in 2006.  It is the Europeans who have resisted it.

There is no evidence the Russians have made any substantive concessions in return. 

Importantly, the Financial Times has omitted mention of the single biggest concession the Europeans have made: their agreement to pay the Russians the bill for Ukraine’s gas.

As for the issue where the Financial Times claims Gazprom is making concessions - its supposed “dogmatic insistence” in linking gas prices to oil prices - the link is made by the market, not Gazprom, because of the weight of the oil price in determining the price of energy products like gas, and nothing the EU Commission or Gazprom pretend to agree with each other will change it.  The reality anyway is that it is unlikely Gazprom has actually made any significant concessions on this issue.

Here once again we see another example of Patrick Armstrong's prediction coming true: the West beats a retreat at the same time as its media declares victory.

It is not all plain sailing.  The Ukrainians have successfully wrecked the European and Russian attempt to renegotiate the association agreement.

They did this by slapping a huge number of sanctions on Russian companies, essentially closing Ukraine off from Russian companies, and ending the trade links between the two countries.

That the purpose of the Ukrainian sanctions was to kill the renegotiation of the association agreement was pointed out by Russian Economics Minister Ulyukaev, though it is a fact that seems otherwise to have gone unnoticed.

A cynic’s response is that since the Europeans no longer care about Ukraine, they are no longer concerned to help Ukraine’s economy by preserving its access to the Russian market, whilst the Russians realised some time ago that preserving their trade relationship with Ukraine is impossible so long as the present government remains in power.

Since both sides are now working to remove Ukraine as an issue of contention between them, with the Europeans abandoning their geopolitical play to attach Ukraine to the West, the association agreement has lost its relevance, with the Ukrainian people once more being left to pay the price as their country's economy loses its preferential position in the Russian market.

It is perhaps not a coincidence that as this has happened the credit ratings agencies, despite the recent debt restructuring agreement, have downgraded Ukraine to a state of technical default, effectively closing off its access to capital markets.

As steps are taken to bring Europe’s relations with Russia back on an even keel, statements calling for a rapprochement are coming from both sides.

The first was the call for the lifting of sanctions by German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel. 

This was followed by a call from former Soviet President Gorbachev - made almost certainly with the agreement of the Russian government - for a Russian German alliance.  The Russian authorities know that Gorbachev is still popular in Germany, and they sometimes use him to make such calls.

The clearest call of all has however come from an unexpected quarter, from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.  On 9th October 2015 he was reported as saying:

“We must make efforts towards a practical relationship with Russia. It is not sexy but that must be the case, we can’t go on like this….. Russia must be treated decently … We can’t let our relationship with Russia be dictated by Washington.”

Not only is this a call for a rapprochement with Russia.  It is the strongest and most public criticism of Washington’s anti-Russian policy made by a senior European official to date.  

In summary, the signs that the international aspect of the Ukrainian crisis is ending - which still looked tentative in the spring - are now unmistakable. 

It would now require a major effort by the hardliners in Washington to put all this into reverse, and doing so would risk a serious crisis in relations between Europe and the US. 

A further thaw in relations, and a probable lifting of sanctions at some point in the next few months, now looks a virtual certainty.

In return the Russians have conceded nothing, and they look set to achieve in Ukraine their objectives: autonomy for the people of the people of the Donbass together with the exclusion of Ukraine from NATO and the EU.

In saying this however it is important to reiterate a point we have made before.

The end of the international aspect of the Ukrainian crisis does not mean the end of the crisis in Ukraine.  

There things continue to go from bad to worse. 

The economic situation continues to worsen, with the IMF downgrading its forecasts for Ukraine, and predicting an even worse recession this year than it had forecast before.

It remains a virtual certainty that Ukraine will default in December on the $3 billion debt it owes Russia. 

There is no evidence - and no possibility - that the hardliners in the Maidan movement will ever reconcile themselves to the Minsk Agreement, or will agree to grant the territories of the two people's republics the sort of autonomy that the Minsk Agreement envisages.

The government’s popularity continues to plunge, and the stand-off with Right Sector shows its uncertain grip on the internal situation.

If the international aspect of the Ukrainian crisis is drawing to a close, the internal crisis has barely begun.

personalfinance,Parents Awful Debt Situation,"Hi everyone,

I recently found this subreddit and would love to hear from some of you guys.

My parents are in about as awful of a situation I could have imagined, and things only get worse it seems with time.

My parents are 59 and 56, have about $50,000 in credit card debt, halfway through on a 30-year mortgage in a house that's probably worth $200K (not really sure how much it's worth), they're both shopaholics and they have maybe $100K saved for retirement. I feel like it's nearly unheard of to be in as bad of a situation.

My father recently got a tumor in his bladder that was found to be cancerous and has spread a little. A few weeks prior, he is without a job and still without one as he goes into his BCG treatment.

My mom works as a part time nurse pulling in about $38K a year. I think she just finally decided she should start looking for full time. My mom's mom (my grandama) has been bed-ridden in a hospital for about 5 years now and my mom visits her once a week, an hour and a half away. This makes her '05 car have 190K miles on it but it still runs nicely as it's all highway miles (knock on wood). I feel terrible but the constant visiting has been helping bury herself.

I don't know what they can do. I want to help because I've got about $7000, but I don't want to waste my money on them when I'm in college and not with much of my own. Due to them usually combining for over $100K in income annually, I have to pay $28K a year at the private college I'm at, all of it under student loans.

I have talked to both of my older brothers about their situation time and time again, but my parents are just horrific with money decisions and don't budge on anything and rarely believe us when we try to tell them how something is. They've never met with a financial advisor I believe.

My brothers and I have been tossing around bankruptcy for a little while now. I feel ashamed to be a part of something, but they have been in credit card debt probably since their 20s and they have only added to it (didn't think that was even possible).

We all drive older cards, don't have any other big assets besides those and the house. I drive one of our best and most reliable cars that's an '03 Tahoe with 130K miles on it.

I'm afraid that if they file for bankruptcy that we'll lose the house and all the cars and god knows what will happen to my interest rates on my student loans.

I've been using a CC since 18 to establish history and get about 8.1% of a student loan when applying by myself. My dad as a cosigner knocked it down to 7.625% this year.

Any insight, advice, literally anything is appreciated. I know it's a shitty situation and I hate being surrounded by it because I'm very good with budgeting and knowing how to save money, good with my hands to save money on repairs, etc.

Thanks in advance. God bless.",finance,1444704921

personalfinance,Am I paying too much into my student loans?,"I am a 22 year old recent graduate currently working/living in San Francisco with a $55,000 annual income (not much for this city). 

I have a nagging feeling that my monthly student loan contributions are coming too greatly at the expense of monthly living expenses and benefits. The following is a breakdown of my situation and I was hoping you all could provide some insight on what may be the best course of action.

Post-tax, maxed to employer-match at 5% for a 401k, I earn $3,126.81 a month. $1000 goes immediately to rent, $160.74 goes to my benefits (HSA, dental, vision, and disability) and I've allocated $1000 to my student loans every month. 

My unsubsidized student loans that require attention now are as follows:

Principal | Accrued Interest | Total Balance | Interest Rate
---------|----------------|-------------|-------------
$2,000 | $538.66 | $2,538.66 | 6.8%
$6,500 | $1,306.44 | $7,806.44 | 6.8%
$3,541 | $266.38 | 3807.38 | 3.86%
$2,296 | $101.86 | $2,397.86 | 4.66%

After loans, benefits, 401k, and taxes, I am left with $1,126.81 every month for all other living expenses (groceries, entertainment, socializing, transportation, etc.).

From looking at my (albeit short) expense list, I saw that I'm spending roughly $100 monthly on public transit, $300 on eating out, $50 on utilities, $200 on household expenses + groceries, $100 on entertainment, $100 on Ubers, and $50 miscellaneous spending.

That's roughly $800 gone and a little over $300 in saving every month. I suspect this may be a riskily low amount. While I am trying to make some lifestyle changes to address this (such as reducing the amount I eat out), I also feel that my allocation to student loans may be too high and leaving me in a risky personal situation.

For instance, I contribute only $90 a month to my HSA - nowhere near the max. While I am very healthy (I am a frequent half-marathon runner and go to the gym regularly) and have never needed a doctor, I am beginning to question how financially savvy this decision may be. I am also starting to think I should go beyond my employer-match for my 401k but am concerned this will leave me too exposed savings-wise.

The only real solution I see is reducing my student loan allocation. Is my current situation of forgoing savings (both through my 401k, HSA, and simply monthly cash reserves in the bank) to pay off loans with some immediacy fiscally sound at all?

Or are my suspicions that I am trading too much of my future financial security for debt alleviation now more accurate? Basically, given the circumstances of my income and expenses, what is the most financially responsible/appropriate course of action I should be taking (should I be raising my 401k and HSA contributions)? 

Thank you, I know this is long and that much of this is addressed in past posts found via the search bar. But I figured, why not use past data *and* get a more personalized answer from those who would want to provide some guidance? Thanks again.",finance,1444709505

    Loan Amount: $69,000.00 USD 
    Current rate: Fixed @ 6.5%
    SoFi options
    fixed:    
    20 yr @ 5.375 ~= $469.78 monthly
    15 yr @ 5.125 ~= $550.15 monthly
    variable:
    20 yr @ 3.325 ~= $394.00 monthly 
    15 yr @ 3.075 ~= 478.99 monthly ( which is what I currently pay )
    10 yr @ 2.700 ~= 656.76 monthly
    7   yr @ 2.200 ~= 887.05 monthly
    5   yr @ 1.910 ~= 1,206.70 monthly 
    The maximum for 5-10 year variable is: 8.95%, maximum for 15/20 is 9.95%


Current mortgage

    Mortgage, PMI, escrow, and insurance monthly : $2,222.00 
    Hoping to get out of PMI / possibly refinance as the house should be worth $330,000 now. ( Added construction, upgrades etc )

Vehicle

    Utilities: ~$784
    Food: ~$990
    Blow/Personal: ~$1,620
    Entertainment: ~$400
    Student Loans: $480

I do want to pay off the student loans because I don't like having debts. My financial advisor mentions not paying it off in case I die, to not pass that on to my wife. It's more of an emotional thing for me, wanting to not have debts. 


My company matches 401k ( currently at minimum value to get the max match ), gives me 15% reduction in employee stock purchasing up to $10k every 6 months. I also have the option to contribute post tax to Roth 401k. Another option I have is a pension builder.


So my question is which should I refinance to? 
My current thoughts have been:

* 20 year fixed rate and have a lower monthly payment and focus on other things and just ride out the 20 years. Focus on the other retirement options.
* 15/20 year variable rate, build up savings and have it ready in case the rate goes up, since rate of inflation is currently between 1-2%
* 5 year variable and just pay it off as fast as possible





To add another thing into the mix. My wife and I are expecting. So in May we will have additional expenses. I am also 32 years old, I have been in my field for about 15 years.

If I left out anything please let me know.

* Trying to beat the market often proves to be detrimental. Index Funds are the surest way to achieving wealth - you just have to be patient and continue putting money into them throughout your life

* Having a well diversified portfolio that is re-balanced on a predetermined schedule will keep your original investment strategy in tact and functioning well.

* Investments typically work best over the long run. Trying to make money off of most forms of investment over the short term (think 5-7 years) is more similar to gambling than anything else. If you need the money soon, keep it safe. Knowing it'll be there for you is more important than risking to lose some of it just in the hopes of making some gains.

With that being said, I'd like to share my personal plan with you. The purpose of my investment plan is two-fold: 1) To ensure that my retirement savings will enable me to retire at 65 and 2) To ensure that my short term savings (&lt;5 years) stay safe and earn a modest return.

**Goal 1: Retirement Savings**

I plan to always put 10% of my income towards this.

My route to securing wealth in the long run will be to buy-and-hold, invest over the long-term, and exclusively use well diversified index funds because of their proven success. A lot of research has shown that if I start saving at 25 (I'm 26), I only need to put aside 10% of my annual salary to retire at 65. And this is exactly what I plan on doing starting next month. [Here is a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/xUBBUGv.jpg) showing the breakdown of it all. In the first two columns, I've stated how much of my portfolio I'll always want to have go towards certain asset classes. The Value, Actual, Target, and Difference columns are all for re-balancing, which I plan to do on a biannual basis. The rest of the columns to the right list which index funds I'm *actually* using during that point in my life as well as which indexes they track and their equivalent tickers (I currently work for the federal government and get access to their Thrift Savings Plan [TSP] so I'll be using index funds from this program. Because TSP funds are trust funds that are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and not by the SEC, they do not have ticker symbols.)

Depending on how old I am, my ability to take risk will change. I've graphed this change in risk over my life as a function of Stock Allocation : Bond Allocation. [Check it out here.](http://i.imgur.com/D7mbzkY.jpg)

**Goal 2: Short Term Savings**

I'm currently able to put 30% of my income towards this.

My route to securing modest gains for short term savings will be to always use low-risk savings accounts because the value of an investment in the short term is never a sure thing. I plan on using a Money Market account to do this.

personalfinance,"Looking for advice: leaving for Army Basic training in December, I would like to invest in a reliable car when I finish up training.","Hey Personal Finance! Like I said in the title, I leave for Army Basic Training in December. I will finish up all my training by mid-April. I am 21, male, attending college. Currently no rent (will change when I return from training), and about $3500 in student loan debt. I have had one used car loan, paid it off early. I currently drive a 93 Geo Tracker, 188k miles. Many electrical problems, hard top leaks in the lightest of rain, and is a unreliable car at best. Should I use some of the money I make while in training to put down a sizable payment on a newer, reliable, used car, or just hold off and save for a while? 
P.S. I am thinking about going with a ~2011 vw Golf TDI, around $15k. Thanks!

Edit: Should've cleared up some other back story stuff. I am in the National Guard and Army ROTC through college. When I return from training I will have ~3 years left of school until - hopefully - I commission into active duty. There is a potential of deployment until I contract with ROTC, but I don't think the chances are high.
As far as other info: My income will primarily be salary through the National Guard, along with tuition assistance (state and federal), basic housing allowance, and possibly G.I. Bill. I am hoping to not have to get another part time job so that I can focus on making the best grades I can. That being said, my main expenses will be gas, food, and rent. Typical college student stuff.

personalfinance,Co-worker recently won 5k on a scratch off. He was already doing okay financially. Offered to lend me money to pay off my credit debt.,"I've known this guy about 3 years, he wants to lend me 1500 to pay off my credit card debt, I'd be paying him back 100 a week on payday.  I can afford this 100 a week (my min CC payment is 266... i haven't made a payment since april cause i'm stupid).  He was happy to call it even when the 1500 was repaid, I offered to make a 16th payment so he makes 100 dollars for me tying up his funds for 4 months.  

i have a stoney brain.  i am bad with money.  this offer came very suddenly and sounds like a favourable situation when compared to making minimal CC payments i can't really afford+ interest.  just wanted to run it by some less stoney minds.  so my question is this:  

my interest rate is some 21%, debt is 1450, buy paying my buddy a flat rate of 100 dollars for the loan am i saving money in the long run (the lower payments that i will make to co-worker are much more manageable as well)?  The only risk here is my friendship with my co-worker? am i possibly hurting myself by zeroing my CC balance over night rather than making scheduled payments?  I do have another, low balance CC through my bank that i use to buy groceries, of which i pay the total due monthly.

I recently switched employers, and my current company is deducting their cost of my benefits (roughly $198 medical and $50 dental, I think) from those SCA H&amp;W wages, as well as roughly $19 for their core costs that I don't pay a premium on (life insurance, etc.). This is in addition to my own payments of roughly $50 for both medical and dental. My prior employer did not do this, they just gave me the ~$320 every paycheck and my premiums were a bit higher ($150 total for medical/dental), which is still obviously more net money overall.

I'm mostly curious if anyone knows how this works out. Are both situations at the discretion of the employer? Anyone know which is the more common scenario?

personalfinance,(UK) Student taking a loan from bank: advice please,"Hi,

I posted here a few months back detailing money worries and I have decided to approach my bank for a loan. They have a good history of lending to students and I think have offered me a pretty good deal (see below).

This money will have two purposes: a) to fund a trip to Australia for a clinical placement I have been offered there (I'm a medical student). I'm seriously considering moving to Australia after I graduate so I see this trip partly as future planning (if I hate it, I've saved money and a year out of work 3 years from now) and not a ""holiday"" as I've been accused of in the past; and b) to make up for the shortfall in the money provided by my student loans versus my cost of living (in addition to cutting rent and discretionary spending).

My bank has offered me up to £15,000 at an interest rate of the base rate plus 2% - currently this works out at 2.5% interest rate. The deal is that I don't have to start any repayments until two years after I take out the loan, but after that the loan must be payed off in the following three years. This means I will have been working for a couple of months post-graduation before any repayments start.

These are the figures I have worked out. It has been a long time since I did maths so I was hoping someone could check them for me! To my mind, if I took out a £15k loan, the total to be repaid based on 2.5% interest for 5 years would be £15,961.44. Paid over three years this is roughly £433 a month. Have I got those figures right for calculating interest etc?

A £10k loan works out to £295 a month using the same calculations. Basically whether I have worked this out right is my main question!

In my first year I can expect to earn a base salary of £22,636 before tax. With overtime etc I can expect to make 30-40% more for overtime (around £30,105 before tax in that year for the sake of argument) however in reality this may be more (I'd have to be quite unlucky to make less). In my second year I start on roughly £28k with 30-40% added for overtime, and hopefully in my third year £30k with 30-40% added for overtime.

Taking into account my first year working (and first year paying back the loan), based on £30k a year I would have a take-home of £1700 a month after tax and student loan deductions. My main question is, is a £433/month repayment going to be a struggle on that salary? To my mind it is not, that plus a generous £500 for rent and bills means I'd have around £750 to ""play"" with each month, although that's assuming I don't incur other bills like a car payment or something.

I am also thinking that if I did take out the full £15k as a safety net and had a lot left over in two years, I could repay a lump sum to reduce my monthly payments (I think the penalty is a month's interest).

Should I take out the loan in its full amount? Or a smaller amount - around £10k? Basically I need the money, I'm just wondering whether I should borrow big for the safety net or limit it so that my future situation is better. Most importantly, are my figures above correct? Thank you for taking the time to read!

TL;DR: is a loan of £10-15k based on 2.5% interest over 5 years, deferred for 2 years and paid back over the next 3, on a starting salary of roughly £30k pre tax a good idea or one to avoid?",finance,1444751229
personalfinance,"Advice for a guy, me, who's finally making money but doesn't have good ""money sense.""","I want to start off by admitting that I have very little financial sense. My dead beat parents didn't have much to offer in the way of good financial advice. I've read a lot of the FAQ's, as well as a few audio books and podcasts, and have a case of paralysis by over analysis.

Anyways, I earned both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in my twenties but never earned more than $28,000 in a year. Fortunately, I've fallen into a secure blue collar career and it's turned my life around. My gross income's jumped significantly these past few years; I'm on pace to clear six-figures this year. 

Those first 2 years of making ""real"" money, I wasted by buying a whole bunch of ""stuff"" I felt like I deserved since I had struggled for so long. These past 2 years have been productive though. I paid off all of my ""bad"" debt, boost my credit score by more than 200 points, and bought a home last year here in Denver. I already have about $80k in equity since the market here is insane right now. 

Other pertinent info.: I'm in my early thirties, no children (I don't want children), I live with my girlfriend who's gainfully employed and contributes $700 each month, $64,000 in student loan debt (consolidated at an interest rate of ~4%), leasing a pickup truck, financing a motorcycle, ~$40,000 in available credit, no credit card debt, 3 months living expenses in savings and slowly building to 6 months.

The problem is I have nothing saved towards retirement. No 401k (company doesn't match), no investments, nothing. Part of me wants to begin purchasing income properties, either to flip or rent, but the other part wants to throw that money into an investment firm like wealth front or vanguard. I do find the idea of income properties much more exciting. Any suggestions as to the best path to take to achieve lasting financial security would be appreciated.",finance,1444754487
personalfinance,Health Insurance problems and stupid predatory car loan.,"I am writing this on behalf of my girlfriend. (She doesn't go on reddit and is not very web savvy.)

My Girlfriend is a waitress/bartender in New Jersey.  She makes decent money when the restaurant is active, but life threw her a couple of bad breaks and now she is barely scraping by.  There are two major issues that I see her dealing with.  They are:

1) She bought a used car from a dealership at the beginning of the summer.  She didn't know exactly what she was getting into and she signed up for a loan with an insane APR (Almost 25%).  At the current rate, it will take her a year to pay off and cost $1000 more than what the loan originally was.  There are no penalties for paying off the loan early. So that's a plus. 

Conceivably if she pays the loan off entirely, right now, She can save almost $1000 in the next year.  I suggested she pay with a credit card (with a lower interest rate), but the company that gave her the loan only accepts checks and money orders.  We don't really know anyone that we could borrow the money from.

Any advice on how to pay off a large car loan early or transfer the debt somehow so that the interest rate is not so high?

2)  She has been trying to get health insurance for 2 years now with the obamacare website and NJ Medicaid.  They keep losing her information and she keeps getting a runaround.  It typically goes like this:  They ask her to send an additional form or additional information and wait 3 to 4 weeks.  After 3 to 4 weeks, she calls and they say they never received the additional information and to mail it again.  Repeat.  Eventually, she gets frustrated and gives up for a few weeks until she begins to worry about not having health insurance and starts the routine over.  By this time the enrollment period is over and she has to wait several months.

Regarding health insurance.  Is there any kind of website or support group or service that will help you when you keep getting lost in the system?  At this point, she may be willing to pay extra just for the piece of mind of having health insurance, but she can't even seem to get anyone to reply back and give her the option of paying more.  

Has anyone had similar issues dealing with medicaid or the obamacare website?

Does she really have to wait for the enrollment period each year?  Or can she apply for medicaid year round?

personalfinance,"Notice from IRS - $1,000 in additional taxes due from 2013","My girlfriend received notice in the mail yesterday regarding her 2013 return--apparently the IRS has determined that she owes an additional $1k in taxes due to a disbursement she took from her mutual fund that year (she was unemployed and relocated to live with me, and needed money while she hunted for work as I could not support us both). We are both inexperienced with this sort of thing--we are in our early thirties and have not historically made enough money nor had complex enough finances to justify hiring a tax professional--typically, every year we file a simple 1040, get a modest return, and that's that.

When she was filing her 2013 taxes last year, she was using TurboTax or some other online tax service that walked her through the forms she'd need to fill out. At the time, she made sure she had her documentation from her mutual fund, and thought she had accounted for everything (at least as far as TurboTax guided her).

The news of this added tax burden comes at a very inopportune time--her career is very reliant on seasonal demands, and within the next couple of weeks she'll be facing either reduced hours or a temporary layoff. Ironically, she had been seriously considering taking a disbursement from her mutual fund in the near future to help cope with this period of underemployment/unemployment.

At this point, we're trying to figure out how to best come at this, and this is where we hope that your collective expertise can help guide us. Based on some preliminary research, it sounds like we have some options available to us, but it's unclear to me which of these is worth pursuing, and which might be a waste of time, money, or both.

* **She could speak with a tax professional**, which surely has some associated cost and may not give us any new information if the IRS's numbers are correct
* **She could [apply for a payment agreement](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Online-Payment-Agreement-Application)**, which would at least make the burden more bearable while she's not making as much money
* **She could attempt to [temporarily delay collection](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Temporarily-Delay-the-Collection-Process)**, though I'm not sure how likely she would be to get approved for that
* **She could attempt to [make an offer in compromise](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Offer-in-Compromise-1)**, which I'm even less sure about
* **She could borrow the needed amount from me** to make the payment in full, right away, and gradually pay me off as possible

As you see it, are there any significant options I'm overlooking? Would you advise for or against any of those options given our particular circumstances? I'm happy to answer any questions you might have to clarify the situation; I tried to keep this post lean and mean and not overload it with mundane or irrelevant details.

personalfinance,I am really starting to hate my credit union - alternatives?,"For a few reasons ...

First, their bill paying software had a glitch where it cancelled all pending payments and didn't notify customers.  Well, they DID put a little bitty banner text about ""currently experiencing problems with bill pay"" on their webpage but that only works if you go to their webpage.  Not so useful if you paid your bills and didn't think to verify that the payments went through a few days later.  They'll email you if you add a biller (for safety) but not if they cancel the 5 bills you had as pending payment.

Next - their rules around how you have to endorse your checks to use mobile deposit are extremely precise.  Don't write ""online deposit"", have to write ""mobile deposit"". Don't add the word ""only"" at the end.  Sign your name ABOVE the correct phrase.  Any violation means your deposit is rejected.

Lastly - their bill pay continues to suck.  It prepopulates the day to pay the bill, but half the time it puts in an option it really can't do.  For instance, you log on the 10th to pay a bill and it automatically puts the 12th in there.  You click accept, it goes to the next screen for you to confirm it (you click confirm) and it bounces you back to the entry screen saying, ""please select a valid date in blue"". Of course, the 12th IS blue but it won't go thru unless you pick something later on.

personalfinance,Student Loan Default: Consolidate or Rehabilitate? (xpost from /r/StudentLoans),"I decided I wanted to go back to school to finish my degree this year, but while applying for financial aid, I discovered that my previous federal student loans totaling about $9k had gone into default (payment notifications were going to my parents address, I live out of state, etc).

This has put me in a bit of a bind, as I can't pay for my current schooling without federal aid, which they won't give me until I am out of default, which gives me two options: sign up for loan rehabilitation (which I did) and get out of default in 9 months (while accruing about 12k more school debt in the coming year that would usually be subsidized with Pell grants and student loans), OR consolidate my debt and get out of default in a week, which will make me eligible for federal student aid immediately. 

It seemed like the answer was obvious to me until the Dept of Education officer I spoke with informed me that if I went through the rehabilitation program, they would delete my default with the credit bureaus after 9 months of steady payments, whereas paying my debt via consolidation would only result in a ""Paid in Full"" that would stick around on my credit report. Some quick googling and a review of this sub informed me that federal loans don't go for ""pay for delete"", so with that out of the picture, herein lies the real question: how much difference will a ""Paid in Full"" really make over a deleted default? My credit's already trashed from the default and a couple of other unrelated collections that I'm working out (I'm young, dumb, and learned a lot of financial lessons the hard way), and I've been told that the negative marks from all of the initial missed payments on my loan will still be on my credit report, regardless of whether I rehabilitate or pay in full. For my situation, it still seems like the best option would be to take the consolidation so I can continue my schooling without accruing more debt, but I wanted a second opinion before I make the jump. Are these my only options? Is there any chance that a goodwill letter after the fact may do something about the negative marks?

personalfinance,300k in student loan debt. Down payment on a house vs pay off loans.,"I know my situation is not the most typical but still seeking advice.  I'm a 30 year-old anesthesiologist and finished my residency not too long ago. 

Summary of my current situation...I have $300k in student loan debt at around 6.8%.  I don't have much in savings, just paid off all my credit card debt. I live in California. I am single with no children.  I currently live with my parents because my job is only 15 minutes away from their house and didn't make sense to me to have my own place at this time especially since I just moved back to California.  I may look to rent some time next year once I'm more settled and established but living with my parents saves me at least $1000 a month....

I am an independent contractor with a 1099 so I have to pay my own retirement, malpractice, and health insurance.  I don't get any paid vacation or paid sick leave.  I make between 17-20k/month after federal and state income taxes. This is what I am estimating...I actually haven't received my first full paycheck yet because there's a 2 month lag for billing.  My monthly student loan payments around 3.6-3.7k.  I pay it off in 9 years if I do that. After living expenses, disability insurance, malpractice insurance, health insurance, tax-protected retirement savings, etc.  I figure I have around 7-8k a month to throw at my student loans or savings. 

My question is if I should throw everything at that student loan or should I start saving for a down payment or split and do both at the same time.  I do live in California so cost of housing is expensive.  I was planning to save at least $120k for a down payment on a house or condo.  I'm not in a real rush to own a home yet especially since I am single with no children but advice from family is to do minimum payments on the student loans and buy a home ASAP but not sure if that's the best financial decision.

personalfinance,What type of mortgage should I get?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I'm starting the process of buying a duplex in the Bay Area, CA and I am trying to learn about the different options for loans. My plan is to live in one unit and rent out the other. I've previously owned a home in Seattle, WA, but I am currently renting here in California (Just moved here about 12 months ago). I am meeting with a loan officer in a few days to get pre-approved and I'd like to walk into that meeting educated about the different products I will likely be offered.

My basic question is around whether I should go with a fixed rate loan or an ARM. 

Here are the basic stats:

* Annual salary: $155k + bonus (around 15%). That will probably grow at 5% per year, conservatively.
* I have just shy of $500k available for a down payment. I'd prefer to use close to $400k of that at the most. 
* Credit score: ~805
* No debts
* Not married, but will likely live with my girlfriend. No plans for kids any time in the next 5 years at least (if ever)

By my rough calculations I can probably reasonably afford to pay around $900k-$1M for this property on the upper end. I am targeting to spend closer to $700-800k - but we'll see what the market gives me. The plan is to live in this property for around 7ish years, and in the meantime save up for another down payment. Once the time is right/I have enough money, I would buy a single family home that would probably be a longer term/permanent home and turn this duplex into purely an income property. 

My dad's advice is to go with ARM. I'm thinking that I could go with a 5/1 or 7/1 loan and use the extra money to save towards my next down payment. Even when I get to the point of the interest rate going up the rents in the Bay Area will be so inflated that I will have no problem covering the extra cost. Obviously the upside to a fixed rate loan is that as the rent increases, so will my cash flow. I feel like that at some point in the future I could re-finance into a fixed rate loan if it would be advantageous. 

What does everyone here think? Am I over-simplyifying things? Anything I am not taking into consideration? Would love any insight/feedback about my plan!",finance,1444804235

personalfinance,"[NL] Recent graduate, ful time job, living at home, looking for planning advice","Hello, r/personalfinance,

After a few weeks of intensive reading I want to make my first post. I'll introduce myself first:
I'm Bas, a 22 year old Business IT Management graduate and I recently (June this year) started my first full time job as a business intelligence consultant at an SMB IT consultancy company (around 50 employees). 
Currently I live at home with my parents. Living for free is very nice, especially with a full time salary, but I would like to own an appartment of my own.
I have about 7000 euro's in student loans (at a very low interest rate though, I believe it is 0.18% at the moment) and I own a credit card which I pay off in full every month. I have no other depts than the student loan.

My car is a paid for used diesel (5 years old) which I can keep on driving for another 5 years or so. I don't have a company car since in the Netherlands we pay around 175 euro's in taxes every month for driving a small company car. By driving my own car I don't have to pay these taxes plus I get travel compensation of 0,19 euro per km tax free and 100 euro fixed compensation (after tax) per month. 
I own about 10.000 euro's in cash in my checking and savings accounts. I do not invest (I did in the past, but since I want to move out in about 1 year it's saver not to invest I guess).

My current goal is to save as much as possible to be able to buy an appartment. Renting appartments where I live generally sets you back 800-1000 euro's a month (50-60 square meters) plus utilities, whilst buying a comparable one will be like 125.000 euro's at ~2.5% interest. 

I currently use a system with one checking account and three saving accounts:

1) Rainy day fund, which holds 2100 euro's at the moment and I save 100 euro every month to it

2) Car fund from which I pay all my car expenses and save for things like maintenance and depreciation - every month I save my travel compensation plus 175 euro's (which would be the amount of tax I'd pay when driving a company car). Each pay day this savings account gets a load of money from which I pay all my car expenses, and at the end of the month its balance should be bigger than last month to accomodate for maintenance and depreciation.

3) Main savings account, which I use to save for my first house. It holds some 6500 euro's at the moment and I aim to put 1K in it every month.

I keep my checking account topped to 800 euro's every pay day and allocate the rest to my saving accounts. That effectively means I have 800 euro's each month to live off. For example, I spend about 500 euro's that month, it leaves 300 in my checkings account, and I get paid 2K that month, I will allocate 1500 euro's to my savings (300+2000-800).

My current after tax pay is 1850 euro's a month plus car compensation. My car compensation (100 euro after tax plus 0,19 euro per km tax free) and 175 euro as mentioned above will go to the car account which leaves me with a net pay of 1675 a month. In my line of work I expeect to get some raises every year (starting December this year). 

I really want to live on my own but I understand I need to build at least some wealth first. My current net worth is about 10k (cash + car minus student loans) so I should save some more before buying or renting something. The problem with renting is that here in the Netherlands your are required by most landlords to to earn 50 times the rent a year in gross salary. For a simple 800 euro appartment that means earning at least 40k a year which will not be the case for the next few years. Buying is easier in respect to income. 

Have you guys any tips for me? In which direction am I heading, what am I doing good and what are mistakes I'm making? 

Kind regards,

personalfinance,Viability of starting a small business as a primary source of income.,"Something my husband brought up to me as a possibility, but I want to check the validity of it as a possibility before I even look into hard costs. 

Our current household income is about ~~$24k~~ $26k a year,  although with overtime and such it can fluctuate as high as $28k. Between the two of us we have about $110k in student loan debt (Federal)  and my mother took out about $80k in personal loans to pay for my college that she expects me to eventually pay back (not sure if that even falls under the traditional idea of debt,  so I'm unsure how to catagorize it) 

Other than that we have no other debt,  I'm in hard control of our finances,  and I expect to have about $4k in savings by next summer.  It's not a lot but it is something. 

I am extremely dissatisfied with my treatment and pay at my current job,  and my husband brought up the idea of getting a loan and starting a business.  We both have experience working as freelance artists, and have helped his mother with her online business, so the idea is not completely foreign to us.  We also have a friend who has been through the process,  but had to close his very successful shop because of a frivolous lawsuit that put his business on hold,  making him lose his clients. 

Anyways,  the process sounds appealing,  but the idea of banking my income on opening a store and taking out what I imagine will be at least $50k if not more  in debt is scary. We already owe quite a bit of money through our student loans and do not have much in easy of savings right now. 

Is this a viable option? It sounds like something is be happy doing,  but I'm worried that it will financially ruin us.

2. Do we take the money we have and buy a smaller/older home that we can sell in a few years before we move into another bigger house?

personalfinance,"PSA: Severance pay often isn't ""voluntary""","So one of the most common ""facts"" I see here involves the idea that severance pay after a layoff is **always** optional or voluntary and that an employee isn't legally entitled to it. Recently this misinformation was mentioned again in a post regarding the Twitter layoff.

Here are the actual facts:

* Federal WARN act requires 60 days notice of a mass layoff if the employer has more than 100 employees. Government employees usually aren't covered.
* A mass layoff is a loss of 500 or more employees over a 30 day period at or more than 33% of a company's workforce for 50-499 employees at a single site. Job losses within any 90-day period will count together toward WARN threshold levels.
* Employer must given written notice to the chief elected officer of the exclusive representative(s) or bargaining agency(s) of affected employees and to unrepresented individual workers who may reasonably be expected to experience an employment loss.
* An employer who violates the WARN provisions by ordering a mass layoff without providing appropriate notice is liable to each aggrieved employee for an amount including back pay and benefits for the period of violation, up to 60 days.

There are some caveats and exceptions I didn't mention, but the basis of most severance benefits is that 60 days notice (especially in the tech industry) is rarely given. You're usually walked out or just given 2 weeks notice - they don't tell you 60 days in advance that you're being laid off. Thus they have to offer pay in lieu of notice.

Many states have more strict WARN act requirements. In the Twitter case, more than 50 employees are being laid off within a 30 day period and 60 days notice was not provided before the layoff occurred. So severance will be offered.",finance,1444840958

investing,Short-term corporate bonds (2% ROI) as a great alternative to a savings account (1% ROI),"I needed a place to park a lump sum of cash until 2016 when they will be paid toward federal taxes, and didn't want to keep it sitting in a checking account earning zero. Originally, I had planned to use something like an [Ally.com](http://www.ally.com) savings account, earning risk-free 1% return.

But in July I made the switch over to Vanguard short term corporate bonds ([VSCSX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1945&amp;FundIntExt=INT); minimum $10K), and really haven't looked back.

Screenshot: [http://i.imgur.com/YTy3b4A.png](http://i.imgur.com/YTy3b4A.png)

As highlighted in the bottom left, this account has consistently delivered 2% in interest (1.98% to be exact) each month since I picked it up in the summer.

Yes, I no longer have FDIC insurance on my funds, and yes, there is interest rate and default risk. But I feel it's worth it considering it doubled my ROI. VSCSX seems just a few clicks up the risk/reward continuum (correct?), a full 1% extra for what I feel to be a negligible increase in risk.

I still have cash earning 1% risk-free over at Ally.com, and suggest this great first option for most people. However, if you feel you could increase the risk-profile for a portion of your short term savings, and can meet the minimum $10K requirement, I highly suggest a short term corporate bond fund like VSCSX (or its ETF alternative $VCSH).

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this question but I wasn't sure where else to post. I currently am a full time hardware engineer but I also casually run a side wedding photography business and make money from shooting weddings. Currently this year I've made approximately $7,000 (from deposits for next year weddings and one or two weddings I shot this year) and I expect to make about $10,000 total from additional deposits for weddings next year. This seems like a fair amount that I would need to pay taxes for but I have no idea where to start with it. To clarify, my photography business isn't registered and isn't ""officially"" a business and at the moment I'd like to keep it that way since it can be pretty tiring could change year to year. It's really a website and Facebook page that I have where I occasionally take clients and shoot for them. What would be the best way for me to pay these taxes and not be flagged by the IRS while avoiding the need to register as a business? Or do I need to register as a business at this point?

An additional question I had was that I planned on using this money I earned from photography to pay off my current student loans (~18k left). If I paid off let's say $7000 of my student loans (due to a 5% interest rate), would that help me avoid the need to pay taxes since the money would be going directly to loans or am I being completely unrealistic about that?

personalfinance,What happens if I default on my student loans and rely on my spouse's income to live?,"I am newly remarried, in my early 30s. I have student loan debt from a professional degree incurred during a previous marriage. Because much of it was for living expenses while married, my ex is responsible for some of it under our settlement.

My debt exceeds $120,000 (including ex's portion), for a degree that I am no longer interested in using. ~~Long story short, I started too young to know who I was and what I wanted, had some bad experiences on the job, became unemployed due to the economic downturn hitting my sector particularly hard, went through a difficult time and just checked out on the job front while going through the divorce and wrecked my ability for high earnings with large resume gaps. All I can get right now is temp work, and it's well known in my field that temp work is a dead end career-wise.~~

Current spouse and I are planning on starting our family this year. When that happens, I will be at home with the kids for the foreseeable future. I can earn some money freelancing while I'm at home. Spouse makes about $70k per year and is starting a side business (which I will help with but not be officially employed by) with the potential for residuals of $30k and growing in the coming years. We want to know what will happen if I stop paying my student loans. 

Obviously, they can come after my bank accounts (currently at zero because of a tax levy, again due to the divorce). But they can't come after spouse's accounts, right? And if we file our taxes separately, they can't come after his returns either, can they? My credit will be ruined (not that it was great to begin with), but spouse thinks we may be able to save enough cash for a sizable down payment so it wouldn't wreck our chances at a house, and everything else would just be in spouse's name. What happens when a spouse with pre-marriage student loans decides to drop out of the workforce and just not pay?

Edit: These are federal student loans.

Edit 2: Just to clarify, I understand that my not wanting the job for which I was educated doesn't excuse me from the moral obligation of paying! But if we could get 5-7 years of relief to get our lives up and running, the thought is that perhaps we could save up enough of a lump sum to settle the loans off after that.",finance,1444853394
personalfinance,Still in graduate school and undergraduate loans went into repayment. What is the best way to deal with this?,"I apologize if this is a long post.

I have two private loans from Salliemae that I had to take out as an undergraduate to finish college (2010). However, I started graduate school right after college and the loans were in deferment since. I just recently got notified that my loans have gone into repayment status (for principal and interest). I was paying monthly minimum interest on one of my loans from 2009, as Salliemae changed its private loan structure then.

I'm still in graduate school and am expected to graduate by December 2016. There's no way I can make my monthly repayment sum for the two loans together since I don't have a job that pays decent wage. I'm okay with just paying off minimum interest for both loans until I graduate and find a full time job. What is the best way to deal with this? I called the bank ""account specialist"" who wasn't helpful at all and told me I needed to start paying right now, even if I don't have a full time job that pays $$! I'm thinking about talking to a local credit union to see if they can loan me the money at a lower interest rate, and pay off the loan with Salliemae, but make smaller payments with the credit union and pay as I can.

personalfinance,Financial aid appeal,"I am quite ashamed at the nature of the post I am about to make so I made a throwaway account. I am a senior at a UC college as a pharmacology major, and have a 3.74 overall g.p.a. with a 3.84 major gpa. I would say I am a pretty responsible student. My parents make less 50k a year combined, so I am eligible to receive full financial aid from the federal government. I submitted my fafsa on time and I thought everything was good and that I should be receiving my financial aid. However, there were 3 single page forms that I forgot to do on my school's financial aid website and I ended up turning them in two months late. This led to my financial aid being $4,500 less for the year than it was last year. This is money I really need, so that I can pay my massive rent and not have to take out loans. Luckily, the school is allowing me to make an appeal stating why I was late, so that I could receive the money that I would otherwise been entitled to have had I not been late. On the financial aid website, they state: ""Students with extenuating circumstances that prevented them from meeting financial aid deadlines may file an On-time Status Appeal. The following are generally not considered extenuating circumstances or situations beyond a student’s control that would warrant an appeal for on-time status:

-Lack of knowledge of published financial aid deadlines and application procedures

-Limited means of communication and/or access to computers, email, or the internet

-Events that occurred after or not communicated to our office prior to deadlines

-Failure to complete the FAFSA based on tax filing status if estimated information is available

-A parent’s refusal to provide information on the FAFSA or to our office

-Insufficient financial as a result of missing priority deadlines""

To submit the appeal, all I need to do is attach a simple letter stating why the forms were late and what I could do in the future to rectify this situation (what can I do anyways in the future, I'm a senior). It's pretty safe to say that my circumstances are definitely not extenuating, and I only have one chance to submit an appeal.

Current Income - $45,000  
August 2016 Income - $52,000  
August 2017 Income - $60,000  

**Future Income**  
As a CPA (CA), my future earnings are quite bright. Although I’m just beginning my career and putting in the long hours for low pay now, in the next 3-4 years I’ll have moved on to my actual career and be earning around $80,000 in the Federal Government or more in the private sector. According to Payscale, the average salary for a CA is $97,000 however based on the success of my peers, I will most likely achieve around a $100k salary by the age of 30.  

Additionally, my long term girlfriend of 7 years is studying to be a dentist here in Canada with average salaries in the $170k range.  

**Goals**  
Move out as soon as possible and rent a place downtown close to the office while I work here for 2/3 more years but ensure that I have the financial ability to qualify for a mortgage if a special opportunity comes up. I like the idea of living downtown but my lifestyle is more suited to living in the suburbs with a garage so I’d like to buy a house as soon as my salary allows me to live there comfortably and not be house poor like many of my other friends who bought quickly are.  

Whichever house I purchase must also be easily transferrable into a rental property as I would like to stay mobile enough to transfer to another city for work or my girlfriend if an exciting opportunity presents itself.

**Required Advice**  
From a financing point of view, do banks look at your credit/risk as a whole or do they consider certain holdings or profiles more or less risky? Is it beneficial for me to have all debt lumped together in one large, low interest line of credit or do they prefer to see the separation of student debt and personal debt (auto/boat/etc.)  

Right now, my debt is spread across two institutions and I have $10k locked in to a basic TFSA which is doing nothing for me in terms of earning interest.  

My proposed plan is to extend my main line of credit to $45,000 and payoff/close my TD Visa, transfer my student LoC and close that account, transfer the $10k TFSA to my TD TFSA investing account and pay off my student loan. I’m currently making payments of around $1200 to the various debts but once consolidated, I would be making $1,000 payments to leave enough monthly cash flows for other things such as increased rent/travel/etc.

I also am stuck with medical bills that aren't even factored into that $1800/mo so I can't gain any steam on any of my bills and am constantly paycheck to paycheck. I'm looking for a 2nd job to supplement me for awhile but I got a notice in the mail from One Financial for a personal loan of $6000. 

I realize the interest rate will be high but I using their calculator on their website, if I got a loan even at 29% for 24 mo I'd be paying roughly $1900 in interest over that time. Does this make sense in order to gain the short term boast of getting rid of my maxed out cards on my credit report?

I have a 4 year old car, still in great shape.  Definitely no need to trade it in, but hey, if I can get the Jag I wouldn't hesitate.  The car has a KBB value of $10.4k with its mileage and condition, and I still owe $8.6k at 1.7% interest.  I'm making $270 payments each month, so I'll owe about $7k in 6 months when I would be getting the car.

I've been told I'll be getting a promotion and pay raise at the beginning of the year so realistically, I can afford $600/mo car payment but I would like to keep it under $320/mo and 72 or fewer months.  I don't know if that's even possible, but that's why I'm here.  

What's the best way to get maximum trade value, minimum payment, and minimum interest?  How much will a dealer usually drop from the sticker on a new car (I've only owned used in the past).  What's the best way to handle my current car loan and a new car loan?  Do I have to completely pay off the previous loan since I will be selling off the asset?

1) Should I go through whoever will offer the lowest interest or are there more imperative factors like my amount 
of months going back up that I should look at more heavily than rate?

2) What is the state fee in California to refinance? I've had no luck finding an answer on this.

3) If allowed via rules (don't want anyone to get in trouble for 'advertising') could I get a few names trusted by you guys to go through in terms of lenders?

personalfinance,Remembered I had money that I forgot about,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I'm a 22 year old college student in the US. I'm habitually terrible with budgeting, and due to some semi-recent medical and vehicle-related issues my personal savings are pretty drained - I have about $250 to my name right this second.  I also work retail at $10/hr, ~15 hours a week, and have just started to tutor at $30/hr (!!!), 3 hours a week, making my income ~$960/mo.  Unfortunately, my rent is a bit inflated because of where I live and how close it is to my college campus, about $500/mo.  I'm historically awful at budgeting (it bears repeating) and especially with preparing my own food, although I've made some pretty good progress in this regard, recently.  I'm guessing I spend about $250/mo on food (which makes me wince to read) and just about the rest of my income goes to personal expenditures - dates, occasional media purchases, outings with friends, you get the idea.  My parents are willing to help me get by every now and then (mainly, they're supporting a $100/week [yes, after insurance] doctor's appointment that it's critical that I go to).  However, I know that if I left school (which I'm considering for a variety of reasons), they would be very reluctant to financially support me unless I were to live with them, in a city they recently moved to that's thousands of miles from anyone I know, where the median age is 48 years (as compared to 36 in this college-town-turned-actual-city).

ANYWAY, while I'm sure most of you are twitching at my horrible, horrible irresponsibility, I recently remembered I have ~$525 in a random account I opened with my school's credit union a few years ago with some Christmas money, at my parents' suggestion.  Especially after reading a lot on this subreddit about emergency funds, etc. I have absolutely zero intention to touch this money in the foreseeable future - I do think my parents would be able/willing to help as much as necessary in a true emergency.  The credit union has an APY of 0.65%, which is huge - according to [this](http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2015/01/16/the-10-best-savings-accounts-in-2015), it's five times the average!  However, I was considering putting this into some sort of longer-term investment, like a 10-year bond, for instance (which I believe has an interest rate of 2%).  Is this at all wise?  How else could I put the money to work for me for efficiently, with a focus on minimizing risk?",finance,1444916998

We put $2500 down and took a loan from dealership's financing arm for the remaining $8,000.

Not too bad right?
Well the car was a 2006 Toyota Camry. And the interest rate on the loan is 12.99%.

personalfinance,"Bought a house years ago in a bad area that's getting worse every year, feeling stuck with it.","Let me start by saying I don't have a lot of exact numbers on hand and there are a number of things I don't remember or never fully understood to begin with, so excuse that.


Hi, reddit.  In the fall of 2011 I purchased my first home in a decent sized southern city.  I was approved for something like 150k, but I kept it modest and bought an older home that had been recently redone for about 82k.  The area it was in was not great, but I have no children so I wasn't worried about the schools zone and I used to live a block or two down the road from it for a couple years and never had a problem with crime.  I got a 30 year loan at 4.5% which seemed decent at the time, and I didn't have a lot of cash to put down so my loan has PMI.  I feel like at the start my mortgage was only around 400 a month, 500 and change tops.   

Well, it wasn't long before we had our first break in, the door kicked in and a number of electronics stolen.  I made a claim with my insurance to replace the door and stolen items.  I guess this caused the cost of my insurance to go up, so soon my monthly payment went up a good bit.  I always pay over the minimum and it was still lower than that so I just let it slide.  I first tired to sell my house around this time, to get out of there and go somewhere my belongings would be safer.  My realtor told me at the time that if I listed it for what I owe, her comps showed it would sit on the market for an average of 10 months or longer, there were still a number of houses in the area selling for less at a similar size, and I would be looking at shelling out up to 10,000 dollars in closing costs.  I didn't want to go into debt to be homeless, so I said forget it.  

Years go by and the neighborhood has gotten worse and my property value has gone through the floor.  Houses are foreclosing everywhere around this side of town so all the values are going down.  On top of that, they recently rezoned and say I'm now in a 1% flood zone and am now required to have flood insurance.. Buying that has now raised my mortgage to nearly $700 a month.  Though I've paid over the minimum every month for four years, I'm still at least $5,000 away from paying off my PMI.  

To make matters worse, I don't even live there anymore.  My fiancé refused to live in that house and opted instead to buy a house twice as expensive in a better area and I live with her now, and my house at times causes us friction because I'm not able to help her pay the bills for her house much because I'm paying the bills for my own house.  Ever so often she will bust out a ""If you REALLY wanted to sell that house, then you would"" implying that I'm not trying to get rid of it at all because I want a place to go after I break up with her.. So yeah, it's putting some strain on the relationship.  

I've tried to lessen the burden some by renting out a couple rooms in there, with the hope I could actually make some money off it and then maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be stuck with it but so far that isn't working out super well.  I'm getting a good bit of money on rent but still not quite enough to cover what I owe each month after I pay my usual over the minimum amount, plus the renters are under no lease or contract as I have no idea how to go about doing something like that legally and correctly.  I've tried to refinance it once before about two years ago and at that time it was declined saying I owe too much on it, I haven't tried since then.  One of the renters would love to ""rent to own"" one day because their credit is abysmal and they can't get a loan to buy it but that just sounds like a bigger headache for me.  

I would love to just walk away from it and not have it be my responsibility anymore, but I have fantastic credit and don't want to lose that... So I'm looking for advice on how to proceed.  I feel like my only option is kick out a bunch of friends who are already down on their luck anyway so I can invest thousands of dollars I don't have into fixing it up to list it for sale so it can sit empty for a year and maybe sell for less than I owe eventually, or try to works some magic and get a better interest rate and lower my payments so that their rent will cover it.  Or should I bite the bullet and ride it out until the PMI drops off and hopefully the payment goes way down with it?

I haven't been making additional payments towards the principle and I'm wondering if I should be. Will how much equity I have make a difference financially if I'm planning on selling it?

personalfinance,Applied for Sallie Mae loan and it was disbursed but my school didn't notify me and they didn't apply it to my account balance.,"Hey all,

So last year I had an account balance with my university around $13k but I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue on with this school and decided to take the semester off. Instead of register for classes, I applied for a Sallie Mae loan for $10k to cover some of the previous semester's tuition and I would pay the rest out of pocket. I went to financial aid and they said it was too late to register which was fine but they said it was too late to do anything about the Sallie Mae loan.

Fast forward to this year. I was having a rough time with my finances and couldn't make payments for about 5 months. I have a FedLoan I pay $400 a month, rent and bills, living expenses and just got so far in the hole it hurts. The account was sent into collections.

On top of all this, I get an email from Sallie Mae saying my account is overdue. Confused, I look at my account and it says that a 10k loan was disbursed to my school the previous year! I look back at my school balance and I'm stunned...it definitely was not.

At this point the Sallie Mae account had accrued 3 months of interest and payments which I then made payments to so they wouldn't show up as a negative on my credit history, to get back to good standing. 

Finally, after getting the run around for the past 3 months, the school admitted they made a mistake and ""overlooked"" the loan disbursement and it was never applied to my debt with them. They said they will be doing a ""return to lender"".

So my question now is what happens to the money I paid Sallie Mae in interest since this loan was basically unused and benefitted me in no way? Also, I haven't checked yet but I'm pretty sure there's going to be a delinquent loan payment on my credit history that needs to get wiped out. 

On top of that I've been getting constant phone calls from Sallie Mae to pay my loan, like 3-4 times a day during work and after work, automated junk. Isn't there something against getting called for a false debt or does that not matter cuz its my school's fault and not Sallie Mae? 

I just want this nightmare to be over so I can give my money to someone else and move on.

personalfinance,(Taxes) Lost Two Jobs This Year and Have ? On Individual Shared Responsibility Penalty,"I don’t have health care. I’m a bad person but wait I can explain! Kind of. In the past year I suffered multiple job losses and therein lost my insurance coverage, I now work for an employer who offers it and will be insured January 1, 2016 – but this year I’m a little confused about how to go about preparing for the tax bill upcoming.




Essentially the individual shared responsibility as I understand it is – for every month you don’t have insurance, you owe 2% or something like $300/person whichever is greater in penalty of what I assume is your gross income. My thought would be you owe in example 300 on 30k gross or 2.5% on anything higher than 30k. I would now fall into the 2nd bracket.


**Backstory:** 

**2014**
I bought a house in Sept. 2014 with my fiancée, she is currently going to school full time and I’m supporting us both during this. I had a good job and it wasn’t an issue at all. I had great healthcare and she had her own. Income was $50,100 a year gross.


**2/15/15**

I was terminated with severance (mass layoff wooooo!) They provided for my health insurance until 3/31 when I signed a waiver not to sue and blah blah plus 2 weeks pay.  Income $0


**3/7/15**
Apply for unemployment, request forbearance on student loans, get my IBR fed loans back to $0 payments, cancel cellphone and move to cheapest I can find. We cut costs considerably and are floating by all right. Income $425/week untaxed from Ohio Unemployment Insurance. 


**3/15/15** 
I become employed with a job as a mechanic (totally not my field but hey, do what you’ve gotta do right?) and I begin making $16.85/hr working 40 a week minus the union dues, even though I’m not in the union until 90 days. Health coverage promised after 90 days.


**4/1/15** 
Officially uninsured, and cobra is like $900 a month, but with insurance starting in 75 days I’m not going to sweat it.

**4/15/15**
Company decides maintenance is overstaffed. I’m laid off again (but my manager was pretty darn cool, put it in writing not at fault and that they’re cutting back on employees where they can. Back on unemployment $425/week un-taxed (well, un-witheld, it's going to be taxed). No insurance.


**6/1/15** 
Get lucky, get a good job an hour drive away. Salary, 40k going up to $45 after 6 months. The gas is an extra expense but I like my job and the hours are good. Health insurance after 60 days.


**Today**
This brings me to where I am now. HR never followed up with me on insurance but it wouldn’t have mattered anyway – health care cost at work as a smoker is something like $300/month for an individual as myself (though pretax).  I would literally not be able to afford my $250/mo student loans, $750 mortgage, plus auto ins, utilities etc etc etc plus paying all my fiancée’s bills (one more semester and we’re both working, this becomes a non issue). 


*Sidenote* - I’ve quit smoking so it brings it inline with what I can afford come 1/1/2016 and plan to enroll next week for the new year. 


This comes to the meat of my question and what I’m trying to prepare for come April 15th 2015: What do I need to do to prepare for tax season?

I know my income will fall between 35-45k gross for the year.  I was insured 4 months out of the year, my insurance then dropped and I couldn’t afford cobra and didn’t attempt the exchange because I thought I would be insured with the maintenance gig.  

The health care at my new job I 

1. Missed enrolling in
2. Couldn’t  actually afford the extra $150 a month smoker penalty. We’ve already cut out all we could to get by based on our circumstances. Short of borrowing money, it wasn’t going to happen. 

I don’t believe I qualify for any of the exemptions (health insurance wasn’t an individual plan cancelled, it was a group plan through work). None of this would be as bad had been that bad if job 1 had panned out. But now from April – Dec I will be uncovered and I‘m just not sure what to expect as far as a tax bill comes, I have to start scraping and saving now.

I don’t even know how to estimate what I’ll owe. Is it based on gross? Is it based on AGI? Will it just reduce what refund I have after my deductions (home interested deduction, mortgage credit certificate, student loan interest, etc). Any guidance would be helpful.


***TL;DR - Poor planning and job loss have caused me to screw myself on my 2015 taxes due to the individual shared responsibility provision and I'm having trouble figuring out how bad it is going to be***


Edit* I said something like $300 for current health care at work - I believe it's $75 a pay smoker penalty (paid every 2 weeks) plus the base insurance which I BELIEVE to be something like $80 a pay. So not quite $300.",finance,1444952334

My boyfriend and I have been together almost 20 years, and aren't interested in getting married (plus face a heavy income tax penalty if we do get married). We bought a house in San Francisco 5 years ago for around $400k, with very little down, so actually ""owned"" very little of the value. We have joint tenancy, so if one of us dies, the other person gets the house without going through probate. But, since we are unmarried, I assume the surviving person has to pay 50% of the house value in inheritance taxes? We recently refinanced to get a better rate, and because the bay area is insane, our house was appraised at $890k. So suddenly I am concerned about how the federal government would determine the house's value for inheritance taxes. The city can only raise property taxes a small amount a year, so the city has our house valued at $450k. We still owe $375k on the mortgage. I'm having a hard time finding out both what taxes a surviving non spouse need to pay and how a house that doesn't need to go through probate is valued. I did try the internet but am still confused.

What value do these articles add?  Does anyone really pay attention to them?  How accurate / justified are their explanations?  They seem to swing back and forth on a day to day basis.  I've heard that many of these articles are actually algorithmically generated.

personalfinance,"This is my first time doing taxes, I'm frozen with anxiety about getting started because I can't wrap my head around how to reconcile multiple accounts. There's probably a simple way to do it but I'm hitting a wall. I would really appreciate some advice.","Hi PF, let me start by saying I really feel like a fool about all of this and I ask for your pity.

I need to file federal taxes in the U.S. I have never done taxes before and I have procrastinated my way right up to the 2014 extension deadline (**edit:** with all the downvotes, I suppose I should mention that 2014 is the first year that I've needed to do taxes). I am basically frozen with anxiety, I can't bring myself to start actually doing them because fundamentally I don't know exactly *how* to do what I need to do. I would greatly appreciate advice. I feel like this is something people probably deal with all the time, so maybe (hopefully) the answer is easier than I think).

**A brief intro to my situation:**

I have a personal bank account and a personal PayPal account. I also have a PayPal account for my business (which is a sole proprietorship, so technically just a third personal account as far as taxes are concerned).

So the basics (as I understand) is that I need to add up my income from the year and then deduct my business expenses. For a single account this should be easy enough, even easier for someone with a paycheck of the same recurring value, but my own monthly takehome from my business fluctuates every month. 

So in many cases I would transfer funds from my personal bank account to my personal PayPal account (and sometimes from there to my business PayPal account), and I just don't see a logical way to reconcile these together such that I don't sometimes double up on figures when suming my income.

For example, let's say I get paid $150 into my personal account, then I transfer that money to my PayPal account. That transfer to my PayPal account looks an awful lot like a normal payment into that account (income), but if I don't somehow account for this then I'd be recording $300 in income when it was really just $150 income and then moved from one account to another. The same issue happens when I transfer money *from* my PayPal account to my bank account.

In PayPal I suppose I can get a list of all of the *transfers* back and forth (such that I can see them separately from plain income and spending), and I could probably manually sort them into one master income list between the two accounts, but this seems incredibly tedious. And if this is the only way, I feel like I can't envision a logical system to even lay it out in a spreadsheet, it would just be a mess. It would probably be fairly trivial is PayPal transfers were instant (because I could align dates), but they take some period of days which can vary.

Ugh... as I continue to think about this the solution seems within my grasp but it just isn't clicking. I suppose both the deduction/withdraw lists for each account could be combined somehow to sort things out?

Hard to describe this feeling... shame/embarrassment. It feels like I should know how to do taxes or at least be able to figure this out, but I'm stuck. Really wish the school system had taught me how to do taxes instead of how to make a bridge out of toothpicks or sew a pillow.

**TL;DR:** I need to create a 'master transaction list' from three accounts that avoids doubling up on the income side of things when there's money transferred between the accounts",finance,1444966113
personalfinance,Student Loan Counseling?,"So I'm a little hopeless when it comes to personal finance related issues and was hoping people could shed some light on this situation for me. 

I'm a recent law school grad, started working about a month ago. No savings whatsoever (like I said, I'm bad at this stuff) and am very much financially independent from parents and the like. I'm sitting on about $120,000 in student loans but the lion's share of those are Federal loans. Because I'm working in a public interest field, I'll  be eligible for public interest loan forgiveness in 10 years. I have to start paying these back in December and want to start preparing and budgeting now. I'm considering using a student loan counseling service to help me navigate this process because, like I said, not financially savvy, and I'm also the first person in my family to graduate from any higher education so I don't have anyone to help me through this. So a counseling service seems appealing. 

Currently, my plan is to consolidate my federal loans into a 30-year income-based repayment plan so that I get the most bang out of the loan forgiveness (unfortunately, if it gets repealed in the next 10 years I will be screwed) and make more sizeable payments into my two private loans (both around 10K each) as my budget allows. Right now my objective is to keep my monthly payments as low as possible for the next year or so, because I'm trying to save to move in the next 6 months and basically ""get on my feet"" (pay off some credit card debt, start saving, etc.).

The services I've been looking into are quoting around $125 for a counseling session/budget plan and I'm just wondering if it's worth it. Do these services really provide a $125 value? Because I JUST started working, money is super tight right now, so I want to be sure before taking the plunge.",finance,1444966500

This includes male or female, name, looks, and even a standard selection of voices and character histories. Once your character is customized the first scene in the game is your characters friends being dicks to them while on a road trip. Your characters first sentence to them is. ""That's it i'm not talking to any of you till we get home."" Throughout the rest of the game all conversations are literal ""Text"" options you use on your phone. You and your friends are investigating a literal ghost city in hopes to shoot your movie there. When you get seperated by falling through the floor down two stories into a basement and they go to try to get you out while you search for a way out. Your main inventory items are your Laptop in a bag and your phone. Your phone has a camera. This does not fight the ghosts ,creatures ,magic, or crime scenes you encounter. It is however the ""pokemon snap"" for forensics who get the phone at the end of the game and if you get enough pictures instead of sending a couple beat cops, or sending a couple feds, or a priest and a paranormal hunting team the military comes in and utterly completely destroys the town and all the creatures in it.

personalfinance,May need to sell a house about a year after buying it - I could use some advice.,"I took a job in another state recently and moved.  However, my old job has asked me to apply and I expect they're going to be offer me a better job than I had.  I really would like to go back there, but I sold my house down there and bought a house up here.  The cost of housing where I moved from is lower, so I had to spend a good bit more to get a comparable up here.  

I'd probably be putting it back on the market about a year after I bought it should this happen.  The closing costs were only about $7500 and the seller paid $5500 of that.  I paid for the inspections and stuff like that.  If my old employer offers me this position, they would offer a moving allowance as well.  

My current house (in Kansas) is very nice, on several acres, bordering federal land near a reservoir.  I can walk down there and fish.  I bought it for $345k (339.5k really, I got the closing costs also), and it appraised for $360k.  I put down 20%.  The woman I bought from told me that a new factory is going up about 15 minutes from where my house is and that all the property in the area (a very rural area) is going to be worth a lot more next year.  But, I figure a cycle like that takes a few years to really impact home prices.  

I've always been told that you need about 5 years living in a home to break even.  What do you think, PF?  How bad of a bath would I take on this house if I did sell it within a year?

Edit:  My salary, adjusted for cost of living, would be about the same as what I'm making now, but I really like the community where my old job is and I have a lot of friends and contacts there.  Plus, it's closer to my family.

personalfinance,401k v. Student Loans (High Income),"I know this issue has been hashed out, but I couldn't find a thread with numbers similar to mine so I thought I would start my own thread. My apologies for any redundancy. 

My info: Salary ~160k, Student loan debt ~160k, loans are currently being refinanced (expected interest rate is 3.1%-3.5% variable). Minimum payment on the loans should be just shy of $3k/month (it's a 5 year repayment plan). I am in my late 20s. 

No employer matching on my 401k. My thought process was that because the $18,000 maximum pre-tax contribution comes right off of the top of my income, which will be taxed at 28%, shipping $18k into my 401k shows an immediate ~5k return. My 401k money is then put into a retirement-age targeted mutual fund. The compound dividends + immediate tax benefit seems to outweigh accelerating my student loan payments. 

Am I wrong here? Should I be making a smaller contribution until I get my loans paid off?",finance,1445010546
personalfinance,Financing car vs Keeping cash for a bigger downpayment on coming house pourchase ? (BE),"Hi Reddit!

I (27) am starting my freelancing business (computer engineer) and thus I need a car. I already signed 2 big contracts which would gross me about 130k€ per year, so, feeling pretty safe, I went ahead and purchased my old company car for 10k€ with my own money.

Due to recent events my girlfriend (28) and I are looking to buy for our first house/appartement.

So I went to the bank today for some administrative tasks and the teller asked if I already bought a car for my business, which I confirmed. He proposed to finance it, which it seems he can do up to 3 months after the date of purchase. Later on he made me an offer to finance it for 2,73% for 3 years (307€/m).

I also asked them about a what I could borrow for a house and they told me that if I have the necessary amount for a downpayment (about 15%), I could borrow basically anything I wanted because of the security I have in my field and that I am already fully booked for a year by contract.

So I'm thinking to finance the car so I can get a higher down payment on the house. Is it wise to do so ? I guess financing the car will lower my credit rating but on the other hand, having a bigger down payment will decrease the interest rate I can negotiate.

Keep in mind that I plan on fiscally deducting 70% of all costs relating to the car over 3 years (including a potential financing), because it is used for business purposes, which my accountant confirmed is ok.

What would you recommend ?

personalfinance,Private Loan in Mom's Name Coming Back to Haunt Us,"A bit of a backstory here.  My wife and I took out some federal loans for school and we paid them off earlier this year, several years after graduation.  While my wife was in school, she also had to take out some parent plus loans, some of which are in her mom's name only, some of which are in her mom's AND aunt's name as the cosigner.  It was the agreement between my wife and her mom, that her mom would pay for these loans at the time.
All along, we were told by her mom that she was paying these off for the last four years.  It was just found out the other day, that she had deferred them for several years, and now they are two months behind.  Her mom's new plan, is to either declare bankruptcy or wait for them to garnish her wages.  She unfortunately already has very poor credit.
What we would like to do, is pay off the loans that her aunt is on the hook for (about 32k @ 8%), so it does not affect her credit negatively.  We are looking at ways to do this, but we seem we can, with still having some savings, it will just set back some life goals of buying a house and traveling unfortunately.

If we pay off the ones the aunt is on the hook for, and the mom defaults on the ones just signed out for her, will this ever hurt the aunt's credit or possibly my wife and I's credit?

If we bite the bullet and withdrawal from life savings and pay the 32k, is there anything we could possibly do with taxes?

Any other advice that you guys might have would be appreciated, its a bit of a shocker.  If we had known this would happen all along, we would have paid off this higher interest loan first before some of the smaller 3% ones.",finance,1445011637

personalfinance,"28 Years old, in a ""marginal"" amount of old debt. Not really sure how to go about resolving it.","Hi /r/personalfinance! Let me first start by saying thank you. You guys have helped my wife and I budget. I've been lurking for months and just reading posts has helped our situation tremendously. 

Now for a little backstory. My wife and I previously lived in Iowa, and made decent money(50-60k each) when we first got married. After a while, she got pregnant and we decided after we had our son that we'd like to move to Texas in search of higher pay and a better quality of life(more entertainment options, newer house, etc.) What happened turned into a nightmare. I'm in sales and the company I took a position with in Dallas went bankrupt 3 months after we moved here. She was staying home with the baby at the time so her portion of the income dropped to zero. It was tight on my income alone but still doable, just less meals out, cutting out cable, the normal stuff you do when income shrinks. When my company went bankrupt, I was obviously forced to find another position with a different company. I ended up taking a terrible base paying job($8 hour) that promised high commissions but never really delivered. My highest commission check in the year I stayed with them was $1000. In that time my wife had gone back to work at a daycare in order to get free care for our son . The daycare that he's at charges $1200 a month. That coupled with $10 an hour seemed like it was a good idea. In hindsight it wasn't nearly enough, and we began to see our sizable savings account start being whittled away by car repairs, house repairs and medical bills. Next thing you know, $15,000.00 in savings was completely gone. Surviving on a combined $20 an hour was impossible with the bills we had.

You all probably know what happens next. Car payments went 2 months past due on each vehicle(never reposessed though), internet got shut off, student loans went past due, stopped being able to afford health insurance, and we maxed out all 3 of my credit cards. My previously great fico score took a gigantic hit. I went from 750 to 480 from 2012-2014. In early 2014 I was finally able to get a much better paying job, and since then have gotten current on both car payments, got insurance again through work, got squared up with my federal student loans, and life is seemingly back to normal in some sense. There are a few glaring issues though which I'll list below. I want to take care of these bills, but would also like the negative remarks removed from my credit file if that's even possible. I have NO idea how to go about this, so here's where you come in. We'd like to purchase a house in the next year or so, and all of the negative accounts on my file have to be taken care of first. Help me get my credit score back!

I also have two vehicles that are still financed.One has $4800 left to pay and the other is $3760. They are both in current status. I had a Capital One credit card that had a $300 balance on it, it's showing as ""closed-$0 balance"" on my credit file so I don't know what that means. I also have a TD Bank credit card that says ""closed-$2650 balance"". What do I do with these? They aren't showing up as in collections. Did the company write these off as a loss, or do I still need to take care of them somehow?

I currently make roughly $5000 a month before tax, my wife makes $1600 a month before tax and is in nursing school. We have $2200 in savings, we've been paying cash for her classes, so as not to take on any more debt. I don't have any credit cards, don't go shopping for anything that we don't need, etc. I'd just like to know which of these accounts to knock out first, and what steps to take in order to have the negativity removed from my credit file, if that's even possible. I'll list all of our bills below, just so everyone can see what we've got to work with every month.

Rent($990 mo.)-In lease until next August
Car payment($270)
Car payment($263)
Car insurance($155)-Full coverage on both through Esurance.
Student Loans($72.39)
Utility bill($250 average, including electric,trash and hot water)
Natural Gas bill($25-30)
Cellphone Bill($260)-This includes both of my in-laws, and my parents. Everyone chips in so our portion is roughly $120 with tax.
Groceries($200-$300 a month)
Gym Membership($30 a month)
Wife's classes($190 a month)-These are at a community college so there's no way to cut them down any lower.

I am a very frugal guy and have no debt other than my mortgage. I want to invest it, quit my job, and travel for a year or so living off dividends/rental income. My mom thinks this a terrible mistake and I should invest all of it now, not touch it til I retire at the usual age of 65ish. I have been reading up on early retirement for years now, structuring my life to obtain it, and have no plans on being in the rat race until 65. 


About me: I'm a 29 year old man in the US, no wife or kids, no desire to have either, and my yearly expenses for everything (including mortgage) runs around 21k, and I'm always trying to drive it down further through frugality.

85k a year salary 

250k home equity

100k in work 401k 

26k in Roth IRA outside of work

25k of dividend paying stocks

11k of vanguard stocks

15k in savings

100k left on my mortgage @ 3.5%


My options:
Part of me wants to use it all to pay off my mortgage and then rent my house out for $2500 a month. I live downtown near a popular bar/restaurant district and will never have trouble finding tenants. That's 30k a year (- property tax and property management fees) which can easily cover my expenses (which would drop a lot being free of mortgage/utility bills) and health insurance...and could probably even keep contributing to my Roth IRA at 5.5k/year. I know this is best case scenario and there can always be major home repairs or shitty tenants. 


The arguement against this plan is that 3.5% interest rate on my mortgage is super low and that the stock market has a long history of returning 4-6% so it'd be more profitable to go that route and continue making normal mortgage payments. I currently pay 1500 a month in mortgage, including tax and homeowners insurance, so I could still net 12k (- taxes and fees) a year if I rent it out now. 


So my questions to you pros out there are should I pay off my house, or invest, or a combo of the two? Should I keep buying dividend paying stocks or get more low-fee vanguard stocks?

My concern is this: I am fully aware I need more bonds in my portfolio. I have 3K in cash I could throw into bonds immediately and continue adding more with each paycheck, but since an interest rate hike is inevitable (I realize there is debate about how far out it is, but it is inevitable nonetheless), meaning bond prices will fall, the safest place for my money till that time is in my checking account, is it not? I know ""market timing"" is frowned upon here, but I feel like planning for an inevitability doesn't really qualify - am I wrong?

2012 in Idaho, I was uninsured due to a bad work situation. I developed acute pancreatitis as a complication of gall stones, which required several days of treatment and required 2 surgeries in 2 separate hospitals. I amassed around $45k in debt in under a week. Shortly thereafter, I landed a great job and handled a significant amount of my debt through a debt recovery program. I have only one remaining account left over from this experience.

The hospital claims my interest rate is 18%. The original balance was $19k. To date, I have paid them a total of $16k. Remaining balance, somehow, is $12k. I am currently paying around $840/mo. The hospital refuses to negotiate on interest or principal. I'm no accountant but the amount we have paid them vs the amount of interest seems way higher than 18%.

We are paying the hospital directly, the account is not in collections. Their collections agency is actually much better to work with and has far lower interest rates. However, allowing such a large balance to go to collections will destroy all of the credit repair work we have done over the last 3 years. We have plans to build a home and do not want to put that dream in jeopardy.

Advice we have received so far has been to pay it off with a personal loan or credit card, but the interest rates we've been quoted there aren't much better. I have since read of several instances of county hospitals being sued for such high interest rates.

Do I have any legal recourse here? Are we being screwed over? Should I suck it up and get a loan at a slightly lower interest rate? Should I sacrifice our credit and the possibility of building a home in order to take the lower interest rate from the collections agency? Are there any other options?

personalfinance,Ex-girlfriend tries to collect her security deposit from me,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I am mainly interested in your opinions about the matter I'll try to explain below. No sob stories I promise, but there's some math.
So last September (2014) my friends (two of them) and me needed an apartment. Pali (one of my friends) and me just got back from the USA from some summertime job, and Nyugger (my other friend) was in my home country (Hungary), so we asked him to find us an apartment. Pali and me did the internet-search-thingy, looking for apartments for rent, we sent it to Nyugger, and he checked them out.
Long story short, just before we became homeless, we found an apartment which was appropriate for our needs, just a bit expensive. It costed 135 000 HUF (Hungarian Forints) per month, so we had to pay 45 000 per person for this apartment, plus utilities. Since it was the end of August, and we needed a place to live from September, we decided to take it.
That was the time when I got back (again) with my (now ex-) girlfriend, and since we knew each other for a long time, I simply asked her to move in with us. She agreed, we rented the apartment (4 of us), and we lived happily ever after. Well, not that much.

We had to pay a security deposit of 2 months rental fee, which was 270 000 HUF.
At this point I would like to state that the minimum wage in Hungary is 105 000 HUF per month, so now you see that the apartment was quite expensive. But we needed a place to live, to go to school, to work.
So we took the apartment, just the 4 of us, and things were going smooth, troubles started at around January 2015.
My (ex)girlfriend went through some crysis, I don't know what happened, maybe just the fact that we lived together, and I needed some space apart from her, despite the fact that I loved her truly, she did not take it well. I just wanted to enjoy some hours of gaming mostly, and we were both working at full-time jobs, so the optimal hours for this were the hours when we were at home, but she wanted to be together, etc, I'm sure you know the drill. It wasn't lack of love, I was simply interested in other things as well.
However, I don't know if she cheated or not, or what happened, but she started to act really... distance-keeping. She started to sleep in the hotel she worked at, for longer periods of time, and eventually we broke up. I couldn't put up with her lies (she lied a lot about weed), and didn't even mind her ""moving away"", I thought this will strengthen her love and eventually realizing that I'm more important than weed and lies.
This was not the case, however, and we broke up in Ferburay as I remember. She moved in the hotel she worked at, I didn't mind, as I was truly fed up with her lies.
Here comes the finance part.

I mentioned that before moving in, we had to pay a security deposit of 270 000 HUF (more than two months of minimum wage!) to the landlord. That was 67 500 HUF per person. She paid her part, and in September 2015, my friends and I moved out of there, and we used the security deposit to cover July's and August's rental fees (It's two months, remember?). So when moving out, we did not get it back, but at least we didn't have to pay rental fee in July and August, just like an advance payment.

Let's get to the point now.
It's October 2015, and she wants her security deposit back. It would cost 22 500 HUF (67 500 / 3) for each of us.
When we (my friends and I) discussed this matter in June or so, eventually we came to an agreement that she should get her security deposit back. I was for it, my friends were against it. My point was that she did not do any damage to the apartment, so she deserves it. My friends' point was that she cancelled an official agreement, and therefore, her part of the security deposit is lost. A strong point in this is that if she sued us, we would probably win, as this is certainly a cancellation of an official agreement, which contains that if the renters move out, security deposit is not given back.

So she moved out in around Ferbuary or March (can't remember), and the rental fee - now for the three of us - increased. We had to pay 45 000 HUF per month per person for three or four months, which is 11 250 HUF more than the original rental fee - half the security deposit we should pay back to her per person (22 500 HUF).

To put things in a more fact-orinted environment: while she saved three or four months of rental fee, we had to pay three or four months more (11 250 HUF per months) than we agreed on, but also, she paid her part of living there, and se did not do any damage to the apartment. Should we pay back her security deposit?

I'm happy to answer any questions which might be relevant to make a decision. Thank you for your support guys!",finance,1445031686

personalfinance,"We want to start planning to buy a home, looking for advice on what to plan for","Hey /r/personalfinance,

So my wife and I are about to move and really want to start planning for the future. 

We are fairly young (26/7) we have college debt, auto debt, and some credit card debt. 

As far as our credit history goes we don't have any negatives against us, just not a super long AAoA and right now we have a non-ideal credit utilization ratio. 

My credit score (as reported by Discover) is in the low 700s, I'm not sure about my wife's at the moment, it may be a little lower since she has more credit debt (although i have more auto debt as her car is virtually paid off).

We are about to move to new jobs making a substantial amount more than we do now (I'll be making as much as we do combined right now) while moving to a much cheaper area (Orange County, CA to Portland, OR). 

We would like to start getting our finances in order but also want to make sure we do things in the right order. 

I know the basics:

* Get a budget
* Build an emergency fund
* Max retirement
* ... 
* Profit

What I want to know is where to put in paying off my debt and saving for a downpayment on a home. 

We have a budget, combined we are expecting to have 3.5-4k per month for ""discretionary"" spending. This could go to fun stuff, down payment savings, or additional debt relief but does not need to include basic necessities like food, gas, or basic entertainment (eating out 1-3 times per month, etc). 

By my calculation we will be debt free in 10 months if we put the whole 3.5-4k per month to debt. If we were to pay off all the debt (other than student loans) we would be at closer to 4.5-5k/month  (current minimum payments on cars and credit cards are probably close to 1k/month total). 

Our rent will probably be in the 1300-1500 range and we would be looking at a 3-400k mortgage which would put our monthly payment (with insurance, property tax, and PMI (depending on out downpayment percentage we are doing 10% minimum but are hoping to get to 20%) 1900-2400/month (looking more at the  3-350k range which would be closer to 1900-2100/month).

So now that the overview is complete here are my questions:

1) From a bank perspective, if I have a 20% cash downpayment but have some debt what am I looking at as far as approval and interest rates goes? How much does this matter to the process?

2) Would it be better to blow all the debt out of the water and THEN start saving the down payment? This would put me at actually buying a home in 18-24 months most likely or would it be better to try and get the house sooner (since I know property prices are going up and interest rates are currently low) and then work on the debt more aggressively? My logic is kind of that if I'm going to be spending 13-1500/month on rent while I have 3-4k 'extra' I'd rather take 500 of that 'extra' and put it toward housing so I can start gaining equity sooner. 

At this point NOTHING is happening for at least 12 months (we are going to sign a 12-mont lease so we have time to save, pay debt, etc) but I'd like to know what the consensus is for the best plan of attack.

Thanks!

Edit: I should also note that I'm taking into account emergency funds/retirement. I'm maxing my employer contibution at first while I get some savings/debt taken care of. I've got a large signing bonus which is going straight to savings and should account for a 3 month minimum emergency fund.",finance,1445043331

Don't know what to tackle first.","TL;DR: **Don't know if I should put my money into savings with a minor increase in my monthly loan payments, or if I should directly tackle the loans while stifling all my other expenses and savings.**

As the title says, I landed my first full-time job last week. I'm going to be making about $35,000 before taxes, so I'm expecting a net annual salary of around $25k. 

I am lucky in that the job is about five minutes away by car, especially lucky considering I live in a rural area (Central NJ). Currently, I need my parents to drive me to work because I haven't had the ability to save money for a car when I was earning minimum wage.

I'm paying $417 a month into private loans, and currently have a federal loan that is based on IBR so I'm not paying anything towards it right now. It'll go up in August of next year, coinciding with the one year IBR period. I don't have a degree as I dropped out in my second year of college. 

My main goal right now is to get a car within the next two to three months. I'll be paying the minimum payments on my loans with about $30 in other expenses, the rest going into savings. Each pay period (Bi-weekly) I will probably be taking home ~$1,048. So that means that after my $417 into the loan and the $30 in expenses, the rest is going into savings towards a used car. Insurance is a minor concern, but I'll be on my parent's plan so I won't have an insanely high payment. I'm estimating about $180 a month. With a 2-3 month goal, that most likely means I'll need to finance a car. My maximum I can afford is about $280 a month adding in calculated expenses for gas and other oddities. I'm aiming for a monthly payment of about $160 though, with my car price goal being from $5000-$9000. I plan on making around a $3000 down payment. 

After those 2-3 months though I'm not too sure where to put my money. I can:

* Tackle my loans entirely, doing minor ($100) deposits into my savings, and expect to kill all of them off in two years. That seems risky to me as my savings won't be too hot in terms of balance. 

* The alternative is continuing semi-minimum monthly payments with some type of increase (Instead of a planned $1000 extra, probably more around $100-$200) and putting it into savings towards saving for a programming boot camp. I'm currently looking at App Academy, which requires a $5000 deposit. My goal is to get a job in software and start doing what I always wanted to do. My monthly savings budget would probably be equivalent to what I would have put towards the loans.

I'm not sure at all which route to go. It's nice to finally have options, but it's still stressful trying to find the best path.

personalfinance,Finally have our heads above water after winging it for 3 years...what are we missing?,"We have 2 kids and made less than $50k between the two of us for all three years of our life together. Our savings dwindled and the credit cards kept growing. Childcare is ruinously expensive. To maintain a middle-class lifestyle, it felt like a giant runaway snowball, the lifestyle just begets and begets. And we were drowning, unhappy, and never saw each other. 

**So we followed some of the primary advice on here:**

* **Reduce expenses** - well, we were already living on a shoestring

* **Make more money** - Since reducing expenses was negligable, My husband got a better paying job, but in exchange was working like 14 hour days and the health insurance premiums alone were killing us.

**So we decided to take a job in a weird country**. 

We sold our house and almost all of our possessions. **Overnight, we eliminated all of our debt** (both fortunate to not have had any student loans). 

We did not have any auto loans as we tend to buy vehicles in cash, but we did get some liquid cash for the move out of them and that was nice. **But we had about $13k in credit card debt that we were basically ignoring. YIKES. Holy shit.** Never doing that again!

Once that burden was off our shoulders, we moved into a situation where health care is free, housing is free, full-time childcare for our oldest is free, and we get a stipend for vehicle expenses. And my husband is making more than he was back home. 

**We opened an IRA and made a budget that accounts for living on roughly 50% of his income with the plan to use the rest for savings and travel**. 

**At the moment, we have $15k in liquid savings** in a Barclay's account at 1% interest rate. I wanted to keep our emergency fund separate from the main accounts so I sort of ""forget"" that it's there. 

**Our main goals here are travel and retirement savings**. I think that we can probably max out 2 IRAs every year we are here, **which is about 1/4 of our total income... is that not good enough?**

Then we have a long-term savings goal separate from our emergency fund. We want to take a year off for a family sabbatical to travel together, in a few years when our kids are a little older. Saving for this is less of a priority than retirement and traveling, but I do set some aside every paycheck. Right now I just leave this floating in our foreign savings account, but I suppose it would be best to move this to another Barclay's account, yes? So it's accessible but ""Set aside""?

**We know we need to plan for college**. There are too many variables between the individual college savings accounts and I am overwhelmed. **And, we don't know what state we will end up in (or even if we will end up back in the States)--so basically, should we wait on investing for college until we have a firm plan about where we want to end up in the future?** We've discussed remaining abroad indefinitely, but probably not in this particular country. 

We are trying to make good choices. Mastering the psychology of money has been a far greater challenge. 

We made our first budget this month. I think it will take several months of trial-and-error before we really get a firm handle on where things should be, but the savings goal always remains the same and gets withdrawn the same every month. We get paid in a week and are making poor person food though. **We are pretty much out of money**. So we need to plan things better next month. 

**So my point is, thank you for all the solid advice**. It has helped guide us to a better situation. But we still have no idea if we are doing things ""right"".",finance,1445096630

It just seems like a 200$ promo is better than good interest rates for the short term, and then I'll eventually put anything in a higher-interest savings account like Ally or Barclays or something.

personalfinance,Getting out of car loan without making my credit even worse.,"Last year me and my husband separated. Without going through the nasty court ordeal, I just decided to give him everything that he purchased back to him. This included our family car. Since we have a young son, I had to get a car of my own. I'm pretty sure my parent's credit scores are in the negatives so neither of them could co-sign for me. I guess I should also mention that I'm 22. When I had my son he went to the NICU, thus my insurance refused to pay for his birth. Leaving me $20k in debt. So when I purchased my car I went to some hole in the wall dealership who would approve just about anyone. I didn't even get to pick out the car. They picked it out and said it was the only one that the bank would approve for me. (A 2012 Ford Focus SE) So I ended up with a car I did not like, a 24% interest rate, $315.00 a month payment and to top it off, the vehicle ended up getting two recalls on the transmission 2 months later after me purchasing it. I've taken it to Ford twice to get it ""fixed."" The first time, they said it was just an update. When I took it home, the problem was even worse. The transmission jumps and slips out of gear way too often. So I immediate took it back and they said I needed a new clutch. (clutches are in automatic transmissions as well.) The problem with this is, they don't know when this clutch will be available. I'm tired of driving and paying for this crap. What should i do? I owe about $9,000 more. Any advice besides saying I'm screwed?",finance,1445103308

personalfinance,22 year old in bad financial standing,"I'm looking for some input into how to get my finances in order aside from better money management.  I guess I'll put it all on the table so I can get the best feedback:

Credit score: ~510
Savings: $0
Monthly Income: ~$3,600
Monthly Expenses:
 Rent: $775
 Car Insurance: $100
 Gas: $140
 Phone: $40
 Food: ~$350

Those are all my legitimate expenses aside from spending money and things here and there.

Doesn't seem like a problem, I have almost $2,200 a month left over...right?

However, at the end of this month I'll owe a total of $1,150 towards rent, $1,400 to my credit union in overdrafts and credit card, $300 on another credit card, $150 to my father for money he let me borrow and about $500 in pending repairs to my old, shitty car that I need to commute to work.

In addition to that, I have a few wild but old credit scenarios involving many facets that basically ended in me refusing to pay and the companies destroying my credit to this day (and for the next 3-4 years minimum) so I can't build credit.  I've reported it to all the credit agencies but to no avail and on that side of things I owe about $3,800 broken into like 6 different things.

I want to pay them off but they're all with collection agencies and it's been so long since I've spoken with them that I've stopped being contacted by them and don't know their names or how to go about paying them.

Because my credit is so bad, I don't qualify for any kind of loans without a 200% or higher interest rate so debt consolidation via loan is not an option really.  Also, I'll be needing a new car or motorcycle to commute in the coming months but I can't get a loan and have no money towards a down payment.  My current car is maybe worth $1,500 on a good day.

That's just about it but one small detail about my monthly income, I just started this job and part of my income is bonus which is on a 60-day delay so I won't be seeing full paychecks until around December and in the meantime I'll be right around $2,400 a month.  I was also just out of a job for 6-weeks and now my first few checks need to go towards things like buying food for my house and general shopping for household items.

I know it's a mess but if anyone can help me out with some input I'd appreciate it.",finance,1445104612
personalfinance,Unexplained drop in credit score. No new account activity.,"Hello personal finance experts.  I hope you can help me figure something out.  I have been working hard to bring my credit and finances in line.  I have a Discover card which displays my credit score on my monthly statement.  Over the course of the past year I’ve watched my credit score go from 694 up to 711.  It has stayed solid at 711 since March and has not moved until now in October.  All of the sudden my credit score dropped down to 686 for no apparent reason.  I have not opened any new credit accounts, no credit inquiries, moved, or done anything that I think would make this sudden change.  


I currently have revolving credit on only three cards:


•	A credit card with an auto repair place.  About two years ago my car needed some major car repairs and some new tires.  Over the course of the years, and other needed repairs and oil changes, I’ve maintained a somewhat low balance on here, less than $300.  I just paid this card off about six weeks ago.

•	A medical care credit card.  This account has been open for a very long time when I needed wisdom teeth pulled.  It has sat at a zero balance for years.  In March my stupid cat hurt himself so I used it to pay for the surgery, they gave me six months no interest. I have also recently paid this off before the outrageous interest rate hit.

•	A Discover card with a balance of a little over $3,000.  They are charging me a very painful interest rate and refuse to lower it.  This is now my main focus to pay off as once this is gone all I have left is student loans (*sobs quietly*) to pay for.


The only thing that has changed for me recently is paying off those two cards.  Would that explain the sudden drop in my score?  I don’t understand why.  If that is the case, it is awful that I am being punished for paying off what I owe instead of being dinged hard by interest rates.  Can I expect my score to go back up?

I haven't paid them yet because they're about 6-7 years old and almost past statute of limitations. Also I've heard that paying them won't necessarily fix my credit. Advice on this is also appreciated.

investing,How will leveraged muni ETFs will behave with interest rate hikes?,"I have a significant portion of my investments locked in leveraged bonds (BBN, BFZ, NAC, NZH, etc). The tax advantaged NAC, BFZ provide about 6% dividend yield while taxable BBN provides close to 8% dividend yield. All these funds have been consistently paying dividends for the past seven to eight years. Since I have a decent paying job and passive real estate investments, I have gotten bold over the past one year and invested almost all of my savings into these  funds so the stakes are really high for me. While I am doing okay for now, I am concerned what will happen when interest rates go up. Since the noise went up about interest rate hike, prices of these ETFs actually went up which seems counter-intuitive to some extent but probably the leveraging is causing the reverse effect. I don't know. Anyway, I have following specific questions.

* What happens to the prices of these funds when Fed raises interest rates? More importantly what happens to the dividend?
* What happens in the long term when Fed continues to raise interest rates over the next couple of years?  Both to the price and dividend.

Note that I don't mind price volatility as long as dividends are consistent and price has the potential to come back to current levels over the next decade or so.",finance,1445110579

personalfinance,(Australia) Looking for help/advice on putting myself into a better financial position. Its a bit long winded.,"Hi Guys, I need advice on ways to hide/invest my income. My current situation is as follows...

My current annual income is around $160,000 - $180,000 PA.I am an Electrician by trade and 25 years in age.

I have a small share portfolio around $14,000 which pays roughly $400 PA in dividends. I try to invest $2000 per year I understand that I have to make 4.87% otherwise its worth more paying off my land.

I also have a 2 properties.

The first one is worth $300,000 with $240,000 owing this is my investment property which is negative geared. Its currently generating $15,200 per year minus deductions.

The second is a 1.2 hectare potion of land worth $180,000 owing $155,000. The purpose is to build a house on it ASAP. To avoid paying rent.


Both interest rates are 4.42%

I'm currently renting the house i'm in and its close to the second property for $375 a week which is $19,500 per year.

I pay the bank a yearly fee of $350 for their services such as a credit card, loan package and account keeping fees.

I currently budget well I think... and all my accounts are 100% Offset so the interest comes of the mortgage for my land. I have 1 credit card ($4000) that I use for everything and pay it off at 50 days of my credit cycle.
 I have two cars ones worth around $22,000 and the second is a ""work"" car due to my location the risk of hitting animals is high and its around 150K travel per day and its only worth $2000

My questions are....

1. Is it better to try and set up a trust with the share portfolio or try and/or link it with an ABN to avoid taxes? By which I mean as an investment company? Which might allow more deductions?

2. Is it better to take the investment property up to 95% of value to free up some funds to start the construction on the second? To avoid paying ""dead"" money

3. The cost of running two cars worth it?

4. The $350 fee from the bank goes onto my mortgage for the land because I bought the land after the investment (long story) is the a way I can transfer it to the Investment (2nd) mortgage? Or even claim the fee as a deduction on my tax?

5. I'm also thinking about applying for an ABN as I mess around with PC's and networking as a side project/hobby. Is this a good idea to try and hide some of my PAYG main income?

The wife and I ( both under 30 ) have both just been given 18% raises and we've been thinking it's about time we get serious about buying our first home in the next 12 months. We've done a bit of window shopping and a few model home tours and it seems that $300,000 is about what it will take to get something we're really happy with in our area ( Baltimore County, Maryland ). We're both pretty lousy with finances in general so we're hoping someone with better sense for this kind of stuff can tell us if we're crazy for thinking 300K is comfortably within our affordability range.

**Gross Income:** 110K ( Me 84K her 26K )

**Monthly Take Home:** Roughly 6K after insurance, taxes, 10% 401K etc

**Savings:** Roughly 22K ( hoping to leave 5 digits for rainy day after down payment )

**Current Monthly Expenses**

* Rent: $1325
* Phone: $150
* TV/Internet: $100
* Gas/Electric: $125
* Water: $35
* Car Payment: $390
* Web Hosting: $20
* Misc Subscriptions: $20
* Auto Insurance: $115
* Renters Insurance: $25

**Total:** $2305

Other spending varies wildly but if Mint can be believed the only net negative month we've had all year was when we booked our vacation. Keep in mind the 18% raises only kick in this month. Also - this helps - no kids. My income is very stable and secure - hers not as much.

My super stupid rough math puts a $300,000 house at about $1700-1800 monthly after a 20K down payment ( including taxes and insurance ). This seems reasonable on our income but I feel like I'm probably miscalculating or forgetting some important line item. For example I honestly have no idea how much money is involved in the actual shopping process ( inspections, closing, realtor costs, etc ). I've also heard you can pay off PMI early but have no idea how to calculate the cost of this.

Can anyone lend a hand? :-(

**Edit:** If it changes anything know that MD has stupid expensive housing in general and 300K is actually below the average especially for the nicer suburbs near Baltimore.

**Another Edit:** Thank you everyone for your responses. This got wayyyy more attention than I had expected! The overall consensus seems to be that, while we can afford the monthly costs there are a lot of upfront costs we had not considered that would potentially wipe our our savings. I think we're going to continue renting for at least another 6-12 months and save as much as we can while keeping our eyes peeled for homes similar to what we've been looking at but in the 250K or below range. Will also be keeping track of the average interest rates as I'm told we're at an all time low right now - will consider speeding up our timeline if we see it rising too much.

I was originally planning on paying about $1k/month on student debt and investing about $500-750 but since it seems like my interest is so low I've now considered investing $1k-1.5k a month and paying much lower on my student loans. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of those strategies?

TLDR: Invest money aggressively and pay student loans slowly, or pay student loans aggressively and invest slowly.

PS: I have no car payment, and my only month2month expenses are about $700 in CC debt and standard living bills. My starting salary range is $20-$30/hr with built in overtime. I've heard starting wage is usually $30, but I always plan conservatively.

personalfinance,Settlement options?,"Okay I'll keep this short and sweet. I graduated from college in 09. Through a series of events and me being stupid and young my loans with Sallie Mae defaulted and federal came close. The feds have worked with me on Inome based and they are all current. Sallie Mae at the time however stated they couldn't do anything bc they don't offer them so now I'm in collections and have been. I recently got a new job that's pays decent and I have a second one as part time police officer as I'm pursuing full time law enforcement options. So my question goes should I settle for 12k to 13k which they offered before on my original 46k debt? Or should I setup payment plans?

personalfinance,How should I handle my student and car loans while having a lump sum sitting?,"Hey pf! I've got a few questions hopefully you can help me out. First I'll start with the details. I've recently finished college and I'm making about 45k as of now. Most of the people I graduated with do not have relevant jobs, and my job could go either way really, but it looks as though it will be a semi permanent job. This may change quickly, but I'd like to base everything on this. Even if this job does not hold through, I've always been able to land another job, even if it's construction or something. I work very hard and finding another job isn't a very big issue. I've also about 38k in the bank as an inheritance from about 8 years ago. Now I drive an old broken down vehicle that is going to need some work coming up soon that just isn't worth it to fix right now. Last year my car got stolen so I thought I'd buy a beater to get me through the year until I was done school and working. 

I'll start with the student loan. I'm to begin paying it back now. The payments they set up for me is $210 a month. This will take 114 months to pay off which will cost me about 5k in interest. My idea for these loans was to pay this basic amount and deposit lump sums as I see fit and I can save. I feel it is better to have my cushion as a safety net in case I lose my job or work becomes scarce (I work In the oil/gas and mining exploration industry.. It was lucrative when I began, I swear). 

I know interest is going to cost me, but is it worth it to keep the safety net? 

My next question is about the car. I'm looking to buy something newer. Not brand new, but newer. I've had vehicles pushing 175+k km all my life and they've needed lots of repairs. I have a few options in mind (I've done research on reliability and whatnot to find what's best for me) and I was thinking of spending 15-20k. I've got a meeting on Wednesday with the bank to open a tfsa account and to discuss a car loan. I've got phenomenal credit and I'm thinking hopefully a low interest rate (about 3%?).

personalfinance,Began loan repayment-- doesn't feel good,"My story:

I graduated this year with a masters of science, and began my job on the day I submitted my final thesis. Even though my loans don't begin repayment until February, I've read up about the value of being as aggressive as possible through you guys, and I submitted my first payment today.

I owe $128,614.45 with a range of interest rates, all taken through federal student loans.  I make $47,860.90 a year before tax.

personalfinance,College tuition trouble...,"Im running into some serious problems my first year off college.
Basically, this is my first year of college. First semester/Quarter. My parents got divorced literally RIGHT before i left for college and it was a fairly nasty one.

I dont want to talk to much about my parents troubles, but my relationship with my mother has deteriorated to the point where its non existent and my dad has been shackled with a ton of debt.


Orginally - i was coming into college with zero student loans. My family said they could afford to send me without getting loans, and considering how at the time I didnt want to be in debt this worked our perfectly. 

Well now in the not so distant future.....It doesnt sound like my dad can afford the next Quarter. We talked about it and hes struggling right now so we discussed the option of me getting student loans to continue going to school which of course I agreed to. So i started doing research on the subject.....I missed the deadline for applying for Federal student loans through FAFSA, and State Student Loans I can still make the deadline(jan 1st) but I dont think that will help me because I was hoping to get the loans now So i dont have to drop out after my first quarter....

Am I out of options? Ive been looking at PELL grants but again I dont think this can help me out in the short term. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

If I have to I seriously dont mind dropping out and working a job while going to community college for a few years or something. And im guessing thats what im going to have to do at this point.
Anyways any advice and tips would be greatly appreciated...

personalfinance,"Parents keep telling me not to pay off car loans, student loans early its stupid. Internet wisdom and Financial Guru's says to pay off loans ASAP? Who's right and why?","My parents are like the classic stereotype of baby boomers. Spend spend spend, mortgage, loans and keep spending. Jobs were better back then but growing up they constantly had to have new cars and larger and larger homes. Lavish vacations, new clothes, cable with 1500 channels that no one watches. Going out to eat all the time. The end result? They are still working well past retirement age to be able to keep doing this lifestyle. 

I am pretty close to them and share a lot of my stuff to get advice. They were pretty successful as far as material items and going out and doing stuff. 

I've been subscribed to the Early Retirement theory since college. But it seems like most of the material is written for people who make 6 figure incomes as programers at Amazon or Google. You know like figure out how to live on $20,000 a year and take the rest of your $100,000 a year income and put it into index funds, drive a beat up old car that gets good MPG, never go out to eat, buy stuff at the thrift store or free on craigslist. Retire in less than 10 years. 

I could do that except I don't make six figures, not even close. For me its closer to retire in 30-40 years even with those cut backs. Add in an insane amount of student loans for what turned out to be a useless college degree and it feels like it won't ever happen.


So my parents argue that I wouldn't be able to enjoy life with out ultra excess materialism that they do. I guess you can tell by the way I worded that I don't agree with them. But its a constant issue thats constantly talked about every time I spend time with them. 

Latest example, I bought a high mileage  4x4 pick up truck for under $10K I financed the loan at a low interest rate (3%). I was planning to pay the entire thing off in less than a year so I wouldn't have to worry about the payment and then it would just be payed off. The truck was so cheap that I figured it wouldn't take that long to pay off. I was talking to my dad about it and he started criticizing me about wanting to pay it off quickly. First he didn't like the idea that I bought a used truck, but his advice was to just pay the minimum payment for the life of the loan since it was so cheap. I have gap insurance if it goes underwater in the case of an accident, which its probably underwater the second I drove it off the lot. But.. Its a similar argument with how I live my life.

Parents advice:
Student loans, why pay that off early, drag it out to the end with the payment. Car loans, pay the minimum, keep financing everything. Get a house with a mortgage and don't try to pay it off early, theres no point. 

According to them all that money saved by not paying things off early can go to other things. It makes life to uncomfortable to try to pay things off and there is absolutely not point in doing it. They say my life will suck to much and I am being irrational about wanting to pay things off. 


But listen to Dave Ramsey, Mr. Money Mustache and every other financial Guru, they all say, pay cash for things (something my parents are against) and pay off loans ASAP. 

The thing is I've seen my parents live really good lifes, with lots of nice things. According to them I'll miss out on having a ""life"" by being so frugal. They thought it was stupid.

I suspect I am not the only millennial that feels this way, and have put off significant purchases due to this debt (Never bought new TV or furniture, but wait till friends upgrade for cheaper). For the last year or so, I have been paying an extra $90.00 toward paying down my student loans, but I am worried that this money may be better allocated by going toward a retirement account such as a Roth IRA. I have also tried to refinance my student loans, but I have either been denied (DRB) or have not received enough of a cut in interest rate (.5% lower) to warrant going through with the application (SOFI).  
I currently have an employment based retirement, and I have about 30k in that account. I do not have retirement accounts other than my current employee based retirement account. My employer based account does not allow me to contribute more to it.    

Summary of Student Loans:
1. Started with 48k in student loans in 2008 @ 5.875 APR
2. Now student loans total about $35,600
3. Payment is $300.00 every month, on some type of 22 year payment plan (happened during loan consolidation, no idea why it changed from 10 year standard) + Extra $90.00 toward principal every month. 

Summary of Current Retirement Accounts (Age = 32): 
1.	Employee based retirement account at 30k
2.	No other retirement account, but thinking of paying $90.00 a month toward retirement would be more beneficial than paying down student loans.

* 5 month (May - Sept) average monthly bring home (myself and wife after taxes and insurance): $6,100(me $3,400; wife $2,700)

-my salary 53k/year; wife $16/hr with at least 40 hr/week

-good job security, we expect this salary to be relatively constant or go up a bit

-we are both in our first year of our careers, so our incomes should definitely go up overtime

-zero credit card debt (thanks PF!), we each have a Citi 2% Cashback card that we pass all expenditures through possible

-overall, have about 30K credit in credit cards (I think its good to have this in case of a financial disaster of epic proportions)

-We both hang around 750-760 credit score (FICO)


**Financial Goals:** fund EF, pay off high interest student loans, buy house (in that order)

**Personal goals:** Have a kid or two! (we're excited about this part)



* Rent ($1250/mo)
* Phone ($106.98/mo); $81.98 for 2 phones + $25/mo for phone replacement
* Electric/gas utilities ($250/mo)
* Renters Insurance ($37.28/mo)
* Water/Trash/Sewer ($105/mo)
* Groceries/Household Goods ($600/mo); includes groceries, cleaning items, bathroom stuff, etc. this is one of the biggest thorns in my side. Seems like a lot but cannot seem to get it lower.
* Fuel ($220/mo); wife has about a 25 mile commute, me 6 miles
* Medical/Health ($100/mo); we have medical, dental, and vision insurance, so this is for copays/deductibles and exercise related expenses
* Clothing/shoes ($50/mo); maybe a little on the low side, but we use cash back from Citi 2% card to supplement this since all but rent and student loans are ""run through""  our cards
* Dogs ($50/mo); 2 dogs: includes food and vet. One is 3 yo 10 pounds, other is ~7 yo 15 pounds
* Membership Dues/Certification fees ($15/mo); pays for professional memberships and certifications needed for our jobs
* Cable TV/Internet ($125/mo); Comcast (only option here), 105 mbps ~~up~~down, 50 mbps ~~down~~up, plus basic cable (non-HD)
* Netflix ($8.65/mo)
* Vaping/Smoking ($100/mo); recently quit smoking using vaping, will eventually quit vaping
* Spending Money ($200/mo); whatever the heck we want to spend it on
* Restaurants ($200/mo); always a struggle to stay under, even though we don't usually eat out for lunch
* Car Maint./Registration ($100/mo); two vehicles paid off. Inlcudes about $600/year registration plus any other routine maintenance. Both vehicles 2007 and each has about 100k miles. Wife's will easily last another 100,000, mine hopefully 50 - 75k
* Car Insurance ($70/mo); about $800/year
* Emergency Fund (currently $12.3K,funding $1750/mo); goal is around 20K
* Gifts ($75/mo)
* Vacation ($250/mo); we feel like we gotta live a little


**Student Loan Payment ($403.94/mo)**; all loans are U.S. federal (no private loans)

- $5477.21, 3.15%

- $5570.07, 3.15%

- $8216.26, 6.55%

- $5582.60, 3.61%

- $7413.16, 3.61%

- $2410.21, 4.41%

- $1825.40, 4.41%

Total = $36,600

Total, greater than 4% = $12,500

Me ($200/mo, 10 year term)

- 17,045.24, 5.16%

Grand total: $53,650

Grand total, greater than 4%: 29,600

**Plan of attack:** save up 20K for EF (currently 12.3K, funding at $1750/mo), then attack loans greater than 4% by diverting the 1750/mo for EF to loans, then save 60K for home (down payment, closing costs, paint, extra EF, etc.)


**Questions:**

* How does the budget look?

* Missing anything?

* Need anymore info?


* If we can keep saving at current rate (1.75k/mo), our current goals cost 6.7k (complete EF) + 29.6k (loans &gt;4%), + 60k = 96.3K and will take around 56 months (4 years and 7 months, though more likely to 5-6 years  assuming some emergency setbacks over that amount of time)

-the question is, how much is a kid or two going cost us? Can we really afford it? Are we going to have to sacrifice some of our financial goals or be okay with them taking much longer?

personalfinance,[22] M - I was uncertain about my future. I met a guy that is willing to educate me on Enterprise Risk Management for a fee. Is it too risky?,"Hi everyone,    
    
Please excuse me for my formatting, this is the first time I've ever posted on Reddit.    
    
**About Me**    

I am currently a senior at a university studying Economics. I have an average GPA and I've been struggling to figure out what I've wanted to do post-college. I've been spending the last four years working a variety of jobs to help pay for housing and college.    
Fortunately, I only have about $8,000 in loans. I have managed to save $3,000 for any emergencies and I have enough money to pay for Rent and food until my graduation in May. For my senior year, I really wanted to focus on school and networking with my peers. That means I am not working for an entire year, so my budget is currently tight.    
    
**The Dilemma**    
I have spent a lot of time researching careers, and I have found interest in becoming an Actuary. I was planning on graduating, moving back home and studying for two of the actuarial exams, then working. My school does not offer a program for actuarial science, so I've taken as many probability courses as possible.    
At an open house for Economics major, I met a man that runs a tutoring company. I discussed my potential plans with him and he told me he could help me get my foot into the Enterprise Risk Management field. He was an actuary for 10 years or so, then he started to work in a bank and other places. He has a lot of real world experiences that he was willing to teach me. Here are a few examples:    
   
* Statistical and Structured Finance    

* CRM Data Mining    

* Risk Based Reserving    

* Basel II, III     

* DFAST and CCAR banking    

* Reinsurance and Captive/Cell Corporations    
   
and a lot more! It sounds like such an amazing opportunity. He is charging $22,000 for the entire course over a 6 month span. He promised there would be hands on work from the companies he used to work for, and he also guaranteed my money back if I didn't land a $90,000 job right after completing the course.    

&amp;nbsp;

We were able to negotiate the price to $6,000 now and I pay him the rest back later. It all seems like a great opportunity with a lot of knowledge that takes years to acquire. I would have to take out a loan with my bank at a 3.7% interest rate/year.   
&amp;nbsp;

What I am asking is whether I should go with this new path, or stick to my original plan. It seems too good to be true honestly, but it would be really good for me and my family.
    

Any advice or guidance would be terrific. Thank you.

We are putting money on her student loans ($500, $3000) and our tractor supply credit card ($280) and her car.  Once those are all done we will making our way back to the student loan.  

So the plan is pretty sound but what I am really curious about are companies like Sofi that offer Student loan consolidation.  Do these type of companies do private loans?  Sallie Mae is hitting me with 11% interest with a balance of $30000 so anything to help there would make me feel better.",finance,1445216910

personalfinance,Leasing a BMW i3 rex or any EV,"Hello R/PF So I'm in the process of leasing a Bmw i3 Rex and I am a little confused on some stuff.
First what brought me in to look at the Rex was Bmw's lease offer of 269.00 a month with 4,192.00 due at signing. Now I read it and it does state that tax, title, license not included. I tried doing the math and based on 24 months payment it was like 600.00 added to the total cost.
The big thing is that the sales manager at Bmw of Bellevue wa is saying that there is 1500 dollars missing from the total and one being that the 7500 federal rebate is taxed. I am no math wiz and not the brightest tool but paying tax on a tax rebate sounds weird.
The other thing is trying to get them to lower the MSRP of the Rex based off of kbb and truecar.com has been tough.
Anyone have any tips or suggestions? And is the federal tax on tax a real thing or just a neat trick to bump their profits.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated as this is my first lease and electric car for that matter.

(x-post r/StudentLoans)","24 years old. This is my second time in undergrad. I saved and paid my way through the first time and finished with 0 debt. Problem was I got a useless religion degree. Was a part time teacher for a couple years and was going nowhere in life. Went back to school for CS on federal loans with the idea that I would get a part time job to help with expenses. The numbers all worked out assuming I could get a job, except I was so late registering for classes that I wasn't able to pick my schedule, and the schedule I got was completely unattractive to every employer I've met with (I'm basically on campus all day). Now I'm several months into school and don't have any way of paying rent at the end of this month. I've taken out the max amount from federal loans and am virtually ineligible for most scholarships because of my age/the fact that I've already completed a degree.

I am in serious desperation mode and need a solution that can see me through at least this semester so that I can try again at getting a job next semester when my schedule is hopefully better. I have about 50 bucks in my checking account right now and about 100 bucks on my credit card (25 dollar minimum payment at the end of the month). Rent is 350, utilities average about 80. I'm already not paying my shitty obamacare payments, but I owe money on that. Parents are worse off than I am. I have really good credit and live very cheaply, I just have no income at all.

I believe opening up a Roth IRA through fidelity for the max amount ($5,500) for this year would be the next step?

I don't feel i'll be loosing my job anytime soon, so I believe it make sense just to leave $30,000 in my savings account as an emergency fund.

I believe the final step I need to figure out is how to and how much I should invest in index funds and bonds. Going off the wiki I should be looking at 75% in index funds and 25% in bonds. It looks like fidelity is a reasonable way to purchase index funds and bonds. Now are there certain index funds and bonds I should be looking at based off if I don't plan on needing the money for say the next 10 years or more? Would it be worth while to sit down with PNC investments or should I just I just try to do it all through fidelity? What should I watch out for if I did sit down with PNC investments?

Ultimately, I sold several tens of thousands of dollars of stock to purchase a home in June of this year. The total long-term capital gains is approximately $15,000, and a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that this is a long-term capital gains tax of $2250 (15%).

personalfinance,I'm a 23M that is thinking about co-financing a house with my dad.,"As the title says, I'm looking to finance a house with my dad (and girlfriend). My dad is well-off and has extra money that he's looking to invest, and with the lease on my apartment ending soon, approached me with the idea of co-financing a house with him. I'm not worried about my girlfriend being in the picture, we've been dating 6 years and plan on getting married in June. 

I have about $10,000 saved up and work a job where I make $18-$25/hr (varies). My gf has more money saved up ($20,000?) and would be putting in money as well. My dad hasn't purchased property besides the 2 houses he's owned and lived in himself, so we're both kind of going into this as beginners. He wants to help by putting a lump sum down for the down payment, and also money into the house for repairs/additional work to improve value while my gf and I pay the monthly mortgage. When it comes time to sell the house, we plan on splitting the profits between everyone based on how much money each party put into the property.

Here are the questions I have:

1). How should we determine how much profit each party gets? Ex. my dad puts down $50,000 on the down payment, and I put down $50,000 in monthly mortgage over a year, would we each have an equal stake in the property? Even though my payments mostly go to interest while his goes right to the principal?

2). I have a good but short credit history, my dad's is amazing. When we cosign does my worse credit affect the interest rates on the mortgage? Or would his override mine?

3). Can my dad get tax write-offs for this second property if he pays the mortgage and I just give him cash? Or does he have to be primary resident?

4). Does anyone have any good resources to suggest for me to go through for someone trying to invest in property with someone else?

5). Thoughts on realtors? My dad seemed to think going without a realtor could be risky but payoff. He also seems to be ok with me choosing the property, but I wouldn't know where to start looking, besides what part of town to look in. Any good websites to find property for sale?

personalfinance,Buying a car: 2016 Volt w/ tax credit vs. 2012 Volt w/o tax credit,"Hey, PF!  I'm looking to buy a new (to me) car early to middle of next year.  My daily commute is only ~10mi round trip, so I was looking into a used Volt.  My dad owns one and I love the thing, plus I can guarantee the vast majority of my driving will be done on electric power.  I was looking at some 2012s with low mileage (~$15k with the options I'd want currently), but my dad was encouraging me to consider the new 2016s (~$35k with the options I'd want) because of the redesign and upgrades to the electric and hybrid engines.  Just for the record, I know I can afford either car without compromising savings/retirement/general financial security.  

My initial thought is that the math doesn't work out buying new, but he seems convinced it's a better deal.  With PF being so against buying new, I figure if y'all agree with him, it must be true.  Here are the relevant differences as I see them:

1. 2016 has 53 miles of electric range vs. ~23 for the 2012.
2. 2016 is eligible for the $7500 federal tax credit while the 2012 likely isn't (although I've seen some dealers claim they still are, perhaps because that particular vehicle was a lease and it was never claimed?).  There are no state incentives that I'm aware of in Texas.
3. The 2016 gets 41mpg in ""hybrid mode"" vs. 38mpg for the 2012.  I do drive to visit my folks (~100 miles one way) occasionally and travel to the Rio Grande Valley (~350 miles one way) for work maybe every other month so this does matter slightly.
4. For the 2012, I'd need to finance ~$5k of the cost at most after selling my current car.  For the 2016, I'd need to finance $25k.  My dad recommended I throw the $7500 from the tax credit at the car after I get it back and refi, but I have excellent credit so my interest rate would likely be low. As a result, I'd think throwing it in my 401k or Roth IRA would be better, but I'm open to suggestions about the best use of the rebate if I do buy new.
5. When the 2016 comes out (first major redesign), I imagine the 2012 will drop in price even more reducing the amount I'd need to finance (if I'd need to finance at all).

I guess the ultimate question is this: Does the tax credit + investment opportunity offset the depreciation of the 2016?",finance,1445266739

personalfinance,Question about paying off Loans with similar interest rate but drastic difference in principal.,"I apologize in advance if I missed any formatting requirements.

Hello, I am a recent college graduate in the US and getting ready to pay off loans as the grace period is about to end. From reading the FAQ's in the subreddit, it seems the ""Avalanche"" method had been stated that one will be paying the least amount of money overall when paying off debt. Let me start my question with an actual instance:

I have 4 loans that I am looking to payoff asap:

Loan A: Principal $12,000 Interest 6.3%

Loan B: Principal $3,000 Interest 6.7%

Loan C: Principal $2,000 Interest 6.7%

Loan D: Principal $3,000 Interest 6.7%

(These loans information are close estimates.)

I want to pay off either a majority of Loan A, or use that same amount of money to pay of Loan B, C, and D. My question is, does the avalanche method still apply in this case to pay the least amount of money possible overall? 

My assumption was that, though Loans B-D have slightly higher interest rate, because Loan A has higher principal, it'd be more money saving to pay off majority of Loan A to reduce the overall interest being accrued. This seems like a math problem, but I'd appreciate if someone could confirm or disprove my assumption. Thank you.

gaming,Steam Machines and their purpose in gaming,"Steam Machines seem to be getting a lot of hate lately and they aren't even officially out yet. This post's purpose is to show Steam Machines capabilities, benefits, clear up some misconceptions about the SteamOS/Linux platform. **This is NOT a post saying that Steam Machines will/won't be successful**.

As a quick background about me. I've been a gamer my entire life enjoying every manner of console and PC gaming. The only console families I've never owned are XBox and Sega (played plenty of XBox though with friends).

**So, what exactly is the purpose of Steam Machines?**

The goal Valve has with Steam Machines is to provide a Console-like Living room experience with PC gaming that requires little to no Computer knowledge to get into the game. They also have a goal of getting games NOT designed with controllers in mind to work with a controller (Hence the strange controller design). Steam Machines also provide a ""buy once, play anywhere"" model to those with a Steam Machine console and one (or more) Windows/Mac/Linux PCs... This is **GOOD** for consumers and may (hopefully) start cutting into MS, Nintendo, and Sony's repeated requirements to ""rebuy"" classic games on newer consoles, allowing for players to get the latest ""steam machine"" without losing their library of games.

**Why a Linux-Based OS?**

There are actually multiple reasons for this. Valve didn't need to go with a Linux-Based OS, they could have gone with a UNIX-based OS like Sony did with the PS4. The actual specifics are irrelavant.

1. Linux-based OSes (and some UNIX-based like FreeBSD) have open source code bases. This allows vendors to take those OSes and use/modify them for their purposes. This allows Valve to create a Linux-Based OS with pre-installed drivers, software, and tools all designed to work together for a singular purpose. This is exactly what Sony did with the PS4's Orbis OS - which is based off the open source FreeBSD UNIX-based OS. What Valve is doing is not new.
2. Valve's (and other PC game vendors) are genuinely fearful of one day being restricted behind the Windows Store and because of that, using something not microsoft based allows them to continue supporting the Steam ecosystem across their supported platforms (Win/Mac/Linux), but also retain the ability to break away from Windows one day if they need to.
3. Relying on another vendor's OS when building what is essentially a console ties you to that vendor's goals. This becomes even more problematic if that Vendor (such as MS Windows) also has their own play in the console market.
4. The Steam Machine MUST be treated like a new console. As such, it is important to note that more AAA games will take time to get. Just like the new release of XBox, PS, or Nintendo - 3rd Party devs will wait and see. Valve is playing the **Long Game** with this and they can afford to. With over 125 million users (1.25 mil Linux, 3.75 mil Mac, and tons Windows).

**Game/Driver Support**

Driver support in Linux has not been an issue in most places except one: Graphics. This began to change when Valve started the Steam Universe/Steam Machines initiative. Valve, as one of the largest game distributors, carries a lot of weight in the gaming industry and since then Intel and NVidia driver quality has greatly improved. AMD has fallen behind a bit, probably due to the fact that they already get a decent amount of money from the console business (all 3 major consoles use AMD rather than Intel/Nvidia) and that they are putting more effort into the Vulkan API drivers at this time than maintaining current OpenGL drivers. As a side note, Sony and Nintendo had to go through the same issues with drivers regarding their Console OSes and the Hardware.... main difference is that they did the work behind closed doors... Valve's is out in the open AND it benefits Linux Desktop users as well.

As for Game support... well that's complicated. As someone who's work with Developers in the past (both good and bad ones) I can tell you that there is a large portion of Developers that are just simply lazy.... they don't care about the OS/Hardware they are writing for and just write a program to run without little thought to how it affects the system it is run on. With Consoles many developers get tools that do a LOT of work for them. In a hurry to get a game out for all platforms, many developers expect to be able to create their game, then click a button for each platform. **This** is why many PC games, even on Windows, have significant bugs compared to the console version - the game was built for consoles with the expectation that it would work everywhere. The same problem has been carried over to the newer Linux platform.... Devs expect it to work like Windows, but it's not the same. If you look at the good ports to linux (Valve games, Borderlands, Civ5, etc) the difference between them and the ""bad"" ports comes down to Dev laziness in most cases (and in others - they took the time to fix the port).

**Final section - Linux Misconceptions**

This final section is to address some common Linux misconceptions or expectations that have pervaded the media and community for a long time:

1. **""Linux Driver support is horrible""** - this is completely false. Most common hardware is built into the Linux kernel nowadays (meaning no install required). From Touchpads to Wireless mice to printers to the XPad driver for XBox and Logitech controllers. Almost all are included in the kernel by default and those that aren't are in easy to find locations in the Update Repos. Where you run into issues are new/non-standard hardware. This is why installing Linux on a Macbook is a pain - some of the hardware is apple specific with no drivers for other OSes (Bootcamp provides those for Windows). In fact, up until Windows 10, getting a fully functional Linux Desktop was much faster than a fully functional Windows Desktop.
2. **""Linux Desktop is not user friendly""** - This is entirely based off one concept.... that ALL desktops must function like Windows. If you choose to use a Linux desktop you MUST realize that a Linux OS is NOT Windows and won't function like Windows. In fact, Linux OSes have more in common with Mac OS X than Windows.
3. **""Require Command Line knowledge""** - This is no longer the case. Especially with Operating Systems like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS, ChromeOS, and Korora. These Desktops are designed for ease of use and have even added GUI programs for access into the software repos. Ubuntu Software Center and GNOME Software are leading the charge on the Linux side. Think App Store without the Account requirement.
4. **""No one uses Linux desktop""** - This one is very difficult to quantify as most of those user percentages are still based off the pre-installed OS not what is used on a daily basis. ANY Desktop or Laptop sold with Windows that has had Windows replaced with Ubuntu/Fedora/Arch will still show as a Windows user since it was sold with Windows. Much like the Nielsen ratings used to ONLY be based off live tv and streaming wasn't accounted for, the current userbase system is also skewed.

Final note: I am in NO WAY saying that Linux is better than Windows, Mac, or Console overall. In fact, they all require each other to provide incentive to innovate and improve. I do find it interesting that Gaming is the ONLY Technology based field where innovation is looked at with disgust rather than embraced. I personally think that if Steam Machines ARE successful, they wouldn't make Desktop gaming or console gaming obsolete, but rather it would compliment the market and force MS and Sony to start thinking outside of the box. Competition is GOOD for consumers since it helps ensure we as gamers are always getting the best quality product, something I think is disappearing in the gaming world as more and more companies are creating more sequels and less originals.

My first goals after graduating college were to first pay off my student loans and then establish an emergency fund. Both of these have been accomplished. 

I had taken out a total of $26K in student loans, paid some off during school, graduated with $17k left and paid that off last May. 

I currently have $10k in an emergency fund (this is just a regular savings account right now, I should move it to something with a higher interest rate probably). I currently have $3000 in my checking account and a credit score of around 760. 

I think that my budget is pretty decent. It has me saving around $1200 which is accurate. Some months are a little less due to travel (family in Boston, occasional road trips) or Holidays but it’s only in these kind of circumstances that I go over. 

I guess my question really is, where could I do better and what should I do next? 

I was aggressively saving to accomplish the student loans and E-fund goal, now that I’ve got those in the bag, I am lost as to what to do now. I can see maybe paying off the car, someday (maybe in like 5 years?) buying a house, and doing more to fund retirement but I don’t know which of those to prioritize or how exactly to go about it.

I am thinking of opening an Ally Bank savings account with the one percent interest rate. So , this would be about $28 a year .

Also, there is no fees to do the basics, such as ACH transfers to and from my bank (up to 6 withdraws according to regulations.) I don't plan on withdrawing much.

As it stands right now - I've got ~4k in CC debt across 3 different cards and owe $6500 on my car. One of my cards has a 20% deferred interest rate - so I've managed to not pay any interest on my purchases thus far - however, would I be better off selling my stock on purchase date and making 15% - putting all of that towards paying of CC debt? Or should I keep it in stock and continue paying debt out of my regular income?

Thanks in advance.

Anyway, this year, I got right on applying for the aid I received last year, having learned from my past mistake. So far, most of it (from the college, federal loans and grants, etc.) has come through. However, the biggest grant, the TAG, and a private scholarship haven't shown on my bill. I had to show the college the welcome letter for the scholarship to get it on my record as pending, avoid late fees and de-registration, and transfer some funds to a college debit card so I could purchase my course materials.

The office handling the TAG told me it would be 7-8 weeks (much of which should be over) before my application will be done being state verified. I have no idea why it would take so long when last year went much, much faster and I wasn't nearly as persistent. The private scholarship has been confirmed and put as pending, but when I asked why the funds haven't been received, my contact with them tells me they simply haven't been able to reach their contact with the college.

I'm already concerned that I may not receive this financial aid or that it will take even longer than I imagine. Is there anything I can do? Or is this normal for financial aid?",finance,1445285024

When I was hired, another person was hired along with me for the same position. We both had the same amount of experience prior to then, and we went through the exact same training process before becoming trainers ourselves. We work at the same location, teach the same classes, and in general have shared the exact same experiences of working at this facility. We also get paid the same amount, work the same number of hours, and have in general contributed the same amount of effort and ideas to the job. 

This training facility promised us a review and raise after 3 months, and it has been 6 without either due to a number of managers coming and going. We know we are being underpaid, and frankly we could definitely find better paying and more professional training jobs elsewhere, but we like it here. So my question for you all is, do you think it's okay for us to ask for a raise together? We were planning on calling the boss (you never see him in person) and asking together, because there's really no reason why only one of us should get a raise. Also I would almost feel more weird saying it separately since it would be obvious we were planning it together and we each deserve it as much as the other. Is there any reason you can think of that we shouldn't do it? I know it's probably a little unorthodox, but we can't really imagine doing it separately considering they usually address us together for most tasks. Thanks for any input.

I thought that if you borrow money you get a fix interest rate which you pay for the loan. This can't cause things like these, can it?


If you borrowed that money for a fix interest rate you can't possibly have to pay back that much. How is this possible?

personalfinance,What to do?! Help with student loan planning,"Okay so I just began my second (and final) year at a grad program that is costing me $20,500 a year. Last year I financed my tuition exclusively with a Direct Unsubsidized student loan with an interest rate of 6.8%. I began working as a waitress halfway through the year and because my finances are low I was able to put 6k towards that loan, leaving me with a balance of $14,000 for the 2014-2015 academic year.

Because these loans are issued in installments, I have the option of going to my school in a few months and offering to pay for the next quarter out of pocket. This would decrease the amount of the loan for the 2015-2016 academic year, which has an interest rate of 5.84%. I make about $2,000/month waitressing and almost all this money I could save and pay for my school this year out of pocket. Should I choose this option or pay off as much as I can from the first loan from last year, while accumulating another loan with a lesser interest rate for this year?

personalfinance,Refinancing my home mortgage - is it wise to get appraisals for multiple lenders?,"**Background**

I bought a foreclosed house in the Portland Oregon area a couple years ago w/ a conventional mortgage that only required 3% down. This necessitated a higher interest rate and a pretty crazy PMI payment, this normally would have made me uneasy but I got a great deal on the property (the appraisal came in well over my offer) and the market seemed like it was ready to go up significantly (which it has). At the time I figured that I would be able to hit the 20% equity watermark in 2-4 years from some combination of sweat equity, the market in my area, and aggressive saving/future raises. My plan had always been to at least remove the PMI and possibly refinance, depending on rates.

Well, here I am a couple years later. Equity is rising, rates are still better than what I'm currently paying, I've put a lot of work into the house, but sadly the raises haven't been as good as I'd have liked. This year the county appraiser taxed me based on a value that would give me nearly 82% LTV based on my existing balance (which I use as a low bar) and eyeballing what I feel to be recent comp sales in the area would put me closer to 70-75%. I am a little concerned about how an appraisal is going to come back, it really needs to come in at 4-5% over what the county thinks (dollar value) in order for me to be comfortable after refinancing fees, prepaids, etc.

**Today**

I have been soliciting Loan Estimates (which I like a *lot* better than the GFEs I dealt with last time) from a few internet-based lenders and, after a few days of pitting these offers against against each other, started the application with the lender #1 who held the winning (lowest cost) offer at the time.

Lender #1 told me that they had scheduled an appraisal for that week but there was some mixup with the dates which pushed it back further, based on my discussion with the appointed appraiser this seems pretty fishy and I suspect that this was intentional. Meanwhile, Lender #2 has fired back with a slightly better offer which I intend to pursue instead.

**The question (and tl;dr)**

On the table I have very attractive-looking offers from two lenders, Lender #1 seems to be intentionally dragging their heels a bit and I'm going to go with Lender #2. Is it wise to follow through with (and pay for) the appraisal with Lender #1 in addition to the appraisal required by Lender #2, both for the 2nd opinion and to keep my options open?",finance,1445297875

I run monthly balances on two credit cards between $300-$500 but pay them off each month. I've never carried a balance in the four years I've had a credit card. I have a Very Good credit score but little history in my credit.

I would like to transfer all my high interested cards to it, so about 11,000 (interest on most are 20-22%).

About 10 years ago I received a financial settlement to the tune of about $150K from an IP lawsuit. With the funds I received I paid off debts, made some successful investments in the market (tech), and some unsuccessful ones (mil/industrial), bought a car (used). I also invested in myself with further education, travel, and some passion projects related to my career.

As a freelancer with a good resume and solid work ethic, but not very adept at financial matters, the monies were a blessing and a curse. Because of the safety net, I did not have to work too hard parts of the last decade. I also spent a lot of time out of the US, in my absence a lot of stuff Stateside was not handled correctly. Mea culpa. I wasn't lazy as I achieved a lot, improved my skill set and education, travelled the world and had some decent successes – but the successes were more resume points than financial.

Flash forward 10 years:

One of the ""passion projects"" turned into an expensive debacle that wiped out about half of the funds. Live and learn, follow your bliss?…. yeah whatever. Anyway, I made a bit of a mess and although I have left this late, I'm trying to take responsibility and would love any insights PF has to offer.

Currently the situation is as follows:

I have $18,000 in a Roth Ira.
I owe ± $10,000 in State &amp; Federal back taxes, incl fines and penalties (multiple years)
I owe $4,750 in tax preparation fees
I owe ± $3,000 in debt that is in collections

I am 45 M, single, no kids. I am not currently working so there is no income at this time. My monthly expenses are approx $3,500

I believe I have negotiated a barter for the tax prep fees to the value of $3k. I will be making arrangements for a payment plan on State &amp; Fed taxes.

My goal is to try and resolve all of this without becoming destitute! I have some physical assets I did not mention so far worth approximately $25k, excluding car, etc. But they are not very liquid and have good upside potential so ideally would like to hang on to those a little longer if possible.

I see the many mistakes I have made and learned some valuable lessons. I have a plan in place that I'm ready to execute on, but wanted to know if PF could shine some light on how best to handle this situation so I can avoid F-ing things up again!

MachineLearning,"Any resource for ""systematic"" study of NNs?","After getting basic understanding of NNs, I'm wondering:

We start with a very simple network: 1 input 1 parameter 1 output. We think of all possible ways it could be set up (I guess this would create a 2 variable system, one being input, and the other being the only parameter)

Then we consider:

- 1 input, 2 parameters
- 1 input, n parameters
- 2 inputs, 1 parameter
- 2 inputs, 2 parameters

and so on. Obviously there are two many cases but we can make some observations:

- We don't need parameters that are fed partial inputs, e.g., for a 2 input network, all our parameters have 2 inputs. We don't need any parameter with 1 input because it's the equivalent of a 2-input parameter one of which is zero.
- We can limit n, e.g., for 1 grayscale pixel, input is 0-255. Maybe we can use this to conclude a value of n beyond which further enumeration is superfluous.


Anyway I hope you get the idea. So my question is, is there any resource, tutorial, article, book chapter that discusses neural networks along these lines?

second question: is there something like a directory/collection of well-known neural network designs? (**EDIT 1**: in other words, well-known NN architectures).

He informed me of a program called Foster Care to Success that provides vouchers up to $5,000 and tuition waivers to youths who have been in foster care until they turn sixteen. Hearing that I might be able to attend college naturally I was elated to say the least. After a meeting with a counselor at my high school it turned out that she had never even heard of the program. I called around to more then twenty high schools and only one counselor had even heard of the program. I filled out my FASFA and applied to the program.

It wasn't until September of 2014 I found out this was not the case at all. The university used my federal aid to pay for my tuition and ignored the tuition waiver all together. With over $3500 in costs left I used the small savings I had amassed while living in my Foster Home to pay it. Throughout the semester I worked on campus saving up money to cover the next semesters room and meal plan expenses. Regretfully I put off paying the expenses until May seeing as the cost would stay fixed, which was supposed to allow me to have peace of mind for any expenses that may have been expensive that popped up through the year.

I'm currently renting out the flat, but am only able to attain £600pm for rent, minus 7% agent handling fee (£42), minus £45 for the building association (building insurance, communal electric bill, water bill) -- in total leaving me out of pocket each month by ~£167 (assuming there is no work to be done to the flat or if any appliances break which I will need to pay for, etc).

Am I better or worse off selling the flat now, or holding onto it, in hopes that the value will keep appreciating?

I've tried to do the maths on this so many times but it all gets a bit too much for me. I can afford the ~£167 monthly outgoing, but I feel like I could be doing something better with my money.",finance,1445357428
personalfinance,When is it a good idea to take out a 403(b)/401(k) loan?,"Here's my dilemma: I am in my late 20's and have a substantial amount of credit card debt from a rough spot several years ago. While I was making some serious headway paying it off, I recently had to restructure my monthly budget and am now able to pay only slightly above the minimum. If I keep this up, I can *probably* have them paid off in about 4-5 years.

BUT: I am now fully vested in my employer's 403(b) plan, which I had aggressively contributed to up until the recent budget issues. I could borrow about 25% of my vested balance to pay off the accounts at a much lower interest rate (50+% lower, in fact) and, sticking to the same budget, pay it back in exactly 3 years. I'd also clear the debt from my credit report immediately, which feels like a pretty big positive, and pay interest to myself rather a bank.

I have done some research and am aware of the risks involved in borrowing from my own retirement, including immediate repayment upon quitting/termination (or else face early distribution penalties) and the fact that the market could perform better than the loan interest rate. I have also looked into personal loans, but the interest rates and terms weren't nearly as good as the 403(b)'s.

So . . . should I really be considering this? On paper, it seems like a good option for someone willing to assume a little risk with part of their retirements savings.",finance,1445358277

personalfinance,Bank recommendations? Opening my first accounts and am trying to sift through the options.,"As many millennials like myself, high school and college teach more about algebra than they do personal finance, so treat me like I've never seen a bank before. 

I have recently moved to a new state and have had a saving and checking account with a local credit union since I was a child. Now looking through the banks available, I've realized that I have no idea what I should be looking for in a banks offerings, since I had a bank for most of my life and thought nothing of it.

I understand the credit unions and why I might want to choose them over a national bank, but the mobile banking options and convenience of having them are enticing. I don't know where I'll be in the future and would rather not keep opening up accounts in credit unions wherever I move.

I was looking at Chase because of their mobile banking systems seem quite robust, but customer reviews and low savings interest rates keep me away. 
I've also looked into non physical banks like Ally. But, I'm not exactly how something like that would work.

Since I moved here, I'm starting from zero. I have one check worth 500 dollars. Where can I go and what recommendations do you have. Thank you.",finance,1445360114
personalfinance,Is it smart to refinance?,"Hey PF,

Looking for some advice on refinancing a recently purchased home. Here is the quick backstory:


Bought first house in april 2013: 167k, FHA, 3.5% down

Bought second house in July 2015: 365k, Conven, 5% down (interest rate: 4.375)

Sold first house in August 2015: 210k, we got about ~45k back after fees and all that


We would have liked to put 20% down on the second house, but our savings alone wouldn't cut it, we needed the equity from our first house. Since we've moved into our new house we've been making good headway on paying extra each month and everything (our principle is down to 339k). I want to pay this house off aggressively. I particularly want to get rid of waste (PMI/Interest) in the monthly mortgage payment. With rates coming down, do you all think it makes sense to refinance so quickly after buying? Will this negatively affect my credit score? We have enough in our checking/savings to get down to 20%. If we just keep throwing money at the house when we get to 20% loan to value ratio, will they drop PMI without a refi (I know i'll have to request it in writing)?",finance,1445362887
personalfinance,Does taking private student loans beyond estimated cost of attendance jeopardize future eligibility for Federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans?,"Hello,

I'm currently in my second year of law school in NYC. I have taken Federal loans up to the estimated cost of attendance. I can get by, barely, with the loans I have right now. However, since I have such high future earning potential I want to take a private loan now to pay off some higher interest credit card debt and get furnishings for my apartment. The loan has a reasonable interest rate, no prepayment penalty, no origination fees, and no payments until I finish school. 

What concerns me is a disclosure in the application that ""If you borrow more than the cost of attendance, you risk reducing your eligibility for free or lower-cost federal, state, or school financial aid."" Would taking a private student loans on top of the subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans I have taken out reduce the amount I am eligible to borrow in federal loans for next year (my final year of law school)?

Since this is the time of year for open enrollment at a lot of places, I thought I would share this tool here. I used it on my current benefit deductions and it got within $1 so it appears to be pretty accurate.

I did a little research on which benefits are Federal Income Tax Exempt and which are Federal and FICA exempt since the calculator will take those payroll deductions into consideration. I've provided the list below. Please let me know if I've made a mistake and I'll correct it.

Federal Income Tax and FICA Tax Exempt Benefits

* Health Insurance Premiums
* Flexible Dependent Care Accounts
* Flexible Spending Accounts
* Health Savings Accounts
* Long Term Disability Insurance
* Some life insurance policies under $50,000

Federal Income Tax Exempt Benefits (you still pay FICA)

* Retirement Contributions (401k, 403b, 457b, etc)
* Life Insurance for policies over $50,000

It seems that most benefits that are federal tax exempt are also state tax exempt but that depends on the state.

For me personally, I knew I was going to use the Flexible Dependent Care Account my employer offers but I wasn't sure how it was going to impact my take home pay next year.

Also, this formatting looks a lot better in the text box I typed it in... I don't know what I'm doing

&amp;nbsp;

**Current Numbers**

Income: $41,800

Expenses: ~$10155 last year

Current Investments: ~$40,000

&amp;nbsp;

**2016 Pre-tax Investments*

401k: $18,000 (20% employer match to whatever I put in, so $15,000 from me)

Traditional IRA: $5,500

HSA: $3,300

&amp;nbsp;

This leaves me with $18,000 of taxable income.

I used a calculator online and checked it myself, and I’ll end up paying about

$1,316.25 in federal taxes,

$1,198.65 in state taxes and

$1,500 in Fica/Medicare Taxes

Leaving me with an after-tax income of $13,985.10

&amp;nbsp;

This all results in me having 

$2,233.33 in pre-tax investments per month

$1165.43 in take-home pay per month

&amp;nbsp;

Since I already have a safety fund, I figure I can safely invest the excess taxable income so really that becomes

$2,233.33 in pre-tax investments per month and

$319.14 in after-tax investments per month

giving me a savings rate of 75.1%

&amp;nbsp;

**Overall Plan**

I know that there will be changes in both my expenses and income, but I have no way at predicting them, so I’m just going to use my current numbers to project out into my future, as it’s the best I can do.

If I do this for ~10 years and gain literally no interest, on any of my investments along the way there, I’ll end up with $346,962.71. ($38,296.71 of which is taxable investments)

I’m then planning on using a 72(t) on my 401k, and a Roth conversion ladder on my traditional IRA funds and a 3% SWR rate to pull out $10,408.88 per year, effectively retiring.

&amp;nbsp;

**Issues**

First, I know someone is going to tell me that I’ll need more than $10,408.88 per year when I’m 34. I may or may not, but either way I’ve worked in what I expect to be a considerable safety factor by assuming no real interest on my investments, which is unlikely.

Second, the biggest unknown for me is that I’m not sure how to figure out how much of my 401k I can actually pull out with a 72(t). I’ve read a bit about it, but I’m not sure what ages to use for owner’s age at death, or what %s are actually allowed as I’ve seen anywhere from 2% - ~5.5% displayed, and I’m not sure under what conditions each of the rates apply.

Third, I’m just not sure if I’ve missed anything, but if I did I’ll bet someone on here catches it!",finance,1445387463

During the test drive, I absolutely loved it. Kelley Blue Book and other various car reports that came up during a google search rated the car as a great deal for the money and, overall, a nice car. So, I purchased the car, and loved it.

Fast forward 3 weeks. The transmission is feeling a little ""funny"" (i.e. slipping, chugging in lower gears/during acceleration from a dead stop). People from Ford claim that this is not a problem but it is mostly the result of a new type of transmission designed for this car. So, I go on about life thinking that this is how the car is supposed to run. 30 day warranty with Carmax expires.

Fast forward some more to 4 days ago: I'm driving out of town and the car is literally bouncing during take-offs from a dead stop. And it's not improving. Pulling out into traffic has become dangerous because the car won't accelerate fast enough. This is clearly not okay nor should any car operate like this. Not to mention my anxiety is through the roof during my trip worrying whether or not my car with only 48,000 miles on it is going to break down.

So, here's my problem and what I need help with: I'm taking the car to the Ford dealership tomorrow to have their shop look at it. The guy on the phone today already said (again) this is how the car is supposed to run. I'm not buying it. As soon as I googled ""Ford Fiesta Transmission"", there are hundreds of reports discussing the same issue. There's even a class action lawsuit being taken out against Ford for the shoddy production of the Fiesta's transmission. I also feel like Carmax swept this common problem under the rug in order to make a sale. 

I financed through my bank (NC State Employees Credit Union) because of super low interest rates for members and got an $11,500 loan. Paid $1,200 down payment to Carmax so essentially I still owe about $10,000. I do not make my first payment until Oct. 25th. What do I do?!?! Sell it back to Carmax or a Dealership and put what I make towards my loan? Trade the car in for something else and take on whatever is remaining to another loan? Or just deal with the piece of shit and hope to god it lasts me 5 years? Are there other options I'm not seeing?

personalfinance,"24, $95,000 in student loan debt, earning $42,500 - Treading Water","Hi everyone. To give a little back story, my parents never discussed finances with my sisters or me. We went to private school all of our lives, and when college came, my parents never said anything about paying for it. I stupidly never asked. I went to an out-of-state private college. I had no idea my parents were using loans in their and my name to pay for it until my first semester senior year.

In the end, I graduated in 2013 with a B.S. in healthcare admin with a little under $100,000 in student loan debt. I am about to turn 25 in 2 months. I have a job that earns ~$40-45,000 in the healthcare field while working 40-55 hours per week. I earn approximately $1,200 every two weeks, sometimes a little more/less based on my overtime. This is after taxes, healthcare, deductions, and retirement savings. The reason I contribute to retirement is if I give 5%, my company matches my 5%, and then gives me an additional 7% for a total of 12% on top of my 5%. 

I currently owe…
-$13,635 in a private loan (8.29% / fixed / lowest payment -$250 per month payments)
-$33,101 in federal loans (vary between 3.4% and 6.8% / all fixed / 4 unsubsidized, 3 subsidized / $370 per month payments)
-$45,954 in parent PLUS loans (In my parents name, however, I am paying them / 7.9% / max length, lowest payment / fixed / $419 per month payments)

The job that I am in is not a career. There is no vertical advancement beyond where I am. I am considering going back for nursing school, which would earn me approximately $65,000 out of school to start. The issue is that I would need 4 more pre-requisites. Univ. of Phoenix has these classes for $1,800 a piece, which would work with my varying healthcare schedule. 

Nursing school will be approximately $45,000 additionally for a 1-year program. In this case, I would need to take out additional loans for school/rent/utilities/food/etc. or leave my job next year, find a 9-5 and do a 2-3 year nursing program at night. 

My monthly budget currently looks like this. Mind you, I take home around $2400 per month.
Student Loans - $1,039
Rent – $560 (I have 3 roommates)
Utilities - $125
Car Insurance - $90
Car Gas - $25
Food - $400
Entertainment – $75 (I work 13 hour days, I need a little blowing off of steam with friends)
Misc. Purchases - $75 (deodorant, shampoo, random things like windshield wipers when mine wore out, etc.)

I am 20 months into this job. I have an emergency fund of $1,250. My 401(k) is currently at $6,600 or so. I generally average right around $1,000 in my checking account from day to day. This is not from careless spending, as I’m very frugal, but just this overwhelming payment structure. I have not done IBR for my federal loans this year, however, last year when I was earning $5,000 less, I had IBR. It was only a reduction of $60 per month on that $365. 

If I ever get quick cash (Xmas bonus for example), I put 85-90% of it towards my loans. I don’t go on vacations, never went on spring break in college, and rarely treat myself. I buy cheaper food from an outdoor market-mainly fruits/veggies. My employer offers $5,000 tuition reimbursement for the year, but you are required to stay with them for 1 year following your last class, or you have to pay it all back. 

I don’t know if I should try to take these classes and go back for nursing. I could also just try to find another job at a hospital; however, people that have left my position for hospitals either make the same amount or slightly less starting out. I feel like I’m just treading water each month. 

Any advice/guidance would be appreciated. I have been obsessing over my finances for the last 20 months. Reading as much as I can, working whatever overtime I'm offered, etc. I know I can blame my parents for not telling me about all these loans, but I can also blame myself for blindly going to college and not asking them where the money was coming from.

Thanks for reading and any advice offered.",finance,1445401270

personalfinance,Expat Tax Question: Foriegn Income Exclusion (Physical Presence Test) Do I still qualify?,"Hello,

I have been working overseas as a DoD Contractor since 2013.  I have a question about taxes.  Previously I filed foreign income exclusion for federal (based on Physical Presence Test)  and as a Non resident for California.  I have not had any issues (used HR Block on Base).

This year (Jan 2015 - Dec 2015) is what I would like to ask a question about.  The contract I have been on has been getting extended in 1 / 2 month increments.  It unfortunately did not get extended this last run.  This means in November the contract will be done and I will be repatriated to the US.  

My questions is: 

Foreign income exclusion is met if you live in a foreign country for 330 out of 365 day (Physical Presence Test). If I was to let my company send me to the US.  Then on my own dime finish living the year in Korea (or abroad on vacation) still allow me to qualify for Foreign Income Exlusion? Let me file a 2555ez?  I ask because the way I read the Physical Presence Test it doesn't state you have to be abroad for employment.  I would obviously limit my time in the US to less then 29 days to ensure I don't break the 35 day limit during the 12 month period.

Same question for CA Taxes:
I previously have filed as a Non Resident (I have no CA banks or property...just CA Driver License). Previous to 2013 I was overseas but as military (USAF) and have not lived in CA for the last 15 years (never been back after I enlisted and left in 1999).  

Thanks in advance for any information.

A few days ago I received an overnight FedEx package from Lakeview Loan Servicing notifying me that I am eligible to refi at a lower interest rate.  My rate would be about .5% lower than my current rate, reducing my monthly payment by $155.  I spoke with the originator from LLS last night and I got the 'used car salesman' vibe from him.  Talked really fast, asked open ended questions and pretty much told me what I wanted to hear.
After going over all of the paperwork, it seems that nothing will change for me other than paying less $$ monthly.  Cenlar will still have the loan, I will make the payments the same way and they will allow me to 'skip' December if we close at the end of November.  Nothing out of pocket, its just eSign the paperwork and should be done.  Sounds too good to be true.  Am I missing something here?  What does Cenlar/Lakeview Loan Servicing have to gain?  They have some pretty bad reviews on BBB website but most of those issues wouldn't apply to me.

personalfinance,Got my first full time job and now I'm having issues saving.,"I'm 23 and I've had my full time job for almost a year now. I thought that once I had more money coming in i'd be able to save with no problem. But I was wrong. Since I have more money in my account I've developed more of a spending problem. My issue is that since I was so used to living paycheck to paycheck, if I see extra money in my account I feel the need to spend it. 

I want to try and figure out a different solution than just trying to discipline myself, because that's not working right now. I was considering opening up a high yield savings account with GE Capitol bank since they have the highest interest rate right now. I feel like if I automatically have a certain amount of money taken out of my paycheck every month and transferred into this account it might help. This way, as long as I don't check the account I technically wont see the money until I need it.

Only issue is, I'm not sure if this is the best solution. Which is why i'm coming here. Is this solution the best way to save money or is there something else I can do that I don't know about?",finance,1445434389

investing,Why does the federal reserve use temporary repurchase agreements to control the interest rate instead of simply purchasing treasuries outright like it does with QE?,"I am starting to really understand the federal reserve system but I have a few more things that I really want to understand and one of them is why does the Federal reserve use temporary repo loans to add liquidity into the banking system in order to reduce interest rates instead of directly buying treasuries outright like it does during QE.

I understand that the federal reserve is able to influence the intraday banking interest rates (fed funds rate) by purchasing treasuries from it's primary dealers. This in turn helps with liquidity requirements and so the banks don't need to borrow and hence their reserve requirements are mostly met. 

Why does it need to use a repo which means that the liquidity will be drained out of the system a couple of weeks later? 

Is it because it is a temporary measure and the banks can't just go playing with the money because the money is owed back to the central bank?

If that is the case then why do private banks even partake in the repos? What is in it for them? Why would they bother selling their treasuries since they are income producing assets to the bank?",finance,1445435409

personalfinance,Keep $80k Fed Loans @ 6.8% and pay off by Dec 2016 or refi @ 4.615% and pay off more slowly?,"Hello, Reddit! Sofi has offered me a refi of my $80k in student loans at 3.999% 5-year fixed or 4.615% 10-year fixed. I'm not sure whether to refi or just keep going hard on the student loan payment or some combination. I'm hoping you all can help me think through this.

My initial goal last year was to pay my student loans off as aggressively as possible. However, I am now 32 and am starting to feel anxious about only having $23,000 saved for retirement (32M husband has $0 saved for retirement). I am newly married and the primary breadwinner for our family. My husband is a recent immigrant who is just starting out his career and looking for higher-paid work. He has no debt of any kind.

My 2014 AGI was a little over $124,000. My 2015 AGI is anticipated to be $215,000 between my salary and owners draws from the business profits. I'm thinking after tax that will be $150k takehome for 2015 and higher in 2016.

My current IBR payment is $1200 and my 2016 IBR loan payment would be $1400. The 2016 Standard Payment would be $1250, so actually lower if I leave IBR.

Some things to consider are that I run a seasonal business (been in business 5.5 years) as an independent adviser on how to get into Ivy League schools. I make 76% of my income in the last 5 months of each year but there is administrative and marketing work to do all year (though if I'm honest with myself, I could probably take on a part-time job for Jan - July). Business has steadily grown every year at least 60% year-over-year. However, I recognize that my industry could get ""disrupted"" at any point and I could be out in the job market where I'd earn between $70k - $150k working in marketing, sales, or higher educational administration.

We have an emergency fund of $12k, mainly because I shovel all extra cash toward student loan payments. Our living expenses are about $4000 per month. We have no other savings.

My main concern with refinancing is that something could happen to me, my business, or my industry (e.g. new regulations or a new fierce competitor) that makes my income less abundant or less reliable. My main interest in refinancing is the possibility to pay off my loans more slowly and save more for retirement and for a house purchase in 2017.

Thank you for any and all feedback!

I finished my Masters degree a few days ago and got a job offer to work as an engineer. I just read through the contract: 

I will be working 35 hour weeks 

The breakdown of the salary as outlined in my contract is: 
Year 1: 75k
Year 2: 77k
Year 3: 80k
Year 4: 80k
After becoming chartered
Year 5: 89k
Year 6: 92k
Year 7 95.5k
Year 8: 100k
Year 9: 102k
Year 10: 106k 
Stops at this amount unless I get promoted. 
$896.5k Gross over 10 years

The country that I am working in has a currency that is 1:1 with the US dollar, however, it does not have income tax ,capital gains tax, purchase or sales tax, VAT or capital transfer tax. Instead it has something called payroll tax, which is 5.25% of the salary annual gross each year. I also need to pay social insurance, which is $1664 each year along with health insurance, which is $3960 each year. 

The job does have a pension scheme that requires me to put 8% of my annual salary into the scheme. The company matches the 8%. 

With this said, I am debt free because I managed to win a few scholarships that covered most of the funding needed for me to go to university. 

What would be the best way to save or invest my money? I was considering opening a 5 year fixed deposit account at the bank. This gives an interest rate of 2%. I was also considering investing in premium bonds. When I have enough capital I want to start investing in real estate eventually but until that time I need to come up with a good plan. 

Also to note is that I am 23 years old and am currently living at home with my parents. I wanted to help my parents pay off the house mortgage, so offering to pay about 1.5k a month to them. The property and house is large so in the future I plan on converting my bedroom and a portion of the house into a separate 1 bed room apartment. This would need a bit of money for the construction costs, so I will need to consider this in my savings plan. I expect to start construction within the next 4 years. 

The hope is that when I eventually move out into a larger house, I can then rent out the 1 bed room apartment for extra cash on the side.

This is starting to eat me alive, as I have just become aware of the stupidity of making minimum payments on Private SL's. I have two outstanding loans with Discover that total around $8,500. These two loans have the highest interest rate of all my outstanding loans at 10.875% and 9.875%. That would leave me with about a $2,000 emergency nest egg in my Smart checking account (INT rate on it is about 2%, better than any savings acct)... I owe just over $35K in Private Loans to Citi and Discover, and want to pay those off first before attacking the Federal Loans. Would it be smart to pay off those two loans before deciding to refinance the rest of the Private loans? Or should I refinance the full 35K and then pay off as much as I can? I'm thinking that if I decide to ReFi, then I need to hold off ordering a credit report from one of the three major credit agencies to avoid too many hard inquiries in a short amount of time. 

Other details:
Take home wages for the month are about $2,200/month on average. I've been able to save about $600-$800 per month and have been stockpiling that away in my checking towards saving for a large down payment for a home. I realize that paying off the debt first will be far more beneficial financially, so that is why I have changed plans. My student loan payments per month are $435 total, and this is minimum payments to Citi, Discover, and Fedloan Servicing for the Federal Loans. Another thing to mention that makes the whole situation more sensitive and complicated is the recent probes/investigations that Citi and Discover are under by the CFPB for overstating minimum payments, convuluted information, unethical collection practices, etc.

personalfinance,Sanity Check: Should I borrow to invest?,"I'll try and keep it short and succinct.

**Basic background;**

I'm in my early 30s and due to a series of unfortunate events I've lost pretty much all my retirement funds and had to take a junior position in a new career out of desperation(being unemployed for near on 7 months can be... challenging). I'd rather not go into the specifics as to what happened, to keep things focussed.

The fact that I currently have no retirement savings weighs heavily on my mind. Then an investment idea occurred to me, and I need some knowledgable folks to do a sanity check for me. Oh, and I'm not from the US, so please bear that in mind when considering specific solutions or alternatives.

I currently have a home loan that's more or less 40% paid off. I'm paying a annual rate of 8.5% and have about 28 years left on the bond. That, plus about a half of my vehicle financing is the only debt I have. My home is a small flat and downscaling even more is not really possible. 

My salary is not very high, and I'm pretty much living paycheck-to-paycheck. The bank would be willing to allow me a further extension of my loan, I'm thinking I can manage about R200 000(I'm in South Africa) extra.

I have a very small amount of money in the [Deutsche Bank MSCI World Index ETF](https://etf.deutscheawm.com/ZAF/ENG/ETF/ZAE000115184/-/MSCI-World-Index-ETF) and the performance has been very good so far. The annual return over the last 5 years was around 20%. Please click the link if you want to see specific information and metrics.

**Now, the basic question**

Would it be a terribly bad idea to take R200 000 from my bond and put it in as a lumpsum investment into the ETF(with dividend reinvestments) for the next 30 years, and just leave it there and never touch it? I know I'd be paying interest on that amount but the cost of capital compared to the likely returns from the ETF seems to definitely result in a positive NPV.

**Some other things to consider:**

* My home loan interest rate is a floating rate. If the central bank decides to increase the repo rate my 8.5% could climb a bit higher. If it goes to crazy levels I could always sell my shares again.

* The ETF is a world index tracker. If it crashes to a catastrophic level, I'm fucked anyways(we all would be).

* Inflation here is currently around 5%.

* If my new career goes as planned, I could theoretically earn about 30% more by this time next year, and would be in a position to pay off my home loan a bit faster, saving on interest charges.

* I'm considering *borrowing* the money to put down a big lumpsum simply because of the time value of money. 200K invested now over 30 years is better than investing 550 pm from now on. Right?

With consolidation they have a variable and fixed interest rate. The variable rate is from 3.49% to 8.49% and the fixed rate is from 6.74% to 11.79%. Should I consolidate these loans, and if so should I go fixed or variable? If I don't consolidate what is the best methods to pay these down, and is there anything I should look out for when trying to consolidate my loans? Does consolidating diminish your credit score? I have a lot of questions just write back as if you are typing to a dummy about credit and consolidation. 

I currently only work one job and I am thinking about picking up a second job. Currently, my debt doubles what I make in a year. I would really like to pay this off in 5 years. I know this seems ridiculous, but I need to do something. I have no other debt.",finance,1445471478

personalfinance,Greetings Personal Finance SubReddit! I need the ELI5 advice on HOME EQUITY LOANS!,"Hey guys, this is my first post on this subreddit! 

Me and my brother are starting a franchise which has startup costs of $300,000. We are both contributing $80,000 each for a total of $160,000. We need $140,000 in loans to cover the difference, and we are considering all the possibilities. At first we thought of getting an SBA loan, but recently my brother mentioned getting a home equity loan/line of credit...which brings us to our first question: Are Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit the same thing?

Basically I'm here to ask what type of loan the personal finance guros would recommend, and hopefully explain what the loan will entail (interest rates and other pertinent information I am not aware of). 

My house is worth $220,000, and I owe $150,000...I'm 51, and have horrible gambling habits...I have about 31% equity on the house and my income after taxes is about $95,000.

I'm not sure what additional information to give you guys so if you require more insight to my finances just let me know so I can edit the main post right away. Any and all advice and information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance personal finance subreddit!",finance,1445479161
personalfinance,What should I do with my stock?,"Hello PF:

I'm a 31 y/o redditor with less than 100 shares of a stock that was given to me by a family member years ago that is worth roughly $6,000 and I'm looking for some advice on what I should do with it.

A little background about my current situation:
Single, 31 y/o homeowner, Zillow (ha) says its worth about $110,000, I owe roughly $86,000 on it. 15 year mortgage at 3% (just refinanced), $940/month mortgage payment.
Full time employed, about $2,800/month (roughly $37,000 a year, after taxes).
I max out a Roth IRA at $458 every month, currently its worth about $9,000.
$1,900 in student loan debt. Interest rate is super low, so I'm fine paying $100/month til its gone.
I have two roommates that give me $450 each/per month, but I pay all of the bills associated with the house (gas/electric, water, tv, internet, and obviously the mortgage). I've averaged it out: all three of us pay almost exactly $450/month each to live here.
Credit card: my monthly expenses average roughly $2,100 ( I try to put everything on my credit card to earn pointssss) (I could probably cut plenty of expenses, but I live comfortably and like it and that's not what this post is about anyways).
I have $4,500 in my emergency fund.
I have $1,000 in my other savings account. Its meant to be my 'home improvement fund', but in practice, it basically becomes a slush fund when I have a higher than usual credit card bill or other expenses. 
Checking account fluctuates between paychecks and bills.

Now to the actual reason you've read all this: what should I do with the $6K worth of stock I own? My feeling is that the market is pretty good now, and I don't see the worth of my stock rising drastically. Certainly not enough to keep the money in there. Like any homeowner, I have an endless list of things I'd like to do to my house: kitchen facelift, new bathroom, install central air, replace my gas lines (I love old homes, but they're a pain sometimes), paint my house, landscape my property. Its literally an endless list, and that's fine. But would the money do me more good else where? Should I beef up my emergency fund? Should I invest some of it in house renovation? Should I keep it in the market? Should I open a second Roth IRA account (can I even do that)?

I don't see a pay increase on the horizon at the moment, so a second Roth may be a bit unrealistic unless I drastically cut back on unnecessary spending. I plan to stay in this house for roughly another 5-10 years, until an eventual wife and children necessitate a bigger house. I may sell it, but more than likely, I'd like to rent it out as I live pretty close to a university. 

Really interested in any and all serious advice on what I could or should do with the stock. If you have other advice on my financial situation, please feel free to critique or advise. I love reading posts on this subreddit and I love reading all the helpful advice redditors offer, because you guys are awesome and helpful. Thanks in advance!",finance,1445483308
personalfinance,How much house equity should one have compared to investment equity?,"Hello all.  The wife and I will be purchasing a home soon.  We have saved up the 20% down payment for the top of our price range (this does not include a 20k emergency fund, which we have sitting in a separate account).  

Which is where my dilemma comes.  Once we buy the house, we'll have about half of our net worth tied up in the house vs. how much we have in our retirement investment accounts (3 fund portfolio).  My gut reaction would be to try to pay off the mortgage early, but mathematically it's better to invest at an average 7% rate of return vs 4% rate of return paying off the mortgage early.  I'm trying to ignore my gut and invest with my brain.  I also feel like it's a bad idea to have too much equity tied up in the house because of how illiquid real estate is.

So, my plan is to pay the mortgage off as scheduled (we'll be choosing a 30 year fixed) until we have a better ratio of equity in the house vs. investments.

Here is my big question:  what is the ideal ratio of equity to have in a home vs investments?  I'm thinking I'd like to have five to six times as much in investments vs equity in the house before I even think about making extra mortgage payments.  I'm basically pulling this figure out of the air because I don't want real estate to be a huge part of my net worth.  Does this sound reasonable?

I googled a bit and couldn't find a recommended equity allocation, so I am very interested in everyone's thoughts or personal allocation in this situation.

Additional information that may or may not be relevant:

We can currently put about 3-5k in investments per month after all our bills, debts, and living expenses each month (the wife and I both make base + commission, which accounts for the variance).

We have two car loans at 15k each for a total of 30k.  One loan is at 1.49% interest and one is at 2.25% interest.  They both have about 3.5 years left.  I see no reason to pay these off early because of the low interest rate.  

I would like to pay off the house in 20 years max.  15-17 would be ideal.

No other debt.

TL;DR:  What is the proper ratio of house equity to investment equity?",finance,1445485231
personalfinance,(US) 200k+ of fedloan student debt. Deferment vrs Pay as you earn?,"Hello Personal Finance,

I am a 29 year old Dentist who graduated with a little north of 200k in federal student loan debt.  The loans are Direct subsidized loans and Direct unsubsidized loans at a 6.8% interest rate.

I am currently in a residency which pays me only $5,000 a year. I don't qualify as a student as I don't pay tuition or anything like that.  Last year I was on Pay As You Earn, and of course didn't pay anything.  Now I am looking at deferment instead and it seems to imply that the interest on my Direct subsidized loans which accrues during the period of deferment would be payed by the government. 

Should I be trying to defer here? or stick with Pay as you earn?

personalfinance,Looking for guidance for handling income after college,"Hi, /r/personalfinance! 

I am looking for advice for how to handle my money. I grew up in a household with one parent who constantly built CC debt and another parent who lived so frugally that I grew up constantly thinking about money. My point is, I've never had great guidance for how to actually be financially responsible while still enjoying life. 

My situation: I graduated from a liberal arts school in May. I have around $33,000 in student loans, around $5000 of which are private. In hindsight I would have gone to a different school in order to minimize or eliminate those loans, but 18 year old me did not really understand the gravity of student loans, so here I am. I just want to learn to be financially responsible while I'm starting out and not screw up more than I already have. 

Since graduating, I moved across the country and have been working as a nanny for a couple of months. I am hoping to attend Officer School for one the military branches (omitting it just to maintain privacy, but all O-1s make the same anyway). As a nanny I make $225 per week but my rent and most of my food is included. Moving cross country as well as a couple of last minute flights I've had to make home have meant I haven't gotten to save much of this and have also had to tap into savings I did have. I have $760 in a savings account and around $400 in checking, and I've been using YNAB for a few weeks now. I have a credit card that I am using to build credit, but it has a $0 balance as I always pay it on time. 

After graduating I was hoping to leave for Officer School as soon as possible, but various surprises and complications have pushed it back further and further, and at this point I am not expecting to leave for at least another six months. In the meantime, I just accepted a job offer at a software company (they know that I will leave if I am accepted to military) that I think is pretty great financially for someone who just graduated. I begin at the end of November, and I'll be making $50,000 per year with a 10% performance-based bonus (although I doubt I'll be around to get it next year, I know that it will be prorated for 2015, so I should get a little something back, at least). They also have great insurance options (I've been without insurance for a couple of years now which is always a scary thought in the back of my mind) and it looks I'll be paying anywhere between around $90 and $140 per month for that depending on whether I go with the gold or the silver plan. The job also has 401k which they don't match anything for. 

Once I start working at my new job, I tentatively have living arrangements where it appears that I'll be paying somewhere in the ballpark of $600-800 including utilities (still working out the details, a friend's mother just bought a house that I've been offered a room in). I have a paid off small 2001 SUV that I plan to drive until it doesn't run, but because I think that time will arrive sooner than later, that's something I need to be planning for (I want something used, reliable, and under $10,000 that still has the space I'm accustomed to in an SUV). I have an ~$40/month phone bill, and I pay ~$55 per month for car insurance. 

I currently have my federal loans set on an IBR plan which is zero, but I need to change that now that I am going to be making a better amount. My two private loans are through Discover Student Loans (took them out before my freshman year, my mom signed one of them with me and they're the biggest regrets of my life other than not going to a cheaper college to begin with) and I called last week to set up a payment plan, to which they said that I can't do anything until my grace period ends on November 6th, which seems fishy to me. 

I know this is a long post and I apologize, but for all you finance experts reading, what would you do if you were me? I want to begin working on my student loans and save responsibly but also enjoy my youth to a degree and not have to stress about money excessively. If I am accepted to Officer School, I am planning to accept a $25000 low interest career starter loan upon commissioning and use it to refinance the highest interest loans that I have remaining, but since I have no way of knowing how far away that is, I need to start doing real work on them now. 

Quick list of expenses in about a month:
~$700 rent/utilities
~$40 phone
~$54 car insurance 
~$120 gas

*need to save for a car and emergencies 
*need to reasonably budget for things like food, etc.

I've been subscribed here for a while and seen you give out some solid advice before. Now my circumstances have changed I thought I would seek your advice.

Unfortunately, I haven't been given a lot of money by a dying relative, and I never will. Hopefully you can still help me!

A bit of background, I am 27, engaged and have been working for my current company for three years. My fiance and I separate our finances, but for what it's worth she is on roughly the same pay bracket as me.

After highschool I worked for a few years before deciding to try my hand at a higher education. I worked my way through a 4 year degree and graduated at 24. Afterr graduating, i got a job at my current workplace. After three years I have paid off my student debt and bought an apartment (i own alone).  I owe the bank about 350,000, and the apartment is worth maybe 440 000. Through a three year contract (in my second month now) with my company I am now living overseas (rent free) and after living expenses, tax and 500 I send home to mum, I put about 8,000 in the bank every month. 

I am only paying the interest on my home loan (about 1,200 a month) so no principal. It is currently rented and the rent brings in about 1,500 a month.  The money I bank through work goes into a 100% offset account and so i don't pay interest one what i have in the bank.  I have a 4.2% variable interest rate.

Now you are caught up, what do i do next!? I am happy to just put all the money into my bank and pay less interest. But is it better to put this cash into something that would bring back more than 4.25%. I am skeptical of the stock market after my father lost a lot of money in it when I was a kid, but not opposed to it. I already have about 15% of my income (not included in what i have discussed above) that goes into a stock market fund for my retirement. 

*This post isn't in US dollars but not far off.

personalfinance,[SWE] My condo has increased in price quite a bit this last year. Can use this to my advantage somehow?,"Me and my gf own a condo (I think that's the right word, it's an apartment you own and not rent) together. We each own 50% each and she's got some loans on her part, while my part is totally loan free.

Since we moved in the value of our condo has increased by about $180000.

 I came to this number by 1. Consulting two different realtors in my neighborhood and 2. Looking at similar condos that's been sold these recent 2 months.

Of course this is super exciting for us and it's a nice start on our way to FIRE. But is there anything else I can do to take advantage of this increase in value? 

Would it be better to take out a loan on the condo (which has an interest rate of about 2%) and invest this money? Or would this be a bad idea?

personalfinance,First job in a country with no income tax. What is the best method of saving my money?,"Hi everyone,
I finished my Masters degree a few days ago and got a job offer to work as an engineer. I just read through the contract:
I will be working 35 hour weeks

The breakdown of the salary as outlined in my contract is: Year 1: 75k, Year 2: 77k, Year 3: 80k, Year 4: 80k, After becoming chartered Year 5: 89k, Year 6: 92k, Year 7 95.5k, Year 8: 100k, Year 9: 102k, Year 10: 106k, Stops at this amount unless I get promoted. 

$896.5k Gross over 10 years

The country that I am working in has a currency that is 1:1 with the US dollar, however, it does not have income tax ,capital gains tax, purchase or sales tax, VAT or capital transfer tax. Instead it has something called payroll tax, which is 5.25% of the salary annual gross each year. I also need to pay social insurance, which is $1664 each year along with health insurance, which is $3960 each year.
The job does have a pension scheme that requires me to put 8% of my annual salary into the scheme. The company matches the 8%.
With this said, I am debt free because I managed to win a few scholarships that covered most of the funding needed for me to go to university.

What would be the best way to save or invest my money? I was considering opening a 5 year fixed deposit account at the bank. This gives an interest rate of 2%. I was also considering investing in premium bonds. When I have enough capital I want to start investing in real estate eventually but until that time I need to come up with a good plan.

Also to note is that I am 23 years old and am currently living at home with my parents. I wanted to help my parents pay off the house mortgage, so offering to pay about 1.5k a month to them. The property and house is large so in the future I plan on converting my bedroom and a portion of the house into a separate 1 bed room apartment. This would need a bit of money for the construction costs, so I will need to consider this in my savings plan. I expect to start construction within the next 4 years.
The hope is that when I eventually move out into a larger house, I can then rent out the 1 bed room apartment for extra cash on the side.

personalfinance,How do I decide on liability coverage?,"I'm struggling with determining how much insurance coverage I need for auto/home liability.

I have a net worth of ~$1.4M and income of around $160k. My understanding is that only about $100k of assets and my income would be exposed in the even of a liability judgment (the remainder of the assets are in retirement investments and my residence). 

Right now I am very underinsured because I only have my state minimum Bodily Injury Liability auto coverage of $10k/$20k since forever. The coverage is ""stacked"" for 2 cars so it would cover a liability of $20k per person or $40k accident. 

I spoke with an insurance agent and he recommended a minimum personal injury auto liability coverage of $100k/$300k, and preferred coverage of $250k/$500k. Then he recommended that if I needed higher coverage I should get an umbrella policy. 

My question is how much liability coverage do I *need*? Is there any rule of thumb or calculation based on assets and income that I can use to decide the ""correct"" level of coverage? 


Edit: 

Thanks for the input everyone. After a lot of research I increased my auto coverage to $100k/300k liability. This coverage is stacked on two cars so it actually provides $200/600 of coverage. The difference in price between stacked and unstacked is ridiculously small, ~$10 per year. This level of overage is greater than my exposed assets.  

Here's some additional information I discovered in my research:

* Wage garnishment is limited to 25% federally. Some states have lower limit. Furthermore, I qualify for a head of household exemption because I provide 'more than 50%' of my family's income. This would  effectively prevent any wage garnishment at all. 

* My state exempts retirement accounts, retirement income, and unlimited homestead property from judgement collection. This leaves me with only about $100k in exposed assets that could be collected on. After collecting up to $200k from insurance, my exposed assets are not large enough to provide much incentive for a plaintiff to bother taking me to court in an attempt to win a judgement. I will keep a closer watch on my coverage and bump it up if/when my exposed assets grow.

* The average auto liability settlement is around $300k but the majority settle for less than $100k.

* I did a lot of research on personal injury legal advice forums. The most common advice seemed to be to accept the insurance settlement. Personal injury lawyers and their clients prefer a quick payout rather than a lengthy trial followed by lengthy collection process. All the advice I saw, recommended that plaintiffs strongly consider accepting insurance settlements. By having insurance coverage in excess of exposed assets, I reduce the incentive for a personal injury lawyer to go after my personal assets or wages. There just isn't enough additional money on the table for them to bother with court. Of course, someone who really feels wronged and is looking to punish me could still pursue a case. I think the risk of this is small and I'm willing to accept it.

* So here's my proposed rule of thumb: Your liability coverage should exceed your exposed assets, and at least 4-5 years of wage garnishment (typically 25% of your income per year, less if you qualify for exemptions). If your insurance is considerably less than either of these values, then there is greater incentive for a plaintiff to sue you personally. If your insurance is higher then both these values, then there is less incentive for someone to bother with the trouble of suing you. Higher insurance coverage will help protect against someone who wants their day in court and wants to punish you, but may also just increase the amount that a plaintiff will accept to settle.",finance,1445524444

I have paid off all my credit card debt over the past year (previously I had a balance of $14,000) and now my only two major payments each month are my student loan at $327 (looking to refinance up to $450 at a much lower interest rate where I would pay them off in 5 years instead of 8) and my car payment of $390.

I have a bachelors degree in accounting and my current manager has known that it was always my intention to get back to the accounting/finance industry at some point as I am generally introverted and prefer not to talk on the phones all day, but have surprised myself at how well I've succeeded in sales regardless.

We have achieved our quarterly bonuses every time since I've started but we now have a new director and there seems to be some negative changes coming in my department.

Bitcoin,Re: Blockchain Alliance Please explain: How is an alliance with Homeland Security and ICE is a good thing for Bitcoin tech?,"Some people I respect a great deal have joined this Blockchain Alliance where Bitcoin companies will partner with agencies like the DHS, FBI and Immigration Service (of all things).

I must be missing something because I don't see how this is beneficial.

A couple years back, many industry leaders gladly cheered and supported the ""bold"" and ""progressive"" efforts of Ben Lawsky to proactively regulate Bitcoin. 

At the time, I was one of the very earliest minority voices who spoke out against this and the reasons I thought supporting Lawsky was a terrible idea.

Our industry engaged him, we attended his media show hearings, we cheered at his Reddit AMA marketing and gave him fame, notoriety and legitimacy.   

The result was a horrible and overbearing Bitlicense which took thousands of industry man hours and millions of dollars to roll back to the current point...which is still quite onerous and harmful to business.   Did we learn nothing from this?

Unlike many who thought it was a good idea, I've actually been a regulated investment professional (with a spotless compliance record) for over 20 years...including 18 years as a FINRA General Securities Principal and time as an SEC Registered Investment Advisor.   I've seen first hand the massive harm that many of these regulations do to business while doing little to nothing to actually stop actual fraud or bad behavior.

The investment industry spends billions of dollars annually on compliance with vague and ever changing rules directed by unelected bureaucrats who generally seek to increase influence and power with more far reaching regs.

Meanwhile, derivatives scams, penny stock pumping schemes, dishonest bond underwriting, conflicts of interest, corrupt rating services, fraudulent marketing and outright frauds run rampant.

Even one of their own, Bernie Madoff, the Chairman of the largest industry regulator, the NASD, was not caught for years...despite a 17 page detailed tip from a whistleblower to the SEC.  The regulators simply are not adept at catching bad actors....they are far more adept at creating hurdles for legitimate business.

As with proactively supporting more regulations, the support of the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, ICE and others in partnership with Bitcoin industry leaders is unlikely to yield any positive results in improving the image of Bitcoin OR reducing bad behavior -- but will most certainly result in a form of reverse regulatory capture where the govt officials our industry are dealing with seek increased influence and control over Bitcoin and related technologies.

In what way is Federal involvement in our technology with peaceful, non criminal actors a legitimate role for government?  By what logic does one assume that the government officials and agencies involved will not continually expand and increase influence and control over this technology?  Would the cooperation of the Blockchain Alliance with government agencies continue if the agencies asked for blacklisting of coins, elimination of privacy features, removing fungibiliy features and other requests?  Does the Blockchain Alliance support current actions by the agencies including the current methods of asset forfeiture without trial by which the government can seize property without even charging someone of s crime?  Does the Blockchain Alliance support the Federal government's policy of ignoring the mandates of voters in jurisdictions such as Colorado and prosecuting crimes that the majority of state voters and representatives have already voted against?  Is there ANY law, rule or policy by any future agencies or future politicians which the Blockchain Alliance would refuse cooperation on?   From the current announcements it does not seem so.

I hope I'm wrong and have misunderstood somehow.  

As I said, many I respect a great deal have supported this.",cryptocurrency,1445529330
personalfinance,"Simple job, going back to school, and buying a house","Hello /r/personalfinance:

I have looked over this subreddit many times and this is my first time posting. It's been great to read your advice to others. Now, to the issue at hand. This will be a little long, but I really need some help on some different fronts. I've kinda been scared to post here.

Im early 20s, graduated in 2014 from a university. Planned on going to school after graduating but decided to take some time off, enjoy life, work a little, all that good stuff.

For the first few months, it was very difficult to find a job. I found a very simple one in the industry I'm looking to go into, 40hrs/week at $12.50/hour. I live at home with my mom and currently am only paying on my school loans. I owe ~$30,000.00. Out of around the ~$1500.00 I make per month, $350 goes to loans, and I spend some on food/gas, etc., with close to $800 going into savings each month (my goal has been to try and save close to $1000.00 each month).

I am pretty frugal, and I'd say smart with my money. As mentioned above, I try to save as much as I can. I recognize that saving is extremely important, and I think I learned that from my grandfather, as he pretty much the same way and now is pretty comfortable (he worked a blue collar job his whole life). I don't make huge impulse purchases, I pack my lunch nearly every day, etc. etc.

I plan on going back to school, and I've really tried to take the steps so that I can get a large scholarship by performing well on the entrance exam. I think I've set myself up in a decent position for this.

**First round of questions:** am I being smart right now? Is the saving, and the amount I'm saving, good? Is there anything I could do to even better the situation I'm in now? I wish I made more to help out my mom at home, but she's been gracious enough to not require me to really pay her anything.

**Second part of this:** my SO is a couple years younger than I about to graduate from college. SO will be debt free because her parents are paying for her schooling. Recently, SO's parents wanted to look into purchasing some land/property to assist SO+me and SO's sibling+their SO with obtaining a place to potentially build/move. The point was to make it easier on us in terms of being able to skip the loan process etc etc.

Now, they have been looking at homes in our area for me and SO. SO really wants to purchase a home with her parents' help. Parents are willing to get the loan, and we would pay them back and transfer it over at some point - not here to discuss the details of this arrangement.

They think that it's a possible situation, and SO's parent believes that the economy will change over the next few months/years and interest rates will go up to a point where purchasing a home my be a much more and extremely difficult endeavor, arguing that purchasing something NOW will allow a lower interest rate to be locked in and save thousands of dollars in the long run.

SO will be a teacher, and I'll be in school for a couple years without much of a job.

**Question and my feelings:** Does this sound like a smart situation? What sort of arguments are there for me in terms of arguing against their desire to purchase a home NOW? 

**My thoughts are this:** I have a measly 12.50/hour job. SO works in the afternoons after school and will begin working, hopefully, next fall. At the same time, I'll be going back to school and unable to work, and really won't be bringing in much of anything for a couple years. They seem to think the struggle is worth it to own a house and be ahead of the curve and avoid thousands of more dollars in payment due to a changing economy/interest rates. To me, this is near financial suicide. Payment would be near $900 a month for the house payment, and then other bills on top of that.

I've argued that for the years in which I'm going to school (and will hopefully be attending somewhere where I can live at home and commute, and hopefully on hefty scholarship) my SO could continue to live at home and SAVE a large portion of what they will make as a teacher for the next few years. SO is smart with money -- doesn't spend a lot, doesn't make large impulse purchases, always looks for deals, purchases clothing from secondhand stores and places like Ross, etc. But I think SO is clouded by the desire to purchase a home, having a home at such a young age, sees others around our age ( a little older ) getting houses (likely renting), and just desires that. I've said, save money as you work for a few years while I'm in school. You'll have a lot of money saved as you're good with money, I'll have saved a lot of money from going to school on scholarship and living at home, and the only debt we will have is for my undergrad, which is a totally manageable amount. We both don't have any credit card debt, both have good, reliable vehicles that are paid for. 

We would be good financially, but how much credence is their to the argument about interest rates going up and purchasing a home being much more difficult in a few years? For us, with just my undergrad debt, her saved money, and no other debt owed, wouldn't we be in an ""okay"" position to be able to purchase a small home in a few years? Again, we are both smart with money and don't need an extravagant lifestyle -- we are very simple. 

Anyway, any thoughts on this situation would be great. Any advice or tips and comments on what I'm currently doing would be great. And some good arguments I can present in a smart way to them of WHY this is not a good idea would be great as well. I hope this post picks up traction because I know I've probably got many more questions I can't currently think of.

personalfinance,Pros and Cons of paying off slowly or paying it off as fast as I can?,"Hi folks, I'm trying to wrap my head around what is the best path. I spent the last three years getting completely out of debt only to have my car break down and now I have car debt. 
This is my breakdown and question. Right now I have 10,000 in savings. No investments or other options. I am pretty stable making about 40,000 a year. I have no other debt and have relatively low expenses due so I my extra money that isn't tied up in bills is about 800-1,000 a month, depending on if any unforeseen expenses come up.  I have a car loan for about 9,000 at 4.5% interest rate. I used up about 5,000 in savings to put a down payment and since that made me really nervous I initially wanted to spend all my extra income replenishing that to 20,000 and then working on investing. However, now I'm wondering if it would be better to keep the savings at 10,000 and use all my discretionary money to pay off the loan asap. So my question; should i replenish the savings, focus on paying off the loan or an investment option? Thanks , I know this is probably a simple question but I am super new to thinking about money and actually planning things out so this is a little overwhelming for me right now. 

edit: One of the reasons I'm really cautious about savings is that I'm a single mom and work in a field that can be unstable although I've worked in my current job for almost 6 years now so I don't foresee anything chaning  in the near future. But realistically if anything were to happen I'm the only provider and my savings would be the only thing keeping us afloat.",finance,1445530571

personalfinance,Borrowing a significant chunk to go back to school. Crazy/not crazy?,"Hey everyone, I love reading this sub and was curious for a bit of advice on my current plans.

I'm a 29 y/o Registered Nurse working in the PNW.  I currently make ~ 80,000 a year working 36 hrs a week and with a few extra shifts here and there that bumps to 90 (I've managed as much as 100 but that was not a good year...).

Currently my only debts are the remainder of my mortgage (148K @ 3.125%) and my old student loans (~27k @ 4-6%)

I'm planning on going back to school for CRNA (Nurse Anesthetist) in the next year or two.  However the program is very expensive (90,000 tuition alone), its also more than full time for 27-36 months and many programs will not allow you to work or allow very little work on the side.

So my current plan to finance this trip back to school is to use a home equity line of credit and additional student loans.  With the equity available on my house and the federal student loans available I can more than cover this trip; but I'm a bit hesitant about taking on all this extra debt.  All told I estimate I'll be borrowing ~150k by the time I'm done.

My salary should initially jump to 110-120k/year and then grow with experience to about 180-200k here in the northwest.  I think this salary increase, especially the growth with experience, warrants going back sooner vs later even if it means taking on debt... but I'm curious to hear your thoughts?

TLDR:  Taking out loans to increase earning potential in healthcare work, good idea, bad idea?

Edit point 1:  I should add I am the statistical minority in nursing male!  But no offense taken, my BSN class was 77 women and 3 men...

Edit point 2:  I didn't mention it previously but I have some savings I'm taking into account above the 150k.  I have ~15k currently saved beyond my protected retirement accounts.  I hope to have that number closer to 30k by the time I actually quit and start school.  Unfortunately several of my program options are in very high cost of living areas (DC, southern Cali) Oregon (My home state) has the lowest cost city (Portland) that I'm applying to this year so I'm planning ~30k a year minimum living expenses (I hope I'm overestimating but I don't intend to not have enough funds available).

personalfinance,Can't get any more cc's-keep getting denied only have 1 with full time employment,"OK personal finance I've been doing a lot of reading over the past few weeks and am trying to build credit.i graduated college earlier this year and am working my first real job. I make 63k a year and have plenty of money saved in the bank.  I currently have a capital one card with a 300 limit and an amazon store card with a 1300 credit limit. I've had the amazon card for a couple years and use it almost every month. I've only ever had one late payment and it was made 2 days after being due.  The capital one I've had less than a month and had to have it switched due to fraudulent charges. STill waiting on the replacement. When I was younger I opened a Macy's charge with my mom as a Co user well she used it and didn't pay it on time but that has been closed out for about 4 years now. I've been buying things with cash and my Debi card for years and just never needed a credit card. Well now in the real world everyone cares about credit scores. While searching for apartments with my girlfriend we were turned down multiple times for credit history. I've applied for numerous cards and always get rejected. I know this hurts my score a bit but I need more credit cards. I'm a decent saver and know how to budget money properly and make enough of it to live comfortably. But I keep getting denied even through my bank who've I've been with for about 10 years and never over drafted or had less than 10k in my savings. I have 0 debt and no car payments. I plan on buying a new car within a year or 2 and want a decent credit score to get a good interest rate. My current score is about 650 according to capital one which is about average apparently. I cannot get approved for any of the other cards I've tried for. I've tried discover it chase freedom and a plethora of others. I personally don't like the idea of secured credit cards because of them holding your money. I tried multiple store cards when I was being my new TV and ended up getting shot down. I have learned it's not as good for your score to pay off balances before the statement which I have almost always done with the amazon card. But now I will wait for the statements to generate. Sorry for the wall of text but I'm trying to give the full story. What else can I do to build my credit or get another card. Should I just keep using what I have and pay it off or are there other cards I've missed with less strenuous approvals. I'm still relatively new to the idea of using credit card but I know how to use them responsibly. It's just mind boggling to me that someone with a good job, 0 debt, and plenty of money in the bank can't get approved for any cards. While others crippled by debt or transfer debt constantly between credit cards who are obviously not financially responsible can't get approved no problem.

Insurance Totalled a car of mine that was in an accident (other party's fault) so I needed a replacement.  Knowing I would be in the market to finance a car I took the advice from this sub and went to my Credit Union to get financed for no more than 20K, I've banked with them since day one.  Factoring my income and my fiance's the payment was well within our budget.  My credit history only encompasses Credit Cards for 6 years with only 1 late payment b/c of BofA's stupid automatic pay system(5 months prior).  Other than that, I've been a solid lendee.  The associate there figured my likliness of getting a loan wasn't that high becuase of my credit history being so single sided (only CC's) and gave me worst case sceanario.  A couple days later he called me back and gave me an interest rate of 5.69% for 60 months. That's not a bad rate for an average customer on a used car, though I found it to be very high considering my credit, so I said I'd call them if I needed the loan.  


A few days later I found a used car at a big dealership that wasn't on the lot yet advertised for $12,995.  Talked the car down to $11,500 and was ready to sign papers(Note, I found out later they purchased the car for $9,500 from the trade in agreement, I could have negociated more, but the car never touched the lot and went straight from inspection to me, so calculate to see avg profit on used cars).  When I got ready to go to financing, I asked them to see what they could get me and they came back with 3.49% at the same terms, Chase Bank being the lender. Did I take their offer, Hell Yea.  Did my bank call and ask about the loan a week later? Yes, and I told them I got a better rate through Chase.  Am I mad? No, because the lending game is just like insurance, they evaluate your risk and calculate their reward.  That's why you hear of some people getting 0% rates from their banks on small loans; the bank sees you've been a customer of theirs for a while and you have/have had a big loan with us, so we'll take care of this small one you want, maybe you'll come back to us with another big loan and we'll do business then.

But the guy was such a fast talker and poo-pooed the idea so much that I frankly don't trust a word he says. 

What's the straight dope folks? I'm not interested in how bad an idea it is. I just want to know how it's done and the best way to do it. This house is too good for me to let go.

Thanks! I appreciate any and all advice!

Edit: Thanks again everyone for the advice. As some have said I don't have a new 401k to roll it into and I can't take a loan on it since I am no longer employed there. So the answer is to roll it into a Roth IRA and use the first time home buyer exception to eliminate the 10% early withdrawal penalty. Trouble is the company that manages the stupid thing says I can't do that. Gotta get someone on the phone there that knows what they're talking about. 

Again, I'm not worried about losing this 401k because I have a good retirement setup going. Thanks for the concerns though!",finance,1445547000
personalfinance,$90k Student Loan Debt Question,"Hello all. Question concerning my student loan debt and current financial position. I will try to give as much information as possible in the most succinct fashion. I currently have $90k of student loan debt from grad school. I have no other debts (CC, mortgage, etc.) I max out my 401k and Roth IRA and target an additional liquid savings of $1,500 a month (Rainy Day fund). I will be getting married in June of 2016 and the plan is to have kids, buy a home and all of that good stuff about a year or two after we are married. I currently make $120k a year (I know poor me), but honestly have worked very hard to get to this point in my career. 
I would like to be debt free by the time we purchase a home and start having kids, thus I need to pay off my student loans in roughly 2.5 years or less. Based on this, I would have to make payments of around $2800 a month based on my current interest rate and principal balance. I'm currently on a 10 year payback schedule, so $2800 a month would mean a $1700 incremental increase per month over what I'm currently paying on my loans. Question being, should I taper back what I am saving or contributing to my 401k to meet this goal? I'm not too fond of the idea because I think there is a huge opportunity cost associated with this. I think the better alternative would be to cut back on what I am saving after tax each month. I currently have roughly $15k in cash savings and two insurance policies with a cash value of around $18k. Would it be a smart decision to surrender those policies and apply them to my student loan debt? I don't have any current dependents, but I'm thinking that since I will be getting married soon it would be a good idea to hang on to those. I want to make sure I'm traveling down the right path. I know that my student loan debt should be treated as an ""Emergency"", but I just want to make sure I'm making the right decisions for my future. Thank you in advance for all of the insight and I will provide additional information upon request.",finance,1445547353

If you haven't heard, Experian's servers containing T-Mobile customer data was hacked

The official statement is:

* On Sept. 15, 2015 **Experian discovered an unauthorized party accessed T-Mobile data housed in an Experian server.**
* Experian's consumer credit database was not accessed in this incident, and no payment card or banking information was obtained.
* Based on Experian’s investigation to date, the unauthorized access was an isolated incident over a limited period of time. It included access to a server that contained identifying information for some organizations and, primarily, personal information for individuals, including some current customers, and also consumers who applied for T-Mobile USA postpaid service or device financing, which require a credit check, from Sept. 1, 2013 through Sept. 16, 2015.
* Records containing a **name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, identification number (typically a driver’s license, military ID, or passport number) and additional information used in T-Mobile's own credit assessment were accessed.** No payment card or banking information was obtained.
* Experian notified appropriate federal and international law enforcement agencies and has taken additional security steps to help prevent future incidents.
* We continue to investigate the theft, closely monitor our systems, and work with domestic and international law enforcement. Investigation of the incident is ongoing.
* Experian is notifying the individuals who may have been affected and is offering free credit monitoring and identity resolution services for two years. In addition, government agencies are being notified as required by law.
* Although there is no evidence at this time that the data has been used inappropriately, Experian strongly encourages affected individuals to enroll in the complimentary identity resolution services.

So needless to say I'm absolutely pissed. I mean whoever is responsible for the hack has all of my personal information forever. I got a pretty empty letter from Experian which in no way helps my situation. It basically says:

* To help protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary two-year membership of Experian’s
ProtectMyID Alert. At no cost to you, this product helps detect possible misuse of your personal
information and provides you with superior identity protection services focused on immediate identification
and resolution of identity theft. 

Later in their statement they advise to ""Consider placing a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit file.""

**1) Any other advice as to what I can do will be greatly appreciated!**

**2) Should I apply for the ProtectMyID service?** I mean it's free but how can I trust a company that already screwed up so bad.

Bitcoin,"Gavin Andresen presents his take on the newly formed ""Blockchain Alliance""","**Gavin Andresen:**

&gt; There has always been a split among bitcoiners on how best to interact with regulators and law enforcement.

&gt; There is the ""ignore them, they're illegitimate. Honey Badger don't care"" side.

&gt; And there's the ""engage them, educate them, show them the positive benefits to balance the negatives that are, otherwise, probably the only thing they see"" side.

&gt; I still think engaging is the best strategy. Yes, there will be more failures like the BitLicense, but overall I think every positive interaction with law enforcement or regulators helps move opinions from ""Bitcoin is Evil and must be eliminated"" towards ""Bitcoin is an innovative technology that should be allowed to grow.""

&gt; And no, I don't think ""we"" will compromise the technology or our deeply held beliefs because we interact with ""them.""

&gt; At least, I know I won't. If you are worried that talking to the FBI about the latest version of CryptoLocker might corrupt your morals, then great-- nobody will twist your arm to participate.

**Bruce Fenton's response:**

&gt; I agree with Gavin that engagement is preferable. I've met many regulators and had some productive conversations...particularly globally. The regulators in Massachusetts for example are pretty reasonable to speak with.

&gt; I was not a fan of engaging with Lawsky because I think he had bad faith.

&gt; My concern with this new Blockchain Alliance is that the agencies have generally bad track records and also, they are not lawmakers or regulators...just enforcers. So no amount of convincing will get them to relax, consider or change policy.

&gt; A couple examples: Fed enforcement agencies target legal pot businesses in Colorado, despite Colorado voters deciding this should not be criminal.

&gt; Another example: the DHS/ TSA was recently involved in prosecution of a gay male prositution ring in NYC. This is a massive stretch from anything which could be claimed to ""protect us from terrorism"" and the type of thing which would be harmful if these agencies want Bitcoin traced and tracked for this purpose.

&gt; I [have] many members of law enforcement in my family. They are generally hard working, good people. But above all else they follow orders and the code is more based on chain of command than a moral code.

&gt; I know very little about the program / alliance overall -- hopefully I'm wrong.

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans--confirm I am not dumb.,"Hello Personal Finance!

I am currently planning on refinancing a number of student loans and would like a quick confirmation that this isn't a bad idea.

Loans: I have approximately a dozen loans from law school and undergraduate studies.

* total balance: $102,000

* interest rates: 5%-7.9%. Dollar weighted average, approximately 7.2%

* time to payoff: about eight years.

* monthly payments: $1,492 total.

Personal situation: I have approximately $130K in savings, and another $35K in a 401K. I have a job making approximately $170K/year. I'm currently renting and saving up for a down payment. Aside from student loans, I also owe approximately $24K on a loan for my Subaru, paying $440/mo at 2.49% interest.

Refinance opportunity: a local bank is offering me a personal loan to repay my student loans of $80,000 at 2.75% interest fixed for ten years. I will pay off the remaining 22K. The expected payment is $763/mo.

One catch is that if I don't maintain a direct deposit account, my interest rate goes up 5%.

Downsides that I have already weighed and accepted are:

* slightly longer repayment period.

* loss of student loan perks like income based repayment

* punishing conditions if I lose my current job.

Overall, I'm pretty excited for this opportunity, but if anyone has serious qualms, please offer a critique.

Edit: there is no prepayment penalty.",finance,1445555064
personalfinance,Student Debt payoff questions,"First time posting in this sub, looking for some advice. Reading through the FAQ's it essentially said that paying off (high interest rate) loans comes before putting any $ into an IRA. However my employer does not offer 401k (very small office). I do have some high interest rate student loans ~$90k with $20k of it at 6.74%. I have ~$20k combined in my checking and savings account. Should I put everything above my emergency fund (I set at $10k) into that loan? You always hear ""start saving early"" but in this scenario (hopefully have new job in 6-12 months) I don't start saving for retirement until age 27? 28? I had read that loan refinancing is possible, but don't know if its worthwhile/ if I qualify for it. I have been taking a beginners invinst online course but reading through this makes it seem like the investing isn't something I should be concerned with right now. 

This may be a dumb question, but is there a reason you shouldn't use a cash back credit card to pay off these types of loans (obviously pay the CC balance immediately so no interest is charged)? If you get 1% of each each $1,200 monthly payment it really adds up. Is there a fee associated with this type of payment or will it reflect poorly (even if the payment is &lt; 30% of your credit line) on your credit score?

I'm 23, ~1.5 yrs out of college, making $54k/yr before tax, live in a relatively cheap area (rent + utilities &lt; $600). The sum of my loan payments is minimum ~$900/month and I'm paying $1200/month. My credit is 731 (based on credit karma scores). 
Also I recently discovered that Fedloan direct debit will not put all extra payment towards the highest interest rate loan (if you have multiple). You would have to pay the minimum on all loans with direct debit and do a separate payment for the specific loan.",finance,1445561594

Last dollar scholarships cover cover all necessary student fees not including laundry, sorority dues, etc. as well as room and board and whatever else needs to be payed. We are not allowed to do federal work studies as it would take time away from our studies. 

This fall their payment was $12,516, $2,175 of which was a living stipend for me to cover books, supplies, transportation, the occasional pizza, a blazer for an interview, really whatever we may need. At the end of this calendar year I will have $2,075 left over because I bought all my books used on Amazon and didn't keep receipts of school supplies.

personalfinance,"My parents make good money, but don't seem to be saving a lot of money. Mom asked me for help, so I am asking you.","Hi Reddit,

Looking forward to some advice I can share with my parents here. Its all the data I could provide, please help.

Their situation: My mother and step-father live in a somewhat expensive county in California. They have good jobs and don't seem to spend a lot of money given their income situation.

Earnings:
Mom (50) is a teacher who normally makes about $75K a year, but is working part time this year ($45K) to do school. She is getting her masters that will pay her a guaranteed $2K more a year and allow her to obtain higher paying administrative jobs, though she is taking on 15K of debt for this.

Step Father (60) is probably making $140 a year (This is just an estimate, but I think within reason). He is a partner at a small law firm. He just become a partner and has to invest $10K a year for the next 4-8 years in order to pay for his partnership. (I know this range is large range in terms of year, but I am mostly concerned with the monthly rate)

They normally maybe get 150K a year post tax. So 12.5K a year post tax. This year they are getting 10K a month post tax maybe.
 
Assets:

House, maybe worth $650K, they probably have 30% off this paid off. It is in a suburb that is increasing in value.

Stepdad-
140K in a retirement fund - He got screwed at an investment fund that only made him $5K over the last 14 years (That seriously seems like they stole his money. He should have doubled his savings, or at least kept up with inflation, any advice here. The new financial advisor he signed wants to charge him 1% a year to manage his assets, which seems decent, but I want to get your advice. He gets two financial visits a year from this.)
Maybe 25K in cash or liquid assets
Owns part of his law firm, and is purchasing more as part of his partnership deal.

Mom-
$40K in retirement - She raised my brother and myself single for most of my childhood, and didn't do a lot to save
Maybe 4000K in cash or liquid assets

Two cars: About 10 years old each, but in pretty good shape. They take good care of their cars, and I think they will last a while.

Debt:

House. $650K house they have probably paid 30% of. Bought at height of housing bubble, for about $30K less.

Mom - tops 45K in student debt, including the loans she took out for her recent education, which she will finish in the spring. Maybe 2K in credit card debt

Step Dad: None that I could think of, though my step-brother is getting married next sprint, so my parents will probably spend $2K on that at least.

My estimate of their expenses per Month: 8.5K
3.6K a month in mortgage (at a variable interest rate, they are moving it to a fixed interest rate soon i hope)
$600 (Utilities, house maintenance, Cell Phones, house insurance)
$1.4K Food and Outings
$500 Transportation - Bus, Commute, plus insurance, plus gas
$150 clothes
$400 on health insurance (The school district claims to pay $700 dollars, and only subsidizes $300. Does that not seem high?)
$500 moms student debt

Expenses by year: 7K (This amount doesn't seem unreasonable)
3K per year in vacation
1.5K at Christmas on gifts food and events.
1K on birthday gifts
$1.5K Sports tickets + associated costs

Total Estimated Monthly Rate: 9.3K

I know they are not in the best situation, but I think their combined income gives them a lot of room to grow. Obviously things will change when my mom goes back to working full time, and things will get better when my stepdad pays off his partnership.

I know they have made many past financial mistakes, and I am looking for advise on how to better their financial situation in the future.",finance,1445574666
personalfinance,"(US) IRS Transcripts: What are they, and how can I get mine?","There are five transcript types for federal tax purposes:

**Tax Return Transcript** - This shows most line items from your tax return (Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ) as it was originally filed, including any accompanying forms and schedules. This transcript doesn’t show account changes made after the return is processed. A return transcript usually meets the requirements of lending institutions offering mortgages and student loans. This transcript will show changes made during IRS processing if a line item is changed by the Service. This transcript is generally available for the current tax year and the three prior tax years. Late-filed returns processed within the last three years *may* be available.

**Tax Account Transcript** - This shows basic return data including return type, filing status, adjusted gross income, taxable income, credits and payments. It also shows adjustments made by you or the IRS after you filed the return, such as a change made by an amended return, an examination, or an underreported income case. If you made estimated tax payments and/or applied your overpayment from a prior year tax return to your current year tax return, you can use this transcript to confirm these payments or credits a few weeks after the beginning of the calendar year prior to filing your current year return. This is an excellent record of payments made on an Installment Agreement. This transcript type is generally available for all tax years filed under a given SSN. The codebook used to identify the transactions listed on the tax account transcript is the [Document 6209](https://www.irs.gov/portal/site/irspup/menuitem.143f806b5568dcd501db6ba54251a0a0/?vgnextoid=0093bbe332f0c410VgnVCM1000003b4d0a0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=21c31c39af0c6310VgnVCM10000024150a0a____&amp;vgnextfmt=default)

**Record of Account** - This combines the information from both the tax account and tax return transcripts. This transcript is generally available for the current tax year and the three prior tax years. Late-filed returns processed within the last three years *may* be available.

**Wage and Income Transcript** - These transcripts shows data from information returns reported to the IRS, such as W-2s, 1099s and 1098s. Current tax year information may not be complete until July, and they begin processing on IRS computers beginning in April. These transcripts are generally available for a total of ten years. For example, the database currently stores record for 2005 through 2014. When the 2015 wage and income documents begin to process, the 2005 documents will be deleted, and then 2006 will be the oldest available records. Federal transcripts **do not** show any state wage and withholding data.

**Verification of Non-filing Letter** - This letter is proof from the IRS that you didn’t file a return for a given year. Current year requests aren’t available until after June 15. This letter doesn’t address whether you, the taxpayer, are required to file a tax return for a given tax year. A taxpayer may fail to file a tax return even though he/she is required to do so. This letter is available for the current year and the three prior years.

1) At what point does interest start accumulating? After something like a month? And how does it work? If my interest rate is like 15%, does that just all tack on all at once if I don't pay it back in time, or does the interest add on over a period of time?

2) Can I pay what I owe online to Huntington, or do I need to write checks?

3) If I pay the minimum every month, can I technically pay them back indefinitely without worrying about some sort of repercussion? As in, if I always owe them money but I keep up on at least my minimum payments, will I always be okay?

personalfinance,The oldest credit card I have is terrible. Should I close it despite the fact that I've had it forever?,"So I've had a credit card from 1st Financial Bank that I got around 2005/6. It was the first one I ever got. It started with a $250 limit and, over the years, grew to a $13,300 limit. I used it on/off in high school just to have a credit record of some kind. Once I went to college, it had a $7000 limit and I held onto it just in case I had some sort of emergency. Luckily, I never did.

&amp;nbsp;

So, now that I've been out of college for almost 3 years, I haven't used it. I actually got a credit card through my bank (TD Bank) about a year ago. That card at least gets me points that I can turn into cash back (1% on everything). The limit is $3,000. I've never inquired about raising it. The interest rate isn't awful, but I never rotate a balance anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

The card from 1FBUSA has no rewards, no points, a terrible interest rate (29.9%), and a yearly fee of $55.

personalfinance,Choosing terms on auto loan - considering I have a higher rate student loan outstanding (but deferred),"I have the budget of **$637 a month set aside either way** to pay off both of these debts, and I'm trying to maximize that money across these two loans.
 
**Auto Loan Details:**
 
Principle: $13,200 (beginning November 2015)

*  Option 1: 48 months, 2.64 interest rate, payment of $290.08/month
*  Option 2: 60 months, 2.74 interest rate, payment of $235.66/month
*  Option 3: 72 months, 3.24 interest rate, payment of $201.98/month
*  Option 4: 84 months, 3.84 interest rate, payment of $179.46/month.
 
**Student Loan Details:**
 
Principle: $26,634 (as of November 2015)(Deferred min payment until January 2018 - when that starts my rate will be $30,206)

* 120 months, 6.8% interest rate, (after deferment period) payment of $347.62/month.
 
So, with my consistent amount of capital of $637 a month, **which option for an auto loan should I choose?** I know that any leftover capital after my auto loan I should put toward my student loan. (so, with the $179.46 payment, I would put the remaining against student loans, even though the student loan is deferred). I'm having a lot of trouble with all of the moving parts and the financial calculators, especially with dealing with the deferment and the different options. Also, I would be fine (happy) to pay both of these down with additional payments if that wasn't clear. My last car loan I payed off in 32 months despite being a 60 month term.

Could I get some feedback?","I've only recently discovered reddit and have really enjoyed reading through the PF sub and have found it super motivating to really crunch down and take care of my debt. I've been working on it for awhile but haven't really knuckled down on my spending. That ends now!


A break down of my debt:


Capital One Venture One: $2200 (0% interest until 9/2016)

Discover: $2400 (22%)

Citi Diamond: $880 (19%)

Amex Everyday: $1000 (0% interest until 8/2016)

Chase Slate: $400 (0% interest until 11/2015, will be paid off on 10/30)

Car Loan: $9000 (10%, $216/month)

Student Loans: $60/month (6.8%, 4.5%, and two at 4.29%) 
I have $13k total, all federal, currently in deferment while I'm in school. I pay the interest accrued on the unsubsidized loans plus a bit of principle each month to avoid capitalized interest when I graduate.


Expenses: 

Insurance: $130/month

Food/Gas/Misc: $200

Credit card payments: $186 to cover minimum payments on all cards

Rent is $700/month with all utilities included. I'm located close to work and for the area I'm in (NoVA) I actually pay a really great rate.


I plan on setting aside $200/pay period for that general category for a few reasons. Gas is generally only $20/week thanks to a short commute and general lack of a social life, I have Netflix for $10/month, Spotify (which I'm thinking about cancelling) for $10/month, and I don't generally have many other expenses as a bachelorette. My biggest vice is eating out. When I was waiting tables and poorer than dirt I ate a lot of pasta and grilled cheese so when I got a ""real job"" I started rewarding myself. That's going to be the biggest place for me to cut costs.

I work a 9-5 full time job and bring home $980 after tax every pay period. I've almost completed my registration to start driving for Uber part time to make a little extra money. I intend to set 30% of all income from Uber aside for taxes and the remainder after cost of gas is going to go to building a $1k emergency fund. I'd try and get a more 'stable' income part time job but with my full time job and class schedule, it isn't really an option for me.

Considering I was at one point (2009 I'm looking at you) up to almost $13k in CC debt, and $3k in medical debt, I'm much happier with where I am, but I still get stressed if I think too hard about all this.


My current plan is this:

1) Pay all CC debt off. After I pay off the Slate card I'll be attacking the others in order of highest to lowest interest.

1.5) Start building $1k emergency fund. This will start as soon as I begin my Uber job, which will go towards the EF until I've met $1k. Then the income will be rolled over to CCs/car.

2) Start contributing max match to 401k through my employer. This will require some research as I'm not quite sure how to set it up and what the exact match figures are.

3) Pay off car. 

4) Bulk up my emergency fund to 6 months of expenses.

5) Begin hitting student loans, starting with the highest interest rates. 


This is definitely subject to change, but I wanted to see what you all thought of it. My student loan total is going to increase as I'm still in school, but the excess amount after tuition that gets disbursed to me definitely helps with living expenses, leaving me to put more of my income towards my debt.

Some background: I've been living in Maryland for a bit over 2 years and my wife has been here for over a year. For almost this entire duration, we've rented out condo's. An opportunity to buy a 2BR condo for $120k recently became available and it's extremely enticing.

My wife (24) works for the Federal government making ~55k/yr, with this position growing to 70k within the next 3 years. I (25) work for a government contractor and am making 105k/yr, although I'm still fairly junior and there's potential for growth.

We currently rent a 2BR condo in the same building and it's considered a steal at $1500/mo, as most 2BR's go for about 1600-1800/mo.

We have about $25k available in our joint savings and $15k in our Roth IRAs (which we were using to save potential house money - we also have 401k's, but we'd prefer not to touch those). My wife has another $20k in her personal account that may be available.

I'm unsure of how much the condo fee is, but I know it includes water, heat, and electric, and is at least $600/month.

We have two cars paid off and do not foresee needing to buy another for at least a few years. We have no debts.

Does purchasing this condo sound like a good idea? The combined mortgage + interest + condo fee would likely be less than our rent, besides that we'd be building equity throughout. Since it's a condo, we should only need to pay for smaller repairs, which significantly lowers our risk.

What are the important questions to ask the current residents, owner, and condo association? We're friendly with the current residents and know a few other families that purchased their own condos, so we have plenty of people we can get info from, we just need to know what to ask.

personalfinance,"Mid 30's, 58k joint income, family of 3, major debt, cancer diagnosis, holding on financially but barely, please help","Hi guys. This is my first Reddit post, so, apologies ahead of time for any newbie mistakes.   

Long story short, my husband makes 42k a year, I bring in 16k annual in SSD.   We have a toddler who is 2, I currently stay home with him (no day care cost).  I was working until 2 years ago, when I was diagnosed with stage IV cancer and had to turn down my good paying dream job to have surgery and treatment (I accepted the offer 2 hours before the tumor was discovered).   I am currently still getting treatment, but am NED at the moment, thank goodness.   I am currently applying to jobs, as I feel a little better and might be able to work, but, no one is calling me back, most likely due to a 2 year gap of employment that isn't explained on the resume, even though I have my MS. 

On to our finances-  We didn't have great insurance when I was first diagnosed.   Between the birth of our child and my diagnosis, treatment, surgery, etc, we racked up over 20k in medical bills, but friends and family had a fundraiser that helped pay for a lot of that, but we still have some lingering bills.  We are now on much better insurance, but still have ongoing medical bills b/c I am still in treatment and get multiple scans every 3 months.

On to finances- we have a lot of CC debt and student loans, in addition to medical bills.   Here is a summary break down...

Medical bills (250pm payment plan) (~5000 left, no interest, about 500 added on annual due to copayments, deductible, etc)

CC and home improvement LOC (~1000pm min payment) (about 25k total, interest rates ranging from 10%-25%).  (No excuse for CC debt, just lots of stupid mistakes over the course of 10 years)

Student loans -(0pm, currently on income driven payment plan with 0$ payment due to low AGI) (35k balance) 

Living expenses (1600 pm, including rent, cell phone, Internet, utilities, and food for 3)

Auto (400 pm for 1 car + insurance for 2 cars)   (One car is paid off, one car only has less than 2k left and will be paid off in 5mos).  Both cars in good shape and should last another 3-4 years (knock on wood). 

Additional income:  

We own a house, with about 45k equity in it currently.   We have been renting it out for the past 3 years, as we planned to move across the country for my new job before I was diagnosed.  The rent covers just enough to pay for the mortgage and all financed home repairs we are still paying off (it's an older home and all the major appliances went haywire about a year ago and needed replaced).   

I just got my real estate license, but, haven't made any money from that yet, but hopefully it will be potential income in the future that won't require daycare.

So.... That is the summary.  I know this is long and not very organized, but I'm basically looking for any advice at all on how to tackle this debt with limited income.    I'm not currently worried about retirement.  I know I should be, but that is the last of my worries right now.    My biggest worry is leaving my son and husband with this debt if things turn south again.   We have cashed out a few retirement accounts to pay medical bills, but are hanging onto a few of them.   We have already cut back on eating out (having a 2 year old helps with that!!), cut back on groceries, going out of any sort, got rid of cable.   I try to make a very detailed budget and stay with it, but somehow we always get off track.    

We are considering selling our house next spring to help us get back on track.   Do you all think this would be a smart move?  We have the potential to make 40-50k.   We could use that to pay off a lot of debt.  I know we should hang onto some for a down payment on our next home, but honestly, I am not comfortable buying another house for another few years until I am NED for longer, plus, I doubt we could get a mortgage with our current debt (although some how our credit is actually average/good).    

Also, I have started looking into those debt consolidation programs, but don't know enough about them to trust it.  I get lots of offers in the mail for that.  Good idea or bad?

Since May I started earning my own money with a waiter/hotel job on the weekends. **I have €0 debt** because of the Belgian school system not being that expensive (used to be €700/year) and my parents/grandfather helping me out financially for the biggest part. (I'm incredibly grateful for this)

My parents don't save, we live month to month and I have come to the conclusion that I don't want that kind of life myself in the future. I still live with them as of now. (Great people but uneducated about money)

Growing up, my idea of ""saving"" was stacking up some cash and then buying something big with it (like a game or box of LEGOs), effectively resetting my bank account back to 0. (AKA not saving)

**Since I started earning money, I've been able to save up €500**, though my spending has also increased, partially because now that I have my own job, I pay my own shoes, clothes, haircuts, food when eating out, school more and more, etc. (Understandably, just growing up I guess)

[Current Stats](http://i.imgur.com/pOX9sHi.png)

I went on a vacation in Juli, September had a lot of school related purchases/payments and this month (October) I've had to pay a sports membership and buy new gear as well.

A big chunk of the ""income"" and expenses on my account is actually me paying for a school-related purchase and my parents paying it back eventually (or partially), this accounts for a few hundred of the total. Same thing goes for me paying something for a friend, and them paying me back eventually, so the actual income and expenditure is pretty inaccurate. Though the ""Difference over this period"" is spot on.

Even when I neglect this information, **I managed to save about 16% of my income**. Great start if I can say so myself!

That's about everything there is to my current financial situation. I take the public transport and bike, so no car loans/costs. I am disciplined at school and very career driven, lots of options, some unique qualities in my field and a pretty impressive portfolio already. I'm sure of my ability to land a medium to high-paying job once I start out. (Among the top of my class, already had offers)

As far as my savings/investments go, **my current savings account of €526.07 has a 0.10-0.20% yearly interest rate** as of now. This is BAD.
I was wondering what my best course of action would be, seeing there isn't much to be found on here about Belgian banking/investing? The best savings accounts have about 1.50% interest rate so I could switch banks/accounts.

More importantly... Seeing all this money, and knowing that I don't earn BIG yet with this small weekend job. **Would you advise me to keep saving at this rate, save more, or will it just be negligible once I have a real job?**

My current plan would be to keep the €500 as a crisis budget as long as I'm in school, and spend the rest on travels, sports, instruments and concerts. But **I'm not sure how much this course of action would determine the rest of my financial life and set back my financial potential?**

politics,"The ""Misanthropists"" and ""Misosophers"" of the GOP.","The words ""philanthropy"" and ""philosophy"" have a common root, ""phil,"" meaning love: Philanthropy is thus love of humankind, and philosophy love of knowledge.  

While the Republican Party in general has not exactly been a paragon of either virtue in more than a century, it's only in the last few decades that it has become cancerously hateful toward them.  So much so that we have to invent a word that doesn't even exist yet in English because it's so preposterous: **Misosophy**, the hatred of knowledge - and call the bizarre creatures that practice it ""misosophers.""

Now, ""misnathropy"" and ""misanthropic"" are already well-known words, but for the most part they have just meant cynical curmudgeons, not dedicated practitioners of an ideology of deliberate violence against the most basic underpinnings of civilization.  To describe what is going on in the Republican Party, we must create a strange modification: **Misanthropist**.  In the same way that a philanthropist is a person who works determinedly to advance the human condition, a misanthropist works with equal vigor to debase humankind.

&gt; [""I'm not a scientist.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_not_a_scientist)  -Public boast by multiple Republican leaders, including nearly all current GOP presidential candidates.

When you have a Party that uses *majorities* in the United States Congress to do things like [this](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/gop-war-on-science-gets-worse); when it uses power mostly gotten through [gerrymandering](http://billmoyers.com/2014/11/05/gerrymandering-rigged-2014-elections-republican-advantage/), legalized [bribery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC), and in some cases outright [election theft](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/florida-voter-purge-illegal-court) to wage an unceasing War on Science and on the basic functions of the United States federal government; we are left grasping for words to describe the obscenity.

Rather than flail at such absolute moral freefall with exhausted terms like ""ignorant,"" ""know-nothing,"" ""corrupt,"" ""liar,"" and ""criminal,"" we are left to at last to the realization that it's more fundamental than laziness, cynicism, and inability to abide by the rules of behavior that intelligent people over the age of 12 just understand instinctively.  It's much, much worse than that.

Everything that gets in their way - be it a specific government program, or the entire concept of government itself - they determine to be their enemy, and seek to destroy it.  But now they've reached a moment of ideological clarity, realizing that it's not just individual facts that are obstacles to their agenda, but the very idea of knowledge.  Not just liberal over-enthusiasm for a ""nanny state"" as they once saw it that is the problem, but the entire concept of benevolent action toward other human beings.

In this upside-down, morally inverted Orwellian psychosis of Republican politics, it is not they who govern least that govern best (as even the older generation of right-wing radicals would have had it), but they who govern with the greatest **malice**.  They who have it in their hearts to actively seek the sabotage and destruction of the purpose for which their offices exist, and the people they are sworn to serve.

Beside the philanthropists who raise money for humankind, we now have these misanthropists who raise money to see it brought low into slavery and violence.  Beside philosophers who adore truth and always seek to expand knowledge, we have misosophers who seek the undoing of knowledge already obtained, denying science already settled and replacing it by force and fraud with outright lies.

So don't ever accuse Republicans of never doing anything novel, because they have gone so far off the Deep End that they are changing the definition of Deep End on a daily basis.  Such escalating spirals of madness, hate, and violent fantasy-mongering rarely turn out well for the host countries forced to deal with them.",technology,1445664350

I'm making $20/h at about 38 hours a week, getting paid weekly. I work a normal M-F 8-5 work week (minus ~ 2 hours per week due to outside obligations). $20/h X 38 h/week is $760/week gross.

financialindependence,Quit federal job for a bit more money?,"Due to some frustrations at work, I recently put out my resume. However the main interest came from companies that directly contract with the place I work (and some also contract for other agencies). At this point it looks like my primary options are to essentially do my job either as a civilian or a contractor. I get $85,000 a year as a government employee, and I can make at least $110,000 as a contractor. Benefits look really comparable except the federal job offers a pension, which for most people is an amazing benefit. As someone looking to retire by 40 though, I'm not sure how much I should care about the pension since it doesn't start getting indexed to inflation until you start drawing it at typical retirement age. The annual benefit at retirement is calculated as 1% for every year of work * the average of your top 3 years salary--which I believe also aren't indexed to inflation--so the pension seems notably nice to people planning on drawing a salary in the years immediately preceding retirement, but not so much for people planning to retire 20+ years before ""retirement age"". There is also the issue of job security, as it's almost unheard of to be laid off in a bad fiscal environment as a government employee, but that's exactly what happens to contractors.

Bitcoin,"Friends: the Blockchain Alliance isn't a debate over whether we should engage government or not, It's about whether this particular form of engagement is helpful or harmful","It's great to see more people discussing the Blockchain Alliance.

There are some great people involved in the alliance.

In discussing concerns and questions, common defenses of the program are ""we should engage lawmakers"", ""without legitimacy Bitcoin will not thrive"" or ""it's naive to think law enforcement won't be involved"".

These points are a false dichotomy.

This isn't an argument, at least for me and others, of isolation verus engagement, of mainstream versus underground or of whether to cooperate with regulators or not.  It's also certainly not an argument of corporate interests versus public interest.

We absolutely should engage with regulators and lawmakers, especially elected officials.  As more large and serious investors and partners enter the space, we absolutely have to upgrade quality standards, compliance and the public image.   Of course, we as an industry should cooperate with government and regulators worldwide and we should educate them and the public.  We also should, of course, look out for corporate interests and help Bitcoin companies succeed.

But this effort doesn't do that.

1) Blockchain Alliance has a stated goal to help groups like the DHS/TSA and ICE (Immigration) ""catch the bad guys"".  Innovators are not cops and should not be.  It is not our job or role to help catch whoever the government wishes to catch.

2) These new partners are NOT regulators and they are not lawmakers.   Of all the people in government we could engage, they may have the most downside with smallest upside.  Enforcement agencies do not make laws and they rarely engage in shaping policy.  These groups can cause massive harm but, best case scenario, it is very unlikely they will help change regulations in favor of Bitcoin.


Let's also be honest here.  While most won't say so out loud, most of us know and agree that these groups have a terrible track record and their idea of ""bad guys"" doesn't always jive with us, morality or even the law and Constitution.

Bitcoin is not all libertarians and shouldn't be.  But how many members of the alliance honestly want to see blockchain records used to track illegal immigrant landscapers who were paid in Bitcoin?  How many want sex workers from Backpage who recently started accepting Bitcoin jailed?  How about Snowden?  How about tracking the Wikileaks Bitcoin donations?  How about legal (yes legal) medical pot sellers in Colorado who the Fed prosecutes despite a mandate from the Colorsdo voters?  

The DHS recently raided the offices of a NY gay men's website which had been online for over 20 years under suspicion of promoting prostitution ....claiming this is in its mission to ""protect the Homeland from terrorists"".  Do the alliance members honestly support this?   Because when alliance members say ""bad guys"" this is exactly who their new partners are talking about.

Suppose someone believes all these acts are good: They want Snowden, suspected prostitutes and raw milk farmers to fill our already full jails.   That opinion is their right.   But we should STILL ask: is this our role to aid in this?  Is this the best use of our time and energy?

Wouldn't it be more effective to focus advocacy efforts on those who's primary role is to make the laws?

If we seek to be mainstream and effective...let's look at what works.  Do we know of any successful examples of this type of alliance that can be modeled?

We know that various tech industry groups engage in several acts to make change:  speaking with lawmakers, testimony, polls, petitions, letters, rallies, lobbyists, protests, boycotts, blogs, media, engaging regulators, grassroots group building and more.   We can easily point to many examples of this.   

By why then are there so very few examples of the companies like Uber, Google, Tesla, Cisco or industry groups partnering with the DHS/TSA, ICE and FBI?   The partnerships are not made because they don't work.  It's not an effective means of advocacy.

Let's take a page from Apple CEO Tim Cook's playbook.  We CAN be mainstream, we can be legal and compliant and we can be cooperative....while also having legal and moral standards and taking a high ground when it comes to human rights and privacy rights.

Tim Cook:  ""I think we would all agree that if there was a way to expose only bad people, whoever the determiner of what bad is, that would be a great thing. But this is not the world.”

To start things off I went ahead and registered over at Credit Karma and checked my credit score. Through 2 different sources they gave me the same score: 750. I'm satisfied with that!

This all took place just about a couple weeks ago. Let's go back in time to March of 2014 when I got myself a new truck. I won't necessarily get into the details of how much and what percentage of the interest rate but I managed to get it financed and to do so I had to put $1,000 down or else the deal was off. 

So now this is where the hard hit inquires come into play. I checked the details of my credit score and how it was affected and noticed my credit took a total of 16 hits between then and now. 12 of which were in a span of 2-3 days! They were listed as such:

Chase Auto	March 15	Bank
Chase Auto	March 15	Credit Union
Culendingsys	March 15	Finance
Dave Sinclair	March 15	Automotive
Fifth Third	        March 15	Bank

Chase Auto	March 17	Bank
Chase Auto	March 17	Credit Union
Fifth Third	        March 17	Bank
WFDS		March 17	Credit Union

It goes by who it was from, the date it was done, and what type of institution they are.

So this is where my thoughts are going to have to come together for this to make sense but I guess after I finished reading through this my question is....is this normal? Or why did this happen so many times in one go? I'm a little ignorant whenever it comes to financing and such but I noticed on my credit report in was in the very poor rank and that caught my attention immediately because over the years of me owning credit cards since I was 18, I'm 23 now, I have been responsible as you could be with a credit card and on the truck loan itself I have never been late on a payment (auto pay).

My work announced it will be shutting down in 2017, with a small chance until 2019. I was told if I stay until the end, I would be looking at a retention bonus of 60-100%, along with a small severance. 

For student loans, I have roughly 90k left at 6.25% interest rate and the loans are all private. I'm on the 10 year plan and paying roughly 1k a month. Car insurance, car and phone bill are my only other bills, other than food and paying around 1.6k total per month. After that, I'm taking home around 2.2k per month after 401k and taxes. My dilemma is sticking it out until they close down and getting the bonus or leaving now and starting at a new job. Other than those bills and student loan, I have no debt. 

If I stick it out, I was told I could not keep my current position and would need a new internal position. I was given two options and both are not interesting to me and not related to my field of study. Basically not be gaining any relevant experience. Might be able to get a different internal position, but that wouldn't be until people start leaving the company within the next 6 months. The good things would be not having to pay rent and being able to save more for my future, especially being able to pay off a big chunk of student loans when I was done. Bad part will be finding a new job after. I'm only a year out of school and feel a year and a half ish of non relevant experience will only hurt me. I would be miserable in whatever position I was in and would only stick around for the money. None of them interest me too much. I'm going to need a new job regardless, it's just a matter of when.
 
The other option would be take a small pay cut and find a new job. Whatever job I find next, I will have to move for. I would be able to get some good experience in the company and be able to get a raise or two in the time I'd be staying at my current job.

I was thinking though that I could increase my 401k to hit the 18k max, and then borrow from the difference (8k x 5 or whenever) when I do buy a house. 

So really, the option is to a) stick my house money into my savings accounts and keep my 401k at 10k per year or B) stick an additional 8k per year into my 401k with the express purpose of being able to borrow from this in several years if I need it for my downpayment. (Obviously there is choice C which is max 401k and not borrow, but I have no fears for my retirement because I know I'll have a sizable inheritance in 30 years when I am of retirement age and I already have 100k, so I am much more concerned about buying a house). I also don't need to put the extra into stocks, I can toss it in safer things, or if things go well, then I don't need to draw it down at all. 

So anyway the question is, is there ANY negative from borrowing against your 401k when you expressly maxed it out for that purpose in previous years (i.e. when your other option was just keeping it in savings accounts).",finance,1445726039

Bitcoin,Why Economists shun bitcoin,"I was talking to a friend of mine who teaches Economics and specialises in macro (governmental-level) policy. His main objection to bitcoin was that 'it's not backed by anything' and he flatly refused my offer to set up a wallet and give him some so he could understand it better. Which got me thinking, why would Homo Economicus refuse an offer of free value? It doesn't make sense, so I've been thinking about it for a few days and here's my postulate.

Advancement in Economics is based on the study of history. In conventional Economics; you need to know about the 1800s, not 18:00 last night.

Secondly Economists are broadly split into two groups, the Keynesians and that 'Hayek lot' as my friend put it. So it is very tribal and likely that both sides stick to their own propaganda in view of the time they have invested and reinforcement bias.

Keynesians don't know that bitcoin poses as much of a challenge to Austrian Regression Theory as it does to Monetarism. Why should they? Most senior Economists are in their 60s and do not want the challenge of addressing new economic theory. They assume, based on past progress, that any new thinking will only be generally adopted long past their retirement so they don't need to bother with it.

Also, that by simply joining the debate (or agreeing to set up a wallet) they will not only lend this idea credence but possibly compromise their reputation if it became known they were a participant and play a small part in a bubble at best or a Ponzi scheme at worst.

You can't hold an argument with a senior Economist about what backs the dollar or the intrinsic value of gold because they just keep dodging the question or repeating a lame answer in the hope you'll agree they are correct. In academia the Professor is correct, by definition so they repeat their position until they run out of patience with your (valid) objections, then tell you you would make a bad pupil!

Here was a senior Economist who can't debate the properties of a money. No wonder the public has invented it's own money. Not a minute too soon! The quality of economic theory and debate on the bitcoin forums is way above anything you will hear in the 'real' world.

Bitcoin is the response to cradle-to-grave debt: the people's money, produced by a self-educated generation with no preconceptions holding them back. Adoption of bitcoin will come first; old-world Economists will have to learn the theory later.

I'm currently making about 27k a year, and I don't feel like I'm ready to buy a house and deal with all the payments. So what I feel I should be doing with the money is to put it into a fund.

With an interest rate of 4%, if I invest 130k right now and I put in an additional 2k per month,  at the end of 5 years I have about $293,000.

personalfinance,How does re-financing student loans affect credit score?,"Hello all,

I have approximately $163k in student loan debt that are in the form of Parent PLUS federal loans with an average interest of about 7%. My father took these loans out for me with the agreement that I would be paying them off after graduation.

So, naturally, after reading about several companies that re-finance loans I urged my father to submit an application to SoFi.

I do not have a degree in the public sector (engineering) so the public service forgiveness option that is attached to federal loans does not apply to me.

I also do not have any plans to default on the loan, so again, having the federal protections is not that big of a concern.

However, even though SoFi is offering a much better rate of around 5%, my father is worried that it will negatively impact his credit score. Since, essentially it is like taking out $160k private loan.

Talking to SoFi, it sounds like they would actually be able to eventually transfer that loan into my name after it has been re-financed. However, I don't think my interest rate would be as low as his, so I would rather he keep it in his name and I continue to pay for it as we've been doing.

Can anyone explain how re-financing these will affect his credit score? Should he be worried or is he right to want to get it off his name and into my name by transferring it through SoFi?

* Knowing that my parents can help me out with any big car issues, is there any need for a big emergency fund right now?

* Is it unwise of me to be focusing nearly 100% of my finances into paying these loans off right now? Should I start putting some money away for my eventual move-out now, or can that wait until after my loans are paid off?

* Any other advice for me right now?

Living with significant other in rental.  She can assist in condo purchase.  She has hourly stable job that pays approx 50k/yr

My job has 53k base salary but potential of 10-12k in yearly bonus (monthly sales goals)

Purpose of condo purchase is to live there for 5-10 years and once we start a family, buy a house but keep the condo as rental property

Would like to put approx 12-15% down payment on condo

Debt is approx $5400 in college debt at about 5%, trying to keep this as rolling debt to help credit score.  I am incorporating this debt as part of my condo purchase, my thought is that once I get a condo/mortgage I pay this off in favor of additional $5400 on mortgage at much lower interest rate than college loan.

Have a car lease (going into 2nd year of 3).  Unsure if I will buy out or not... Gf cannot drive stick so I may trade in and get auto at end (we were not dating when I got it)

I have a 401(k) with my employer, just raised to 7% contribution (they match to 6%).  I plan on increasing to at least 8% next year, possibly 9% or 10% of commission/bonus hits are strong in 2016.

Before I went, I made the decision that I wasn't signing anything today. I wanted to have time to get other pricing and to think about it. As soon as I told the salesman I wasn't signing today he immediately got the sales manager who tried very hard to persuade me to sign today.

It took 15 minutes to get him to accept that I wasn't going to sign today, even after him desperately trying to get me to name what I wanted. I told him i needed to think it over and i'd call him again later that week. He insisted that he could get me whatever I wanted, I just needed to tell him. 

I have a ~630 credit score, a few loans on it and no auto loan history. He told me that it's a hard situation to give me a loan but he could do it. My question is, what apr should I be expecting them to come back with, and what can I feasibly get approved for? I think I can get him closer to $150/month but the APR is where i'm lost.

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Strategy Questions,"Hi PF, 

I have questions concerning repaying my student loans. I am in my third year of college but will be graduating in May with a BS in Strategic Communications and Public Relations. 

I have two student loans:

$5500 federal unsubsidized @ 3.5%

$6500 federal unsubsidized @ 4.3% 

They've accrued almost 1k in interest over the last 2 years so I owe about 13k total right now. 

I currently work part time (20 hrs/week) making 25k a year (around 925 per pay period after taxes) and my only expenses are  food/gas, cell phone, and utilities. They come out to 400/mo. I pay rent with scholarship money so it isn't due until June 2016.

I have 7.5k in savings. 

My question is, should I start paying these off now instead of putting the money in savings even if I don't have to until November 2016? If yes, should I knock out one of the loans with big payments for a couple of months or just pay the 1k a month I put in savings. I'd like to be debt free as fast a possible. Thanks! 


Ps: Was going to buy new car a few weeks ago because I had the money to make monthly payments, PF talked me out of it- I now see that it would not have been a good financial decision. Thanks for that.",finance,1445806830

We were shown a car and drove it and loved it. We went to talk more about it and when we agreed they put it in for detailing. The paperwork said ""new"" with ""22 miles"" on odometer. Once home, I realized it had 2200. There were so many bells and whistles distracting me I didn't even know where to look.

So my question is, is there anything I can do since the contract has different numbers than what is in the vehicle? Am I stuck? How would you even get 2200 miles on a new vehicle?

UPDATE: Thank you all for your insight. I took it in this morning and while the first manager tried to push back that we had every opportunity to check the odometer, I stood on the fact that we never received a federally required odometer disclosure form, and while they wouldn't give us the jeep back they gave us a brand new 2016 with 6 miles (I verified...) with even better features AND tax/title covered for the same price.

DEBT

I have been paying down credit card debt and next month it will be completely paid off.  My remaining debt after that is $54k in student loans.

-----
SAVINGS
I have $10k in the bank and I'm maxing out my retirement options through my employer. 

-----
EXPENSES

This isn't a budget I ""created"" but rather me looking at my statements for the past 3 months and the top end of what I've spent during any of them when it comes to varying things like groceries, restaurants.

* Rent - $650
* Insurance - $90
* Utilities (gas/water/electric/sewer/garbage) - $90 (on balance budgeting so this hopefully won't vary a ton)
* Internet - $40
* Cell phone - $75
* Groceries - $250
* Restaurants and bars - $110
* Miscellaneous (clothing, entertainment, gifts) - $240

That totals $1545.

Right now I've been keeping a straight $10k in the bank as my emergency fund and putting all my excess toward my student loans, which is allowing me to be pretty aggressive.  I've been cutting that down by at least $2500 a month since I graduated.

I have never owned a car, always just used public transportation, but now for various reasons I need to purchase a vehicle. It will need to be reliable for getting me to work day-to-day as well as 200-mile trips around twice a month.

To be honest I'm not even sure where to start. Should I be buying a beater in cash or can I buy a nice certified pre-owned vehicle off a lot?  I am not particularly interested in cars in general but I would like one that I can keep long-term and rely on.  I grew up with my parents buying a $5k car every two years so if I can buy a $20k car and keep it for 10 that sounds good to me.

For reference, the rep I usually work with at my credit union said that based on a quick review of the numbers I could probably get an auto loan through them for at least 30-35k.  However I have not actually applied so I don't know what the interest rate would be.  (I also know I don't want to spend THAT much on a car, but that lets me know that if I can afford something more than a beater I could get financing).

I would appreciate some advice on how much I can afford to spend total on vehicle costs (including the vehicle itself, gas, maintenance, insurance).  Based on the total I can afford to put toward it I will try to find something that will fit in that price range what with insurance and all.

Sorry for bouncing around so much. Any advice appreciated.",finance,1445816444

I currently work in retail banking making 38k pre-tax but I get about $700 quarterly for a 6% 401(k) match and a quarterly sales incentive bonus that ranges between $400 and $2000 pre-tax. In addition, I work weekend nights at a hotel that brings in $300 every two weeks net. Together, my pre-tax comes to about $50K. I am about completing a Masters in Supply Chain and I got a low-ball offer from a large distribution company. 42k pre-tax, sign-on and relocation bonus for 15k and an RSU for 25k (current stock price) that fully vests in 4 years. Even though their 401(k) match is a tiny 2%, when compared to the 6% I currently have, the job area is one that I will like and will want to grow in. If I accept this offer, I'd have to either commute 78 miles to work one way. That comes to about $400 a month and I don't think I can keep my hotel part-time job. Relocating is an issue because we signed a new one year lease 2 months ago and my apartment complex is asking for 2 months rent (2400) and a 60 day notice to break the lease. My current company (retail bank) is willing to give me a counter offer. (higher retail bank position and annual of 55k in addition to incentives).

personalfinance,"(UK) Moving abroad from the U.K. to work in the Netherlands, confused over National Insurance and Student Loan","So I'm moving abroad to start a new job next week and I think I've sorted most things out but I'm still a bit confused over a few things, I just thought I'd dump my thoughts here, my main concerns are my Student Loans and National insurance contributions:

Student Loans - Since graduation 4 years ago I have paid my student loan contributions via PAYE up until January 2015 when I was made redundant from my last job. I haven't made any payments since and from reading the conditions I am unclear if I am obligated to make payments while abroad or just recommended to. Due to the low interest rate on the student loans, If I am not obligated to make payments would I be better off investing the payments separately within a Dutch bank account and then upon moving back to the U.K. in maybe 3-4 years time, use this money to pay off a lump sum of my loan in one go?

&amp;nbsp;


National Insurance - Again, I've made contributions to national insurance throughout my working life up until January 2015. Very similar question here, do I back pay my national insurance to ensure my contributions are uninterrupted or invest the same amount of money separately. I have 3 years contributions and am 26 years old. If I continue uninterrupted I will have paid the 35 years to claim state pension by the time I'm 58, which I can't claim until 68? So I'm worried about overpaying National Insurance I could potentially invest/save elsewhere while I am out of the country for the next 3-4 years. 

&amp;nbsp;


Pension-wise, my new role does not offer a matched pension as is required in the U.K. I have brought my previous two pension pots together and plan to continue paying a similar amount in myself as I have been over the last few years. 

&amp;nbsp;


However, my other option would be take the amount out of my salary each month that would usually cover Pension+Student loan+National Insurance Contributions and invest that amount in some way in Euros in the Netherlands, then on return to the U.K. distribute this back in to pension pot + Student loan payments.

Now I'm prepared to pay for my errors, I have ~1800 in savings as of now and am trying to save up 3000 to put towards a downpayment on a car. Carmax says at my income level now the only bank that's offering me a loan is saying i need 3000 down at an 18% interest rate, obviously I'm not going to do that.
But I do want to finance a car because I'd like to drive for Uber as a supplemental income. 
My parents (I'm 26) said that they would cosign on a car if I saved up more money because they see that I'm trying to turn over a new leaf and have been sticking true to that.
Now I just answered one of those collections calls and told them that I could put 20 dollars a month towards that and they're saying that they won't ""hold the file"" for that long. The guy was trying to talk me into 3 payments of ~200 dollars over the next three months or a lump sum payment of 500 to clear the whole thing out now.
I'm tempted to pay it off in full but that would set me back considerably towards the car.

I make ~600 a week serving tables and don't pay any rent. My only bill is my cellphone at 65 a month. I eat as much as I can at my restaurant to save money and generally I spend less than 20 dollars a week on food. If anyone can tell me that Uber is a bad idea, or that this collections guy is fucking with me and I can get 20 dollars a month, I would greatly appreciate any advice.

For example, the SPG5485A-CM-CR07A is a servomotor that Servocity took and adds another gear. If you look at the ratios, they are all (Base Torque * gear ratio), when they should be (Base Torque * Gear Ratio * Efficiency).

Each servo seems to have 5 stages. Assuming 95% efficiency per stage, .95^5=77%. When testing, I have found almost all of them stalling out at a torque around 75% of the rated value (+- 5%) when using the specified Vin. 

Also, I can't go into details on the exact setup, but I know that hobbyists just can't afford the test setup.

Test Setup: 

* Magtrol TM 307/011 torque transducer, Magtrol 34011 torque display, fed into an oscilloscope and custom matlab scripts.)
* bench supply and arbitrary function generator for the servo signal
* Also tested by bypassing the servo electronics and connecting directly to the motor
* All servos were modified for continuous rotation to facilitate testing.

For at least a week I had heard nothing but talk about Halo 3. So on the day it was to be released my husband went to work and planned to pick up the game after work. He is a landscaper. He had just started a new job and was trying to do as much as he could to prove himself. 

So at about 10 AM I received a call at work. It's my husband and the first thing he says is ""Don't worry I'm OK. I'm at the hospital, but I'm OK. I cut my finger pretty badly but they got me stitched up and it's all OK.""

So without even thinking the first thing I say is ""Now how are you going to play that damned game?!?""

It turns out he cut his left index finger almost to the bone while up in a tree trying to trim something. He was in a rush to finish on time and wasn't as careful as he could have been.  The hospital stitched him up really well, drugged him up and sent him home. When I got home from work he was all doped up and it was adorable. His finger had an enormous bandage on it. 

He begs me to go and pick up his game. I pointed out that it would be hard to play with the bandage and the drugs, but he insisted. How could I refuse him? So I drive across town to his preferred game store, go inside and pick up the massive box that is emblazoned with the picture of the helmet. 

I leave the store and as I'm walking towards my car, I see a man and his girlfriend. The girlfriend obviously does not want to be there. She looks completely fed up with her boyfriend's need to get Halo 3. The guy sees me and plaintively points at my box and says, ""But she got to get the helmet!"" The girlfriend just made a disgusted sound and said come on.

Lastly I have a car payment which is $505 / month.  I have a 6 year loan at 2.29% which comes to term in August of 2019.

The only other revolving credit we have is at 0%, which includes $105/month for our bed set, $40/month for living room furniture, and $50/month for appliances.  We use our credit cards exclusively for any purchases for the points, but they are paid off every month.  Average is $2,500 / month in living expenses which include food, entertainment, clothing, gas, etc. (we have 2 kids as well).  Trust me when I tell you we do not live extravagantly or above our means by any stretch of the imagination.  We live somewhat comfortably, but we are stretched very thin.

Between all the monthly debt listed above we are at a break even or a loss every month.  I am trying to pay off my debt as quickly as possible and am putting an extra $250/month on top of my loans.  

We currently net ~$6,200 / month on salary alone (I make $3400, she makes $2800).   I get to work overtime throughout the year which nets me another ~$1,350 / month although most of it is made in the summer.  Every January I get a raise which will give me another ~$400 / month for the next 7 years.  My wife gets very small raises year over year but the cost of her healthcare is rising so it's almost a wash.  

Attached is a spreadsheet I made and put on Google Docs.  The first sheet is our current monthly situation, the second is a rate/term refinance, and the third is cash out getting rid of the car and 2 student loans.

Basically I am looking at a better quality of life and being able to save.  I think if I were to go with the cash out, once all student loans are paid off and I am left with just the mortgage I will take the additional money and put it into my kids college fund and invest it into a retirement fund for my wife and I as opposed to paying off the mortgage entirely.  I've always been against using equity to pay off debt, but in this case there is a pretty big monthly savings, which is good if I have a month where something happens (new tires for the car, house repairs, etc.).  I am VERY disciplined when it comes to paying the bills and I will not waver from paying off our debt.

I have run all the numbers through unbury.us and the difference between the snowball and avalanche is 1 month in my current situation.  To me, I'd rather snowball it to see the progress and also eliminate my student loans asap.  My student loans are mostly in the 3.25-4.875 range, so it's paying off one before the other.  Either way the mortgage would be paid off last because in a snowball situation the mortgage has the highest debt, and avalanche it would have the lowest interest rate.

Thanks for reading my extremely long post.  I really look forward to hear what you guys have to say.

personalfinance,Should I withdrawal from an old retirement account to pay credit card debt?,"My first job after college was as a civilian employee for the Federal Government. I left government service after a couple of years with a balance of about $8,300 in my TSP G-Fund. Since then, I’ve found new employment and am in an overall better financial situation. Over the past year I have been working hard to pay off debt and start an emergency fund. As part of this plan, I’ve considered withdrawing my TSP balance and paying off my credit card and personal loan in full. Is this a good idea?  What are the penalties for withdrawing? 

Here are the details:

* Old TSP account: $8,300 (G-fund, 2.18% ROR - 5 year average)
* Current 401k: $7,200 balance. I currently contribute 6% - plus 4% company match.
* Credit Card: $865 balance at 17.99%	
* Personal Loan: $4,900 remaining at 6.99% (25 months remaining on loan)
* Emergency Fund: $450 balance

For the past 3 months, I have been paying the minimum on the credit card plus $300/month extra. For the personal loan, I pay about $200/month. I also have budgeted $200/month toward the emergency fund.  

If I withdraw from my TSP, there should be enough to pay off the credit card and personal loan in full with a small amount remaining that can be put toward my emergency fund. This frees up over $500 a month that I can use toward my emergency fund and student loans ($45,000 at 6.55%).

personalfinance,"22, graduated w/ big debt and living at home. Work is good but unstable. Need help deciding on immediate &amp; long-term priorities.","###Hi r/personalfinance,

Writing this from a brand-new account. I’m a 22-year-old male having just graduated from NYU with a BFA in music and some healthy student debt. While I’m aware that this was a bold, costly, and potentially foolish move, I went to school for what I love and I’m still pursuing it passionately. I'm not eager to regret that decision. Plus I graduated early, potentially saving myself and my family ~$30,000.

Getting a grip on my finances since leaving NYC in the spring has been made a lot easier: I’ve moved back to my home with my parents, reducing my living costs significantly. My earning potential at home is also much higher than NYC - aside from music, I work full-time as a server. I’m in a beach resort town, and while tips are off the charts in the summer, they become elusive this time of year, putting me in a shaky position. So, I'm here to solicit some different perspectives on what I should do with my money/planning.

####My strategy:

I'm inclined to be aggressively conservative - if that makes sense. Since I'm not offered any benefits at my serving jobs, I opened a Roth IRA with Vanguard this year and have been placing a good amount of money into that (after all my loans are taken care of and then some). Haven't reached the yearly max yet, as doing so would require a significant amount of money I should probably place elsewhere.

Any extra money I've had left over at the end of a given month goes straight to student debts, IRA, and emergency savings at roughly a 50/30/20 split.

Allowing myself room to have some fun, travel, and experience my 20's has been really important to me. I've cut back on a lot of expenses (no more coffee addiction, only buy groceries on sale if possible, free laundry at home etc.) and could probably make a wiser decision here and there, but I'm not egregiously overspending (I don't think).

Here's the nuts and bolts:

##Income

I have 3-4 sources of income during a given month. For October:

* **Serving jobs:** ~$2,500
* **Online music sales**: ~$800
* **DJing**: $500

In November, an apparel screenprinting business I began with my brother and a friend will commence sales, and that will add some more to my income. But I have honestly no idea what that figure will look like, so I'm not factoring that in at all. Shot in the dark: a few hundred bucks' profit. It's mostly a fun side-hustle we're engaging in when the town gets quiet and lonely.

For the music income, I historically prefer to reinvest that into my music business where possible - but I don't currently have anything I need/want to purchase, so I'm considering that money available for personal use.

####October Income Total: ~$3,800

**Bottom line:** While not low by any means, income is unstable, and as the weather gets colder, the serving money dries up completely. Need to decide where to put my money now, in order to have a steady short/med/long term life.

##So... what do I do?

My big goal is to obliterate my Parent Plus loan (obeying the avalanche method). That fucker is costing me over $500/mo, and I can't write off the interest since it's in my father's name. It's pure evil. But, with another summer of working at the beach, plus my parents contributing when and where they can, it should be paid off by this time next year. Then, with far less in loan payments, I hope to move back up to, or near, NYC, to further my music career.

To enable that to happen, I need to make money sooner than later. But winter's tough - my restaurant closes January-February, so I'm planning on heading back to the NYC area to crash with cousins/friends just outside the city for those months. Music's my eventual full-time career, and NYC is host to the only real prospects for longevity, so I'll be exclusively freelance producing and playing shit-for-pay gigs. I won't be paying rent though (...my family &amp; friends are the best).

**Should I plan to dip into my emergency fund for living costs this winter?** It's enticing, as I have absolutely no idea how much money I'll be making - if any - over these few months. Plus, I want to max out my IRA before year's end, which will require over $2K of the money I have on hand. I've been told time and time again about the importance of starting retirement savings young. Is that foolish given my goals, and should my extra money all go to my debts?

But there's more: I'm aware of how important credit score is in renting an apartment in NYC, but I feel torn for not taking advantage of my cards' current 0% APY intro rates. I have no plans to purchase a vehicle or home, since NYC is likely the next place I'll live. **Would it not be smarter to take a light credit score hit, put even MORE money towards my big daddy Parent Plus loan, and ease off paying the card balances until I'm making more money in the summer?**

Or am I being too comfortable with my voluntary expenses? For example, last month I bought a $640 round trip ticket to visit Romania with my brother and his new wife (who's from there). It's gonna be an unforgettable time, but it put me a bit in the hole... it wasn't exactly money I had just laying around. I paid it off on my CC at the expense of my retirement/loan contributions. That felt irresponsible. **Should priority #1 be to remove absolutely all suboptimal expenses, perhaps at the cost of some experiences/happiness?**

I work hard and I think I'm doing a good job here - my income's respectable on a yearly level, I'm not defaulting on my debts, and I'm doing what I love. But I want to be back in my favorite city as soon as possible (with as established of a career as possible), and have these few routes to explore. I'm sorry if any of these questions are redundant or common sense - I've read through all the r/personalfinance materials and still can't make up my mind. Also sorry for the novel.

personalfinance,AES/FedLoan rate reduction??,"My first time posting but I've been stalking this forum for some time.  I currently have 270k in debt at an interest rate of 6.55%.

Here's my big question:  has anyone actually reached the rate reduction offered after 36 on time payments with AES or Fedloan?

personalfinance,Which refinancing option to pick?,"I am currently trying to refinance my private loans that I foolishly got from HESAA when I was a bit younger and dumber. Probably a lot dumber.

&amp;nbsp;

But I would like people's thoughts and opinions on my options. So I am refinancing three private loans from HESAA. All three together would be:

&amp;nbsp;

Total Balance: ~$48,300

Total Monthly Payment: ~$480

Combined Interest Rate: 8.08%

Estimated Payoff Date: 14 years 2 months

&amp;nbsp;

And these are the refinancing options I am considering.

- Citizens Bank, 15 year variable rate @ 4.51%. Not capped.  Estimated payment for now is $375.


- CordiaGrad, 12 year fixed rate @ 5.90%. Monthly payment is $469.


- SoFi, 15 year variable rate @ 5.20% capped at 9.95%. (5.00% + 1 month LIBOR). Estimated payment for now is $392.

&amp;nbsp;

Tried CommonBond but denied. They wanted a consigner which 1.) I didn't want to have to put anyone in that position (another reason I am refinancing, to remove my cosigners from those loans) and 2.) I wouldn't know a cosigner meeting their $80k salary requirement. Earnest denied me for low savings which sucks since the root cause of my low savings are my student loans.

&amp;nbsp;

I would like to chose the variable rate for now just because I am struggling to build up some savings since a lot of it goes towards student loans. And I do have 4 other federal loans @ 6.56%, each for ~$2k, that I would also like to focus on, others are at 3.15-5.35% which aren't as much of a priority. My parental unit also took out a PLUS for me (7.650%) which I pay for also but didn't refinance since I've been paying that since I started school so the time to payoff is much shorter than the others, estimated 4 years 4 months which hopefully I could payoff faster with any savings from refinancing. 

&amp;nbsp;

If rates increased at a gradual rate, is it possible to just refinance again when variable rates become greater than the fixed rates I've gotten? Is there an acceptable/unacceptable amount of times to refinance or the amount of time between refinancing? Is it okay to refinance again in a year or two when my financials look better for further rate reductions (Expecting a 10% pay increase in that time.)? or is there an optimal time to refinance?

My first student loan has just come in the mail, I have two loans taken out all together. The first loan is for $11,000 with interest I will end up paying $13,914; my second loan is for $26,000 and I'm not sure what the exact interest rate on that is... I have not received the bill, once I do I will update you guys. My issue is not affording these loans, my issue is figuring out how I should go about on a job-aspect...
I current have three options, one of which I am very biased on as it has been a dream job of mine.
1) Landscaping - $10/hour, roughly 15-20 hours a week.
2) IT Work - $22.50/hour, roughly 15 hours a week (1099 tax though)
3) Electronic repair - $15/hour, no hours a week yet, this is just a job offer I have and do not know whether to take advantage of it or not.

I took 2 years of Computer Science, then I fell into a strut (mentally, depression), grades began to fall, I dropped out, so I have no degree under me, I am starting my own 'business' in my area, doing IT Work for small businesses and that's the biased job... however the hours aren't there, and neither are the clients. I want to do this for a living, but have no prior experience and no degree, I just really know computers, so I really couldn't even find a job with a larger company so I wanted to start my own thing and attempt to start a name for myself.

The first bill is $115/month for 10 years, and I'm worried that the other loan will be at least double that and though I can afford them, I'm just not sure what to do because I will then have no extra money to save for an apartment.

I'm sorry this post is sort of everywhere, my mind is flustered and I'm kind of everywhere myself at the moment of this posting.. please bear with me and I will revise it in time.",finance,1445894439

personalfinance,Student loan interest rate,"I have been repaying my student loan, that was formerly outstanding, for 12 months now.  My interest rate is so high, that my balance has not gone down at all, despite paying more than the minimum payment.  What can I do?",finance,1445895056
personalfinance,Need advice about my situation,"I'm a 24 year old male and my only financial experience is with cash and debit cards. I'm currently facing a situation I've never encountered before and would like some input about my current plan to address it.

I will graduate with a bachelor of science in Environmental Technology from a state university on the east coast in December, at which point my plan is to move across the US to the west coast to join my girlfriend who is attending graduate school there. I will have no student debt. I have supported myself through a combination of significant parental aid, financial aid, and part-time jobs. I am currently essentially broke. I had been supporting myself up to this point from the money I had saved from a full-time summer internship, but that has since run out and I have borrowed money from my mother to pay next month's rent. I have been applying for fall internships and part-time jobs since my summer internship ended, but nothing panned out.

I feel like I have a lot on my plate right now between finishing up my final semester, figuring out how to afford my living expenses for the next two months (and transportation across the country), and finding a full-time job in the state to which I am moving. I believe my degree will make me very hireable, but I need to start looking for jobs now in order to try to ensure I will be employed soon after moving.

My current plan, which I would like some feedback on, involves finding some odd jobs to do for spending money, and getting my first credit card for larger expenses. It feels pointless to me to go through the job-hunting process and try to obtain a part-time job with only two months until I plan to move. In the past it has taken me a full month between applying for a job and actually starting it, and this was complete with several personal visits to a manager to express my interest and see if I could do anything to help move the hiring process along. I plan to scour craigslist and sites like sweeps.jobs (anyone have any personal experience with this one?) to find local work like walking dogs, mowing lawns, moving furniture, etc. I'll also look for seasonal positions around the holidays, but they'll have to fit with my class schedule.

Additionally, my sister encouraged me to get a credit card. I know I'm overdue for building credit, but I've never had the interest or really even thought about it seriously until now. I used the search bar and found some very useful posts for introducing me to the basic concepts. I tagged this post with the ""credit"" flair because this is probably the area in which I need the most advice. My plan as far as the credit card goes is to use it to purchase my plane ticket, since I need to do that ASAP or prices will continue to rise as the date gets closer. I will also probably use it to pay my rent for December. I don't believe I will make enough from of the odd jobs I find to purchase these things, and while I understand that it's important to pay the statement balance each month, which I will not be able to do, I'm hoping that I can find a card with a 0% interest rate for the first 6 or so months, such that I can pay the minimum balance without accumulating interest. I know that will cause my credit score to lower slightly, but that's not my main concern right now, as I believe my degree will make me very hireable and once I have a full-time job I'll be able to pay off the balance I have generated pretty quickly and then work on building credit from there. I understand I'm taking a gamble, but I'm very confident that I can find employment within 6 months. So, if my understanding is correct, the attributes I need to be most concerned about when looking for a credit card should be that it has no interest for the first few months, and I need a credit limit of at least $1500 to cover a month of rent ($425), a plane ticket, and possible unforeseen expenses like car troubles or medical bills.

Am I missing anything? Are there any flaws in my plan, or potentially better plans? I'm loathe to continue borrowing money from my mother because she's recently moved and she has plenty of expenses of her own right now. Thanks in advance for reading and for any advice offered.",finance,1445897289
personalfinance,"House gained huge value, too many options and I don't know what is the most financially responsible.","I know there is a huge argument on whether to buy or rent here. This is not about that. I need help with my current situation and what would help me. First let me give you background. 

**Background:**

I bought my home in April of 2013 for 264,000 in northern California. It needed some work, especially landscaping. I made it a lot nicer and did some remodeling. I probably put around 25k into it total. Now my home appraises for 550-600k (3 appraisals with comps). Part of the reason I got an incredible deal was because the sq footage was incorrectly listed at 1600 and is really 2600. Also year built was 1960s and the home was brand new. It burnt down and was rebuilt and sold by and oversees bank before MLS updated.

I currently make 78k gross and around 85k gross with overtime. My wife's income is unstable, she probably makes around 30-40k a year. 

My mortgage is around 1486 a month at 4.4% interest and I owe 240k with no pmi. Our only debt is 40k(600/month) in student loans and 10k cc. No car debt, $400 lease till April.

I don't know whether to sell or refinance or do nothing. Here are the options I have considered. 

**If I sell:**

IF I sell at 550k I will be left with around 280k after taxes and title fees. I could do two things. 

1. Pay off my debts and put 240k into a new home. I could get a nice brand new home on the other side of town for 350-420k.with higher property taxes and hoa I'll have about the same monthly payment but with no debt. 

2. Sell and rent. Pay off my debt than invest the 240k. With connections I could invest in commercial real-estate and get a nice return plus the monthly rent check or do your standard Vanguard investing. I have no interests in stocks. Commercial real-estate usually sees a 20% return in 4 years with the company I can invest with plus your monthly rent check. The problem with it is your cash gets tied up and a pay day comes when a project sells, usually 4-6 years. The other issue with this is that renting a home in my area will cost 2k/month for what I need and what I could buy. I can't figure out if investing will be worth it with such high rent. 

**Refinancing:**

I'm only 25 so refinancing to 30 years with an additional 80k on top isn't terrible. 50k for debt and the rest to supplement my roth Ira and have an emergency fund started would be helpful. My property taxes are based off the 260k price which is attractive to me. My monthly payment should stay around the same but I won't have student loans or debt anymore. 

I could also just refinance for the minimum to pay off student loans and debt. 

Either way my interest rate should lower a bit. 

**Conclusion:**

I see all options as equally attractive and hope that r/personalfinance can offer some perspective and maybe an option I didn't consider. Thank you in advance for your time.",finance,1445897876
personalfinance,"Tax Warrant, Tax Penalties, holy shit, I am so fucked. Please help.","Hi.

So for a while I was living in New York and commuting to work in New Jersey. I was going to a family friend's tax company in order to get my taxes done. I went there for about 5 or 6 years. Maybe from 2009 to 2014. So I get a letter in the mail about 6 months ago telling me that because I didn't file in New York for 2009 and 2010 I owe, and on top of the actual taxes I ow about 8000 in penalties. I went back and looked at my returns and it looks like the tax company didn't file in New York for every year that I was living in New York and commuting to New Jersey. They ONLY filed for New Jersey and for the federal taxes.

Now I'm in collections. They're asking me to refile for the years of 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. So far I've only gotten fees for 2009 and 10. I assume the rest are forthcoming. I've set up a payment plan for now, I'm REALLY broke. I only make about 1200 a month because I'm in school full time and working part time. I can't really afford to pay more than $100 a month but that doesn't sound like it's good enough for them.
Can anyone advise me on what to do in this situation? It's really making me crazy. I'm worried that they're just going to clean out or freeze my bank account or repossess everything I own (which is almost nothing) or something.'

I made sure to ask that I would have the disc in my hand  before launch day.  I was told yes.  I asked again later on in the convo with the CSR before it was finalized that I would have it in time to play it on the midnight launch, she confirmed.  Said it would take 3-5 days (not business days, she said just days, regular ole days) and I would get an e-mail in 24hrs when the order is confirmed.

Never got the email. So Thursday I hop back on Xbox Support and ask whats going on.  They tell me not to worry, that they're having problems with the emails but she can see that my order was processed and it's being mailed.  I too ensure from her that the disc will be in my hand and in my Xbone for me to play it on the midnight release.  She says yes, 3-5 days so it'll be here soon. Again, not in business days.  

It's the 5th *day*.

I have no disc. I also have no code now since they deactivated mine to mail me the disc.

Contact Support to see what they're going to do about this issue.
Nothing.  Not a damn thing.  The chat rep says I just have to wait.  They can't reactivate my code, they cant generate a new one for the game but she can generate me a code for the add ons but I have to wait for the disc to use it.  Well what the hell good is that.  She give me a FedEx tracking # that says it was picked up from the initial departing TODAY AT 3:02PM in Memphis, TN. 
 
So it wont take 3-5 days to ship.  It will take 3-5 days to process the order. She tells me that the order was processed and completed on 10/21 but today was the available time that FedEx was able to pick up the shipment.  Really?  It took FedEx a week to come get a confirmed shipment.  From Microsoft. 
 
No.  I'm pretty sure what happened was ya'll dropped the ball on this one.

I asked to have a manager contact me and that's whom I just got off the phone with.  The Support ""Manager"" was no help what-so-ever.  All I got was a ""sorry for the inconvenience"".  They told me I just had to wait for the disc.  I asked what they were going to do about this drastic inconvenience and she said sorry. I said no kick backs?  No extra req packs?  You can't generate me a code for more add ons all of a sudden? Free chat pad, controller skin, phone call from Master Chief, key chain, anything?

Nothing...

Just an I'm sorry and please wait for the disc.

Now I'm off to GameStop to pick up my collectors edition guide that they couldn't sell me early for a game that I can't play on launch day anyway.  FML

SoFi called me back and lowered their rate and agreed to pay Citizens but it would be at a rate of 4.025VAR/8.9% cap.

personalfinance,Have I screwed myself with this 457(b) life insurance policy?,"Hello all.

In March I started a 457(b) plan in the form of a term life insurance policy with a surrender value. I've been able to make pre-tax payments because I work in a school system, but since I plan on leaving next year I decided to look at it again since it may no longer be so advantageous for me. No more pre-tax payments for example.

Huge problem, I perceived this as more of a savings account with a life insurance policy. It's apparently the other way around. If I can't make payments, even in a case of financial distress, I get the surrender value, which is shit until 15 years pass and $0 for the next three years.

Now I'm single with no dependents and no prospect on the rise either, so I have no real need of a life insurance policy. The agent keeps trying to sell me on how I've locked in this low rate, but it's for something I don't need.

The interest rate on the eventual surrender value is apparently guaranteed at 3% and is presently 4%.

Advice? I'm inclined to just cancel it right now and avoid continuing to throw money away. $1000 so far is a pricey mistake but I've had more expensive life lessons. I just can't see this as an investment vehicle when a single fuck-up will make it all disappear. I'm entering grad school soon and that makes the continued maintenance of this plan a piece of baggage I'd rather not deal with.

My wife is expecting our second child, due in June 2016, and is going to stay home from work beginning in September 2016 (she is a teacher and will receive income until the end of August).  Our income will reduce from $125,000/yr combined to roughly $85,000/yr.  Monthly take-home pay after taxes, healthcare, and contributions will be $4,735.  Here is a breakdown of monthly obligations:

- $1,475 mortgage
- $268 car payment (I pay $300/mo, owe just over $14,000, 2015 Subaru Legacy)
- $379 car payment (Owe roughly $18,500, 2011 Subaru Outback)
- $400 student loans (min. payment is $125, owe $28,000, 4.5% - 6.75% interest rate)
- $149 internet/TV
- ~$500 utilities / misc.
- $400 groceries / entertainment
- $400 tithings / charity budget

= Roughly $4,000 in monthly obligations with little wiggle room.

We will get rid of our hefty daycare bill of $1,115/mo with her staying home, may do a mother's day out for around $150/mo.

Sitting on $24,000 nest egg in savings, only yielding .75%.  I auto-contribute $35/week to slowly grow it and prep for college for the kids.  I also get contingent, performance-based quarterly bonuses which go directly into savings, average $2,000.

Just curious if anyone has experienced the same situation.  I would love to pay off some debt.  I know the rule of thumb is to pay off the higher interest debt first.  Honestly, my instinct is to get rid of one car payment...  

I am looking to lower our monthly obligations first, and chip away at more debt when she returns to work in 5-7 years.

Other metals and minerals are formed by the various natural systems the Earth goes through, such as the movement of the tectonic plates.  Or the forming of diamonds from coal being exposed to intense heat and pressure.

During this time, since no beings were really harvesting the various resources, the Earth began to form a stockpile of all of these things, including the various forms of life.  Over millions of years it formed these stockpiles, such as fossil fuels (oil / gas).

""Contrary to what many people believe, fossil fuels are not the remains of dead dinosaurs. In fact, most of the fossil fuels we find today were formed millions of years before the first dinosaurs.

Fossil fuels, however, were once alive!

They were formed from prehistoric plants and animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago.

Think about what the Earth must have looked like 300 million years or so ago. The land masses we live on today were just forming. There were swamps and bogs everywhere. The climate was warmer. Ancient trees and plants grew everywhere. Strange looking animals walked on the land, and just as weird looking fish swam in the rivers and seas. Tiny one-celled organisms called protoplankton floated in the ocean.

When these ancient living things died, they decomposed and became buried under layers and layers of mud, rock, and sand. Eventually, hundreds and sometimes thousands of feet of earth covered them. In some areas, the decomposing materials were covered by ancient seas, then the seas dried up and receded.

During the millions of years that passed, the dead plants and animals slowly decomposed into organic materials and formed fossil fuels. Different types of fossil fuels were formed depending on what combination of animal and plant debris was present, how long the material was buried, and what conditions of temperature and pressure existed when they were decomposing.

For example, oil and natural gas were created from organisms that lived in the water and were buried under ocean or river sediments. Long after the great prehistoric seas and rivers vanished, heat, pressure and bacteria combined to compress and ""cook"" the organic material under layers of silt. In most areas, a thick liquid called oil formed first, but in deeper, hot regions underground, the cooking process continued until natural gas was formed. Over time, some of this oil and natural gas began working its way upward through the earth's crust until they ran into rock formations called ""caprocks"" that are dense enough to prevent them from seeping to the surface. It is from under these caprocks that most oil and natural gas is produced today.""

We can view this natural supply as a savings account, that our mother (Mother Nature) had set up for us before we were ever born. And over the years, it grew and grew. Then humans came into the picture and we eventually started to harvest the different resources. We hunted the different animals for food and clothing, along with other various body parts for materials to build tools. We gathered plants for food and material for various tools and structures. At first, like most other species, our numbers and cumulative harvesting habits were in a small enough amount that the natural functions of the planet could keep pace.

It would be akin to us making withdrawals from the ""savings account""; as long as they were small enough amounts spaced out, the interest rate would keep up so we did not start having a negative growth rate and possibly even keep a positive growth rate if they were small enough. So it seemed we could never run out. But then we learned different techniques to increase our harvesting rate, and our numbers grew so even more people were harvesting at ever faster and faster rates. Then came the Industrial Revolution which exponentially increased our speed of harvesting, all the meanwhile our species grew in number. And now we are in the automation age, along with being funneled into a Consumerist and Disposable Goods lifestyle / behavior patterns.

""For most of human history man has been a hunter and gatherer; although his use of fire, and local over-population, may have altered the environment, the consequences of his actions were small compared with those of farmers. Plants and animals were first domesticated some 12-10000 years ago, and sedentary agriculture slowly became established in most parts of the world."" David Grigg; The Industrial Revolution and Land Transformation; Chap 4, Intro

http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_32/SCOPE_32_1.4_Chapter4_79-109.pdf

Quite a while ago, we started dipping into that savings account of resources Mother Nature had set up, to the point in which we are outpacing the ""interest rate"" so we effectively have a negative growth rate.

Another analogy I have used in the past incorporates that old idea of endless wells that so many used to see our supply of resources as. They have never been endless wells (with a few exceptions such as wind and hydroelectric power); they have always been more akin to wells that refill slowly over time. And we are taking from the well faster than it can replenish itself. And some of these wells can not replenish at all if they are totally emptied, such as an animal species. If we get the population so low, that species eventually goes extinct. And once it is extinct, we can not get it back.

But to consistently grow a metric known as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) we must continue this pattern. To keep the masses enthralled and distracted, we must continue this pattern. To keep a small elite group in power over the rest of humanity, we must continue this pattern.

We can see where this pattern leads to, so do we want to continue this pattern?

We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

Here in America, are we living up to the idea of securing the ""Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"" if we let ourselves run out of resources and don't leave any for future Americans? Do we even secure our own Liberty if we allow economic models that allow small private groups to take full control (privatize) of various resources?

From the same documentary, Professor Noam Chomsky states:

""“Human beings are complex creatures. I mean for example, we are capable right now, at this minute, of acting, in such a way as too, make it likely if not certain that our grandchildren are going to face terrible disasters. And we are consciously acting too accelerate that likelihood even though we all love our grandchildren. How can you be more contradictory then that?”

These are the problems faced when dealing with any Consumerist Based Economic Model, which includes Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, or any hybrid variation of said models.

""  ""sustainable development."" In the past, the mainstream theories and models of development hardly addressed the critical environmental and ecological issues. For instance, development theories within the conservative tradition, including various economic growth theories and modernization theories, are predominantly concerned with how to enchance economikc growth and accumulation, efficient production and allocation, political stability and order, and entrepreneurial culture and personality, but they are often indifferent towards the environmental costs of economioc production and accumulation. Similarly, the tradition of radical development theories, including classical Marxist and neo-Marxist theories (except Marzian environmentalists such as M.R. Redclift, James O'Connor, and Barry Commoner), tends to deal with variou modes of production, production relations, and class structures whikle overlooking the question of environmental disorders and ecological damages caused by capitalist production of environmental disorders and ecological damages caused by capitalist produciton and industrial expansion. Radical dependency theories explain the existing world capitalist system based on unequal exchange and center-periphery dependency as the main cause of underdevelopment, but they hardly deal with intergenerational dependency and underdevelopment cause by environmental challenges such as depletion of nonrenewable resources and decline of biodiversity. In short, the major theories and models of development articulated under the conservative-capitalist and radical-socialist perspectives, have a common drawback in their relative indifference toward the implications of environmental issues for human development.""

From the Capital Institute, a non-partisan American Think Tank:

""There are three major crises in the world that must be resolved fairly soon:

*Economic activities in the fossil fuel-based global market system have exceeded the limits of a safe operating space for humanity of three planetary boundaries: climate change, the nitrogen cycle, and biodiversity loss.

*The uneven distribution of economic output, wealth, inocme, and scarce planetary developed countries and those living in conditions of extremem poverty in underdeveloped and developing countries.

*An unstable global financial system continues to operate largely in the absence of the oversight and regulation that could prevent another meltdown in this system like that which occurred in December 2008.

The business-as-usual approach to dealing with these crises is predicated on the assumption that they can be resolved by identifying and eliminating the linear connections between ""root"" causes and their effects. What those who take approach have apparently failed to realize is that the systems associated with the crises are not seperate and distinct. They are embedded in and interactive with one another in a global market system in which causes are consequences and consequences are causes.""

Many people have spoken on this same subject, including myself on numerous occasions.  We have presented the same information in numerous ways to reach the people and try to get them to break through the illusion and lies of the past.

No form of market economy, or consumerist based economic model tinkering will fix the problem.  We need true fundamental change.  Our savings account is running dry, and all the litter we have created by using up that savings account is trashing our home, and we have no place to throw all that trash besides our own yard.

And all of this leads into the social ills we see today by applying different forms of stress onto the populace which lead them into actions of desperation to try to survive and blow off steam.

Let us make the change, not only for ourselves, but for our Posterity as well.

Day care is killing us, $800 per kid each month.  We have been working hard to bring down our expenses this year, but still have lots of room for improvement.  We have about $525,000 in investments.

personalfinance,I need some help with a strategy to pay down my debts.,"This is my first post on reddit, but I read the personal finance sub and have learned a lot from other redditors.  Now I am hoping to post my financial situation on here and maybe some out-of-the-box thinkers can give me some thoughts on the best route I should go to pay this debt off!  My goal is to be worth nothing by year's end 2016.
So let me get down to it:


Current debt is $23,692.69

Discover Card  $2400 balance at 0% APR until February 2016


FedLoan $21,292.69

   This is comprised of four loans-listed from highest interest rate:


     $6019.91  at 6.8%
     $5,669.18 at 5.6%
     $5,541.87 at 4.5%
     $4,061.73 at 3.4%


My E-fund is low  I currently have $7,853.92, but am tomorrow I am paying my AMEX in full ($1327.09), leaving me $6526.83.
I like to keep $5000 in the bank at all times, lower than that and I feel uncomfortable and stressed.


I have a couple of ideas of how I think it would be best to pay these down.  First, my Discover card- $2400- is only 0 APR until February 2016, but I want to leave myself a comfortable margin wherein I am taking advantage of the zero interest, but I am also not leaving myself in a position where the card is not paid off in time, so I intend to full pay off that card by Jan 2016.   (this is important to me-when I transferred my balance to this card it had over $6000 on it so I have paid a lot off in the past year.  I don't want to get another card and transfer this balance to that one over a couple measly grand and pay yet another balance transfer fee over such a small sum).



SO:  this means that
NOV- $800                     or          NOV-$1200
DEC- $800                                  DEC-$1200
JAN- $800


A little note on Christmas:
I am going to Mexico with the fam, I have paid for the tickets and we all decided no gifts.  I mean I plan on spending maaayyyybe $100 on a good friend of mine and that's it.  So for Christmas I have budgeted $700 spending for my trip and $100 for my good friend.  


Additionally, now would be a good time to mention that I am a server and pull in about-$650-$800/week cash.  Paychecks are negligible, sometimes $0.  My rent is $600/mo  Utilities are roughly $200.  I pay $80/mo gas.  Insurance is $80/mo  My car is paid off.  So expenditures are reasonable when compared with income.  Also, I am not a flippant spender, I have been so focused on paying off my debt that just buying myself a coffee launches me into an entire debate with myself so I'm being cheap til my debt is gone and I don't care who knows it!  So roughly 2 weeks of work takes care of my bills while 2 weeks is left for unforeseen expenses and debt.  Monthly I make $2600 to $3200.  Expenses are $1000/mo Hence, $1600-2200 is left over. And I figure on using $1200/ mo for bills, the rest is to save and spend on life and stuff.  Now for that high-interest rate student loan!  My required monthly payments are $172/mo for the loans and last month I paid that plus an additional $800 toward JUST the high interest rate loan ($6019.91).  
I can't do that the next couple months because I want to save for my trip and pay off Discover.  With $1200 left over after expenses I was thinking that the next few months of bill payments would look like this:



NOV- FedLoan $172   High loan $extra $200 (total $372)
        Discover $900  
Total $1272   


So I slightly overstretch here, but if you look back at my math I have overestimated my expenses and underestimated my income, leaving myself a margin of several hundred dollars which I intend to throw in savings toward my vacation and use just to get by.


DEC- FedLoan $172 + 100 to high loan (total $272)
        Discover $1000  
Total $1272


JAN- FedLoan $172 + 600 for high interest loan
       Discover $500   PAID OFF YAY!
Total $1272

Then, subsequent months I will just throw everything I've got leftover at my student debt.  

Okay, so that is my thought-process on how to spend my money for the next couple of months.  My specific questions to anyone who may be reading this are regarding whether there is just something I am not considering when it comes to this debt that may make it easier on me or save me money.  And once I have my Discover and High interest student loan paid should I then start shifting my focus to long-term investments or just spend all of my extra cash paying off my 5.6% debt then my 4.5% debt and so on.  

Sorry if this seems jumbled, but it is 4 am and I am thinking about money so I am writing while sleep-deprived.  Hopefully most of this made some sense.

Also I want to thank this subreddit for helping me become aware of my finances.  I have made so much headway paying off my debts this past year.  I paid off about $8,000 in debt and, more importantly, cut a ton of extra expenses out, which has helped me be able to free up even more money to put towards my debts.  This year I'm paying it off, my goal is to get into nursing school and be able to earn my ABSN without working!  Thanks Reddit :)",finance,1445944732

personalfinance,I'm 17 and a friend offered me credit advice for a Car?,"Step one: Save up 500.00 dollars and go to any bank and get a secure credit card with one of your parents.

Step two: After you get the card wait for a minimum of seven days before you use it; this gives the credit bureau's a chance to get you in the system to start a credit report on you. I would recommend that you use that time to review the requirements that you will be personally responsible for, like account maintenance also known as a service charge (etc...). Of course keep track of all information given to you. Make sure you ask any questions if don't understand when you set-up this account; pay attention to your interests rate and when your billing cycle began and ends. I repeat don't for get to ask questions if you do not understand. After the seven days has past get a cash advance it don't have to be the maximum amount of the card; get whatever you are comfortable with.Their may be a service charge, but they usually give individuals one free cash advance every billing cycle. 
.
Step Three: After you gotten the advance give it to me naw I'm just playing (LOL). Don't spend it use it pay off the bill before your billing cycle ends which is exactly thirty days after you make your first purchase or advance you do this so you would not incur interest for that cycle.

Step four: Every thirty one days repeat step three just change the amount every time. Repeat this step for three quarters or nine months. Your credit score should shoot up anywhere from a hundred to a three hundred points. Of course this depends on the dollar amount you charge or the advance amount you get and how often you do this. If you want and if you have the financial resources you can do this multiple times in a billing cycle but this all depends on how comfortable you are with this process. 

Step five: After you achieved the score you want for the vehicle you wish to buy go to a used car dealership and have them to run a credit check of course they would love to lock you in a long drawn out payment plan but you will not need that. After your credit score comes back they will offer you a loan don't take it; use the knowledge of your score to your advantage do your research on the going rate of that car and what others are paying with the same credit score you have. If the interest rate isn't lower then the bank then use your card to pay the car. Remember this is all about getting the lowest rate possible so you can pay off your car faster. Now there's still a lot of information that I left out but this will get you going in the right direction. After three quarters the bank will send you another card offer with a higher line of credit and a lower rate take it and only use the second card to buy your car.      

Step Six: Now after you have gotten the card please make sure you have at least 700.00 hundred saved up so you could a huge portion of the principle off which will lower your payments. The banks normally give you a grace period to pay off the balance. The period varies some are ninety day and some are 120 days but that all depends on your pay history with them. I'll explain more to you when I get more time but this will definitely put you down the right path.",finance,1445956527

The only way we could do it would be to either draw from retirement accounts or almost completely deplete our emergency fund, neither of which I am willing to do.

We don't own our car outright.  We have a house but we just bought it a few months ago so we would basically exhaust every ounce of equity we earned with our down payment.  So... neither of those are options.

I've looked into personal loans but I've only seen pretty high interest rates.  I refuse to finance anything higher than 5%.

We are going to put a 50% deposit in cash.  Is there any way to use the instrument as collateral for the remaining 50%?  Are there any banks or financial institutions that have loans for this purpose with low(er) interest rates?

We both have very high credit scores and enough income.  We could pay cash for the instrument if we had a longer period to save but for this... we don't.

I've been trying to think outside the box.  There are credit cards with 0% introductory APR so one idea I had was to find a credit card with 18 month 0% and throw everything on there.  We would be able to pay it off in 18 months.  The risk here is that if something were to happen and we couldn't pay it off as quickly we would be stuck with a crazy high interest rate.  This seems like a high risk/high reward option that maybe should be a last resort.

personalfinance,32(M) Looking to get an assessment of what I'm doing right and wrong (long post).,"I’m looking to get an honest take on my overall financials. Like many others who went to law school, I have incurred a high amount of student loan debt. However, I graduated in 2009, which was basically the worst time to ever graduate from law school. As such, due to a number of factors, including the economy, mild depression, I found myself frozen out of the attorney job market as vastly under-experienced, but not considered for entry-level jobs due to being out of law school for many years. I did what most attorneys did in my situation, contract work doing doc review, which I was able to parlay into a somewhat stable full time job as an e-discovery project manager. Pay, however, is not great.   
Here’s the numbers:  
Debt:   
$202,000 in federal debt Stafford/grad plus, currently on IBR ($161,000 in principle) @ aggregate 7.19%  
	Payment: $349/mo  
$14,300 private bar study loan @ 6%   
	Payment: $118.02/mo  

Income: $60,000/yr  
Expenditures:  
Rent: $850/mo  
Utilities (phone, cable, electricity, gas): $170/mo  
Groceries: $300/mo  
Student Loans: ~$470/mo  
Transport: $50/mo  
Health (Doctor, dentist, vitamins, etc): $40/mo  
Savings:   
$15,500 Cash  
~$10,500 (Roth) (half in VO, half in JCLGX)  
~$5000 (Traditional IRA) (in JCLGX)  
~$5000 (municipal bond fund )  
(note: looking to get out of the JCLGX funds and into Vanguard as soon as my yearly fee-less sell is available)  
Currently, I have my monthly budget set up in Mint to have a monthly income of $3400 (I’m discounting months with 3 pay periods, as pure bonus savings) and have budgeted to spend about $2500/mo overall. I never go over, and often stay under my monthly cap. Which means I save $900-1100 per month.   
My job offers a 401k, but no match, so I focus the first $5500 of savings in a year to maximize my traditional IRA to reduce my AGI, to keep my IBR payments as low as possible.   
  
I’ve mapped out remainder of my student loan payments under all the available plans to me (IBR Single, IBR married but filing separately, REPAYE single, REPAYE married) and the option, assuming marriage eventually, is IBR but filing separately that allows me to have paid the least overall, including the large tax penalty upon forgiveness. I’ve also tried calculating throwing that $800-1000 per month into early payments against principle, but that was much worse, as the loan was paid off right around the time of forgiveness, gaining me absolutely nothing.   
  
Right now I’m just looking for a general assessment, and confirmation of my next plans. I think, ideally, I should keep about $3000 in my checking, move $7000 over to a Barclays 1% high-yield savings as my emergency savings. Lastly, any future savings over my $10,000 and isn’t earmarked for the year’s IRA contribution, will be put towards paying off the private bar study loan. While I know it’s not the highest interest, realistically, forgiveness is my only option on the federal loans, and 6% is still higher than my investments are getting me yielding me right now.

personalfinance,"(BE) Petrolhead here, thinking about buying a different car, could use some advice on budget, need to move out house in 2 years","Hello reddit,
I've been a longtime lurker on many subs, but never saw the need to make a post myself, until now.
So the situation:
I'm a true petrolhead, I'm either thinking the entire day about cars or reading stuff about them whenever I have some free time.

I'll try and keep it short

Insurance has come down to slightly more sensible levels now (age 23) so I finally can start looking for a car I really like and is petrolhead worthy.

The car I'm thinking about:
Renault Megane RS 2010-2013
250/265hp
340nm
+/- 1350kg
colour not white or yellow

For around 16-19k euro


My current car is a nice vw golf 6 2.0tdi, yes the dieselgate one..
So this whole VW diesel problem comes at a bad time, the car used to be easy to sell, before the dieselgate thing it would easilly sell for 10k+ now I'm getting trade in offers of only 6.5-7k from 'we buy your car' sites.

I have owned this car for 2 years.
I'm assuming if I manage to find a nice example of the megane at a garage that I can get 8k trade in for mine, should look into this..

assuming the car costs 18K -8k trade in leaves 10K I have to pay.
The megane will cost quite a bit more to run on a yearly basis, but running cost shouldn't be a problem at all (if insurance is &lt;€2000)

Now I still live at home, have a GF (4years now), will move out of home in 2 years (age 25) and probably rent something for 1 year with gf and if it works we'll buy something together

I have +65k at the bank, this year I saved +/- 19k (without minimizing expenses, so potentially 1.5-3k more if needed) , I'm assuming the same maybe slightly less (because of higher running costs of car) for the next 2 years say 18k/year should be my minimum goal

So 65k -10k I spend on the car -1K tax/getting the car ready = 54k + 36K from saving in the next 2 years should leave me realistically with 90K when I leave the house, wich should be enough to buy a house with 2, probably not enouf to buy a small (say 210K) house alone (I on my own can rent about 145k/ 25 years calculated with a simple online tool at the highest interest rate at the moment)


SO do you think I can afford this dreamcar of mine or would it be pretty dumb, from my point of view it looks like I could live without those 10k extra.
Buying a fast-ish petrol car is never going to be ""smart"", thats obvious, thats why I'm asking opinion here, collegues at work think 18k for a car isn't that much, my mom and grandpa for example think its crazy Because ""you can get a brand new one for 10k"" and ""your current car is great why would you ditch it)
its worth mentioning that I'm willing to save on other things if needed

ALSO I know this might seem like a stupid question but I really want to make sure I can afford to do this and not get in trouble when I go living on my own in 2 years.
ALSO I'm asking this here and not on a car forum because well, they will always say yes.

Thank you for reading my very long first post and I would like to hear your toughts/opinion if its no problem at all or if I'm being blind.

- Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction (Raul Rojas)

- A Brief Introduction to Neural Networks (David Kriesel)

1. I'm making three payments on my Federal loans, although I see it's technically broken up into smaller ""sub-loans""? Do I essentially average the sub-loans interest rate in order to see the overall interest rate for that loan itself? (i.e. my first loan would be a 6.53% rate?)  
2. In regards to my Discover loan, how is it possible I borrowed less money than I owe in principal balance right now after paying it for 4 years? This loan has been split and moved around to different companies over the course of time, is it due to this? Something doesn't make sense to me regarding this.  
3. I have been saving literally every penny I can for the last years and expending minimal funds in order to get rid of my looming debt. Where exactly should I be utilizing my flexible $18,000 in the bank? I'd like to free up some monthly payments if I can.

personalfinance,"PF Wiki Steps Complete, Now What?","Hi all,

PF noob here (literally and figuratively). I read the PF Wiki and the rules so I hope my post doesn't break any rules or duplicate an already existing post, but I digress.

The only debt I have is my mortgage and car loan. I refi'd the mortgage to 3% and 15 years recently starting at 180k, and have 4 years left on the car loan (.9%) that was originally 27k.

I have a steady career with the federal gov't, and I put 10% in my TSP and have been for years. I'm in the particular fund that is set up for 2040 retirees.

I have several months of emergency funds in a savings account, and I also put $100/month in a college investment plan for my son (his mother contributes $100/mo as well).

So what do I do if I'm completely ignorant on the stock market? I put a small amount in an Edward Jones portfolio back in the day, only to lose in the short term (yes, I know it's a long game, but it still sucked). I used to coach and play online poker semi-professionally and took my money out of Edward Jones to reinvest in myself in poker and made money that way. I don't play online poker anymore since that was essentially killed for American players, and I don't really have an interest in learning about the stock market. Should I keep my extra funds just sitting in my savings account or put it somewhere? Again, I'm not looking for this to become a hobby. I have no interest in learning the ins and outs. I just think that I'm probably not maximizing my $ by letting it sit in a savings account and was curious if I should give Edward Jones or something similar another chance.

Yesterday, I filled out a pre-application with a large, well-known, US bank and I was almost immediately quoted a 15yr Fixed at 3.375% that was exactly what I'd been looking for.

personalfinance,[Help] Collection agency contacted me today (ill-informed college student),"Sorry for not posting on moronic Monday thread (really freaking out) and thank you for whoever takes the time to read this and I apologize in advance for any grammatical errors/lack of information; this week has already been and continues to be very stressful. I am a senior in college and I just received notice by phone from a collection agency [(I hope this is legit](http://www.performanceportfoliony.com/)) about a $600+ balance that I didn't know was accruing until now. I have limited background when it comes to personal finance so please bear with me. I read the sidebars about debt, collections, and would like additional help/input, if possible.

I attend college in PA but permanently live at home in NYC. For 3+ years now I have been signed up with my local gym [(see reviews here)](http://www.yelp.com/biz/synergy-fitness-clubs-astoria) and a contract was signed for my monthly payments for membership with my debit card on file. They have given me free freeze periods for when I go back to school but occasionally I have been mis-charged during my freeze periods and have had to go through the trouble of proving my account was frozen from 100+ miles away. Earlier this year in January/February, I finally got fed up after I was mis-charged yet again and they refused a refund so I disputed it with my bank. I showed them evidence of my freeze period and my bank refunded me my money and recommended that I get a new card, so I did.

My ignorant self thought this would be the end of my relationship and issues with the gym but of course a balance was accruing because I never gave 30 days cancellation notice by mail (even though they'd just claim to lose it, according to reviews). Also, I signed this contract years ago and don't remember them ever explaining any of these policies to me. Considering I just got my first credit card earlier this year and how excited I have been about carefully building my credit these past few months, you can imagine my disbelief and feeling of dismay when this collection agency called and told me about my debt.

I should have known better with my past experience with this gym but now I am told I owe $6xx for a balance I didn't get anything out of. The CA told me this has not been reported to the credit bureau yet. I know it is too late and out of question to bother arguing with my gym (seriously, read the reviews for a laugh at my stupidity), although I did call and waste 30mins explaining to the person who picked up and said they'd get back to me tomorrow. I am not expecting a lot. I have never been given warning/notice about this from the gym and again, I am unsure of what the contract even says but don't doubt there is a lot in the fine print. The person from the CA told me on the spot that I could get this reduced to $400 at $100/month. She told me my actual balance was about $3xx with the other $2xx from late fees and my card being declined every month. My membership was about $45/month and should have been charging from July-October so I'm not sure about the exact balance. I requested an email of the notice that was sent to my home with the details and haven't had the chance/courage to ask my family to check for it yet.

Supposedly this hasn't been reported to the credit bureau (I believe that's what the lady on the phone called it) but it can ben reported at any time. I can probably work out a payment plan but don't want to push my luck in reducing the debt, unless I can. If I am going to pay for a service that I haven't been using, I want to pay as little as possible. I said that I would get back to the CA around Monday after this week of academic hell is over. 

So I am stuck here wonder how should I move forward from this? How bad will this look for my credit? How much time do I have before this will impact me? How much can this impact me? Is this a scam? Is the [CA](http://www.performanceportfoliony.com/) legit? Can my bank get involved since they've agreed with my dispute over this company before? How much can I possibly talk this outstanding balance down to from $6xx if the CA was willing to go down to $400, if at all? (The CA lady said we could further negotiate once I figure out how much I could possibly pay and at what kind of payments, I said I'd discuss with my parents. She mentioned a deposit?) Is lump sum payment or monthly payments better? Can I expect interest? Is this even the right subreddit to be asking this? Should I take down the CA/gym info from this post? Should I do this on a throwaway account?

I would really appreciate any input before I tell my mom (she is going to kill me). Thank you for your time",finance,1445985579

personalfinance,[Help] Parents are desperate to sell the house/business but the bank won't refinance our loan/remove their lien,"Hi PF,

My parents own a building that consists of a second floor residence and a first floor commercial space. My mother also owns and operates her own business out of this commercial space. 

Given my parent's mediocre credit history, we first received our loan to purchase the building in 2003, on the condition that the bank places a lien on our business through the duration of our repaying the loan. They currently owe the bank roughly $300K for the mortgage. Things have been fine for the past 12 years or so, we never missed a payment and we were never late. The only gripe from my parents during those years is that the interest rate was too high (~7%).

Fast forward to the present - both my parents are physically exhausted. They've been working 9-7, 7 days a week and are ready to call it quits. They've been desperately trying to find a buyer who can take their business off their hands but only found 2 over the past 4 years. We currently have one buyer in line with all the paperwork signed and ready to go. The only hiccup is that the bank still has a lien on our business, which means we'll need to get the bank's approval and have them remove the lien by perhaps placing it on the property itself, instead of the business. 

The problems are manifold:

1. The bank's underwriter is sending us strong signs that they will not approve of the removal of the lien on the business onto the property or any transaction that would involve another party being responsible for making the mortgage payments due to the fact that my parents have a high debt-to-income ratio, mediocre credit scores, and a few other factors.
2. The buyers are getting very impatient and are ready to call it quits.
1. Hanging onto the business is not an option for my mom. She'd sooner declare bankruptcy than continue working and paying the bank. She also said she'd use my name and credit score to land herself an apt or car if she were to go bankrupt... and believe me, my dad and I have been trying to talk some sense into her.
1. (A little more personal and likely irrelevant) My mom **needs** to get a biopsy done on an abnormality in her chest, but she is dead-set on selling the business/property first, before she can worry about her health. Our desperate pleas for reason/logic utterly falls on deaf ears. 

Per our lawyer, here are some potential solutions and why they won't work:

1. My parents could find a co-signer which would boost the bank's confidence and help our case with the underwriter, but the only person who they know that would even remotely consider it is me (25M earning 65K), but I'm **very** hesitant to take on such a burden.
1. We could turn around to the buyer and suggest that they purchase all the business's equipment and pay us a small monthly rent, and let them know that perhaps in a year's time we could reassess the lien with the bank and transfer the business title over to them if it's approved. But the buyer's lawyer will advise against it and they likely aren't stupid enough take that risk.
1. We could sit down with the bank reps/underwriter and be completely candid with them, that this buyer is our best (and only) chance to make monthly payments, because my parents physically cannot maintain the business. And maybe even talk some sympathy into them. But I was informed by the lawyer that this may backfire on us, since we're essentially revealing our hand to the bank. 

We'd be grateful for any advice on how we can best navigate through this.",finance,1445996332

personalfinance,Questions Regarding Employer Matching and 401k Distributions,"So I recently started my 401k. I have the option of Roth or Traditional, and I have some questions that I can't find answers to. First of all, I have read that all employer matched funds are what would be considered ""traditional"" in that they are tax deferred. 

For example, I make 100k a year, and my employer matches 100% of the first 5% of my paycheck I contribute to 401k. Let's say I have a Roth. I only invest up to the employer match, and so by the end of the year I have $3500 (5% of 100k=$5000 - $1500 in taxes) Adding in my employers contribution and negating any profit from investments, I have $8500 in my 401k. Let's say that I am retired now, and I have a gigantic sum of $8500 in my 401k.

Am I correct in assuming that 3500/8500 of my total is money that I can pull out tax free, and that the other 5000 I must now pay taxes on upon withdrawal?

Second, *how* do I pay taxes on this money upon withdrawal after retirement? Are 401k withdrawals considered income, and if so are they federally taxed the same way? (I pay W% up to X dollars, and then Y% up to Z dollars?) Am I taxed at my current income's marginal tax rate, or is the tax based on the amount of money I am withdrawing?

If this is the case, what is stopping me from doing the following: I have a traditional 401k, and now I'm retired and I have 100k in my 401k, and I want to withdraw 90k. Why wouldn't I withdraw $9000 10 times, for a tax rate of 10%, instead of withdrawing 90k all at once and losing roughly 1/3 of it?

My last question: if a 401k is comprised of Roth contributions as well as Traditional, is there some golden balance between the two that I should strive for?",finance,1445997581

Originally I was planning to equate 30% of my monthly $1500 to go towards my students loans and save 20%. The remaining 50% would be wiggle room and play money. 

I've had friends tell me with my student loan interest rate that it's better to save and invest more money than go towards pushing hard to pay off my loans quickly.

personalfinance,[CREDIT] Pay off student loan with credit card,"Hey Guys, 

I need some advice. I have a student loans to pay off. But, there are some credit offers which give 0% APR for 12-15months. Some examples are Chase Slate or Blue Cash Preferred: I have a good credit score so I am sure I can get those cards. However, there is a problem. FedLoans does not accept credit cards. They only accept money orders, bank accounts. I talked to my FedLoans customer service and they suggested I can either get a cash advance (which doesn't work because of 20% APR), or I can use a gift card with account/routing numbers. I can potentially buy a gift card with my credit card, and it would count as a purchase within the 60-day window. 

I am completely sure I can pay off my loan in the 12-15 months. I'm really only doing this for the interest rate reduction.

For the past 6 months, my private student loan payments have been over $1,200 a month, and my federal loan payments are $300 per month. I commute an hour to and from work each day, and fill my tank up each week (~$45 a week depending on the gas prices that week). I have over $92,000 in student loan debt, I barely make my payments each month, I use my credit card for gas and food because I don't have the cash in my bank account. I'm literally living paycheck while living with my parents rent free.

What do I do? The rep from Navient blatantly told me that they won't lower my payments, SoFi wont refinance my loans even with a parent cosigner, which I thought was my ticket to lower payments and finally having a savings account. I'd like to move in with my girlfriend in the next couple years but I won't do so without a savings, but getting to the point where I have a savings seems like it's going to take decades. Any and all advice welcome.",finance,1446000940
gaming,An Open Letter to 343 Industries and Microsoft - Re: Halo 5,"To 343 industries: 

I'm going to start this open letter by stating plain and simple: I did not play your new game. 
I chose an Xbox one over a playstation 4 largely because of my deep love for Halo. 
I pre-ordered it back months ago, and have been counting down sleeps until the carnage could begin. 
I re-played every game in the Halo franchise, getting ready and re-honing my mad skills. 
I ventured out to my local game store today, sick, drugged up but optimistic, I knew I would be feeling better as soon as I delivered some magnificent death. 
I came home, installed your game and waited for it, and the update to finish. 
I made dinner early, awaited the arrival of my husband and we stuffed down my beef stroganoff as fast as we could without choking to death. 
Finally - it was time... Lights down, volume up, blackout curtains drawn and enough beverages and snack foods to feed a small army spread out on the living room table. 
The screen dims - and there is is: that iconic Halo theme song...

Pulse quickens and I adjusted my pillow for maximum gaming comfort. It's about to go DOWN. 

Within five minutes, I came to realize something that I somehow neglected to understand. Something that, I didn't even ever thing to check. 

No
Local
Co-op.

Since my first Xbox, Halo has been my jam. I own all of the collectors editions, box sets, collectibles and guides. 
I have enjoyed all of it, and this was supposed to be no different. 

However on this day - I lost my faith in the video game industry, and in you. 

Halo has been, and always will be a co-op game. Never have I even once played it alone. It has been an adventure taken with friends, boyfriends, and most recently I introduced my husband to the joy that is Halo. 

Congratulations on ruining YEARS, a decade of groundwork on a franchise that was nothing short of amazing. 

Whatever bullshit ""technical excuse"" you have for this massive error in judgement, you can deposit in the box marked ""I don't give a fuck"". 

Please consider this my official resignation from the Halo fan club. While the game store will likely not let me return my copy as it was opened, I will lie and say it doesn't work and accept store credit. 
If that fails, I will be posting a YouTube video of me lighting your game disc on fire, and then tossing it into a pile of dog shit in my back yard. 
I will be unfollowing you on Twitter. On facebook. 
I will be openly bashing you on every social media outlet I can at every opportunity that I have. 
I hope to one day visit a convention like Pax or E3 and throw something at your booth. 
I hope that Bungie is rolling over laughing at the sheer size of your error, and crying because you destroyed their legacy. 

I also hope, that this letter reaches you through the magic and power or reddit, and that the community shares this as a sign of solidarity and disgust in the complete hacks that you are. 

Thank you, for putting and end to a decade of love and enjoyment. I sincerely hope that the fanbase dies and your company goes belly up, and bungie or someone with some fucking integrity takes back over. 

Sincerely, hatefully and completely heartbroken,

CISA passed because US companies are tired of being constantly attacked online. They are hemorrhaging money and/or losing the public's trust.

Currently I have $2,750 in loans, $1,000 of which is unsubsidized and $1,750 of which is subsidized. I have an interest rate of 4.290% and so far have about $7 in accrued interest.

My question is, what is the best course of action to take to minimize how much I have to pay? and what other tips for the future are necessary for me to know?

I have the option to either apply my payment as a refund or as a payment. The refund will reduce how much I borrowed from them, and therefore apparently my interest will be calculated accordingly. My other option is to apply it as a payment.

I am also unsure as to whether I should stick to just paying off the interest rate or start making actual payments as well.

personalfinance,Should I take a loan against my PSRP (profit sharing retirement plan) to pay down CC debt?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I am in my mid-twenties and work for a large-ish company in the United States. Due to some general idiocy in the last few years, I managed to rack up about USD7k in credit card debt. I have a plan to pay these off, and am feeling pretty good about this plan. I learned recently that my company offers an option to take out a loan against your PSRP which you then repay to yourself (with interest, to yourself) and think it might be a good option to more quickly pay down these debts.

I know that ""do not take a loan against your retirement plan!"" is gospel here and in the personal finance world in general. However, this seems to differ to me because it would be a loan to myself, which is repaid to myself, with 3.25% interest to myself. I chatted about it with several coworkers who have strong financial backgrounds and they said the only reason you would not take advantage of this option is if the stock market suddenly performed at 22% (the APR of the credit cards). Since there is little chance this will happen (my PSRP has been performing at 3.1% this year), it seems like it might actually be a good option.

Is there something I am not thinking about? This would allow me to pay off my credit cards (once and for all!) and the subsequent loan several months faster due to the lower interest rate. I would also have the PSRP loan fully paid back to myself within a year or 1.5 years (you can set the life of the loan). I couldn't find anything online about a PSRP loan so thought this might be a good place to turn for help. Thank you!",finance,1446039475

Dear Peter:

It is my experience that in Corporate America, even when all available data points to the same undeniable conclusion and when all stakeholders desire the same mutually beneficial outcome, an external force is often still required to effect meaningful and positive change. This is the current situation in which AIG shareholders find themselves. The company continues to severely underperform its peers and is now facing an increasingly onerous regulatory burden which will only further erode its competitive position. Despite definitive action on the part of Congress and regulators to encourage this company to become smaller and simpler by splitting up, you have shown no sign of urgency and have chosen a “wait and see…for years” strategy void of decisive leadership. As a result AIG consistently trades at a substantial discount to book value.  It is a “no-brainer” that the simple act of splitting this company up will greatly enhance shareholder value.  AIG should immediately:

Pursue tax free separations of both its life and mortgage insurance subsidiaries to create three independent public companies. Each would be small enough to mitigate and avert the Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) designation.
Embark on a much needed cost control program to close the gap with peers.
We believe there is no more need for procrastination, the time to act is now. I have already heard from several large shareholders who are frustrated with the lack of clear progress and are supportive of an AIG break up. I cannot fathom how you could ignore repeated requests from shareholders to execute a plan that would release billions of dollars of capital, free the company from onerous excess regulation, and leave shareholders owning stock in three separate, market leading insurance franchises.

“AIG is frankly overdue in following in the footsteps of all other major multi-lines in breaking up Life and P&amp;C into separate companies.  By separating into three independent companies, reducing unnecessary corporate overhead, operating at average industry returns, and buying back stock, AIG can trade at over $100 per share – 66% above its current $60 price,” John Paulson, President, Paulson &amp; Co. Inc.

 

Too Big to Succeed

“We’re beginning to see discussions that these capital charges are sufficiently large it’s causing those firms to think seriously about whether or not they should spin off some of the enterprises to reduce their systemic footprint, and frankly, that’s exactly what we want to see happen.”  Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen, February 2014

Despite years of dismantling and selling non-core assets, AIG is still too large. The combination of life insurance and p&amp;c insurance into a single entity offers no net benefit to shareholders (proven by industry low ROE), a fact that has driven other major multiline insurers to aggressively focus on a single line of business.  We believe you must acknowledge that the current multiline strategy is not generating competitive returns. Separate monoline companies will be more focused, more efficient, generate better returns and, as a result, command significantly higher market valuations.

Additionally, “Because of AIG’s size and interconnectedness” the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has deemed AIG a non-bank SIFI, subjecting the company to Federal Reserve oversight and increased capital requirements. We believe you must acknowledge that enhanced regulation is intended to be a tax on size, designed to approximate the cost that large companies impose on the financial system. The regulators have made clear that the best outcome is for SIFI’s to shrink and “reduce their systemic footprint.” If nothing is done, returns and AIG’s competitive position will continue to suffer as the SIFI regulation, including its costs and capital requirements, is fully implemented.

“The other way it [the FSOC Designation Process] can make the system safer is by providing an incentive for designated companies to change their structure or operations so they can reduce the risk they pose and change their designation and the amount of oversight. In many ways [this] outcome is more desirable than the first because it would allow business to find the more efficient way to reduce the risk they pose to the economy.” Senator Elizabeth Warren at Secretary Lew’s testimony before the Senate Banking Committee,  March 2015

We believe you should immediately pursue, in the quickest and most efficient manner, a separation of both life and mortgage insurance from the core p&amp;c insurance business. We believe all three companies would be small enough to avert the increased capital requirements and regulations associated with non-bank SIFI status. In the face of a changing and potentially punitive regulatory framework, you must realize that insurance businesses of AIG’s caliber are more valuable to shareholders if held directly than they are as part of a SIFI conglomerate.

 

Competitive Cost Structure

AIG’s ROE is below its peers not only because of size and capital constraints, but also because of lack of cost control. You have acknowledged that returns are below peers and must be improved, even going so far as to provide a long-term ROE goal of 10%, which is still below peers. At the same time you have suggested returns would not increase by more than 0.5% per year. Amazingly you have turned the quest for a 10% ROE into a half decade journey. The one thing we do agree on is AIG’s lack of competitiveness. Do you honestly think now is not the time for the inevitable AIG transformation?  You must be proactive and commit to closing 100% of the ROE gap between AIG and its peers.

It is now incumbent upon you to explain why, despite pressure from the stock price, regulators, and shareholders, the company should not take immediate and transformative action. Achieving these two goals in combination with continued share repurchases is the only realistic path to a healthy and competitive company and, more importantly, exceed the potential of any alternative plan. AIG has taken too long already and we hope you come to the same conclusion.  Time is of the essence.  We look forward to engaging with management, the Board, and shareholders.

Sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Carl C. Icahn",finance,1446042864

personalfinance,"Considering courthouse marriage to save money, bad idea with taxes?","My fiancé and I are getting married in June 2016. He was recently promoted and his insurance coverage is infinitely better than mine and much cheaper. As a result we are considering getting married prior to our ceremony and reception.

I currently make about 38k a year working hourly. I also have about 170k in loan debt from grad school (consolidated interest rate) and 2.3k in credit card debt which I am currently paying off. I have about 900 dollars in savings (it was a bit more but I made a large student loan payment).

My fiancé was promoted about 3 weeks ago. Previously he was working hourly and probably making around 30-32k a year (irregular hours). His promotion resulted in him now making about 48k a year (salaried). He has no loan debt and just got his first credit card. He also receives some amount of money from family property once a year, usually around 1-3k depending on how well business has gone on that property. I believe he currently has about 2k in savings.

My insurance policy premium goes up 120 dollars after January 1. I have to opt in or out by December 15. I started looking into taxes and I am worried that getting married on December 31 or earlier would result in he or I (or both of us) owing money on our taxes (as we would be filing jointly for 2015). As a result, I was thinking it would be best to wait until after December 31 to do this.

I am not extremely well versed in all of this and I realize my loan debt creates some issues. Since I have been and am actively applying for jobs I am hoping I'll be able to make more money soon by using my degree, but obviously that is partially just dependent on the job market.

My fiancé's family has a ""tax guy"" so we will hopefully also consult with him soon. Any thoughts or suggestions?

EDIT: I guess, to clarify, I'm asking:

1) If getting married in January 2016 and June 2016 would result in the same method of taxation (basically we would be filing as a married couple for our 2016 taxes, not 2015)

2) In what instances would being married change what we owe in taxes? Every year I've filed as a single person (hovering between 29k and 35k while I was in school), I didn't owe any money and actually got a return. 
Would our incomes being in a higher bracket, along with other changes because of the marriage, result in us owing money if everything else is the same? He has owed money previously because of the money he gets yearly from his family's earnings on the property they own.

personalfinance,Offered Payment Arrangement for Defaulted Students Loans. Do I take it?,"I defaulted on multiple private student loans taken out with Sallie Mae, now Navient. The last payment I made was in April of 2012. The total amount owed right now is about $88,000. I haven’t answered a phone call in years and have ignored previous lump sum settlement offers.

This week I received a letter from Allied Interstate offering a payment plan of $250 per month for 352 months, with the first payment due 11/18, and an interest rate of .001% after I enter into the agreement as a part of Navient Reduced Interest Rate program

My financial state has improved since 2012 and I can afford this payment without any worries. I knew I was pretty far gone with damaged credit, and the plan was to wait on a settlement I could afford and rebuild from there. I’m looking at this as an opportunity to essentially start fresh (minus all the negative aspects of defaulting in the first place) 30 years, 250/month, no interest. If I was making regular payments on this account and had it in good standing, I’d be paying over 500 a month, and in 30 years have paid 100k of interest on top of the principal, so this does feel and seem like a major opportunity to get myself in a plan to start moving on with making right the mistakes from years past.

I am curious about the following:

How will this be reported to credit agencies? I am attempting to climb out of the credit rating basement, and can only see this helping over time, as the original charged off original accounts fall off of my credit reports.

What potential downfalls are there in entering into this program?
In these types of circumstances, are there typically pre-payment penalties? With almost 0% interest, it would make sense to use these affordable monthly payments to worry about other debt and only then make larger payments on this account.

Am I missing something obvious?",finance,1446049449

personalfinance,[US] Should I stop tax withholding to minimize return?,"I started a new job this fall after being a student (no income) the entire rest of the year. I am filing single, no dependants, no other deductions (except 401k given below). I am looking for a sanity check on my thoughts and calculations. 

My AGI for the year should be approximately $33000, however it appears my withholdings are configured to tax me as if my income was for the full year. By the end of the year, I will have contributed $3800 to a pretax 401k.

So far in the year I've had $3288 federal withheld. Checking a few refund estimating sites as well as my own calculations, I believe i should pay $2854 federal total (taxable income: $22105).

personalfinance,Bank might have screwed up &amp; cleared a LOC I defaulted on,"backstory:
I was 20 years old, got a Line of Credit with high interest rate from HSBC for 10 grand. Racked up an amount of $7000, lost my job, couldn't afford to pay it back. this was 6 years ago. It went to collections, and I've been just sort of paying them $100 here &amp; there until I am a better position to settle the balance.

I got an offer to settle for $4000 last week. I am almost in good enough financial standing now that I could take out a loan at a good interest rate through my bank (would be lower than the interest rate on balance now). In order to do this, I have to pay off one small debt I have first. My bank financial advisor told me she wouldn't attempt to secure the loan based on the information I gave her as it would impact my credit rating if I was denied. Advised me to go look at my online credit report and get back to her on that information.

So I did. I went to equifax and got my credit report.

Here's where it gets weird. There are 2 HSBC accounts on my credit report, despite me only ever having one. one is for an amount of $0, the other is for $1200. not the $10000 I applied for. BOTH accounts say ""account paid &amp; up to date, closed at consumer request"". None of the accounts say that they have gone to collections (which happened about 4 years ago).

I spoke with the collections agent today, and casually mentioned this, which might come back to bite me. But she said that this is extremely odd and she's never seen this before. Given how much the balance is that I owe, and how none of it is showing up on my credit report.

My question is, where do I go from here? If the account says paid &amp; closed, do I get a written confirmation from HSBC and walk away? If I stop paying the collection agency, on what legal grounds can they come after me if the account they are pursuing is technically ""closed &amp; paid""",finance,1446054612

We are working on funding our wedding with no outside help (budget $20k), and I've been working on slashing my expenses in the last few months. 

I was paying $850 a month in rent and moved in with him. He covers our rent, so I have no rent payment anymore. I also lived at home for two years after graduating college with $42k in debt, and have managed to pay off $38k so far. I started with the highest interest rate loans first and am working my through from highest to lowest. He gave me his old car (which is paid in full) when my lease ran out so I can focus my paychecks on saving for a wedding and retirement. I've been trying to save little by little for retirement, was inspired by this subreddit and have managed to cut my spending from almost 100% of my paycheck (including student loan) to a third. 

Monthly income: $3280
Monthly spending: $1150 
Monthly savings: $2000

2k cash
4.5k 401k
1k IRA 
4.1k remaining student loan debt

I paused contributing to my employer 401k to focus on paying down debt and putting money away for the wedding. Wondering how you all keep focus on FI with major life moments. Also wondering where I can simplify my budget even further to squeeze out more for early retirement. 

I feel like I've slashed my spending as much as I can. 
Budget:
$70 gas/fuel
$60 parking (I work downtown and this is the cheapest lot)
$120 cell phone 
$60 student loan (readjusted to minimum payment)
$40 coffee shops
$370 groceries (covers both of us)
$200 restaurants (covers both of us)
$50 gym membership
$100 personal care (for haircuts, but I rarely use this so it gets put into savings)
$100 clothing (rarely used monthly, but big ticket items like a new winter jacket and a new pair of boots a couple of times a year spend this line item)

I'd love any insight into where you think I could keep slashing and how to prioritize early retirement with paying off student loan debt and saving for a wedding (planned for next year -- 13 mos from now). As it currently stands, I've paused any FI/RE saving and have been allocating $2k/month to my savings acct for wedding expenses. Is that a huge mistake?

personalfinance,Thinking about switching entirely to online banking,"I just switched my emergency fund to Ally from Capital One 360 because of the higher interest rate. I've had the 360 account for like ten years, back when it was ING, but I have a healthy amount in there now and that 0.25% actually makes a decent difference.

Once I reached my goal for my emergency fund I opened a second 360 savings account where I stash spare cash away after all my bills are paid for the month. The second account is kind of a short-term thing where I'm saving money for something specific like a vacation or I just want to have a few extra hundred bucks on top of my emergency fund, for home repairs or whatever. I'll be moving that over to Ally too.

Now that I'm taking the time to switch all this over I'm wondering why I don't just get an Ally checking account too. I've been with Wells Fargo (formerly Wachovia) for 15 years and I guess when I think about it, there's really not much of a NEED for me to have a real bank. Especially if I can use any ATM with Ally. I very rarely use cash unless I'm going to the nail salon once a month or something. The ONLY time I had an issue with online banking (Cap 360) was when I was moving money around when I bought my house and I couldn't deposit a $10,000 check into my 360 savings. They had a deposit limit or something.

I'm just trying to think this through because, though I don't need the services of a real bank 99% of the time, I don't want to end up in a pinch again. Like if I had a $10,000 check I needed to deposit and there's a limit, what the heck would I do then?

I like the idea of having all my money in one bank and it would make things a little easier as far as moving money from checking to savings and back again. Am I correct that if you have a checking and savings account with Ally, the funds transfer immediately? None of this ""5 days to become available, 2 days to withdraw again"" stuff right?

I'd love to be able to keep both the Wells Fargo checking while I try out Ally, but there are all these rules I have to follow with the checking account to not get charged a monthly fee. If I'm using the Ally one as my primary account, I won't meet those criteria and will have to pay $12/month for the other checking account.",finance,1446057430

So basically I'm in a situation where I might have to take on student loans. The problem is that I really don't want to start out my life in debt.. I'm wondering if any kind of financial aid would work out for me. Here's the situation:

1) My dad's income is at least over $80,000 (probably somewhat over 100k).

2) My mom's income is about $38,000.

3) My parents are divorced. I am in my Junior year of highschool. Every year my parents alternate on me being a dependent on their taxes. My dad additionally pays alimony to my mom.

4) My grades are average (3.65 GPA, but I'm trying to hopefully get to 3.80 by my Senior year). I do not do sports of extracirriculars unfortunately...

5) I have $12,000 in college savings. Instate tuition + all other costs will be $24,000 / year.

6) I plan on getting a degree that will pay (i.e. most likely nursing, or some kind of STEM).

Please tell me how I can better qualify for financial aid. I am not a ""minority"" although I am Middle Eastern (there is no affirmative action for that, so the government sees me as white).

If I'm missing any info, please ask me. I really need some help. Any information will help! I will write down / save anything I see that's important. I don't have anyone else to ask these questions to, and my dad has a history of being manipulative and lying.

Do you think I should get the core classes out of the way by doing them at a community college and then going to the public university?

Should I ask my dad to have only my mom state me as a dependent on taxes from now on?

I am curious about savings bonds. My current interest rate for the $12k I have in my savings account for college is 0.30%. I am wondering if putting that into savings bonds (I really don't know much about it) would be more effective? As I mentioned, I'm in my Junior year of highschool, so I'm going to college in 2 years.

Apparently, when I received my card &amp; info in the mail 3-4 weeks later, they decided to upgrade it to spend $2000 for 50k bonus miles. I did not realize this. 

A few weeks later, I was on the Chase website and I verified the original offer to make sure I had spent enough. The $1000/30k offer was listed, there was no $2000/50k offer mentioned anywhere. 

Today (about fives months after getting the card) I called to inquire about my bonus miles. This is where I learned that my application had actually processed for the 50k deal, and I didn't spend enough and there was nothing they could do. I would have absolutely spent enough if I knew - that's not a problem - but because the card has a high interest rate I've only been using it for flights (free checked bags). 

They told me my best option would be to close the card, and reapply to ""try for the bonus again"". I thought it was insane that this was all they could do, but what do I know. 

Isn't that bad for your credit score though? I'm irritated and want to close the card on principle, but the free checked bags are nice. Likewise, I really want those bonus miles - I fly United frequently because my airport is a hub. 

What should I do? Is there some way I could still get my miles? Is closing/reapplying ridiculous? Should I just close on principle because I am no longer interested in supporting them?

personalfinance,Never financed a vehicle before? Tips for First Time Buyers!,"Hello r/personalfinance !

The purpose of this thread is for those of you looking to finance a new or used vehicle for your first time. If you have any additional advice, feel free to comment for others to see. If you feel that I have provided incorrect information, please let me know and I will clarify or review the issue.

First off, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Rich, and I have been in the car sales business for quite some time. I have worked in almost every facet of a dealership from service technician to my current position of Finance Manager. I have worked in finance for several years, including the #1 Honda dealership in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as a few independent dealerships and have seen just about every type of credit score/history that you can imagine. 

I would like to go over a few misconceptions when purchasing a vehicle from a dealership. 

**1. ""How much money do I need to put down?""**

 A. This is almost always the first question asked by customers when they are looking to finance a vehicle. There is not an exact amount needed to put down on a vehicle, unless advertised as a requirement to obtain a certain pre-calculated monthly payment. The amount of down payment needed is almost always decided by the bank reviewing your application. The down payment determined by the bank is used to lower the monthly payment to be more affordable for the customer. I would recommend asking to see if you can put $0 down first, and then see how much is needed if the bank requires a certain amount. If you tell a dealership you have $5,000 to put down on your purchase, the dealership will put that amount on the loan application. You may have only needed $2,000 down, but since you offered more the bank will take as much money as you are willing to give. If you can keep more money in your bank account instead of investing in your vehicle, try to go that route. You can always put down however much you would like to get to the desired car payment you are seeking.

**2. ""I have a 700+ credit score, why is my interest rate x.xx%?""**

A. The credit score is one of many factors when purchasing a vehicle, however it is NOT the deciding factor for a low interest rate. There are several factors that a bank considers before approving a person for an auto loan. They include but are not limited to; credit score, credit history, available credit, types of credit, etc. Each of these items are associated with a certain level of risk involved when determining what rate YOU deserve. On several occasions I have had customers with 800+ credit scores receive higher than expected interest rates due to having maxed out credit cards (high ratio of credit utilization) or they were currently financing a vehicle and attempting to finance a 2nd vehicle which resulted in a higher risk to the bank.

Okay, those are two major topics that more of us dealers answer on a daily basis. I will add a few more as I refine my thoughts about them.  

Now, lets talk about what is required to get approved for your first auto loan. Some items on this list may not include everything, but for the most part these are almost ALWAYS a good thing to bring with you to the dealership.

* Proof of Income (1-2 of your most recent pay-stubs WITH year-to-date income amount.)
* Valid Driver's License
* Proof of Residency (Utility/cable/cellphone bill or bank statement showing you live at the address you put on the application for the loan.)
* Proof of Insurance (you MUST have this by the time you are ready to leave with the car!)

Typically as a first time buyer, you need to have at least 6 months of employment at your current job, or if you recently started a new job then have had at least 2-3 years of similar experience at your previous job. This is based on the usual requirements from the banks I work with that have FTB programs. Some dealerships may have alternate programs available that require more or less work experience. Usually 6 months is a minimum standard as a way for the bank to determine your job security as well as a guideline for your average yearly income.

You should not have any derogatory credit (missed credit card payments, unpaid collections, medical bills, or cable/utility bills). For a first time buyer it is preferred if you have NO credit, or GOOD credit. A zero credit score is ALWAYS easier to work with than bad credit!

Depending on the amount you will be financing, you may be required to put $0 down, or at minimum 10% down (ie: $15,000 = $1,500 down), For my FTB programs, a minimum of 10% is a requirement.

Debt-To-Income (DTI) should be 50% or less (ie: if you make $3,000/month before tax your monthly expenses including rent should not exceed $1,500/month). If you live at home with your parents and do not pay rent, some banks automatically assume that you spend $500/month for cost of living (food, fuel, cell phone bill, transportation costs, miscellaneous, etc.) They will factor this in addition to any current credit cards, student loans, or anything else you pay monthly listed on the credit report.

Ideally, you should not spend more than 10-15% of your income for a monthly payment. (ie: $3,000/month income @ 10% = $300/month car payment &amp; @ 15% = $450/month car payment)

More often than not, the bank is already considering this factor and will make sure you cannot live past your means. (ie: they will not allow $650/month car payment on $3,000/month income.)

Dealerships have amazing relationships with the banks. Personally, I am very close with the underwriters over at Wells Fargo. They take me out to SF Giants games all the time and out to dinner once a month. Without hesitation, they will almost always give me an approval on a deal if I ask nicely. Why? Because they trust my judgement and I don't waste their time with people who cannot finance a turkey sandwich. Trust goes a long way in the car business between the dealership and the bank.

However, in some cases a dealer and bank may have a relationship that does NOT benefit the customer. If the dealer tries to tell you that you were approved for an outrageous car payment that you know is not affordable for your monthly income, get the hell out of there!

Pending you have good/great credit, make sure you ask what bank(s) approved you. If they got you approved with a credit union, then you should be getting the lowest rate available based on your credit! 

If you were approved with Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Bank of Stockton, Gateway One, Capitol One, or another large bank, chances are the dealership will mark up the interest rate. Most major banks will allow as much as a 2% markup, while some will allow 2.5%. A dealership cannot markup a rate more than 2.5% on a loan.

Yes, legally they can do this, as I markup rates all the time. As a finance manager, I am doing all of the footwork by collecting the the customer's information and processing all of the paperwork pending the approval. This is called ""dealer participation"" as the profit made from marking up the rate is paid to my dealership by the bank for ""taking care of business"". A portion of this profit is then paid to me for doing all of the work!

Legally, you also have a right to negotiate the rate if you can. For example, if you receive a rate of 4.89%, chances are the rate you actually received is 2.89%. The difference in your monthly payment due to this markup is $20 or so on your monthly payment, but at the end of the loan you will have paid an additional $1,200 or more!

Is it best not to make the dealership aware that you know they might have marked up your initial rate as they also have the right to refuse service to you and not sell you a car at all. The best way to do this is to ask them if they can get you a better rate, or tell them you are pre-approved by a credit union for 1% less than the rate they show you. Some finance managers may be willing to work with you and adjust the rate to make you happy, while others may insist that there is nothing more they can do. Keep in mind that you are basically negotiating that person's paycheck. I'm sure that if you had a customer determining how much you should get paid, you would be resistant to any reduction in profit that you are making. Us finance managers have to feed our families too!

personalfinance,"(CAN) New grad with 100k in debt, healthcare professional with good salary, best repayment approach?","Hey everyone,

I recently graduated earlier this year, I'm 25 years old. I completed 2 degrees in 7 years, I came from a very low-income family and I wanted to work hard to not have to live like that again. Unfortunately I had to fully fund my education with student loans and a student line of credit.


Here's my current debt situation:

$51,000 Canada Student Loan - Interest: 5.2%

$44,000 Student Line of Credit - Interest: 3.2%


The student loan was $61,000 but with savings and recent work I did put $10,000 lump sum on it last month. My current dilemma is whether I should make paying back the debt high priority or not. I make $43/hour and work around 40 hours per week. I also have the opportunity to do overtime work at other locations for $65/hour which I often do, I've been regularly doing double shifts multiple times per week at other places to make extra cash to put on my loans. Regularly average 60 hours per week at the end. Annually, around $100K-$130K possible. I try and save as much as I can after expenses each month with the goal of putting large lump sums on my debt. I estimate to be able to put $5000 on it every 2-3 months.


1. Would it be sensible to consolidate the student loan with the lower interest rate LOC? My calculated savings was ~$90-$100/month on interest if I did that, but seeing it all together as one big number would be much more intimidating.


2. I'm currently not paying my line of credit and solely focusing on my student loan, once that is paid off (or significantly less) I'll start making payments on the LOC. Does this make sense? For one year after school the interest is added to the LOC each month and no payments are required.


3. What about retirement savings/investing? I have an RSP through work, I contribute $150 each pay with my work matching 3-3.5%. Roughly $500/month RSP contribution altogether. Is that all I need for now while I focus on loan repayment?


4. All I do is work as much as I can, sleep, and eat with my main focus being to repay these loans. It's A LOT of money that just goes toward debt. I don't keep an emergency fund, because as soon as I reach a lump sum savings amount I just add it to my loan. Would anyone do anything different?


I definitely feel exhausted all the time working this much, and it's discouraging to simply pay off debt but it causes me a lot of anxiety to have this much and I just look forward to the day when it's zero. Being in school for so long I feel I don't have much financial ""sense"", I think I'm doing the right thing - but I'd appreciate any advice/if you think I'm not doing something I should be doing that I don't realize. All possible funds right now after expenses are going toward debt, and aside from my RSP contribution each month not saving/investing anything else. I like the idea of saving for a house, I just feel that would set me back with loan repayment.",finance,1446084325

I recently paid off the student loans that were directly in my name after 2 years and now I'm going to contribute to paying off that mountain.

Right now my budget looks like this

Income $3960 per month (this is after taxes and assuming I don't work over time which I do at least 2 times a month)

Rent $899

Phone $142 (it will be going down to $60 come Nov)

Internet $20

Electric $30

Hulu $8

Saving $600

Adobe CC $54 (I need this for work which makes me wonder if I can write it off on my taxes?)

Transportation $116


That if my math is right means I have $2200~ left at the end of the month with some wobble room for food (which I left out because month to month what I spend on food widely varies) which just barely covers the minimum payment on the loans which based on my math means it would take me 9 years to pay them off and I would pay $74,521.93 in interest in that time which is crazy! Right now theres a balance of $488.13 in owed interest that I've set a payment for friday to pay off on top of the already scheduled required payment. 

So I have two questions is there any feasible way for me to get a loan of equal value at a lower interest rate? And is there any other suggestion about what I could be doing to proactively tackle this loan?

I created a Credit Karma account last night and I have a question. One of the factors affecting my score is the length of my credit lines.

It claims I have 13 lines of credit when 11 of those are student loans. I thought that student loans did not affect your score unless you don't pay them on time?

personalfinance,which should i pay off first: credit card debt or federal taxes owed?,"i was little reckless with my spending/understanding of finances in my early 20’s and am trying to clean things up. i’m 29 and have always made payments mostly on time (towards student loans, which i currently have none of, credit cards, etc). my credit is surprisingly not terrible. i have around $4k in credit card debt spread across 3 different cards. 1 is interest free for another 12 months, one has about 14% interest rate, and the other is at about 23%. i also owe around $8,500 in federal taxes. 

i've been working pretty successfully at paying off my cc debt by putting the most towards the card with the highest interest rate, working it down with the plan to then move on to the card with the next highest interest. while i think i've managed to figure out the best way to pay down my cc debt (feel free to correct me if i'm wrong), i cannot for the life of me wrap my head around my federal tax debt and the interest and penalties associated with it. i've had payment plans with the IRS in the past but essentially stopped making payments because at one time or another i couldn't afford them. at some point i kind of just figured that the interest + penalties on my taxes amounted to less than the interest rate on my credit cards, so i should focus on my cc debt first. this was not an educated guess, but rather a guess born out of not wanting to crunch the numbers or really even knowing how to. 

i can't really afford to put money towards both my credit card debt and my federal tax debt. rather, i feel like if i split up what i can afford ($300 max per month) i'll essentially just be paying off interest on both and getting nowhere on either. i’m game to figure out a plan and stick to it, i just don’t really know where to start. 

am i by some miracle doing the right thing financially? help!

EDIT: wow ladies and gents, thank you so so much! i did not expect so many responses and i genuinely appreciate all of the thoughtful breakdowns and suggestions. i'm going to call the IRS and see if i can get back on an installment plan and look into getting a card i can transfer my higher interest debt to so i can pay it off relatively interest free. thank you thank you thank you!!",finance,1446102267

My spouse and I currently live in our home that we purchased a couple years ago. As we move onto our next home purchase, we are thinking about buying another home for her to start her own business (child care). 

&amp;nbsp;

To use a home for child care (6 kids and under) the home needs to be qualified as a primary residence. I travel for work 3-4 nights a week - during that time period she will be living in that home. On the weekends we will probably go back to our current home. 

&amp;nbsp;

So reddit my question is can she claim a different home as a primary residence while I live in another. Does that mean that we can qualify this new home with residential interest rate over investment when applying for the loan? are both homes exempt to capital gains tax when we sell (primary residence rule)?

financialindependence,"After retiring early, how much to allocate to cash, bonds, etc.?","In my accumulation phase I always kept an allocation of 100% equities other than my emergency fund, but am considering adjusting this now that I've just retired at age 45.  

I've seen the argument by some that keeping 6 months to several years worth of spending in cash, bonds, etc. can reduce risk after retiring by minimizing the need to draw down equities during a downturn instead of needing to sell equities every few months.  This approach can replace the need for a separate emergency fund as well since job loss is no longer on the table and a large enough amount can address the other risks a traditional EF would cover.

The counter argument is that permanently carving out a large amount from the portfolio to hold outside of equities can result in less growth in good times to overcome declines in bad times (especially in this low interest rate environment).  Because of this, the ""conventional"" wisdom of percent to hold in bonds = age seems way too conservative to support a long retirement of let's say 50+ years.

For those of you that have retired early, how many months/years of spending do you keep in cash, bonds, etc. and why?  Does your answer change to factor in sequence of returns risk (e.g. hold more in cash/bonds for first 5-10 years and then scale up more equities assuming all went well)?  

Where have you invested this, for example holding cash in savings accounts or CDs, directly holding bonds or investing in bond funds, what types of bonds, etc.?  How often do you replenish said fund of cash/bonds; e.g. opportunistically vs. regularly every x months?

I'm currently considering holding 6-24 months of spending in cash and/or bonds.  Cash would be in high yield savings (around 1%) since there isn't enough to be gained in a CD for this limited time span versus the loss in penalty free accessibility.  Not sure about bonds considering current returns.

Any pointers to data based analysis addressing the above would be appreciated.",finance,1446127411

[Basically, the Fed is likely to raise interest rates in December \(43% chance\)](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/29/us-usa-fed-idUSKCN0SM0BJ20151029). I have a re-financed private student loan through Wells Fargo at just under $30k @ 3.75% variable interest rate. 

If the Feds raise the interest rate, does my loan immediately go up? If it does go up, how does that affect the loan? Does my monthly payment change? Do they alert me when the interest rate changes or is it up to me to keep checking it?

personalfinance,How much should we spend on our first home?,"My wife and I are looking to purchase our first home in the coming months. Our biggest decision right now is whether to purchase a starter home or a longer-term home. That's where we need some opinions...
 
We both have excellent credit scores (750-790) and a combined salary of about $150K (more with annual bonuses). We're conservative spenders, so after speaking with a lender, we know we'll be pre-approved for more than we'd feel comfortable spending. So our options are...

* Starter home (Town home), $275-$375k 15 year fixed
* Mid-size house (single family) $375-450k 30 year fixed
* House to grow into $450-500k (30 year fixed).

We have enough money saved up to put 20% towards any of the options above...but would feel unsettling to drop $100k on a down payment.

We're leaning toward getting a starter home that is more affordable for us now and will leave us with more free cash flow. We'd plan to pay it off in 10-15 years and then sell to help pay for a larger home when we have school-aged kids. But with property-value appreciation and interest rates that will likely rise within 15 years, does it make more sense to purchase a longer-term home now?

Thanks!

Edit: I should also add that my wife and I don't have any kids yet but a good school system is important to us for the future and that is factored into the pricing above.

personalfinance,[Credit] ELI5: How are interest rates calculated on a credit card for balances during the month as charges and credits are made?,"I sent an email to my credit company asking this: 

&gt;I was wondering how my monthly interest rate was charged on my balance versus my payments and new charges.

&gt;At the beginning of October I carry a balance of $1200 on my statement, then during the month of October I make multiple payments that would bring this balance down to $600. During that time I make multiple charges that bring the balance back up to $900. 
&gt;
&gt;In this situation at the beginning of November when my statement is issued do I get an interest rate charge based on a percentage of $600 or $900?

My thought (and test I suppose this month) was that if interest isn't accrued until the end of the month then somehow I'd be saving a few pennies and paying down my amount slowly (if I charged 100 on the card, I'm paying 110 immediately within 24 hours).

Here's the response I got: 

&gt;Let me share that we calculate your interest charges each month using the following formula:
&gt;1. Divide your interest rate by 365 (days in the year).
&gt;2. Multiply this number by the number of days in your billing period.
&gt;3. Multiply this number by the balance subject to the interest rate.
&gt;4. Divide this number by 100.
&gt;
&gt;To calculate your balance subject to the interest rate, we start with any balance carried over from the previous day and add new charges or fees then subtract new payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance for one day.
&gt;
&gt;Next, we add together the daily balances for all days in the billing period and divide this total by the number of days in the period. This gives the balance subject to the interest rate for the billing period.
&gt;
&gt;I apologize I am unable to provide you with a generic example, because the number of days in you billing cycle may vary and the balance subject to the interest rate also varies depending on the number of days the balance remains on your account.
&gt;

personalfinance,[Taxes] How to calculate federal taxes on untaxed income?,"Hello Reddit I need your help for how to calculate federal taxes owed on untaxed income.

A little background, my fiancee [F] and I [M] took up a pet sitting job that we do on the side of our work lives.  We have started in mid-August and have been making a bit of good money from it. My fiancee handles all the contacting and transactions, and the money is in an account that we haven't touched yet. I don't ask to have any hand in seeing the account since I don't handle person to person interactions and money requests. Anyway, I estimate we are making about $1k per month on this and I want to be ready for the upcoming tax season. We will most likely go to a tax person in March, so that gives us 7 months to gain about $7k on it if we stay consistent. What I would like to know is how much of a percent of this amount should we set aside for paying taxes in tax season so we don't blow it all on accumulating expenses now and end up owing x amount later. 

Not sure if this info is needed, our working income is taxed, of course, and I'm estimating we will have a gross income of $80k. We will file jointly married since we were married by court early on after our engagement, but are having a formal marriage with family and friends later in the year. We aren't counting the court marriage as our ""legitimate"" marriage but the government will recognize us as married regardless.

Please, I'd like some direction on where to look for handling this. I know I have a lot of time before I really have to take action, but I'd like to have this peace of mind still. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!",finance,1446146021
personalfinance,Is there anything I can do about a closed medical bill showing up on my credit report?,"About 4.5 years ago, I visited my campus hospital at college and received medical treatment.  They were to send the bill to my parents, who I assumed would pay it.  During the time, my parents were moving and the bill did not get forwarded to their new address and ultimately did not get paid.
About 3 years ago, I received a call from a collections agency looking for payment for the bill.  After researching for a few days, my father and I ultimately decided that we still owed the money and I promptly paid it (roughly $200) to the collection agency.
Now, 3 years later, my wife and I are trying to buy a house and instead of getting a roughly 3.75% interest rate that we deserve, we are only getting offers of around 4.125%, which translates to about an extra $40 a month of interest because my credit is sitting in the mid 600's due to this closed collection.

I have researched this a bit and it seems that I have a few options, but I wanted the communities views on how/where to proceed.
1. The collection should fall off in about 4 years, which should allow my credit to be in good standing again before buying our next house.
2. I can call the issuer and ask them to stop reporting the collection and see if they will.  Although I don't know if it would be the hospital or the collection agency that I would need to contact.
3. Ask for proof of the collection and hope that it is replied to in 30 days, which would remove it from my report.

It seems like hiring someone more versed in this stuff would only lead them to do items 2 and 3 anyway, so I figure I can do that myself.  Are there any other ideas/stories of what you did and how effective it was?  Obviously it wasn't a mistake on their part, and I fully admit to owing the money and have paid it immediately once I found out, I am just not sure what to do about it now if anything.

Also, If I choose to just let it go and it falls off my report after 7.5 years, does my score immediately reflect that it isn't there?  Or does it slowly continue to improve over time, maybe just a little faster since that is off now?

personalfinance,Would getting another credit card increase my credit score?,"Hey PersonalFinance!

First time poster here. I finished my undergrad recently and was lucky enough to have minimal student loan and credit card debt. Altogether, I have about $13,000 in student loans and I have $2,000 in credit card debt. 

I've been following my credit score lately and the main factor that's been bringing my score down is my credit card utilization. (I don't have a low credit score by any means, but I know it could be better.) My CC utilization is ~80% and I'm paying this off regularly. I'm currently taking a year off before I apply to grad school and I've been working a full-time job that pays hourly. I get paid every week and I've been taking a little bit ($50-$100 depending on how much I spent that week) out of each paycheck to pay it off.

If I got another credit card and kept it below 30% utilization, would that increase my credit score since my CC utilization wouldn't be based on that one credit card with high utilization? That being said, if I did get another credit card, would they give me a higher interest rate since I have high CC utilization for my other credit card?",finance,1446153110

I'm about 18 months into a 30 year mortgage. I'm thinking of refinancing now, as my rate is currently 4.375%, and I could drop it probably by at least half a percent. 

However, the bigger deal is that my home value has increased significantly since purchase. That means I can drop PMI with a refinance. I'm scheduled to pay PMI right now for a long, long time as I bought on a 5% down conventional loan.

Would it be better to finance the closing costs into the new loan, or to pay a higher interest rate in exchange for lower closing costs, keeping the loan value closer to what is currently owed?
I don't have the exact numbers now, I just know those are the two options that will be available.

technology,My failed attempts to get decent internet in semi-rural TN,"More of a vent than anything else. but I've had a rough time trying to get internet to my house.

I'll start my story with the purchase of my new home 3 miles from my last house where I had Comcast for 10 years. The house is between 2 cities outside of Nashville, TN populations of the cities are 40k on one side and 6k on the other. i'm a little bit off the road but not as far as my neighbors. Moved here with my wife and 2 elementary aged kids. 

When looking at the house there were visible cable nodes in the street and all the neighbors had ATT (bellsouth area) DSL. I didn't expect much of an issue. 

I started with Comcast initially. residential service told me no service available. fair enough. i went to business class. They had me sign a form and do a site survey. Site survey came back with a build out cost of 3,750$ and with a 3 year contract Comcast out cover 3,500$. Great. I send a check for 250$ and wait. 3-4 weeks later I get a call from someone in Comcast. They inform me that they made a mistake on the survey and the nodes in front of my house did not belong to Comcast and they belonged to 'Small Town Cable' and they could not build out to me. They gave me the contact info for 'Small Town Cable' and that's the end of that attempt with Comcast.

Not a big deal right. So i try to call STC. ""The number you have dialed is not in service."" Apparently they have gone out of business. Well that's no good. I called Comcast back and let them know and they said they'd look into who owned those nodes now and I never hear back from them again.

That's fine. All my neighbors have DSL i can deal with slow internet. Better than nothing right?

So I call ATT. I get a standard all ports are full answer from them. I believe them initially and just try calling them every month or so thinking the answer will change eventually. They tell me there isn't a waiting list or anything i can sign up for i just have to call in and check occasionally. During this time i talked to an Ars Technica writer and he has this write up.

http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/06/internet-nightmare-att-sells-broadband-to-your-neighbors-but-not-to-you/

After 4-5 months of calling ATT my next door neighbor sells his house and the new buyer moves in and has ATT DSL installed on their move in date. furious the next day i call into ATT and push real hard on the service rep. I ask repeatedly 7 different ways to get a site survey done or to have a local ATT tech verify serviceability of my address and to get me off the phone he says he's going to setup and it would take 6 weeks to complete.

I go to twitter from there not wanting to wait 6 weeks and assuming the customer service guy was just trying to get me off the phone. and @ATTCARES on twitter gives me the same run around that my address is not serviceable. I may have gotten a little too belligerent with their twitter handle from that point. But either way I was fed up with AT&amp;T at that point.

Sometime in this time frame of dealing with ATT i get a Verizon hotspot with a10gb plan. We're within a 4g coverage area so the speed is fine, but normal use for internet for a family of 4 goes way over 10gb even without using any video streaming services. We're usually over our usage halfway through the month and the next plans up are just too pricey.

Next thing i work on is looking for who owns the STC cable nodes in our street now. My google-fu failed me completely on this. I eventually found out talking to a coworker that his parents used to have STC and when they went out of business another company took over their service. (I'll refer to this ISP as ISP2 to keep their name private.) So i look at ISP2's site and find out not only do they offer cable service they just rolled out FTTH gig service. i start running addresses to see and they have FTTH less than half a mile from me by phone pole distance.

So i call up ISP2 and give the girl my story. (keeping in mind this is a very small ISP that services 4-5 city's with FTTH service with populations anywhere from 5k-10k for these citys.) I offer to solicit my neighbors for their service as well. She says she'll talk to engineering and get back to me. 

After a week of hearing nothing back I track down the CEO's email address and email him directly. Asking him what i can do to for it to make business sense for him to build out into my area. I knew this was a shot in the dark and wasn't expecting anything from it. That evening he emails me back asking for a week to looking into it and gives me all his contact info. 

We had a few back and forth emails and eventually he crushed my soul with the answer of 

""I met with my engineering team and that address is clearly in AT&amp;T territory by 5 to 8 poles.  That would require ISP2 to seek a different license from the State that we do not have yet.  As such, we plan to re-evaluate this as part of our 2016 budget process and I will stay in touch. I know this is likely not the answer you want, but we are stock with our current designation right now and focused on finishing some significant upgrades we started earlier this year.  We have had quite a few similar requests over the last 12 months and plan to adjust our business plan to start accommodating some of these next year.""

I talked to a WISP that has a tower 4 miles from me but with the valley i'm in it would require me to pay for and put up a 40-50ft tower to get line of site and then that would cost quite a bit without knowing for sure what kind of speed i would really get from. That one is still on the table but i'm holding off for now.

That leaves Cellular and Sattelite as my only other options since cellular speeds are fine and both SAT and ell have caps I'm sticking with cell for now.  

Thanks for letting me vent all of this hear. If anyone knows anything about this license required to provide service over ATT in TN send me some info I haven't been able to find anything out from google on that one.

personalfinance,[CAN] TFSA rate at my current bank is lower than other banks. What can I do to increase this rate?,"As the title suggests, the current TFSA (Tax Free Savings Account) rate that I am set up with at my bank is lower than the other banks in Canada. The bank that I am currently with does have promotional interest time frames at a higher rate but the period is only for a few months at a time and personally I would prefer a constant higher rate. 

I would like to believe I have two options, and they are:

1) Transfer my funds from my current bank to another bank with a higher interest rate. This would ensure that I have the highest possible success rate in order to achieve a higher interest rate. However, there would be the task of transferring and closing the account which may be a tad difficult and may incur fees doing so.

2) Talk to a representative at my bank and determine if it is possible to have their rate match the competition. I would imagine this would be close to impossible to achieve, but if it is possible, it would make life a lot easier for me.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I would imagine an interest rate would be similar to item pricing at a department store. When a competitor of that department store has the same item on promotion, the department store will match the competitor's price in order to retain clients and business. Does a ""rate match"" policy apply to banks?

With regards to option 2, I am particularly interested to know if other Canadian PFers have done this and were successfully able to increase their rate at their current bank. If so, a few pointers would be greatly appreciated. Other information regarding this issue would be great as well.

investing,GBLI is a small cap stock with enormous upside and limited downside,"GBLI increased its book value per share by over 30% yesterday and no one noticed.  The company is repurchasing the shares from its largest shareholder, a private equity fund, at a 15% discount to market and a 35% discount to tangible book value.  Critically, GP of the PE fund and GBLI's controlling shareholder is staying in.  The company's book value per share will increase to $47.  It's trading at $28.  Liquidation value (its assets are primarily AA bonds so easily sold; my analysis shows liabilities potentially overstated) is mid-$40s.  If book value grows 7% a year as it has been doing even in this interest rate environment, book value becomes $65/share in five years.  The company can easily trade at 1.0x - 1.5x book value.  So the long-term upside is several turns and the fundamental downside is non-existent.  Someone will notice the transaction eventually, so the shares will rise in the short-term as well.

Does it mean the Fed isn't as worried as it once was about a possible economic slowdown? I think the FOMC is trying to downplay the role of global economic gloom may have on its decision and refocus on inflation and labor - its two mandates.
The Fed mentioned December as a possible timing to raise rates: The Fed only stated, as it should have, the following:
""In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation""
So if the labor market and inflation doesn't deviate by much from its current trajectory, the Fed is more likely to raise rates.",finance,1446221904
personalfinance,(CAN) Buying a house - saving for downpayment vs. getting loan for downpayment,"Hello PF, this is my first time posting here.

I would love to buy a house in the next 2 years, and I am actively saving for a downpayment. Houses in my area are pretty expensive, but I know you can get a solid fixer upper for 180 - 200 K, which is what I am aiming for. I would need probably ~30 K in reno costs, but I am willing to do them slowly, as long as the house is livable initially.

I've brought this up with my employer, (who I am friends with) and he is pretty adamant on not waiting to save up at least 30K and just getting a bank loan and using that as a downpayment. I feel hesitant about this and so I'd like some opinions. 

I live with my SO, going on 3 years now. I make about 38 000 before taxes, but I am an independent contractor (in CAN) so. I currently have about 10 000 saved, but that includes tax money, so I'd estimate maybe 5000 - 6000 actually saved. 

Now, an issue would be my SO. We are not married, and don't have a joint account. We split rent and food bills, but recently he has been having money issues. He needs a better paying job, and I have started to gently remind him to look for something. He makes 2000/month after taxes. I don't know his budget exactly, but it's something like this:

SO Budget:
Rent: 600 
Food: 100
Car Insur: 200
Gas: 200
Car Payment (until Jan 2016): 350
Phone: 100
Taxes owing: ~ 200
Save: ~250

That's basically bare minimum. He also owes me about $500, which I am in no hurry to get back. He NEEDS a better paying job, and we both know this. 

My budget, generally:

Rent: 600
car insur: ~90
gas: 200
food: 100
Student loan: 500 (I've got 27 000 left or so)
Parking: 60
407 charges: ~150
Misc: 100
Spending: ~ 300
Save: ~1700

I have two CCs, one with about 300 and the other with about 200 right now. They both have an interest rate of 19%. I just went on a vacation to visit family - it's almost paid off. I use them for phone bills and such, and almost never carry a balance.

So! I think I would have 30 000 saved in 2 - 3 years, myself. If my SO can contribute in the (hopefully near) future, I think its possible to have a downpayment in 2 years. I can deal with that, but I don't want to wait longer if I can help it. 

I have pretty good credit, last time I checked it was ~790. I have not spoken with a bank yet. 

So, should I keep saving, risk a house price increase that may happen in my area (It is beginning to - people from Toronto are investing in the real estate here) or go talk to a bank and get a loan to buy in 1 year. 

My budget isn't perfect, and I am working on improving it. I do also intend to find a better paying job (full time salaried position) in the future. Ideally I would leave my contractor status for 45 - 50 k /year. 

Thanks!",finance,1446222121
personalfinance,How can I take advantage of my job's monthly expense payments? (More details inside),"Quick background: When I turned 18 I signed up for a bunch of credit cards (5 total) with shitty interest rates and probably shitty points/benefits. Almost 10 years later, I am debt free (except student loans) and have pretty good credit. My job has the option to pay for certain expenses ourselves, and get reimbursed monthly. I’d like to take advantage of this by using my cards for points/benefits. 

My questions: How can I determine what bonus/benefits each card provides? Is it better to keep these cards with probably shitty benefits? How can I determine what better cards there are? Is it possible to “upgrade” my current cards to something with better benefits?

Thank you for any help and advice",finance,1446230289
personalfinance,How bad is ~$80k worth of student loans?,"Quick background:
- 19, second semester of CC, engsci ""major""(4.0 so far)
- have been working 40+ hours a week (min wage) for about a year and a half while going to school (missed a semester due to payment issues)
- single, am a relatively boring person (by choice I assure you), pretty scared of being broke so I have ""splurged"" maybe twice in my working life
- saved most of my early $$, pay my parents a ""monthly contribution"", and I also pay for most things that I need.
-building credit by using a secure card paid off every month
- want to major in aerospace engineering, parents won't pay for school BUT I dont qualify for aid.

My problem: didn't know what I was doing out of high school + no one to guide me (""college counselors"" told me to ask my parents how to do stuff) = didn't know how to take out loans for the 2 state schools I got into, and thought it would be too much money (17k/year after every possible merit scholarship). My mom didn't stop me from not going. I had no knowledge of the concept of ""investment"" back then, ended up not going either school because I was scared of loans. The only school open for enrollment past that deadline was a CC, which I figured I had to go to. I may have screwed my life over by not knowing what to do, which I highly regret. Trust me, you don't have to tell me that this was some terrible decision making, I know it was. I was a smart but lost kid in high school, so SAT was high and gpa was decent (3.74). Didn't know what I was doing, no one in my family has gone to college so no help there either.

Now, about 2 years later, I know what I want to do. And it is exactly what I set out to do in the first place. Except now I won't get any good scholarships because I'm not a first year student anymore, and transferring from CC is actually going to cost me more money than it was going to in the first place, despite ""saving"" money on CC credits.
So now instead of 17k a year, it's likely going to be 22k a year.
By sheer luck, despite my complete lack of planning for the future, the school I wanted to go to out of high school (the university of buffalo, NY) takes every single credit from my CC that I have taken. I can take 4 more classes that will transfer, then I will apply to buffalo and hope they accept me again.

If they do, and I end up graduating, I'm gonna end up about 80k in debt according to what I presume my costs will be. I analyzed the field a bit, most AS engineers make about 65-70k a year out of college.

Why this could work for me:
Like I said, I'm a frugal, boring guy. I do it because I can't keep up with both keeping myself alive and having fun with my current income. Kind of ended up that way. Therefore, I figured that if my net pay ends up being around 50k/year after taxes, I can live like a spartan for a few years and pay off my loans. I've learned to live pretty low maintenance so to speak. I will be living the way I want to be and doing what I want to be (engineering) so I think I'll be alright.

Why this may not work:
I think the maximum amount of loans I could get from the fed govt is like $6500 a year. I have no idea where to get the remaining $15,000 worth of loans from, the financial aid office redirects me everywhere and never has an answer for me. It is frustrating, I may not be able to even get the loans needed to attend school. My alternatives are limited due to my lack of planning. I live in NYC, where aerospace engineering doesn't exist outside of the Ivy League, private type schools. I would have to take something else that I won't like. I could just transfer to a commuter 4 year university and hope that I get the education that I want and hope that they take as many classes and UB does. The biggest problem is that I've read that student loans require a cosigner, and my mom may not be willing to cosign.

(Note: in no way do I blame my mother for any of this, nor do I hate her or have any issues with her. Her life was tough and I don't blame her for not guiding me better.)

Idk what to do guys, I'm not sure where else to turn but here. i figured I might ask because there was another thread similar to this yesterday. Someone mentioned advice about CC which was 100% true, and definitely would have applied to me if I had known it 2 years ago.

personalfinance,"27K CC debit, no end in sight. Considering Debt Conslidating, Debt Settlement, or selling rental house?","Hi guys, 
I posted in here a week ago and got some great feedback and am hoping to get some more.  I posted previously about budgeting and debt as a whole, but now I would like to tackle CC debt specifically.

I have about 27K in CC debt, with interest rates ranging as low as 9% and as high as 29.99%.   I know all about the snowball method and avalanche method, but honestly, we don't have any left over money to start making a dent in the balances.  We have just enough money each month to pay bills, pay minimum payments, and eat cheap, but that is it (already cut cable and don't miss it actually!)  We have been considering either debt conslidation, debt settlement, or selling our rental home next spring and using the potential 40-50K we might make to pay off some or all of our debt.   We do not have any plans to buy another house in the near future, as I don't think we could get a good mortgage for awhile (I am on disability thanks to cancer, my husband just got back into teaching, so less than 2 years at his current job, and lots of debt).  

Also, most of the cards are maxxed out, so we can't use them anymore, but I am also aware that whatever option we choose to try to get started on tackling debt, we MUST NOT use CC anymore!  I know we can apply for more, we get offers all the time, but we WILL NOT do that!  We cannot.  Just wanted to clarify that I understand it is easy to get back into debt, or further into it, and I will not let that happen, no matter what. 

So, our choices are as follows:
#1:  Sell rental house, use the potential 40-50K to pay some or all debt
#2 Debt settlement
#3 Debt conslidation 

Our goals are:
#1 Work towards getting out of debt, the sooner the better, but just getting a jump start is the main goal.
#2 Freeing up some money each month so we can breath a little more each month and hopefully throw most of that money at debt.  In about 6 months, we will have an extra $500 a month available because a car and my medical bills will finally be paid off, but that is still 6 months away. 

I feel like selling our home is probably the best way to go, but, that is all dependent on the house actually selling and us actually getting the price we will.  I got my real estate license and I am pretty confident that it will sell, but, I could be wrong.  Then we are stuck with either #2 or #3. 

I have read the pros and cons on both conslidation and settlement, but I can't decide which is best for us.  I don't know anyone who has dealt with these things before, as most of our friends and family are upper middle class and this topic never comes up.  Additionally, we are embarassed to ask about it.

Lastly, making more money is not an option at the moment. Although I'm technically NED, I'm still getting treatment and although I'm applying for jobs, no one is hiring me. Even if someone does give me an offer, I have to weigh it against the cost of childcare because we have a 2 year old I'm currently staying home with.  I do have my real estate license and I'm hoping that takes off soon, but, that can take years to build up clients.  My husband is a full time teacher and takes on as many EC activities as he can for extra pay.

Which do you think is the best option?   Do you have any experience with any of these?  Any recommendations?  Thank you in advance.  This is only my second reddit post, so I'm still getting used to reddiquette and formatting.

personalfinance,My mother recently admitted to nearly 50k worth of credit card debt.

This was during conversation about how excited I was to be paying off my 12k debt, my timelines and payment methods/budgeting. 

Anyway, my questions is what would happen to those debts if/when she passes away? She clearly has no intention of ever paying them off or debt plans, and scoffed when I suggested budgeting. 

I am 99% certain my father has no idea about the scope of her debt, and it's leaving me sick thinking about it. She has always refused to budget with him jointly. They have a mortgaged home, they probably owe around $150k on a property currently worth about $400k.

personalfinance,(23f) Stepping down from job position to go back to school. My credit is marked fraudulent. This is messy.,"Okay i have no idea where to start i have a million questions.

In January I'm stepping down at work from 28k/yr salary (excluding bonus) to 20k/yr hourly (no tips/bonus). I'm doing this so that I have time to go back to school. I'll drop from 52+ hours to 40 hours maximum.  I have a second option of switching job locations (within driving distance) getting a raise to 32k a year salary with no bonus, yet close to university. However I would be working 45+ hours a week. (I'm a little uncomfortable with this because i would like to be devoted to school).

Next: I'm fortunate enough to currently have minimal savings, moderate investments, and zero debts! I will be taking on debt from school (a zero interest loan from family).

Question #1
     Should i take job option one and live the ramen life and have ample time for school. Or take job option two have money but no time (and likely sleep very little/never see my fiance.. But still eat well, and hope sleep doesn't overpower my studies). 

Part 2:

Long story short had my credit run without my approval to find out it's marked fraudulent based on an event 2 years ago.

Event: Target data breach. I lose.

Problem that occured: Bankthatsucks refunded my money, sent me an affidavit to sign, then bankthatsucks lost my affidavit, no affidavit means no money refund, they withdrew the money back. I call them, repeat this scenario 4-5 times over 7 months. 

Obviously i was fed up with this money game. After them FINALLY letting me ""sign"" an affidavit over the phone with voice confirmation, i assumed the situation over. I withdrew my money and closed my account, never to return with my business. A few short weeks later bankthatsucks calls. They ""double credited"" my account and want their money back before they close it. I keep bankthatsucks teller on the phone while we go through statements from the last 7 months. Teller is convinced it was credited too many times, I was not. The credit they were referring to was the final instance of my money being reimbursed to me. I told bankthatsucks they were mistaken and that the credit was indeed accurate. They said no. I said look I've  been fighting over this money for 7 months, it has been settled. There are no errors. Stop trying to take my money. Teller said we would be in touch, and i haven't heard from them since.

Now my credit is marked fraudulent and I'm worried that if sometime in the next couple years i need a loan to make it by, i will be denied!

Thus Question #2
     Is there a way i can redeem my credit marking, or is it too late? I don't want to contact bankthatsucks unless absolutely necessary. What should i do about this?

Question #3 
     Should i be concerned that my credit was run without my approval? It was at a new car dealership (if that matters).

Question #4
     I'm excited yet very nervous for all the changes in my life, do you have any LPT's for mentally adjusting to these financial changes?

personalfinance,"New mom looking for advice on debt, school, etc. Avalanche or snowball?","My husband and I are planning to stay in the area that we live for less than five years. Our first baby was born 09/25 &lt;3 He's darling, btw. I am a respiratory therapist who quit in April (bad choice) due to severe morning sickness and just plain being fed up with pediatricians I worked with. I'm keeping current on my licenses/certifications. I am planning to go back to school come spring (part time) taking pre-reqs for a masters in accounting. To enter full time 09/2016 and graduate 08/2017. I'm considering going back to work part time at a different hospital in January.

My husband is a grad student who got a job at the university he was attending (he's a software engineer) and brings home $1,284 after taxes biweekly. He's been there since May. Part of his benefits (very valuable) is that he can take 2 classes each semester free of charge. Using this benefit he will graduate next August with his masters. This brings us to me going back to school. Another benefit of working for the university is that my tuition is 50% off. Undergrad credits (I believe I need 6 credits) are $529 each at normal price. So for me each 3 credit class will be just under $800 for class costs. Graduate credits are $861.50 per credit normal price. When I'm taking those, I'll be full time and can apply for a (additional) student loan. Which may be worth doing as soon as I can because it will certainly have lower interest rate than my credit cards/unsecured loans. My brother has helped us out with money here and there as we've had some unforeseen expenses. My father in law sold us a car and told us to pay him ""when we can""... I don't like owing them but neither do I know how to pay them back as quickly as I'd like. My FIL particularly I know would prefer we pay off our actual debt.


As far as baby expenses, I'm breastfeeding, insurance covered a breast pump, my mom has provided wonderful cloth diapers (she made them) and a friend gifted us 3 boxes of various sized disposables. My parents and family also gave us pretty much everything we need for baby (travel system, pack and play, swing, crib, rockers, clothes, blankets, shelving system (and installed it for me...) and the only thing I paid for was a cosleeper which I bought used.

So I'm thinking about my options to get this done. My girlfriend suggested Rise Credit, they gave her a pair of $1000 loans when she needed bailed out of a bad financial situation earlier this year. i'm wary because of the insane interest rates they're allowed to charge in Ohio, plus there's a CSO fee. So that's out of the question for that much but it might get me by for this month.

I tried LendingClub and LendingTree, neither of them will give me the money. The problem I'm seeing (and this was as issue when we got our apartment, too) is that I actually don't have a credit score because of this collections action. So the debt I owe is preventing me from getting a loan to pay it off. It's ridiculous.

Here's what I'm looking at, if anyone can help I'd appreciate it.

**Income**: $350-$450 p/w ($1400-1800 p/m) after taxes, before garnishment

**Expenses**
Rent: my share is $500 p/m

Car: $150 p/m, $1000 remaining owed

Tools (I'm a mechanic): $60 p/w, $600 remaining owed

Debt: 20% per week garnished, $8000 remaining owed

Food, gas, other misc: about $40 p/w

I know that based on the math, I should be doing alright, but this last garnishment came right at the end of the month when I was getting ready to pay rent. It's a matter of personal pride now, I want this debt done so I don't have some faceless lawyers four states away putting their hands in my pockets before the money even gets to me.

financialindependence,This math seem right? Pay down student loans vs invest,"I'm running numbers after reading the thread about what should you do financially now before the end of 2015. That got me to thinking about my 2016 financials, and longer term planning (as one is prone to do on a Friday night instead of hanging out with either of two different sets of friends). And I got to running some maths on two scenarios. Option A is I continue what I've been doing which is aggressively paying down student loans ($4500 since May, woohoo!) at the cost of only investing 401k money to get the employer match. Option B is the opposite where I max my 401k, and pay down student loans much less aggressively. Here are the numbers and scenarios:

**Numbers used for both scenarios**

* Yearly income - $75k (work matches 50% of 6%, but it's not vested until 5 years... I'll likely leave before then so company match is irrelevant), likely will break $100k in 5 years in worst case scenario

* Student loan balance - $29500 @ ~~6.8%~~ **5.73% weighted APR** , this does *not* include any tax benefits which I do get to deduct the interest on my taxes from them. 

* Roth - Maxed each year

* Current retirement accounts - $26000

* Desired FI years - 16

* Target - $600k (this is the minimum depending on variables such as do I own a house, where do I want to live, do I continue working, etc etc but could be closer to 800k-1m)

* Assuming no raise (unlikely, but easier to calculate)

* 7% RoI (not including inflation, even though I'm pretty aggressive in my limited portfolio I prefer to run these numbers a bit conservative due to the time horizon)

* **Extra money each month for this** - $1400 pretax (401k route) or $800 post tax (student loan route)


*So under Scenario A:*

* Put an additional $800/mo towards student loans has them paid off May 2018

* Put 6% in to 401k (while company match likely will be irrelevant, it's possible that I stay here that long under the right circumstances or they change the 401k policy as HR has been doing a lot to bring the company more to current large company policies)

* Once loans are paid, swing that to max investments and build taxable investments

* This nets to roughly $705k @ 16 years. Math = 14 years @ 18k with 7% rate ($480k) + 10 years of $800/mo from previous car/student loan minimum payments ($135k). The 10 year figure is used as I'll likely need another car prior to hitting FI. Roth would net another $90k. 

*Scenario B:*

* Put the $1400 pretax to 401k. 

* Student loans are paid off in Jan 2020 

* Once loans are paid off, swing the money going to them over to taxable investment accounts as noted in option A (just starting later)

* This nets to roughly $750k @ 16 years. Math = 16 years @ 18k with 7% rate ($590k) + 6 years of $800/mo from previous car/student loan minimum payments ($71k). Roth nets another $90k. 

**Summary:** So it looks to me like putting a lot of money to 401k is a (slightly) better option but only if I'm comfortable having the student loan debt for another 4 years. It also would mean I wouldn't hit my previously stated goal of student loans paid off @ 30 (which I'm cheating and saying before I turn 31... giving me 2 years instead of only 1). But if it's better financially to do this I'm okay with it. I'll likely pay off the one I've been working on killing the past few months just to have the ability to free up another $175/mo if I ran into problems. 

Does my math check out? Anybody have any comments, suggestions, or better ideas? 

**EDIT** - I know I could do a combination of the two, but that made the math more complicated than I cared to do tonight. But I might end up doing like 75% plan A and 25% plan B (as far as allocation amounts)

**EDIT 2** - First, thanks for the help all. Secondly I made a mistake on my interest rate. The weighted APR for the loans is 5.73%, not 6.8%. Also keep in mind I cannot pay down the loans held within each loan (i.e. on loan 1 I can't pay the unsubsidized first, they were automatically combined into a singular new loan). 

I misstated in the OP, my loans are at **5.73%** when I calculate the weighted interest rate:

**Loan 1** (this is the one I've been targeting this year) - $5869.71 @ 6.16% - $120.66/mo (until 2017, when it goes up to $145)

* Subsidized 1: 3312.25 @ 5.75%

* Unsubsidized 1: $2538.90 @ 6.55%


**Loan 2** - $11,657.84 @ 5.19% - $125.05/mo (until 2017, then goes up to $151.07)

* Subsidized 2.1 - $3,873.46 @ 4.25%

* Unsubsidized 2.1 - $3,750.98 @ 6.55%

* Subsidized 2.2 - $1,957.35 @ 6.55%

* Unsubsidized 2.2 - $2,044.66 @ 3.15%

**Loan 3** - $12,064.43 @ 6.08% - $137.22/mo (until 2017, then goes up to $165/mo)

* Subsidized 3 - $4,744.29 @ 5.35%

* Unsubsidized 3 - $7,282.10 @ 6.55%",finance,1446260579
oil,How do you guys feel about the US rate hike playing into Oil and Gas?,"Personally, I feel that the Saudis timed their flooding of the market to do as much damage as possible to the shale industry (no surprise there).  However I think they intentionally chose and planned the time to flood the market specifically a few months before the US raises the Federal Interest rate.  As we all know, the majors and super majors are hemorrhaging money (generally speaking), and I've got to believe that most non-integrated, smaller to midsize companies have one foot in the grave financially.  

I think that once the US touches that interest rate, the Bakken and other shale fields will go more or less belly up, with huge amounts of consolidation to companies that have been weathering the storm (so far). 

Once the US raises the interest rate, two things will happen.  
#1) Price of oil crashes again.  As the US dollar grows in the strength, oil price will drop to reflect that.  This effect will most likely be enhanced in magnitude by speculators. 
#2) Interest rate's rise, causing banks to call their loans even harder, and companies who are barely staying afloat now, will be going belly up.  Larger companies who are able to finance their projects internally, or through stock may not be affected in this regard as smaller companies who are overleveraged as it is.

As a result of this, the Bakken and other shale oil fields, already on their knees from the market flooding crash and burn and after undergoing mass consolidation, never again return to their previous levels of production.

Obviously I make a bunch of assumptions throughout this post, what do you guys think of this hypothesis?",energy,1446268810

personalfinance,Looking for financial help/advice with taking on loans for graduate school as an American studying in Australia,"Hi /r/personalfinance , I am going out on a limb here for some advice. I'll describe my situation at hand. I am trying to go to graduate school in Australia in February. I have graduated from school in the states and I have already been accepted to a program in Sydney. This means everything to me being able to go to Sydney. I studied there for a semester a couple years back and in my mind I need to return. There are a lot of reasons as to why I need to do this, a lot of personal reasons I won't get into, but for the past three years everyday since I was last there it has been a goal of mine to go back.

&amp;nbsp;

After being accepted to a program I was so excited and I even received a scholarship from the school (granted I can't receive the schoalarship if I dont accept my offer). However no one in my family supports my decision and I am completely on my own in this matter. They do not want to support me financially which I totally understand, but they are actively condemning me from trying to achieve something I have set my mind on for so long. I have some loan debt from college around 20,000$ but if i go to school its going to get deferred until after i complete school. The cost of school is around $50,000 for a year (program is a year and a half), this includes tuition and cost of attendance with things such as rent, food, basic living necessities.

&amp;nbsp;

I talked to the financial office at the school and they said I most likely can be covered under a federal unsub direct loan and the rest can be covered under a federal direct plus loan. I completed my FAFSA and am waiting to hear from the school after I submitted the report to them. My parents are constantly saying how I will be broke for ever trying to repay these loans, and although I know little to nothing about finance I really think it can't be so black and white. I have around $8,500 saved up but I am currently unemployed (graduated from school in May this year) as I am trying to figure things out. 

&amp;nbsp;

I really dont know if this is the right place to post this, I am really all alone in this and I am trying to reach out to a community that can point me in the right direction. Even if someone says i should find employment and save up rather than taking on loans is help enough. This really means a lot to me, it actually means everything in the world to me, and if I were to postpone this for another year or so it would absolutely devastate me as I have already put so much time and effort into figuring this all out.

&amp;nbsp;

I appreciate any sort of feedback, thank you for hearing me out. I can provide more info if its needed, but didnt want to create any more of a large work of text here.

personalfinance,Wife wants to mortgage house to pay off student loans and invest in stock market...good idea?,"Hi PF. I got married recently to a wonderful woman and she knows I have federal student loans (~120k) majority being at 7% interest--graduate school loans. She owns a house free and clear which her family helped her with prior to us getting married. Our combined gross income is about 75k a year and she thinks making monthly payments on the student loans is expensive due to the high interest and wants to pay it off in one go. Of course we don't have that kind of money, she thinks that if we mortgaged the house (valued at around 300k) we could use those funds to pay off the student loans and use the remainder to invest in the stock market. I'm not sure if that's even allowed or a good idea. She says that it's better to pay a 300k debt off at 3-4% over time instead of the student debt (40k @ 3% and 80k @ 7%). She also thinks that the money earned on the stock market from the 180k investment we could get a return greater than the mortgage we take out at 3-4% which would help pay it off sooner.

I'm not that familiar with finance or investing, but I feel that there are some assumptions baked into her reasoning that won't make this work. But hey I'm the dummy with 120k in student loans so I turn to you PF, you're my only hope. Is her idea feasible?",finance,1446311222

politics,Ted Cruz's Tax Plan Is Really Dangerous,"Ted Cruz unveiled his tax plan this past week and, like Rand, is going the way of the simple flat tax.  Many news outlets are reporting on the details and using the [Tax Foundation analysis](http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-senator-ted-cruz-s-tax-plan) as the basis for discussion.  It's also important to understand that Cruz's Business Transaction Tax is a Value Added Tax (VAT) of a particular variety; tax is calculated as business revenue minus expenses to other businesses.  This is called the subtraction-method and is one of several methods to calculate VAT's.  The Tax Foundation gives a [good primer on the topic](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/ted-cruz-s-business-flat-tax-primer) and on Cruz's plan in general.  

However, as positive a spin as some outlets are giving Cruz's plan, it is incredibly dangerous- more so than any other plan I've seen thus far.  Not only is the flat tax regressive in nature, but the subtraction-method VAT is probably the worst VAT a nation can implement.  The first red flag in this plan is that no other nation on Earth has implemented this type of VAT.  Japan tried in 1989 and then switched to a hybrid method- see [Tamaoka's paper from 1994](http://www.ifs.org.uk/fs/articles/tamaoka_may94.pdf).  Cruz's plan forgoes the experiential learning from Japan.  But this isn't the worst part.  

The worst part is the lack of accountability.  Using a pure subtraction-method instead of credit-invoice, the danger posed by inversions and foreign subsidiaries grows exponentially.  When [Google and other companies sell intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary and then license it back to lower their tax burden](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes) you see right away the problem this method creates.  Not only is the risk of abuse through international shenanigans probable, but domestic abuse through sole proprietorship passthroughs becomes an even bigger problem.  This is partially why no subtraction-method VAT has ever existed in the form Cruz proposes: it just won't work.  

Other things to consider are that this VAT won't allow deductions for wages.  Current corporate taxes allow businesses to count wages as business expenses, so raising wages can lead to a lesser tax burden.  Cruz's plan won't allow that, removing an incentive to raise wages in a time when wage stagnation is a problem.  The plan may also face WTO issues with regards to the [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade) and the [Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures](https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/24-scm.pdf) because of the subtraction-method's favorability towards origin-based accounting- that is to say, deducting taxes for foreign purchases when the foreign company does not offset that deduction.  Fairness gets lost which is a big no-no in the WTO and why things like the Dispute Settlement Body and ISDS exist.  

On top of this, know that the [Government Accountability Office (GAO) looked into the subtraction-method VAT back in 1989](http://archive.gao.gov/d25t7/138940.pdf)- the same year Japan tried it out.  They raise concerns like I brought up above and talk extensively about the regressivity of the plan.  To combat it, they offer a hybrid solution for credit-invoice and discuss the need for multiple tax rates as well.  But the multiple rate solution introduces complexity and overhead.  Cruz's plan will not allow it.  His dismantling of the IRS will not allow it.  The IRS would be needed to handle the complexity involved.  In essence, they'd recommend a credit-invoice VAT to combat the regressive nature and complex rules required to handle all circumstances.  

I could be wrong about this and would welcome any feedback as such.  But at the end of the day, we need people educated as to why Cruz's plan is as bad as it is.  No offsetting through the Universal Savings Account (a good idea) or higher deduction for individuals will make this plan one the United States should consider as it has been laid out.  It's really dangerous and does nothing to solve the underlying economic problems are nation is working through IMO.

personalfinance,Question and suggested strategies for taxes on side hustle gigs.,"Wondering if anyone could give me some advice on this.

I'm currently a high income individual (firmly in the 28% tax bracket).  I do some small side gigs (think AirBnb, dogsitting, etc) that will net me around $3,000 in additional income.

If I'm understanding this right, my taxes on this side income will be hefty.  With federal income tax, state income tax, and FICA taxes, it looks like it will be somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% in taxes on that 3k.

One option I've been thinking I could do is to up my 401k contributions by an extra $1,500 a month for the next two months (November and December).  By doing this, I could save on the hefty tax bill by essentially reducing my taxable income by $3,000.

I'm saving 10% of my income into the 401k at the moment because I've been putting a large amount of my income into my student loans (I've been paying $2500 a month into my student loans, and have a remaining balance of around $17,500 at a 1.94% variable interest rate).

Naturally, if I up my 401k contribution by $1500 a month, I'd need to reduce my student loan payments down to $1000 a month.

I'm thinking it might make sense to take that path in order to reduce my taxable income on this side gig money.  Just wondering if I could get some opinions on this.  Should I stay the course and simply suck it up and pay the taxes on the side gig income?  Or should I consider ramping up my 401k contributions significantly for these next two months in order to reduce my taxable income, and simply pay less on my loans for those two months?

(As a note, my 401k won't be maxed out this year even with the increased contributions).",finance,1446315258
personalfinance,His and Hers Student Loans,"I'm kind of curious how other couples handle this situation.  My husband and I both have fairly large graduate student loans.  $50,000 for him and $110,000 for me.  We both have them on extended repayment now and each loan is in our own name.  Thankfully we both have good income and now that we've married and have combined households, we are striving to become debt free.  We paid off his credit card this year.  Our plan is to pay off his car loan and then refinance his student loan with a private lender at a lower interest rate for a 5 year term. Then after his is paid off we plan on refinancing mine.  My only concern is I've been through a divorce before and I'm worried that if we did divorce in the future, we've paid off all the debts in his name while only paying the minimum on the debt in my name.  We are happy now of course and I'm not expecting we will divorce, but things happen.  I guess if the worst happens, I'm pretty frugal and would just get on with it and focus on paying off my debt.  We could refinance both for longer terms, but we can get a better rate for a shorter term loan and I like the security of one of us gets laid off that we could put my loan in forbearance if required.

personalfinance,How's my plan to save for a down-payment on a house?,"My wife and I will soon finish paying off all our credit card debt!  It hit $15,000 at one point, so obviously we’re excited be free from that terrible burden.  

But we’ve focused on debt for so long that we don’t know what to do next.  We know we want to save money for a down-payment on a house.   We’ve cut back spending as far as we can stand at the moment, so we’re fine in terms of budgeting (for example, we live in the cheapest apartment we could find).  What we don’t know is where put the extra $1,200/month we’ll have very soon.  

Here are our finances:

* Housing: We want to buy a $200,000 home, and have no savings at the moment.
* Retirement: We have $6,000 we put into two Vanguard traditional IRAs in 2014.  We also contribute 7% of our pre-tax income to two pensions, and we don’t plan to leave the public sector anytime soon.  
* Student loans: We still have about $25,000 in student debt between us, and we pay $500 per month which is $50 more than the minimum payments.

Here’s our tentative plan: We’ve heard we can withdrawal the amount we’ve contributed to a Roth IRA to use as a down-payment on a house.  Therefore, we should convert our $6,000 in traditional IRA into a Roth IRA immediately.  We could pay $1,100 per month for five months until we hit the $5,500 monthly limit.  For the next seven months, we’d deposit the funds into a savings account (with Ally Bank I guess?) 
Also, I’m refinancing my federal student loans into the private sector to drop my interest from 6.6% to 4.6%. But since that rate could jump in the next few years, we’d pay $100 more on our student loans and pay them off ASAP.

**Is our plan reasonable?  How could we make it better?**

edit: Forgot to mention we'd probably be looking at saving 10% of the home cost as a downpayment.  We'd love to get to 20%, but we'd rather start a family in a house than an apartment building with thin walls, and we want to start a family in the next year or two.

gaming,I've made a huge gaming mistake..,"Background: I'm married with kids (not the mistake)

Story: I was so excited for Super Mario Maker I made a horrible deal with the wife. Firstly, I didn't own a Wii-u so I had to aquire that along with the game. The wife told me I could aquire said console and game if I don't buy another ge until we finish remodeling our home by redoing all the floors and replacing all the doors. Well, she and I both knew that was probably 2 years. The smart guy I am I told her I'd make the deal bit I also get 1 extra game of my choice during that period. I thought I was getting the better deal here..... 

That was until I ended up using my extra game to get Yoshi Wooly World. I got it in hopes that we both could play a game together. And I figured my 1 extra game would totally be worth playing a game with the wife. Boy was I mistaken.

She loved the game but only played it for a couple days until she just didn't want to play it anymore. Great.. so I decided to beat the game by myself and it was fun.

Now here comes the part where I knew I made the mistake (yes, a month later). I started seeing more trailers for games I would like to play. I have an Xbox One and a beefed up PC as well but recently I've been more interested in playing on Xbox because I like not having to sit at my desk all the time to play. 

I'm sadly going to be missing out on games for the next 2 years. Super sad because Fallout 4 (swoon), Wii-U Zelda (moan), Tom Clancy The Division, Quantumbreak, Crackdown 3. That's just for now. So many more games in the future.

Don't feel sorry for me. I'm obviously the idiot here. And the lesson is no matter your love for having 1 game don't give up on the possibilities of future games by making a deal that will ruin you.",technology,1446324457
personalfinance,"Federal student loan handler (mohela) charges me the same income contingent amount each month, but varies the ratio of principal to interest. How does this effect my debt?",[deleted],finance,1446329170
personalfinance,Seeking advice on saving for home buying with high student loans,"So, my wife and I make pretty good combined income, but I have about $185,000 in federal student loans at 6.8% from professional school. I've been trying to pay down the student loans aggressively due to the high interest rate, however my wife and I will be looking to buy a house next spring. We just had a baby and it's time to get a place of our own. We have enough saved for a 10% down payment. It could be possible to get to 20% if I really laxed on student loan payments for the next 6 months, but I hate to do that. I also hate the concept of having to pay for private mortgage insurance for the house. What do you guys think?

Edit: combined income of roughly 200k not including possible bonuses. Let's pretend we wanted a $350k house (we'd look in the 250-350 range). I'm paid ahead in my loans until May so theoretically I could make 0 in payments the next 6 months in order to try to get to 20% down payment. FWIW we live in the Midwest.",finance,1446330726
