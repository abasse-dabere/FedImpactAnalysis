personalfinance,What can I do now to help with my medical school student loans later?,"I'm 21 years old doing a Master's program right now and will be going into medical school a year after completion of the program. With this Master's program, I've already racked up a notable amount of student debt (~50k) and with the medical school tuition coming up soon, I am feeling very shaky and nervous in regards to my finances. I am the type of the person that hates any type of debt and will avoid accumulating debt as much as I can before finally giving in. (Thus, I don't have any undergrad debt.)


&amp;nbsp;


This medical school costs ~32k per year for tuition so that's going to be at least ~128k for the whole 4 years, provided they don't change the tuition rate next year. I am working part-time right now, earning $16/hour pre-tax and work very minimally this semester due to the high intensity program, so my hours change depending on how busy I am each week. I pay for my car, my rent, and my living expenses (and tuition but that's from my loans). 


&amp;nbsp;



Here's what everything boils down to:


&amp;nbsp;



My current money/income:


* ~$1k left in savings (due to my cut down of hours these past weeks, I've had to take money out of my savings to pay for rent.)


* $700 in bank


* $400-700 of income biweekly (predicted to increase next semester to $800-1000)


* $3k from loans coming in January for next semester


&amp;nbsp;


My spending:


* $600/mo for rent


* $234/mo for car (this was originally purchased by my dad, and he promised to pay for it all but he's in a LOT of debt, so I've been paying to avoid burdening him. The car will be fully paid off in 2 years.) 


* $100/mo for living expenses (gas, food, Netflix--shared with my family)


&amp;nbsp;


Total Loans: ~50k for Masters + ~128k for MD = ~178k total (hopefully?)


Interest rate: 6.3%


&amp;nbsp;


Just to help me calm down, I would really like to know what steps I should do to help with my loans later? The interest rate is really turning me off at 6.3% and I'm not sure what's the best option to pay them off later and when I should start paying them. How do I pay and how do I (reasonably) avoid the most interest accumulated? Approximately how long will it take for me to finish paying off the debt? I will mostly likely be getting underpaid horribly during residency program so not sure how much that's going to help with my loans...

personalfinance,Should I pay my student loan ASAP or just wait pay in 20 years? (CL),"Even though my question is about a Chilean student loan, anyone should be able to help me on this matter.


A few years ago I applied to a state backed student loan, handled by private banks (""Credito con aval del estado"") to pay my undergrad. As most of the long terms loans here, it was in UFs (nominal currency adjusted by the inflation) at a 6% interest rate, paid with monthly fixed payments for 20 years, starting 1 year after I graduate. I was not poor enough to apply to scholarships or better loans, and this one had way better rates than 100% private loans, so I just took it. 


1 or 2 years later, the government reduced the interest rate to 2% retroactively, but for the older loans the change would be effective on the monthly payment. This mean that my loan is still increasing at CPI + 6% yearly, but the payments are calculated as if it was at CPI+2% since the beginning. Because of this, if I pay the whole loan now, I wouldn’t benefit for the interest rate reduction.  


By now, I owe around 700 UF (~US$25k) and I’m due to start paying next January. I have enough savings to pay for almost half of it and then do smaller payments every 2-3 months (there’s a minimum of 10% of the debt). 

Also:


* The loan has the possibility to limit the payments to a 10% of the monthly income (the difference is subsidized by the state). But my income is really close to the 10% I would pay, and I expect it to double in 2-3 years, so this would only benefit me for the first year.


* We have an ongoing student conflict that started demanding free education a few years ago, so there’s a remote possibility of another reduction of the interest rate or something similar. I hardly believe something would benefit me, since I have a good income compared to the rest of the country.


So my dilemma is, with those interest rates, is it better to pay it ASAP at a 6%, or stick with the 2% for another 20 years and hope something happens in between?. Any advice would be helpful.",finance,1446352068

Bitcoin,A Tautology: Coins will end up in the hands of long-term holders,"By definition that is what will happen but I think this effect is more significant that it initially appears. When there is a finite amount of something, that supply will potentially dry up. For some time now the amount mined has been absolutely dwarfed by volumes. So the supply might be coming from long-term holders but that source can't last forever.

My basic point is and has been for a long time that some percentage of the total volume is disappearing essentially into the hands of people who want to hang onto them and the total volume is so large that a modest percentage will cause the supply to dry up very fast. We have seen days where the dollar volume is close to or even exceeded 1 billion which is about a quarter of the total number of existing BTC. If 10% of those went into the hands of long-term holders than in only a month or so there would be no BTC available.",cryptocurrency,1446360986
personalfinance,"College student looking to use my savings to invest in a more reliable car, are there any tips for someone new to the system?","Hello PF,

I am in my third year of college and I have been saving money from multiple sources (jobs, birthdays, holidays), and I am at the point where my current automobile is seeing its last months. I have slightly over $16k saved and was considering a car with much more reliability with opportunities such as internships becoming possibilities. My current plan is to start with a $3-4k down payment and ~$166 monthly payments for 48 months on whichever car has the best fit and costs around $10k total with a safe estimate of $1k of trade in value from my previous car, so I can offset monthly payments with the money earned from my jobs. As far as the monthly payment quote, that number was taken from the auto dealership's website that I intend to purchase the car from, but there can be wiggle room with the monthly payments. The checking account I currently use has a .35% APR, but requires a balance that is consistently greater than $5k, which is why I would prefer an initial down payment that is enough to reduce monthly payments to the point where my earnings during school (~$180 per two weeks) would keep my account stable. In addition, I am also making monthly rent payments since I am living in an apartment until August (8 more payments of $770, totaling $6,160). Assuming the rent payments were to come out of my account the instant that I made a down payment on a car, which is a worst case scenario that would not happen, my account would still be over $1k past my account's $5k limit.

I apologize for the lengthy bit of reading, to the actual question now. Is there anything to know about the process of purchasing a car when making such a significant investment? Although I am handling student loans that will come into effect after graduation, the applied concepts of interest rates and other factors that affect overall prices is something that I am relatively new to. 

Any input is greatly appreciated, thank you for taking the time to help me make the right choice!",finance,1446361031
personalfinance,"I'm 21. How am I doing, what can I do better?","Recently started a new job which earns ~30k base salary with approximately 7-8 hours of OT per week (which translates into roughly 8k/year in income) and annual bonus of ~10% of base salary. This translates into roughly 40k or so per year. I have not included the bonus in my budget, I plan to use it to pay off debts in full.

Debt:  
1. ~15k auto loan, with a 5.25% interest rate.  
2. ~5k student loans (federal), 6.55% interest rate.
(I contribute 2.5x minimum for my student loans currently and the minimum for auto loan)

Things I have done:  
1. Have $1500 saved in an emergency fund account, and I am contributing 20% of my income to it until I reach 4-6 months of fixed expenses.  
2. Contributing 6% (max before tax that my company will match) to my 401(k).  
3. Started Roth IRA account, of which I am currently contributing $50 a month (not much, but wanted to start it).  
4. Paid off credit card debt.  
5. Have term life insurance policy.

Things I need to consider:  
1. What loans to pay off, and how fast I should pay them off?  
2. How do I increase my rent/food expenses without breaking the budget (still living with parents, hope to leave in a year)?  
3. How should I finish my degree  (or should I?) without getting more debt, while working full time?

Total current monthly expenses including loans: $2669

Total current monthly expenses without student loans: $2027

We typically do a weekend trip once a month, eat out at restaurants occasionally, purchase non-required things, etc, which we are now trying to minimize.  

Currently, I am not certain how exactly I will be going to law school.  I may be quitting my job and going full time, I may work full time and go to school part time, I may try to continue working part-time if they allow me to while going to school full time.  

I may also quit, go full time, and start online tutoring to make some money while in law school.  I have college degrees in mathematics and nuclear engineering, which I believe would help me get an online tutoring job without too much difficulty.  

I also may go to law school in my current city, or go to a better law school outside my city, which would require me to pay for additional housing.  Either way, my wife will continue working and living in my current city.  I think I have a decent shot at full scholarships to the local schools, and a good shot for partial scholarships at distant, better schools.

Overall, there is a great amount of uncertainty in how my finances will be.  To add to it, my wife and I will likely have a child at some point while I am in law school.  Therefore, I am trying to gauge what is the best approach as we prepare for law school.

As can be seen by the above information, we can get by on just my wife's income if I quit, especially once all of the student loans are paid off, which could easily occur before I start law school.

Right now, the main priority is to have the credit card paid off before January 1st.  After that, I am uncertain. 

One idea was to just start saving as much as possible.  However, in terms of need based financial aid, it seems law schools will assume any amount of savings you currently have will go towards the payment of tuition.  So the more I save, the less financial aid I may be offered.  Therefore, since we could build back up our savings within three months, would it be better to greatly reduce our savings, and just throw it all towards our debts, at least until I get through all of the financial aid package aspects of law school?

Since my student loans are subsidized, should I just pay the minimum on them and let them go into deferment while I am in law school so that we can concentrate on our other debts?  It seems financially, it may be better to pay off a car to reduce the monthly required payments than to have my student loans paid off, despite the car having a lower interest rate.

Should I cash in all of the mutual funds? 

Would using some of my 401k if necessary to pay for law school be a bad idea?  My understanding is that I can withdraw from my 401k for schooling without paying the early withdraw penalty, although I would have to pay income tax.

Should we maximize our 401k contributions, which would still allow us to be saving money, but making the savings unavailable to be taken into account for need based financial aid consideration?

Is there anything else I should be considering?",finance,1446390337

I owe $3,000 on this truck but it is a 2007 and has about 160,000 miles on it. The truck runs great and I would love to pay it off. Not having a $300 truck payment each month would be great and if I ever fall on hard times and can't make money I would at least have my truck to get me to work or to find work.


I know I should pay of the CC which has a higher interest rate. I'm so close to paying off this truck though but not sure if it's worth it. Maybe I should be looking at trading in this truck for something cheaper/more fuel efficient?

Currently I am working in the oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico. As everyone knows prices are really cheap, great for economy but not so good for us oilfield workers. There has been a lot of downsizing in the beginning of this year and there could be more next year. The number of offshore rigs has decreased considerably. So I been debating a lot for months about what I should do with my money. Save or pay off loans?




* Annual Salary: $60,000 - 80,000
* Savings (Emergency Fund): $20,200 
* Car Loan: $12,823 at 4.5% interest rate, min pay $390
* Student Loan: $4,700 at 5.0% interest rate, min pay $66
* Credit Card: $2,200 at 0% interest rate till 2018, min pay $39 (interest goes to 19% after January 2018)




Monthly bills add up to $2,000. 
For the bills I cut out everything that wasn't needed. 
Necessities (groceries,gas,toiletries,pets,etc) on average is $500-700.
I also have medical and 401k coming out pretax. 




After all this I usually have about $300 - 700 left. Up until August I was putting it towards paying my second car and I finally paid it off (I don't have this car anymore, car crash). My plan was to then use that money to pay off my other car.




I keep hearing from people that the oilfield will not pick up till 2018. Add that with more and more companies slowing down with drilling and I'm not sure what to do. Should I use my spare money towards further increasing my emergency fund? Or Use it towards paying off my loans? 




I'm really worried that I might lose my job and the amount of time it would take to find another. I have an engineering degree so I should be okay but I also have to worry about my wife. She's going to school right now for a few more years. I wouldn't stress so much if I could move elsewhere but I really don't want to do that to my wife. She's put a lot of time into school and transferring is always such a headache. But the positive side is that tuition is incredibly cheap so we wouldn't want to move since that would mean an increase in tuition for her.




I keep going back and forth between saving and paying off the loans. It's starting to stress me out pretty bad. I keep thinking about how amazing it would be to pay off my car loan or my student loan sooner. But then I think what if I get laid off and only have 5-8 months of emergency fund. I would have to look for another job in a state that currently is not hiring for my field. I can't move because of school. I honestly would not mind working retail/restaurants but not sure if I could afford all the bills. 

My wife doesn't work and I will not let her because I want her to focus on keeping her high GPA. She tried working part time but it affected her GPA. School is paid by loans she took out. During the summer she gets internships that pay minimum wage, so that will help a little. 


I have all these scenarios running in my head and I'm just looking for what other people would do in my situation, unbiased opinions.

I have the following monthly expenses:

phone- $30

Own my car outright: (140k miles- have some worry about car as I mentioned long commute)

401k- $300 (became FTE September 1), employer is moving to new plan Jan 1 where I have the option to match up to 6% (3% automatically given), which will lower monthly income a little. 

I have $19,197 of federal loans left to pay back broken down like so:

Direct Subsidized        $3,500.00 3.400%
Direct Unsubsidized     $2,000.00 6.800%

Direct Unsubsidized     $3,682.00 4.660%

Loan payment: $199, starting 11/8

However, my loan provider (great lakes) treats all the loans as one lump sum, I have not seen a way to pay the higher interest loans separately/first (maybe they do that automatically?).

Obviously, I would like to see myself out of debt as soon as possible, it is always on my mind. However, I know that this might not be the best return on my money. 

So my real question is: with ~$1,500/month of income left, how much should I put toward loans, how much should I put toward other investments (heavily considering vanguard roth IRA), and how much should I save for the future?

I Think the easiest way for me to communicate my personal Finance plan is to just run you through what happens when I receive my bi weekly check. Ill use actual figures so its not hypothetical


So this past Wednesday 10/25.2015 I received a check for $2,375

-I Put 20% ($475.00) into my checking account for my {Flexible Spending}


-I put 40% ($950.00) into my Betterment investment account that I use as a slow growing savings account. I use Betterment for a few reasons. I don't have the time to watch over a personal vanguard account and I really don't mind the .2% that they take out. also since The SEC imposed new federal regulations on banks and investment houses they are really only allowed to make the similar investments to Betterment anyways so i'm going with cheaper option. I like betterment because their SIPC insured and because I see a very steady growth in the portfolio every month. I have a current Allocation of 85% stocks and 15% bonds. That being said I do not use my Banks savings account for actual savings and choose to use betterment instead because quite frankly compounding interest just doesn't do it for me. as well as for the next reason listed below. 



-I put 40% ($950.00) into my savings account. a few key things I do with this account

1. everything in this account is connected to my American Express Credit Card (primarily so i can gain better credit more quickly)

2. 20% of it is my fixed costs (monthly bills) that are all set for auto-pay so I dont have to worry about it. I also know exactly what day each bill takes place on and plan accordingly. 

3. the other 20% is actually used as a part of my {Flexible Spending}. I have it allocated like this so I gain better credit through daily purchases and I can only Spend the predetermined amount that I have allowed myself so I can go without accruing any interest and ultimately avoiding life ruining credit card debt. 


Also  I keep track of EVERY purchase that I make down to the cent with the MonefyPro App. this allows me to know exactly how much I have in each account and also it allows me to see the exact percentage of my different expenditure categories like eating out, groceries, gas, etc.....



that's pretty much it. within the next month a I receive full benefits from the company that I work for and will start a 401K which they match up to 4%. 


Like I said, let me know if there is anything different or something else you see that I should be doing in order to improve. all opinions will be really appreciated.",finance,1446396812
investing,Risks To The Micron Long Thesis,"I have just sold all my RAD holdings. If the buyout goes through I could have gotten a higher price, but that would take a while. I don't see any rival white knights on the horizon to compete for RAD and force the buyout price higher. CVS would probably not be approved by regulators. The same applies to acquirers based overseas. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and other superstores might hesitate to buy a company with this much debt unless they were very familiar with integration of the business. Walgreens was always the logical choice for a merger, but after they bought Boots I had thought they would be too highly leveraged to consider further acquisitions soon.

If the buyout does not go through, I would expect RAD's stock price to fall, recovering next quarter if profitability increases due to growth of the EnvisionRx portion -- assuming that growth materializes.

I may trade around the current RAD price level, because I think it is not far from a floor at this point, although if the Fed raises interest rates in December the floor might be lower. RAD has been a good stock for trading for quite a while, and that is likely to continue as long as a fixed price buyout remains unresolved.",finance,1446398485

**1. What do you guys think?**",finance,1446402776
personalfinance,"I can't afford tuition. I don't want to drop out of school. Should I take out a private loan? If so, which one?","I know private loans are terrifying. However, I need to finish school, and I don't have money for tuition. I applied for financial aid and was only awarded the federal loan (which covers not even half of my tuition). I took the loan, because I plan on teaching for the public school system, so it should be forgiven.

I'm at my wits end. I have no way of paying my tuition. I need to finish school. I'm currently working at an office job (not full time), but I am supporting myself, and have barely enough money to do that. I eat beans for dinner. I don't know what else to do.

If I *do* take out a private loan, which one should I take? I don't know the first thing about private loans. I don't have good credit, so my sister would cosign for me. 

On an unrelated note, anybody have any info about selling panties? Kiddingnotkidding.",finance,1446404495
personalfinance,First-time home buyers: to go big or not to go big?,"We're considering buying a house. We are having a hard time making some decisions. I'm not sure who to ask for advice. 

To fully grasp the situation, I need to tell you some financial details. All totaled, we have about 75K we can leverage for a house. We make about 8K combined each month. We're thinking about having a baby soon. Daycare is about 18K. Let's just say that it is about 1.5K/month for a baby.

The median house price in our area for a 3 bedroom 1 bathroom is around 600K. Just outside our area is not much better. Much further out would put us in the 350K-400K.

The reason for the increase in median home price is because a major company is moving to here and bringing several thousand in high-income jobs. So that has put immense pressure on the market. Consequently, houses in our ideal range (300-400K) are usually bought in a single day all in cash, waiving inspection and appraisal. Whatever we buy we will probably only put 10% down. Another variable is the interest rate, but even a 0.5% increase would only mean a $100 a month.

Given these variables, my gut tells me that buying something outside our area is better idea for a few reasons. Even people at the major company don't make enough to buy 600K houses. I have friends that work there. That means that there is more pressure on the bottom of the market. So I'd expect that houses on low end are more likely to see larger % increases. We would have enough expendable income to afford daycare, and a nice lifestyle. 

The downside is that the schools aren't as good. It might mean a substantial commute times. It’s important to me to keep that in mind. I don't want to do substantial driving with a baby in the car. And because I do most of the cooking, I'd like to be less than 20min away to be able to make dinner each night. A 600K house in our area would be about 1.3K more than our rent each month. Plus the cost of a baby, we are looking at a total of 2K in additional costs each month for an expensive house. So I think we could do it, but we wouldn't be saving anything and we'd have no expendable income.

Alternatively, we could just wait. Right now we are saving about 2K a month. Our rent is 1.7K. If we did wait, then let's say we had 9 months to find a house. During that time, we’d be able to save about 20K, maybe more if we get promotions or bonuses. Certainly, no more than 30K. That would mean about 100K to 110K in leverage-able funds, and maybe 9K to 10K in monthly revenue. Certainly, our upper limits would be 12K in monthly revenue. That changes the equation a bit.

So my question is really: What should we do? Buy a house that is a financial stretch to get in the right location. Or buy a house that we can afford, but maybe locks us out of the market where we want to live.

In our position, what would you do?",finance,1446406258
personalfinance,Feel financially stuck... IRA/Homebuying Questions,"I am a 31 year old federal scientist currently living in Monterey, CA, and I am looking for a little bit of financial guidance.   I'm mainly curious about starting an IRA and how this will impact my ability to buy a home down the line.  

I presently make around 105k (salary+differential), and this will likely steadily increase by 3-4%/year as long as I live here.  I max out my 401k, and get 4% matching, however I couldn't afford to do this until this last year, and I only have 55k in my 401k.  I've been trading in Scottstrade the last few years and generally did alright, however I took some severe hits in the last year and lost 30-40% of what I had in there.  I've since redistributed my non-401k investments between scotttrade, acorns, wealthfront, robinhood, and lending club.  Combined, these are worth about 25k.  Finally, I have about 5k in cash, and zero debt.  Giving me a grand total of around 80k between all my cash assets.   I currently send 125$/week to wealthfront and 25$/week to lending club, bringing my grand total invested per month to 2440$ (1840$ pre-tax incl matching, 600$ post-tax).

I've wanted to own my place for a while, but I've never felt like I was in the position to.  Rent here is very high (I pay 1800$/mo for a small 1 bedroom) and eats up nearly half of my take home income. Owning is currently out of the question as the cheapest 'acceptable' dwellings are 500k, however  I have seen a few 'condos' as low as 325k that might work.

Where I need guidance is here:  
Should I create an IRA with my wealthfront investments?  

Will my ability to buy a house be harder if all my money is invested in an IRA and 401k?  

Have I hurt myself by not using an IRA the last 10 years of investing? 

As a Native American, do I have any benefits when buying my first home (I've heard about no PMI if I don't have 20% down)?

personalfinance,Does it make sense for me to get life insurance?,"So its open enrollment time, and my company only covers $25k life insurance, I have the option to increase it, but then I have to pay.

Right now my savings is just a bit a head of my mortgage debt, but savings will start to significantly exceed my debt as we pay down the mortgage (its a 15 year) and continue to plow more into savings in the coming year(s).

Things could change if there is a baby on the horizon, but right now there isn't. I am thinking there is no real need for me to get any additional coverage. Am I wrong/missing something?

Basically, I just graduated from college. I have a good paying job and good credit, and want to apply for better credit cards (Chase Saphire and Citi Double Cash). I also want to move to the amazon store card. I also want to switch to a credit Union. 

I currently have a Bank of America account that's 4 years old, with a credit card on it. I also have the Amazon visa I've had for over a year. I wanted to cancel both of those. I have federal loans that are 5 years-4months old that impact the age of my accounts (according to credit karma). I was planning to pay off my loans fairly aggressively; the older ones have higher interest rates.

I plan to buy a house with my significant other in the next 2-4 years. I already have a car/ car loan I was approved for.

Would switching banks/canceling that card hurt me, and would they prevent my chance of getting approved for a mortgage in a few years?

Should I open the new account at the CU before closing the old account? Should I open new credit cards before closing the old ones? Should I space out the time I apply to these (three cards to replace two cards)?

personalfinance,Should i lower my monthly payments of a loan to save money instead? (ARG),"Hi Everyone,

I have been reading around in the wiki to make sure this wasn't against the rules, so hopefully this doesn't break any.

Here's the issue i need advice on:

I have a loan that i took about 2 years ago that i am paying off. A decision i made without really understanding terms and thinking ahead. BIG Lesson learned and moving forward now...

So far I have managed to cancel 52.2% of the loan, and i concentrate all my available funds(after payment of essentials as housing, food, university, etc) to reduce as much and as fast as possible that debt due to the interest rates being high and basically not wanting to have this debt weighing me down forever.

My plan to do this has been to try and pay as much as possible every month, and always paying more than the minimum amount.
In the past 10 months i have managed to reduce the amount due by 23% and by constantly paying more than the minimum required monthly payments, i managed to reduce the amount of those minimum monthly payments by 40%

Having explained all of this, my question would be as follows:

Should i pay the monthly bare minimum of the loan(which would mean, assuming no significant changes in my current finances, it would take me another 14 months to finally pay it off) and use that now available money for savings?

Since i am using all the money i can spare to pay off this loan, my savings are zero and have practically nothing to spare after paying all the bills each month(sometimes just enough for a single night out of a couple of beers at MOST)

Any thoughts?

Forex,Why does the ECB keep lowering interest rates?

Where I got this information from:
Mr Draghi announced that alongside producing its updated forecasts for the December meeting, the ECB will also review ‘a whole menu’ of monetary stimulus options. QE remains part of that menu, with Mr Draghi re-iterating a commitment to adjust the ‘size, composition and duration’ of the programme if needed. But other options are possible. **For example, it was revealed that the general council discussed the possibility of a further cut to the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.20%.** Indeed, a whole array of options are bound to be discussed in the runup to the December meeting, with Mr Draghi highlighting that the ECB is currently in a state of ‘work and assess’ rather than ‘wait and see’",finance,1446429678

electronics,Easily moddable inkjeck printer?,"I've recently started altering Magic the Gathering cards, and I would love to be able to just paint an alteration in Photoshop and be able to print this onto the original card.  
  
However the main thing with printing onto magic cards is aligning it to the paper sheet that's fed into the printer.  
So I was thinking of stripping and modding an inkjet printer to be a magic card printer, with a card holder so I can be very precise.  
  
However before I just start buying a random second hand printer, I can image they have tons of protections that will be messed up by the modding. Stuff like making sure there's enough paper, the paper guidance system, checking of the flaps are closed (which I intend to just remove).   
Most things I can probably work around, I have some experience soldering, repairing and messing with microcontrollers. I was even thinking of making one myself using arduino and a bunch of servos/motors, but I doubt I can get the precision I need.

personalfinance,"I feel trapped, I want to invest but it seems impossible.","So I'm a 23 year old Disabled person. I get SSD every month to the grand tune of about 720$ USD. As you might expect, this blows. I'm unable to work and if I tried they'd take my benefits from me. I know that sounds dire, but It's true. That said, I'm actually okay on money. My bills for a minimalistic household are 360$ a month or so because I have a roommate. But I can't help feeling trapped... Like I have nowhere to go. 

Right now I have the most money I have ever managed to save in my entire life. About 1000$. Problem is, it is considered a federal crime/breach of my benefits for me to ever have more than 2000$ in my bank account at any time. I've been warned in the past by SSI that if I'm ever tracked as having more than 2000$ in the bank I will not only lose my benefits basically forever, but could face prosecution. That's obviously fucking awful but I can't do anything about it.

That said, I don't have any debts or etc and I have healthcare. And while living on 720 a month is atrocious, I somehow manage to save about 100 off the top every month. My question is... What would my best choice be?

Do I just give up and like... Submit to a life of getting fucking shit on for being a young cripple in this country. Do I get a safe and start slowly stockpiling physical cash? Or is there some stupid thing I could invest in for the long game to make money SOMEDAY to get out of this beyond awful lower class living arrangement.

I work an average of 30 hours a week; I'm paid at $8.5/hour and end up bringing home about $950-$1000 dollars a month; my after-tax (allowances: 2 federal, 1 state) wage is around $7.5/hour.

I want to pay into the 401(k) but know I'm unlikely to have continuous employment with the restaurant for the next 12 months, meaning that matching is currently unlikely.

I have, at a maximum and after interest, $15,000 in student debt; I am paying interest seasonally. No car, low rent…I end up having over $250 in discretionary income a month. 

Emergency fund is not *currently* a necessity as my parents allow me to take short term loans from them. (I have not needed to do this for quite some time.)

I would like to contribute anywhere from 6-10%. 

My main reason for paying into the 401(k) is seeing it on my Mint.com account and knowing that I am making at least some degree of a good faith effort at saving for retirement.

The interest rate is 0.9% which adds on around £12 a month in interest. I’m currently earning below the minimum repayment salary (thanks PhD stipend) but I am paying £50 per month in an attempt to alleviate some debt-guilt. An additional complication is that despite now living in Germany and being paid in euros I have to convert some € to £ every month so my monthly loan repayments can be taken from a UK account.  
My uncle recently gave me and all my cousins a lovely and generous £5,000 gift. Part of me knows the responsible thing would probably be to just send the whole lot to Her Majesties Government but the less sensible part of me would like to save it for something a bit more special or significant.  
So my questions are…
a)	Should I just use the gift to repay my loan?  
b)	If I don’t use it for a loan repayment, how is the best/most useful/safest way to store the money?  
c)	Is internationally transferring £50 a month really worth it when the interest rate of my loan is so (I think) low? Or should I think about transferring more/less?

 I will start with income. I make $52,000 per year.  My wife makes $25,000.  I am afraid that I cannot increase this without my degree.  That leads me to the next point. 

Student loans.  I am 90% finished with my Bachelor's.  I owe $65k in student loans and I no longer have funding so my Bachelor's is on hold.  I owe the school $2,200 before I can go back.  I will begin repayment on my loans in February which I cannot afford. 

I have a $2000 credit card that has a balance at $2062 so I can no longer use it.  

My credit is shot.  It's under 500 because I have not been able to cover all of my bills in the because I lost my job and was out of work for about 4 months.  Both of my cars were repossessed and I have since paid to get the cars back and I have been current on my payments since.  I also have a credit card that was closed for non-payment during this time.

Rent $1000.  We were able to find a house big enough for the 4 of us and keep our kids at the same school.  I know this may seem high but I feel like in my area there is not much better for the price.
Utilities - $200

I managed to get my undergrad degree completely paid by academic scholarships, and put myself through (private, expensive) grad school using federal student loans (Grad PLUS). I just graduated, and landed a great job that I’ll start in about a month. I’ll be a public employee, making $125K/year...but I have no idea where to start financially. I know making good money isn’t enough to guarantee a stable financial future on its own, but I don’t know where to start with saving/spending/investing because I’ve always lived on an income bordering on uncomfortable. 

Watching my family have significant debt, I decided as a kid to never depend on credit cards - and now I’m 25, without a credit card (just applied for a Capital One secured card, thanks r/personalfinance). My fiance will be moving in with me as soon as he finds a job in the same city, which will reduce my living expenses, but I did my math assuming that I pay for everything myself. As long as I live alone, all of my living expenses combined (rent, utilities, transportation, food, fun money) will account for less than 1/3rd of my monthly disposable income after taxes and paying for health insurance. What should I be doing with the rest?


**Good stuff:**

*About to start a job making $125K/year

*Eligible for public service loan forgiveness through work - but I don’t know if that’s my best option, or whether my eligibility for IBR changes when I get married next year and then have to account for my partner’s income 

*11% of my income disappears to the state retirement plan...but my pension will vest in 5 years, and I plan to stay at this job for my entire working career if possible

*I’ve paid my own bills for years, so my credit score is okay-ish: 700

*My car is paid off

**Bad stuff:**

*Don’t have a credit card, don’t know what kind I should start with especially since I don’t have an income yet

*198K in Grad PLUS loans 
 

I’m pretty embarrassed by my complete lack of financial acumen, and trying to learn more about smart spending and saving usually just makes me really, really nervous that I’ve already missed the boat on how to be a successful adult.

I'm going to lay the question out first then my financial situation then the finances involved with the school, I'm sorry in advance because I know this is going to be a long post but I think the background information is necessary. Also sorry if any formatting or wording doesn't make sense, I tried my best and will try to clarify anything if necessary.

**My Question:** 

Am I absolutely insane for wanting to attend a school that I will go into approximately $64k worth of private loan debt for? How long will the loans affect my financial situation if I am committed to paying them back as fast as I can and make them my #1 priority?

**My situation:** 

I am 21 and have attended 2 colleges so far. One from back home was a community college I was at for 2 years paid for by me mostly out of pocket (only took out one federal subsidized when I absolutely needed it) and the college I transferred to about 8 hours away from home that I hate this is a four year public university, which I paid for with a federal unsubsidized loan and a federal subsidized loan. 

As I stated before I absolutely do not like my current university and want to transfer back to my home state and attend a private (not for profit) 4 year university there for the Winter 2016 quarter.

Currently I live in on campus apartments that I already paid for through December 10th so my current wages are all going towards buying food and gas every month, but I still never have enough money to put anything into savings.

Ultimately I want to graduate with a bachelors degree in Public Relations and find a job in the music industry side of PR. I chose this private college because they push internships with a HUGE music label and have many of their alumni working at the company. This company is my dream job. Also I am set in this career it is definitely what I want to do.

**Personal info that might be relevant:**

I have zero interest of children, ever so that's not an expense I need to worry about. I don't want to own a house as I just don't want the hassle and I would rather find a reputable landlord and rent in the city I'm moving to. Once I transfer I won't need a car or want a car as the city as pretty decent public transport. So those are all expenses I won't have.

**My Finances:**

 I currently make $8.50 an hour which is horrible and it's the lowest paying job I have ever had in my life and only get about 20 hours max a week. I was looking into getting another job but I am leaving the area in a month to go back home so I feel like no one will hire me anyway. 

My parents are paying exactly $0.00 of my college expenses. They make about $60k-75k a year which puts my EFC pretty high in consideration to what they're actually paying so I get basically no financial aid. 

I have applied for over $100,000 worth of scholarships since June and I have received NONE of them!


My current loans are in the following amounts:

Federal Subsidized #1: $1,865

Federal Subsidized #2: $2,250

Federal Unsubsidized: $1,000


My current total cash on hand is:

$241.88

I also have a Discover student card that has a balance of:

$273.61
(not due until December 19th and I have never carried a balance on this card)
So basically I have no money to my name and my car is out of gas too.



The School (costs goes by quarters so its 10 Weeks long &amp; I would do 3 quarters a year):
This is only for **ONE** quarter!

Tuition: $11,8893

Housing: $2,882

Meal Plan: $948

Activity Fee: $25

Public Transport Pass: $92

**Total Cost: $15,840**


Financial Aid awarded to me:

Federal Subsidized Loan: $1,500

Federal Unsubsidized Loan: $667

Grant from the school: $3,000

**Total Awarded to me: $5,167**

Difference between Cost and Award is: **$10,673 per quarter**

Multiply this by 6  quarters to graduate is: **$64,038** I would have total in private loans by the end of my college career plus the federal loans.

personalfinance,"Gifted $4k in stocks, sell and reinvest in HSA or Roth?","My wife was gifted ~$3900 in stocks (29 shares of PG, 20 shares of XOM) many years ago. The shares of PG were acquired in 1996, but there is no trade date listed for the XOM shares (I assume it was gifted around the same time). Regardless, my understanding is the earnings should be taxed (if sold today) at the long-term capital gains rate of 15%. Until now we hadn't touched these stocks and hadn't considered that they could be re-purposed.

It occurred to me that we could put this money into an HSA, but I'm not sure if this is the best use of the money. The HSA is with WageWorks and allows investment of anything &gt;$1000. The lowest ER options are VSCGX (0.15%) and VSMGX (0.16%). I'd prefer to choose the ETFs myself, but the rest of the options are 0.20% to &gt;1%.

**About Us:** 26M, 29F

**Income:** $115k gross (2015, we were students part of the year), $145k (2016 and onwards)

**Debt:** $176k in student loans, all graduate (interest rates 5.00-6.55%), paying above the minimum payments at ~$1950/month.

**Current savings:** Emergency fund funded, contributing to my 401k to get the 5% match, no other retirement savings. We are saving ~$1200/month going toward our honeymoon for the next few months, after which we will free it up for saving as well (just in case you were wondering where the rest of our income is going).

**Options:**

1. Use the stock proceeds to fund an HSA, either to use as a super IRA or to pay to have a baby in a year or two. I would do this by using the stock proceeds as income and adjusting my payroll to fund the HSA to it's max with the remaining 2015 paychecks, enabling us to get the triple tax advantage from payroll deductions (vs. a regular contribution).

2. Start a 2015 Roth IRA with the proceeds. Note: I'm a resident, so I chose Roth over Traditional as we will eventually be over the income limit for traditional contributions and it seems advantageous to keep the option to backdoor Roth at that time.

3. Pay off debt with the proceeds.

4. Leave the stocks as they are (I don't see an advantage to this).

Which of these is the wisest plan, or is there something else I haven't considered? Is it better to use the stock proceeds to, in effect, fund an HSA rather than a Roth? If so, should I seek out a different HSA administrator with better fund choices?

I purchased a house in 2014, mortgage is 432800 at 30 years, 4.5%. 
I am planning on refinancing this year, for 30years at 3.75%. My goal is really to reduce the interest rate, and reduce the monthly payment. I would like to pay it off as soon as I can, as I work in finance, and I am worried about job security. I am a bit on the conservative side, and want to make sure that if I have kids in the future, having a lower payment will help me be able to afford things like daycare and stuff.

Anyway, I called my creditcard company because I saw that the closing costs were a bit hirer than i expected and asked about cash advances, incase I would need some extra cash on closing. The person mentioned that if i did a balance transfer, they had a current deal that is only 3% on a balance transfer and i would have no interest until 2017 may. 

I was thinking i have pretty good credit.  Would it make sense to take out say like 30K on a  balance transfer, and paydown the mortgage more so that I save on interest and monthly payment is lower. Then spend the next year and half paying it off before the interest kicks in?

I have never done a balance transfer before. The savings on interest, seem better, and also my monthly payment for the life of the mortgage would be less. It would only be hard for the first 1.5 years that it would take me to pay it off.

Anyway what do you guys think? 

Also what do u think of the refinance ? going from 4.5 to 3.75? closing costs will be about 4.5k",finance,1446510922
personalfinance,"Higher income millennial, no consumer debt and needs tax/investment advice","Hello All,

I am 32 years old and earn approx. $170K in gross income in the US.  I have no revolving debt (no credit cards, car loans, mortgage, etc,).  I have $45k in student loans.  Single, no dependents and no significant deductions. I have six months expenses in cash along with an un-tapped emergency $30K unsecured line of credit. I plan on saving for a down-payment on a house in five years.  I think I would need approximately $150-200K for a 20% down payment in my area (NJ/NY). 
 
My federal marginal rate is 28%, I also pay state income taxes of about 6-7%.
 
I have done the following as far as retirement savings:

- On track for $18K annually in my company sponsored 401K (about a $10K match)
- On track for $3k annually in my health savings account along with a company contribution of approx. $1k.
- Have an IRA with $25K, rolled over from a previous company – I manage this on my own primarily with sector ETFs and index funds.
 
I was very bad at saving and spending in the 20s and only now cleaning up my balance sheet (was over $100K in consumer debt in 2013 and quickly de-levered when I received extra income from changing jobs).
 
Currently, after all fixed and variable expenses and retirement savings, I have about $3k/month in “excess” cash.  Someone suggested a variable universal whole life policy, but this seems very expensive from a fee perspective.  My real goal is to have access to the money on demand, earn preferential long-term capital gains and return at a reasonable rate, maybe 3-4% post-tax.  This way if there is a major event, I do have access to the cash. 
 
My thoughts were opening a brokerage account and directly investing in fixed income securities (like municipal or corporate bonds), but I think the fees would kill me there especially if I’m incrementally buying securities.  I can also more aggressively pay down my student loans, or at least the higher-interest ones (I believe at 6.2% or 6.8%), in the short-term and re-invest the minimum payments I’m making.
 
So, any suggestions or are there any creative ways I can lower my tax bill, yet also maintain some level of liquidity over this extra cash?",finance,1446513035

Do we have any options?,"A little background, my dad passed a year ago and when he did my mom put the loans on deferment.

It told me i had 4.50 in my ""available"" balance and $133.94 in my ""total balance"" so i thought, ""o i have $133.94, i can buy this and still have money for the last day of the festival"" so i got it. to shorten the rest of it, i went on spending like i had that 60$ in my account only to find out today that it was pending and i was getting charged $29 every time i went to buy a soda or a burger which eventually end up in me having - $350 in my account. Now if my calculations are correct, if i was not getting overage fees then i would only have -35.98 in my account, (which if i had known about the fees i wouldn't have bought any thing in the first place) but if the fees were to be applied at the point that the $133 of ""pending"" money ran out then i would have -122.98. i should also note that all of the over charges that too place when i ""had no money"" took place on 10/31-11/1 and all of those charges are not showing up until now (11/2). Had the over charge after buying the keyboard at Best Buy shown up, i would have turned around and returned it, but NO after spending $72 on the keyboard from my $133 ""pending"" it said i had $61.20 in my account so I assumed that every thing was fine because the bank said i had money in my account and that no over charges were placed. Okay, rant/ back story end, now my question is: How the hell do i get out of this, can i use any of this info to slap the bank in the face and only owe them -35.98 or at least -122.98. and how should i break this to my dad? i was thinking by starting out saying ""I really want to switch banks"" because after this...

Forex,[EURUSD] Waiting for a Short Signal Here...,"[Eurusd Daily Chart](http://www.theforexguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/eurusd-daily.png)

After the Fed baited the market on with more of their 'we might raise interest rate' B.S. - we seen volatility pick up on EURUSD and a breakout of the ranging market structure it was stuck it.

Breakouts like this are a breath of fresh air for swing traders - as they can be the beginnings of large broader moves.

There are two ways this could play out in our favor. The first scenario is price will move up and re-test the old consolidation support level, and confirm it is holding as new resistance by printing a large bearish price action reversal signal - such as a bearish rejection candle. This would be the golden scenario, as it would provide a very good entry price into the emerging down move.

Secondly - we actually have an inside day that is very close to the turning point on the chart here. We could see the lows breached and fuel a bearish breaking, kicking off a move that way.

I always advise to take breakouts only when they occur in the London session, when the money is behind the move. This strategy helps avoid getting caught in breakout traps.",finance,1446527718

What happens to our health insurance in 2016?,"About a month ago I made [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3mgzh6/my_34_wife_30_has_stage_iv_lung_cancer_we_have/).  

The tl;dr was my wife has stage IV lung cancer, immigrant to the US, laid off from job in early 2015, I am unable to work because wife requires full time care, living strictly off savings, we both have a 2015 Marketplace plan with subsidies, and I wanted to know:

1) I understand open enrollment for 2016 is on November 1, but will they let us keep our current plan for 2016? 

2) Since I won't have any income for 2016, will we have to pay the full premium? What happens when and if we can't afford it?

The thread blew up and I received so much helpful advice from everyone. 

This resolution may not apply and be helpful to everyone, but anyone with a non-US citizen spouse may benefit from this information should they find themselves in my situation.

I have been pretty stressed this whole month, thinking that we were going to have to pay $800 a month in healthcare premiums.  It turns out this wasn't the case.  Someone from the previous thread referenced IRS Form 8962, stating the IRS would not claw back the subsidy if you made less than 100% of the Federal Poverty Level guidelines.  I read over the form, and found that immigrants qualify for the Premium Tax Credit (PTC) if they make less than 100% of the FPL guidelines and are unable to obtain Medicaid.  Missouri didn't expand Medicaid, so this would apply to her.  

I also found where it was referenced on the healthcare.gov website.

Just one less thing to be stressed about.

tl;dr - my wife qualifies for an Advanced Premium Tax Credit and low out of pocket costs from the Marketplace

personalfinance,"Help, being pulled in too many directions","A little backstory first: I'm a 25 y/o male, married for 3 years, and graduated from college in 2012 and working a good job in Dallas.  I worked and loaned my way through school (did have financial aid though), but that's left me with about $800/month in student loans.  About $300 are Stafford loans at a 5% interest rate.  The rest are ""private"" through the state of Texas at 6%.

Now, my monthly income seems like it should be okay.  I bring in about $4260/month after everything gets taken out.  My wife and I try to basically live off of my income, because we're paying out of pocket to put her through school.  She pays for that out of her income of $1000/month, which costs just shy of $400/month.  Rent (including water, washer/dryer) is about $1350.  Also have a car payment of $274/month.

When all of the expenses are added up, we keep maybe $100 from my income, and about $600 from her income.  So, we can save about $700/month, but that never happens because shit always comes up.  Her car is old and needs work done kind of regularly.  Our cat gets sick a lot.  And she gets sick, or at least wants to see the doctor once a month.  And, she does have some student loans that are about to go into repayment, for $100/month.  Add onto that the apparent need for a vacation once a year, and we don't have hardly anything saved.

Now, I know my finances might not look as terrible as some other people's on here.  But, life has been like this for us ever since we got married.  So, we have a grand total of only about $1200 in savings.  Given our level of income, that feels absolutely shameful.  Does anyone have advice on how we can save money?

I have a housing question. My husband and I are thinking about our future and we'd like to buy a house relatively soon, but we aren't sure when would be the best time to do so. 

Here is our financial situation: combined, we earn approximately $140k gross per year. We are currently working toward paying off our loans. We will have paid off our student loans and car by March of 2016 and will have no debt at that point.

My question is this: we are looking to purchase a home, but I want to understand if we would be able to get a mortgage next year. We both have very high credit scores (790 and 810 respectively) but we won't have much down payment. We could save the 3.5% for a $275k house in our area, but not much more than that. We'd like to move before our lease ends on our apartment in June.

What do you recommend we do? Should we just continue to rent and risk the possibility of higher interest rates in 2017 by the time we have 20% saved? Or do you think we can get approved for a 3% down mortgage next year? We will have no debts.

personalfinance,Is selling my car a bad idea?,"Hello /r/personalfinance!

About a year and a half ago, I made a very dumb and inexperienced decision to buy a slightly used 2012 Subaru Impreza. I financed $22K, with an interest rate of 2.9%. My reasons for purchasing were as follows:

- I had a long commute (50 miles one way) for a new job that I was really happy to land.

-I live in Michigan, where the winters can be insane.

-I wanted to get out of my Honda, and was set on a Subaru.

-I'm dumb.

I'm finally ready to start making good financial decisions, after a long time of spending money when I wanted to. I've never been left wanting because I would just swipe my card if I wanted something. That has to change and I want it to change. I want to know if selling my Subaru and buying an older Toyota or Honda or whatever would be a good move towards financial freedom.

Here is what you should know:

I make $15/hr, working an average of 50 hours per week. This means my annual income is roughly $31K after taxes. My monthly spending for necessities (rent, utilities, groceries, retirement, etc) is about $1500. I have an emergency savings of $3K.

I now live closer to work since my lovely girlfriend got a job there as well and we got an apartment. Our daily commute is about 10 miles now, but we are in school so that changes by semester. 

What I want theoretically is to sell my Subaru and buy something I can work on. I'm handy with a wrench and prefer manual transmissions, so I think that opens up a lot of cheap options for me. 

I'm worried about a few things though. First, sunken costs. I've already lost a lot of money on this car, and I'm still under water on it. I currently owe $14.5K on it. It bluebooks at 13.5K. Second, It is probably worth less because I was rear ended by a drunk driver. The damage is minimal but it did require me filing a claim. The work was done immediately. Sadly it will show up as being in an accident which will lower it's value. I would estimate that after winter I could sell it for $13K.

So at this point, I'm not sure what I should do. I'm fine with keeping it because it's a rock solid car and I feel safe driving it. But I also don't love having payments. Considering what I've already lost on it, and what I will lose selling it, I don't know it makes sense. If I did sell it, I would be looking to pay outright on a $4K-$5K car.

Idk, buying just sounds like a serious commitment. Is this dumb?   

Then I thought... well maybe it's time to get a new car. My car is old and I've had to do major repairs already (transmission.. ouch!) and I know it's a matter of time before I need a newer one. How much should I even spend on one though? Should I finance? pay for it up-front? Guhhh    

Theeeeen I thought.. well I want my independence already.. so maybe I should just move out and rent a nice place in WeHo or a surrounding area for about $1500-$1650 for a while until my boyfriend is able to join me later when his lease is up. If I move closer to work I may not even need a new car since I could just bike or uber to it...

Bitcoin,New to Bitcoin? Some advice on active trading.,"**Here's my advice: Don't fucking do it.** Why? Let's think about what, exactly, the Bitcoin market is, in terms of active trading.

TLDR: You aren't just going against average traders. You aren't even going against good traders. You're going against the best. And it gets worse. You're playing a game that has been honed over *years* for you to lose, and others to win.

---

The market of active traders of Bitcoin is made up of a large number of individuals. Each one of these individuals is doing their best to trade for a profit. In order for you to make profit, you'd have to outsmart the majority of these players. ""That's easy!"", you say to yourself, donning your fedora, ""I'm smarter than most people! All I gotta do is use my brain!""

Alright, let's go ahead and assume for the moment that you *are* smarter than most people.

The thing is, that's not enough. Because as time goes on, the ""best"" of these traders will bleed money from the ""worst"", and the worst will simply leave as they fail to make money. As the ""worst"" leave the market, those who used to be average are now the worst, and overall, the market contains smarter, more effective traders, in a darwinian survival-of-the-fittest evolution. **To beat this market, being ""above average"" is no longer enough; you now have to be ""above above average"".**

Ever since Bitcoin has *had* a price, wealth has been flowing from bad traders to good ones; this, in turn, gives the good traders more power over the marketplace. Even if they don't ""use"" this power deliberately to affect the price (which the bigger ones can and do), **the aggregate movements of these large, effective traders far outweighs the actions of even the ""average skill"" traders.**

So now, you're not only up against a team of people who are constantly shaking out the worst players again and again. In addition, the best players on this team have the most power, and the weakest ones have the least.

So really, if you're thinking of active-trading for a profit, you're not just trying to beat the average--you're trying to beat *the best*.

 - Some have been around for several years and have incredible experience actively trading Bitcoin
 - Some have a lot of skill and experience in market trading in general, and can apply this to the Bitcoin market
 - Some have so much wealth that they can use it to move the market in their favor.

In reality, most of the successful active traders are probably some combination of the above. But wait! It gets even worse!

The Bitcoin market doesn't only have human participants, but bots as well. It's hard to say how many bots are out there trading, but it's safe to say a couple things: there are definitely enough to matter; and they are incredibly varied in their approach. **And, just like with human traders, the good bots get richer and more powerful, and the weak bots run out of money.**

So now you are faced with outsmarting not only the best *human traders*, but also the best *algorithmic traders*.

---

So here you come, with your trading strategy. However complex and nuanced your strategy is--do you really think it's *so unique* that these traders haven't seen it before? Think about it. the market has gone through *years* of darwinian survival-of-the-fittest breeding of the most viciously successful traders, and these traders have gone through several waves of noobs and hype-investors, *and* the best of these have gained wealth the whole way through. **What you face as a new trader are opponents who you literally *can't predict*, but who *can predict you*.**

It's like deciding you want to play chess for the first time, and putting money on the outcome, and choosing your opponent from a pool of grandmaster chess players. Ones who play against noobs all the time, and ones who know that your defeat means a paycheck. It's about as ruthless as it gets.

It's hopeless. Really.

---

If you think Bitcoin's cool, definitely get some. If you intend to hold for the long run, definitely get some. Then move it off the exchange and stop paying attention to the price for a few months. Remember, these traders have learned how to move the market and push the Panic button on the hivemind.

And hell, if you just want to have fun and try out trading, go ahead! But for the love of Fuck, don't invest more than you can afford to lose, with the delusion that making money actively trading is easy. It's not easy--*it's not even hard*. ""Hard"" is a videogame that's possible to beat. This is different. **You're playing a game, ultimately, that has been honed over years for you to lose, and others to win.** You'd have better luck at a casino.",cryptocurrency,1446580019

personalfinance,Need help - refinancing a car in Ohio,"I was married in April of this year. Both my wife and I had childhood and early adult issues that led to us having poor finance skills. We have worked hard to be come more responsible, but there is one hurdle we can't get past.

We have a loan for a 2010 Chevrolet Impala. This loan is at the maximum 24.99%, and we are paying about 70% interest on every payment.

The loan started 16 months ago, and we have paid an additional $2200 towards the loan (we emptied our tax returns into it). Every payment has been made on time, and usually above the required payment. According to them, we don't have to make the next 5 payments because we have paid so much extra(obvioulsy that is not our intent).

The loan is below the market value for the car, but we can't get it refinanced due to three items on her credit report, totaling about $2000. We can only get that number down to $1700.

Unfortunately, we recently have had some hardship, and have very little extra money to work with.

The loan is with Santander, and they refuse to lower the interest rate. They say they don't lower them in any circumstance.

We don't have any credit or loan options that would allow us to pay off those credit items, and pay the money back with the savings on car payments, that aren't basically the same problem as the car loan.

We have no other loans, and only a credit card with a $250 limit that we use for emergencies.

Here is my question:

Are there any places that will refinance with a high, but still lower, interest rate, specifically for cases like this one?

Any other help would be appreciated, but please hold the hindsight comments back - we are aware that a 25% loan is a bad idea, and will not make the same mistake twice.",finance,1446586413

personalfinance,Confusion on Student Loans and how to apply loan-paying strategies (and other worries).,"I have various loans out to Sallie Mae (Smart Option Student) , Navient (Also Sallie Mae Smart Option, Navient holds the account I guess), as well as Great Lakes (Stafford) that, when accumulated (along with a couple of Perkins loans, grace ending in March), account for my debts for going to school. The grace period of these end December 5. I am still unemployed (and you can provide advice with that aspect in mind if you wish), however that is not the main topic I would like answered. 

All these loans somehow set to 120 month payment (the standard as far as I am told) plans that seem to allow no room for using snowball or avalanche methods to pay them off. 

I had aspired to pay the minimums of the majority of the loans so that I may target specific loan's principals and completely wipe them off the list. I was going to target outlier interest rates as well as principals that could be squashed quickly. When calculating out the 10 year rates, the amount that I had wished to have used against a singular principal for a given is nearly wiped out to the point of being little effect.

I have been avoiding actual loan numbers, but lets say that I had hope to use ~$1000 dollars a month to pay off the interests and use the remainder against a single loan. For instance ~$500 to stave off delinquency and defaulting, ~$500 to make a nice dent in a Stafford loan.

As it stands, under the 10 year payment plan, I have less than &lt;$150 of the original 1000 per month to use against a single loan principal. This extends the time on even a targeted $2000 loan dramatically. 

I understand that the 10 year plan also works against the principal over time, but I don't want to shave chippings off the top of everything at the same time, it feels futile. I can only assume these other methods originated to attempt to eliminate this sensation. Are the nature of these loan plans actually to prevent me from approaching paying them off how I want to?

Playing devils advocate to my own situation above, maybe the intent of avalanche/snowball is to apply them in addition to the payment plan ""minimum"". If this is the case, then I have major concerns that I will not be able to achieve financial control I thought would have over my loans and I would greatly appreciate advice on how to proceed.",finance,1446597789

Married at 30 with current SO.
Get my emergency fund to 6 month's expenses-- reasonable?
Down payment on a house a few years after marriage, say, around 32 years old.  


Current take home pay right around $2,200 a month after health insurance benefit and retirement contributions. My current budget is:

* Eating out: 100/mo

* Shopping: 200/mo

* Hair/laundry: 30/mo


Total expenses: $1,438/mo.

  
**Savings:**

Emergency fund: around $5,000. My emergency fund recently took a hit because my significant other's car also broke down and she could not afford to replace it. I purchased a beater for around $4,500.

Around $4,000 invested in a Fidelity mutual fund, 70% stocks/30% bonds.

Another $2,000 in my company's retirement fund.  


**Debt:**

No student loans and going into my last semester of grad school tuition free.

13,000 remaining on car loan, 1.19% interest rate  


I realize my car expense is my most significant spending area, and here's the explanation behind that:

In the winter of 2015, the car I was driving broke down only 7 months after purchasing (all cash). Frustrated at the fact that I bought a lemon, I traded it in for a new 2014 Mazda 3 which I've been making payments on for almost a year now. I believe I got a good deal on the car, negotiating it down to $18,200 when the sticker price was right around 21K. 


Will be moving out of state next year and I'm concerned primarily with what my priorities should be moving forward and/or how I'm doing planning wise. Everything just feels so ""up in the air"" lately because I'm currently a school teacher, expecting a boost in income once I get my second degree and finish my program (currently in a two year contract with a non-profit organization).


If I wanted to downgrade my quality of life, I'd cut spending out of ""Shopping"" and ""Eating out"" categories but that includes household items and occasional mental health meals. Working full time and grad school full time, I feel like I can splurge on that a bit. Otherwise, I live very frugally.

Here's the rundown (me + spouse):

Annual | PPO | HSA
------|---|---
Cost | $2,244 | $1,764
Deductible | $600 | $3,000
OOP Max | $5,000 |  ---
Coinsurance | 10% | 0%
Avg deductible | $15 |  ---
Prescriptions | $0 | $540

PPO yearly max out of pocket w/premiums: **$7,244**

HSA yearly max out of pocket w/premiums: **$4,764**

Per month it comes out to be almost the same because of the fact that I'd have to pay for my monthly prescription ($45) out of pocket. We are both young (27) and healthy with no issues. 

I have used the spreadsheet: https://i.gyazo.com/46f690ddfa37385c1474b2d4d68dc3c1.png

I can see where the value lies in the HSA. However... I have student loans and auto debt. 

Loans: $98,032  | Rate | Type
---------------|----|----
$29,989 | 3.75% | Student, Private, Variable
$22,733 | 6.38% | Student, Federal, Fixed
$26,341 | 6.38% | Student, Federal, Fixed
$18,967 | 3.65% | Car, Fixed


I have a budget and have my expenses figured out. If all goes to plan (spouse's income), then these can be paid off in &lt;6 years. At what point does paying into an HSA outweigh the interest here based on the plans I have? For reference I am making $80k salary per year so any HSA money would be taxed at 25% and would be a pretty big savings or ""free money"". Would I still be losing more money by not paying off my loans? How much should I even put into an HSA? Initial thoughts were the $3k deductible and get it built up which is ~$750 in saved tax money, but we'd probably be fine with $1k as well.

I am contributing 6% (employer match) to my 401k which has about 5k in it. I have 1k in an old 401k as well. It's not much, but I just started all of this a couple of years ago. 

We're currently working on building up emergency fund again after moving across country. It is at about $3k right now (1 month), plan to get to $9-10k before hitting the loans hard. 

HSA max for ""family"" is $6,750. So if you look at that it'd only be $5,062 in my pocket after taxes, which is $421/mo that could go to student loans instead. You have to look at the value that the $421/mo brings versus the $1,688/yr of ""free money"" from the tax savings of the HSA. So.. how does that $421 of principle payments on the loans equal out at the end of the year based on interest accrued? This is the math I don't know how to do. Does $421/mo into the loans save more than $1,688 in interest?

Based on what I quickly did with unbury.us - the difference of paying $421/mo versus minimums on my highest loan over 1 year is ~$176 in savings in interest. This sounds extremely low and shows how much more HSA saves by giving you the tax free discount.

I don't know if any of my math is right though.

personalfinance,[Planning] 19M Here in my freshman year of college. Really struggling with what plan of action to take over the next few years. (Warning: lots of text ahead),"Hi everyone,

Over the past year of my life I have been wrestling with a major decision I will have to make relatively soon, that will no doubt affect the rest of my life.  Here is my situation…

Background:
It has always been my dream to attend the United States Coast Guard Academy for college.  For those unfamiliar, it is a federal service academy similar to that of the Naval Academy or Westpoint, but obviously for the Coast Guard.  It has an acceptance rate of ~16% but despite this, I was very confident that I would be accepted to the Academy.  Unfortunately I was waitlisted last November and did not receive an appointment.  I then committed to a smaller private school out-of-state with a good engineering program.  

I graduated high school with an International Baccalaureate Diploma (a college prep program that is pretty rigorous but has prepared me well) that helped give me 22 credits going into college and half tuition to my school (the largest scholarship they offer).  When re-picking a school my top priority was out-of-state.  I justified the much higher price of an out-of-state private school by the fact that I was reapplying to the Academy and would probably transfer after my first year (if I got in), or if that didn’t work out I would be doing Air Force ROTC, which has a strong potential to earn me a full ride.

As usual however, things haven’t gone to plan.  I do not like AFRTOC nearly as much as I thought I would.  It’s not the worst thing I have ever faced; however, it is usually a large source of depression in my life here.  When I ask myself why I do not like AFROTC it’s not because it is hard work.  I know what that is and I’m not afraid of it.  Instead it is because I do not agree with what the Air Force is…if that makes any sense.  I do not believe in what they do, the way I do with the Coast Guard.  I don’t feel like I fit in with the Gung ho attitude and probably most importantly, I don’t see myself enjoying a career in the Air Force.  

As I see it, here are my options:

1)	Continue AFROTC with the hopes of earning a scholarship but making a very long commitment to do something that makes me far from happy.  
2)	Hope I get into the CG Academy and transfer at the end of the year, which is still an appealing option to me but…
3)	I am in love with my friends, my school, and my major (mechanical engineer btw) and a significant part of me does not want to leave.  I could stay here continue on with my degree without AFROTC but of course take on a very large pile of debt in return.
4)	Or finally I could go back home and transfer to my state university, which I tried so desperately to avoid in the first place.

Finances:

My school costs me $20,0000 a year in tuition to attend.  With full room and board everything comes to $32,000 a year.  If I move off campus, get a job, and earn occasional outside scholarships (which I have done already) I could bring the room and board down significantly, taking the total down to ~$22,000 a year?   I had $20,000 in savings for college at the beginning of the year, so obviously that money will be exhausted by the end of this year.  My parents together make just over $200,000 a year.  They are separated (not sure if this is pertinent) and I am not sure if they will be getting a divorce or not.  I did not qualify for any real financial aid through FAFSA, just unsubsidized loans (which I have not accepted any yet). My parents have expressed full support in whatever I decide to do, saying they can pull money out of retirement if it’s necessary.  Obviously that is something I absolutely want to avoid.  I cannot ask my parents to make that sacrifice merely for my convenience.

By my math if I stay at my school I would graduate with ~$66,000 of debt.  With that I would most likely split it with my parents, giving them $33,000 and taking on the same amount myself.  You’ll just have to believe me when I say I am a very hard worker, and with mechanical engineering (which I love) part of me thinks I could take that on and be fine.  But then I never stop hearing in the media how crippling student debt can be, and so the other part of me is absolutely terrified to take on the debt.  With AFROTC school is free.

The storied hedge-fund manager said the Federal Reserve should have ended its post-crisis “emergency measures” by now, as he warned about excessive risk taking.
“The reason I think it’s going to end badly is at some point — over six years when you have zero rates and quantitative easing — you move investors out the risk curve,” he said late Tuesday at the annual DealBook conference in New York. “You cause emerging-market governments ... to act in ways they’ve never been able to act in history, because the markets wouldn’t have let them, [and] you cause corporations to start acting in bizarre ways, buying back twice as much stock ... at, you know, record prices.”

personalfinance,"22, paying off student loans over 5 years instead of 1 is now better financially. Suggestions/advice for reallocating income.","Questions+TL/DR: 

1.	A new policy from my employer has made paying off my loans over 5-years a better financial decision than aggressively playing them off in 10-months. Are there any suggestions for reallocating my budget given my goals of: paying off student loans, buying a car to replace my 22-year-old beauty, retiring by 65, down payment on a home+mortgage in 10-15 years, and enough money to travel occasionally/enjoy myself.

2.	I am strongly considering making a lateral move to a different position within the company by January. I would enjoy this new position more than my current one, and the new offers more room for growth. This move would mean a change in physical location, and a commute of 40 miles to work (rather than taking public transportation to my current location). So I would either move out/find an apartment or start commuting. My thoughts are that commuting while continuing to live at home with parents is better (audio books are cool), but my 1993 Saturn is dying, and I would need a newer car.  I could totally just buy a used car, but I really want to get a car for under 20k and finance it for 5-years at 300/month (specifically a Camry or Mazda3). These payments+gas would still be less than moving out now and finding an apartment. Do I buy a new car while I’m young/financially stable/wanting to own a car for 15 years? Talk me out of it?

Background: 

I’m 22. I’ve been living at home since I graduated in May and have not really had to pay any kind of living expenses. I pay $30/month for my portion of a cellphone plan where I took ownership of my family’s phone/internet bill through my employer, saving 25% off the combined bill (which my parents then pay).  My only other expenses are about $30 a week in groceries, $50/month in auto insurance, and $40/month in gas. I take public transportation into work, which I am reimbursed for, and only wind up filling my tank of gas about twice a month. My intention is to live at home for another year and half until May 2017.

Current Situation:

Take home pay after taxes, 401k, and Roth contributions is 3200/month (1600 biweekly). I only have $150/month in essential expenses, with another $200/month on top of that for eating out, registering for races, and various company outings.  My only financial goal has been to pay down my student loans ASAP while still contributing the max amount being matched into my 401k (7% being matched into 401k, and I’ve been doing 164/month into a Roth IRA). So I have been aggressively paying off my student loans with payments of 2-3k/month ($8,400 paid so far).  I just finished paying off my 3 highest interest rate loans, and I still have another 10 weeks before my grace period runs out. I also built a modest emergency fund and have a little in savings from a bonus I received. 

My employer is starting a new program in January 2016 where they will pay a matching amount of money towards student loan principal for up to $167/month for  5-years (so 10,000 over a 5-year period). I will save money over time by doing this, and I will free up the majority of my income for more savings goals (new car, moving out, home ownership, retirement). I would start paying $230/month towards loans in January when my payments actually start, with my employer putting in another $167. So I’d pay off my loans in 5 years to coincide with my employer match. 

Job security is pretty iron clad; there is no question that I could stay here as long as I want. Employees are even encouraged to move between different positions to try out new things—rather than leave the company entirely —which is one of the reasons I imagine myself staying here for 5+ years. Making use of that policy, I’m looking at making a lateral move to a different position in-house in January. I’m currently doing front-end development and the move would be towards data engineering/analysis/development/big data. I have already taken on several duties that the new job would entail (which I find more interesting than what I’m currently doing), and both bosses are okay with me making the move. The decision is mine. The data positions are also much newer/in demand, and would provide more room for growth. My big consideration is that the move would have me working at a different physical location in the region. So I would either move out of my parent’s place to find an apartment closer to work, or I would have to start commuting 40 miles to work. Since I actually have no issue with longer commutes (would be about 40-60 minutes driving each way depending on traffic), I would be far more inclined to keep living at home and just commute. Commuting would also be much better financially rather than paying rent. I will always have audiobooks to listen to.   

Now, if I were to make the move and keep living at home, I would need to replace my current car. I have a 1993 Saturn that is very much on its last legs. Well, it has been on its ‘last legs’ for about three years but refuses to die. I just don’t want to be in another position where I’m stuck in the snow or it breaks down on the way to work.  Soooo I want to finance a car for under $20k…. It is very unfortunate that I have a friend selling Toyotas, and that I could get a 2016 Camry for 18k (no pressure from him, all me asking questions). I would likely pay 1-2k down and finance the rest, with the intention of getting monthly payments to 300/month over 5 years. My justification is that I would be sitting in this thing for 1-2 hours a day for the next 18 months, and the $300/month payment + gas would still be less than the rent from moving out, finding my own place, and buying a used car.

I understand that buying new is generally considering I could just buy used, but I would really love some of the comfort/technology features in newer cars (backup camera, Bluetooth, push start, auto start). My intention would be to keep the car for 15-20 years (until self-driving cars are nice and ironed out), so this is very much a long-term thing.

I've been on the fence about buying a home for the last year or two due to dissatisfaction with my living arrangement and paying rent in general.

It states that the loan is on a 5-year ARM and after reading the FAQ I think that I understand what that means, but this line seems a little ambiguous *Subject to the floor rate of 4.25% and maximum adjustments every 5 years of 2.0% with a lifetime cap of 6%. The recent index is 1.75%.*

Does that mean that the lifetime cap of the total interest for the loan is 6%, or if the additional interest over the lifetime of the loan can't go past 6%, meaning a total interest cap of 10.25%? I could see it being read both ways, and I'm not sure whether or not that's a decent interest rate.

I just got my MSc in a technical field in August 2015 and am working as a remote contractor for $20/hr for 30-40hrs a week net since mid-August. I am working from home during this time, so 95% of my salary is savings. So far I have been contributing $1000-$1500 to my loans.

Your current age: 28

If you have a partner (age, etc): 27

If you have kids (ages, how many, etc): No kids

Where you live. Not your address (don't be silly), but a general location helps a lot: Seattle, WA

Age you would like to be FI: 50ish (I'm new to FI, don't have set goals yet, focused on debt repayment right now)

Your current assets (broken up into major categories, such as ""House"", ""Investments"", ""Rental Properties"", etc. The more details the better.): $18k value car, $6k in Vanguard 401k

Your current yearly income: $80k with 12% bonus

Preferably with details about yours, your partners, other random income, etc.: Partner is on min wage.. $13-18k per year

Your current yearly expenses: Here's a rough thing I threw together a month or so ago. This is entirely based on my income alone, as his is variable (contract work) right now. https://i.gyazo.com/5d73f4d06f77d2cbd972ebab36a28aee.png

Any plans for changes in the above (planning on getting married, planning on kids, planning on moving, planning on larger/smaller income, etc): We will get married at some point but no plans for kids. Neither of us really want them and that probably won't change (but not certain). Just spent all of our savings moving across the country, so we're happy where we're at now. Probably won't be getting much more than 2% COL raise as the company focuses more on bonuses. 



Here's the rundown (me + spouse):

Annual | PPO | HSA
------|---|---
Cost | $2,244 | $1,764
Deductible | $600 | $3,000
OOP Max | $5,000 |  ---
Coinsurance | 10% | 0%
Avg deductible | $15 |  ---
Prescriptions | $0 | $540

PPO yearly max out of pocket w/premiums: **$7,244**

HSA yearly max out of pocket w/premiums: **$4,764**

Per month it comes out to be almost the same because of the fact that I'd have to pay for my monthly prescription ($45) out of pocket. We are both young (27) and healthy with no issues. 

I have used the spreadsheet: https://i.gyazo.com/46f690ddfa37385c1474b2d4d68dc3c1.png

I can see where the value lies in the HSA. However... I have student loans and auto debt.

---------------|----|----
$29,989 | 3.75% | Student, Private, Variable
$22,733 | 6.38% | Student, Federal, Fixed
$26,341 | 6.38% | Student, Federal, Fixed
$18,967 | 3.65% | Car, Fixed


I have a budget and have my expenses figured out. If all goes to plan (spouse's income), then these can be paid off in &lt;6 years. At what point does paying into an HSA outweigh the interest here based on the plans I have? For reference I am making $80k salary per year so any HSA money would be taxed at 25% and would be a pretty big savings or ""free money"". Would I still be losing more money by not paying off my loans? How much should I even put into an HSA? Initial thoughts were the $3k deductible and get it built up which is ~$750 in saved tax money, but we'd probably be fine with $1k as well.

I am contributing 6% (employer match) to my 401k which has about 5k in it. I have 1k in an old 401k as well. It's not much, but I just started all of this a couple of years ago. 

We're currently working on building up emergency fund again after moving across country. It is at about $3k right now (1 month), plan to get to $9-10k before hitting the loans hard. 

I do hope to reach FI by 50. I think I could do it. I'm a complete newbie when it comes to investing, compounding interest, etc. So keep that in mind.

I don't know if any of my math is right:

HSA max for ""family"" is $6,750. So if you look at that it'd only be $5,062 in my pocket after taxes, which is $421/mo that could go to student loans instead. You have to look at the value that the $421/mo brings versus the $1,688/yr of ""free money"" from the tax savings of the HSA. So.. how does that $421 of principle payments on the loans equal out at the end of the year based on interest accrued? This is the math I don't know how to do. Does $421/mo into the loans save more than $1,688 in interest?

Based on what I quickly did with unbury.us - the difference of paying $421/mo versus minimums on my highest loan over 1 year is ~$176 in savings in interest. This sounds extremely low and shows how much more HSA saves by giving you the tax free discount.

**TL;DR: Should I pay into an HSA for the long run or just focus on my debts?**

I'm putting additional payments towards them to pay them off but was wondering what you guys thought about this idea. My first CC has about a 650 Balance and still 7 months to pay off before the interest rate kicks in. So if I take my money from my checking account and pay off the balance on the CC I would be left with a little bit in my checking account. This money would be moved into my savings which is low due to paying School Loans, Car payments, and these credit card bills. I would then use my credit cards to make any necessary purchases. I believe that personally I have a harder time putting money on a CC then taking it from my checking account, so I would ultimately end up spending less as a result of this and put just about every last penny I earn towards my CC Debt. I live at home still so I am taking advantage of that and putting more money towards my loans. Car loan is at .5% so I plan on riding that out. 
Example: Pay down $500 on my CC and then use CC for maybe $200 in purchases, resulting in paying 300 towards my balance.

personalfinance,21 Year Old looking for advice.,"Hey guys, I'm looking for some financial advice. Let me try and explain my situation as best as possible. I'm trying to put myself in a better position for the future.

I'm 21 years old, and I work full time making $11.50 an hour. I live at home with my dad, and my girlfriend lives with me. She works full time as well but only makes like $8.50 an hour.

For the longest time, I've had a really bad problem of spending way too much money on things that I want vs thing's that I need. I would gladly pay $1,000 for a new gadget, but would heavily debate if I wanted up spend the extra $1 at McDonald's to upsize a fry.

Let's fast forward to my current situation. Here are all my debt's (I'll spare the irrelevant details)
I owe: 
$26,500 on a 2015 Scion FR-S ($409/month for 6 years @ 3.3% interest)
$5,500 in student loans (I pay the minimum of $35 a month)
Full coverage on my car is $165/month
Just a few weeks ago I paid off my credit card, so I have zero credit card debt now.

I have buyers remorse from the car. I shouldn't have ever bought it. It now feels like a shackle to me, because me and my girlfriend would like to move out of my dad's house in 2016 and get a place of our own (Renting). As long as I have the new car, it's occupying so much of income in both the auto loan, plus insuring the car.
I have about $2,700 in my bank account. I was thinking my best course of action would be to sell the car, but it would only sell for about $23,500-$24,000.. leaving me oweing about $2,500-$3,000 on it. Should I use all my saving's to pay the difference and sell the car? If so.. I'd still need a (cheaper) replacement car.

My current idea is: Sell the car.. use my money in savings to pay the car off, thus taking a $3,000 loss. Only issue is, I'd still need a car for transportation. So I'd then need to buy a cheap car.. maybe for around $4-5,000 with a loan that I could pay off in 12-18 months.

One last thing, I started my job in late Feburary, and in August I found out there was an error on my W4 and that I had not been paying federal taxes for the last 6 months. I get direct deposit so I never saw a check stub. This has since been corrected, but still leaves me oweing probably $1,500 to the IRS by April 15th of next year. I'd like to get rid of my car before then so I can start preparing to handle that also. I'm not looking to move out until everything previous mentioned has been taken care of.",finance,1446669221

personalfinance,Due diligence before investing,"I have very little investment experience, but I have been thinking about a particular investment. It is a California company (let's call it company A) that flips houses using money from investors. Company A does this through trust deeds. The investor interest rate is quite high, which makes me weary. I called the company that owns the suites where company A is supposed to exist, and the girl on the phone confirmed that they had been a tenet for 2 years.
I wanted to look up if they have a license of some kind, but I'm not sure they need one to do what they do, or where I would go to check.
When I Google them, there are not too many results, but one result is from a legal advice site. Someone is asking if company A is ""as advertised"". They get a reply that says Company A has the highest BBB rating and no pending litigation. I checked the BBB site, and they are unaccredited but have 0 complaints in the last 3 years.
What other kinds of due diligence can I do? I live in Indiana and can't really fly to California to check out their office or projects in person. If I invested, it would basically be all the money I have saved since I started working in February.",finance,1446671387

personalfinance,Start paying early on Student Loans or continue considering first home purchase? [X-Post /r/StudentLoans],"I am 24 working as a Software Developer in the Midwest US. I have taken out Student Loans since I began college, which I started in 2010 and went 2 years for my Associates Degree at a Tech School. Upon graduation (and working 32hrs/week even before) I had a job lined up, and immediately after graduating in May 2012 proceeded to begin Evening courses at a new College in August 2012 in pursuit of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Now that I am in my final year for my Bachelors Degree (3 Math Courses Left + The Capstone), I opted not to take out any more unnecessary student loans as I have been in a new job since October 2013 which offers full Tuition Reimbursement as one of the benefits.

This is the simplified overview of my Finances. On top of this, I have about $300 flat I owe currently on my Credit Card and still owe $1,450 for having my secondary vehicle repaired to working order (not currently making payments as the mechanic is a family friend who does it on the side and has not yet served me with a final bill -- legit, just hasn't gotten around to it). Also, my Mother currnetly owes me ~$700 for helping her out with some sudden bills she had awhile back which she is paying back when she can/wishes.

&amp;nbsp;

Now then, currently I am not paying anything on Student Loans. I'm currently in half-time enrollment, and with some luck (scheduling-wise as far as what I need being offered) I will graduate May or December 2016. Once this is all said and done, my Payments should work out to roughly $385.00/mo currently, though this is by current numbers (interest is growing at about $4.12 a day).  

&amp;nbsp;

First off, I know that I will definitely save money if I stop eating out so much. Second, due to new responsibilities I should be receiving some form of raise at my job this next June, not to mention the sizable lump I expect once my Bachelors Degree is complete.

--------------------------------------------

Now, the new consideration. After running the numbers in my head compared to the local market, I've now started the process to see what I pre-qualify for in Home Loans at my local bank. I have a solid relationship with a woman who works in town (Lawyer), and while we both agree it is too soon to go in on a house together, I have begun Window shopping for a house on my own just to see if I can find a reasonable upgrade from my apartment for similar in what I'm currently paying in Rent (have paid $445/mo since May 2012 for a current total of ~$19,000).

&amp;nbsp;

I have never bought a house before, but for 24 years old feel like I have myself in a pretty solid situation and wondered if some of you could weigh in with some advice on the thought of buying a house (possibly) given what I still owe in Student Loans. While I am considering beginning to pay on my Student Loans (again, not currently) once I graduate my plan is to flat pay $500/mo if not more as finances allow -- pending the purchase of a House.

&amp;nbsp;

Can I get some opinions from you guys on how to proceed? Sorry if everything is a bit essay-like, I just wanted to get everything thoroughly detailed.

personalfinance,"Just graduated in May with a humanities degree, can't find a full-time job, hating life, and feel like getting a technical certificate would be a wise career move. However, I have no idea how to pay for it.","**Background**: I graduated from a big state university in May with a dual major in history and archaeology. Although I know that those fields are pretty worthless as BA degrees, I've had great internship experience and have a decent resume for a recent graduate. For months I thought I was in line for my dream job (different discipline) but after talking to the company, waiting and waiting for the business to start up, and feeling like the job was a sure thing, I just found out that they offered the position to somebody else. I was devastated and feel like that was my only chance at getting a job since there are just no archaeology jobs being posted that I actually qualify for, especially since my experience is out of state. I'm feeling really, really hopeless and although I was planning on going to grad school in a year or two I don't want to end up at the same spot with even more student debt. 

**The Certificate:** My alma mater offers a certificate in GIS and I feel like having that as a supplement to my background in archaeological excavation and survey would make me a much more desirable candidate. I am really tech-savvy and have a basic understanding of GIS already, so I feel like I would definitely be able to do it. I've looked around a bit and I think that getting this certificate can only help me. I would like to continue on to grad school one day and, though I am not sure about what I want to specialize in, I've seen GIS being utilized in a huge amount of ways in both history and archaeology so I can shape it as I need. It also could provide me a decent fallback if I decide to switch gears from archaeology. I know that I could teach myself these skills but, particularly since it would be difficult right now to find a job to even apply them with and I can't afford an unpaid internship, I feel like a certificate would look better on my resume.

**Money stuff:** So, I'm really fucking broke. I live at home so rent is free and work at a coffee shop that pays about $12 an hour. However, this was a rough month with unexpected expenses and I am an idiot and cut back way on hours since I thought I would be starting the dream job any day now. 

* **Current savings and checking:** I have like $200 to my name, but I'm planning on upping my hours at this coffee shop, maxing around 25/30.
* **Debt**: $11,000 in student loans, monthly payments of about $100 that will start in December. If I go back to school for this program I could defer the loans for a bit. No car payment or any other sort of monthly bills other than a few small things. 
* **Cost if I did the certificate:** My boyfriend still lives in my college town and I could hopefully live with him and his roommates for like $150 a month. ***The certificate would take 2 semesters at about $2400 each so call it $5k total. I would not be eligible for federal aid.*** I would work part time while doing this program and hopefully make at least $700-$1000 a month. I bike pretty much everywhere in that town and can be pretty frugal if I need to. I could also find a full time job over the summer to try and save up for the Fall semester. My parents are supportive but will not pay for post-undergrad education, though if I find a very professional way to do it I may be able to take out a loan from them.

**What now?:** I currently hate this coffee job and hate the city I'm living in and hate living at home, and hate the idea of continuing to do this for much longer. I think I can get into this program starting in January, and if not I would just have to figure out something to do until I can maybe do it in the fall. *I'm just not going to be able to find a good job with my degree right now and am debating whether it's a wise move to bite the bullet and take out probably about $5k in private loans for this certificate (and a life which I would enjoy much more) which would allow me to make much more in the long run.* 

**Is getting this certificate a wise move, financially and professionally? (I know this isn't /r/jobs)**

**What's the best way to pay for this? Private loans?**

**Is there a side to this situation that I haven't considered?**

Thank you guys so much!

financialindependence,"Budget Review for new grad in Seattle, WA? (Warning: Long, detailed post)","Hi Everyone,

I'll be graduating in about a month and am starting a new full time job in Seattle, WA. I'll be living in Redmond, WA, and am starting to look for housing around the area.

I've put together a tentative budget based on my total compensation, and wanted to get your feedback on if these values are realistic. I haven't done a great job of tracking expenses in college (but generally live cheaply...like most college students), so I could really use some perspective.

I've been extremely fortunate to get a high paying job, and want to take advantage of it to become FI as quickly as possible.

**Compensation Details:**

* Salary: $106,000
* Stock Grants: $30000 every year (at the 6 month, 1.5 yr, 2.5 yr, and 3.5 yr marks)
* Bonus: $10,600 (varies from 5% - 20% but 10% is a safe/standard estimate)

My employer contributes 50% of whatever I put in to my 401(k), and also puts $1000 into my HSA. My contributions *should* max out my 401(k) and my HSA by the end of the year (to $18000 and $3350 respectively). 

I am also allowed to contribute up to 15% of my salary to my Employee Stock Purchase Program. This pays out every quarter at a discount of 10% (not sure if it's based on the current price or the lower of the start/end of the period).

-----------------------------
**Notes**

* I won't be owning a car. My company provides an all access transport pass, and I do have a bike. The monthly uber budget is for those times where public transport/biking is not feasible. 
* Technology budget is to buy roughly a new phone and a new laptop every alternating year (2 year cycle for each). It will also pay for some software subscriptions should I need them to stay up to date in my industry. 
* Misc fund covers travel (visit my family across the country) and random expenses like haircuts, bike repairs, etc. Also includes Netflix, Hulu and Spotify (don't see the point in itemizing these), and any healthcare expenses I might incur (my plan is 0 premiums). 
* My ESPP pays out every 3 months. I plan on selling immediately and putting these in a taxable account.
* Emergency fund is taken care of by my college savings + signing bonus. I will have a minimum of about 1 year's living expenses in here, and it'll act as a fail-safe incase my bonus isn't high enough to cover my tax liability (if I get the minimum 5% bonus). 
* My family will continue to cover my cell phone bill 

-----------------------------

My 401(k) plan also allows for after-tax contributions and in-plan Roth distributions (aka the Mega Backdoor Roth). 

I've already contributed $18,000 + $9000 (employer match) = $27,000, so I can contribute up to $26,000 on an after-tax basis to fully max out my 401(k) (which I will then turn into a Roth IRA). I plan on selling my annual stock grant ($30000 worth) and using that to max out my after-tax 401(k) contribution.

According to an online calculator, my total federal tax liability per year (including my stock grant, salary, bonus, ESPP benefit, and deductions) is about $35,048.85. With my withholdings, I will have contributed $22,560.48, which leaves a total of $12,448.37 that I owe to the tax-man at the end of the year. I plan on using what's left of my stock grant (about $4k) and my bonus ($~10,600) to cover the rest of the tax liability. Even if I get a bonus of ~8% (fairly low end of the scale for the company), I should still be able to cover the remaining tax liability.

-----------------------------

**Final Account Balances**

* +$27,000 in my 401(k) 
* +$26,000 in my Roth IRA
* +$3,350 in my HSA
* ~+30k in a taxable account (ESPP + 1k/month from paycheck)

My taxable account will be used to save up for a house down payment in a few years.

**Specific questions for you guys:**

* How is my rent budget for a suburb of Seattle (ideally Redmond)? Is it possible to pay a total of $1600 for a small studio and utilities? I'd like to avoid having a roommate if possible.

* Is my food budget reasonable for 1 person? I don't drink much, but I do like to go out to restaurants once in a while. I will have lunch at work every day (~$200, each meal is about $10 from the cafeteria) and plan on spending $200 on groceries for breakfast/dinner/weekends and $100 on restaurants (occasional Starbucks, but also dinner with friends maybe once a week?).

* Does my tax liability and deductions/withholdings seem reasonable? This is based off of online calculators.  

* Is there any advantage in holding onto my stock grants and ESPP shares? They might be taxed at the long term capital gains rate after a year, but I don't want to be overinvested in one company (especially my employer's). 

* Any big line items I am missing on my budget? Cell phone is covered by my family plan, and random healthcare expenses will come from my misc fund. I do not plan on owning a car. 

* Any general critique/suggestions/updates? ANY feedback would be very, very helpful -- this is based off of me reading the sidebar and lots of internet sites, but I could really use a real pair of eyes to look over it.

Thank you so much guys! I'm starting work in less than 2 months, so I figured it was time to get my act together and write everything out :). Really appreciate any and all feedback!",finance,1446674063

12k in federal direct loans, @ 3.5%

My field is low paying but qualifies for PSLF (international development/education). I will be entering the Peace Corps upon graduating, which will grant me 2 years (possibly 3) of payments towards PSLF. I do not expect to make a lot of money immediately upon exiting the Peace Corps -- 50k would be very high, around 40k is more realistic. 

I did not expect this money, and was planning to utilize PSLF. I understand that the private loan should be paid off immediately, since it doesn't qualify for PSLF. I also know that the Perkins loans do not qualify, but I plan to pay them off after the Peace Corps, as each year in the Peace Corps subtracts 15% off the total (this is logical, right?). A portion will also go to an emergency fund.

This leaves me with around 30k. My question is, should I put the rest of my money towards the loans too? Or should I invest it and continue with my plan of PSLF? If I invest it, it seems that it would become a nice nest egg over the next 10 years, and will provide the needed cushion for when my forgiven loans become taxable income. But perhaps it is better to pay the loans off immediately and avoid that from even happening? To be honest, I don't know how to figure out the best path. I'm hoping you all can provide some guidance.

I have a quick story to vent. I just got off of the phone with a Bank of America customer rep due to a question I had regarding a $5 ""account maintenance fee"" I learned from my Mint account. Here's the juice:

I do most of my banking through online-only accounts (ally and discover checking) and the only real reason I had BoA is to have a brick and mortar location for cash purposes. Because of the laughable interest rate at BoA (.01%?) I keep most of my money with Ally and discover and keep only the minimum balance ($300) to avoid a fee at BoA. Now here's where it gets interesting. I was charged $5 for not having $300 in my account. Strange. I check my account balance: $295. Now, unless my math is horribly wrong (humanities major ftw), 300 - 5 = 295. The fee brought me down below 300, thus justifying the fee! Argh! So I called BoA and after 25 mins of jumping through the automated stuff and waiting I finally talked to a rep. She wouldn't rescind the charge. She didn't ""have the power"" to change it. Okaaay. I had it. I closed my account that moment. 

Lesson learned: stay on top of your fees, because they can eat you from within over the years. 

TL;DR: Charged money for not having money because BoA charged me money.",finance,1446685556

personalfinance,Didn't Pay California State Taxes,"I lived in California in 2013-2014 and tax time came around and I didn't pay my 2013 taxes, about $230. I am PRETTY SURE I still filed, just never paid. I will have to double check that. Anyways I had just moved and it was a lot of money to me at the time, not to mention I was horrible with finances then. The next year, 2014, I filed CA state taxes late, but I had a refund of about $26 (which I actually never received? Maybe they did not receive my return?) I have always done my federal taxes if this matters. I moved from Michigan and had always filed on time for both state and fed. 

My question is, does this really matter? Should I make sure all my taxes are squared up and done? What are the repercussions? And how would I go about filing/paying late taxes? Everything online I've read says pay up, but this is all information for federal taxes. Are state taxes treated the same?

I have since moved to Canada (duel citizen) also, if this matters.

Bitcoin,"If you think this is volatile, you ain't see nothing yet.","I've been watching the ups and downs of the past 24 hours and getting a little nostalgic about the relative stability of most of 2015.

I don't think the wild ride is going to end soon. I think it is going to get crazier. I think we are on the verge of the debt bubbles bursting.

All around the world Central banks have followed the Federal Reserve's lead of 0% interest rates and quantitative easing. The worldwide economy was flooded with cheap money and now every market is at its peak bubble.

Just off the top of my head we have a bond bubble, a commodities bubble, a credit card bubble, a housing bubble, a tech bubble, a student loan/university bubble, a car loan bubble. The only two markets not at their peak are Bitcoin and production (labor, wages, and products).

My prediction is the levees are going to break soon. When the Federal Reserve failed to raise interest rates (again) the Chinese responded with devaluing the Yuan. Other currencies are going to respond too. We are seeing the global currency wars hit a fever pitch. The Central Banks of the world have blown the biggest debt bubble in human history.

I wonder if Bitcoin is going to be able to absorb the overflow when this gigantic debt bubble bursts and people want out of their national currencies. Bitcoin is a special currency not because of the internet, but because it is not a debt backed currency. It is not a monetary system of usury where money begets money.

I don't know what the price will be when it is over but I am sure we are about to see the sleeping dragon of Bitcoin's volatility wake up as the bubbles start to burst.

personalfinance,"I've been paying my wife's student loans more than the monthly charge. Confused language making me wonder if I'm paying principal, or simply in advance.","For the past year or so, I've been paying off my wife's student loans.

Her recommended monthly payment for each loan is around $75. I've been paying about $250 each for the last year or so.

Today I decided to log in and look at what's up with her loans. We've made a pretty big dent, but the language they use on the site almost sounds intentionally confusing. I emailed them to see if they could clarify, but they just copy and pasted what is on the website.

**I am under this assumption:**

If the minimum monthly payment is $75 (let's say $25 interest and $50 principal), and I'm paying $250, I'd assume that $25 is going to interest and then $225 is going to the principal.

However, the email below is making it seem as though all my extra payments are simply paying the next month in advance. Meaning that I'm paying a shit ton of interest that I was trying to avoid!

That said, I'm not entirely sure, because this language is so damn confusing. I could really use the help of someone smarter than I am.

&gt; As a simple interest loan, interest accrues daily on the loan’s outstanding principal balance. After a brief processing period, payments will post to your account, effective as of the date they were received. If you are in repayment status, payments are applied to your loan as follows:
 
&gt;(a)  Payment equal to or less than the scheduled monthly payment amount.
These payments are applied first to any late fees, next to accrued interest, and then prorated across the principal balance of the loans.

&gt;(b)  Payments greater than the scheduled monthly payment amount.
If you make a monthly payment that is more than the scheduled payment amount, your minimum monthly payment will be allocated as described in (a).
 
&gt;The additional amount will then be applied first to any remaining unpaid accrued interest, then to the principal balance of the loan with the highest interest rate. If more than one loan exists with this interest rate, the payment is applied towards the unsubsidized loan (if applicable).

&gt; (c)  Extra Payments after your monthly payment has already been received.

&gt;If you make an additional payment during a month, it will be applied as described in (a).
Please note that additional or extra payments (as described in (b) and (c) above) will be applied to your loan on the date they are received and will act as a ""credit"" towards future payment requirements. This ""paid ahead"" status simply means that you are on track to pay off your loan ahead of schedule.
 
&gt;If you prefer to have an extra or higher payment reallocated, please contact us for assistance. However, because payments are generally applied to interest before the principal balance, we cannot honor requests to have payments be directed entirely to the principal balance.",finance,1446709019

personalfinance,I filed a wage dispute with my previous employer in the state of CA and just got notice of a hearing for Jan 2016. What should I expect? Should I consider legal council?,"Here is the gist of my situation

1) Full time W2 employment. Pay was based on a daily draw (first paycheck) that would then be adjusted (+/-) based on monthly production (second paycheck)

2) I took 6 weeks Paid Family Leave in June when my daughter was born, started work in Aug. Received no paycheck for all of July.

3) My first paycheck in August was 70% short of what I was expecting to get paid. The company stated that I had an accrued negative balance from January to August on my paychecks due to  my production numbers. They had been constantly adjusting on the second paycheck, which was always very light. I did not receive any adjustment reports and they sent a simple excel when I requested one to verify the heavy adjustments

4) The half the staff gives 2 week notice and decides not to deal with their crap, I send a 30 day notice (or so I thought). Ended up lawyer-ing up when they decided not to recognize my 30 day notice. My last day of work was Sept 4th and they accepted my resignation on Sept 15.

I was paid until Aug 31 and was expecting a final paycheck for my last 3 days of work. The senior manager who was communicating with my lawyer stated that the check was sent via Fedex but refused to send a tracking number. She later ended up stating that when they ran my numbers, they found that I was even more 'over paid' than originally calculated in August and they decided not to pay me anything for the 3 days that I worked.

All in I was expectin $4400 in salary and got paid $850. The lawyer told me they can be held accountable for up to 30 days penalty of my daily rate on top of the wages.

I filed a wage dispute and just got notice of my hearing today.

Here are my questions:

1) What should I expect? I can take my W2s and all the paperwork I have, but I don't have access to any of the adjustments since they never gave them to me

2) Should I consult with a lawyer? If so, what am I looking for to ask?

Recommended Action:

If after reviewing your CyberScan report you feel you are a victim of identity theft, please contact a MyIDCare Specialist at 1-800-750-3004. Our support team will provide guidance on the next step in restoring your identity.

&amp;nbsp;

So I really don't know what this is telling me. Was someone able to log into my email account? I maintain a secure password and change it periodically, and gmail never showed any suspicious account activity, so I'm doubting that one. Did someone try to use my email address while signing up for something? If so, how big an issue is the latter for me? Even if someone used my email address to sign up for something wouldn't they still need access to my account to confirm whatever they were trying to do?


You might be wondering ""why not just call 1-800-750-3004?"" I did call 1-800-750-3004, just to get some clarification on how to actually interpret this alert. I was given two options:

&amp;nbsp;

Option 1 ""if you have been mailed a pin use this option to register an account""
already done that


Option 2 ""if you don't have a pin but suspect you are a victim of identity theft select this option for assistance""
doesn't apply, but out of the two options I thought I'd try this one. The option seems to alternate between different behaviors each time you call in. Sometimes it would just recite web addresses in Spanish then return to the previous menu, sometimes it would instruct me to hold, then after about 20 minutes it returns to the previous menu.


Not selecting an option or just hitting 0 doesn't yield results. Trust me, my failure to reach a person wasn't due to a lack of patience, I've reached the VA before - and that's a telephone hold endurance challenge if ever there was one.

&amp;nbsp;

Why not message them? Well under ""contact us"" there is the phone number mentioned above, and a physical mailing address. Nowhere on the site is there an email address or option to message MyIDCare.


Anyways I'm not asking for help reaching MyIDCare, I just thought it's somewhat entertaining to share how useless this ""service"" is. I don't think there *are* any people to talk to behind it. I'm really just interested in any insight anyone might have on the alert it gave me.",finance,1446732331

personalfinance,I made a stupid purchase 3 years ago and now I'm paying for it. Help!,"There is a saying one lives and learns....

I am living, learning and now regretting a stupid financial decision I made a few years ago, and would appreciate some help on how best to deal with my dilemma. 

The good side is I now realize that what I did was stupid and I surely won't make the same mistake again. That's positive isn't it?

I'm 40, soon to be 41. I'm married with 3 kids and have been a realtor for the past 2 years, working hard every day at building my business. My wide is at school working towards a social worker's degree. We need two cars in our family, with  25-mile (one way) car pools, school etc. 

In May 2012, I was living in Chicago and purchased an overpriced 2009 VW EOS 2-door convertible from a dealer in Chicago. At the time, I had a nice 2005 Honda Accord that ran well and that I owned free and clear - it was a gift to me from a family member. I sold the Honda to Carmax for $8k and used $3,000 of the money I received as a down payment on the EOS. The rest was spent on living expenses etc. I took a 6-year car note with payments of $376 per month at 4.6% interest.

I know, I know, I know....what I did was very stupid. I didn't think so then, but I absolutely realize that now. But that's why I'm here...

After spending some time and partaking of financial wisdom on this board and others, I decided that I should try and get out of this car note if at all possible. My payoff as of today is $12k and I have 34 months of payments left at $376 a month. The car has 50k miles. It is clean, but not in pristine condition - it has a few small door dings, a few small scratches, some normal signs of minor wear and tear. It lived in Chicago from 2009 to 2013 and was driven in the snow and salt. More problematic is the fact that the car was in a freeway accident a few years ago and the repair bill came to about $6k - honestly the damage was very minor overall, front fender, headlights, etc. No frame damage at all. It was repaired by the dealer.  Looking at Craigslist, other cars of similar vintage are selling for between $5,000 - $10,000. 

My payoff is $12,000, but I don't believe I will get that for the car. I'd be lucky to get $10,000, but a more realistic figure is in the $8,000 - $8,500 range. So, I will most likely have to pay in somewhere between $2,000 and $4,000 to get out of this car note. The reason I haven't put it up for sale yet is that I need the car on a daily basis and it may have to spend a day or two in a shop getting detailed buffed and polished. 

My plan going forward is to buy a cheap higher mileage, Japanese or Korean car for under $3,000 to use in my real estate business for the next couple of years.  

I have about $20,000 in savings invested in a Vanguard....account

As I see it, I have three options:

OPTION 1.   Keep the EOS and keep making payments of $376 per month for the next 34 months. I will then have paid a total of $31k for the car by the time the note is paid off.  Wow - that's a lot! I should be able to get about $3,500 if I sell it in 3 years time. I like the car -  it's fun to drive, although not practical as a family car and if I have more than 1 adult passenger, but it sure is nice when the roof's down!

OPTION 2.   Spend a few hundred dollars getting the car cleaned up nicely, buffed etc. and try to sell it for as much as I can get. If there's a shortfall, I will have to withdraw between $2,000 - $5,000 from my savings to pay off the car loan and pay for the stupid decision I made in 2012. 

OPTION 3.	Try to lease/buy another car and roll the negative equity in the EOS into the new car. This is my least favorite option, as I am pretty gun-shy about getting into another car-payment deal right now.

I won't be going in too deep of the underlying technology behind it, cause, you know..it's boring as shit. Of course the technology part is of great importance, but it's better explained by math/computer geeks - aka smart people. In short, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network containing units (bitcoins) that can be transferred in the system with zero to low costs. These units can themselves incorporate other pieces of data. Every transaction is verified by the computers running the system. The math behind it makes it impossible for any entity to mess with this process of continuous update of the ledger. The ledger being a sort of receipt which contains all previous transactions in the network. To break the system you would need to muster up more than half of the systems combined computer power. Discounting the possibility of quantum computing this would be incredibly expensive and/or impossible. Which is why banks around the world are working with this technology (not Bitcoin but the block-chain tech) to make tradingsystems where traders can buy/sell stocks. But to understand why Bitcoin is a good hedge, we need to understand money and the fragility of our current economy, and why this might lead to a lot of demand for bitcoins.


**Money**

Money is one of man’s greatest inventions. Since we left the barter system and started using mediums of exchange, different types of mediums has been used for trading. Gold, grain, salt amongst others, gold obviously being the most famous one. The right to redeem those papers you hold in your wallet for gold ended in a peculiar fashion with the death of Bretton Woods, and ever since then, we've been trading in fiat.(1). Like art, the intrinsic value of gold is definitely questionable. Yes, everyone does seem to desire gold, still it has very limited usefulness. Paper money being a lot worse, one could argue these unredeemable paper notes are worth as much as regular paper. But the fact that you need this fiat-money to pay taxes gives the market certainty of demand in the future, which I believe is the main reason why the markets are able to attribute these notes value.


**Governmental control of money**

As fiat became the predominant transmitter of wealth in our economy, governmental control over money increased. From a naive standpoint that power shift could seem unsignificant, but I would argue it has given us a profound shift in real economic activities. Money in the form of gold had a certain inflation built in to it, since people continuously dig it up from the ground. Yet the gold-economy saw price deflation as production became more efficient, thanks to the invisible hand of the market and advancements in technology. These deflationary powers were at times greater than the inflation coming from new gold findings. This might seem a little off topic but what I want to say is that price-deflation has historically been the norm, and shouldn't be viewed as dangerous. In todays fiat-world however, we hear about central banks trying to fight deflation, believing such an environment would be bad for the labour market. The main argument being that workers have a hard time accepting lower nominal wages, and that this causes overwhelming troubles for companies when they have to cut labour costs. Although fairly logical, I think this theory is disputed by our economic history and should in my opinion definitely not be taken as a fact. However, today when we hear about central banks fighting deflation, what they're really fighting is a credit crunch. Debt, also a form of money, has been growing increasingly for quite some time, driven of course by both fiscal and monetary policy actions. A deleveraging of debt would shrink the amount of debt-money, largely concentrated in stocks/bonds/real estate. This is what central banks are fighting, their job is basically to get this overly leveraged economy, more leveraged. Needless to say, we're in uncharted territory and their might be huge systemic risks involved. Bitcoin may be one way to hedge against this.


**Government deficits and unfunded liabilities**

At which rate would you be willing to loan money to Greece? This one is really a no-brainier, meaning you shouldn't have to think to come up with an answer, since Greece wouldn't pay you back either way. Greece has a enormous debt and a whole lot of unfunded liabilities. These unfunded liabilities are mostly consisting of workers pensions and healthcare obligations to the greek people. Greek politicians will always rank these payment obligations as a higher priority expenditure than to give ""greedy speculators"" back their money. That simple fact holds true for most government bonds. Therefore I think almost all government bonds are worth substantially less than they are being priced today.  Right now the market deems these bonds as low-risk assets. For example, the U.S 10-year bond yields around 2%. In other words; you'll get close to no return (if the FED manages to reach close to its inflation target) for loaning out your money to the worlds largest debtor nation for a period of ten years. This anomaly is so great and profound, it should be viewed as a major indicator on just how messed up things have become. How did we get these absurd yields? Well, demand for bonds drive the yields down, and ever since the financial crisis central banks like the FED and ECB has been on a buying spree. Speculators joined them in their buying and have been betting on the the continuing bondpurchasing from the CB's, or holding a belief that the CB's will be unable to reach inflation targets, basically taking a bet on deflation. In a real market economy (not driven by central banks) with a low savings rate like the United States, these bonds would yield a lot more. The fact is the U.S, much like Greece, can’t repay its debt, ever, it’s impossible, nope, can’t be done. The U.S national debt is around 18 trillion dollars and their unfunded liabilities sums up to another whopping 210 trillion (as testified to congress by Boston university economic professor Laurence Kotlikoff).(2) Even though a lot of these future expenditures as Kotlikoff is including in his measurment could be slashed, some of them, like pensions, are going to be extremely unpopular to cut. If you listen to austrian economists they are pretty much all agreeing, proclaiming that the writing has been on the wall for quite some time.


**Fear of haircuts**

If this whole experiment with low interest rates fails, and economic chaos indeed ensues, I expect governments around the world to act in a similar fashion as seen in Greece/Argentine. Bank depositors will most likely have to take a haircut on their deposits to refinance the banking system. I believe the threat of this bail-in approach to reach debt-equilibrium in the financial world, will drive people to assets which cannot be confiscated. And if you don't think bail-in is a high probabilty event in your country, here's Reuters reporting on the new bail-in legislation: ""Bail-in legislation is now being extended to other EU countries, regardless of whether they're in the Euro or not.""(3).We’ve already seen some correlations of the Bitcoin price with bad economic sentiment, and I expect that trend to catch on as time proceeds. The most clear cut example of this we got during the summer, with the increase in demand for bitcoins during the Greek-crisis. The day Greece reached an agreement with its creditors- Bitcoin dropped 12%. Yet, recent volatility in global stocks has not been accompanied with upward pressure on Bitcoin. When Dow Jones fell a thousand points intraday, Bitcoin fell as well. Suggestion the link between financial instability and the value of bitcoins at least for now is rather weak. But take a look at Argentine and their post collapse economy and you'll find something very interesting. After suffering a bond market collapse and soaring inflation, it is here where bitcoin is having the most impact as an actual money transmitter. As NYT notes ”Argentine has been quietly gaining renown in technology circles as the first, and almost only place where bitcoins are being regularly used by ordinary people for real commercial transactions.”(4)


**Valuation and risk**

First of all, one should obviously not invest more than what's bearable to lose, since there's a nontrivial chance of bitcoin having the value of zero in the future. I also don't want to be responsible for anyone losing a big piece of their net worth, but if you invest your money according what someone on the internet with the name ""UngNaiv"" (young and foolish) you probably have no one to blame but yourself. Anyway, today Bitcoin have a market cap of about 4.5 billion dollars. Besides a small market cap, the uncertainty of demand and the arguably lack of intrinsic value is two of its biggest weaknesses. Even if you believe in the idea of a digital currency, Bitcoin is far from the only one out there. There's competition in the form of other cryptocurrencies with similar but different properties, and only the future will tell which of these (if any) will come out on top. As for now though, Bitcoin has established itself as the clear frontrunner. There is also a high governmental risk involved. If our political leaders start seeing this digital money as a threat to its powers of taxation, or fears grow about what it might do to enable shady transactions, it will certainly go out of its way to try and stop it. Even though the Bitcoin as a system itself is resiliencent to government intervention, one could easily foresee regulation aimed to strangle Bitcoin companies operating in the real world, making mass adoption a lot less likely. So far the western world haven’t cracked down too much on Bitcoin, in some places it has even been declared as a currency, not a commodity, meaning any potential gains in one's holding in those countries would be free from taxation. I'll leave the risks of the underlying technology to be explained by someone else, but google the words Bitcoin+fork and you'll find another very good reason not to go full retard in bitcoins.

personalfinance,How do I handle these loans that are affecting my credit score?,"I have approximately a little over 14k in student loan debt.  After taxes are taken out im bringing home about $1025 dollars every two weeks, or $26,650 a year.  This does not include any bonuses (they are not guaranteed), tax return, or any other extra income I may generate from other sources.  Just my guaranteed or reliable income.  I am also in the National Guard which generates about 200$ per drill weekend after taxes, however this is my last month so I will no longer be receiving income from the Guard, but I am still curious if there are any benefits that will apply in my situation (honorable discharge).

I have about $2,700 to my name as of today after my major bills are paid for the month.  I live in a very low cost of living area (thankfully).  

**Here are what my bills look like:**

* Rent: $375/mo.
* Car: $313.75/mo.
* TV/Internet: $80/mo.
* Insurance: $119.20/mo
* Gas: $120/mo.
* Electricity: Anywhere from $25-$75 a month depending on how much I am home
* Doctor:  Currently have a recurring payment of $44.00/mo. ($570 total)
* Food: (Don't spend much on food because this is acquired from different various sources i.e.; work etc.)
* Gym Membership: $41.92/mo.
* Various other expenses: $200-300/mo. ???


**How my loans are broken down:**

**Loan 1** is under one company but split into two separate loans but paid as one.  Part 1 of it is $634.90 @6.8%; Part 2 of it is $5,394.14 @5.75%.  Grand total of $6,029.04  I now have an automatic loan payment set up to pay off this loan in the amount of $30.82/mo. starting 11/15/15, which I am now realizing will take me 16-17 years to pay off, and probably a ton of extra money in interest.

**Loan 2** is under a different company at a total of $8,071.37 @5.779%(mixed interest?) This one has an automatic payment plan set up to start on 11/14/15 in the amount of $102.91/mo. which will take me about 6-7 years.

My monthly expenses including the way my loans are currently set up total to about $1,527.60-$1,600 a month (I don't think I am forgetting about anything) which leaves me about $400-$450 cushion per month to deal with.

**How this has affected my credit:**

I used to have a relatively good credit score (Low-mid 800's) but currently, my credit score is sitting around 575-600 depending on what credit company you are inquiring through.  What happened was, one of my student loans (they were both in forbearance/deferment) had come out of deferment (unknowingly to me, could have been an old address and/or telephone number, email, or a combination of all of them) I don't remember ever seeing a notification, and I had missed several payments before I thought to check on the deferment status through their website, only to find that I was slightly outside of the 90 day grace period, and it had been sent to collection.

I immediately acquired a credit report (through creditkarma) and show absolutely OUTSTANDING payment history on all of my accounts except for the one little gap of non deferment/forbearance with the student loans. I have always paid all of my payments on time for every single one of my bills, never missed or late a car payment, never missed or late rent, etc.  Once I realized that I was out of my deferment period, I immediately contacted both loan companies and asked them to put my back in forbearance/deferment (TEMPORARILY) just so that I could bring the account balance that was currently due back to CURRENT, and the deferments are ending the middle of this month as you can see my payment plans are set to kick in the 14th and the 15th for the loans.

I tried to contest the mishap with one of the credit companies to see if I can get that time period of missed payments removed from my credit history because of the deferment issue.  They sent me a notification saying that they had investigated the issue and ""updated my credit report"" but I don't see that it changed or helped anything and I am at a loss for what to do.

**What should I do?**

* Should I get a credit card to build my credit back up? (I don't have any, never have.)
* Should I consolidate my two student loans at the bank that I normally use to see if I can either get the interest rate for one lump sum payment down to 5.5-6%?  So that I am paying one payment to one company instead of two payments to two?
* Should I just leave it alone and let the auto monthly payments go as they are scheduled to do?  Better luck next time?

I'm 21/M and around 4k in debt to AMEX I'm still at 0% interest because I just got the card last year but that ends in March 2016, I KNOW that I won't be able to pay it off by that time, so the interest will go up to 20.24%. My FICO score is 721 as of this post.

I'm just wondering what would be my best options to pay off this debt at the lowest possible interest.

personalfinance,"Turning 30, no real income, am I making bad choices?","Long story short, I was part of a massive layoff at a tech company back in May. At the time of the layoff, I had $6,000 in my savings, received a ~$16,000 severance package and about $12,000 invested in my 401(k). The savings aren't a lot, but I only started saving in 2014 when I left a paycheck-to-paycheck type job and doubled my salary at the job after that. In July 2014 I started using YNAB to really keep track of my expenses - I used to be in a really bad place before 2014, living paycheck-to-paycheck, unable to even pay off $2,000 in credit card debt, ZERO savings, and a low credit score (I have managed to bring it up to the mid 700s in the last year).

After the layoff, I decided to finish school and earn my bachelor's degree (I had been going to school on and off while working and only completed my associate's degree in 2014). So, of course now that brings in some student loans.

I have been mostly fine since the layoffs, now six months ago, and have spent those months taking classes and working contract and consulting gigs but now I'm reaching that uncomfortable zone of ""I should really be earning an income now to take care of expenses.""

**Here is my current situation:**

* Checking (Credit Union): $3,700
* Savings (Chase): $12,300
* 401(k) from two jobs ago: $12,450

* Student Loans: ~$14,000 in direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans for one year with about 3% interest rate; I will be in school for two years max., probably. Tuition is $2,100 per term, $350 per credit, and I have 38 credits remaining
* Credit Card Debt (Bank of America): $839 

* Monthly bills: Usually about $500

That breaks down into

* Car insurance: $193
* Phone (Verizon): $100
* Internet (Comcast): $90
* Electricity/Gas: $40
* Water: $30
* Netflix, Dropbox, Spotify: $27.97

Each month I also usually end up spending:

* Groceries: $200
* Transportation: $100-200 (those trains are expensive!)
* Restaurants: Sometimes up to $200, but I have been going out less and less

Also, I had COBRA coverage after the layoff, which was about $500/mo, but just recently applied for Medicaid and waiting to hear back.

Since I have been largely unemployed since May, I've been taking contract work here and there, which is usually about $5,000-$6,000 per month per project, but obviously it's not consistent and sometimes I go without work (didn't really work at all in September). I started applying for full-time jobs to not rely so much on student loans and I don't want to start tapping into my savings if I don't have to. With my experience and profession, I could land a job anywhere $70,000-$100,000/year, but I've also been picky with the job search.

I should note I've been a little lucky as my long-term partner makes a hell of a lot more than I ever did and has been covering the rent and supportive of my choice to finish school, but I do also want to be financially independent myself, and want to be able to support my hobbies (music) when I want. My mom thinks I should just focus on school and not get a full-time job, but I don't want to become less relevant in my industry and have employers raise an eyebrow at the large gap in my resume.

Is it wise to be more choosey with a job at this time? Or since I'm turning 30 in a few months (and want to have 1 kid maybe between 30-35), am I really behind and should get hustling on securing my financial future? Was taking out student loans a mistake? What should I do? Let me know if you need more details!

Bitcoin,Top ten reasons to use bitcoin,"1. **secure online transactions.** Currently people use credit cards which are insecure for online transactions because the transaction details are reusable. A merchant (or thief) who has the credit card details can use those to charge against your account. Typically credit card companies cover this type of fraud, but in reality this ""cost"" is actually passed over to merchants who then pass the cost over to consumers. That's why in theory a merchant should be able to give bitcoin users a discount... because the layer of fraud that adds cost is no longer there. I'll also add that you get a tad bit of anonymity because you do not need to provide your name or information to merchants. So paying for pornography would be more discreet for example. 

2. **Bail-ins .** Across the world there are more and more banks who are etching in the ability to have bail in situations where when they go insolvent, the necessary funds are then taken from depositors accounts without their permission.

3. **Negative interest rates.** They are not popular across the world yet but they exist and in the unsustainable bubbles that quantitative easing cause, it could become more widespread in the future. Paying a bank to store your money (in addition to inflation) will reduce your wealth more quickly. 

4. **The borderless aspect.** Currently most money has to move traditionally through slow cumbersome systems that can typically add large fees on top. With bitcoin,  anyone could be paid and there are no borders or boundaries. This certainly has advantages in many areas... remittance for example. The savings would be even greater in the case of remittance if bitcoin was used more widely and didn't need to be converted to other currencies at each end. Capital controls are another area that fit under this feature. Some countries want to limit where you can send your money so they can keep your wealth inside the country. But maybe you just want to leave?

5. The **irreversibility** of transactions makes consumer to merchant fraud near impossible. This has special applications. There are some areas in the traditional economy where consumer to merchant fraud is rampant... such as the selling of virtual goods and probably pornography. Some argue that it is a bad thing but the point is that it is better to have irreversibility with the option to have reversibility on top than it is to have only reversibility with no irreversibility option. 

6. **Deflation.** Currently the USD is said to have 3.5 % inflation. Some reports say this is actually underestimated. If you keep large amounts of your wealth in money then you are losing more than the average person through inflation. In theory bitcoin will be deflationary but right now it is too volatile (small) to be considered either inflationary or deflationary.  There is also the obvious profit potential of bitcoin I will include here. A normal dollar has 100 units of value. so $1.00 is a dollar and 100 cents make up a dollar. Bitcoin on the other hand looks like this 1.000000000. Because there are only a maximum of 21 million coins there has to be a way for each bitcoin to represent large amounts of value. If one coin was worth a million dollars then it's smallest unit .0000000001 (one satoshi) would be worth one cent. But that isn't all.... in the future if it was necessary there could be more units added so it could be divided further. This means that even though we are not in a steady deflationary period there is tremendous profit potential. Essentially owning bitcoin means that you own not only the monetary unit but a piece of the whole infrastructure that makes up the bitcoin network.

7. **programmable money.** Some will say bitcoin is really a protocol. Just like how email is a protocol for sending messages. Bitcoin is a protocol for sending money. The value this provides is very underestimated. There will be people who will innovate with bitcoin and provide features that ordinary money simply can't do. For instance the writer of a popular blog could provide an address that they can be tipped with. Someone can tip them with bitcoin and neither of the two parties need to know any financial details of the other. The tipper doesn't need to make an account somewhere and load up their account with funds. They just send money directly to the public key that is represented by a QR code. A beggar could sit on the roadside with a sign that just displayed  the public key of their wallet. A passerby could take a picture and post it to a forum. A user of that forum could send funds directly to that beggar, using the picture as the only piece of necessary information to make the transaction. Another user will be able to send a bitcoin to their descendants... 100 years into the future in a time locked transaction. That means that the bitcoin will get carried around in their will and passed on for generation after generation until it can be spent. In 100 years. If estates were converted to bitcoin at the end of ones life the whole entire process of dividing things could be automated for example. These are just a tiny fraction of the possibilities. 

8. **Built in multi sig.** Having transactions with the ability to have multiple signers opens up the possibilities for fancy things. You could have automated escrow... where 2 of 3 signatures are needed for a transaction to process. If you and the person you are trading with agree then you would both sign. The third signature would be an escrow agent who would intervene in the case of a dispute. By having 2 of 3 signatures it means that the escrow agent cannot run away with the funds. That's just one example. Also in this category I would put the ability to break keys into n of m pieces. You can divide a key so that it requires 2 of 3 pieces to reconstruct... or 3 of 4 and so on. This makes the storage of your  bitcoins very versatile. It makes it potentially more secure than anything else you can own. For example you could break a private key into 3 of 4 pieces. 1 piece can go to the safe deposit box in a bank. 1 piece can go to another bank in a different country. 1 piece can be kept in a safe in your house. Another piece could be memorized in your head. The only way a thief could acquire your bitcoins is if they broke into 2 banks in 2 different countries and then found their way into your safe as well. If you personally wanted to retrieve the funds you would have one piece memorized, one in your safe, and pick the bank of your choosing. If you forgot the memorized key you would still be fine because there are 3 pieces left.

9. **Bitcoin 2.0.** If you haven't already figured it out yet, the money part of bitcoin is just the first application on a platform that is the bitcoin platform.  The ability to prove asset ownership is what makes the bitcoin platform have great potential.... maybe even moreso than the money aspect. Already some companies are using this aspect. A bond was issued by Patricky byre @ overstock. Degrees are being published on the blockchain. Pay and go car leasing with the agreement all done through the blockchain is being experimented with. The amount of middle men this could cut out and the amount of potential industries it could disrupt is staggering. 

10. **Monetary Sovereignty.** Mankind has never really owned their own money before. It's always been owned by their rulers. In the case of the United states that would be the Federal Reserve and it's board members . The Fed is not a part of government, but rather a private cabal.  Even when our government had a currency actually backed by reserves it was only fractionally backed and therefore just an illusion. Bitcoin gives the ability for people to actually own their own money. You can't possibly own something if someone else can dilute the value of it by making more and taking it from you through inflation. With bitcoin the amount that will be created is known and that is it.",cryptocurrency,1446770211

personalfinance,Alternatives to Ally Bank for Savings,"Basically, I'm not happy with Ally and want to switch to another bank with a high interest rate and good customer service.  I also prefer bank with a decent website and mobile app.  Unlimited ATM reimbursements is not an issue, but free transfers to other banks is a must.  And I'm not interested in a high-yield checking account that requires monthly (or any) debit transactions.  It seems like there are quite a few options for &gt;1% right now: Synchrony, MySavingsDirect, CIT Bank, GE Capital, Barclays, etc.  Anyone have experience with any of them, good or bad?  I have a Barclays credit card, and no relation with any of the other credit cards, so I'm leaning towards them.  They also have the Dream savings account, which looks like a good option in addition to a regular savings account.


I switched from Wells Fargo to Ally Bank earlier this year for that sweet 1% interest rate and great customer service I heard about on this subreddit.  Fortunately, I switched my direct deposit at work over to my Fidelity Cash Management Account, so switching from Ally is not that inconvenient.  Fidelity also offers the unlimited ATM reimbursements that Ally dropped not too long ago, so I'm covered on that front.


[Rant]

As many of you know, Ally announced over a month ago (October 2, 2015) via an email to its customers that it's planning on switching to a tiered balance approach for its rates on November 7, 2015.  While my current balance is sufficient to stay in their top tier and is likely to remain high enough for some time (probably getting married and moving next year, so maintaining a high balance to cover expenses and emergency fund), I'm seeing a trend of decline in Ally's services.  First they pulled the unlimited ATM reimbursements (which didn't really affect me).  Now they're (presumably) dropping rates for anyone that doesn't maintain a balance over $25k.  It's unlikely that I will maintain that high a balance in the long run, so it is going to hurt me eventually if I stick with them.

I'm also quite annoyed because I convinced several other people to sign up for Ally right before they made this announcement undercutting my recommendation.  

And I am rather upset that despite the email announcement, they have kept advertising the 1% rate with no minimum balance on their webpage.  It's two days until the new rates take effect, and people are signing up under the belief they'll be getting 1% regardless of balance.  Even if they did not want to announce the rates yet, there should be some indication that it's changing or that tiers are forthcoming.

personalfinance,Public Student Loan Forgiveness or Pay it Off?,"I started work for the fed government as a civilian in the us air force in Sept 2013. I have my MBA.
-
By the time I started making payments in Nov 2013, I was in 106k of student loan debt.
My parents made good money but divorced when I was 12, and are horrible with their money. Translation -- the Estimated Family Contribution of ~12.5k/year fafsa never happened. Realizing my Polysci degree was worthless after incurring ~65k of debt via tuition and interest i went an immediately got my MBA after Undergrad and lucked out.
-
~65k of this debt was federal, the other 50k private.
My job also came with an added bonus of paying off 20k of my public loans over 2 years. the catch was it was taxed as income. 
-
I currently make 71k/year -- but it isn't unreasonable to expect myself to make ~85k within 2-3 years.
I currently utilize a 2 year 0% apr card for normal food/going out purchases, and throw that additional money into loans (with the intent of bulk payoff before ever incurring interest) which allows me to essentially put aside 1500/month for loans comfortably.
-
Cognizant of the PSLF program, despite knowing the fed rates were stupidly higher than most of my private loans (with a couple exceptions,) I made it my mission in life to pay off my private loans ASAP -- figuring I'd put a dent in the private ones and then pay the minimum on the public until they were forgiven.
-
HOWEVER: I did really well on repayment. I ended up travelling a lot (including into contingency environments for an extended period of time,) that significantly accelerated my repayment.
Unfortunately, this also means I'll basically be payment the full standard payment the rest of the 8 years of my public loans, netting ~ 2 years of loan forgiveness based on my income for those first two years. (Apparently expressing frustration that the entire system is designed to help virtually everyone but me, someone who is actually doing the right things and working hard)
-
My current dillemma is whether to consolidate my remaining direct loans into non-ridiculous interest rates and just pay the whole thing off over 5-6 years or pray PSLF is still a thing 8 years from now and have ~ 20k forgiven but also pretty much guarentee I'll get that 2,500 student loan interest deduction during that time.
two years later -- my current loan total is as follows:
-
PRIVATE:
ECSI - 4.25% fixed loan -- 1.8k remaining Discover - 3.37% fixed interest -- 5.7k remaining
PUBLIC:
Great Lakes Direct Loans -36k ~ 6.8% or whatever the ""folks"" in washington jerk students with
Great Lakes Consolidated direct loans 11561 -- 6.25%
-
I'm also really confused. I think I ""am at a disadvantage"" up with my PSLF chances because i didn't originally consolidate everything -- i thought saving a few extra months would be worth it, but apparently something happened wehre the 11k loans are a repayment period of 300 payments (but still eligible for PLSF) whereas the paye program i'm on for the larger account will ""significantly disadvantage me"" over with the 8 years of standard payments after i re-file my income this year.
TLDR: thoughts on what i should do?

finance,Why is Equity Premium Puzzle A Puzzle?,"""It is founded on the basis that over the last one hundred years or so the average real return to stocks in the US has been substantially higher than that of bonds. The puzzle lies in the explaining the causes behind this equity premium."" 

I read Wikipedia over and over and I don't get what the problem is. Why would you not expect real returns on stocks to be higher than real returns on bonds? 

Relative to the person issuing bonds or buying shares, bonds are just the same reason why banks charge lower interest rates. You have less return on investment because the company is borrowing your money-you are not investing as owning a part of the company. 

Relative to the company, stocks issued can be used to raise money in investment and count as company growth. Bond money have to be repaid. 

Where is the puzzle? As for why the combined gains on the part of the person and the company regarding stocks do not equal those of bonds, that's just a matter of cohesiveness of powers. They both made reservations in dealing with bonds. It is not a combined power to put the company in a better place in the market. The company is on trading overload compared to what is invested through stocks by borrowing money and expecting higher profits, and the person is forsaking returns for safety. There is of course the issue that shares can be drawn out by each individual anytime so they can in rare instances be ""returnable"" like bonds, but ""everyone stays, nobody draws out""-isn't that the same effect on company growth as fractional banking?

MachineLearning,Confused about RNN batch sizes,"Hello everyone,

Apologies for the long wall of text, I promise I tried to keep it concise :/

I am going to start by presenting an analogy of the problem I am trying to solve.

&gt; Suppose I am monitoring the commercial activity at a shopping mall, and that my goal is to . Each customer **i** that enters the mall is monitored until he leaves it, for a duration of **n_duration(i)** minutes. At each minute, I collect **n_param** parameters on the visitor's activity. Let's say I am trying to predict **n_target** parameters (e.g., number of seconds not moving, distance to the book store over that minute), based on **n_input** parameters (e.g., number of steps walked / number of words spoken during that minute), with **n_input + n_target = n_param**. I collect this data for every customer that comes to the shopping mall after 2pm and leaves before 5pm and end up with a collection of **n_customers** input and target arrays, of respective sizes **n_duration(i)**x**n_input** and **n_duration(i)**x**n_target**.

Note: the dummy parameters presented here don't necessarily make sense, but let's suppose we can have reasonable confidence they are linked somehow.

I previously tried to train a vanilla neural network (MLP) to solve my problem, and got relatively satisfying results. One of my main problems was that the MLP could not capture the continuity in the input parameters I fed it (for instance, it is clear that the *distance to the book store* parameter shouldn't vary widely between time steps due to space-time travel limitations).

I have then tried solving my problem using recurrent neural networks with Torch. While most tutorials I found deal with classification on image / text data, I am trying to do regression over scalar quantities, therefore I had a bit of trouble troubleshooting what was wrong in my problem formulation, but hey, at least I learnt some stuff :)

Anyway, I tried training RNNs/LSTMs over my dataset, and I found that I had to deal with a batch size parameter, and I am having trouble figuring out what it does exactly.
On my old regular MLP, I would just feed it each input sample with the corresponding target, one after the other, but now I have to split my full dataset into smaller batches.

**My first question is: what exactly are these batches?**

My first understanding was that they regroup samples into sequences that are temporally linked, which I got from the description of the corresponding field in [this example](https://github.com/Element-Research/rnn/blob/master/examples/recurrent-language-model.lua#L19):

    cmd:option('--batchSize', 32, 'number of examples per batch')

However, in [https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn/blob/master/train.lua#L48](this example), the description is as follows:

    cmd:option('-batch_size',50,'number of sequences to train on in parallel')

I'm a bit confused now, as in the first case, I had in mind that the RNN processed each example after the other and learnt the time dependency that way, but the second description appears to me like a way to accelerate the training (as in parallel programming), without time consideration. In this second description, time would be taken into account through the ""sequences"" mentioned. In other words:

* Description 1 seems to say that a batch is a sequence (successive samples)

* Description 2 seems to say that a batch is a collection of sequences processed in parallel for computational efficiency

I guess both make sense on their own, but is one of these definitions more prevalent than the other? I think this particularly makes it difficult to find the right resources to learn about it (I'd be very grateful for some pointers on this matter).

**My second question is: how should the batch size influence the way I feed my dataset to the RNN?**

I used the first definition, as I based my code on this tutorial, but my understanding of it may also be flawed. In the toy example I described, each batch would correspond to a dataset relative to a given customer. However, the batch size apparently needs to be unique, which is problematic here, as customers can have very different visit durations. For instance, let's simplify and say I have three customers, that respectively stay 60, 90, and 110 minutes. Ideally, I would want to train my RNN with the first sequence of 60 samples, then 90m then 110. However, the RNN implementation requires as input a (torch.Tensor) 3D matrix of fixed size **n_batches**x**batch_size**x**n_input**, and I cannot have different sizes per batch. I tried two things:

* taking batch_size = max(sequence_sizes), here 110, and padding the shorter sequences with zeros: unsatisfying results as some sequences require adding a lot of zeros

* finding a smaller batch size that could ""make sense"", e.g. each customer goes to the bathroom every 15 minutes, but I couldn't observe anything vaguely periodic.

* deciding on an arbitrary batch size. For instance, with a batch size of 20 minutes, the first customer's 60 minutes then appear like three customers visiting for 20 minutes.

For now, I settled on the third option, as I think it was the lesser evil among these options. While I have relatively fine results after training my RNN with my dataset split like that, I am still not satisfied about my understanding of it.

My concerns are as follows:

* I lose some information relative to similar patterns across customers: for instance, each visit starts and ends in the vicinity of the entrance/exits, which does not appear anymore when splitting the dataset into smaller sequences.

* I am not sure about this one, but could some temporal discontinuity appear in the RNN's predictions? When trying to predict the behaviour of a customer staying 80 minutes, I currently have to split this dataset into four batches of 20 samples. It is not clearly visible on the resulting predicted data, but the way I see it, if the four batches are processed independently, couldn't they be discontinuous with each other? For the prediction phase, I would rather try to send a single batch of 80 samples at once in order to preserve continuity, but I get size mismatch errors when trying to do so. Are RNNs tied to a specific batch size once they're trained, or am I just doing something wrong in my code?

I realise my message is very long, so thank you very much if you've read this far.

personalfinance,I hit a milestone today and wanted to tell someone besides my dad!,"My net worth including all assets / debts surpassed $100k this week!! It's no earth shattering number but I'm pretty excited about this for a number of reasons. I don't have any new advice, but figured I would share my story in the event it helps / inspires anyone. 

I think the three biggest contributors to hitting this milestone were:

1. a big bump in pay a year and a half ago ($70k -&gt; $150k)
2. some early investing / no student loans
3. following the advice of this board

**Early 20's**

I dropped out of college after two years because I couldn't focus and had no idea what I wanted to do. After getting a job at a small software startup--making $12/hr--I learned to wear multiple hats, and essentially self-educated for the next several years (a little support, coding, IT, sales, etc.). I worked pretty hard and was able to negotiate a bump in pay every year, but after 5-6 years I hit a wall around $60-70k. 


**Late 20's** 

At this point I started shopping around and managed to find another company with an open position for sales consulting for a software company. The recruiter flat out told me what the position's salary range was, and on a whim I asked for 15% higher than the top end of the range. After proving myself in interviews they offered me what I asked--a ~100% raise---and somehow didn't ask for pay stubs from my previous employer. I don't know if I was incredibly lucky or if this is now accepted practice in tech, but nevertheless I got the opportunity and have since proved my worth. 

I can't tell you how uneasy I felt not know what my future held without having a degree, but at 29 I've managed to become an exception in a sea of statistics. And it fucking feels great. 


**Investments**

That said, my investments have not been entirely disciplined. Instead of monthly, automatic contributions mine have all been large cyclical transfers (even in my early 20's I just had a few years where I dumped ~$5k into a brokerage and then nothing for a year or two), but a lot of this was due to some aggressive traveling so I don't regret my path. 

My current allocation is:

* $58k brokerage that's mostly equities I've held forever (goog, aapl, amzn, and a few GSE's)
* $22k 401k (70% S&amp;P Vanguard fund / 30% bonds - current contribution is 12%)
* $7k roth
* $3k HSA
* $15k Ally
* $10k cash
* $3k monthly credit card debt

As you can see it's fairly aggressive, but I don't plan to buy a house anytime soon. I plan to focus my contributions over the next year in some safer investments to lower my overall risk.

I think my biggest mistakes so far are not maxing out my Roth contribution early on, trying to time the market with short term trades, and needless spending (I'm spending less today than I did 2 years ago!). I should probably be worth $150k, but I've recognized these mistakes and no longer make them. 

My biggest challenge moving forward is lifestyle creep, but every time I think about buying a used Porsche I check Mint and try to envision how much easier life will be when I'm FI. It's mostly working!",finance,1446792477

I understand I am going to be paying out the asshole for taxes, but this is easy money I am making. Why should I not favor a more aggressive approach? Note: this is coming from a guy who comes from the Ben Graham school of investing. Safe, blue-chip stocks. etc, etc.

I switched over from an mREIT that makes me 20% in a year [obviously high risk bc the REIT is highly leveraged 8.1x~, and does not have diversification to protect it from changing interest rates]. I made back 17% in 2 days. What's stopping me from getting gargantuan returns then toning down beta as I accrue more capital?

personalfinance,"22, starting job Monday, looking to be responsible.","Hi, personalfinance, I love the sub and want to be as responsible as possible when starting off.

To start:

I am 22. I start work in rural US on Monday.

I am starting with, after initial housing payments and security deposit and getting (very) basic furniture and amenities, this:

Annual salary: $45k

Starting bonus: $5k
(To be paid out on first paycheck)

Cash to my name: ~$750

Housing: $800/mo

(Unfortunately, because of how rural, the only housing I could get was a 2 bedroom appt. I hope to be able to find a roommate/transfer to a 1 br when available and cut this down by up to half)

Everything is included in my housing but electricity and cable.

Cable Internet: $60/mo

Car: paid for by dad

Debt: $4.5k 

(The only debt to my name after college is a federal perkins loan for 4.5k that I do not need to begin paying on for a few months.)

I know on Monday I will be introduced to all the benefits offered to me, including health, vision, dental, life, disability, 401k, and others. 

Talking with my dad,

Health: I am covered under his plan til 26 and thus don't need it.

Dental: do it.

401k: idk. My dad said as much as is tax deductible, but I read that is 18k a year? That seems impossible. I am unfamiliar with this topic though so please correct me. My employer does not match, though is working to be able to in the future.

All others: not worth it, though short term disability is a maybe.

I don't really know how this will be presented to me on Monday and it'd be nice to be prepped.

Groceries/Gas: I am a 2 minute walk to work, so I really doubt gas will be significant. Groceries idk as I have not needed to feed myself and do not have an approximation, but I read to plan for roughly $300.

I am planning to potentially be lonely, and am a 5 hour drive to a major city where many friends live. I do not plan to do this often, but those are potential expected expenses.

I have a credit card but no debt. I put $20-$50 on it a month and instantly just pay it off. I have read this is what a young person should do. It offers 1.5% cash back, though, so should I begin using it for more purchases? I have a limit currently of 500, but I got it in college. I'd expect I could get it increased now that I have a job?

So overall, if my guess of about $3750 a month pre-tax and taxation in a online calculator, I have (estimating):

Monthly: ~2700

After what little expenses I know now, housing, cable, groceries (est): $1500/mo

Potentially how much more of that $1500 should I expect to lose to necessary expenditures, and what do I do with the remaining?

I read that if an employer does not match 401k, I should max on a IRA first. I have a family member who works at Vanguard at has helped my brothers and sisters with that so should I seek her advice?

Are there any other glaringly obvious expenses I missed and am not planning for?

How should I use the starting bonus? I am thinking of spending up to 1000 just to ""spice up"" my living arrangement so that I will be happy. And the rest of putting into my savings account as a safety fund. Or is there a better option?

My car is a beater. I am fine with a beater, though, it is getting to/near a point I am not satisfied with concerning my safety. How do I plan for a potential need for a new (to me) used car?

The law at issue requires mortgage lenders to give people who have filed for protection under chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code 21 days’ notice before raising their mortgage payments. Under chapter 13, a person can keep big assets such as a home or car while repaying their debts over a three- to five-year period.The Justice Department said Wells Fargo acknowledged that it failed to file more than 100,000 notices involving homeowners in bankruptcy between Dec. 1, 2011, and March 31 of this year. The bank said it failed to conduct 18,000 escrow analyses in cases involving nearly 68,000 accounts of homeowners in bankruptcy during the same time period.

personalfinance,At a Precipice - Rate My Plan,"TL;DR: Should I sell all our precious metals to eradicate some of our debt and prevent an out of control snowball? How does the rest of my plan look?
____________________________________________________

Good afternoon friends,

I'm taking on the struggle of our finances and I need some advice about my upcoming decisions. Please pardon the throwaway name; it doesn't seem prudent to talk about my finances and let all my friends and family know.


Short story: My wife and I can't call on family. I haven't landed a job since my recent graduation. Our monthly minimum living cost slightly exceeds our net income. There are some medical bills from a recent accident. **I want to structure things so we can live on my wife's income and erase debt whether or not I get a job in the next few months.**

Our situation looks like this:


* $2,000 in the bank

* $2,600 monthly net income


* **Deep Savings (Metals)**

     * $15,000

* **Credit Cards**

  * $3,824/$4,600 @23% **($61 min payment)**


  * $2,897/$3,500 @19% **($46 min payment)**


  * $8,165/$8,800 @17% **($116 min payment)**


  * $13,386/$17,000 @19% **($212 min payment)**


  * $929/$1,700 @0% **($0 min payment)**


  *  **Student Loans**


  * $4,166 @3.86% (No payments 'til Jan)


  * $5,500 @4.66% (No payments 'til Jan)


* **Auto Loan**


  * $17,641.80 @APR Unknown **($355 min payment)**





**The Plan**


  * Reach out to creditors and request increased limits on 0% cards &amp; APR reduction for all others.


  * Transfer from high APR to lower APR  or 0% accounts.


  * Pay off credit cards, prioritizing highest interest and then by lowest balance.


  * Make minimum payments on student loans until all credit debt is gone.


  * Pay off student loans


  * Pay off car


  * Contribute massively to savings


  * ????


  * Profit




At minimum payments we lose $120 a month and stay in debt forever. As soon as I make my first paycheck, we start erasing debt in earnest - but as an engineer, I want safety factors. We need to make our money work for us.
I want to sell the deep savings and use it to eliminate some of the lower balance credit cards. I don't know if that's smart. Metals are at their lowest in the last 5.5 years and we'll be taking a loss; I'm struggling with the sunk cost fallacy. Is it better to wait for metals to bounce back or just grit my teeth, tighten the belt, and halt the progression of negative interest? Thanks for your help.




**UPDATE**


I goofed, but my wife helped me find the goof. The budget I drew up was representative of our expenses; the problem is that it represented an effort to stop using credit and operate with **cash only.**^facepalm So, the other $1810 was rent, utilities, groceries, fuel, home &amp; auto insurances, and phones. 



So, we fixed the budget to reflect that we would still defer daily spending with credit cards. I'm going to get a job in the next two weeks even if it's below my qualifications. We'll fill up the 0% interest card with our promotional balance transfers, then use the snowball credit payment method on the others. The numbers I have **without** me getting a job show us paying everything off in just under 2 years. Thanks for your time, guys. I'm glad to get your reassurance on selling the metals.",finance,1446828885

personalfinance,Would this refinance be a good idea?,"I am two years into an FHA home loan and am getting constant inquiries at this point about refinancing.  Honestly, I am just clueless and thought I would seek help.

Current load is FHA on an original loan amount of 212000 with an interest rate of 3.375%.  End of the day, my monthly payment is around $1520/mo.

The main problem that I have is a very high PMI that exists due to a low down payment.  And under the current rules, I will pay that PMI for the life of the loan without refinancing.

The new loan offer I got is for a 30 year fixed conventional load at 3.99% on a loan amount of $196000.  It would remove the PMI and lower my monthly payment by around $200/mo.

Is this a bad idea?  I know it adds two years back onto my loan, but putting that extra $200 into my 401K sounds appealing to me as does getting rid of the PMI.  However, moving from a 3.375% to 3.99% seems scary.  Honestly, I am just super confused.

I’m also looking to transfer a sizable chunk of money from the US to Europe and many of the experts I’ve been reading in the German press are saying we might see dollar/euro parity soon which would have the potential to save me a lot of money.

&amp;nbsp;

Income

53k gross: $1,336 every 2 weeks after tax withholding, 5% into TSP with 100% match, pension contribution, dental + vision, and life insurance (around $2,895 a month net)

&amp;nbsp;

Monthly Expenses

Rent: $0 - living at home

Car Loan: $449 with $9,065 balance, 20/48 months remaining

Car Insurance: $100

Train Pass: $176 after $130 subsidy from work

Parking: $70 (pre-tax)

Gas: $60

Spotify: $5

NBA season tickets: $287 (10 month payment plan with $718 outstanding of $2,870 total)

Student Loan: average $1,300 a month ($626 minimum payment)

Food (Eating out, grocery store, coffee, etc.): $200

Clothing: $30

&amp;nbsp;

This leaves around $218 dollars a month. There are obviously some miscellaneous expenses that I haven't included like haircuts, professional expenses, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Assets


$7,400 cash, most in high interest savings account


$4,200 TSP, contributing $100 every pay period with $100 match

&amp;nbsp;

My Student loan are all federal loans with interest rates from 3.61% to 6.55%. My current balance is $42,995. I graduated with a loan balance of around $55,500 with $52,222 being principal. I was able to pay off $2,355 in interest while in school in 2014. I also paid off $3,269 in interest in February 2015 before my grace period was over. This covered most of the accrued interest. I basically put any excess money to my student loans.

&amp;nbsp;

A little more detail about the high transportation costs. I am living at home to save money and try to pay off my student loans. This means that I spend a lot of money on a train pass and parking, along with a 2 hour each way commute. I have only made 8 of the 28 car payments so far. My mother cosigned the car and made the first 20 payments as a graduation gift. The payment will continue to be a pain in the ass for the next 2 years, but I figured it was a good deal to get a $21,000 car for around $12,600. A car is also necessary for my job.

&amp;nbsp;

I will admit the NBA season tickets were an impulse investment and it’s too early to see if it will pay off. So far, my total outlay is $3,184 ($2,870 plus additional games purchased). I have been able to bring in $965 so far with 19 pairs of tickets I haven't sold yet. I am certain that I will make a profit off of this. I'm not sure if I will continue the purchase next year because I would like to be able to move out next fall. Any money I bring in I put towards my loans.

&amp;nbsp;

I also have been able to bring in $902 over the last year in secret shopping type work. I will have to pay taxes on the proceeds.

&amp;nbsp;

Anything I’m missing? How do you think I’m doing? What will put my on the best path to moving out in the next year? I hope to be able to pay down some of my loans and be able to afford a $800 rent payment before utilities and everything else. I'm getting a raise to $64k gross in January. I know I should probably try to stay at home longer, but the 4 hours of commuting is getting rough.",finance,1446841847

Because it can a) destroy the ills of what has almost killed me twice, the petrodollar (9.11/Iraq, see www.twitter.com/markfinelli) b) make us ridiculously wealthy in 5-10 years. So, I think about Bitcoin a lot. Bitcoin will scale. Why not do it more efficiently and stronger? So, in the simplest bullet points possible, my idea (note: this idea is broad, with many details to be worked out). If you don't read the last points, there is no new idea here (note: I recently found out something like this may be happening since I initially posted on VOAT).

1) droves of wealthy people live off investment income. Unfortunately, I never had a trust fund, but growing up in Westchester County, NY and going to Hampden-Sydney, it seemed as if everyone else did. So, I'm pretty familiar. In order to get wealthy persons and the institutions that represent them to venture into Bitcoin, we need a 6%, capital locked in for two to six years, ""CD"" like instrument. People will hoard the principal and spend the income (and hoard more to get more interest). There is not a debt instrument that can be more exciting to high net worth families than Bitcoin (because principal going to the moon, and thus interest payments going to the moon). But there must be one caveat regarding interest payments (explained below) for it to spur more hodling.

2) Margin interest rates, credit cards, lines of credit in general are/can be higher than 10%, sometimes much higher. There is a spread to capture in the middle for the issuer.

3) An exchange/vault wallet company like Coinbase that is also a merchant services company, or partnership between Bitpay and Circle (or, everyone working together) will sweep 1% of monthly 6% into a ""Bitcoin Spend"" wallet (of your monthly interest payment). These funds must be spent with a Bitcoin merchant (again, any Coinbase merchant, or a Foldapp or Purse.io type of company, etc.) and/or that money is sent to a predetermined bitcoin accepting 501(c)(3) of your choice, for a deductible event. Simply, there is no hodling this 1% of interest as per agreement with the issuer.

4) Merchants will have reasons not flip 100% immediately into fiat. Merchants will hoard some bitcoin for interest, and, through the same market forces that force consumers to spend/donate bitcoin as stated above, merchants will spend on B2B. Circle closed. Additionally, such actions will spur more merchants to accept bitcoin, and so on, on so on (older people are hearing that 70s shampoo commercial in their heads). Now there is a number of really exciting reasons for merchants to accept bitcoin in addition to lower transaction fees.

5) Hodling goes up everywhere because spending. Exchange rate at $10,000 between 2nd  and 3rd halving.

Hi Jim,

Thanks I have now done so and have access to my account once again, the main issue here is that on the 5th Oct I requested the following withdrawals:

2,886 LTC &amp; 76.24 BTC

These are show in the attached screenshot as confirmed, but still pending and with no trxID as they have not been sent, kindly let me know ASAP when they will be sent as they are now one week overdue with no explanation, no apology, nothing!

I had over $50,000 on your site, that I trusted you with, maybe one of your larger long term clients and on the 5th Oct I sold it for BTC, LTC &amp; DASH, at a loss because I needed those funds right away, you sent the DASH but kept the main part of 2,886 LTC &amp; 76.24 BTC then locked me out of my account and tried to ignore me, I have no idea what is going on with your exchange but I will continue with my plans Monday to seek legal representation and pursue this matter in every relevant jurisdiction regardless of the cost and inconvenience to me, unless my funds are returned to me this week.

I would appreciate a direct contact phone number with a responsible admin who is able to resolve this mess and also the address of your company's registered offices and the advocates who represent you.

Many thanks,

Hi Jim,

Due the the continuing lack of communication and progress on withdrawing my funds the advocates that I've retained have advised that I begin with documenting this fiasco on the crypto social media, as this will have a wide reach on your client base at a low cost for me compared to when they start actions proactively themselves on my behalf.

Three days since your last curt communication and still no explanation for why the withdrawal of my funds has been disabled by you and when they will be released, they show as pending on the withdrawals page, for well over one week, but no pending withdrawals are shown on the balances page, you've simply disappeared them!

I asked for the address of your registered offices, the owners/partners names and the contact details for your advocates, this is moving ever closer to a multi jurisdiction claim for fraud and theft, my advocates require a $10,000 retainer from me which is no problem, they are not cheap but are extremely effective and any fees spent on the recovery of my funds will be added to my claim of course and I am in discussions with them about how best to denounce Cryptsy for criminal investigation and prosecution, it's totally up to you if this happens but once it begins then it will not be able to be halted.

Kindly send the info requested today &amp;/or better still my funds.

Hello email addie,
I deeply apologize for the recent delays.
We have been undergoing major site upgrades, part of which is the verification systems. Some users who have verified
accounts have been affected with these delays.
I see that you have withdrawals pending and these should now process soon as we are nearing completion of our upgrade.

If you have not received your withdrawal, by Monday October 19, please reply to this ticket and let me know.

I plan to compensate you for the inconvenience by issuing you a free upgrade to pro account status which is also included in the upgrade and will
 go live also very soon.

Hi Jim,

Why do you not even bother to reply to me anymore, do you really think that stealing 72 BTC, over $20,000 from me is something that you can just ignore?

First thing next week this goes back to the advocates that I briefed and I am paying them their requested $10,000 retainer which will also be claimed for, you have had a ton of notice but still haven't returned MY money after nearly three weeks.

I shall press the lawyers to pursue those responsible personally for civil and criminal damages, fraud and theft, in each relevant jurisdiction, kindly make sure that this is cleat to 'Vince' and the others that will end up in jail and bankrupt as a result of this.

You have until Monday to return my funds, after that the process will begin with denouncements to the police and regulators in the relevant jurisdictions and I will then have no way to prevent it all taking it's just course.

Hello email addie,

I am sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused you.
There are two separate issues going on with BTC withdrawals currently.

1: Due to the new Verifications Tier system handed to us to use, many users are frozen and flagged to become verified depending on the amounts of w/d they are making. For these, a verification agent should be contacting you soon.

2 We are experiencing some delays with BTC withdrawals and developers are working on them to get them moving again.

Looking at your account, it appears you have exceeded your withdrawal limit for your current verification tier.
Please click this link to upgrade and view the limits for your tier https://www.cryptsy.com/users/verify

Hi Elen,

Cryptsy have introduced a withdrawal limit for my account that wasn't there when I deposited the coins, this is illegal without first offering me to withdraw the my coins under the same terms and conditions as when I deposited them.

This, so called tier three level, that it says I need now takes three months to obtain, in other words you plan to rob me of my coins for three months or how ever long you feel like, this is so illegal it is untrue.

Kindly just return MY 76 BTC, approx &gt; $22,000 and do this right away with no more excuses, anything else is not an 'inconvenience' - it is theft pure and simple!

Otoh

Hi Elen,

22 days since my withdrawal request for 76 BTC was made, October 5th, and it's still stuck, conf, but pending and all that I hear from Cryptsy is being ignored or excuses.

Cancel that withdrawal immediately today so that the coins show up again in my balance, then make me tier three verified as I have been fully verified for months if not over one year and was so when I deposited those funds and had no withdrawal limits then.

Do not continue to ignore this issue, the theft of over $22,000 from my account is a serious crime and you will be held to account for it, kindly confirm that my instructions have been carried out today.

Hi Elen,

Six days and you haven't bothered to let me know when I can have MY 76 BITCOINS back, now worth over $23,000 and nearly one month that you have blocked my withdrawal.

Cancel the confirmed but stuck on pending withdrawal as requested so that my coins show up in my account balance again!

Change my verification from so called tier two to tier three, I was fully verified with you and had no withdrawal limits, the longer this goes on the more it becomes certain that you just rob the larger holders of tens of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins.

I have also requested many times, the name of the owner/s and registered office/s plus the contact details for your lawyers, it is illegal to withhold this information from your clients and the longer that this goes unresolved the greater will be the damage to your business and the more likely that you will be charged with serious theft and corruption.

Pass this email and my prior ones to Vince right away as he will be the one that will be held the most responsible for this fiasco.

Thanks,
Otoh

&amp; when I raised the issue in Cryptsy chat now I just get banned, WTG, so corrupt, unbelievable, I shall post all my emails and your lack of useful response to Reddit and BCT forum.

Hello email addie,

Another week passed and no one has contacted me, it is now over one month since I requested withdrawal of my 76 BTC and at the time I was fully verified with no W/D limits at all, same as when I deposited the coins.

Why do you treat your customers with such blase contempt, are you really intent on alienating everyone who has supported your business and especially the larger players like myself?

I find it quite unbelievable, kindly forward this to 'Vince' so at least he is aware of this totally unacceptable and illegal freezing of my funds, later today I shall be updating the total lack of promised progress yet again on Cryptsy's chat as it seems that you only pay attention to being called out publicly.

&gt;
&gt;Corporate Crime Accountability (February 1995): A Sanders amendment to the Victims Justice Act of 1995 required “offenders who are convicted of fraud and other white-collar crimes to give notice to victims and other persons in cases where there are multiple victims eligible to receive restitution.”
&gt;
&gt;Saving Money, for Colleges and Taxpayers (April 1998): In an amendment to H.R. 6, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, Sanders made a change to the law that allowed the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education to make competitive grants available to colleges and universities that cooperated to reduce costs through joint purchases of goods and services.
&gt;
&gt;Holding IRS Accountable, Protecting Pensions (July 2002): Sanders' amendment to the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 2003 stopped the IRS from being able to use funds that “violate current pension age discrimination laws.” Although he faced stiff GOP opposition, his amendment still succeeded along a 308 to 121 vote.
&gt;
&gt;Expanding Free Health Care (November 2001): You wouldn't think Republicans would agree to an expansion of funds for community health centers, which provide some free services. But Sanders was able to win a $100 million increase in funding with an amendment.
&gt;
&gt;Getting Tough On Child Labor (July 2001): A Sanders amendment to the general appropriations bill prohibited the importation of goods made with child labor.
&gt;
&gt;Increasing Funding for Heating for the Poor (September 2004): Sanders won a $22 million increase for the low-income home energy assistance program and related weatherization assistance program.
&gt;
&gt;Fighting Corporate Welfare and Protecting Against Nuclear Disasters (June 2005): A Sanders amendment brought together a bipartisan coalition that outnumbered a bipartisan coalition on the other side to successfully prohibit the Export-Import Bank from providing loans for nuclear projects in China.
&gt;
&gt;Once Sanders made it to the Senate in 2006, his ability to use amendments to advance a progressive agenda was empowered. Here are some of the amendments he passed in the Senate:
&gt;
&gt;Greening the U.S. Government (June 2007): A Sanders amendment made a change to the law so at least 30 percent of the hot water demand in newer federal buildings is provided through solar water heaters.
&gt;
&gt;Protecting Our Troops (October 2007): Sanders used an amendment to win $10 million for operation and maintenance of the Army National Guard, which had been stretched thin and overextended by the war in Iraq.
&gt;
&gt;Restricting the Bailout to Protect U.S. Workers (Feburary 2009): A Sanders amendment required the banking bailout to utilize stricter H-1B hiring standards to ensure bailout funds weren't used to displace American workers.
&gt;
&gt;Helping Veterans' Kids (July 2009): A Sanders amendment required the Comptroller General to put together comprehensive reporting on financial assistance for child care available to parents in the Armed Forces.
&gt;
&gt;Exposing Corruption in the Military-Industrial Complex (November 2012): A Sanders amendment required “public availability of the database of senior Department officials seeking employment with defense contractors” – an important step toward transparency that revealed the corruption of the revolving door in action.
&gt;
&gt;Support for Treating Autism in Military Health Care: Sanders worked with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) to pass an amendment by a vote of 66-29 ensuring that the military's TRICARE system would be able to treat autism.""",energy,1446915006

I am in my mid-20s, making ~$50k yr at my Nursing job at an Associate's Degree level.  I have been out of college for 3 years, now I'm looking to go back and finish my Bachelor's and then Master's, at a total cost of around $20k-30k.  I have a very good credit score in the mid 700s, I have owned and sold a home, now I am renting as I've moved to a new city, I have about $3000 in credit card debt that I am steadily paying off, and I do have a car payment.  After finishing my Masters I would be starting out at around $70-80k yr as a Nurse Practitioner.

It is possible for my work to reimburse most of the cost of my education but it would tie me to them for another 2 years after the completion of my Master's, effectively tying me down for a total of 5+ years, and I really don't want to be chained to my workplace, even though I like them.

I have never had a student loan before, my current education was paid through a scholarship.  I don't know the first thing about student loans except their reputation for terrible interest rates and being a pile of debt nobody can get out from under.  Will the fact that I have good credit and a good credit history get me a better student loan?  Is it advisable to do a student loan, or should I go for a private loan for the same amount and maybe get a better interest rate?

If you're wondering why I don't do consolidation now, my thought process is that I want to pay off the 6.5% in the next few months and I also enjoy the piece of mind that Fed loans provide in terms of Forbearance options in case of an emergency with such a high balance left.

The last time I enrolled in classes, I basically took the FAFSA loan money and then dropped my classes.  Really stupid, I know, but I'm trying to get things back on track. The school is saying since I never received a grade, I owe them directly instead of the federal government.  They will not release my transcripts until I pay them 4,700 dollars.  I have shot 20k in federal school loan debt on top of that.  Not a pretty situation.  

I have a CDL with over a year of current over the road trucking experirence.  I could probably land a job making 35-40k a year.  Currently I'm driving uber to see how I like it and if I would be able to do it while going to school.  It seems feasable, but now if I wanted to go back to school this spring, I would need to pay off that 4,700 dollar debt.

1. Hit the road, save up 8-10 grand, settle the 4,700, then go school next Fall.


2.  Take a lean out on my car, settle the 4,700, then go to school next Spring.


3.  Forget school, forget your dreams, become a lifetime trucker and pay off ALL this debt.

personalfinance,1099 Employee Tax Help Needed,"I am a current 1099 employee working as a graphic designer. This is first full year working for this company and so far figuring out what to expect from my taxes has been a nightmare and I could really use some help figuring out what to expect around tax time.

I started working for the graphic design company October of last year, 18 hours a week, making $1500 a month. I worked at that rate until I was brought on full time with the graphic design company in late July this year, now earning $3000 dollars a month. Before I was hired on full-time I was also working at a restaurant part time as an expediter from February to late July of this year. I then recently received a raise from my graphic design job and I now make $3500 a month.

I got some, what I believe to be bad, advice telling me that because I also had W2 employee income  on top of my 1099 income, that I was not required to pay quarterly taxes. So instead of paying quarterly taxes I put roughly 20 percent of my 1099 income into my saving account every month. To make everything more complicated I also have health insurance through the ACA and due to my income doubling halfway through the year I’m now expecting to owe a significant amount of money back of the federal subsidy I received. I’m single, not claiming any dependents nor can anyone claim me as a dependent.

My expected income for the year breaks down like this-
1099 income: $27,200
W2 income after withheld taxes: $4,200
For a total of: $31,400

I received a $180 subsidy this year from the ACA that I am no longer eligible receive, so I anticipate having to pay around $2000 back at the end of the year.

I’m fairly ignorant when it comes to doing my taxes, but from the best I can figure from filling out the 1099-ES form I am going to owe $6500 federally and $900 state tax on that income. That plus the $2,000 I am going to have to repay because of the ACA, I think brings my total amount of money I am going to owe April 15th to $9,400. Though I now think I should have been paying quarterly taxes so I think I may receive a penalty for not doing so.

Can anyone help me verify whether or not what I’ve figured out on my own is correct? Should I have been paying quarterly taxes on my 1099 income? If so, what kind of penalty should I expect? The $9,400 that I think I’ll have to pay is significantly more than the twenty percent I started saving in the beginning of the year and if I really am going to owe that money I want to be able to start budgeting appropriately now. Truly appreciate any help I can get. Thanks.",finance,1446944488
personalfinance,"Debt consolidation, I can't do it.","Hi personalfinance, I'm wondering if I can get some advice. 

I have just shy of $4000 in debt across three lines, not including student loans. I am interested in getting a loan to consolidate them and reduce my current interest rates. 

14 months ago, I went through a divorce and was a student. Since I was reliant upon married housing in a strange town I was just moving to, the divorce caused housing to revoke my campus housing, rendering me homeless for about 7 weeks. This caused me to rely on my emergency credit card, which got maxed out. I wasn't able to find work and ended up defaulting on the card and my other debts because I couldn't pay. This caused my credit score to go from 725 to 470.

I now make about $29k a year and have paid off about $5k since January when I started the job. My credit has gone back up about 75 points but I still can't get a loan to consolidate.

politics,Is Hillary the best candidate for African Americans?,"As an African American I am deeply concerned about the support for Hillary Clinton coming from the African-American community. To my view it is badly mislead. This letter discusses the thinking behind that view.

So I will start at the beginning. As a Millenial my familiarity with Hillary Clinton as a politician began in 2007 during her campaign for the nomination as Democratic candidate for President, which was against Barack Obama. During that campaign a hope was revived in America which Many of us had never seen. Barack, the promising young Senator from Illionois, ran an issues-focused campaign and ignored many of of the attacks coming from Hillary's campaign and from her surrogates, so many of the tactics employed by them went largely unnoticed and were drowned out by the hubbub of the profoundly positivity-oriented campaign which President Obama ran, although some of them did backfire quite heavily.

It is with sadness that I now feel obligated to inform people that Clinton has not been the candidate who is for African American people, as she portrays herself to be. What follows is a list of racist and/or racially divisive and inflammatory rhetoric which Hillary and her surrogates attempted to capitalize on in her race for the nomination:

[Bill Clinton's claim that Hillary Clinton is ""stronger than Nelson Mandela.""](http://progressive.org/news/2008/01/5995/obama-trounces-clintons%E2%80%99-racist-entitled-sc-campaign)

[Hillary's remarks diminishing the importance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9LhWUsrJnM) of which Rev. Jesse Jackson said ""Regrettably, they have resorted to distasteful and condescending language that appeals to our fears rather than our hopes. I sincerely hope that they'll turn away from such reactionary, disparaging rhetoric."" 


[Hillary's dogwhistling about ""kids"" who are ""super-predators""](https://twitter.com/adamjohnsonNYC/status/640719916224638976)

""They are often connected to big drug cartels. They are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called ""super-predators,"" no conscience, no empathy.""

[Geraldine Ferraro, Hillary surrogate, explains that Barack Obama is winning because he is black.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqL_sm0J8jc)

""I'm very disappointed when I see John Lewis, He's turning around, this is a civil rights leader. What in God's name did he change his vote from Hillary to Barack Obama? I'll tell you why. Because he faces- He's not gonna lose a democratic primary in his district in two years but he sure as hell will face one if he sticks it to Barack Obama when he has a greater majority of Blacks in his district. He's not gonna lose. I'm so disappointed in him I could die. I look at rosa delora, up in conneticut. She represents New Haven. Tell me- I mean I don't care what she says. Tell me why she's endorsing Barack Obama and then came to his defense...""

[Hillary making a racist ""Joke"" about Mahatma Gandhi on the Senate floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1Mq8kOXV_E) ""He [Mahatma Gandhi] ran a gas station down in St. Louis for a couple of years..."" (Senator Hillary Clinton (D) New York.)

(to be fair, Hillary later described this joke as a ""lame [sic] attempt at humor."" and stated that she regretted having made it.)

In “Blessed Experiences: Genuinely Southern, Proudly Black” Jim Clyburn writes that Bill Clinton once called him at 3AM, irate that Hillary had lost the primary in South Carolina. ""“If you bastards want a fight, you damn well will get one,” Clinton ranted. “He exploded, used the word ‘bastard’ again, and accused me of causing her defeat and injecting race into the contest,” Clyburn writes. “It was clear that the former president was holding me personally responsible for his wife’s poor showing among South Carolina black voters, and it was also clear that our heated conversation had not changed his mind,” , “Bill Clinton wasn’t just defining his wife’s loss in South Carolina as a ‘black political event,’ he was defining it as a ‘Jim Clyburn black southern event.’ So this is what he meant when he said he’d show us a fight,” wrote Clyburn. 

The day after that phone call, Clinton said ""Jesse Jackson won South Carolina in ‘84 and ‘88. Jackson ran a good campaign. And Obama ran a good campaign here,""  Clyburn interpereted the comment as dismissive of Obama's accomplishment and saw it as opening racial fault lines.

From [""Bill Clinton's 2 a.m. Phone Call to Jim Clyburn:](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/11/bill-clintons-2-am-phone-call-to-jim-clyburn)


Orlando Patterson wrote of Hillary's infamous [3AM ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yr7odFUARg) in the New York Times that ""I was left with an uneasy feeling that something was not quite right — something that went beyond my disappointment that she had decided to go negative. Repeated watching of the ad on YouTube increased my unease. I realized that I had only too often in my study of America’s racial history seen images much like these, and the sentiments to which they allude...I have spent my life studying the pictures and symbols of racism and slavery, and when I saw the Clinton ad’s central image — innocent sleeping children and a mother in the middle of the night at risk of mortal danger — it brought to my mind scenes from the past. I couldn’t help but think of D. W. Griffith’s “Birth of a Nation,” the racist movie epic that helped revive the Ku Klux Klan, with its portrayal of black men lurking in the bushes around white society. The danger implicit in the phone ad — as I see it — is that the person answering the phone might be a black man, someone who could not be trusted to protect us from this threat...For more than a century, American politicians have played on racial fears to divide the electorate and mobilize xenophobic parties. Blacks have been the “domestic enemy,” the eternal outsider within, who could always inspire unity among “we whites.” Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy was built on this premise, using coded language — “law and order,” “silent majority”""

Mark Penn, Hillary's campaign manager, may be personally responsible for planting the seed of the birther-ism later spread by Trump and the Tea Party when in March 19, 2007 he wrote, [“I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values.” and proposed targeting Obama’s “lack of American roots.”](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2008/08/penn-strategy-memo-march-19-2008/37952/)

Maggie Williams, Clinton's 2007 Campaign Manager said in response to the accusation that Hillary's campaign circulated a photo of Obama in Somali Garb that [""If Barack Obama's campaign wants to suggest that a photo of him wearing traditional Somali clothing is divisive, they should be ashamed. Hillary Clinton has worn the traditional clothing of countries she has visited and had those photos published widely.""](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/25/barackobama.hillaryclinton)

It was Hillary herself who made the incredibly polarizing and controversial comment that [""I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on, ... Sen. Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me.""](http://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2008/05/clintons-white-americans-008545#ixzz3pbJLaY6B)

[Clinton Touts White Support, NYT, May 2008](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/clinton-touts-white-support/)

and more recently Hillary has been quoted as saying in a church in Ferguson that [""All Lives Matter.""](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/24/417112956/hillary-clintons-three-word-gaffe-all-lives-matter)

Which, while true, misses the point of \#BlackLivesMatter almost entirely.

One other response Hillary had, in the context of a conversation with a \#BLM leader was [“I'll just talk to white people.”](http://spectator.org/blog/63810/hillary-clinton-says-shell-just-talk-white-people-about-blacklivesmatter)

And none of this discusses her work in expanding the drug war and mass incarceration, union busting, her hawkishness, or her [self-aggrandizing](http://www.racismreview.com/blog/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-good-for-white-feminism/) statement in her book Living History that “By the time Bill and I left the White House, welfare rolls had dropped 60 percent.” which was a fact due to not to decrease in poverty but rather a reduction in federal benefits to those living in poverty, many of them working poor. I will leave those subjects for another time.

And so in conclusion I must simply ask those who are supporting Hillary, in part due to her claim that she is strong on the issue of racial injustice: Is this really a candidate who is a strong champion for African Americans as Hillary portrays herself to be? You tell me.",energy,1446953571

worldpolitics,"Israel Out of East Jerusalem, West Bank! - Defend the Palestinians! (Workers Vanguard)","Workers Vanguard No. 1077 30 October 2015

Over the past several weeks, Israel’s murderous military apparatus and its armed settler auxiliaries have killed at least 60 Palestinians—many of them teenagers—and wounded some 2,000. The Zionist overlords have unleashed an intensified crackdown in the Occupied Territories—imposing more checkpoints, placing Palestinian neighborhoods on lockdown, dispatching thousands more soldiers and police and inciting lynch mobs in the streets. Such routine tactics are aimed at terrorizing and demoralizing the already besieged Palestinian population. Expressing the sense of utter isolation and imprisonment among the 4.8 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, one 25-year-old student from Jenin remarked, “We must get out of this situation—even if it costs us everything.” 

The latest onslaught was prepared when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu moved to restrict Palestinian access to East Jerusalem’s Al Aqsa mosque, the third-holiest site in the Muslim world and a religious and cultural gathering space for Palestinians in the city. Seizing on a handful of atomized attacks by Palestinian assailants armed with knives and screwdrivers, the Israeli government sealed off the 300,000 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem with concrete walls, demolished homes and revoked residency status for the families of alleged Palestinian attackers—essentially, as one commentator for the 972mag.com newsletter noted, “carving up and crushing the Palestinian expanse without any consideration for everyday life or for a possible future compromise.”

This is Netanyahu’s response to those who retain any remnant of hope that even the most constricted and peripheral sliver of East Jerusalem will ever be the capital of an “independent” Palestine. Since its conquest and annexation in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Jewish settlers have flooded into East Jerusalem and taken over more and more of the city from its original Palestinian residents, who are not even nominal citizens of Israel. This history of evictions has been repeatedly punctuated by acts of Zionist state and ultrarightist Jewish terror, aimed particularly at Al Aqsa (which is part of the complex that Israelis call the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism). Within months of first becoming prime minister in 1996, Netanyahu presided at the opening of a tunnel under the mosque, inciting a bloodbath in which 62 Palestinians were slaughtered. Four years later, the supposedly more liberal regime of Ehud Barak provided an armed escort for notorious racist butcher Ariel Sharon as he staged a provocative visit to the Al Aqsa compound, which helped spark the second Palestinian intifada (uprising). Now many are speculating about a “third intifada.”

The first intifada, launched in late 1987, was a deepgoing and popular organized rising by Palestinian youth who were fed up with decades of vacuous United Nations resolutions, cynical promises of Arab “solidarity” and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leadership’s passivity in the face of Zionist expansion. Yet despite several years of valorous and self-sacrificing struggle, the oppressed Palestinian masses ended up with only the miserable Oslo “peace” accords of 1993. Oslo gave birth to the PLO-controlled Palestinian Authority, a national “leadership” tasked with policing its own people on behalf of the Israeli occupiers, thus acting as subcontractors for the Zionist state. 

In the intervening years, the ghetto walls have grown insurmountable and the Palestinian people have been driven ever deeper into misery and national humiliation. Well over half of the West Bank has been confiscated from Palestinians or closed off to them, and 80 percent of the population of Gaza is dependent on humanitarian aid for its survival. Under the pretext of curbing Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist rulers of Gaza who accrued authority as a result of the PLO’s betrayals, Israel has repeatedly launched devastating attacks on the tiny Gaza Strip. Last year, nearly 2,200 largely defenseless Palestinians were slaughtered and 10,000 wounded. Gaza today is little more than a large detention camp with around 100,000 homeless residents, demolished buildings and wrecked infrastructure, all surrounded by an electrified fence.

The recent suicidal “lone wolf” stabbings are a reflection of the intense despair and frustration felt by the current generation of Palestinians. Some of the recent attacks by Palestinians have targeted Zionist agents of the occupying force: soldiers, police and their settler auxiliaries. But the indiscriminate killings of Israeli civilians are, from the standpoint of the proletariat, criminal acts of terror. Moreover, the stabbing attacks serve only to provide a further pretext for murderous Zionist repression. Such attacks reinforce the bunker state mentality that binds Israeli Jewish working people to their own exploiters and thus set back the cause of Palestinian emancipation. 

The only salvation for the Palestinian people lies in the Marxist road of proletarian internationalism: the fight for workers revolutions and a socialist federation of the Near East in which Palestinian Arabs, Israeli Jews and all the other peoples of the region will find national and social justice. So long as the struggle remains on nationalist or religious terrain, the Palestinians can only lose out to the more technologically advanced Zionist state, which is heavily armed (including with hundreds of nuclear weapons) and bolstered by billions in U.S. military aid. For its part, U.S. imperialism just put a stamp of approval on the current Zionist offensive, pledging a $1 billion hike atop its already $3.1 billion in annual military aid. It is crucial for working people and the oppressed around the world to take a stand in defense of the Palestinian people. Down with U.S. aid to Israel! All Israeli troops and settlers out of the West Bank and East Jerusalem!

The Zionist State Must Be Shattered from Within

Israeli society has moved sharply to the right in the past several decades. Netanyahu won his fourth term in office last March through overt appeals to anti-Arab chauvinism, vowing to continue the occupation and screaming that Palestinian citizens of Israel would be going “in droves to the polls.” Netanyahu accused leaders of the opposition Joint List—a coalition of Arab parties that won the third-largest number of seats in the Knesset (parliament)—of “incitement,” insinuating that they, and indeed all Israeli Palestinians, constitute a traitorous “fifth column.” In the last few weeks, many of these Palestinians who have (nominal) Israeli citizenship have been among the more than 1,000 Palestinians arrested, either for joining protests or even planning to do so. Netanyahu reached a new level of racist demagogy when he recently asserted that it was a Palestinian, the pro-German Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, and not Hitler, who instigated the genocide of European Jewry in World War II. This grotesque absurdity, an affront to all the victims of the Nazi murder machine, underlines the utter cynicism with which the Zionist rulers have wielded the Holocaust to amnesty their manifold crimes against the Palestinian people.

The reactionary mindset that was once on the periphery of Israeli society is now the common coin of many Zionist politicians. Advocates of “transfer”—the forcible expulsion of all Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, and even from within Israel itself—have moved from fringe to familiar. In March, Israel’s then foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, openly demanded the beheading of supposedly disloyal Israeli Palestinians.

Today, the mayor of Jerusalem further emboldens the fascistic and ultra-Orthodox settlers to carry out pogroms and lynchings by urging Israeli Jews to arm themselves. On October 18, more than 200 settlers attacked two Palestinian villages near the West Bank town of Hebron, setting houses ablaze with firebombs. Days later, after four Palestinians were shot by Israeli soldiers, settlers provocatively marched through Palestinian areas of Hebron under Israeli military protection. 

Amid a climate of racist hysteria, as the streets resound with cries of “Death to Arabs!” many fear being lynched by Zionist mobs. Mistaken for Arabs, some Israeli Jews have been attacked or shot dead by Zionist cops or fanatics. The daily terror to which black African immigrants in Israel are subjected was further underscored with the killing of Habtom Zarhum, a 29-year-old Eritrean asylum-seeker. Zarhum, whose only crime was that he was a black man in the vicinity of an attack at the Beersheba Central Bus Station, was shot by a security guard and then kicked and beaten by an Israeli mob as he lay dying in a pool of blood. An organizer of Zarhum’s memorial service lamented, “Israelis have a license for racism.” 

The chauvinism rife throughout Israeli Jewish society was inherent in the Zionist project of creating a “Jewish homeland” in Arab Palestine. As the founding Zionists well knew, an exclusivist Jewish state could only be carved out through the dispossession and/or expulsion of the Palestinian people. And that is how the Israeli state was established: 750,000 Palestinians were driven from their land in 1948. The small armed camps set up by handfuls of Zionist and Orthodox diehards in the Occupied Territories seized in 1967 have since mushroomed into a population of some 650,000 Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The settler zealots serve the expansionist drive for a “Greater Israel” that, in turn, fuels an ever more virulent and widespread bigotry in the Israeli population. 

The dismemberment and ghettoization of much of the Palestinian West Bank has led some Arab nationalists and liberal Zionists to abandon their former support for a “two-state solution.” Liberal Israeli journalist Gideon Levy recently remarked in a Haaretz column (17 October): “One state already exists here, and has done so for 48 years.” He went on to say that those “advocating the one-state solution are not thinking of this state—quite the opposite. They wish to undermine it and establish a different, more just and egalitarian regime. When that is established, the hatred and despair will most likely be forgotten.”

The truth of the matter is that within the framework of capitalism, there can be no just or egalitarian resolution for the Palestinian people. The Israeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab populations are interpenetrated, laying claim to the same land; under capitalism one state means one nation is dominant, i.e., the exercise of the right of national self-determination by one people necessarily comes at the expense of the other. Only in a socialist federation of the Near East can conflicting claims over land and resources be equitably resolved, and all discrimination on the basis of language, religion and nationality be eliminated. Viewed narrowly through the prism of that tiny plot of land called Israel/Palestine, this prospect appears impossible. The road to the liberation of the Palestinian masses lies in an internationalist class perspective that looks to the proletarian overthrow of bourgeois rule in Israel and also in Arab countries throughout the region (which are also home to several million Palestinians).

The stranglehold of Zionist chauvinism on the Israeli Jewish working class may today seem unbreakable. But Israel (like its Arab neighbors) is no exception to the Marxist understanding that capitalism creates its own gravedigger, the proletariat. Israel is a class-divided society, marked by huge income disparities and many political, national and ethnic fissures. In recent years, there have been protests by Jews against government austerity amid rising social discontent. The Israeli proletariat must be won to defend the Palestinian people against the Zionist ruling class, its own class enemy whose wealth is derived from the exploitation of the working class.

There is broad sympathy for the Palestinians among the well over one hundred million Arabs and many millions more Turks, Kurds, Iranians and others in the region, including significant concentrations of the industrial proletariat in Egypt, Iran and Turkey. These toilers are exploited and oppressed by their “own” ruling classes, who enforce imperialist domination. These bourgeois rulers channel justified anger against the subjugation of the Palestinians into anti-Jewish bigotry while themselves trampling on Palestinian refugees. In the course of intense class struggle and through the intervention of revolutionary Marxist parties, the workers of the Near East must be broken from all-sided bigotry and come to understand that they share a common historic interest in fighting to sweep away all the capitalist ruling classes of the region. The International Communist League, of which the Spartacist League is the U.S. section, fights to build Leninist vanguard parties to lead the struggle for a socialist federation of the Near East.

Down With U.S. Imperialism!

U.S. capitalist politicians, continuing their cynical talk about a “peace” deal, call for “calm” on both sides. In a piece in the New Yorker (12 October), Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi, a prominent defender of Palestinian rights, aptly comments that Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas’s recent acknowledgment of the failure of the Oslo process “was long overdue.” The 1993 Oslo accords were part of an effort by U.S. imperialism to impose a “Pax Americana” on the Near East in the wake of the counterrevolutionary destruction of the Soviet Union, which had provided crucial diplomatic support and aid to the PLO and various Arab nationalist regimes. The accords were never intended to lead to a Palestinian state in the Occupied Territories, as their leftist and nationalist promoters claimed. At the time, in an article headlined “Israel-PLO Deal for Palestinian Ghetto,” we pointed out that Oslo “does not offer even the most deformed expression of self-determination” and “would place the PLO’s seal on the national oppression of the long-suffering Palestinian Arab masses” (WV No. 583, 10 September 1993). We warned that the PLO’s political bankruptcy would allow anti-woman and anti-Jewish Islamic reactionaries such as Hamas to gain influence among the historically cosmopolitan Palestinian masses. 

Khalidi concludes his piece by advising America’s imperialist rulers to “stop hiding behind the fictions of Oslo” and “act vigorously to end a system of military occupation and colonization that would crumble without their support.” Khalidi’s view is shared by many in the Palestinian solidarity milieu in the U.S., especially those around the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Their appeals, directed in the first instance at university administrations and other institutions of corporate America, are aimed at getting U.S. imperialism to pressure its Zionist junior partners to ameliorate the plight of the Palestinians. This is a deadly illusion. The U.S. imperialists, who are responsible for well over a century of mass murder and torture on a global scale, including the recent bloody wars and occupations in the Near East, are foursquare behind Israel as it commits atrocities against the Palestinians.

As Netanyahu’s freakout over the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran demonstrated, Israeli and American interests in the Near East do not always coincide. But the Zionist rulers know they can rely on bipartisan support from Washington. Those activists who hope against hope that the Democrats will some day do right by the Palestinians are oblivious to reality: historically, the Democrats have been even more fervent and bellicose than the Republicans in their support for Israel. After Obama’s Iran deal, Hillary Clinton assured wealthy Jewish donors that she would be a better friend to Israel than Obama has been. And while Bernie Sanders, touted as some kind of “socialist” by much of the fake left, recently intoned that the U.S. should play a more “even-handed” role in dealing with the Palestinians, he supported Israel’s blitzkrieg in Gaza last year and vows to continue military aid to the Zionist state. This is what pro-Palestinian activists can expect from the fraternal (i.e., not identical) twin parties of U.S. imperialism. No less misguided are the prevalent illusions in the United Nations, which is an instrument of the imperialist robber barons and butchers. Among its crimes, the UN presided over the Zionist partition in 1948 and set up the 1982 massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon.

After decades of betrayals by their leadership and interminable imperialist-brokered sham “peace talks,” today the Palestinian people are more isolated than ever. We seek to convince youth and workers who side with the Palestinians that a just, egalitarian world can be realized only through the overturn of the global capitalist order. This goal requires painstaking effort to build Marxist parties—forged in uncompromising struggle against all the political agents of capitalism and against every manifestation of oppression based on race, nation, religion or sex—and to win to such parties the advanced layers of the working class and the oppressed, not least in the American bastion of imperialist reaction. This is the task to which the International Communist League is dedicated. There is no other way. Down with Zionist terror! Down with U.S. imperialism! Reforge the Fourth International, world party of socialist revolution!

personalfinance,Better credit building technique?,"So until two years ago, I hadn't cared much about a credit score and avoided having credit cards, etc. My mom had terrible issues with credit card debt and it impacted the way I viewed credit. I believed it was a liability and would lead to misery and misuse as I had seen plenty of examples of friends and family with staggering credit card debt. It was a foolish decision because I'm incredibly responsible with my money and I could have started building credit so much sooner.

Either way, two years ago I decided to go and work on improving my credit history. I took a small secured loan with my bank to get a low interest rate and gave myself two years to repay (easy no risk payments of $25 a month). The interest is low because it's secured and I also make interest on the CoD so I think I'm only out $6 dollars or so over the life of the loan.

I also opened an account with Capital One for a secured credit card to slowly build my accounts. I couldn't qualify for any other credit cards because of my lack of credit history. Both credit lines are always repaid on time and I'm careful to keep spending on the credit card under 10% of the total limit, which has increased over time. 

Next month my bank loan is repaid in full. The question is, do I use my CoD to open another loan with the bank in order to add another account to my credit history or would I be better served with getting a different type of credit/financing? I don't entirely want to have another full credit check against my score because I've got 3 already (credit check from utilities, bank, CC) and the secured loans don't require anything but the collateral of my CoD with my bank. Do YOU know of a better/quicker/cheaper way to build credit?

I'm basically just looking for advice from people on strategies to continue building my credit score and stay debt free. I've got a good savings account, emergency savings, some stocks, bonds, and a mutual fund. I'm not desperately needing quick credit, just looking to keep building my score in as low cost and effective manner as possible. =)

Edit: I should note, I'm here in Oregon, USA if that makes a difference with anything.",finance,1447005305

personalfinance,Can we afford this house?,"So, my boyfriend and I (getting engaged soon) are thinking of buying a house. On paper, it seems like we can afford it, but since I have a history of getting really stressed out about large purchases, I'd like to lay the facts out and see what you lovely folks at /r/personalfinance think.

- The house costs $185k, and is in good condition with no immediate updates or repairs needed. The sellers have been described as ""very motivated."" Listing agent says they have to sell for at least 170k, and can be negotiated with, probably down to the low 170s.

- We want to put down 10% through an LPMI conventional program that offers a higher interest rate, but doesn't require MPI.

- My boyfriend has been individually pre-approved for 150k. With the two of us, I'm thinking it should be no problem to be approved for this amount. A pre-approval is currently in the works.

- Combined, we make ~100k annually.

- He has no debt. I have 13k in debt (9k auto loan, 3k student loan). I am considering selling my car and buying a cheaper one with cash.

- He has 10k in savings. I have 28k in savings. Our plan is that I would pay the down payment, escrow charges, and seller reimbursement charges (total 25k) and he would pay the closing charges (7k). This leaves us each with 3k in savings, and the ability to build that back up reasonably quickly.

- I am currently saving $1000 per month and he's saving $1500 per month.

- We currently pay $1100 a month in rent and ~$200 a month in electric. Other bills are covered by our apartment complex.

- [ETA] I have a 749 credit score and his is 718.

One thing you will notice is that I am not saving at all until the Navient loan is finished.  I figure I can use the CC's if I get into a pinch and I can get help for rent (luckily).

personalfinance,Searching for the lowest interest rate for a Student Loan,"Hi PF!

My girlfriend has recently enrolled into the Dental Hygiene program at Rutger's University and will need to take out a private student loan to cover the costs she will incur. For the first school year (Jan '16 - Dec '16) She received $9,500 in federal loans through FASFA but is still in need of an additional $20,500.

A little about the both of us - We are both 26 years old with credit scores of 760. She has 10k in her back account and I have 7k and we rent an apartment together, both filing our taxes independently.

So far, she has applied with (2) companies - Sallie Mae (no co-signer) and Sun Trust (I am the co-signer).

Results:
Sallie Mae - INCONCLUSIVE (see first bulletin under ""Questions"")

SunTrust 

- 7 Year Loan = Fixed Rate (7.459%) or Variable Rate (5.809%), Interest ONLY during school ($127.44/month for Fixed or ~$99 with Variable), Payment after graduation = $314.03/month or $297.61 with Variable option.

- 10 Year Loan = Fixed Rate (8.269%) or Variable Rate (6.279%), Interest ONLY during school ($141.28/month for Fixed or $107.28 with Variable), Payment after graduation = $251.66/month or $230.49 with Variable option.

Here are my questions:

- Sallie Mae will not give her an interest rate unless she signs the agreement. We both do not feel comfortable doing so for obvious reasons (interest rate is unknown). Has anyone else had this issue before?

- *Opinion* Variable or Fixed Interest rate? I tried to find the historical data for student loan variable interest rates over the past 10-15 years in an attempt to find the trend but was unable to find any conclusive reports. We're both leaning towards a Fixed Interest rate in fear the rate will increase higher than the fixed rate over the next 10 years.

- Can we get a better Fixed income rate with another loaner? We're limiting the # of applications we submit because each submission hits our credit report with a ""Hard Inquiry"".

- Generally, I thought you were given a lower interest rate the longer your loan term was but that is I have not found that to be true. My initial plan was to accept a 15 year loan (to receive a lower interest rate) and pay it off in under 10, if possible. Can someone confirm/deny this strategy?

I have a student loan in India for a principal amount of ~$18k. The interest rate is 14.75%, with a holiday period of 36 months during which I need not start the payback. The total repayment period is 90 months. I am 27 months in and will start paying back  from next month. I want to clear off the debt within 2 yrs, preferably sooner. (Avalanche Principle, sooner the better). This results in a minimum monthly payment of around $1220 over 2 yrs. 

I am exploring options to get a loan here in the US, clear my student loan in India while I repay here at a lower interest. Some points to consider:

* I have 2 credit cards which I've been using regularly and promptly paying off. A Discover card (21 months) and an Amex card (5 months) 

* No loans taken in the US so far. One vehicle financing could start in a month. 

* The currency exchange rate and transfer charges are about 1% (or less). There are no pre-closure charges on the loan.

I am yet to approach other banks about this. (the vehicle dealer also suggested that I have 3 lines of credit for cheaper financing options).

finance,Question regarding Fed rate hike,"I had a question about the Fed rate hike (if it happens). I have a little bit of economics knowledge but need some information about a likely scenario.

To my knowledge, the monetary system works like this. Basically the Fed buys bonds for cash - this is what ""creates"" money. Rates have been low and there have been a lot of bond repos so lots of money in the US economy. When rates rise, cash holders seeking safety put the money back into bonds making money a little more scarce. 

This is where things get a little crazy. If Fed raises rates, we should expect money from overseas to start pouring into dollar denominated assets since a lot of countries have lowered their interest rates in recent years. Would this undo the rise in rates since money from China, Europe, etc. is now back on our shores? In short, the total money supply would decrease but the actual money available to the US banking system would increase. Is this a correct reading of this? If so, what are the implications for lending like mortgages?",finance,1447060892
investing,US Dollar Movement,"After Friday's Impressive US employment report, the probability of a December FED rate hike has increased. The US Dollar reigns and we will follow the upward trend as long as there is no driver that could change the current status.

Explanation:

We are expecting the US Dollar to continue gaining ground. The US Non-Farm Employment change from last Friday came in better than economists expected. It showed that 271,000 more people were employed during the month of October, beating expectations of 181,000. The unemployment rate came in at expectations of 5%. This data has increased the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this December. Also, since we are not expecting any major data out for the remainder of the day, we do not see anything getting in the way of the US Dollar's momentum.

We also expect to see a depreciation in the Euro-US Dollar currency pair as there is a sharp divergence between the tones of both Central Banks. The European Central Bank is bearish on the Eurozone economy. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi stated multiple times last week that the door is still open for an increase in Monetary Easing policies during upcoming sessions. This is causing a strong movement of the EUR-USD to the downside.

personalfinance,Budget Review - Savings vs Debt Repayment,"Hello,

I have been reading this subreddit for a while and have learned a ton of valuable information from all of you. I’ve been questioning lately if I am handling my loans, saving, and retirement funds as well as I could be.  I currently have $22,500 in student loans  and I am paying this off with an income of $52k a year before tax. I currently pay $300 for student loans a month and try to contribute whatever extra money I can save. As for retirement savings, I contribute 6% to my 401k (up to company match) and contribute $423 a month to my Roth IRA to hit the max each year. I currently have $1000 saved up for an emergency fun and pay off my credit card each month. I have some questions overall I was hoping you all could help with. I included my full budget below if anyone is curious...

Budgeting - Monthly
Income Pre- Tax	$3,996
401k (6%) - $240  (50% match to 6%)
Roth IRA (Set to Max)	$423
Take Home Pay - $2,385
Rent	- $545 
Car Payment - $359 (3 years remaining)
Student Loans - $306 (detailed below)
Car Insurance - $115 
Gas - $20 
Spotify - $11 
Groceries - $100 
Car Gas - $120 
Free Spending - $809 

1)	Should I be funneling all of this money towards my Roth IRA over paying my student loans? Currently $13,250 of this has an interest rate of 6.55% while the remaining $9,250 is at 3.15%. Would I be better to cut of the Roth IRA contributions and knock out the loans at 6.55% as quick as possible? Secondly, both of these loans are going to a Vanguard Retirement 2055 Fund (I am 25 years old). Would you suggest a better alternative than putting both accounts in the same fund?

2)	A few friends have refinanced their loans through citizens or Sofi or citizens bank. Would this be worth researching given my situation? 

3)	What are some suggestions any of you may have  as to how I could tweak my savings/expense plan to start building towards a more secure financial future.

personalfinance,Saving while paying off debt?,"Hey guys, first time posting in r/pf, one of my favorite subs to lurk on.

Anyways, i have a question for you. I have a fair amount of student debt, and a fairly high income, and im wondering how to balance two of the personalfinance commandments:

1. Upon getting a job, Thou shalt payeth your debts as soon as humanly possible

2. Thou shalt saveth an emergency fund equal to 3-6 months of your expenses.

I'm trying to do both but want to get different opinions on what your strategies would be in my situation. 

My info:

27 yo male working in sillicon valley (at job for 2 years)

114k/year plus bonuses (20%)

6% goes to 401k (about 28k in there total, but not fully vested yet - company match fully vested in 2 more years at job)

Take home = 6k per month

Student loan = $80k (was over 100k before job) Edit: consolodated all loans at variable interest rate currently at 3.4%

Car loan = $12k (was 22k at purchase)
Edit: 0.9% apr

I also paid off several other small loans/credit card debts over the last 2 years, so only the two loans above are left.

Savings = $9k (with a $20-30k goal, at which point i will stop saving and put everything towards loans). 

Monthly loan payment = $1500 (could be higher, but thats the money im saving).
Car payment = $350

Savings goal per month = $1000 (until emergency fund goal is met)

So i guess im asking if PF thinks i should be paying down loans faster and not worrying about the emergency fund, saving more, or just keep doing what im doing. I feel that my job is fairly secure, but i also feel that i got very lucky getting this job and worry that if i was layed off i would have a hard time finding another job that pays as well - hance the emergency fund goal.

personalfinance,Emergency fund question: Teacher edition,"I feel like most emergency fund recommendations are geared towards people in a different situation than my family is in. I've been wondering about this for a while, hopefully you guys can clear it up for me, or even tell me I'm on the right track. 

My husband is a teacher, getting paid 12 time a year, on a Sept 30-August 31 schedule. He is doing well at his job, which is a continuing contract (meaning, he has a job for next year, unless something extraordinary happens), there is a teacher shortage in our state, and is in a position to be tenured in 2017.

As far as emergency funds go, what is necessary in this situation? Since we still have quite a bit of credit card debt ($5000), my current goal is to have enough in our savings account to cover 1 month of bills, not including food, which for us is $1755. 

Once I have that $1755 saved (we currently put $125 a month towards this and I estimate we'll have this amount saved by July 2016-- it is highly unlikely he will lose his job before then), my plan is to put in less each month, with a new goal of $3400. I have separate accounts for medical emergencies, car maintenance, and our child's savings account, which all get fed monthly.

personalfinance,"$50 in checking account, $700 in credit card debt, $22,500 in student loans. Where to start?","Recent University grad here. Just moved back home after working a summer internship then traveling during Sept &amp; Oct. Blew all of my savings on the trip, don’t have a (real) job lined up, and my grace period on a large chunk of my student loans is set to end tomorrow. So today marks the day I start chipping away at my irresponsibility. Was hoping for some advice on how to prioritize/allocate my debt repayment and just generally how I should start saving for a happy/healthy/(hopefully) not shitty future. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s the rundown of my financial situation:

-       $50 in my checking account
-	I owe $683.24 on my credit card
-	Owe my parents $700 for the trip (5% interest starts accruing 11/2016)
-	I have $22,500 in federal student loans. My Stafford Loan grace period ends 11/10/15 but I don’t have to make my first payment until 1/09/2016. My Perkins Loan grace period ends in March. 
-	I have a check for $4,500 coming in the next 4 weeks for property I reclaimed form the state (relatives gifted me stock when I was born, parents forgot about the account, it got transferred to the state then liquidated after the account was dormant)

&amp;nbsp;

The loans are broken out as follows:

-	Stafford Unsubsidized Loan: $2,000 @ 6.8% w/ $546 in interest
-	Stafford Unsubsidized Loan: $2,000 @ 3.86% w/ $156 in interest
-	Stafford Subsidized Loan: $3,500 @ 3.4% w/ $0.00 in interest
-	Stafford Subsidized Loan: $4,500 @ 3.4% w/ $76.00 in interest
-	Stafford Subsidized Loan: $5,500 @ 3.86% w/ $106 in interest
-	Federal Perkins Loan: $5,000 @ 5% w/ $0.00 in interest
-	(all interest rates are fixed)

&amp;nbsp;

I’m really fortunate in that my parents are letting me live at home for free for the next few months. So no rent, food, or utilities costs. I’ve picked up some seasonal employment while searching/applying for jobs relating to my major. Should be working about 25-30 hours a week @ $11.50/hr (before taxes). I’m doing some odd jobs for family @ $15/hour (cash) and should pick up another 5-10 hours doing that for the next month.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t currently have an emergency fund in place, so I was thinking my order of operations is to first knock out my credit card debt in the next few weeks, then start putting money into an emergency fund and tackling my Stafford loans. But here’s where I need some help. 

&amp;nbsp;

-	Which loans should I tackle first? Any advice on types of repayment plans? The Unsubsidized 6.8% loan is hitting hard with the $546 in interest, so I’m thinking of trying to pay that down  as much as I can while paying minimum amounts on the other loans
-	Should I pay off a huge chunk of my student loans with the $4,500 I’m getting back from the state? Or reinvest it as savings elsewhere?
- I'm doing all of this with the hope that I'll have a job in my field (Marketing) by late January/early February. I'm hoping to move out at that point (to major US city), so I'm trying to take advantage of my minimal living expenses while I can. I'll need to save up money for first months rent (looking to sublet from a friend), cause I doubt I'll get any sort of relocation/signing bonus from the types of companies I'm applying to. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm definitely fortunate with my living situation and the fact that I have a seemingly manageable amount of student debt, but I want to take the steps to stop being an idiot with my money (and get out of my parents basement). Any and all advice or helpful links would be much appreciated.  Thanks so much.",finance,1447100867

personalfinance,MangoMoney have lost my savings. Please help.,"As you probably know, MangoMoney offers quite attractive interest rate on their savings (5%), so I decided to take my chances. I opened account there for myself and my wife. To have that APY, MangoMoney required direct deposit to be set up. So I did that. But since I'm the only one who is employed, the direct deposit to my wife's account was from my salary. 

So far so good. Within next 6 month I was happily watching how my money ""works"". Then MangoMoney had some reorganization. As far as I understood, the system was transferred from one bank to another. Migration procedure seemed to be quite simple and I migrated my account without any issues. 

Then I tried to do it for my wife's account and here the fun part starts. The migration failed with no apparent reason. We contacted customer service, but they didn't have any good explanation for that. So they recommended us to wait for the check that bank supposed to issue for those who decided not to migrate. That sounded reasonable and we waited. Month passed after the service discontinuation, but I haven't received the check. 

I called them again to ask about ETA, but they told me completely different story - my wife's account was closed on September, because direct deposit was not on my wife's name, but on my name. Also they told me that they sent all the money (including 5K of savings that was transferred there from my wife's another account) to ""originating source"", that is my employer.

I contacted my payroll department and they told me that they have not received any notification about that. They advised me to get as much details as possible from the bank. Particularly they told me to figure out the transfer tracking number and wire confirmation number.

I contacted MangoMoney customer service again, explained them what I need, but they refused to provide me any information saying that my wife's account is already closed and they can't help me.

From my perspective it looks like a fraud, because they never contacted my wife about the issues with her account and they have done the transfer without her permission. And I'm not even sure that they have done that transfer because they refuse to provide me with the transfer tracking number. So it looks like they just lost/stolen my money.

Could you please tell me what I can do to get my money back? 

**UPD:** I figured out that the problem was in the very first 5K deposit. Allegedly they couldn't confirm that the transfer is legit. My wife have not received neither any calls from them nor emails. Moreover, when she called to the customer service regarding the transfer they didn't mention that anything was wrong. 

Now they suggest me to ask originating bank for a transaction reversal. And according to them that's the only way I can get my money back. But to me it doesn't make sense: the transaction successfully went through and it's final. Besides they already closed my account. How could the reversal be possible in this case?",finance,1447105473

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation,"Looking to minimize the interest paid on my student loans so I can make some traction on them. After doing some research it seems like the best option for me is to consolidate my federal and private loans together because my personal situation will not allow me to qualify for any federal loan forgiveness programs. Additionally, due to my good credit history/score/salary, I believe I will qualify for an interest rate on a consolidated loan that is better than any of the interest rates on the individual loans I have now. I start a job next week that will allow me to pay my total student loan debt off in 1 year and I am trying to determine whether to select a variable rate, which is lower in the beginning, than a fixed rate that is marginally higher. For example, I looked into LendKey and their options are as follows: 4.5% fixed rate for 15 year span, 3.25% fixed rate for 5 year span, and as low as 1.90% variable rate for either 5/10/15 year span. Since I plan to pay them off in one year I am wondering if the variable rate is the way to go. Any insight you all could provide would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"Owe $300k on back taxes, penalties &amp; interest. Need some advice!","Several years ago I took over full ownership of a failing business at a time when I was also pretty financially irresponsible and had a lot of personal debt. Long story short, we worked our way out of the personal debt and built the business back up but the first few years were hard and we got behind on filing and paying taxes. The first few years when the business wasn't making much money I honestly didn't think we'd owe - we reinvested everything back into the business. But what I wasn't considering was we were buying lots of inventory and starting from scratch and that's not deducted until it's sold. So long story short, a few years later I had a rude awakening!

As the years passed it just snowballed and the stress and anxiety of it nearly drove me to alcoholism and depression. I finally bit the bullet and went to a tax accountant, and they helped me get everything together and file. They reconstructed our Quickbooks from scratch and even though they made a ton of mistakes, they filed our taxes for us. But they wanted a small fortune to keep working on our case, and so we dropped them and went another couple of years without filing or paying. Then I put a 2nd accounting firm on retainer and did another POA and then never heard back from them. Ever. Literally money down the drain. And a lot more time. 

Fast forward to a little over a year ago... Our business continues to grow and I knew I had to get this resolved or it was going to put me in the hospital or bankrupt me (or both). On the recommendation of a friend who used them before (for back tax issues), I called one of the biggest baddest accounting / law firms in the big metro city near us and put them on retainer to help me resolve the issue. 

They helped us get current on filing and we have been paying estimated taxes, but the back taxes, penalties, and interest amount to just over $300,000 and are growing pretty rapidly with interest and penalties racking up constantly. Now I'm $25k in to this law firm in fees (though some of those include preparing and filing last year's taxes and a few small things) but they're telling me pretty much suck it up and pay... that I'm going to end up paying everything and there's really no negotiating or anything. (side note, now I kind of wish I had just sent $20k to the IRS and paid a local accountant to do our taxes)

We make good money. This year we'll probably have taxable income of about $250k but between all the taxes (federal, state, ss, medicare, etc) we pay about 33% effective tax. From what I've found researching IF the IRS puts us on a payment plan it will be for a maximum of 6 years, and that would bring our payment to over $4k a month. We don't live very extravagantly but that would force us to sell our house and move into a MUCH smaller home, sell the cars, etc. to try to make that payment. We spend just over $10k a month right now on the basics (home, insurances, cars, food, utilities, etc). I could cancel DirecTV and satellite radio but that kind of stuff really doesn't cost much at all. 

So my question -- is there any way to work out a deal to reduce or abate some of the penalties? I've read they don't ever do anything about the interest... our penalties + interest together are close to $100k of the $300k. If we could even get $50k of that abated I think that would make a big difference. I'm just looking for ideas to research, experiences others have had, things to ask my attorneys, etc.

*I want to pay the taxes we owe*, but I'm afraid when we finally hear from the IRS they're going to want more than we can afford and they could easily force us into bankruptcy. There's no way we could sell our home quickly, so if we were forced to pay a huge payment to the IRS we'd have to just not pay something else (our mortgage) and we'd end up eventually foreclosing and possibly filing bankruptcy.

So I'm curious what other options are out there. There's no way I can get a $300k loan, we don't have that much equity in our home, and I don't have a substantial amount of savings. I *can* increase our income by about $30-50k a year by adding some consulting revenue and I can continue to grow our business... and I plan on putting every dime available toward getting the debts paid as fast as possible.

Any advice would be appreciated.  Again, not looking for legal advice - just some ideas we can research, experiences others have had, etc. Thanks!

All of the doctors my family sees are covered by both, and the high deductible option is mathematically the best choice.

GEHA will open a health savings account (HSA) on HSABank, and they will contribute a total of $1,500 on my behalf as part of the premium pass-through. That leaves my family $5,150 we can contribute.

personalfinance,Not saving while paying off debt -- Does the length of time that I am solely focused on paying off the debt become a consideration?,"I graduated law school with ~$180k in combined grad and undergrad loans.  I have about $10k in savings as an emergency fund.  My salary is about $90k and I will receive lockstep raises of between 8% to 12%.  My wife earns a salary of $45k.  All together we take home about $6k per month.  We live in a fairly high COL area, and although we do not live like paupers, we do minimize our living expenses. 

I'm currently paying between $2100 and $2500 per month using the avalanche method.  My wife and I have paid off a good amount of debt over the last year and we will be completely focusing on the student loans shortly, so the amount paid each month towards the loans will increase.  So for purposes of this post, let's assume that I am paying ~$3000 per month for the duration of the loans.  Under the avalanche method, the loans will be paid off by December 2021 (although I imagine it will be sooner as my salary increases and as I throw additional payments at the principal). 

My concern is that during that time I am not building up any retirement savings (or even saving for a down payment on a house, but that is a secondary concern).  I understand that I am getting a guaranteed return equal to the interest rate of the debt that I am paying off, but at the same time I worry that I am missing out on five to six years of compounding growth in a retirement account.  I am also concerned that it is not something that I can really catch up with once my debt is paid off given the $5,500 limit on the IRA.  

My employer does not match any 401k contributions so I do not participate in the retirement plan.  I currently have a Roth IRA with only $3,000 but I have stopped contributing to it in the interest of paying off my student loans as fast as possible.  

So, I've read the side bar, searched, etc., and the general consensus, which I am following, is that the debt should be paid off first.  I just want to confirm that the long-term payment of a debt does not change the equation at all such that I should be making some sort of contribution to my Roth IRA.

investing,Rental Property vs Dividend Stocks,"This is a long post - hope you have the patience to read through it! 

I had a duplex rental for 1.5 years and chose to sell it. I would like you guys to see my logic as to why I chose to have dividend earning stocks vs rental income. Please find any loopholes you can, or take it as a learning opportunity. Please note, the tax rules I am using are for Canada so I'm sure it will not apply everywhere.

Paid 340k for a duplex. Rent was 1150 for a two bedroom and 1250 for a three bedroom. Plus utilities for both apartments. Had probably the best tenants I could ask for but I've learnt something. Regardless of they are good or not, renters are renters. They expected everything to be fixed immediately. (Example: lock didn't want to turned at 2am which apparently had been an on going issue for 2 months yet they never told me, I wanted to lubricate and let it sit in the morning, they demanded I call a lock smith immediately. Me not calling one caused them to despise me a little). Things would get me worked up easily after that but I had to keep a happy face with them. 

Expenses: approx 850 (interest portion of 1200 a month mortgage) + 310 (prop tax) + 110 (insurance). That works to 1270 and rent brought a total of 2400 before tax. That's 1130 per month profit! Seems ridiculously good doesn't it? Well maybe to an outsider.

Now a few costs not mentioned here with buying a rental is: land transfer (mine was 3575), bank mortgage fee (700 - but this would be paid to borrow either way), lawyer (2000), house inspection (560). This does NOT include selling costs which would include lawyer + realtor fee (unless you sell private) and potential IRD bank penalty if you sell within a mortgage term (this one cost me 6k!).

It was consuming me, I work between 50-60 hours a week at my job, make good money as it is, then on top of that had to worry about the rental - even when nothing was going wrong.

I figured I'd compare it to dividend paying stocks (and ignoring any capital gain). The assumption would be no major repairs were made and my tenants did not ever leave with it being empty for one month and with the stocks side that the company did not cancel out a dividend payment. So I compared it to borrowing the same amount of money from the bank at the same rate and place it in dividend paying stocks. I designed a solid blue chip portfolio that paid approx 4% which would be approx 1133 per month (taxed at only 8% so long as I invest in Canadian companies vs rent which was 32%). The expense here would be interest of approx 850 per month only (which is claimed and returns approx 32% at income tax time).

The only fees with dividend stocks would be the commission cost, which generally is 10 to buy, 10 to sell. To diversify I bought 22 companies so the purchase price was 220. Generally, to set up a HELOC there would be a 700 dollar fee just as a mortgage, but there was a promo so I didn't have to pay it.

The tax breakdown: 

In Canada, dividend paid by a Canadian Corporation at my tax bracket is taxed at 8%, whereas income (rent) is taxed as 32%.

Rental: 
(income - expenses) * (100% - income tax rate) 
(2400 - 1270) * (100% - 32%) = leaving me with 768.40 per month 

Dividend Stocks (yield 4%): 
(dividend * (100% - div_tax_rate)) - (expenses * (100% - income tax rate)) 
(1133 * (100% - 8%)) - (850 * (100% - 32%)) = 464.66 per month 

Difference 
768.40 - 464.66 = 303.74
193.54 * 12 months = 3644.88 (or 1% annually on 340k)

I felt like the difference in ""income"" was worth it, considering my stocks don't call me (yet!). Both housing market and stock market can crash, so I ignored that fact for now, but kept it in the back of my mind. I also do believe that housing price does fluctuate just as much as stocks do, only you can't login to a website and see the price change second by second. This brings me to a benefit of stocks - liquidity. The shingles on my rental would have to be replaced in 2 years, which would be another upcoming cost (at least this one is planned!).

I sold my rental for 390k making a profit - so I can't say I regret my decision. I ended up getting a 150k line of credit (HELOC) locked in for 4 years at the same rate of mortgage interest rates to buy stocks. I know I keep mentioning borrowing the same amount - but that was for simplicity of comparing. I felt like borrowing less at the start was a good way to do it, then perhaps borrow more at a later date.

Hope you find my logic helpful, if not tell me why. Please note I am not a professional by any means, this is simply my opinion (and I hope no one points out issues in my math!)",finance,1447169548

electronics,Reminder: AliExpress Singles Day (11/11) sale is tomorrow (&lt;24 hours from now),"http://www.aliexpress.com/

Tomorrow is ""Singles Day"":  A completely made-up shopping holiday invented by Alibaba.  It's like China's version of Black Friday except it only applies to Alibaba.com and AliExpress.com.  The latter of which is what you should concern yourself with because they have a zillion suppliers of cheap electronics components and they're all going to have *actually-decent sales*!

Last year I was able to pick up two 5-meter rolls of 60LEDs/meter APA-102 LED light strips (IP67 waterproof!) and a roll of WS2812s (aka Neopixels) *super cheap*.  I got the APA-102s for about $100 (shipped) which is just about $10/meter for the best RGB LED strip technology in existence right now.  That's about 50% of the normal price *today* but it was actually about 75% off last year.

Here's some tips for shopping at AliExpress:  Make sure you select ""ePacket Delivery"" or FedEx/DHL or don't buy it!  ePacket is the best because it's usually free or super cheap (e.g. $2 for two big 5M rolls of LEDs) and it *includes a tracking number*.  No tracking number == No buy.  Get that in your head right now:  If there's no tracking the supplier will put you at the tail end of their shipment priorities which means you might not get what you ordered *until next year*.  Yes, they can be that slow!

Also note that ePacket can take *a month* or so.  Especially for orders on Singles Day.  So if you need your item sooner than that make sure to select a supplier offering reasonably-priced FedEx/DHL shipping.  If you already added something to your shopping cart and at checkout you see that the supplier has *ridiculous prices* on FedEx/DHL just look for another supplier or even another option in that same supplier's shop.  They will usually have packages with discounted FedEx/DHL shipping options.

Alternatively:  Just contact the supplier!  They'll have broken English but they know damn well what, ""FedEx/DHL shipping too expensive!  I need this by December 1st.  What can you offer me?"" means.  They are also usually *more* than happy to oblige if you say things like, ""I will recommend you to all my friends/business contacts if you do this."" =D

Other tips:

* The ""$50 for a $100 gift card"" offers are worth every penny!  Buy your budget's worth!
* The time-based sales are full of absolute *crap*.  Don't bother.  Just leisurely peruse the search engine's results any time of the day.  There's not going to be great ""lightning deals"" (or whatever they're called) on, say, relay boards, lasers, or LED light strips.
* Suppliers that focus on one particular type of component (e.g. they sell LEDs and nothing else) will usually have the best deals.",technology,1447171227

Bitcoin,"""Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers."" - Hal Finney Dec. 2010.","Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. **Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient.** Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.

Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.

George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.

I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the ""high-powered money"" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. **Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.**

gaming,"I'm 100% Fed up with todays ""Gaming"". Games arn't made for Gamers anymore, they're hype generated broken on release day money sinks.","Almost every AAA Title released over the past two years have been released unfinished, DLC riddled, bug infested and overall bland in comparison to thier predecessor.

Then we've got games like Xenoblade that are actually made with gamers in mind that will and have been overlooked and not be purchased by 90% of the gaming community because it's stuck on an honestly terribly marketed system with zero HYPE.

Indie games are becoming very common, and rightly so. Gamers are FED UP with these companies and if they want a FUN game they'll be playing these indie games. Yet you've got big companies like Square Enix trying to cash in on the indie scene, and overall the quality of these games are dropping dramatically as well as they ARE a huge source of income as well.

Money&gt;all. I get that, we all do. Yet Don't tell me there wasnt a time in our life when we could go to the store and pick up a game without worrying that one, it might need a day 1 patch of 20GB, 2 that it might literally just not work out of the box, and 3 it might require a dozen bucks or so of DLC to get the full experience.

Remember playing tony hawk pro skater? Remember doing those epic achievments and unlocking a new skater or stage?

Now immagine doing that today, instead of doing that epic stunt over the two skyscrapers to unlock the skater, you simply have to buy the ""skater pack"" for 14.99 which includes 3 skaters with stats higher than any of the free to unlock skaters! This is after loosing your save file to a bug 20 hours in and starting over, and waiting a few hours for your day 1 patch to download if you're unfortunate enough to not have great DL speeds. and dealing with poor framerate drops during critical moments in your tricks.

Yea this is basically todays gaming. Yet nobody is going to stop preordering and buying off pure HYPE and AAA title names.

Nobody is going to say ""Hey, I should probably read a review first."" Before dishing out 65 bucks to be a cool kid.

Let us all enjoy the future of gaming as it quickly dies, Nintendo being the only gaming company releasing not broken games simply because they're the natzis of quality control yet sorely outdated and killing any 3rd party support at the same time.

Uhg, truth is we have as little control over fixing todays gaming issues as we do with who becomes president of the USA. Yet atleast we can TRY to vote, and HOPE it does something or atleast shows in the numbers that we are tired of this shit.

Great, right?

Except I didn't stick with medical bills only and I haven't kept up with paying off all the other stuff and the monthly medical bill payment. I'm 30 years old and up to this point have NEVER carried a balance on a credit card - always paid it off the same month.

So now the 12 months has expired, I have $2700 left on the card and a 14.99% interest rate. I have been comfortably paying $400/month so far to ""chip away at it"" but really can't do more than that. I have $6000 in an emergency savings account and no other assets. So do I keep paying the $400/mo, put the card in freezer so I can't use it, and pay $25-30 interest monthly OR should I just dip into my emergency fund and pay it off (which I should have done last year instead of getting another credit card because apparently I can't handle it)?

The only debt that we have is a car loan. Over the last year we managed to save quite a bit of money, not enough for the down payment, but enough to pay off the car. With the interest rates so low, there is really no good way to invest these savings safely. CDs are way below 1% and stocks and mutual funds are too risky for the short term. We think we could have the down payment within the next three to five years.   

Now, I read somewhere on this subreddit that paying off a loan is basically investing the money with the interest rate that you are currently paying for the duration of the loan (You are paying yourself and you are saving the interest). And I can totally understand it, however I think my two goals are at odds. Let’s say we want to save 50k for a house.  

1.	If I pay off the car I will have less money for a down payment and have to save longer to reach my 50k. During that time interest rates might rise. In fact interest rates are already rising and the real estate market is picking up. It will take longer to get into our house.  

2.	I do not pay off the car and save until I reach my goal. Now if I go to the bank, they will see my car loan and they will tell me that I they will only lend me so much because of the car. We will have a smaller house.

personalfinance,"Auto dealer not reporting my car loan. (CA,USA)","Hi all, 

I am new to america ( having lived in Australia for the past 30 years) and upon arriving I found out the hard way that the credit systems are completely unlinked ( in Australia I have a mortgage (infact I still own the house), owned multiple cars, had credit cards with 5 digit limits, etc. ) 

After moving to California I started to run into a fair few issues not having a credit rating, ( mostly signing up for utilities ), and when that is combined with the fact that I would like to purchase a house here in the next 12 to 24 months I thought it would be prudent to start to build some credit. 

According to my research it appears that the best way to do so is to organize a secured credit card, and then a car loan. 

So I organized a secured credit card. 

We also needed a second car, so I went hunting, knowing that I had enough cash on hand to purchase one outright I ended up deciding to attempt to go a loan so I had 2 lines of credit building up my rating as opposed to 1. I find a dodgy looking car yard with a car which fit my particular needs ( 7+ seats, under $5000)  I end up putting down $2k as a deposit, and having a car loan for the remaining $2000, ( 12 months @ an predatory interest rate, but I didn't care at the time since I have enough cash in my account to pay the loan out in one hit if I need to, _AND_ im building a credit rating. )

so approximately 3 months have passed. I decide to signup for credit karma and see if I have a credit score as of yet. I have a score of 633, ain't bad for 3 months of 90% utilization and then paying in full by the due date. ( could be 695 but I use the secured credit card for purchases on the WiiU and Xbox, im not fussed about running a high balance except for the month since I know that it will take a month to have no effect on my actual score anymore. 

One thing that I did find missing from the score was the car loan, the big selling point for me was the fact that it would get reported, infact I would have simply bought the car outright if I didnt think my credit score would have gained from it.

Any advice? is the loan itself required to be reported? Can I 'self report' the loan or force the car yard to report it ( without any repercussions ? )",finance,1447198105
investing,REM - a possible triple-bottom at support with a 14.8% yield,"The question for REM, the iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF, is it at a triple-bottom support or on a pause in an obvious down trend before a plummet into oblivion?

But the real question may be — is the technically over-sold condition in REM a sign that all the bad news from the Federal Reserve’s upcoming anticipated interest-rate hike already in the stock?  Hard to tell, it is already down eight percent for the year.  That may be enough.

The stock, which closed today at $9.91, has a yearly range from $12.69 to $9.76.

The triple-bottom at $9.76 is only a possibility since it always takes a confirming rally to complete the technical formation.  That clearly has not happened…yet.

Almost needless to say, the ETF’s current 14.83 yield (as of Oct 31, according to Yahoo Finance) is compelling.

And, at this point the good news for traders, and for long-term investors who refuse to look at red ink each day no matter what the yield, is the stop loss, if the down trend is bound to continue, is nearby.  Quite frankly I, for one, do not want to be here if this possible triple-bottom at 9.75 gets taken out (after all this could also be, technically speaking, a massive descending triangle with lots of downside left…gulp!).

The exact terms have yet to be determined, but 3% was mentioned in initial discussions. 

Here are the current balances for the loans:
$6,383 - Subsidized /
$4,634 - Subsidized /
$6,278 - Unsubsidized /
$7,310 - Unsubsidized /

All loans are currently in repayment on the Level payment plan, and getting a 0.25% interest rate discount for enrolling in direct debit. 

My relationship with my parents is good and I have no question that they'd give me a break if I encountered financial hardship.  This would also be a way to help them out as apparently a 3% is a better return for them than some other investment options they've been investigating. (Although it's possible that they are just spinning it that way to make me feel better about taking their assistance.) 

This seems like a no-brainer to me. Am I missing something?  What other factors should I take into consideration when deciding if I should do this?  

I also wonder about tax implications for both me and my parents. I should be able to continue to take the student loan interest deduction on my taxes as I still have several other students loans with the federal government, so I think I'm ok on my end.

personalfinance,Hidden dangers of refinancing student loans?,"Hi reddit- struggling graduate student here.

I recently received a letter from DRB stating that ""in view of your excellent credit record you're pre-qualified for this student loan refinancing offer"".... which is of course the typical marketing ploy used by banks when making offers. As much as I scoff and roll my eyes at these things, it did get me thinking about these student loans and if refinancing/consolidating would be a good option.


Background on these loans:

I have federal loans from my undergraduate institution, totaling about $55,000 (though it has grown some with interest I'm sure). I graduated December 2013 and have both subsidized and unsubsized loans. I also have two parent plus loans and one small private loan with Wells Fargo wrapped into that $55,000. The interest rate for the federal loans is 3.86% and the parent plus loans/private loan have an interest rate of 6.41%.


This is accompanied by my graduate loans for my two year Masters of Bioscience program. These loans are Graduate Plus loans and Graduate Unsubsidized loans that will add up to approximately $120,000. The interest rate on these loans is 6.7%. I graduate from this program May 2016 and will then begin repaying what will be close to $180,000.


The offer from DRB claims that I could have either a `1.90% APR variable or a 3.50% APR fixed at the lowest. I do understand this is ""conditional"" and only if I qualify. BUT saying that I did qualify for these lower rates.... what is the harm in refinancing? I know something has to be too good to be true.. I just can't figure out what.

What happens to repayment timelines or loan forgiveness programs or any of the like if I refinance to a private bank and not the federal government?

TLDR; What are the downsides to refinancing your student loans through a private company such as the one described above?

finance,"What do these words mean - buying curve flatteners, curve steepeners","So I was reading some rates strategy outlook commentary and was totally lost. Here is what I read:

&gt;We think the Fed is unlikely to wait very long to raise rates a 2nd time after their first rate hike in December, and will continue reinvestments throughout 2016, preventing a repricing higher of term premia.

&gt; We recommend entering UST 5/30 flattener at 137 bp, targeting 110 bp, stop at 140 p; EDH6/EDH7 steepeners also recommended

So, a few questions.

I guess the phrase *will continue reinvestments* is referring to the Fed reinvesting the principal of their Treasury securities as they mature. One of their exit strategies is to, eventually, not roll them over, and instead take the money out of the money supply. But I guess they are saying they think they will instead keep reinvesting at least for now, thus not tapering as much as they could.

Ok, fine. But, what the heck does ""preventing a repricing higher of term premia"" mean???

And the rest of it, I guess they are somehow talking about the yield difference between 30 year UST and 5 year UST, but I don't get what they are saying about it. And I have no idea what EDH is.

I joined the Army out of getting out of student loan debt, and with these last 2 years on my 6 year contract I will be gearing up to prepare for a better lifestyle and stronger gains for retirement.

Here is my current situation:

Was 45k in student loan debt (Currently at 4.5K remainder on federal student loans at 5.75% capped interest rate: hoping to pay this off at $500 per month plus remainder when I get my emergency fund surplus cash to use)

Currently make E-4 pay with COLA and BAS: average 2.4k a month after taxes.

Investing $210 dollars per month into TSP(thrift savings plan, diversified)(= 10% income per year)=Currently around 11k current estimate in fund.

10K=ICMARC Roth IRA fund

Own my car, no debt on it with worth of 10.3K

After student loans are paid off, I plan on taking that $500 and investing into a Vanguard fund for retirement.

Reading blogs on Mr. Money Mustache and Dave Ramsay for financial information.  Still very green on understanding the 4% safe withdrawal rule for retirement.

Next job I am looking at (with my degrees and duel Japanese/Korean language skills) I am not sure yet, but I will like to make more than my meager pay in the Army.

personalfinance,Can I get a little advice for using my bonus? I have three ideas and would like the pros and cons for each (UK).,"Hi r/personalfinance,

Looking for a bit of advice on using my £5,000 pre-tax bonus which is due to be paid out at the end of the month. I have drawn up my options but, as is only human, I am questioning my logic and would appreciate some advice for a UK redditor. I'm using a throwaway as some of this information is pretty personal.

At the moment the only debt I have is a mortgage, of which I pay £990 per month with ~£175,000 left on a fixed rate of 4.45%. I have four years remaining on this fixed rate (into my second year of a five year fix) and overpay 20% each month, effectively reducing the term from 25 years to 19 years.

My current pension scheme is pretty good in that I pay 6% of my pensionable salary each month and my employer matches it to 16%, giving a total of 22%. These payments are tax-free to pay in and you get 25% tax-free lump sum when you start taking your pension. As an aside I am thinking of changing my current pension investment strategy from the current “Scottish Widows Adventurous Solution Fund” from Aberdeen Asset Management to a handful of index funds. 

 I have no credit card/car/student debt and my emergency fund is set up. I’m also confident that my expenses are controlled. Also I'm in the 40% UK tax band.

 I see my options as follows:

* 1) Pay the entirety into my pension tax-free. I have been doing this with my previous bonuses and seems like the safe bet.

* 2) Take the bonus as cash, pay the tax, then pay the early repayment charge on my mortgage which is £6,000 and then remortgage with a lower interest rate. This would involve me dipping slightly into some spare cash I have in my current account but not touch my emergency fund. The benefits I can see with this is that the current two year interest rates are between 1.7% and 2.2%. With this I can either reduce my mortgage payments and invest in an index fund for medium term expenditure (e.g. house move, if I decide to have children, wedding, etc.), or I could pay the same monthly payment towards this new mortgage but be mortgage-free in 17 years rather than 19.

* 3) Take the bonus as cash and invest in an index tracking fund.

They all have their pros and cons but I am swaying towards the remortgaging option. In addition, some advice on the pension strategy would be useful.

This study estimated the health burden caused by leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that is transmitted by rats, livestock and other animals in environments that lack basic sanitation. We found that leptospirosis accounts for one million cases and 60,000 deaths each year, most of which occur in regions where its impact on subsistence farmers, pastoralists and slum dwellers has been “neglected”. Furthermore, the burden of leptospirosis is projected to rise as the global expansion of shantytowns and climate change-associated extreme weather events create the environmental conditions for intensified transmission.

We invite you to ask questions about leptospirosis, and how changes in the world’s demographics and environment are creating new health challenges and neglected diseases which impart their greatest impact on vulnerable populations.

investing,How Will The Fed Raise Rates?,"When the Fed finally decides to raise rates, we'll likely see it continue to set a target range for rates. That is, the Fed will likely move its target from 0-0.25% to 0.25-0.5%. After all, there will be some price discrepancy in the range, due to the aforementioned inefficiencies in the price targeting mechanism. Importantly, it will announce a change in the ""Fed Funds Target Rate"", but what it will really be changing is the Interest on Excess Reserves as well as the Reverse Repo Facility. The changes in these rates will help set a target rate for reserves via arbitrage by essentially eliminating the desire to lend at a rate lower than what the Fed is willing to pay.",finance,1447249942

I am currently a contractor and don't have an IRA. It seems like an obvious win to sign up and start putting money in but wondering what the cons are. Thanks all! 

--------------

U.S. Treasury Department Office of Public Affairs FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: November 4, 2015 Treasury Public Affairs, (202) 622-2960 U.S. TREASURY LAUNCHES myRA (my Retirement Account) TO HELP BRIDGE AMERICA’S RETIREMENT SAVINGS GAP With pilot concluded, program expands with new funding options to make myRA available to more people WASHINGTON– With millions of Americans lacking adequate retirement savings, the U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the national launch of myRA, a simple, safe and affordable new savings option for those who don’t have access to a retirement savings plan at work. People can get information about myRA and sign up for an account at myRA.gov. “myRA is designed to remove common barriers to saving, and give people an easy way to get started,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. “myRA has no fees, no risk of losing money and no minimum balance or contribution requirements. To make saving easier than ever, you can now put savings into my myRA RA directly from your bank account.” With the initial pilot phase of the program concluded, myRA is now available nationwide with multiple ways for people to start saving: Paycheck. Set up automatic direct deposit contributions to myRA through an employer. NEW: Checking or savings account. Now savers can fund a myRA account directly by setting up recurring or one-time contributions from a checking or savings account. NEW: Federal tax refund. At tax time, direct all or a portion of a federal tax refund to myRA.
“myRA can give people confidence that they’re taking steps in the right direction, and it can serve as a bridge to other savings options that will carry them the rest of the way,” said Lew. “myRA alone will not solve the nation’s retirement savings gap, but it will be an important stepping stone for encouraging and creating a nation of savers.” According to a 2015 Federal Reserve Report, 31 percent of non-retired people said they have no retirement savings or pension whatsoever. Additionally, a 2013 report by the National Institute on Retirement Savings found that the average near-retirement household had only $12,000 in retirement savings. Among workers who do not participate in a 401(k) or other defined contribution plan, 42 percent say it’s because their employer does not offer one. Furthermore, among part-time workers, a 2015 BLS Economic Release found that 62 percent don’t have access to a retirement plan at work. In his 2014 State of the Union address, President Obama announced that he would direct the Treasury Department to develop myRA. Throughout 2014, the Treasury Department developed the framework for the program, including creating a new Treasury savings bond to serve as the underlying investment for these accounts, as well as designating a financial agent to help Treasury administer the accounts and set up a simple way for savers to fund their accounts through their employers. This year, the Treasury Department worked with a small, diverse group of employers as part of the initial pilot phase of myRA to get feedback and ensure that the user experience is as simple and straightforward as possible. myRA is designed as a starter retirement account to help bridge the savings gap for many of these workers. It is optimized to appeal to first-time savers, for whom a no-risk, principal-protected investment is more appealing than a higher-risk investment option. As myRA account holders grow their savings, they have the option to transfer to a private-sector Roth IRA with diverse investment options at any time, or transfer to a private-sector Roth IRA once they reach the maximum myRA balance of $15,000. myRA is a Roth IRA and follows the same eligibility requirements. To participate in myRA, savers (or their spouses, if married filing jointly) must have taxable compensation to be eligible to contribute to a myRA account and be within the Roth IRA income guidelines. Savers can contribute to their myRA accounts as little as a few dollars up to $5,500 per year (or $6,500 per year for individuals who will be 50 years of age or older at the end of the year). Savers can also withdraw money they put into their myRA accounts tax-free and without penalty at any time. Roth IRA requirements apply to the tax free withdrawal of any earnings.

personalfinance,"Got married, adjusting my W-4... The worksheet says to put 2 allowances. The official online calculator says to put 15!? Help?","What the title says. My original allowance count was 6. I filled out the worksheet to the absolute best of my ability, and the count went down.

- I have two kids from a previous marriage, and due to the amount of time I have them over the year (exactly 50%) and the amount I pay in child support (yes, the ex and I both work jobs, but I pay $1000 a month in support), I get to claim them on my taxes.
- Being a single parent until now, I got to file as head of household.

Now the combined household income is just over $119,000 (yippee!), child support and visitation is the exact same. I was surprised that the allowance count went down, instead of up. So I double-checked using the [IRS's official allowance calculator](https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/), which seems to take a completely different pathway to the worksheet. And it said my allowances should go from 6 to 15, and my wife's should go from 2 to 5.

Now I'm terrified about what number to put down. I don't want to owe anything to the fed, but I'm not the kind of guy to give money to the fed when I would rather increase the amount of money I'm saving for a new house that we want to buy together, and can build interest on.

personalfinance,Some questions about doing taxes. Need help!,"Hi I have a few questions about taxes since it will be a little different for me this year.  I have a regular full time job that I pay taxes on (25% tax range).  I usually get around one thousand dollars back from federal.  These past few months I've started doing some work on Amazon's Mechanical Turk and I am expecting to make around one thousand dollars from that.  I've also made a around $200 from Swagbucks and Bing rewards.  All in all that should only be around $250 in taxes that will get taken off my refund so I don't think that should be an issue.

Now I am planning to move from Edward Jones to Vanguard.  The cost basis in my non-retirement account figures on the website are approximately -$280 in one fund and +$2,400 in another.  I was thinking of selling these and taking the capital gains tax hit (most of it is long term but a little will be short term) so I can move them into Vanguard funds.  Even if I assume everything was $25 that should only be a little $500 bringing my total to $750.

Tax-wise will I have any issues?  I know some people have to report estimated taxes but I if I understand correctly will I be find as long as I don't owe more than a one thousand in taxes?

My final question is what software would be able to allow me to file all these taxes myself?  Will I have to pay for software or will free ones be able to do all this?  I normally had just my income from my regular job so I had super simple taxes.  This year I would have my regular job, mturk (considered self employed taxes), swagbucks/bing (extra income?), and the mutual fund sales.

I am going to list my terms in hopes that you can verify that these terms will maximize my savings, that cards w/ these terms even exist, as well as point me in the direction of a website(s) that aggregate balance transfer card offers in order to find the best option.

#1.  A lot of these cards offer ""0%"" interest on the balance transfer for a specific allotted time (3mo-18mo).  I know the details are in the print, but from what i gather as long as no new purchases are made on the new balance transfer card, I won't be charged any interest on the balance transfer within the promotional time frame.

• I am looking for a card w/ a minimum of 6mo 0% interest on balance transfers.

#2.  Some of the balance card transfer offers that i've seen have anywhere from a 0-3% balance transfer fee.  In my case, 3% of $28k is $840.  

#3.  once the promotional rate is over, I am looking for a card w/ a fixed rate of less than 15.24% on the remaining balance.

• obviously i am looking for a 0% transfer fee card


Does a card like this exist?  If my math is correct, by transferring to a card that has these terms:

0% balance transfer fee, 0% interest on transfer balance for 6mo, and then fixed rate of &lt; 15.24% then I should be able to save the approx $400 in interest I currently pay for at least 6mo (a realized savings of approx $2400).

personalfinance,"Could someone look over my plan? Saving for pilot training(~$40k), paying for half on my own and the other half on a loan. Should I put the first portion, ~$9k, on a loan and immediately pay it off to build credit?","I'm 23, $7,000 in savings and for the next year I'm going to put away at least $1,100 a month toward my goal. In a year that'll put me at $20K. I'm 100% sure I can accomplish that. 

My plan is:
Private and instrument training at local part 61 school. 
Private cost should be $7k
Instrument should be maybe $15k. 
Should take me a year to finish all that working full time, still with that $1100/month to put toward training. 

The rest of pilot training is for a commercial license, mostly renting an airplane and building time in the cockpit. Maybe $20k I could string it out over the next two years, or I could go to a local ATP school on a loan. It's kindof a pilot mill, quality of training is not great because of rookie instructors, but instrument training is the hard part and I have a great independent instructor picked out. I'll go to the ATP school after I do the hard part with a good instructor. 

I was just thinking the other day that I'm young and don't have much credit, what if I can't get a loan? I've had a credit card for three years and always pay it off at the end of the month, usually $200. I also pay my student loan, $90 a month. I checked my credit score for the first time, it said it's 750. But is that a weak credit history being only three years? Would it be a good idea to take out a loan for the private training and pay it off right away? There's an option, https://www.pilotfinance.com/ which works with the instructor I have picked out. Only thing is the interest rate is like 9%, but they reimburse 3% if it's paid off early, so effectively 6%. Would it be better to put the training on a credit card and pay that off monthly? My card has a $1600 limit so I might need to get another one. But is that a good idea?

Also that's just sitting in my checking account, should that be in a savings account? 

I think that's everything. Tell me if you see any major plot holes in my plan. I know pilots don't make too much, not here to talk about that. I went to school for ATC and hiring sucks right now, having commercial should help me get picked up for that. If not I'll be a pilot.

My options are basically to either refinance my loan, which doesn't do much for me since I'd be still looking at a 60 month loan, higher interest rate than a new car loan. Minimal savings on the transaction; no money left in the bank.

I could trade in for a 20k car and come out with a 27-28k loan, better interest rate, lower payment (about $100/mth less), and no money in the bank.

I would prefer to get a nissan versa @ 13k but most places won't finance more than 140% of the car's value. If I could somehow find a bank to work with me, I'd be saving $200/mth in payments. (again, no money left in the bank)

I know the higher the list price, the more room there is to hide the upside down value in the loan, but a higher price point would leave me right where I am now.

Thanks for any advice.

“Employer XYZ matches $.50 on the dollar for the first 6 percent that you contribute pre-tax and/or Roth. 
There are three different contribution options under the Plan: pre-tax, Roth, and after-tax.”

I contribute 15% of my salary for 401k (pre-tax), therefore I get the full employer match.

**Does it make sense to contribute money into Roth and or After-Tax as well?
**

It says about both:
ROTH
Designated Roth contributions are elective deferrals for which you irrevocably elect special tax treatment. You will pay federal income taxes and, in most cases, state income taxes on the amount that you elect to contribute to the plan, up to the annual maximum IRS dollar limit. At the time of distribution, you may withdraw your contributions and any earnings on this money tax-free, as long as certain withdrawal criteria have been met. Your company may match all or a portion of these contributions.
 
 
AFTER-TAX
The amount you can contribute to a retirement savings plan, using a portion of your salary that has already been included in your taxable income. Income taxes have already been calculated on the amount contributed. However, any earnings on these contributions can grow tax-deferred. Income taxes are not due on any earnings until they are withdrawn from the plan.  Your company may match all or a portion of your after-tax contributions in order to provide them with the most flexibility regarding taxes. (It may be advantageous for some people to pay taxes on the contributions now, because they would be in a higher tax bracket during retirement).

personalfinance,Questions from a college student in debt hoping to save for study abroad opportunity,"Hello lovely people of personal finance, 

I have seen some fantastic advice for many things, and seen you help so many people so I was hoping you could do the same for me. 


I am currently a full-time student, working a job teaching around 25 hours per week making $11/hour. I have around 6,000 in credit card debt, split between 2 cards, that I'm working on paying down as much as I can, and looking into a really fantastic study abroad opportunity that I would hate to miss out on just due to funds. The program isn't until spring of 2017, and they do have a fair bit of scholarships available, and I should be getting financial aide as well, but I don't want to bank on that and have something fall through. 


So I'm looking for some advice. One of the cards is still in the 0% interest period until April, but the other with about 3000 on it has about a 14% interest rate, if I recall correctly. Would it be a good idea to get a new card and do a balance transfer to one that has good rates for that? Or bite the bullet on those interest charges instead of the possible hit to my credit score? I'm not sure what the best course is there. 


Second question: is there a savings account that you would suggest that I could use to keep the money I'm working on saving I'm that has a higher interest rate? I have about 1000 in the bank at the moment, but the program is around 22,000. Additionally, are there good savings tricks that have worked for you that you would suggest for a college student who is just plain bad at saving? 


Budget right now: 

Income: roughly 1500/month (work + help from dad) 

Rent: 567.50 (total 1135 split with partner) 

Internet: 38

Food:150-200

Embroidery machine: 158 until April (thus brings in additional income with occasional embroidery jobs and provides a creative outlet) 

Dad pays for gas (and I'm super super grateful for that, though I still take the bus to school, and drive the short commute to work) 

Bus pass:included with tuition

Partner pays electric

personalfinance,"20. I want to Finance a Car, why and why not?","Hello /r/personalfinance,

I need advice. I think I am finally ready.

I'm 20 years old, graduated(3 yrs, B.S) last May in the Northeast.
I've been working since June.

Starting Salary: $70k 

Current Salary: ~$80k

Student Loans: $30k - 4.5% Avg. Federal.

Saved Up Cash: $12k+

I keep low expenses because I'm currently living with friends of the family. I plan on moving within the next year after I've saved enough money, but it will be with roommates so my expenses should not go up by much at all.

Rent: $400(Utilities etc. included.)

Food: ~$200

Misc: ~$200

I don't really buy anything, and I don't go out drinking or whatever. I promise I still have a social life.

I was promoted fairly quickly, and may see another promotion soon. I work for a Fortune 500(top 10%), I don't want to be too specific but there is room for growth......Now to the point. I'm really looking to finance a new or CPO car. 


**Please hear me out before you tear into me.**

My current car has cost me ~400/mo. to repair for the last 4 months. This does not include regular maintenance, and it currently cannot pass state inspection without another major repair. Parts alone, $400.

My current insurance rate is near $200, liability only on a $2,400 car. Insurance quote on new(newer) car is ~$250 full coverage.

I understand it's not a wise financial decision, but I like cars, and I'd like to have something that doesn't leave me stranded every other weekend, and isn't embarrassing to drive to the office everyday. At this point I do not trust any car that's been previously owned, if not for CPO because I can somewhat bank on the warranty. My family history with used cars is very very murky. I would be interested in putting down $5k on a $20k car.


If you believe it is okay for me to finance, how should I go about getting a loan? Credit Union?

If you do not believe I should finance, speak now, or forever hold your peace.

personalfinance,"My girlfriend's debt is crushing, and I have no idea what to do","I wish I knew where to appropriately begin. 

Me and my significant other have been dating for approximately three years now, most of which has been a long distance relationship.   We've made it work, and as fate would have it,  I was accepted into my program in the same city she's been living in.  This would be the perfect time for us to finally close the gap and we could move in with each other.  I moved in with her late August, and it's only now I realize the depth of her financial peril.

Over the course of the last few months, my girlfriend has been making some extremely concerning decisions without putting any thought into how this could impact her in the future.  Before I moved to the city,  she was living with her parents free of rent so she could reign in the debt she accumulated over the years she spent in school (which she recently graduated from).  Things were going fine, and she had a period of wait time after she graduated before she could write the nurses exam in October and start working in the health field.  It's also during this time where things started to get out of control. 

To begin,  in April,  she bought her sisters dog.  Flat out,  impulsively,  decided to make a major decision by taking ownership of it.  However,  this isn't a small dog: it's a shepherd/husky mix,  and it needed space to move around.   Her parents profoundly refused to have the dog in their home, so her next course of action was to get a house.  She applied for a mortgage,  but was denied because of the lack of income her job offered.  You'd think that an apartment or a townhouse may have been acceptable,  but it apparently wasn't.  ""The dog needs a yard"" I was told.  She soon found a house to rent for 975.00 a month,  and at the start of May,  she moved into this house,  with her dog,  by herself. 

There was no way she was going to be able to pay this rental fee by herself,  but before I moved in, she managed to find a way.  That was mysterious to me until a few days ago,  where she told me the depth of her debt.   She struggled with credit cards bad before she moved out, and it seems she wasn't prepared to move into a place that costs nearly 1300.00 a month on her own when she wasn't paying rent at her parents. 

She owes now 18k in credit card debt,  spread over the course of what seems to be eight credit cards, one of which is capped at 7k.  Her interest rates are bleeding her dry, and she's having a bad time staying not only on top of payments but taking care of this dog that she shouldn't have gotten in the first place.   Her hours are varied,  but she simply doesn't have the means of tangibly paying off that debt,  even with me splitting the rent with her. 

She went to the bank yesterday to try and consolidate her debt,  but she was denied because of the lack of income.  I honestly don't see a solution,  until she gets a better paying job in her field, to consider bankruptcy.

I'm sorry for the length and rant of this post,  I'm at my wits end with this situation.  I'm posting here to see what her options could be to try and improve her situation,  and any and all help would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1447302501
investing,State of the Market: Completely Insane,"This market is 100% crazy stupid.  Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn’t understand the history of valuations and their effect on returns and doesn’t care about protecting their capital long term.  Yes, the current P/E is not as bad as other valuation metrics, but P/E ratio is one of the least reliable valuation metrics because of how short term oriented it is.

The most reliable long term valuation metric is the stock market to GDP ratio, which Warren Buffett often refers to as the “single most reliable measure of stock market valuation at any given time.”  As of today, the future projected returns are projected to be 1% per year INCLUDING dividends. This means that taking dividends out, you would have to subtract 2% per year, roughly, from the total returns. How accurate is it?  When looking at past results, it is 92% accurate and the times it deviates is when the future returns only deviate because of massive overvaluation extremes, like now, or undervalued extremes such as 1982. 

So first off, if you don’t read above and think that the next 10 years in the stock market are going to be ugly, you need to take all of your money out of the stock market, bury it in the back yard, and remove yourself from society because you’re dense.

Look at the period around 1999/2000…if anyone remembers those times, expectations were of 15-20% returns for the rest of time.  If you don’t believe me, go look up articles from Barrons and other financial organizations and see what was said by “professional” money managers who were considered experts.  The scary part is, we aren’t that far off of that time right now! The annualized return expected over the next 10 years is around 1% per year! WITH DIVIDENDS!! Which is close to what it was back in 1999 and 2000, when expected returns were sub 0% even with dividends, and things played out exactly that way. For valuations today, that means that based on 92% correlation, we should expect the nominal market price of the S&amp;P to be LOWER in 10 years than it is today because taking out dividends takes the nominal price of the S&amp;P growth to negative territory!

Historically, the average stock market to GDP ratio has been in the 90% range and as Warren Buffett says, when you are in the 60-70% range, you will do quite well for the foreseeable future.  However, at the start of past secular bull markets, the ratio has gone as low as 42% before the big rises start, which means that prices are much lower based on history.  Why?  Well think about it…

The most important thing to future returns is how much you pay for an investment today.  Can an investment still do well even if you pay more for it today than you wanted to? Of course.  That happens all the time. I’ve successfully done it in real estate. But when you are investing in a broad base of companies, like any diversified portfolio should be, it will all average out.  So you need to pay as little as possible, as a whole. The less you pay, the more return you will get because over the long run, stocks will perform to their long term valuation levels.  In the short run, it’s a crap shoot.  As Warren Buffett always says “stocks are a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long run.”  Which means that in the short run, the popular ones will do the best but in the long run, the fundamentals of cash and cash flow and revenue will be what determines success.

So in 1982, when the stock market to GDP ratio was around 42%, it would make sense that the following 18 years yielded 18% returns and when the stock market to GDP ratio was north of 1.5, as it is today, the following ten years produced very poor results.   Paying a higher price for anything will always take away future returns because returns are calculated on what you PAY for an investment.  The results will factor into your return as well, don’t get me wrong, but the income and cash flow are not at all affected by what you pay for the investment. They will be what they will be whether you pay $1 or $1MM for it.

10 Year Cyclically Adjust P/E Ratio

This was created many decades ago (earlier part of the 20th century) by the writers of Security Analysis, which is the Bible of value investing.  We all know that P/E is the price to earnings ratio and it can be applied to the market.  However, these guys understood that any given year can have massive fluctuations based on short term expenses or revenue gains that aren’t reflective of long term performance.  So what they did was even it out a bit by taking the present value of the previous 10 years of earnings and see where the market stood.  The historical average is around 16.6, and CURRENTLY we are at 27.  27! The only other time in HISTORY that it has been higher was 1999/2000.  In fact, all previous secular bear markets prior to 1999 started when the S&amp;P 10 year P/E was around 23-25! So we are even higher than what starts a 17-20 year flat stock market.

In past secular bull markets, the S&amp;P 10 Year P/E is in the single digits.  Usually around 6-9 so in this situation, for us to get to that level again, we would need the S&amp;P to go from 2100 today down to 700.  I know it sounds unfathomable but that’s where it would need to be to have the 10 year P/E at 9.  Is it a coincidence that when valuations are high, future returns are low and when valuations are low, future returns are high? Of course not.  Go back up and read my statements on paying more for an investment will always chip at your returns.  100% of the time.

I love watching CNBC and having all these pundits and experts talk about how we are in the early stages of a long term secular bull market.  Liz Ann Sonders is one person I love to pick on because she is the Chief Investment Officer at Charles Schwab and she should know much better.  But she doesn’t.  She doesn’t look at history just like 99.9% of the average person.  So pat yourself on the back for being just as smart as Liz Ann Sonders.

Valuations will ALWAYS mark the end and start of secular bear and bull markets.  Always. Remember, the less you pay for something, the better your return will be.  When valuations are low, you are paying less and therefore, your long term return will be higher.  So long term secular bull markets will ONLY begin when valuations are low.  How low?  Well below historical averages, that’s for sure.  And secular bear markets will begin when valuations are high.  How high? Higher than the long term average.

Remember, the average is the average but we are never at the average point.  We are always either overvalued or undervalued.  Never at fair value. (I say never but really what I mean is for a sustainable period of time…) So we talked about the historical average of 16.6 on the 10 year P/E, but how often are we actually there? 

GuruFocus.com says the current 10 year P/E is 25.5, which I won’t argue. Close enough to 27.  But if you look at the data, the average they have is the 16.6 that I mentioned above.  But how often did we actually hit that?  Very rarely! And we were never there for long.  So as you can see, stock valuations are never really at fair value for long enough to matter.  We are either over or under value at all times.  So you have to decide: are you going to be a buyer or seller at any given point?  Now, do I make my investing decisions based on this?  No. You can find good buys at high valuations and bad buys at good valuations.  But if I am buying broad based funds, then this would elicit some caution at the extreme levels.

BTW, interesting enough, look at when stocks were at their highest valuation peaks…1900, 1929, 1966, 2000, and today…what did stocks do after those levels?  See below…

In 1900, the S&amp;P was at the equivalent of 7.5 or so.  At this point, the 10 year P/E was around 22.  For the next 24 years, the S&amp;P fluctuated between 7 and 10 continuously until the late 1920s boom took things to the next peak/bubble.  Coincidence?  If you think so, you’re smarter than me.

In 1929, the S&amp;P 10 year P/E got to 27. The nominal price of the S&amp;P at that time was 25 or so.  So what happened after that?  The S&amp;P dropped down as low as 7 and didn’t recover to its previous high of 25 until 1952! It took 23 years for the market to hit the same level again. Again…coincidence?  Come on…let’s go to the next extreme…

In 1966, the S&amp;P 10 year P/E hit 24 and the S&amp;P’s nominal price was around 100.  So what happened from there? For the next 16 years, the S&amp;P went sideways and stayed at or below that level until 1982…which was the start of the biggest bull market run in history.

Now for the biggest market extreme ever…1999/2000.  The S&amp;P 10 year P/E got as high as 44 and since then, we have seen new highs…all the way up to 2100 as of late, but the S&amp;P also got as low as 666 and based on valuations, the only reason stocks are so high up right now is that they are at high valuation peaks…so this is not meant to show that paying a high premium is ok.  It is not.  We are going to have a bad stock market for the coming 10-12 years.  History has shown it going back to 1871..why would it be different now? It’s not.  It never is.  Yes, stocks can go higher and higher for a long period of time and irrationally, but it eventually stops.  The music stops.  And suddenly the chairs disappears…

Individual Stocks

Anyone who reads this has seen me short Amazon.  Well, I’ve been killed on it.  And guess what…I’m not worried.  Amazon officially is the most expensive stock, valuation based, in the stock market.  Granted, that’s based on P/E and we all know that P/E can fluctuate wildly but either way, it’s overpriced.  When other companies such as Wal-Mart and Target sell for 0.5 or 0.8 times revenue, Amazon is selling for 3 times revenue.  When other companies are selling for 3-5 times book value, Amazon is selling for 28 times book.  There is no valuation metric that shows Amazon is a good deal.  It has more than doubled in stock price this year alone.

No one cares about valuations during bull markets.  Look at private venture tech companies.  We have never had more “unicorns” (private start ups that are valued over $1Billion) ever in our history.  Including 1999/2000, the most overpriced tech market we have ever had!

The scary part, for investors, should be that Square just announced they are going public for 33% LESS than their last round of private valuation! Less! That’s not good.  They raised money at a $6Billion valuation recently but are now going public based on a $4Billion valuation.

Back in 1999/2000, the only positive of the market was that smaller companies didn’t have bad valuations.  The horrible valuations were on the higher end value of companies.  Today, we are seeing it on all levels, but also high end value companies are seeing larger than life valuations.  Yahoo, Facebook, Amazon, Adobe, etc…these companies have been around for a while and are still sporting very high valuations! As I write this, some douche from Edward Jones named Aaron is saying that he has Amazon as a strong buy because of robust growth and stronger margins.  Meanwhile, he also says he values Amazon’s retail business at 2.5 times revenue….WTF?!?!

Here is why I am confused.  Amazon has worse margins on their retail portion than Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart sells for 0.5 times earnings but he decides to put 2.5 times margin on there?!?! Why?!?! Why not 3 times? Why not 4? 5? 6? Just saying a number when the average is a lot lower is insane…of the 81 consumer companies on the S&amp;P 500, the average price to sales ratio CURRENTLY in this massively overpriced market is 1.8 times earnings and the average gross margins is 40% and Amazon’s, on their retail side, is 24%.  Wait, so they are 40% lower on margins and they are worth a premium to sales?  Does that even make sense?  yes, it is growing but as it has grown it’s margins have decreased and the majority of their better margins are coming from AWS, it’s cloud computing services which is a commodity.  It will be a price war. Margins will shrink because the costs to operate are pennies. Google and Microsoft are already in it and growing their portions like crazy.

Another example: Tesla.  Tesla is a great company. Their product rocks.  They’re the new hot thing.  But what’s it worth to us?  So typically, car companies sell for the following:

Ford: 0.38 times sales

GM: 0.39 times sales

Honda: 0.48 times sales

Toyota: 0.83 times sales

Daimler: 0.54 times sales

Are we seeing a pattern yet?

Tesla: 7.1 times sales.

WTF?!?!? Why?!?! Yes, they are cool. Yes, their cars are awesome. But they make no money! Yes, they are trying to grow, but something has to give!! Yes, their gross profit margin is much better than Ford and GM, but it’s not THAT much better than Daimler, Honda, and Toyota, who all sport around 22% margin and Tesla has a bit over 24% margin! So what gives?!?! It doesn’t add up at all. But it’s a sexy and fun company and so everyone will pay whatever they can to get it.

What is the Right Price?

When I go back to my high school, the first thing I do is take my iPhone out and say “Who here has this kind of phone and loves it?”  Sure enough, over half the class raises their hand? So I then asks the students “would you pay $1 for this phone?” And of course, they say “of course we would.”  No duh.  Then I ask “Would you pay $1Million for this phone?”  And of course they say “no way.”  Again…duh.

But that’s what it seems is what happens with stocks like Amazon, FaceBook, Tesla, etc….people say the product or company is awesome so pay whatever it takes to own it.  You may say I am wrong about this, but I’m not.  Why is 7.1 times sales ok for Tesla when similar companies are getting 0.8 times sales, at best?  Why is 3 times sales ok for Amazon when similar companies are selling for 0.5 times sales?

This is a prime example of a bubbling market.  There are massive overvaluations across the board and margins are high because of lower interest costs because of the Fed reducing rates so aggressively over the past 6 years and keeping them low.  When corporate debt interest charges are down 80%, of course you earnings on the same revenue will increase but it doesn’t mean you’re a better company because of it.

If you think about investments the same way I thought about the iPhone, you will realize that there is a price for EVERYTHING.  It doesn’t matter what it is. You can buy a pile of dog shit for the right price as long as you can figure out a way to make something on it.  There is always a price for something.  When Long Term Capital Management went under and rocked the financial world in 1997, Warren Buffett made an offer to buy the very assets that took the company down.  So the same assets that took a company down had gone down in price enough that it was attractive enough for Buffett to make an offer on it. That is a prime example of how prices are what dictates the returns.

Recap

It’s hard to see the market go up and read something above. I get it.  I’m not here to argue that the market can’t go up higher because it can.  And it probably will.  Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.  Look at Japan.  Those markets have been irrational for decades.

But at the end of the day, valuations do matter. And anyone who thinks that buying today will yield good results long term has another thing coming.  It may not happen this year, but it will happen eventually.  People have to give up on stocks for stock prices to go to the point where they are a great buy again. Literally they need to be saying “if you want to retire well, do not buy stocks.” Just like in 2009 when the world fell apart and in that same year in real estate.  People have to give up.

Peter Lynch has an anecdote he has told many times.  He talks about how he knows when to buy or sell stocks.  When he goes to a cocktail party and people are telling HIM what to buy, he knows it’s time to sell.  When he goes to the cocktail party and people are feeling bad for him for being a money manager, he knows it’s a good time to buy.  People think you MUST own stocks and that’s when things get crazy.  Prices have to drop and prices only drop when people don’t want something anymore.

There will be a tipping point soon.  Just like it was mortgage backed securities in 2008.  That isn’t what caused markets to crash, it is just what caused markets to care about valuation suddenly.  The tipping point is something we don’t know or see yet, probably.  But when it happens, everyone will blame this one thing and then later say they saw it happening.  So many people now say “it was so obvious that real estate was overpriced back in 2008.”  Oh was it?  Hmm.  It’s ego on my part because I have 3 years of blog posts showing my views on the market and so far I have been “wrong.”

When this market does take a turn, for us to get to the point of starting a real secular bull market, we have to get to an ugly place.  Years and years of bad returns.  People have to give up.  We aren’t anywhere near that now.  Even 2008 and 2009 wasn’t that bad.  I think in the last 12 years, we have have 11 of them be up years.  That’s unreal.  It shows you how short and quick the last drop was. You don’t lose faith in markets when it’s a quick pop and then rebound.  We need a long term drudging.  It will eventually happen…but I just don’t know when.",finance,1447302690

personalfinance,Is my understanding of credit card payments and debt correct? Could anyone provide a critique?,"I recently got my first credit card and have been reading up on them to make sure I have a good initial understanding of them. I had these two basic questions:

1. Will only paying the minimum monthly payment negatively impact my credit?
2. How much will it ""cost"" me in interest to only pay the minimum each month?

After some research, this is my answer to those questions:

If I have credit card debt, then at the end of the month I have to pay at least the minimum balance, or else it will negatively impact my credit. If I continue paying the minimum balance without adding more debt, I will eventually pay off my debt. Any debt that isn't paid off (money in excess of the minimum that I paid) for the period it was created in will then have an interest rate applied to it. This rate is a function of my APR (Right?). So essentially for that period the interest I paid will be equal to this formula:

Assuming an APR of 16.9%

(total debt - minimum payment)*(16.9/12)


Is this all right? If it is, then my next question would be: How dangerous (In terms of personal finances as well as credit score) is it to keep a rolling balance month to month of credit card debt, rather than pay it off in full each month?

I hope this post and any responses to it will be a useful resource to anyone who is new to credit cards and how they work.

Why so much interest? I have been trying to pay $700 instead of the $404 because honestly I just want to pay it off asap but now that I checked my payment summary, I feel so discouraged. The first payment I made back in May I paid $1000 and I noticed the principal was only $740 and interest was $260. Like WTH....I used a car loan calculator and it says my payments should at least be $355 a month instead of the $404. I'm so new to this which is why I'm really confused. My current car loan is of $18,900. What can I do? Am I getting charged more interest than I should? I need your help/advice please. I was thinking about refinancing but since my credit score is low (660) I was thinking of doing that next year once it's a little higher in the 700s.",finance,1447306139
personalfinance,"Switching from Salary to Hourly, Calculate my rate","Hi,

I decided that I didn't want to work for my current company as a salary employee, my salary is 88K/year and averaging about 44-45 hours worked per week, I went up to them and asked to be made a consultant at a rate of 85/hr or I'm leaving. They said that it would be to difficult b/c I'm full time and it's going to raise a lot of flags with the IRS so I said fine, I can stay as an employee but I want to  get paid hourly. Now I have to come up with a rate, I don't want to go to low and defeat the purpose of actually make it worth my while to stay but at the same time I don't want to go above what they would have to pay if I were a consultant at 85/hr, so I know it has to be a lower rate; right now the company pays half my Federal taxes and I thInk some other taxes (excuse my ignorance), half my health insurance, and contribute to my 401K (.25 up to 6%). How would you guys go about calculating a rate as employee that would be kind of equal as I would make as an $85/hr consultant?

Thank you!",finance,1447308301
personalfinance,Aaaand there goes my credit. HELP,"OK so I made the mistake of consigning a car with my boyfriend's mom. The car is in her name but my bf was making the payments. She alone could have signed for the car but adding my name to the car loan saved them thousands of dollars by knocking down the interest rate. He assured me that it would be paid on time and it has been for the past 6 months ($433 ea. mo).

Well my boyfriend has made an incredibly dumb mistake and will be incarcerated for who knows how long but it's gonna be some time. We are awaiting trial. His mother will not put a dime toward the car and has informed me that she doesn't care about her credit so the bank can take it for all she cares. In the mean time I am desperately asking her to get me out of the equation but with her son in jail it is simply not her priority. (I want her to call and refinance the loan with her name alone on the contract)

Now I am stuck on a loan that I can not pay for a car that I don't drive. I have my own Nissan sentra which still has 2 years of monthly payments at $300 a month. I need advice. What do I do? ..........I also have a car for sale lol $22,000 non negotiable price (due to my situation / that is the payoff amount).

Even if the car doesn't sell and gets taken by the bank, if it doesn't auction for the $22,000 then they will come after his mom and I for the difference. Credit means so much to me.

Bitcoin,Pay Attention Please.,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest claim for financial freedom in the history of our nation.

Around 6 years ago, a great inventor, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, wrote the Whitepaper. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of financial slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their oppression.

But still years later, the citizen is not free. The life of the ordinary guy is still sadly crippled by the manacles of inflation and the chains of debt. Now the worker lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of bankers prosperity. And so I stand here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we've come to here to cash a check. When the architect of our freedom wrote the magnificent Bitcoin Whitepaper he was signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Moon. 
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this coin. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.

We have also come to this hallowed sub reddit to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of Bitcoin. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of sub $400 to the sunlit path of $1000 and higher. Now is the time to lift our community from the quicksands of financial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make Moon a reality for all of Satoshi's children.

It would be fatal for us to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the community's legitimate block size discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating winter of discussion and resolution. BIP101 is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Bitcoiner needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the community returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in Bitcoin until the Block Size is resolved. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our community until the bright day of justice emerges.

But there is something that I must say to you , those who stand on the warm threshold which leads unto the Moon: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for financial freedom by drinking from the cup of scam and theft. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into trolling or doxxing. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of harsh words with soul force.

The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Bitcoin community must not lead us to a distrust of all altcoins, for many of our altcoin brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.

We cannot walk alone.

And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.

We cannot turn back.

There are those who are asking the devotees of cryptocurrency, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as the citizen is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of federal reserve brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of chart watching, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the reddit subs. 
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from buying at the top (again). And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of moderator brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to the Whitepaper, go back to the Bitcoin forums, go back to your trading exchanges, go back to the ATMs, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.

Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.

And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream.",cryptocurrency,1447315980
personalfinance,Need help on what steps to refinance a car loan not entirely in my name?,"I have a car loan right now standing at $6900 with an interest rate of 10.2%. At its current rate i'll be done paying it off in 2 years, maybe 1 since i've been overpaying by a lot. Unfortunately to qualify my dad had to be the main signer on the loan, although both our names are on the title. And i make the payments directly from my own account to the loan.

The problem/question is that my school workload is about to triple from where it is now, requiring me shave off a lot of hours from work. Right now i pay $280+ a month on the loan, $115 for insurance. This is by far my largest expense, and i want to either refinance the loan to extend it so as to lower the payments, or lower the interest rate to lower the payments. 

First, can i even start to apply for refinancing even if the loan is not directly in my name?

Second, is this even worth a try, i've been paying for the car for 3 years and have only been late on a payment once. Will this affect the decision?

No, i won't sell the car, i'm over 3/4 done paying for it and if i sold it now my profit from it would be minuscule compared to what the actual cost of keeping the car would be. 

I've been pinching/cutting down all my bills, and this is the last one. Other then this i have zero debt, but i need to minimize the impact this has on my bills for the time being so as to not affect my grades.",finance,1447317635

personalfinance,how can I keep inflation from diminshing my short term savings value?,"Dear personal finance. I'm a 24 year old Norwegian student and part-time worker. For the past year my girlfriend and I have been saving money to travel the world for 7 months. Our plan is to leave in 1 year.  Our target is 100 000 NOK each.

As oil production is the cornerstone of the norwegian economy the drop in oil prices have so far taken it's toll, and future prospets are uncertain. Unemployment is rising, spending is decreasing and the norwegian currency (NOK) is losing value rapidly. 

In the last year the NOK value has fallen comparatively to the Euro from 8.4 NOK per Euro to 9.3 now. Similarly a year ago 1 USD was 6.8 NOK and is now 8.6.

To put this into context the economic crisis in 2008 had a limited direct effect on the Norwegian economy, due to our income from oil exports, and a fair amount of public spending taken from our government pension fund. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Pension_Fund_of_Norway). 

However in order to encourage exports of other goods to Europe, to maintain production and keep unemployment in check, the key interest rate has been kept at an all time low since 2008. This has resulted in a booming economy with massive personal debt and skyrocketing housing prices. Our economy is at this moment not well equipped to handle a national unemployment crisis. 

Considering the current economy, the high personal debt, and an already all time low key rate. Combined with the current refugee situation and the need for public spending this requires. There is, in my unskilled opinion, a fair to good chance that the inflation will keep rising.

This is starting to make me nervous that the value of our 2 years worth of savings will be far less than what we will need for our trip. 

Therefore my question to you personal finance is this: How can I prevent the value of my savings from diminishing over the next year. Are there investements that can be safely made for as short a term as 1 year? Should I keep my savings in a different currency? if so which? or is the safest move to stick it out?

Any insights or opinions will be much appreciated.",finance,1447321394

Bitcoin,Making the protocol itself extensible via apps.,"Banks and stock markets are making their own block chains that will be faster and more functional than Bitcoin.  Companies are turning to Ethereum because of its feature set. Even fixing the block size issue will still leave Bitcoin dwarfed functionality-wise by everything coming in the pipeline. 

Bitcoin is a protocol that can have products &amp;amp;amp; services built on top of it.  This is where bitcoin suddenly becomes a better product offering than all the others. It's has the largest network, and the greatest level of security. It's just lacking in features.  Extensibility. 

Just like the iPhone creating the App Store, turning a simple cell phone into a diverse tool for thousands of products and services, couldn't we take the Bitcoin protocol and make it extensible, so that an entirely new industry of financial products and services can be built on top of it?

Is this something that could be built into the protocol itself?  Enabling apps?  Something that would take this foundational layer protocol, and allow thousands of systems to ""latch"" into it and build on top of it? 

I realize side chains are a layer on top that plans to do this.  But what about building something into the protocol itself that allows for extensibility? Whatever Apple did with their iPhone software that allows it to become more than just a phone. Wouldn't that be a worthwhile, one-time modification to the protocol, that opens up an entirely new universe for bitcoin? 

Apologies if this is a stupid question.

personalfinance,[Advice] Young adults and students applying for a loan (CAN),"Hi fellow financers of Reddit. I'm in Canada and with TD bank. I am 22, applied for a personal loan that was $3600 to buy a new computer and software for freelance work. I decided to jump right in and apply for it online on their website because the convenience was there / have good reputation for borrowing money in a loan / wanted the money instead of using savings I had. 

Here's the catch, they just slapped me with an interest over 11 months that would be 15% (a lot!). I didn't bother to ask if the rate could be adjusted because I (assumed) that they would give me the best rate when I applied. I was wrong. I went with the loan for 4 months on 15% of $3600 and it ended up being ~$100 in interest, alone. Just some background, I have a great credit score of 850+ and no debt, and always pay back anything i owe on my credit card asap.

Finally, I decided to go to the bank in person for a checkup and meeting with a financial rep. It was the best thing I could have done. The rep let me know that if I wanted to do something like that, to always come in to the bank and ask for an adjusted rate. I ended up cancelling the loan and applied for a line of credit of $5000, being only 7%, and the minimum per month is very low which was much different from a personal loan. With my current credit score and income coming in from my new job, I was able to apply for one extremely easily and with a much lower rate. 

Don't make the same mistake as I did, when you are thinking of applying for a personal loan / line of credit, always go to the bank and the number one thing you should ask is if you can have an adjusted interest rate. It ended up being that the bank kept the exact same rate for me since I was a child and never bothered to adjust it based on credit score until I had a meeting with a financial rep to get it all settled. Don't assume you'll get the best rate, always ask.",finance,1447344213

personalfinance,Student loan debt! No savings,"Hello Reddit,

I have been a lurker here for a while now. I have read some of the posts here so I decided to post this. 

I am a 27 year old guy with more than 23K worth of student loans. I am currently working at a biopharma firm earning around 70K/year. I wanted your advice on how to pay off my student loans soon.

Here are my student loan details

Original amount - $35K at 14% (I am an international)
I have paid 18K in installments, but i would need another 23K if I have pay it off immediately or 
$28K if I pay it off by June 2017. I have started paying $1200 a month

Car: Camry Leased: I am planning to buy it at the end of my lease.

Credit card debt: I don't have any debt. I pay off my statements every month.

I have NO savings: I have been sending  money back home every month for repaying the loan. 

Is there a way to get a loan here in the US at a much lower interest rate. I can't refinance my loan here in the US as my student loan is from a different country.

Can I save tax on the interest paid? I read that $2500 is the maximum amount for that. I am not sure if  internationals are allowed those kind of provisions.

I am also getting married next year and I will have spend around 10-13k for my wedding (I really don't have an option to avoid this)
The debt freaks me out! I have not been able to get proper sleep! So any help on this matter is much appreciated!

This is the simplified overview of my Finances. On top of this, I have about $300 flat I owe currently on my Credit Card and still owe $1,450 for having my secondary vehicle repaired to working order (not currently making payments as the mechanic is a family friend who does it on the side and has not yet served me with a final bill -- legit, just hasn't gotten around to it). Also, my Mother currnetly owes me ~$700 for helping her out with some sudden bills she had awhile back which she is paying back when she can/wishes.

&amp;nbsp;

Now then, currently I am not paying anything on Student Loans. I'm currently in half-time enrollment, and with some luck (scheduling-wise as far as what I need being offered) I will graduate May or December 2016. Once this is all said and done, my Payments should work out to roughly $385.00/mo currently, though this is by current numbers (interest is growing at about $4.12 a day).  

&amp;nbsp;

First off, I know that I will definitely save money if I stop eating out so much. Second, due to new responsibilities I should be receiving some form of raise at my job this next June, not to mention the sizable lump I expect once my Bachelors Degree is complete.

--------------------------------------------

Now, the new consideration. After running the numbers in my head compared to the local market, I've now started the process to see what I pre-qualify for in Home Loans at my local bank. I have a solid relationship with a woman who works in town (Lawyer), and while we both agree it is too soon to go in on a house together, I have begun Window shopping for a house on my own just to see if I can find a reasonable upgrade from my apartment for similar in what I'm currently paying in Rent (have paid $445/mo since May 2012 for a current total of ~$19,000).

&amp;nbsp;

I have never bought a house before, but for 24 years old feel like I have myself in a pretty solid situation and wondered if some of you could weigh in with some advice on the thought of buying a house (possibly) given what I still owe in Student Loans. While I am considering beginning to pay on my Student Loans (again, not currently) once I graduate my plan is to flat pay $500/mo if not more as finances allow -- pending the purchase of a House.

&amp;nbsp;

Can I get some opinions from you guys on how to proceed? Sorry if everything is a bit essay-like, I just wanted to get everything thoroughly detailed.

investing,ECB Head’s Inflation Comments Causes Drop in Bond Yields &amp; Stocks,"&gt;U.S. and European government bond yields dropped on Thursday on indications of further monetary policy stimulus by the European Central Bank, while stocks fell, led by sectors most influenced by weak global demand trends.

&gt;All other euro zone yields were down on the day.

&gt;The dollar had rallied against the euro after remarks by ECB head Mario Draghi, who warned that price inflation, a key measure of economic health, was lagging.

&gt;German 10-year yields rose 2 basis points to 0.607 percent DE10YT=TWEB.

&gt;“Should we find ourselves in a persistent state of low nominal interest rates and low inflation, some of our fundamental assumptions about how U.S. monetary policy works may have to be altered,” Bullard said in prepared remarks.

&gt;Losses on Wall Street stocks revived safe-haven demand for government debt.

personalfinance,"Question About Public Service Loan Forgiveness &amp; ""Full-time"" Designation","So, I'm currently in a battle to have my application accepted and I have spoken with the FedLoan people multiple times and it pertains to the definition of ""Full-time"" in the employment certification form.  Here is how it is defined in the certification form:

&gt;Full-time means working in qualifying employment in one or more jobs for the **greater of:**

&gt;* An annual average of at least 30 hours per week or, for a contractual or employment period of at least 8 months, an average of 30 hours per week; or
&gt;* Unless the qualifying employment is with two or more employers, **the number of hours the employer considers full time.**

I've highlight the sticking point in my situation.  I've received differing answers from FedLoan but this highlighted portion seems to imply that employment designation doesn't necessarily matter so long as an employee works the hours that their employer classifies as ""full-time"".

For me, I am classified as 0.75 FT, but I've also been working about 40 hours since I was hired.  My employer considers 36 hours/week to be full-time but when I first submitted my application HR was using my classification within the company so I was checked as a part-time employee.

I've had some reps tell me this is correct, I've had others tell me that a part-time employee who works full-time hours would qualify, and I just got off the phone with someone who wouldn't (or couldn't) say which determination is correct.  All she said was, ""we go by what your employer says"".  I pressed her and asked which definition is the correct definition because I can be checked as either part-time or full-time on this sheet depending on how PSLF defines full-time.  She couldn't say and only replied with, ""if you're employer says you are full-time, that's what we go by"".

I resubmitted my application a week ago after being told that meeting the hourly requirements for a full-time employment qualified by itself.  I asked this rep the same question in about 5 different ways, and outlined my situation explicitly and she reaffirmed each time.  Took this information to HR and HR gladly filled out the paperwork and checked me as ""Full-time"".

Called FedLoan to check the status and they say they have to call the rep who signed the sheet because of my designation change.  Obviously, the problem here is that the answer they receive will largely depend on how the question is asked.

1.  What is his employment status within your company?  Part-time = denied.

2.  Does he work the minimum number of hours per week to be considered a full-time employee?  Yes = full-time = approved.

Does anyone know what PSLF considers full-time?  It seems to me if full-time employment status was an absolute necessity that they wouldn't have to have the statement pertaining to the ""greater of"".  If you needed to be classified as full-time at a minimum of 30 hours per week, there's no reason to include the part that says:

&gt;the number of hours the employer considers full-time.

If full-time designation is an absolute prerequisite, the ""greater of"" statement is unnecessary because a full-time designation with a minimum of 30 hours/week qualifies and it is automatically inclusive of anything greater than 30 hours/week.

Has anyone gone through this situation with similar circumstances?

It appears as though the designation checkbox can be different depending on how the inclusion criteria is written, which means that some people are accepted and others are denied based solely on how their HR rep reads the prerequisites.",finance,1447363121

See, This man fell for the Strawman Credit scam and had talked his father into willfully not paying his mortgage anymore from it. If you want to learn more about it, this scam is rooted in the Redemption or Sovereign Citizen movements, 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redemption_movement

which through a long and involved contrived bit of nonsense try to claim that you can just make a mortgage ""Disappear"" by arguing with the bank that they didn't lend you any real money. Since they didn't actually lend you the money, your mortgage is ""Invalid"" since it says that the bank will lend you money for something. There is some other pseudo legal nonsense that they throw about but it's more nonsense to make it sound legit.

This of course is a scam, and one so insane I didn't think I'd ever have to explain it, but as we're taught in school, ""Where one is brave enough to ask a question, 5 more are silent."". So I figure it's worth it to say something.

There is no legal wrangling that makes a bank automatically forgive your debt. You do not have a ""Scarecrow Credit"" and you do not have a fund with the federal reserve you are entitled to. The united states runs on fiat currency, and while you can debate the merits of such a system, it is real money that is used every day, and banks and creditors are not going to roll over and go away because you told them it isn't worth anything. Banks can make mistakes, and sure, if a bank makes a mistake you may be able to use that to your advantage. But there is no magical ""Get out of jail free"" secret that exists that you can get by buying a 20 dollar pamphlet, so please, I beg you, pay your mortgage or if you cannot, seek loan modification, and don't fall for this nonsense. Because he has, this man and his father are going to lose their family home, and I'm sure that they'll be standing on the courthouse steps lamenting how my bank didn't ""Follow the rules"" or some such silliness.",finance,1447369585

We live together and recently bought a parcel of land in my hometown, so we have a shared asset and about $50k in shared debt. I realize it was stupid of me to agree to this purchase and debt with him, but I believe now that he manipulated me into purchasing this with him to share the expense.

My biggest struggle right now is the financial aspect of the breakup. Again, I know buying land with him was stupid. I know taking a shared loan was also stupid. Our current financial picture is this: We owe $5K on a shared line of credit. Both names are on this loc and it is tied to my online banking so I am able to make changes to it without his knowledge (until he receives a statement).

I (we) owe $25K on my student line of credit. 100% of this is the cost of the land, as I had no student loans remaining when I graduated. This is entirely in my name, although 20K could be transfered to the shared line. The only reason it's on my student line is because of the lower interest rate.

He (we) owe his parents $10K. This was also part of the land purchase, but his agreement with his parents is that he is fully responsible and they will not ask me for anything.

We own a 2.5 acre lot worth approx $50K although it's likely not going to sell any time soon. I would be interested in keeping it to build on in the future, but I don't know if I can afford to buy out his half. He paid $10K from his savings, and I paid nothing for the lot having just finished university.

We also own a ""tiny house"" worth approximately $10K. The plan was to live in it on our land until we could build, but that is no longer an option due to town by-laws and busy bodies. I could probably rent a corner of land from a farmer to park the tiny house on to live in and still satisfy the by-laws.

Currently we are living in a house we rent from my parents. I can't afford the rent on my own, and my parents can't afford to give me a break on the rent. I have family I could move in with if need be until I get on my feet.

I earn 30K per year and still attend school in the evenings (part time).  He earns close to 90k and owns two other properties.

This will be our first experience with home shopping, having lived in a destitute foreclosure house that my parents had bought, then moved out soon after to better lodgings. The roof leaks in multiple places, foundation is crumbling, septic is broken, mold, there are more drafts than fantasy football league, electrical and plumbing issues, the lot. We need to get out.



**Now the financial situation:**

I started as a Data Systems Analyst for a University 4 months ago, with $37.5k annual salary. This breaks down to $2180 a month, after taxes/benefits, and about $250 in personal bills (excluding utilities, since I'm hoping to move!) I'm currently supporting my fiancee, who is in nursing school, to finish this year. She works to pay her expenses, but not much else. She also has a $600/month tuition bill through this April, and ~$50k in debt. Upon passing her boards, there is a full time RN position available to her through her current employer.

The house is $130k, and my credit is 676. When talking to my bank, they said I would be approved for a 3% down payment on a standard mortgage. Since I haven't had time to build much savings, that is about all I could afford to put up as a down payment. What do you think Reddit, can I pull this off?

* What would be an estimated monthly bill?
* How would I shop around for interest rates?
* Would it be beneficial/detrimental to cosign with my fiancee?
* What are some tips to home shopping?
* How tight do you think my budget would have to be?
* Can I afford this?

business,Will the ultra low 0.3% CPI inflation rate keep the USA Federal Reserve from raising interest rates this year?,"""Central bankers at Jackson Hole search for answers on low inflation
Why is inflation so low? Is it a sign that the U.S. economy hasn’t recovered? 
Or is it due to global factors?
These are the questions Federal Reserve officials and global central bankers will grapple with at the U.S. central bank’s annual Jackson Hole policy summit.
The Jackson Hole gathering starts with dinner on Thursday night followed by two days of discussions on Friday and Saturday. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer will present his views on inflation developments on Saturday at 12:25 p.m. Eastern.
Questions about price developments are not ivory-tower concerns.
If inflation is low because of a tepid recovery, then any Fed rate hike could damage the economy.
The U.S. central bank has been inching closer to hiking rates. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen has said she wants to raise interest rates this year provided two conditions are met. One condition, continued job market improvement, has largely been met.
The second condition is that the U.S. central bank has “reasonable confidence” that inflation is moving higher. With the labor market stronger, the Fed has expected inflation to pick up.
But it hasn’t happened. Adding to the puzzle, wages have remained dormant.
The Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditure index, has been below the central bank’s 2% annual rate target since 2012. It was up at an 0.3% annual rate in June.
William Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, admitted Wednesday that inflation is moving “sideways.”
William Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, admitted Wednesday that inflation is moving “sideways.”
In June, Fed officials forecast inflation will pick up to 1.6%-1.9% in 2016.
This reflects the Fed’s majority view that inflation will move higher, once the “transitory” impacts of the steep drop in oil prices and the strong dollar wear off.

But the recent spate of bad news from China and the global economy “suggests a delay of another couple of months” before there will be any signs of inflation moving higher, said Mark Gertler, economist at New York University.
Earlier Wednesday Dudley expressed caution about a rate hike in September, saying he felt a move was “less compelling.”
Postponing a rate hike until the later part of the year would not be the end of the world, Gertler said.
But “it is going to be awkward” if the Fed has to delay a rate hike until 2016, he said.
Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics, said inflation’s recent performance has challenged the economic profession’s basic assumptions about the behavior of prices.
“I would argue inflation is a mystery,” Sinai said.
He said the summit should discuss why the Fed has a 2% inflation target.
“When I ask central bankers why they chose 2% as a target, they can’t give me a good explanation why,” he said.
Sinai said another theory that no longer seem to apply is the “natural rate” of unemployment or the lowest rate of unemployment that an economy can sustain without sparking inflation.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the natural rate is 5.0%. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.3% in July.",finance,1447428746

btc,"Stay vigilant, the banksters are coming","So, there are some things people should be aware that is going on by the bankers of the world; you know, those guys who trashed the economy, got massive bailouts, and let the average home owner take the fall.  Yeah, those guys.  Not everyone listens to everything these guys say, but for those of us with our ears open, they have been saying some startling things, even out in public.

The crazy things they are saying include some of the following:

* They want to make cash illegal.  I'm dead serious about this.  They very strongly want to make cash illegal and it is already happening in phases in various countries in Europe.  Since cash is the money of choice when it comes to evading taxes and the black market; that will be their excuse.  As far as they are concerned any cash transaction is a 'suspicious' transaction and, soon, they want to make it completely illegal.

* So, why do they want to make cash illegal?  Because once the only money you can hold is controlled by the banks they can do the following.

- They can track every single financial transaction you make, down to the last penny.  And by 'they', I mean the government with the help and cooperation of the banks.

- If they suspect 'suspicious' activity, or really for any reason at all, they can freeze and/or confiscate your funds. The reason they can do this is that the moment your money is 'in a bank' it stops being 'your' money.  It is the banks money, and all you have is an IOU which they may not honor.

- They can directly deduct taxes without your consent.

- They can directly deduct any other fines or fees the state feels you are obligated under.

- They can conduct 'bail-ins' where they, quite literally, simply steal money from your account.  This has already happened and it is the plan of record for any future banking crisis that might arise.

- Probably the number one reason they want to institute a ban on cash is this.  They want to create negative interest rates.  Everyone already knows that you don't earn anything by 'leaving your money in a bank' any more.  Interest rates are near zero (unless you are a bank lending out money; in which case you can charge obscene interest rates all you want).  So, what are 'negative interest rates'?  This is when the bank charges you money for the privilege of holding your money for you.  We already have the first taste of negative interest rates in the form of overdraft fees; for which banks are collecting 35 billion dollars a year.  But, no, what they want to do is outright theft.  They want to simply remove money directly from your account and expect you to thank them for the privilege.  And, why would you 'thank' them?  Because once cash is made illegal, the only way you will be able to participate in any economic activity is with a banking account; and you are paying for 'access' to the financial system.

- You might ask, hey John, what about bitcoin?  Yeah, they plan to make that illegal too.  With extreme prejudice.  You might wonder, but wait, how can they stop bitcoin?  I didn't say they could stop bitcoin, from a technical standpoint they cannot, what I said is they can make it illegal to use.  And, once they do that, 100% of all bitcoin transactions will be considered a felony crime.  (BTW, I am not making this up, these are the words direct out of the mouth of senior bankers in just this past week; Jamie Dimon and Blythe Masters in particular).  So, once bitcoin is made illegal the only thing you will be able to use it for is on the black-market and, even then, in only a very limited fashion.  No business will accept it for payment. You will not be able to treat it as an investment either.  The value will plummet because its value is based on how useful it is, and if it is illegal, the use will be very limited.

So, please folks, stay vigilant.  Do not allow them to make cash illegal, forcing you to only use a banking account for all financial transactions.  And, be alert, they *will* provide their own cryptocurrency that, at first glance, looks just like bitcoin but it operates in dollars instead.  It will seem great at first, until you realize that they control the keys.  They can block your funds, confiscate your funds, and, most importantly, track every single penny you ever send to or from any person or business, and use that to spy on you and as an excuse to steal your money; euphemistically called 'asset forfeiture'.  

I'm not making any of this stuff up folks.  Most people neither think about the international banking system or the nature of money very much.  It is complicated and if you try to engage in dialog with the banksters they will use so much confusing terminology that you will quickly be lost.  This is entirely on purpose.  They don't want the average person thinking about how the banking system actually operates or how money is created and controlled.  If you value any sense of financial freedom, you need to stay vigilant; because once these people start saying this right out in the open the noose is getting tight around our necks.",cryptocurrency,1447430272

personalfinance,Student Loans with High Percentage Interest rate - Personal Loan question,"Hi PF,

I have student loans as many people who graduate college do now a day.  I'm ok with making the minimum payments and do my best to budget out and pay more principal every month that I can.  I have met my match for my 401k with my employer every year and when I meet that match I reduce my 401k contribution in order to pay off the higher interest rate. 

I have about $30k in student loans total now. 

One is through my university that is in my name and on my credit and is only a few grand at 5% with small monthly payment.

One is through my mom with a parent+loan(this one does not show up on my credit, but my mom's and I pay it every month - 7.99%) -About 10k.

One is several subsidized loans for about $20k that has avg interest rate of 6.5%

My idea is to payoff all of these loans with a personal loan or something similar so I can pay one lump sum at a lower interest rate.  I'm not sure of any other types of loans and haven't really done much research as I wanted to reach out here for some guidance.   

Thanks!",finance,1447431160
investing,ELI5: Why did KB Home get such a massive tax subsidy in 2014?,"I was revieving their [2014 statements](http://investor.kbhome.com/financials-Statements.cfm) and I noticed that their line for income taxes said ""-823.40M"", resulting in almost 90% of its income. All of this benefit seems to have been acknowledged in the fourth quarter, which I would assume means they received a massive subsidy from the federal government. However, after a bit of research I couldn't really figure anything out that made obvious sense, and I also didn't notice any significant increase in stock price after the income jump.

What does this mean for KB Home? I believe they're still a big player in home construction, but is it safe to invest? Is this another 2007, where they'll collapse and lose almost all market cap in another recession? Is this a government bubble? Is it safe to invest in?",finance,1447431417

Eventually went to a community college,  after 3 years there transferred to a state school for 2 years, my major had changed about 4 times so I never had enough relevant credits to graduate in any major.

worldpolitics,Saudi Arabia: a Kingdom Stumble - by Conn Hallinan,"For the past eight decades Saudi Arabia has been careful.

Using its vast oil wealth, it has quietly spread its ultra-conservative brand of Islam throughout the Muslim world, secretly undermined secular regimes in its region and prudently kept to the shadows, while others did the fighting and dying. It was Saudi money that fueled the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan, underwrote Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Iran, and bankrolled Islamic movements and terrorist groups from the Caucuses to Hindu Kush.

Today that circumspect diplomacy is in ruins, and the House of Saud looks more vulnerable than it has since the country was founded in 1926. Unraveling the reasons for the current train wreck is a study in how easily hubris, illusion, and old-fashioned ineptness can trump even bottomless wealth.

The Kingdom’s first stumble was a strategic decision last fall to undermine competitors by upping oil production and, thus, lowering the price.  Their reasoning was that, if the price of a barrel of oil dropped from over $100 to around $80, it would strangle competition from more expensive sources and new technologies, including the U.S. fracking industry, the arctic, and emergent producers like Brazil. That, in turn, would allow Riyadh to reclaim its shrinking share of the energy market.

There was also the added benefit that lower oil prices would damage countries that the Saudis didn’t like: Russia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Iran.

In one sense it worked. The American fracking industry is scaling back, the exploitation of Canada’s oil sands has slowed, and many arctic drillers closed up shop. And, indeed, countries like Venezuela, Ecuador, and Russia took a serious economic hit. But despite obvious signs, the Saudis failed to anticipate China’s economic slowdown and how that would dampen economic growth in the leading industrial nations. The price of oil went from $115 a barrel in June 2014 to $44 today. Because it is so pure, it costs less than $10 to produce a barrel of Saudi oil.

The Kingdom planned to use its almost $800 billion in financial reserves to ride out the drop in prices, but it figured that oil would not fall below $80 a barrel, and then only for a few months.

According to the Financial Times, in order to balance its budget, Saudi Arabia needs a price of between $95 and $105 a barrel. And while oil prices will likely rise over the next five years, projections are that price per barrel will only reach $65. Saudi debt is on schedule to rise from 6.7 percent of GDP this year to 17.3 percent next year, and its 2015 budget deficit is $130 billion.

Saudi Arabia is spending $10 billion a month in foreign exchange reserves to pay the bills and has been forced to borrow money on the international financial market. Two weeks ago the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) regional director, Masood Ahmed, warned Riyadh that the country would deplete its financial reserves in five years unless it drastically cut its budget.

But the Kingdom can’t do that.

When the Arab Spring broke out in 2011, the Saudi Arabia headed it off by pumping $130 billion into the economy, raising wages, improving services and providing jobs for its growing population. Saudi Arabia has one of the youngest populations in the Middle East, a lot of it unemployed and much of it poorly educated. Some 25 percent of the population lives in poverty. Money keeps the lid on, but for how long, even with the heavy-handed repression that characterizes Saudi political life?

In March, the Kingdom intervened in Yemen, launching an air war, a naval blockade, and partial ground campaign on the pretense that Iran was behind the civil war, a conclusion not even the Americans agree with.

Again, the Saudis miscalculated, even though one of its major allies, Pakistan, warned Riyadh that it was headed for trouble. In part, the Kingdom’s hubris was fed by the illusion that U.S. support would make it a short war—the Americans are arming the Saudis, supplying them with bombing targets, backing up the naval blockade, and refueling their warplanes in mid-air.

But six months down the line the conflict has turned into a stalemate. The war has killed 5,000 people, including 500 children, flattened cities, and alienated much of the local population. It has also generated a food and medical crisis, as well as creating opportunities for the IS and Al-Qaeda to seize territory in Southern Yemen.  Efforts by the UN to investigate the possibility of war crimes were blocked by Saudi Arabia and the U.S.

As the Saudis are finding out, war is a very expensive business, a burden the Saudis could meet under normal circumstances, but not when the price the Kingdom’s only commodity, oil, is plummeting.

Nor is Yemen the only war that the Saudis are involved with. Riyadh, along with other Gulf monarchies, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, are underwriting many of the groups trying to overthrow Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. When anti-government demonstrations broke out in 2011, the Saudis—along with the Americans and the Turks—calculated that Assad could be toppled in a few months.

But that was magical thinking. As bad as Assad is, a lot of Syrians, particularly minorities like Shiites, Christians, and Druze, were far more afraid of the Islamists from al-Qaeda and the IS then they were of their own government. So the war has dragged on for four years and has now killed close to 250,000 people.

Once again, the Saudis miscalculated, though in this case they were hardly alone. The Syrian government turned out to be more resilient that it appeared. And Riyadh’s bottom line that Assad had to go just ended up bringing Iran and Russia into the picture, checkmating any direct intervention by the anti-Assad coalition. Any attempt to establish a no-fly zone will have to confront the Russian air force, not something that anyone other than U.S. presidential aspirants are eager to do.

The war has also generated a flood of refugees, deeply alarming the European Union, which finally seems to be listening to Moscow’s point about the consequences of overthrowing governments without a plan as to who takes over. There is nothing like millions of refugees headed in your direction to cause some serious re-thinking of strategic goals.

The Saudis goal of isolating Iran is rapidly collapsing. The P5+1—The U.S., China, Russia, Great Britain, France, and Germany—successfully completed a nuclear agreement with Teheran, despite every effort by the Saudis and Israel to torpedo it. And at Moscow’s insistence, Washington has reversed its opposition to Iran being included in peace talks around Syria.

Stymied in Syria, mired down in Yemen, its finances increasingly fragile, the Kingdom also faces internal unrest from its long marginalized Shiia minority in the country’s east and south. To top it off, the IS has called for the “liberation” of Mecca from the House of Saud and launched a bombing campaign aimed at the Kingdom’s Shiites.

Last month’s Hajj disaster that killed more than 2100 pilgrims—and anger at the Saudi authorities foot dragging on investigating the tragedy—have added to the royal family’s woes. The Saudi’s claim 769 people were killed, a figure that no other country in the world accepts. And there are persistent rumors that the deadly stampede was caused when police blocked off an area in order to allow high-ranking Saudis special access to the holy sites.

Some of these missteps can be laid at the feet of the new king, Salman bin Abud-Aziz Al Saud, and of a younger generation of aggressive Saudis he has appointed to key positions. But Saudi Arabia’s troubles are also a reflection of a Middle East in transition. Exactly where that it is headed is by no means clear, but change is in the wind.

Iran is breaking out of its isolation and, with its large, well-educated population, strong industrial base, and plentiful energy resources, is poised to play a major regional, if not international, role. Turkey is in the midst of a political upheaval, and there is growing opposition among Turks to Ankara’s meddling in the Syrian civil war

Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is impaled on its own policies, both foreign and domestic. “The expensive social contract between the Royal family and Saudi citizens will get more difficult, and eventually impossible to sustain if oil prices don’t recover,” Meghan L. O’Sullivan, director of the Geopolitics of Energy project at Harvard told the New York Times.

However, the House of Saud has little choice but to keep pumping oil to pay for its wars and keep the internal peace. But more production drives down prices even further, and, once the sanctions come off of Iran, the oil glut will become worse.

While it is still immensely wealthy, there are lots of bills coming due. It is not clear the Kingdom has the capital or the ability to meet them.

personalfinance,Opening a Roth IRA before the end of the year to take advantage of a low-tax situation vs paying down a student loan with a similar rate,"For context, I'm a 22yo recent college grad. Here are the numbers:

Debt:

* A private student loan of $30k at 6.97% fixed. ~$240/mo payment.

* A federal consolidated loan of $32.2k at 4.25% fixed. ~$140/mo payment on my IBR plan, I make the $205/mo standard plan payment.

* Two credit cards, both rarely used and immediately paid off. $0.

Savings:

* $9.2k saved, including $6k set aside as an emergency fund and never touched.

* Monthly expenses are roughly $2k (including loan payments), monthly income after tax is roughly $2.5k.


Here's where things get interesting:

I'm traveling through Europe, working remotely for an American company. I'm considered an itinerant by the IRS, so (unless something catastrophic happens* and I have to go home) I will qualify for the foreign income exclusion for part of this year and beyond, which means I'm not subject to income tax (just self-employment tax at 15.3%) for the time I'm out of the country. This makes maxing out a Roth IRA contribution each year that I'm gone very tempting, because I'm paying little to no tax on either end.

I've already paid my lodging through the end of February and will be redeeming various rebates and cash back earnings soon, so I'll have roughly $5.5k in extra savings by the beginning of March that I can use to max out my 2015 Roth contribution before the April deadline. Then, sometime in the spring, I'll hit 330 days abroad and will qualify for the income exclusion, resulting in a roughly $4k return of overpaid taxes from this year. This can knock out most of the 2016 contribution, and I'll effectively go from $0 in my retirement fund to almost $10k within a few months. Then I'll continue paying in monthly to hit the 2016 cap.

-OR-

I can put all of that on my private loan, knocking out roughly a third of it. The rate is close to the 7% people say you can expect long-term from the market (which is the game I'd be playing), and the psychological factor is a pretty even split for me.

So what's the rule of thumb when the rules of thumb don't help?

*In this case, I can buy a (max) $2k same-week plane ticket to my parents', where I can stay with no expenses while I get back on my feet. The rest of the emergency fund would cover roughly 10 months of loan payments. So even in a worst-case scenario that doesn't involve serious bodily harm (I bought RTW health insurance for that), my current emergency fund will hold me.",finance,1447438221

Bitcoin,An BIG opportunity for Bitcoin....,"There was a great opinion piece written on how BTC can help the daily fantasy industry - a billion dollars industry - but first....

Backstory:
This week the NY Attorney General sent a cease and desist letter to the 2 big daily fantasy sites (DFS) - Draftkings and Fanduel - saying that it is gambling, a scourge on society, and a scam. 

Whether u cant stand the carpet bombing of commercials or think it's a game of chance/skill, is a discussion for another time. U see both DK and FD have decided to fight the AG,  and will have their day in court. Meanwhile and legally they will continue to operate and allow NYers to play as they assert that fantasy sports is legal under the provision in the federal UIGE act (the law that banned online poker/gambling) which is how they've been able to operate so far. Imo the State wants in on the action to get their beaks wet with their homegrown casinos, so shut down the innovators, sound familiar?

The AG has pressured the payment processors to stop allowing deposits and FD as of right now stopped accepting deposits from NY. There are somewhere between 500,000 and 1 mil NYers who play at these sites. 

Opportunity:
It seems like a huge opportunity for a Coinbase, Circle, etc to provide their services show FD how easily it is to accept, utilize and if need be convert BTC. Possibly bringing thousands into the BTC fold. FD and DK can incentivize people to deposit BTC w free entry tickets into the million dollar tournament ($20) or one of their many tourneys. 

A lot of these DFSers aren't enjoying being told what they can and can't do with their hard earned money, and starting to realize they're only as free as their crony elected officials allow them to be.

I checked game cache in steam and it was fine.  I've turned AA and some other stuff off and it's still crashing.  I'm at the town just across the river from your home town.  (can't remember the name now that I'm out of the game)

Immediately after these crashes, I went and played four hours of Bioshock Infinite at 3840x2160 with absolute maximum graphics settings including AA.  Not a single crash, and the frames stayed near 100.

Specs:

5930k @ 4.4 ghz (cooled with H110)

32GB ram

Samsung XP941 M.2 SSD (gets like 1.4 GB/s sequential download)

2x EVGA SC GTX 980 TI ACX 2.0 in SLi

Any ideas?  I'm 90% sure it's the game and not my computer because I do video rendering in adobe premiere a couple times a week (with GPU acceleration) that goes on for several hours, and it never crashes.  I do lots of gaming outside of fallout and it never crashes.  I've been prime95 stable for 24+ hrs.  Plus, I played four hours of Bioshock Infinite immediately after I got fed up with fallout 4 crashing.

OH one important thing to mention: I have SLi set to ""Force alternate frame rendering 2"" in driver settings because they didn't release the game with an SLi profile and it was only using one video card, and considering I play on a 4K monitor, I really need both cards to get playable framerates.

personalfinance,Pay down credit cards or keep reserve fund?,I've recently purchased a house and have come to realize just how much is needed during these times. I've built up a considerable amount of credit card debt. I have about 3400 in cash in a savings account. My credit card debt is about 6000.

Bitcoin,Atop on Blythe Masters,"&gt;That presentation was a stunning demonstration of hubris, nativism, hegemony, privilege and authoritarianism as I have ever seen. It reveals a world view in which the only part of the world that matters is the western developed world. The only economy that matters is the stock market. The only power that exists is that of the state and it is all-good, all-powerful and must not be questioned. It is a worldview in which might makes right and Masters is aligned with the top of the power pyramid and could therefore not be more ""right"". She smugly ignores the crimes of her fellow bankers as she supports further crime, such as negative interest rates, without any moral hesitation. Just as Masters called us all ""bitcoin maximalists"", she demonstrated what a ""state maximalist"" looks like. It was ugly and pathetic. 


&gt;Fortunately, the world is bigger than the UK and US trading floors that Masters lives in. It contains countries that have constitutions (unlike the UK) and countries that do not believe in nor will accept western hegemony. The world contains 3 billion people with no banking, who won't let any government or banker stand in the way of securing the financial future of their children, if given that chance. Another 3 billion are underbanked, currency controlled and living under terrible governments.

&gt;""Since different countries and jurisdictions have little uniformity on how bitcoin and digital currency is regulated, scammers will take advantage of the confusion and contradictions to misinform potential investors.""

&gt;- Gerald Rome, Colorado Securities Commissioner

I don't feel we need to create investor protection regulation targeting specific industries, but it's hard to argue with these points. Crooks love to start fraudulent bitcoin startups, because it is a convenient way to steal money from consumers and also investors. Money is often held in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, which can be stolen electronically and is irreversible.

Also, many entrepreneurs are good at creating software, but are completely out of their depth building financial technology. Payments fraud, regulation, compliance, these subjects have entire industries around them because of their complexity. Look for teams with long backgrounds in financial services building products to avoid issues here. If you are investing in bitcoin startups, or even using a service offered by one, always look for teams that have a professional reputation to uphold as well.

Once you have $2k in the plan, they allow you to choose an investment fund rather than just passive 0.01% interest rates. 

I ideally wanted to click the vanguard institutional index fund and be done with it. 0.02% expense ratio, passive gains, seems great. The problem though, is that under myhealthequity this qualifies as an ""investor choice"" plan, so they charge a 0.1% per quarter administrative fee.

Obviously with a 5 year term I'm looking at over 3k/month in payments, which could be tight but I could do it.

personalfinance,"My husband's father has a history of controlling my husband's finances, edging on abuse of his credit. He still occasionally tries to log in to one online account or another. What all do we need to protect and be aware of? [x-post /r/legaladvice]","My husband is 24. Until the last couple of years, his parents managed all of his student loans and other finances, and my husband (believe me, I know this was naivete on his part) trusted this, and while he tried to get details, he ultimately settled for vague answers. Thanks in part to my somewhat more informed involvement, much has come out about his history with my husband's finances and credit, and his father's behavior has escalated somewhat.

Overview examples:
- A few years ago, he advised my husband to open his own credit card so that he (the father) could borrow the entire limit amount himself, then promptly began to deny the occurrence and claims he doesn't remember it. The father paid off the interest every month on the card for a while, then abandoned this and essentially declared it my husband's problem.
- Most recently, we got an email from Nelnet (the portal we both have for our Federal loans) from a password reset request, and we know neither of us attempted to do it, and we know that my husband's father created the (aggravatingly unchangeable) username, and it's based on his usual ones and he's the only other person who knows it. Something like this happens roughly every couple of months. He's not crafty or clever about any of this, and he has no idea how to avoid leaving a trail, but he does make attempts.

Anyway, my husband has eliminated contact with them except for the most minimally necessary occasional text from his mother, and has changed passwords on everything he can and taken general control of his accounts. However, **we would like some opinions about what else we should be watching out for, and any official avenues we should take for protecting his/our information from his father.** My husband's father and mother are experiencing significant financial strain right now (the father's client retention for his financial advisement business is just terrible, for some strange reason ... and the mother quite frankly refuses to see any of this, at all), so we're concerned that his quasi-rationalized attempts to get involved in everything may mature into outright blatant fraud. He has, of course, copies of virtually everything about my husband and knows all his information.

**Separate-ish question about bankruptcy and student loan ... fraud? Is it fraud? I don't know:** We're going to be declaring bankruptcy soon. We're freshly in a spare room somewhere after being homeless for a period (ever since very abruptly leaving his parents' home with no time for a backup plan), and we have steady small income but are generally broke, and I screwed up my credit when I was young and stupid, and his credit is screwed by the aforementioned credit card and his student loans (he knew nothing about their various statuses until the last year or so). Now, to be sure, we have no intention of attempting to discharge our various federal loans, because those are easy to defer/forebear and handle other ways and we care about paying them back. However, around half of his loans, we've discovered, are private predatory loans to which my husband is 99% sure he never personally consented.

The thing is, we're quite certain that he would adamantly have insisted on taking time off from school to work rather than consent to those. His father had a major complex about forcing my husband to finish school, to the point where when my husband needed a semester off, he had to give the ultimatum that he would either take a semester off or commit suicide in order to get his parents would consent to it. We think that his father knew my husband wouldn't consent to desperate measures with predatory loans (the assumption being that he would get a high-paying job, of course, because we all know how guaranteed that is) and we're fairly sure that these were taken out covertly. We understand that legally he was supposed to be involved with all of his school financial aid processes -- in fact, towards his final year, when things got really weird, the school financial aid advisor began making sure to talk to my husband personally and informed him when his father asked weird questions. However, back when I met him, his father was always in his email accounts, bank accounts, everything, so that's how all arrangements were made. I recognize, though, that the issue of ""consent"" here is tricky, since my husband allowed himself to be ignorant about this and let his father handle things up to a certain point.

We've also-also determined that a significant minority of his total student loan debt was spent personally by his parents. He always transferred his disbursement surplus to them, and accepted a very small living allowance from them, always with a heap of insistence that there wasn't enough. He dealt drugs all through college to handle basic living expenses. (I think that should be thrown in their face, but we're past that window and he doesn't want to tell them, so that's okay.) Anyway, we've done the math, and it seems like as much as 30% of his student loan debt may have been personally spent by his parents, after we account for what actually paid tuition/fees and what money he was actually allowed to use for rent, books, and survival. Anyway, from my research, it sounds like sometimes private loans can be discharged when they would present an unreasonable burden to pay (to that end, they're $700 a month, he's making about $1100 a month right now and we've just settled in a new location after having been homeless so I'm just now finding work again) -- but also it seems that the way in which the loan money was spent can be relevant, like if parts of it weren't actually spent on the relevant degree. Does anyone know what our situation looks like in terms of a reason for discharging some of those private loans? He's long since had no deferment or forebearance options left on them because they're extremely limited, and they'll ruin our credit for years if they don't get handled somehow or if one of us doesn't score amazing income by some miracle. Any advice on this would be welcome.

I am 24 years old and have one credit card with Bank of America (which I do all my banking with), it's at around a 9% or 10% interest fee and I have $1800 maximum credit line (but I believe this will be increased shortly as I have applied for an increase and it looks like it will probably be approved).

I pay my minimum balance monthly AT LEAST, but usually pay it off 100% with the exception of the last 3 months (because of a big purchase). Currently I have a few hundred dollars to pay which I should clear by the end of the year.

Now, I'm very interested in building my credit as much as possible without overdoing it or signing up for too much responsibility. I've read that after having this credit card for a few years and paying it off regularly and on time, it may be a good time for me to apply for another card. Now... my question is...

Would it be a good idea for me to apply for credit line at another bank, the same bank (bank of america), or an online or retail line (amazon, etc)???

I've been told that my interest rate is already very low compared to other cards at Bank of America, and aside from getting a business card it doesn't look like I'll benefit much.

I believe it is about time that Tesla's and/or Musk's claims stopped being taken as law. The inability to keep on schedule is something which has had me disappointed with Tesla in the past, and it's something that current shareholders seem overwhelmingly okay with ignoring.

Let's look at the track record. I'll fill in the timeline as much as I can, but I'd love if others could contribute. I'll add them as we go along:

***

**2008:**

 - ""Tesla Motors, an electric car start-up in Silicon Valley, said Wednesday that it would lay off employees and delay production of its second car, the Model S"" ([Source, Oct. 2008](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/technology/start-ups/16tesla.html?_r=0))

 ***

 - ""Mr. Musk posted the changes on Tesla’s Web site. He said the company was in a “critical phase” and would have a positive cash flow within nine months."" ([Source, Oct. 2008](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/technology/start-ups/16tesla.html?_r=0)) 

I may be wrong, but I believe Tesla still has yet to reach a positive cash flow, although they do sound confident that it's on the horizon.

***

**2009:**

 - ""Apparently, a number of Roadster reservation holders who had already placed hefty deposits (as much as $50,000 dollars) on the Tesla, had locked in their orders and picked their options recently received letters and phone calls informing them that they were unlocked from their orders and their spot in the line was in jeopardy if they didn't re-option their rides."" ([Source, Jan. 2009](http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/20/tesla-raises-prices-on-roadster-options-sparks-controversy-ang/))

Basically, the Roadster was sold with loads of options included in the price, then Tesla told buyers they needed to pay extra for those options or lose their place in the queue. Here's a quote by buyer #395 from [another article](http://forcechange.com/1881/bad-pr-tesla-forces-pre-ordered-roadster-owners-to-pay-more/): 

""I am [pre-ordered owner] number 395. I am not a rich person dabbling in a plaything. I thought I was actually doing some good by supporting a company that was moving us to a more sustainable future. I put $50,000 of my own money down on this car in May of 2007. I withstood the delays. I held in there when it almost seemed the company was going bankrupt. Now, after locking in my options, they pull this on me. Elon Musk does not understand the power of evangelicals to the cause. Steve Jobs does. The same power that can bring people to the cause can turn the same power in a 180 degree turn against the cause. From this day forward, that’s what I’m going to do.""

This is really interesting, because people love to talk about how early Tesla buyers were all so rich they didn't care about the price bump. This proves those claims wrong.

***

**2010:**

 - CEO Elon Musk is now saying he expects to launch the Model S sedan “within two and a half years.” [Source, Jan, 2010](http://sfcitizen.com/blog/2010/01/15/yet-another-delay-for-telsa-motors-model-s-coming-in-850-days-or-so-maybe/)

The base MSRP was also claimed to start at $49,900. The price was later raised and the current base price for a Model S is $70,000 before incentives and savings. That's a 40% increase. If you were to apply that same increase based on percentage, the Model 3 would not start at $35,000 as Tesla leads the media to believe, but much closer to $49,000.


***

**2011:**

 - ""Three battery options are offered: 160-, 230-, or 300-mile range. Model S comes standard with the 160-mile range battery at the quoted $49,900 base price (after the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit). The 230-mile and 300-mile range batteries are optional upgrades. The 230-mile range option is priced at about $10,000 more than the base and the 300-mile option at about $20,000 more than the base."" ([Source, Aug. 2011](http://acarisnotarefrigerator.com/2011/08/04/tesla-readies-the-model-s/), scroll to where it says, ""Ownership and Pricing"")

This would mean the pricing goes as $49,900, $59,900, and $69,900. This is very inaccurate. The base Model S with a 70KwH, 230 mile range starts at $70,000. The Model S 85KwH Dual motor starts at $85,000 and is the closest to 300 miles of range. It starts at $15,000 more than the original claimed number, with less range.

**2012:**

 - ""The seven-passenger Model X promises to be more versatile and family-friendly than the Model S, and will double the size of Tesla’s current U.S. lineup when it eventually goes on sale sometime in early 2015."" ([Source, Feb. 2012](http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2015-tesla-model-x-photos-and-info-news)) It is late 2015, and only a handful have been delivered.

It is November of 2015 and we have yet to even see a rendering, so one could easily draw the conclusion that it won't happen this year. 

***

**2013:**

- ""Tesla SEC filing reveals Model X electric SUV production delayed until 2014"" ([Source, Mar. 2013](http://www.torquenews.com/1075/tesla-sec-filing-reveals-model-x-electric-suv-production-delayed-until-2014))

Yet, here we are at the late end of 2015 and only a handful have been delivered. There were no deliveries in 2014. At this time, you cannot even access a configurator unless you're an early reservation holder.

**2014:**

 - Tesla Confirms Model X Arrival For Early 2015 ([Source, Jun. 2014](http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/06/tesla-model-x-launch-date/))

Delayed. As has been said, we're in late 2015 with only a handful of deliveries. 

***

**2015:**

 - ""On Tuesday, Tesla will deliver the company's first Model X SUVs to customers. By doing so, CEO Elon Musk will make good on a promise to get the Model X to market in the third quarter."" 

Wrong.

It merely made a handful of them for the sole purpose of pretending they were ready.

- Let's say my program is sitting with the start state of a chess board, and doesn't know any tactics/strategies, it only knows the rules of chess, and that own piece elimination or own loss is bad, and opponent's piece elimination, and opponent's loss is good.
- It knows it has to make a move decision out of the 20 (or whatever) possible first moves.
- Since it doesn't know any move being better than any other move, all moves are ""equally valuable"".
- ""Equally valuable"" gives the first clue that we should perhaps assign ""probability"" to each move. So 1/20 to each move. And that the learning process should adjust these probabilities so that the next time the program starts a new game, not all moves are equally valued (have equal move probability) and either the move with highest prob. is picked, or a move is picked by sampling the probability distribution of moves.

So my question is, what kind of learning algorithm helps with updating these probabilities? how is it different if the probability is updated every time a piece (own or opponent's) is eliminated, vs, updating probabilities at the end of a win or loss, vs, a combination of those? finally, how can a ""hierarchical"" probability model is built such that, there are probabilities assigned to, not only each move, but to each tactic (which themselves are learned not fed), as well as each strategy (which also is learned).

I guess it would be a combination of ""reinforcement learning"", ""hierarchical bayesian modeling"", and so on. But I'd appreciate, if anyone can point out specific resource for this kind of approach (not necessarily for chess, but preferably for a combinatorial problem, not things like images, signals, etc).

Also please note that I'm somewhat aware of typical approaches for chess programs (graph search, hard coding openings, end-games etc), I'm not looking for those approaches. (I guess I'm looking for a method that would most mimic the way a human chess newbie learns and improves. Though part of chess training includes ""explicit"" learning of many tactics, strategies, openings, and end games; let's say I want to ignore that for this simple learning approach).

Thanks in advance.",technology,1447564884

personalfinance,"Credit bureaus now let consumers upload supporting documentation online, which can help get errors removed quickly.","This could be extremely helpful for anyone trying to handle disputes on their credit reports. New York Times reports:

“Now that you can upload documents, it allows for a more robust dispute online,” said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. The center previously warned consumers against using the bureaus’ online dispute systems, but it now says that it can be a viable option for those who want to have errors removed quickly.

Errors in credit reports are a problem because they may lower your credit score, the three-digit number that serves as a summary of your credit history. That can possibly result in a higher interest rate on a loan or even denial of credit. A study by the Federal Trade Commission in 2012 found that about a quarter of consumers had errors in their credit reports. A smaller proportion — about 5 percent — had errors that could significantly lower their credit scores, but that still means millions of people are affected.

personalfinance,Investing in bonds even with current rates (US)?,"Given the historically low and even negative bond rates in places, is it still a wise choice to invest in bonds (or a bond mutual fund) given the low rates, or is an online high-interest savings account just as good a place to diversify away from the stock market? If I was thinking of putting a good chunk of money (several 10's of thousands) in bonds, would it be better to wait until after the expected Fed rate increase in December?

*Some back story*: I didn't start saving until after the 2008 crash (still in my 20's) and have only known near-zero and negative bond yields in my investing life. I've had about 60% of my savings  in a few low-cost stock index funds, and much of the rest (above and beyond a very healthy emergency fund) sitting in a high-interest online savings account. I figured this was preferable to investing in bonds since the latter's yields are so low. I've been reading more about investing lately and am wondering if that was the right decision, and if now would be a good time to correct it. With the coming rise in interests rates, would it be better to wait until after December to put a lot of money in bonds, if I was going to do that? FWIW, I am also in a pretty unusual job situation and am likely to be using a lot of this money to purchase an apartment in early 2017.",finance,1447601629

My dilemma is that at I will be very close to zero at the end of next year.  A single emergency or miscalculation could put me into debt very easily.  Also being at zero would really limit my options and flexibility at the end of my masters.

So it seems that I should take out student loans at some point just to retain flexibility, but the %5 interest rate is pretty high.  What do you recommend?

Can anyone ELI5 the value of the mortgage interest deduction?  I own a house (well bank owns, and i pay mortgage) - I've owned my house for alittle more than 2 years (so still early in the payment, and most of money is going into paying off interest)

I recently tabulated all of my expenses and am finding I am paying about 14k in interest expenses this year. I pay about 27% into various income taxes - is the value simply calculated as 14k*.27% ? (edit: family of 3, and schedule A deductions ~48k last year)

I currently have a lump sum of savings that ive been waiting to put into the market (put a few K in everytime it drops x %, yea yea, timing the market etc) or other investment opportunity (possible investment property downpayment, but am on the fence). edit: my mortgage interest rate is about 3.875%, which is fairly good, unfortunately my market returns are less than that for the duration of my mortgage. 

The lump sum would allow me to cut my reduce my mortgage principal by about 1/3 - so I am trying to figure out the real benefit of reducing my principal vs. the potential return for other investments (which have yet to materialize). 

FWIW, i am already putting an extra $$$ to prepaying the mortgage, putting a fixed amount into it so that the principal pay down is atleast the same as the amount im putting into interest.",finance,1447616800
personalfinance,"$146,000 in the hole, could use some help...","Hi there. I'm writing this on behalf of my gf who is $146K in debt between student loans and credit cards. We live together and split rent/utilities/food, but keep the rest of our finances separate. 

While I am debt free and have several thousand in the bank, we need some advice on how she can tackle this monstrosity between our split costs and her monthly income. Here we go...

Credit Card #1 has 30% interest, $294 minimum monthly and a $8,845.97 balance.

Credit Card #2 has 12% interest, $222 minimum monthly and a $11,081.15 balance.

Credit Card #3 has 13% interest, $90 minimum monthly and a $4,400 balance.

Credit Card #4 has 0% interest, $63 minimum monthly and a $4,354.90 balance.

Great Lakes Student Loan has 6% interest, $93 minimum monthly and a $45,962.12 balance.

Federal Student Loan has 6% interest, $303 minimum monthly and a $44,602 balance.

Car loan is 2% interest, $550 minimum monthly and a $26,800 balance.

Total debt is $146,046.14.

Budget: She spends $500 a month on rent+utilities (we split roughly $1,000 together) and $150 a month on her phone.

Her monthly income ranges from $2,400-$4,000 but on average is $3,300.

She works as a Nutrition Specialist at a luxury/spa resort and her income fluctuates due to commission and busy season.

Her minimum monthly payments/car payments/rent/phone add up to $2,265. If, on average, she's taking home $3,300 a month, that leaves her with $1,035 leftover each month for food, savings and activities.

She only has about $200 saved right now and we both know this could be better. We are working on being frugal together but the anxiety created by all this debt had an impact on her spending habits before we started seeing each other. I'm reaching out now to see how we can fix this but I know this amount of debt seems insurmountable...we really just need some direction, a starting point.

We are trying to be frugal with our food budget and both love to cook, but being involved with nutrition means that we spend a little more for healthy/organic foods. We are budgeting $400 a month each ($100 a week per person) for food, so that takes her $1,035 a month down to $635 on average, depending on commission and time of year. Is this a reasonable food budget for our healthy accommodations? 

She keeps receiving these debt consolidation mailings and is considering them, but they reek of payday loan scams.

She has tried to get a debt consolidation through her local credit union but they couldn't help her out. 

Questions: 

1. Is it even worth seeking a debt consolidation? I don't know much about them and I understand it largely depends on the interest rates that are offered. Again, the ones that she receives in the mail seem like a total scam.

2. What is the best approach for tackling these credit cards/loan payments? Logically, we think it makes sense to pay off the higher-interest credit cards first but I've read it may be psychologically easier to create little victories by paying off the lower-interest loans first.

3. We live in a sprawled-out town and at the moment, her car is a necessity. I am in between jobs and depending on where I become employed, we may be able to get rid of her car and just use mine. Is this something worth considering if we can manage it? How big of an impact would this have in the grand scheme of her overall debt?

Anyways, the car is depreciating faster than I can pay it off and right now, it's worth about as much as I owe ($8k).. My credit ranges around 590-630. I actually missed a payment about 1.5 years ago(a problem with my bank and payment didn't go through- still my fault).  I've been current ever since and I have no problem paying the monthly payments.  I'd like to get out from under this car..   It's in decent shape now but I foresee some things falling apart soon.  I make 50k/yr and I can afford a pretty high monthly payment (low rent/no family/ etc..)  I'd like to get a 4x4 truck since that's what I had previously and I will need something for snow.  I figure that I can trade it in but for lower than $8k so I'd have to roll the difference of the loan...  What are my chances of even getting approved, and if I can get approved, what kind of rate am I looking at?

Bank promised to cover my credit card by putting rest of it on personal loan with low interest but now are not getting back to me.,"Hey guys I could use some guidance

I worked for a small tech company the last 4 years and was used to making about $3000 a month. It was part-time work and I had a music career I was pursuing so I needed a flexible schedule and was willing to put up with lower pay.  Now the company has suddenly taking a dive and I'm making an income of about $1000 a month. I also experienced some mental health problems around the same time (due to overstress) and had to spend some money on medication and care to get back to where I am. My credit card has a 16.64% interest rate and a balance of -$13,168. About 2 years ago I took out a low interest personal loan (That is at -$3,566.) from Wells Fargo to completely pay off my credit card, my thoughts were my income would increase and I could pay off debt on lower interest. Cue the mental health issue and I completely lost track of everything and just had to put all care onto the card. I have literally no idea how it as $13000 after two years but again I was working on mental health and could not focus on anything but that. It scares me that it got away from me so much. I also have a Navient student loan at -$3,241 as well. Basically with Rent at 500, one personal loan at 250 and my credit card payments at 250 I have no way to do this. I have made a budget and without any room for anything but the basics my budget is $1237 a month. Which is basically what I make with grandma's help. I have gotten food stamps, sold all my clothes/instruments/moved to a cheaper part of town/stopped eating out as well as picked up freelance jobs when I can but I am getting very close to not being able to make payments. I have sent out countless job applications over the past month but I haven't heard back.

personalfinance,Personal loan vs credit and savings for a move,"Long story short, our timeline of 6 months to move (which would put us at 0 credit debt and 12K for moving expenses) is now 6 weeks. 

I am 36, my husband is 40, we have a combined income of 150K but have very little in savings and live close to pay check to pay check due to my medical problems, and my student loan plus the high cost of living areas for rent. We both have excellent credit ratings. We have both been unemployed in the last 3 years, and work in industries that this could happen again. 

We are moving cross country back to NYC,  and expect the following expenses: 
- 8k cash just to get an apartment (first, last, security deposit)
- 5K moving expenses (truck/gas/hotel/food or movers/shipping--it comes in around 4000-5000, we'd perfer not to drive it and take off 
- 2K buffer  (this isn't our first trip to the cross country rodeo) 

We have:
- a car we are selling that is financed, which will be sold closer to the move date, in hopes we get close to what is left on the loan but we may owe a small amount (i feel ok with paying this balance from the nest egg)
- 3K saved we can use for the move 
- 23K nest egg from the sale of a house 2 years ago--this is all the money we have in savings and are hoping to purchase again in the next 2 years
- 80K in student loan debt 
- 401K which doesn't have a lot in it, and we don't want to touch at all
- 7K left in credit debt (we have paid off 10K since summer knowing a move is coming)
- monthly medical expenses around 1K mth, which we pay in cash monthly what we we have 7K in credit debt 

The options I see are: 
- personal loan of 20K, (with an fixed APR less than credit cards) which has a lower interest rate, will clear out our credit debt and pay for the move, 5 year mtly payment around $400, we can likely pay it off faster than  years
- personal loan for 12K (with an fixed APR less than credit cards) which will cover the credit debt, move and unexpected expenses, and we'll need to use 6K from our nest egg and give us one nice monthly payment, 3 year mthly payment around $400
- charge the move, expenses putting credit debt back to 14-15K, and take 6K from the nest egg (interest on the cards we have are between 11.5-14.6%) 
- pay for move/apt fees/misc in cash from the nest egg, and keep paying credit cards as planned, leaving next egg at 10K, and rebuild the egg once the credit debt is paid off (this feels like the most risk to me since we have had hard times the last few years, losing this money feels wrong, and like we won't ever be able to rebuild it)

* She suspects come closing time he will try and get ~100k from the sale. He has put in MAYBE 20-30k total materials + labor. That would be a generous estimate, and most of it is for sub-par materials and illegal migrant labor that 80%+ of which will need to be redone. He keeps no receipts and pays his workers in cash off the books to avoid taxes, and since most of his materials are free or recycled he likely won't have proof of any cost or work done other than him saying, ""It cost me ~100k to do all this.""

* She would prefer to either sell as-is ASAP since the project is long overdue, or try and buy her business partner out of her half of the property and finish the work with her own contractors. (MIL has flipped several houses before.)


As my MIL was telling us all this yesterday she also said she really wants my wife and I to own the home if she's able to buy her business partner's share. (Something she's wanted for us for our first home.) This may look like an outright gift or us taking out a small mortgage for her original share of the property investment. Obviously this gives us an even more vested interest aside from helping her out.

Yes, I know my MIL is a huge pushover and has made some very poor decisions up until this point. But how can my wife and I help her, and ourselves if we buy the property later or are gifted it, from getting screwed down the line by this situation?

personalfinance,Most time/cost effective way to pay ~9000 in Credit Card debt - Weighing my options,"Here is a quick breakdown of my personal finances;    

Approximate Net Income(Monthly) - $3600  
Student Loan Debt - ~34k(2 loans 6-8%)  
Car Loan - ~10.5k(3.74%)  
Credit Card Debt - ~9k(16-24%)    

Monthly Non-CC Expenditures - ~1k(Until Feb - ~2.5k)    

I recently got a new job that is allowing me to repay credit card debt at a good rate, allowing me to rapidly improve my credit score(It's never been -bad-, I've never had an derogatory marks).  Due to this I am sitting at a credit score of ~660-680(According to FICO trackers from Discover, Capital One, etc.) which is leaving me with the question of how to proceed forward from here.  Here are my considered options and pros/cons;    

Option 1 - Using a service such as Lending Club to take a loan to repay the Credit Card debt.  
Pros - CC debt will be eliminated(I'm confident in my ability to not run them back up, and I would consider that a non-issue), One single payment  
Cons - Origination Fee(2%), Potential credit impact(?)  
Approximate Rate - 2yr 9.99% APR    

Option 2 - Using my credit union/a different actual bank to take a loan to repay the Credit Card debt.  
Pros - CC debt will be eliminated, One single payment, potentionally lower interest rate  
Cons - My Credit Union is out of state(I just moved and have yet to switch banks), Closing costs(?)  
Approximate Rate - 2yr 9.00% APR(My credit union, open to suggestions)    

Option 3 - Finding a balance transfer offer to refinance Credit Card debt.  
Pros - One single payment, 0% APR for 12-18 months depending on CC  
Cons - Potentional 3% balance transfer fee, opening another credit card(I have quite a few as is), potential for a limit much too low to transfer(current highest limit is $4200)  
Approximate Rate - 12-18mo 0% APR, Variable after    

I'm open to any additonal suggestions, or any feel good/horror stories about any of these scenarios and pitfalls to avoid.  I'm looking to get this done as soon as possible to start paying this down before I have to start making monthly rent payments(I'm currently in an apartment with the next 2 months free), so I am looking to take the most aggressive approach possible in order to pay down at least half of this debt before February.  I'm confident I can make this happen, but looking for community feedback on what precautions to take, and some best practices on getting the best rates and having the most success in eliminating this debt in the most cost/time-effective way possible.

personalfinance,"First job out of college, ESPP Open Enrollment","Hi /r/personalfinance,

First, a little background information:

I started working my first job out of college a few months ago, and have been trying to keep up with all of the benefits and investment options I now have. For background, I have a ~5 month emergency fund (growing this to 6 months), and am contributing to my company's 401k up to the match (6% + 6% company match). I will also be maxing out my HSA starting next year since I will be responsible for my own health insurance. 

My salary is $66k, and my take home is $3400/month right now. Since I am going to be paying for my own health insurance and contributing to my HSA, starting in January my monthly take home will go down to about $3250. 

I have $12k in federal student loans, but their interest rate is &lt;5%, so I'm not in a rush to pay those back. I'm happy with my current spending level and have about $1200 currently left over at the end of each month which is currently going to my emergency fund. Once I have 6 months' worth of expenses in my emergency fund, I am planning on shifting my surplus into a Roth IRA and then increasing my 401k contributions once that is maxed out.

Now on to my question. I got an email today that open enrollment has begun for the employee stock purchasing plan. I'm trying to determine how much (if any) to contribute to this plan. The terms of the plan are as follows:

* Contribute between 1% and 10% of net pay over 6 months (Current open enrollment is for 1/1/2016-6/30/2016)
* On the last day of this 6 month period, the contributions will be used to purchase company stock. The purchase price is a 15% discount off of either the price on 1/1/2016 or 6/30/2016, whichever is lower. 
* After the offering period ends (6/30/2016), I need to hold the purchased stock for a minimum of 3 months before selling, or 18 months before transferring to another brokerage account.

The company I work for is a big, stable company, but I am still wary about investing a lot in the company I work for. However, the way the plan purchases stock at the lower price of the beginning or end of the 6 month offering period with a 15% discount makes it seem attractive. Is this something worth putting 10% of my net pay into? I would sell the stock immediately after the 3 month holding period.

I have about 45K in stock/cash (non-401K etc.) that I can semi-freely spend.

Because of the low interest rates, I don't mind paying off the car loan/student loans.  The monthly payment (Total) is about 1000 total though, which is a nice chunk from my paycheck though, is a burden.

I was wondering if it's good or bad to just pay everything off outright (Already checked contract, I can do this without penalty).

I am only burdened by the debts because of the 1000 monthly expense.  I wonder if reducing the payments (~800) for the car to be ~100 a month is okay and not detrimental.

personalfinance,Practical questions about budgeting and advice on taking out student loan (EU),"Hello

I'm a first-year undergraduate student studying in the Netherlands. I am originally from Finland and receive most of my income as student aid and loans from the Finnish government. I have some questions about budgeting in practice and then some questions about long-term financial decisions.

**Rough outline of current income and expenses**

*Income*

Student aid from Finnish government: 560 € / month

Allowance from my father's employer: 390 € / month

*Expenses*

Rent (on-campus housing): 650 € / month

Dining hall credit (mandatory): 150 € / month

Tuition fee: 3750 € / year or 375 € / month.

Spending: 500 € / month so far, goal is 300 € / month [note: the 500€ came as a total surprise to me, it's way way more than I expected / wanted]

Total *currently*: 950 €  / month in, 1675 € out = 725 € debt / month. Goal for total spending: 950 € in, 1475 € out = 525 € debt / month.

For my student loan, I can withdraw a maximum of 700 € / month or 7000 € / year at a 1.5% interest rate.

**Questions:**

1. How should I keep a tab on my expenses?
Looking at the wiki, I found little advice on how to keep track of expenses. My current method is taking my bank statement, opening the .csv file in excel and adding up all the withdrawals. These are mostly reported as general ATM withdrawals though; there is no itemization. What is a good way to keep track of all my expenses? I'm particularly interested in seeing how much I spend on groceries.

2. How should I budget?
I created a preliminary budget outline before I moved to the Netherlands which wasn't really a budget but more of an estimate of the general sizes of expenses I would accrue (e.g. rent, tuition, general expenses). During my first month I had to make a lot of big purchases (e.g. bicycle, some room furnishings) which also pushed me from making hard budgeting decisions. Since then it has felt that I keep running into constant stream of unpredictable expenses which are hard to budget in advance for; it's hard for me to for example plan my travel schedule within Europe. More on the practical side, what kind of software should I use - I assume excel is probably the easiest? The general problem I have is that since I haven't kept a good track of my expenses, it's hard for me to create a budget.

3. Is student loan debt a concern for me?
This section is difficult for me to elaborate on since I'm not yet certain if I'm going to complete my current bachelor's program. I currently have two main options:

* Complete my current bachelor's program and do a 1 or 2-year master's program in England. Total debt for this would be roughly 15 000 € from my bachelor's degree, and about 33 000 € for my master's (of which roughly 25 000 € as the tuition fee for the master's program), leaving a total debt of roughly **48 000 €** at an interest rate somewhere between 1 - 3 % probably.

* Switch to an English bachelor's program next year (most probably Cambridge) and complete that without doing a masters. This would land me a debt of roughly **55 000 €** with similar interest rates.

How burdening would this kind of debt be given that I intend to major in economics? Given a degree from a solid university, I would expect to make a fairly good income soon after graduating, so repaying shouldn't be very difficult if the interest rates continue to stay as low as they are. But even though it doesn't sound too bad on paper, I still feel a bit queasy about taking such a huge sum of student loan debt. Is a good education worth the money?

4. Does it make sense to cut my consumption now to reduce the amount of debt I take? In practice this would mean not going on trips in Europe or not going to a couple of music festivals in year. It comes down as total to probably less than 1000 € in a year - which I feel is not significant in the grand scheme of things IMO.
**Summary**

How can I easily keep a tab on expenses? What tools and information should I use to create a budget? How dangerous is student loan debt? Does it make sense to reduce consumption now to have a slightly smaller (~10 %) student loan debt in the future?",finance,1447709872
personalfinance,"Former employer over-reported my income, IRS has been coming after me for ""under-paying"" my taxes.","I've been dealing with this for over a year now, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned.  Before I run off and talk to a lawyer, wouldn't mind getting some other input.

I was a salaried employee in 2012 for just one employer.  Midway through the year, my company switched payroll providers which resulted in a screw up where everyone in my company had a W2 submitted for Jan - June (good), but also an additional one from Jan - Dec instead of July - Dec (bad).  Net result: everyone had their W2 income over-reported by 50%.  The correct amount was taken out of our pay checks for taxes, but because of the W2 discrepancy, everyone in the company has received notice from the IRS that they underpaid their taxes.

Last year, the IRS pinched my return because of this.  Only after a dozen letters repeatedly explaining the issue (providing documentation and contact points) has the state formally started reviewing my old return.  The IRS never seems to acknowledge any of my communications.  When I call, they insist they don't have a record of me sending them anything, and when I mail it, I never get anything back. What little additional evidence I have obtained from the state could not be more clear that the exact nature of my tax problem is from a perceived sense that I ""under-paid"" from my over-reported income.  I filed the 1040-EZ form that year and didn't have any other complications to my taxes: there's nothing else I can think of as being the source of this problem.

For context, they're claiming that I originally owed them an extra ~2k, and with penalties, the notices I have gotten from the state and feds are north of 30k.

I'll pay for a layer to deal with this if I have to, but should I just be dealing with the IRS?  Suing my former employer?  What else makes sense to look at?",finance,1447710386

I am 27 years old with a Net Pay of $55,000.  I have about $7,000 in credit card debt which I am trying to rid myself of as quickly as possible.  I am wondering if I should take out a loan against my supplemental retirement plan to pay off the credit card balance.

I have two retirement accounts.  The first has about $30,000 but it is not a viable option due to penalties and taxes.  I have another supplemental 403-b plan with $9,000 that would allow me to take out a loan for 50% of the value ($4,500 loan) at 4.25% paid back to the account over 60 months.  Seeing as how the loan interest rate is significantly lower than the CC rate, would it make sense to pay $4,500 toward the CC and then chip away at the remaining as I otherwise would?

solar,Solar finance experts: Can you please help with this scenario?,"I am wishing to have a 50KW system on my building, but don't have the tax appetite to take advantage of the federal and state credits (30% and 35%, respectively.)  I have a friend who DOES have a large enough ongoing tax liability, who is willing to try to work together on this.

I know that I can install a system for significantly less than the going rate around here of about $3/W.  I am very interested in pursuing commercial installations as an expansion of our business.

If I were to create ""InstallCo,"" what do you see the best way to structure the rest of the puzzle for maximum benefit?

For example:

•ExistingCo contracts with FriendCo for the lease and eventual purchase of a $150,000 system

•FriendCo pays InstallCo $150,000 for an installed system

•InstallCo buys, installs, and pockets the profits

•ExistingCo pays monthly payments + interest to FriendCo for 10 years (payments are approximately 2x current power bill)

•FriendCo is able to take advantage of the 65% total incentives, as well as earn interest on the ten year, $150,000 lease, in addition to the depreciation deduction

•After ten years, ExistingCo doesn't have to pay a power bill anymore

The way the money seems to work out is this:  FriendCo puts out $150,000, but gets nearly 50% of it back in the first year, and is repaid by the end of the fourth.  Their total proceeds (assuming 5% lease - I'm not sure what market rates are) over ten years add up to $273,420.

ExistingCo has essentially twice their normal power bill for ten years, but ends up owning their system, with no more power bill.

InstallCo makes a tidy immediate profit of $50,000 or more.

What do you think about this?  I'm sure it could be improved.  Unfortunately, I know nothing about how this normally works, and am calling on you for your expertise!

I feel quite helpless at the moment regarding my finances. Like I'm in a cage I'll never get out of. I came out of college with  about $20,000 in student loans. My dad took over 6,500 of it through one my loan providers, and I took over the remaining balance through the other. It has a 6.8% interest rate. When I got out of college, I joined Americorps immediately, and they awarded me with 5,500 dollars towards school expenses, which I used to payback both loans at first, and then focused on just my own. I've dumped probably about 3,500 in it, making monthly payments, but I was young and ignorant about how any of this works, interest and all that,  and I still owe about 13,000 on this loan. I feel like a complete idiot!  

After Americorps, I couldn't find steady work, and ended up working in the entertainment field, doing stuff I really love... Problem is, it's freelance, and when I'm working, I need to do my best to save as much as possible for those periods I'm not working as much. I'm, I think, great at saving, and currently have ~8,000 saved up in various places. I don't spend money frivolously. When work is great, I make between 4 and 6 grand in a month (rare), when work is bad, I'll make 200-1000 in a month. I'm paying back a credit card, making payments of 50-100 each month, remaining balance 800 - not crazy worried about this one. 

Remaining monthly payments are 625 for rent, and probably another 200-400 on utilities, insurance and food. I don't really party or go out spending money that much, so that is negligible in my opinion. 

I don't want to keep dumping money into my loans, to not see the balance go down, but I'm so scared to be caught with my pants down when work runs dry, and I need to pay rent. I also will need a new car by April, since emissions tests in Cali will yield my car inoperable.  That's another payment I'll need to make. 

I just need to figure out a way to really get my loans taken care of. I need a car, I want to enjoy the money I make, but I feel like  this burden is draining me. Ideally, I'd have my money in something that is low risk, and works for me month to month, making me a sufficient amount of money to pay back my loans, but I know any investment I make isn't necessarily safe. 

Any ideas on how I can start really paying back what I owe? Should I meet with a financial planner? I don't know what to do. 

Thank you for any advice you can give. 

tl;dr Been paying back loans all wrong, and still owe exactly what I owed after I graduated college 5 years ago. I work freelance so money isn't dependable, and saving for dry spells is necessary.

I am 27, two kids (age 4 and 2). Husband (32) finished law school in 2014, we paid off all debt a few months ago, and I just quit my job to start a consulting practice which is turning out to be much more lucrative than I anticipated. I'm only working 20-30 hours per week, but could ramp that up.  Husband is currently clerking in a federal court, and the pay is about 1/2 of what he would be paid working for a firm, but he also has really nice hours and low stress. 

We need to make some decisions in the next year or so.  If I worked my consulting practice full time, and he took a firm job, our income would roughly triple, and we could be FI in a ridiculously quick 5 years. But.....Stress!  80 hour work weeks!  Never seeing our children!  Extra expenses for more daycare and afterschool care! 

I can absolutely see the benefit of hitting hard while we have high earning potential, but I shudder when I think of what we would miss by being too time-poor to really spend time with our kids during the 5 years that we are rapidly accumulating and working crazy hours.

personalfinance,Help with Choosing a good mortgage for me?,"Hello, I am a first time homebuyer and I understand what all the different mortgages I'm looking at are. I've been considering a few different things though, and I'm just trying to get some general thoughts I guess.

I have been pre-approved for an FHA loan in which I would be receiving the down payment through the city I live in. (3-3.5%) This would be a fixed rate of around 4.125% with my current credit score. This is a very traditional way to go about it, however I of course would be paying PMI as I did not have 20% down.

Otherwise I have the option of a 5/1 ARM at 2.75% for the first 5 and IIRC the lender told me the highest I would go is 8% (Which is of course obscene) I've been looking pretty seriously at this because I have the option of refinancing in around 3-4 years.

On that same ARM if I'm understanding the lender I could do an 80/20 with 100% financing, to avoid PMI. However because of the order of leinholders that lender will NOT allow me to use the down payment assistance from the city as they are a second leinholder since they want me to stay in the city for 5 years. I would forgo the free down payment to get into something tentatively very risky. At 4 or 5 years in this situation I could once again refinance (To avoid the balloon payment and to avoid the increased interest rate) but I in most likelyhood will not have 20% paid, so  I would run back into PMI. And No one knows what the mortgage rates will be at that time.

I guess I'm just kind of trying to get a general idea of what might be the best course of action.

At the dealership when purchasing, is it possible to get them to perhaps give me a better deal on the sale price of the car if I finance through them and let them give me a bad interest rate and/or longer term finance, but then turn around and pay off this terrible loan I've just taken through them and pay it off with my cash and another loan that has a much better rate?

I am sure I am not the first person to think of this so I feel like there must be something that makes this not possible or simply not worth it.",finance,1447740920

            * - 65-72% debt to income
            * - $6000 in CC debt
            * - 120K in private student loans with 2.25%-10.45% variable interest
            * - 40K Federal Student Loans 3-7% interest
            * - $1600/month Student Loan Payments
            * - $410 rent, currently ~ $100 in utilities
            * * + 45K Base Chemist Salary, just enough to get by month to month (no emergencies)
            * + 15K OT Possibility

As a 28yr old with ~$160K in student loans, I find that I am paralyzed by the remittance terms and amount.

What options should I be considering with consolidation? And how do I find a lender that I can be confident won't hold me to the coals like I feel currently. Definitely in need of some encouragement to make some sweeping changes to my financial outlook to provide me stability and the ability to take advantage of opportunities, such as receiving Masters in Chem. Eng. that my company currently will support.  Also, would love to buy my own place ~$70-$110K, but think this is way out of my grasp.

btc,Never create incentives for centralized solutions: A parallel to the history of gold,"I posted this at the other sub a while ago; now that we have an alternative discussion forum, I feel like this warrants a repost here as well. 

_______
I'm baffled by folks who say ""it's okay that people are inconvenienced by congestion/high fees/inability to make small payments, it'll all get sorted out by sidechains/Lightning in the future; meanwhile people can move over to centralized solutions if they want to"" think nothing of what happened to gold and silver. Consider the following: 

In the beginning Satoshi created Bitcoin and the community improved on it. Payment processing was decentralized, security was ensured via PoW, nobody controlled Bitcoin. Life was good, but the economy was small.

_In the beginning people dug gold from the ground and silver was added to alleviate scarcity. You could pay anyone, security was ensured via checking and locking up an actual hunk of gold, nobody controlled where the next gold mined could pop up. Life was good._ 

Then the economy expanded, but blocksize was limited. Congestion raised fees, crashed nodes, and transaction became cumbersome; people who wanted to actually use bitcoin in their lives was frustrated. 

_Then the economy expanded and value rose, but gold and silver remained hunks of metal. They are heavy to carry, are hard to divide into small chunks, and do not travel easily over long distances. People who wanted to actually use gold for lots of commerce was frustrated._

But there is a solution! Coinbase, Changetip and Greenaddress rode to the rescue: We could just do everything offchain as long as you trust us! People flocked to the offchain shops; they are so much more convenient than the decentralized blockchain. It's not a big deal, since they're backed by the chain anyway, no?

_But there is a solution! Governments, banks and big merchant houses rode to the rescue: We could just do everything in our shiny tokens and notes, as long as you trust us! People flocked to the note issuers; they are so much more convenient than the cumbersome, nobody-in-charge metals. It's not a big deal, since they're backed by gold anyway, no?_

The use of offchain shops proliferated. Coinbase gobbled up Changetip, then in turn was bought out by Goldman Sachs. The use of Coinbase became the de facto standard of Bitcoin commerce; some holdouts still do things on-chain, but nobody cares about them, they are so few in number, and it's not like they can sell their coins to anyone but Coinbase at a reasonable price, anyway. Visa contemplates a merger with Coinbase.

_The use of notes proliferated. Banks consolidated and in turn had their note-issuing capacity absorbed by the government. Notes became the de facto standard of commerce; some holdouts still trade in gold, but nobody cares about them, they are so few in number, and it's not like their gold won't end up in a government vault eventually, anyway. Other countries contemplate adhering to a Dollar standard._

Then Coinbase declared, one uneventful morning, they they will no longer buy or sell on-chain coins. Nothing much happened because they pretty much was the definition of Bitcoin anyway, it's of no practical concern to most people.

_Then the federal government declared, one uneventful morning, that they will no longer honor gold exchanges. Nothing much happened because notes are already used in pretty much everything and nobody accepts gold anyway. It's of no practical concern to most people._

Coinbase (now part of the Visa network) betrays the people and starts colluding with bankers, inserting inflation, redistributing coins. A small group of people realized how horrible it is, and how technology can fix it. ""Maybe this time we'll do it right! Let's call it...""

_The Fed (now part of the global cartel of bankers) betrayed the people and starts giving incentives to whoever cared to lobby, inserting inflation, controlling every avenue of payment in the name of taxation.

personalfinance,Employee Stock Purchase Plan,"The company I work for just bought a round of stock for ESPP. After purchase, i'm netting about 7k gains. From what I can tell capital gains in my state + federal is going to be 31% on my gain if I just turn around and sell it now. I have a few options I am considering:
1) Keep stock for a long time not selling it
2) Sell a portion of stock to pay off my 6% school loans and keep a portion of the stock still there.
3) Sell all stock, pay off school loans and put rest of money into IRA (have not opened one up yet).

I am leaning towards 2 or 3, but the short term capital gain tax of 31% on my gain seems really high. My school loan is around 6k at 6%. I'd have to take out at least that much, but will need to keep some extra for taxes at the end of the year. If I wait for longer, I know the capital gains goes down, though I'm unsure as to how much. I feel that the stock won't increase much more then where it is at now.

I'm 26, I make around $60k/yr and take home about ~$2,800/mo after taxes.  I pay ~$500/mo for rent/utilities.   And then I have other expenses obviously: phone bill, car stuff, cat stuff, feeding my fat self, etc.

I made the poor decision of going to grad school and taking out too many loans, and now it seems super overbearing that I'll be stuck with them for 10 years!  Currently, I pay $900/mo towards my loans, and they're at 5.9% interest.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on whether to pursue a goodwill letter or pay for deletion of a negative report on a defunct account.,"So my subsidized/unsubsidized federal student loans were handed to a company called Nelnet. I can't make too many excuses but when they started attempting to collect, they notified me at an address I no longer lived at (parents, not a good relationship). Eventually they found where I actually was living 5 months later (so my credit report shows 5 months of not paying). I immediately consolidated the loans and have been paying on-time since through Navient. The accounts with Nelnet were closed January of this year. 

So my question - do I have much of a leg to stand on for a letter of goodwill? Or should I just go the route of paying for deletion? The amount past due accrued in that 5 months (April 2014 - August 2014) was just over $2,000 for reference. 

EDIT: Timeline for Clarity

* May 2013 - Graduate College

* January 2014 - Start paying private loans, parents say they will pay Fed loans

* April 2014 - Nelnet (dept of Ed) issues letters to old home to collect, I don't recieve until 5 months later

* August 2014 - Obtain letters from Nelnet/Dept of Ed loans collection - immediately consolidate loans - start paying through Navient (ontime and overpad every month since)

* January 2015 - Nelnet closes accounts

* November 2015 - Run credit report/score - learn my mediocre score mostly due to these 5 months of missed payments on a now defunct account

Also - regarding the minor mentions of issues with my parents: I definitely don't have any excuses. My mother called me in April 2014 to tell me about the first letter from Nelnet. I ignored it like a dumbass, thinking it was a solicitation. She sent me the letters in August.

personalfinance,Can I refinance 2 separate student loans with different companies? Should I?,"I'm looking into refinancing my student loans (to the tune of $96,000) and I'm having trouble getting approved without a cosigner (this is not possible).

I pay about $800/month now, but at the end of the loan term (10 years) I'll be paying nearly $2000/month which really scares me. I also will have paid about $57k in interest by the end of the term.

Since I have two separate federal loans, can I refinance them separately? I can't get approved for the full amount, but I think I can get approved for both if I apply for each loan individually.

personalfinance,"Being unfairly referred to a debt collector, how badly will my credit rating drop?","Hello, 

A few months ago I took up a membership at the UFC gym in Boston. I was a member for a few months and decided to cancel my membership. As I don't live in Boston, I tried to call multiple times over 2 months (6-7 times) to cancel my membership but each time I was told by the person on the phone that it wasn't possible to cancel my membership because the ""person who can cancel memberships isn't in the gym at the moment.""

I eventually got fed up of this and recently called my credit card company and disputed the last three months of charges because I haven't been able to cancel it through the gym. I haven't used or been near the gym in the last three months and I only resorted to this because it was impossible to cancel my membership through the gym itself. The last time I called I finally was able to speak to the GM and he sent me a cancellation form. Upon sending him the form he referred my account to a collections company (The company is called SwiftFunds and a quick google search reveals that they use scare tactics and coerce people into paying.)

I got a call from the collections company yesterday and they said my dues amount to $850+. I have NO idea how this amount is so absurdly high. I have paid my bill monthly since I got my membership except for the last three months which I disputed. In addition, when I signed up for the gym I was clearly told that my membership was MONTH-TO-MONTH and I could cancel a month in advance at ANYTIME. How can I be forced to pay such a ridiculous amount of money when i DO NOT owe that much.

I was told that my credit rating will be affected if I do not pay. In addition, the manager sent me this email 

""
I just wanted to let you know that your account was sent to collections today. If you fail to come to terms with them it does get reported by the major credit agencies...""
""

How can I get this debt removed and solve this issue. I don't want to pay the three months of membership out of principle because the gym is engaging in shady business practices and make it impossible to cancel your membership. But if that is the only way to get this imaginary $850 debt removed from my name I guess I have no choice.

However the next month, the bill comes and it says my current payment due is $341.84. -- am I prepaying interest or is my extra payment being put toward principal? 

I'm not sure how to calculate whether it would benefit me more to pay the minimum and then save any extra money I want to put on the car into a second savings account for an early payoff (so that I can accrue a small amount of interest on what's in my savings) or continue to overpay my loan.

I'm not looking for one of the million different preachy financial  ""advice"" books (think Dave Ramsey, Suze Orman, or anything titled something like ""how to cut up those credit cards forever"").  What I would like to find is more of a ""reference"" style book, that gives many of the rules of money, taxes, loans, real estate, etc.  An ""encyclopedia"" of personal finance that is not too overcomplicated for a common person to understand.  This would prevent countless hours of research on my part.  Examples of an ideal book:

-  A book that would give very complete yet understandable descriptions of how all the various types of investments work, along with their tax rules, risks, interest rates, etc.

-  A book that lists common tax laws/deductions that are often leveraged by successful individuals, that others might miss out on through poor planning.

-  A book that discusses retirement rollovers, penalties, vesting schedules, and marriage/estate laws.

-  Bonus points if the book has information concerning many of the new (United States) health care regulations, HSA/FSA rules, etc.

I have seen a series books by the Wall Street Journal that might work well, although some of them might be a few years old now.  Not sure if these would be useful or not, especially with taxes and retirement rules.

personalfinance,I used the snowball method for paying down different debt. Now I have 2 paid off accounts all with lower interest rates than my worst and last credit card. Should I do a couple balance transfers to spread the debt around lower interest rates?,"&gt; The snowball method, popularized by Dave Ramsey, debts are paid down in order of balance size, starting with the smallest. Paying off small debts first may give you a psychological boost and improve one's cash flow situation, as paid off debts free up minimum payments. The downside is that larger loans (that may be at higher interest rates) are left untouched for longer, costing more in the long run.


Now I have an open credit card with a 13.49% interest rate and a $3,500 limit and line of credit with a 13.49% interest rate and a $4,400 credit limit.

My worst and last credit card has $13,000 in debt with a 21% interest rate.

I could transfer $3K into one card at 13.49% and another $4K into my line of credit again at 13.49%, taking out $7K of my $13K debt that's sitting at 21% interest. 

But do I want to go back to having 3 different running debts with 3 interest rates, just so that my worst credit card would be at $6K with 21% interest?

With the old card and line of credit in use, and using an online payment calculator I think I would be looking at least $380 in minimum payments from those two accounts alone. 

Right now the minimum payment on my $13K debt is around $450 a month. If I did the balance transfers and took $7K out I think I would be paying a minimum payment around $200 a month on the $6K left in the card with the 21% interest rate.


So I think I would be paying more in minimum payments? Right now I'm paying $450 a month on just the one credit card at 21% interest. If I spread the debt around I think I would be paying around $580 in minimum payments. So a part of me doesn't want to do that. But I thought I would ask you all if it's smarter to spread the debt around accounts with lower interest rates?

I'm back to making my monthly payments, but I just want to be sure I'm not doing something blindingly stupid.  Should I just continue to repay the $915 a month until I graduate, get a better job, and can fully attack the Navient loan, and snowball that amount into the FedLoan, and finally attack the NJ Class (This is the one I'm afraid of most).


I originally thought I was on a 10 year track for all 3 providers, but it turns out I'm on a 20 year track with NJ class, and that scares the shit out of me, plus the accrued interest.

personalfinance,LONG POST! Needing a little help. Am I going about this the right way?,"**WARNING: LONG POST!**

A little background:

I just graduated with my bachelors in may with about 32k in student loan debt and about 6k in credit card debt. I decided to go back and get my masters and was skeptical about the finances. I turned 24 that summer so I no longer needed my parent's info on my FASFA. After filling out the form I was granted 20k in a federal student loan. My gut reaction was to only take what I need and not go into any more debt. But I decided to take the full amount and I will explain why later. I applied for a GA position and was accepted and it pays for my tuition and a stipend of about $1000/month. At that time I was also interning at a company making $13/hour working about 18 hours a week. 

**Here is the breakdown to the financial situation before grad school:**

* Federal Loans: $25k @ roughly 4.5% Paid $50/month
* Private Student Loan: $7,500 @ 10.99% (pay immediately but in school payment is $25) Paid $100/month
* Credit Card 1: $6k @ 15.99% Paid $200/month
* Credit Card 2: $800 @ 17.99% Paid $75/month
* Joint Expenses (rent, electric, groceries, home expenses, pets): $800/month
* Personal Expenses: Average about $200-250/month

After looking this over I decided to accept the full amount of the 20k loan. Split between 2 semesters this gave me 10k back (Note: I was accepted into the GA position late into the fall semester so my financial need went down. The spring semester I will actually get $8500 since the GA position covered the tuition). I was also awarded $1100 in scholarships each semester so that mainly took care of my fees. My schooling is paid for. With that loan I was able to pay off Credit Card 2 completely, Credit card 1 I got down to about 500 and slowly paid it down after that, put away $1k in savings, and paid about 650 plus a couple months of double payments towards the private loan which is currently down to $6,650.

I think so far I have made the right decision. My SO and I have been rockin along this last month and then we decided to move to a house this coming January. I am also about to start a new internship making $15/hour in a couple weeks. So my biggest concern is if this shift in finances will either put me back in the red or I will scrape by. Or maybe I'm worrying over nothing. 

**Here is the breakdown to the financial situation today:**

* Federal Loans: $35k roughly 4.5% Currently paying $50/month (This loan amount will go up in Jan when I get the rest of my loan)
* Private Student Loan: $6,600 @ 10.99% (pay immediately but in school payment is $25) Paying $100/month
* Credit Card 1: $160 @ 15.99% Paying $50/month
* Credit Card 2: $0 Paying whatever the balance is (I only use this card for monthly subscriptions which totals about $15/month)
* Joint Expenses (rent, house bills, groceries, home expenses, pets): $1200/month with the new house
* Personal Expenses: Average about $200-250/month
* Moving Expenses: About $1200 including the house deposit which half has already been paid.

**MY QUESTION**
My plan right now is to basically use all the money I have in my checking and my savings for the move. I will use the loan I will get next semester to wipe out the private loan. I want to pay down my federal loans as much as I can before my grace period ends. My question is: Will I be able to sustain my current bills based off of my income alone? Does anyone have any advice? 

TLDR: By taking on federal loan debt it has gotten me out of credit card debt and possibly private loan debt. Grad school is almost completely paid for from my scholarships and my GA position. Do I make enough to keep myself out of debt and still be able to pay down my federal loans?

My point is, is there anyways to apply for some type of forgiveness or something because I am very worried that this will take a down-turn on my credit report - as it is already from my credit cards. (They are somewhat stable and don't hurt me as much but when the time comes, I don't want the student loan to add to my personal credit card debt).

The loan is from FedLoan for Direct Subsidized Stafford and Direct Unsubsidized Stafford. UNSubsidized for 4,000 dollars and Subsidized for 2,000 dollars.

personalfinance,"@ 36, Getting my financial life in order, want to buy a house. Need input.","For the last 2-3 years I've been wanting to purchase a house.  It has been a long standing personal goal of mine.  I also like the idea of having something that truly is my own.  All of that being said - I've made immature decisions in the past regarding my personal finances.  That being said, I've always had plenty of money to do what I wanted with (not rich, not poor) but I was living paycheck to paycheck.

A little background on my situation

36yrs old.
Me and a SO have a dog.  No plans to marry or have kids.
I had heart surgery 5 years ago.  (This contributed to me not making intelligent financial decisions as I freely admit I went head first into 'mid life crisis mode').

Current financial situation
I use YNAB, My income for December is fully funded in November (so sorta 1 month ahead).  
401k is NOT maxed out yearly - it gets on average 6k from me, with 6k from employer match.
I have 1k for an emergency fund.
Total credit card debt of ~8k
At present I have around 4k in the bank.
Do to my savings goals, and with the help of YNAB - By May 2016 I should have around 30k (conservative goal) - (More realistic would be 26k).
Houses I'm looking at are in the 280-380 range, and I will most likey end up somewhere around 330k.
Credit Score is around 720-730ish
3 months of livable expenses (mine money put aside for savings) is roughly 15k.  (6m = 30k)
Currently own 2 cars, one is a Jeep TJ that has been paid off for years, the other is a 2012 Infiniti that will be paid off late 2017 (Interest rate is 1.9%) and I use that car for work travel.  My Jeep is my 'fun' ride, and backup vehicle.

Here is my pain point.
1)  A very large part of me wants 6 months of living expenses.  I like the idea of a safety blanket.

2)  I want this house.  I don't feel that a 330k house will make me house poor.  I've ran the calculations and at present my rent is $1600, and a 330k house, with 5% down would have a payment of around $2k.  My ability to save would decrease by $400 a month (not counting any additional expenses that pop up).

 I've ran numbers on the money needed to put down for closing/down payment, and it has me coming to roughly 20k.  That leaves me with 4k after.  Assuming the payment for this house is $2k, I'd be able to save roughly 2.5-2.8k a month.  This makes me feel like I'd be able to get back to the 15/30k targets fairly quickly, but I do have some doubt.

Any input is appreciated and all questions are welcomed.",finance,1447788462

personalfinance,Anyone have experience lowering rates on student loans loans?,"Hey guys,

I got into grad school recently on a full scholarship for my MBA. I made the idiotic mistake of telling my boss, because I felt he should know that I would be gone in June. Well long story short, I do not work there anymore.

I was planning on deferring my loans for graduate school; I currently have about 23K. My program provides a paid residency after the first year, so ideally I will actually be able to pay these loans off before I get out of my masters program. My wife's job is enough for both of us atm, and I'll also try to get a grad assistant job for about 150/week in grad school. I'm also applying back for jobs in Jan, as I've taken some time to work on a comic book that I've been wanting to do for a really long time.

Anyway, I came across something for Wells Fargo, saying that they could lower my interest rates for paying off loans. Does anyone have any experience for this, or any suggestions for getting my loans paid off the smart way?",finance,1447789129
investing,"Tesla's Model 3 will not start at $35,000. There's no way.","I believe it will cost around $49,000 before tax incentives. The base MSRP for the Model S was originally claimed to start at $49,900 for a 40KwH battery pack. The price was later raised and the current base price for a Model S is $70,000 before incentives and savings. That's a 40% increase. If you were to apply that same increase based on percentage, the Model 3 would not start at $35,000 as Tesla leads the media to believe, but much closer to $49,000. 

Here are some of the big challenges they're facing:

***

 - Delays - At least 2 years 

They promised to have them on the roads by [2015](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1077655_tesla-says-all-electric-3-series-competitor-due-by-2015), but there still has not been a rendering or any concrete news from Tesla. Elon tweeted that they'd begin taking orders in March of 2016 with deliveries being made in 2 years [Source](http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a12983/35000-tesla-model-iii-coming-in-2017/).

The last thing we want to see at this point is what Elon Musk said for the Model X being that they went overboard with engineering. That will just raise the price. 

***

 - Steel would need to be used to reduce costs, but that would lower range and performance due to weight.

If they used aluminum, that in combination with the costs of batteries, and the fact that Tesla will need to produce this as a base-model luxury car to compete with the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class, could bring prices close to my $49,000 number. Ford's new F150 pickup with aluminum build is about as mass-market as they come, and those trucks' MSRP bases at $25,071 for XL work truck specification, and $29,416 for shiny work truck specification. ([Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/0gwYYxD.png) | [Website](http://shop.ford.com/build/f150/?gnav=header-trucks#/select/)) Those are just no-option pickup trucks and the chromed one accounts for 84% of the supposed $35,000 starting price for the Model 3. I don't see how they plan to build an electric entry-level luxury car with that price. 

***

 - Battery costs - Around $15K

It's been said that the battery in a Model S costs around $30,000 ([Source](http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-world-vexed-by-slow-progress-on-batteries-1412552377)). Let's say, to give the Model 3 a head start, that the $30K number is for the 85KwH battery. Let's say that the Model 3 will have a 60KwH battery. That's a 29.41% reduction. If we apply that reduction in percentage to the cost, that gives us a $21,176 battery. After the Gigafactory is complete, that will supposedly make a 30% dent in battery costs.

This leaves us with a rough estimate of $14,823 for a 60KwH battery in the Model 3.

***

 - Manufacturing costs

I dug around to see how much assembly costs add to the price of a car. It's way trickier than you might think to find anything from a reputable source. Tesla has a relationship with Toyota, so I'll use this:

&gt; “60 percent of the cost of the car is the investment into the plant. 20 percent is the parts that go in the car,” says Toyota’s photogenic Executive Vice President Atsushi Niimi.  

([Source](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/02/toyota’s-secret-weapon-low-cost-car-factories/), scroll to 7th paragraph)

The plant in which the Model 3 will be built is yet to be announced, but the Gigafactory will need to be paid for so we'll use that as a semi-substitute (as both costs would be needed to reach a more accurate number, but it will suffice). A good car to compare this to is the [Jaguar XE](http://www.autonews.com/article/20140908/OEM04/140909884/aluminum-jaguar-xe-marks-return-to-compact-luxury-segment) which features aluminum construction and is in the same class the Model 3 aims to compete in.

The Jaguar XE's plant will be the new Jaguar Land Rover Solihull plant which is part of a $2.5 billion investment. Jaguar and Land Rover will both share the plant and it will be part of producing [five different models](http://www.autonews.com/assets/pdf/ane-congress/Solihull-Site-information.pdf) split between Jaguar and Land Rover's line-ups. Tesla will only have three models to pay off its expensive Gigafactory where Jaguar will have five to pay off its cheaper factory.


***

 - Possible cancellation of tax incentives. 

This will literally boost the price by $7,500 across the board in the U.S, and in states like Maryland it could boost the price from between $3,000 and $10,500 depending on which incentives are cancelled (state/federal/both). This would be a very big hit to potential clients and could in itself bring the number close to my $49,000 base price. 

***

 - Buy-in supercharger access

This isn't necessarily for Tesla as a channel of income, it's more to clear congestion for current Model S and future Model X owners. There are already complaints from owners of full stations in densely populated areas which is where most Tesla owners live. A wave of mass-market Model 3 owners would not help the situation.

A buy-in option for Model 3 owners could be handled any number of ways. A one time payment which used to be an option charged for the Model S 60/60D. It's hard to place an exact number, a price like $2,000 which is close to the one charged for the Model S might scare away potential Model 3 clients, so it's hard to pinpoint an exact number. Possibly a monthly subscription for access of $50 or so. After 5 years of paying the subscription, Tesla would make (more than) the money it charged the S60(D) owners and it could be used to fund the expansion of the networks. 

Everybody wins:   
The people who spent the most money on the Model S and X would have limited congestion, Model 3 owners would still have the opportunity to use the network, and Tesla could use the money to maintain and/or expand the network to further clear the congestion and open new routes for more potential Model 3 buyers.

financialindependence,Critique my FI/RE strategy!,"Hi all! I've been browsing the sub for a couple of days and had a few questions regarding my path to FI/RE. Here is where things stand at the moment:

- Student Loan payment: $1250 (currently $75k remaining, interest ~8%)
- Car payment: $300 (currently $12k remaining, interest ~3%)

Income: I currently take home about $4500 per month. There is usually an end of the year bonus with a take home of ~$25k. My employer does a 3% 401k match so I have been contributing that amount pre-tax.

My plan is the following. Please critique:

1) Use the 2015 end of year bonus to bring student loan balance to about $50k.

2) Continue making minimum payments on car loan due to the low interest rate.

3) Save $2k per month throughout 2016 and use that amount ($24k) in conjunction with the 2016 end of year bonus ($25k) to wipe out the student loans by the end of next year. I started with about $130k in student loans :(

4) Within the next two years, I expect to increase gross income to about $150k. So assuming a 60% tax rate, take home including the end of year bonus per month would be $7500.

5) I'm going to try to target a 80% savings rate starting at the beginning of 2017 (after the student loans are knocked out). 

My main questions are the following:

a) Should I be throwing all extra money at the student loans since it is a ""guaranteed"" 8% return?
 Does it make sense to start investing money into other investment vehicles other than the 401k before the loans are paid down?

b) Is there a calculator that can be used to predict the time until retirement? I've seen MMM's table that states a 80% savings rate is equal to 5.5 working years until retirement. I'm currently 25 and would like to become FI as soon as possible.

c) How does a mortgage/rent figure into the FI/RE computations? I'm currently living with family and would not mind staying if that significantly speeds up the time to house ownership. Does it make sense to pay for a house upfront or factor the mortgage payments in the monthly spending estimate (due to relatively low interest rates)?

btc,"Forkers and Shorters - or ""May your Codlers be Hodlers""","Anyone who tries to **fork and short** Bitcoin by attempting to suppress the ongoing normal and natural infrastructure-driven and market-driven increases in bitcoin's Value and Volume - these **forkers and shorters** will soon find themselves on the wrong side of history, abandoned and discredited and eventually forgotten.

**Hodlers (and Codlers who are Hodlers)** will simply continue to realize their unique economic imperative: maximizing Value and Volume and minimizing Fees by releasing and running the best Software on the Network.

Note: Codlers who are **not** Hodlers might not be so inspired to write code that maximizes Hodler Value.

(I'm looking at Adam Back, who evidently missed the boat on cheap coins way back when - but that shouldn't surprise anyone now, now that we've seen that although he's brilliant in Cryptography, he doesn't have much understanding of Networks and Economics.)

If it manages to hang on as the world's leading cryptocurrency (which is no longer guaranteed, due to the social-disruption tactics of the small-block trolls and censors), Bitcoin will satisfy and **by definition must satisfy** the ""constitutional"" (non-negotiable) characteritics and guarantees and expectations which we were all sold on at the beginning:

(1) 21 million coin cap 

(2) increasing Value

(3) low Fees to Users and increasing Fees to Miners through increasing Volume 

These all go hand-in-hand, and have characterized Bitcoin through its entire history and constitute the essence it has always promised to the world

All these essential guarantees are all under attack by the small-block trolls and censors 

You can bet that once Blockstream becomes the Central Bank of Bitcoin, they'll slide into the temptation to do Fractional Reserve or Quantitative Easing, and then they'll be just another Fed / Goldman Sachs / JPMorgan naked-shorting our digital gold at their pleasure (the same way they're already nonchalantly and blithely proposing to overcomplicate the simple and successful Bitcoin protocol), and at that point they could easily become Liquidity Providers, subtly undermining the spirit, if not the letter, of the 21 million coin cap.

Mark my words, in the end Adam Back and Blockstream could end up being more dangerous to the 21 million coin cap that Blythe Masters and the 1.2 quadrillion USDollars in toxic derivatives (Credit Default Swaps) which she unleashed upon the world.

We already know the following:

(a) Blockstream's Lightning Network would demand MORE fees from Users - now they're saying $20 to do a ""full write to the Blockchain"" (as if there was ever any other kind of write?!?) and;

(b) Blockstream's Lightning Network wants to steal fees from Miners, by totally distorting the network topology and forcing all transactions to go through their centralized, fragile, overpriced, complicated, unproven, easy-to-shut-down ""Blockstream Lightning Network hubs"" 

This indirectly attacks (2) - as high fees will suppress usage and crash the value - and will inevitably simply divert transactions into any altcoin which offers lower fees.

And finally, if Lightning Network were somehow to succeed in taking over a large chunk Bitcoin transactions, it would be easy for them to slip in their own level-2 sidechain-tokens - which could actually attack the bedrock constitutional principle of Bitcoin: (1), the 21 million coin cap.

Bitcoin doesn't need another layer or another protocol, and it doesn't need central bankers doing overpriced ""settlement"" on their own private, permissioned network, and it doesn't need Blockstream naked-short-selling Bitcoin IOUs via its Lightning Network altcoin tokens the way JPMorgan naked-short-sells Gold and Silver via its GLD and SLV phoney paper-precious-metals ETFs.

Bitcoin doesn't need to throw out its bedrock founding constitutional principles of increasing Value and low Fees and increasing Volume via a Fork perpetrated by Shorters (Codlers who aren't Hodlers) who don't believe in Bitcoin's natural economic and technological ability to grow in accordance with the actual existing Infrastructure and Market.",cryptocurrency,1447793962

1. Loan amount $450,000 your principal and interest payment would be $2,280 the rate would be 4.5% but you would not have mortgage insurance. Your property tax would be approximately $520 monthly and your insurance would be approximately $60. Your total payment would be approximately $2,860 but with no mortgage insurance.
 
2. If you didn’t mind the mortgage insurance your rate would be 4.125% payment would be approximately $2,181 with property tax and insurance the same. However, the mortgage insurance would ad approximately $250.00 your payment would be $3,011. Once your property appreciates you can have your home appraised and the mortgage insurance would come off -$250. You may never have to worry about refinancing unless interest rates drop.  
 
3. If you wanted the least amount of money out of pocket FHA can be done with 3.5% down payment ($17,500)
The rate would be 4.125%, payment would be $2,338 with taxes and insurance the same but you would have a mortgage insurance premium $341.77 monthly. Your payment would be approximately $3,259 total.

personalfinance,It seems this financial firm didn't hold back taxes when I made an early annuity withdrawal. Am I reading this right?,"I made an early withdrawal of $25,000 from my annuity earlier this year, so that I could eliminate credit card debt that I had accrued during a divorce. (I know it's usually not a good idea to tap into retirement, and I read a lot about it and asked many people, and decided that this is what I needed to do.) My financial planner, a commission-based agent with a big firm, and I talked about the 10% early withdrawal penalty, and also how I would be taxed on this income next year. So she talked about actually taking out more--like an extra 20% or so--to cover the taxes. I assumed that that was something that the firm would withhold on their end, and pay it directly to the IRS. (It wouldn't make sense for me to receive that money, because that would just be more income.) This is what she said: 
""To be on the safe side, I had that the net amount you are to receive, will be $25K, after state and federal taxes are withheld. No need to really do anything. Since we are withholding them for you, you will get issued a form from [the financial firm], which you will need when you file your taxes for 2015.""

When I got the paperwork, I signed it and the deal went through. But it occurred to me afterwards that I only saw a 10% withdrawal on the form--nothing about the tax withdrawal. I asked the planner about this a few days later and she said:

""I may have confused you when I said that. Basically, the IRS will look at your taxes for the year, see the distribution, your income, and your expenses and determine what is owed. You will receive a tax notice from [the financial firm].""

Does this mean, as I fear, that I'm going to have to come up with the tax money out of my own pocket? Or will the tax I owe on the $25,000 distribution be drawn from the annuity account itself? 

If I actually am screwed and have to pay this out of pocket, do I have any recourse? Because it seems to me that she told me they would withhold the fed/state tax, but maybe they actually didn't? And is that even possible? I thought the IRS required that they withhold this tax.",finance,1447800564

Huge tax discrepancy on paychecks.","I am a physician who completed training in 2014 and started pulling a real salary in July of 2014 (though I am paying back thousands and thousands of dollars a month in student loans).  The original company that hired me got in over their heads and apparently over-hired and terminated me this year; I subsequently found a new job in a different state.

I just got my first paycheck from the new employer and am trying to figure out what the hell is going on with my federal tax rate.  I am married and filing jointly and have 1 young child.  Social security, medicare, and state tax rates all seem to be correct on both employers' pay stubs that I have gotten over the course of the year and are consistent with one another.  They are correct based on IRS documents I have found online in addition to state tax tables.

However... here is where I am not sure what the heck is going on.  My old employer had me on an anticipated salary of $275,000 for the year, with their fiscal year starting in January.  Over the course of nearly 10 months of pay in 2015 (prior to my losing my compensation from them after termination), their federal tax rate on my taxable income was 19.74%.  My new employer has me on an anticipated yearly salary of $310,000 per year (well, $290,000 after my mandatory 401(A) contribution).  Their fiscal year starts November 1.  They put me on a federal tax rate of 33% of my taxable income on my paycheck.

My understanding is that in my current federal tax bracket for my income, I should be taxed at $51,577.50 + 33% of the amount over 230,451.  I do not understand why my new employer would tax me at 33%; I also do not understand why my old employer might have taxed me at 19.74% (if I made exactly $275,000, I should pay an effective rate of 24.1% based on IRS tables, right...?), unless the taxable income was far, far lower than $275,000.

The only difference I can see is that I was taking 5 exemptions at my old employer (a mistake on their accountant's part, but no huge deal) and am taking a more appropriate 3 exemptions at my new employer.

If more information would be helpful I can provide it.  If this is something that maybe couldn't be answered in a simple manner here, who do you suggest I go to to get this figured out?  I don't even know how much financial advisors would charge to review this sort of thing...

This is important to me because it affects my take home pay by at least 20% per month.  Hopefully I can get some help here.",finance,1447814973

I'm a dog sitter on a Rover.com. For those of you who don't know, it's kind of an Uber for dog sitters. Folks can use Rover to find a local sitter for their dog. 

I'm very, very good at my job. I've maintained a perfect five-star rating, and never had a single compliant. My clients love me and come back again and again. After a LOT of hard work, I was one of the most popular and well-regarded sitters in my city.

I recently had an incident. A client dropped off two dogs, both underfed. He didn't speak English very well, so I wasn't able to ask my usual screening questions. 

As it turned out, these dogs were underfed, undertrained, and in poor health. One was covered in visible scars. It was visible that these dogs came from a negligent and abusive home.

One dog viciously attacked the other. The owner left me no vet information so I called animal control.

An officer came out to my residence, and determined that the dog attacked needed urgent medical attention, and would have to be taken in. The officer also determined the attacking dog needed to be seized as well. 

Before, during, and after these events, I consulted with Rover support and the owner. I followed all instructions. 

**Immediately** after this event, Rover.com cancelled my account. I believe they are retaliating against me unfairly, and as a result, I am losing significant income. 

I'm upset that a dog sitting company is standing by an animal abuser.

The majority of the money I have I spend on food, eating out, and fun stuff with friends. 

I have student loans totaling right now around $15k but they will be increasing next semester and the following year to around $25-27k. The loans are all technically separate:

* $5,500 with 3.86% interest
* $6,500 with 4.66% interest
* $3,750 (which will increase to $7,500 next semester) with 4.29% interest

I also have the ability to refinance my student loans through my work (subject to my credit) with fixed interest rates between 3.2% - 5.1% and variable between 1.1% - 3%. Could this be a good option?

Should I be making any payments on these student loans while in school?

I also have two credit cards, each with about a $2k balance. 


I just need some basic help with budgeting/not spending money all the damn time and how to save money for the future. I have already read the side bar info about budgeting. I hope to eventually have good enough credit to buy a nice, new car after finishing school (maybe even earlier?), with either financing it or buying it in cash. 

As far as when I am done with school, I will be transitioning into a new role with my company making most likely around $100k, but may have to move somewhere in California for it.

personalfinance,Need help with former employer not paying final checks.,"Hi all. Some of my friends and previous co-workers are in the same situation. It's a long story, and I will try to be as detailed as possible. I worked for a company, who let their managers basically embezzle company funds freely for almost three years (they bought a lot of food, alcohol and electronics, almost $75k just this year alone, plus his daughter and baby's daddy have been on the payroll for over two years and hardly ever showed up to work). The owner was either naive, being lied to, or bullied by the managers to let this happen, I'm pretty sure the manager has ties with Mexican cartels (this is in southern California).


 Either way, the owner's money pretty much ran out, and he decided to sell the company along with it's contracts and assets to some new buyers for $2 million, and the day before the papers were signed all employees were laid off, this was done so that the new owners didn't inherit any of the payroll liability. That left the old owner 72 business hours to pay us our remaining payroll. We all got paid a salary rate, regardless of how little or how much we worked. Which was great for his family, because they would be off months at a time, while I've had more that one 32 hour day. 


 Regardless, the layoff was at the beginning of September, and we still have not received our final pay checks for the last two weeks that we worked. After the first week that we didn't get paid a bunch of the guys went to the department of labor and filed a complaint. Before we all got laid off, a group of guys got with the new prospective owners and we decided who would be rehired to maintain the contracts and keep working with the company after the official lay off, and there was about 12 of us. The company wide lay off was on a thursday, and we were back working that friday. The new owners said they would compensate us for our time that we were unofficially working, and they did. We were paid for two and a half weeks worth of work that we did for them, but we never were official employees as far as signing any sort of employment agreement.
 

One day while we were in the office, a random lady walked in and introduced herself as a federal agent from the Department of Labor, and said that the company was being investigated for not paying the final payroll to any of it's employees. She had been in contact with the old, and new owners and was looking for the company time cards to see how much they owed. Time cards were always a bit of a joke, because we were legally hourly, but they always paid us salary, so no matter what was put on the time card, our checks were always the same. (yes, I know very illegal) We never had an official HR, but there was a guy that did payroll twice a month, who was no longer employed by the new employers. The agent had me call him and tried to get him to send her the payroll, but since he wasn't an employee any more, he wasn't much help. The new owners got wind that she was there, and came in to have a meeting with her.  The short of the meeting was, that the new owners were liable for the payroll, regardless of the agreement they had with the old owner, and they they could no longer pay us directly because of the federal investigation, they now had to pay the feds the money, and the feds would in turn, pay us the amount that they decided after the investigation was done. 


O.K. fine, still waiting for that. In the mean time the new owners caught wind of the real dept that they were in, which was close to 1.75 Million,  and they decided to just give the company back to the old owners and wash their hands of the whole thing. The only reason that we continued to do work for the new owners was because we saw an opportunity to finally make some money and not have to worry about the old manager and his family taking all the profits and using them for his own personal interests, but since the old owner was back in we were kind of wary. The embezzling manager was still out, but that still left things very shady. The original owner is out of Pennsylvania, our office was in California, and they opened a office in Florida too. The old owner decided to make one of the manager in Fla. his new CFO. 


He started off by making us schedules and having us turn in weekly time cards. After two weeks, he stopped offering us hours, but instead said he was going to 1099 everyone and make them contractors, and give them a per job rate, a few of us declined and they just stopped paying us. All in all they owed me 5 weeks of pay, two from the initial layoff in September, and then three weeks after the old owners took back over. I haven't worked for them since the middle of October, but got a check about two weeks ago for a weeks worth of pay, but not the rest. They aren't even paying they employees that they still have ""working"" for them even though they are still in business. It's a bloody mess and we just want to get paid for the work that we have done. what do you guys recommend?

personalfinance,"Worried about possibly owing back taxes, what can/will the IRS do? What should I do?","So quick back story:

I held the same university job throughout the summer and school year of both my junior and senior years of college. I had heard at the time that if I didn't make more than 10k a year, I wouldn't be required to pay either federal or state income taxes. Thus, I claimed myself as exempt on my forms so I could get more money each week and not worry about filing a tax return at the end of the year. I did this while my father claims me as a dependant, which I think is ""technically"" illegal but I figured it didn't matter (to the IRS) as I wouldn't end up having to pay taxes anyways.

My junior year I made about 8k and my senior year I made about 7k. I have since talked to a friend who did pay taxes while making a similar amount of money and now I am worried that I owe money to the government.

I am a recent graduate heading into the workforce with a good job (68k/year) and no debt. I just want to make sure that what I did my last two years of college won't hurt me down the road.

Do I owe taxes from the money I made either of those years? If I do, I am almost positive that the amount is very small. However, will these small amounts gain interest/penalties/fees over time and become large debts down the road? How do I go about finding the answers to these questions? If I do owe money, how do I pay it as early as possible? Can I retroactively get in trouble for claiming myself as exempt while my father claimed me as a dependant?

Thank you for taking the time to read this.",finance,1447832707

Options?","**EDIT: after some feedback it's looking like a high-yield savings account might be a better option. I'm completely out of my depth in this area. Discover (my cc provider) has one with a 0.95 APY, but I'm seeing that there are many with higher rates...**

I've been lurking on PF for quite a while now, and have gotten tons of great advice! For example, I just requested for my credit limit to be doubled to try and bump up my credit score (currently mid-740s), and got a $1k increase, no questions asked!

Some background:

* I've had a Discover IT card for nearly a year now, and pay it off early every single month. I use it for cash back categories and gas - that's all. 
* I also have a Chase checking &amp; savings account. The savings account is my emergency fund with $3k (enough for about 6 months, longer if I'm frugal). Checking stays around or just under $1k
* My parents are helping with tuition, but most of the money comes from a 529 plan that I put $200/mo into. Currently that has around $4.5k, and should last me through college with some more contribution on my part.
* I have $17k in federal loans, expected to be &lt;$25k by graduation
* I have a full-time job now making $2400/month
* When I go back to campus in January, I'll make about $400/month at my part-time job

Over the next two months, with my last paychecks from my job, I'll have about $4k of income (before expenses, which are ~$600/mo). **I'd like to take $1.5-2k from these paychecks and invest them in some sort of low-risk account to build up some extra cash for post-graduation expenses, but I don't know anything about my options.** Should I just put the extra money into my 529 plan?

I use Mint.com to budget. I'll be looking at purchasing an engagement ring for my SO in the next year or so. I am an avid cyclist, which is an expensive hobby. And I love cookies, because who doesn't love cookies.",finance,1447855041

I only make roughly $2k/mo and my debts out weight me credit every month so I'm having trouble paying my student loans.

**[Playlist here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPx3JX5V4w8sz8p5Sj16ToU_DbdoYtifq)**

The show starts out a bit meh, but each episode just gets better and better than the last. It obviously helps if you've played or know about the game, but since it's a rogue-like game with very little ""actual story"" to it you can watch it without having ever played. 

The show itself is based on a normal play through of the game(with The Kestrel); an old ship &amp;amp; crew loyal to the Federation are tasked with going through 8 sectors to deliver vital information about the Rebellion's flagship. What's different in the show is that the crew are fairly well-written instead of just being a generic sprite with different abilities. 

Initially there are 3 humans to make up the whole crew; 2 are salvagers and 1 is the leader of the salvage fleet itself. Together they find info on the rebel flagship and start off on a journey to get that info to the front lines. As the show goes on they're joined by, and encounter, many different characters, races, and factions. And these characters actually get some development, and when they do it's very enjoyable.

In addition to this, the series also expands on the backstory for FTL's setting. The latest episodes have introduced various leaders of the Rebellion and Federation, as well as detailing some of the events that occurred before the game and caused the war to occur.

It's also worth noting that there's a ton of original art and animation in this. [And it's fucking great.](http://pre07.deviantart.net/b6a8/th/pre/f/2015/304/f/6/halloween_by_wonderwig-d9f28nn.jpg)

Anyways, that's enough of an overview I hope. I just really enjoy the series and think it's a shame that it doesn't get too many views(a few thousand per episode), so I'm hoping to help out the show by sharing it here.

We have no savings to speak of, and no retirement (about 20 years away), but we have good insurance and credit (paid off every month) and a decent income now.  I handle the finances, and we're in a good position to start saving and be more stable than we ever expected to be.  I'm currently unemployed, also, so whatever I manage to make next year is extra savings/retirement.


We will have a year-end bonus of at least 10k, net.  This is not slated for anything other than savings.  As I understand it, Indiana offers a 20% tax credit for 529 contributions, maxing the credit at $1000 per year.  I realize it's a slight risk to say that we'll be able to pay $5000 toward our youngest's college expenses next year, but it's a pretty safe bet that we'll contribute at least that much.  

* Would it make sense for us to put half of our bonus into a 529 in order to take advantage of the full credit this year?
* If the fed raises the interest rate and we have a conservative short-term 529, how much of a hit could we take?
* Are we correct that a $5000 account will give us $1000 back in the spring, to further contribute to some sort of savings?

First of all. Thank you redditors, there is a so much great info posted on this site. Before, during and after my home purchased. I check many of the posts here already and noted the great advice giving. Thanks again for such awesome community.

* Background and current finances Info:
Currently single, no outstanding debt of any kind, graduated from a local college with a bachelors in Computer Info Technology and working on local company as a Technician with great pay.
I have a 7 year old car that was fully paid off around 3 years after it was purchased, always on time and more than the minimum payment was made in order to build my credit (so I think).
I have one major credit card with my local bank, a visa and 3 department store credit cards, no balance on any of them.
Serve in the military for 6 years, I got out 2 years ago. I saved about 5k from my last deployment and fully use the GI Bill to pay for college, I save additional money from work study jobs, extra cash from housing, limiting expenses. End up saving to 15k for home purchasing.
After paying closing costs (around 3k), buying furniture/electronics/etc. for the home. I end up with 8k which are in savings and will be used only for emergency.

* Home Loan Info:
Home valued at 85k, I got a loan of $63,750.00 at 30 years fixed interest rate from Wells Fargo using a VA Home Loan. The remaining 25% of the mortgage will be paid lump sum at 10 years using a local program that I qualify as a veteran.
Home Payment Info:
Principal $88.35
Interest $225.26
Escrow $227.03
Current payment $540.64
I set up auto payment of $600.00 and I plan to pay around the middle of the month around $200.00 extra towards the principal.
I wanted to get a low price house as a first time home buyer with a low mortgage payment so in difficult times, I can still make at least the minimum payments. However my idea is to pay it up as fast as possible.

* Questions:
I would like to create an Excel table to display the life of the mortgage and different what-if scenarios. I google a couple but it seems confusing. Can someone help me with the provided info? If more info needed, do not hesitate to ask.
What are your suggestions/comments regarding the mortgage payment? A few friends that I have disclose this info state that I pay too much in interest and not enough on principal which is why I make a second payment on the month (when I can so it doesn’t happen always) to pay it as soon as possible.
Should I refinance after 5 years into the mortgage? I have heard goods and bads for this one.
Thank you for any feedback/information you may provide. Any extra info needed for your analysis, feel free to ask. Thanks again.",finance,1447869664

Currently, the Federal Reserve is run by independent banks. The banks have an incentive to control inflation because they own so much money. Inflation means the value of their money goes down.

We could use Ethereum to build a distributed bank, where your voting share is exactly tied to the amount of tokens you own. Voters will have a natural incentive to control inflation. They'll also (hopefully) seek to build reserves of other assets (Ether, REP, etc) to shore up prices when there's a selloff.

Such assets could be held in escrow.

personalfinance,My frustrating IRA problems.,"At my job I have an IRA retirement fund that takes in 3% of my paycheck and is matched with my employer's copay, very standard. My problem is with either my employer or my IRA investment company, someone keeps dropping the ball and my payments to my IRA retirement account are not going through. If I don't pay close attention to it sometimes it can go months without getting a payment, and right now it's missing a few thousand dollars because life got busy and I stopped watching it like a hawk. My employer says they keep sending the checks but the IRA company just isn't cashing them.

My fuse for listening to excuses is running short, I want to drop this IRA because it is so frustrating having to deal with this all the time. The retirement fund is really only accruing ~5% interest rate I think, but my student loans are 6.5% interest rate and higher, why am I investing for my future when I'm being fucked by student loans now?

One route I want to go is just to have my employer add the IRA matching copay to my paycheck as well as me keeping my 3% IRA contribution. I know this means it will be taxed as part as my income, but I'm okay with it because I want to pay off my student loans now and I just don't want to deal with the IRA anymore. My employer is unsure of the tax laws about giving me the IRA co-pay directly and he says it might not be possible, is there any truth to this or is he just misleading me?

If I can't get my IRA copay added to my paycheck then I'll just keep the IRA going (as frustrating as it is). If my contribution payments keep getting dropped could I just start filling out wage theft complaints to my state? I cannot tell if my employer is being truthful that they are writing out my IRA checks, but the excuse that the IRA investment company just isn't cashing the checks is getting really old. I do have reason to believe it is my employer who is dropping the ball  because ""we just didn't send the check"" was a previous excuse.",finance,1447881328
personalfinance,Student soon to be making money as a student; what should I do with it?,"Hi guys, I'm a 21 year-old junior majoring in mechanical engineering. This is my current financial situation:

- I have ~1000 bucks to my name, 
- In approximately two years I will be graduating with ~65k college debt (private and federal loans) at an interest rate of ~8.5%. 
- I do not own a car nor a driver's license. My parents can spare around $1000 towards one. 
- I do not have a job
- I buy and cook all of my meals (i.e. no mealplan)
- I will be living in a dorm until I graduate (I go to Temple in North Philly, which has a high crime rate). 
- I currently live on around $120 a month (food, life shit). 


I'll likely be able to find an internship or co-op over the course of the next year, during which I will realistically make around $15-$20 an hour. **By the start of my 2016 Fall semester, I should be the proud owner of around ~$8400** (assuming I work for 40 hours a week for three months and without accounting for taxes).

**I need advice on how to allocate this money**. My current priorities are the following:

- Get a car under $4000, purely for going to and from work. 
- Allocate money towards an emergency fund

...and that's about it. I don't know what else I should do to proactively use the money I'll earn. 

**Car:**

The most immediate financial issue I currently face is getting a car that will do what I need and nothing else. My parents are unable to drive me to the internships I will likely receive.

The catch-22 is that I need a car to get to my internships, but I need the internship money to get a car. 

Getting a non-career-related job while being a student is a worst-case scenario. I spend +40 hours a week doing math problems and gaining experience from clubs; I currently am working six group projects, two of which I am in charge of. The remainder of my time is reserved for sleep and my sanity. 

Any advice on how to get +$1000 in the next few months would be greatly appreciated.

**Rest of the money:**

What should I do with the ~$4000 that remain? I am utterly clueless on whether I should have an emergency fund to deal with any short-term financial problems, or if I should start taking chunks out of my student debt. How would I go about doing both? What other things should I do with it?

I am also not sure if there are any ways to spend this money that would help out my career. I have purchased a tailored suit, but I don't know if there's any other big stuff that I need. 

------

I encourage constructive criticism of my plans and whatever else. Thanks for reading this far!

**tl;dr: Got $1000, will graduate with 65k debt at a high interest rate, don't have a car or an emergency fund, and will have $8400 by this time next year. I'm unsure of how to best allocate this upcoming money for my future.**",finance,1447883439

personalfinance,"Student Debt, Public Service Forgiveness, and Frustration","Hi all, 

I am sitting on a big chunk of student debt. I have in total around $170,000 at an interest rate around 8%. This stems from graduating with my MBA in 2011. 

My plan both before and after school was to enter the nonprofit space, make income-based payments, and use the 10-year loan forgiveness. I thought I did my due diligence, asking my financial adviser (private), my school's financial aid office, and Great Lakes, the lender, if I was doing things right. 

I found out yesterday that I have the wrong type of loan for forgiveness, and to be eligible, I would need to consolidate, resetting the clock. I am right now 4 years into the 10 required. 

Great Lakes was somewhat sympathetic, but unwilling or unable to help. They suggested I call Fedloans and see what they say. 

I'd love any advice -- any hope of getting those four years counted in any way, any suggestions on what to do now. It was completely deflating and a gut punch to hear that my planned exit from the debt was not going to be viable. 

Currently, I make $110,000 and work for a nonprofit, so it is indeed viable to reset the clock and continue making income-based payments, but thinking about that kind of makes me sick at my mistakes.",finance,1447886318

personalfinance,I've borked several years of my taxes BIG TIME. Scared to death.,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I was taught ZERO personal finance skills growing up, so this is a learning curve I've had to navigate by myself as a young adult. I already know I'm woefully uneducated here, and that most of the fuck-ups I'm about to describe are pathetic. I'm looking for advice rather than judgment.

I recently got a letter from the IRS informing me that I hadn't filed my income tax return for 2012. I was still relatively new to the workforce at the time (I had only filed one return before in my life), and because by TurboTax's calculations I was only owed a small amount of money that would have been consumed by TurboTax fees anyway, I didn't bother to finish filing. Apparently this was a mistake.

Since then I've started reading up more on state and federal income taxes, and I realized I had a bunch of other misconceptions about what did and did not need to be reported. For one, somebody told me that you don't need to report income under $600, so I've accepted payment for odd jobs that I never reported.

I've also learned that you have to report gifts. Since I was a teen, a relative has also sent me monthly checks (between $100 and $300 each) to help me keep my head above water. I have never reported these either, because I didn't think they counted as wages earned. Now I'm not sure and I'm scared to death that I could go to jail for tax evasion because I didn't pay something I didn't know I needed to pay.

Probably the worst part is that last year I didn't bother filing at all. I was in the midst of a severe depression and just didn't do it. I know I'm on the IRS' radar now because of that letter they sent me, and I just don't know where to begin to sort out this mess I've gotten myself into.

What's the likelihood that I can be jailed for these mistakes? Who should I talk to about getting my finances above board and making sure I don't repeat the same mistakes again in the future?",finance,1447891833

I have 10k in the bank right now. Planning on using the entire amount and forgo a 6 month E fund since I live with my folks and we have a pretty great relationship so if I fall under financial duress they would take care of me. I know most of the PF subreddit love E funds and I do too but still.

The plan is to make minimum payments and dump most of it into the 20k 6%. However, my main question is, is it worth to immediately pay off the 5 and 4.5% since they are relatively low balances? It would bring me peace of mind to have 2 loans gone but is it worth it financially? 

Also, is the standard 10 year payment plan the fastest there is? I want to get rid of these loans ASAP so I am curious if I can choose a faster payment plan, or use the standard and make additional payments to principal as needed. The provider is Great Lakes

I am a GS07-10 (55k) stationed in San Diego. My position promotes me each year from GS09, GS11, and then GS12-01 (77k) by May 2018. I then get step (01-10) promotions from GS12-02 through GS12-10 which ends at a 99k salary, about 18 years from now. Job security is very good and I plan to retire here. I will most likely be married by the end of 2016. My fiance makes 30k now and i estimate she'll be in the 60k range in 13 years. My fiance and I have plans to save money to buy a home, unfortunately we have no idea how much houses cost at this time. But if we can afford it, we will most likely start looking. We will also probably have a kid or two in our late 20's early 30's and hope to have a home around the same time.

I would like to have a set-it-and-forget-it methodology unless one of you can convince me that i would make a ton more money if i decide to manually set my allocations.

personalfinance,Legal method of ensuring lender will allow you to repay them (yes you read that right),"So I have sort of an odd question.  I'm saving for a down payment on a house (doing very well) and am on track to have a down payment plus closing costs around april.  I live well below my means, have a $0 balance on every line of credit (2 credit cards nothing else) and a credit score that varies between 776 and 833 depending on where I look (Citicards Fico score is the 833) so I'm sure I'll be approved.  I currently live in a house (renting) that I was previously planning on buying, but the house next to my sister is now for sale at a very good price for what appears to be in pretty good shape.  Glossing over the pro's and con's of living next to family (definitely considering that as well) my aunt who always wants to help wants to help me with my down payment.  I never and I mean never ask anybody for anything, and always refuse when offered.  I make decent money, have very few expenses, and live WELL within my means (if not a bit below).  Repaying her would be extremely easy and would be done by that same April/May time frame as I was previously on target for.  In addition to my full-time job which is very secure (I'm very good at what I do, have great relationships in the office all around, and they have a very sincere need for me that has no signs of going away anytime soon), I also fix computers and setup networks for individuals and small businesses on the side.  All of this to say that even losing my job would not result in me having issues repaying my mortgage and this 'family loan' that my aunt wants to offer.  If any one of these things was not true, I wouldn't consider it in any way shape or form.  I should also mention that while I would have enough money now for an FHA loan, I want to avoid it as it appears to be the ""sucker's way"" of buying a house that has negative implications that can last 30 years and so I'd really, really rather not.  So I'm holding out until I have 5%+closing costs (estimating approximately $7000).

Having said all of this, and because I do like that house much better than this one, and it is in a good area that is also very close to my work I am considering this offer with a number of conditions.  First, because she very frequently offers to help, and if she gets a chance to pay for something extra she will I am very concerned that she will try and either call it a gift entirely or try and tell me to stop paying her before she is completely repaid.  I do not want this for a number of reasons.  Unrelated but kind of paints a picture of this behavior is I recently broke down on a road trip and desperately needed a part out of my garage next-day aired.  I called home, told my mom to grab the part and shipped it out FedEx (her account as she used to own a business) and upon returning home she would not let me repay her the $220-ish charge for shipping out the part.  Again, I make good money, I live well, she shouldn't feel sorry for me, and yes, she's a very nice person, but I refuse to be a burden to people.  

All of this to ask my main question.  Is there any legal way to guarantee someone will allow you to repay them?   I mean, I could draw up an agreement (and would) stating the repayment schedule, an interest rate that was financially in her favor (higher than her current rate of return on whatever investment I can use as a best case scenario estimate) and everything but I don't think it's in any way enforceable.  I mean, you can't have a ""reverse lawsuit"" as far as I know and so I would have no recourse to force her to take her money back.  Weird problem I know, but still.  I'm only willing to consider this if it's legitimately beneficial to her to do it.  Can anyone chime in with a mechanism by which I could have some guarantee that she wouldn't try to turn it into a gift?",finance,1447899680

Brewpi is a project orginally based on a raspberry pi/arduino (recently moved to Spark), where the goal is to automate some beer brewing processes.  They have a premade version available, but it is EXPENSIVE (~$150), and has all sorts of features that I wont use, such as Mash Temperature Control, a fancy touchscreen, RS-485 connections and lacks some that I do want, such as two sets of 2x120VAC outputs to control heating/cooling for a fridge (currently the code only supports one ""chamber"", ie one fridge consisting of a pair heating/cooling outputs, but future code or my own code fork will support multiple chambers).  In order to support this, I have decided to go with 4 Triacs paired with 4 triac drivers.  


On the circuit, TD1-TD4 are the 4 triac drivers (Fairchild MOC3163M) driven by the Spark Photon microcontroller at 5V, and DTRI1-DTRI2 are the Dual BTA10-600BW Triac Packages (I created them as an entity in Altium to allow me to place the [heatsink/TO-220s](http://media.digikey.com/photos/Aavid%20Thermalloy%20Photos/578622B03200.jpg) properly). The triacs are rated for 600V 10, but they will be closer to 120V 2A.  TMP1-TMP4 are the terminal block connections to the temp sensors, C1H and C1C are the Chamber 1 Heating/Cooling Elements, with C2H and C2C being for the second chamber.  Lastly 12V1 thru 12V4 are switched 12V terminal blocks, fed switched 12V from Q1-Q4.


In order to supply the switched AC, mains voltage will be present on the PCB.  It will also be stepped down via T1 to 12VAC, which is rectified and filtered.  I have combined an LM7805 and LM7812 in the same type of heatsink used by the triacs to provide regulated 5V and 12V.  


I am not super familiar with working with traiacs, so I am asking anyone who has worked with these circuits before to do a sanity check on my design.  Basically, will it work and not destroy my PCB and attached devices?  I understand that the PCB will need to be laid out with the proper clearances in order for this to work.  


I currently have the LM7805 bridged to the microcontroller's 5V VIN.  This is also a USB device.  Is there some sort of isolation required to seperate self-power and USB bus power?  With regards to other isolation, I know I need a fuse on the incoming AC before the transformer.  Do I need to also fuse each 120VAC output?  If so, can I do this right before the terminal block on the HOT line?  


Thanks for the help, and point out any other issues you may notice.  I majored in EE, but it has been years since I last ""practiced"" as an EE, so my skills may be poor at the moment.

Nope...half of my portfolio is in index funds. The other is in stocks individually chosen but for different reasons. I would like to start using more complicated methods for stock picking rather then short-handed ones but I am still learning many things.

For AT&amp;T, I came up with an intrinsic value of $30.48 which is pretty close to this company's stock price of $33.54 at the time of this post. 

This is an image of my calculation. I used a two stage dividend discount model. For high growth rate I used 4% which is close to analyst estimates on Nasdaq.com then I just slashed that in half and used 2% for stable growth rate.

personalfinance,Is buying a mobile home for a short period (5-8 years) a good idea vs renting while I save for a down payment on a larger investment?,"I grew up in a mobile home and they provide the amount of space and privacy I'm looking for.  I'm SO tired of renting an apartment where if I'm in the bathroom I can hear my neighbors watching tv, the laundry is never available and the complex and management leaves much to be desired.

I figured that if we stayed one more year and saved enough for a down payment (10-20%) on a cheaper mobile home for the next few years, I calculated that (even with a higher interest rate mortgage + lot rent) I'd be spending just about the same in rent over the years at my cheap for the area apartment as I would paying off a mortgage on a property where I'd actually get something back after I sell it, even if not for the price paid (which I know is realistic with a mobile home). **let me be clear, I plan on selling it for a loss.  I estimate half of the value paid**  A lot of people are mentioning ""flipping it"" and that is not what we desire. 

I'm also aware of the work that these types of homes require and I'm willing to accept that.  We really just need some privacy after years of renting and roommates, we'd love our own yard for our dog who is not very fond of communal living.

Ideally, we'd be saving for a down payment for a B&amp;B out of state (100-200K) in the mean time, and also have the sale of the mobile home to fund the move and/or additional funds for the down payment.

(Edit) We are in Southeast Michigan- Detroit suburbs.  We currently pay $645/month in rent. This is the cheapest apartment that allows pets in the area that I'm comfortable being outside at night in. I have been looking into mobile homes in the 15K- 25K range, give or take.  The lot fee in the parks we're looking into range from 300-400 for lot rent.  We plan to pay off the entire mortgage within this period, the earlier the better.

My question is, what am I not thinking of in this situation?  Has anyone done this that could give advice?  Am I being naive?  

If it's any relevance, I'm 24F, my SO is 26M and we *gross* about 69K combined*.

So my overall general question is ""how screwed am I"" 

Let me explain:

So I'm currently a senior at a good private school in CT. I double major with finance and international business and minor with economics and asian studies and I just got my first full time offer of 65k annual plus a 5k signing bonus wih a 5k relocation stipend.

The offer is for Stamford, CT....

I'm beginning to think about/ plan out my expenses for the following year which includes paying back student loans... Here is the problem....

When I originally got accepted into my university I didn't think I could pay for it so It was a bit out of the question... But then my parents later told me they would help me pay for it and I would only have to pay back about 25k in student loans. I thought that was an acceptable amount and my parents really wanted me to go to the school so I thought they would help me out.... I'm not being told that I don't actually have 25k, but I have 125k in loans... Essentially they just helped me out by taking out loans in their name in the assumption that I would later take on the loans and pay them back.... To be completely honest I would never want to have taken out 125k to go to the school and would have just went to a public university instead..

The loans have an interest rate of about 7%.

I'm not here to complain or anything... I'm aware of what is going on... I'm not asking for sympathy.

Being a finance major I have my own ideas on how I should begin to payback, what my budget is going to look like for the next 10+ years, so on and so forth...

I wanted to get a second opinion on what I should begin to think about doing.... Thoughts? Please and Thank you!

personalfinance,My friend (32 yo) is a nurse practitioner (85k/year) and she has $195000 is student loans.,"She has these loans consolidated and pays 1 payment each month.  

I have encouraged her to find out if she can get out of this consolidation program and pay each loan separately using the avalanche/snowball method.

Is this possible?  Does anyone have any experience?  She makes great money but is totally burdened by this debt.  I believe if she took some per diem work she could easily pay this debt down in no time with her normal salary, and the avalanche method with some per diem RN work...

edit 1 (sorry, new):  For all her intelligence it didn't occur to her that consolidating and paying one payment would mean that the interest was most likely compounding in a bad way.

My question is:  has anyone here ever stopped a consolidation program and went back to having the separate loans to pay off avalanche style?  

edit 2 (sorry x2):  She has a single payment plan set up with FedLoan Servicing for 7 loans...  She pays 1 bill for those 7 loans.

tl;dr:  what is fedloan servicing and how can you get out of a contract with them in order to start the avalanche method for student load repayment to the tune of $195000(USD)?

So, I've been renting an in-law home (like a small house on the back of someone's property) in a residential neighborhood in Pasadena for the last year. I have a 1-year lease that will turn into a month-to-month agreement, with the same terms, at the end of this month. 

So parking has always been a bit of a weird situation, when we moved in it said in our lease and our landlords assured us that we could get permit parking for $200/year/per car to park on the street in front of the house. The city ended up denying our permits because the landlords technically have enough room for everyone to park, but to do so we have to park all 4 cars in front of one another in a single driveway, which does not work for anyone's schedule at all. Since the lease said there was available parking and then there wasn't, our landlords amended the lease to say that we could park our two cars in the driveway, and they would pay nightly to park on the street. 

Out of the blue they texted me last night saying they were unhappy with the parking situation, and want us to park on the street AND not to leave or enter their property after 10:00 at night. I'm less miffed about the parking, though it is a significant expense (about $180 a month for both cars), than the curfew request, which is something they never brought up before and is utterly unreasonable in my opinion, especially since my job often requires me to work later than that. I don't want to deal with it, and since our lease is up in about two weeks anyway, I want to just move out at the end of the month.

So my question - we're supposed to give 30 days notice of our leaving. If I give notice now and leave by November 31st, will I still have to pay full rent for December? I want to avoid that and am unsure how to go about it. Thanks.",finance,1447957675

personalfinance,"Starting a new job, help a PF newb plan his retirement/debt payments!","Hello all,

For context: I am about to be 27 (M) and am starting a job later this month. I have been considering various different methods to attack my debts, which are below:

Student Loan - $24,288.77 @ 5.75% 


Car Loan - $7,749.51 @ 3%

Here is what I'm thinking:

I consolidate my student loan to be a 5-year payment term with a variable interest rate of around 3.25% (this is around what I am getting offered). Since both of my debts are now low interest, I can afford to max out some retirement vehicles (401k, Roth IRA, maybe HSA). I got offered a 6% full match on my 401k from my employer, which is very generous and will help a lot. I will be making a 90k salary at this job as well. I don't have many expenses, so I will throw any extra money at my debt instead of investing in any after-tax accounts.

This sounds good in my head, but the only caveats I see are:

1. **The stock market is risky** - It's been good for the last half-decade or so, but if it drops I'm going to lose out big time where I could have made a guaranteed 3% ROI on my debt.

2. **The Federal Reserve may be raising interest rates soon** - This will increase the cost of my debt and may add risk if I lose my job or something.


My alternative idea is obviously to contribute to the match, pay down the rest of my debt as fast as possible, and then once all my debts are paid, to max out my retirement. However, this seems  a bit like I'd be sacrificing a lot of future money due to compound interest. 

So PF....how does this sound?",finance,1447958366

Bitcoin,Paranoid Synthesis of Recent Events,"Recent tragedies has proven that you cannot exchange your freedom for security. We are far less free than we were 15 years ago and what do we have to show for it?

Think about this, within just a couple days of the event happening several miraculous things occurred. Immediately bombs were being dropped in Syria. When these sorts of events occur our emotions override our logical processing. How is it that we couldn't catch the bad guys who were using UNENCRYPTED SMS messages to communicate, yet within days of the event we were able to concretely link this event to Syria? Immediately Russia comes in and bombs literally hundreds of targets in Syria.

Or think about this, immediately the media was interviewing experts who were claiming that encryption was what prevented the intelligence community from preventing this. But then it turns out they were communicating over unencrypted SMS. In this case it is patently obvious that they are using the cover of this tragedy to promote an anti-encryption agenda.

How is our intelligence so good as to be able to concretely determine who is responsible and how to re-act so quickly after the fact, but completely incompetent to prevent it? Basically what I'm saying is that in order to organize such a tremendous response so quickly the plans may have been drafted up before hand. Think about the planning and massive organization required for any military action.

It is probably easy for you to imagine that Putin is using the cover of this tragedy to take out targets of Russian interest. But is it just as easy to believe that the French would use the cover of this tragedy to boost their economy?

You see, this all comes back to monetary policy. Global economy is stuttering and the tried and true method to boost the economy is massive war spending. This is the end stage of inflationary monetary policy. To attempt to save the economy, the EU central bank is planning another round of ""Quantitative Easing"" (printing money). EU governments will borrow this printed money at interest from the ECB (European Central Bank). The governments will use this money to pay defense agencies. The defense money trickles through most of the economy. This is why at any job you've worked at you've never been that far away from a defense contract. The governments will also use this money to help pay down their current debt to the ECB. Yes that is right, they are borrowing more money from the ECB to help pay off previous loans from the ECB. 

There is no magic here, it is destined to fail. Just like getting a 4th credit card to pay off your 3rd, that pays off your 2nd, that pays off the first card. This system will fail and in its death-throws will become outrageously violent. In this process everyone's savings becomes worth less due to inflation. Inflation steals from you to kill and destroy.

The monetary system literally inflicts violence on the world to survive. It is a parasite. Many problems of the world are simply failures of human nature. Not the monetary system. The monetary system is a deliberate, systemic conspiracy to steal wealth from everyone. It uses fear to promote violence as a solution to the worlds problems.

Bitcoin represents a more fair monetary system. No authority is given the power to print money. The power to create money in bitcoin is directly tied to how much an entity protects the network. Selfish greed is tied to selfless act of securing the network.

France could not go to war in a world based on bitcoin, at least not like this.

Since bitcoin cannot be conjured up out of the thin air like fiat money is, France would need a loan of capital. Instead of just freely printing the money, the ECB would actually have to take bitcoin off its books and transfer it to France. But the ECB would only do so if they felt whatever France was using the money for would allow them to pay it back. As it currently stands when a country doesn't have enough to pay off its debt, it simply gets more debt. That was that whole ordeal in Greece. The people said they didn't want more debt, that they wanted out of the EU, but instead more debt was forced on them, debt they will never be able to repay. And what happens when it truly comes crashing down? Will the ECB and creditor nations assert ownership over Greece itself? Why is it that central banks are happy to give so much debt to countries they cannot possibly pay it back? Because they are giving something away that is conjured up out of thin air in exchange for ownership of that territory in the future.

Just like in 2008 when all those poor banks made bad mortgages to people who could never hope to repay them. The bank conjured up money in the form of debt, the individual uses this debt-money to pay for a house. The individual fails to repay conjured money, the bank ends up with a house. So the bank starts with nothing, creates something out of thin air, and then ends up with real-estate, destroying credit and lives in the process.

The trace-ability of Bitcoin can also prevent large scale corruption. Unlike cash, bitcoin transactions are recorded in an immutable ledger. Each fraction of a coin can be traced all the way back to the moment it was ""mined"". Governments or corporations would need to be very careful using large amounts of bitcoin for nefarious purposes, since it is easily traceable. Unfortunately this is one of the major downsides to bitcoin too.


Fiat money is maintained through violence. The value of your dollars represents violence that the government can inflict upon others. De-vest from dollars. I wouldn't recommend investing significantly into any one thing, but I wouldn't hold dollars.

Just trying to help a friend understand, and I'm having trouble with the math.  (No matter what they tell you kids, you don't really use it that often after school and then you lose it)

He has some money in a savings account.  We'll say it's $10k and he's getting 1.5% interest, compounded monthly, on it.

He also has a $7k loan with an interest rate of 5.7%.  He is on a fixed term (12 month) payment plan.

Let's say he takes $7k out of his savings account and pays of the loan, thus no longer paying 5.7% interest, but also no longer getting monthly compounded 1.5% interest on that $7k, but paying himself BACK + 2.7% interest monthly into the savings account that has 1.5% interest.

How does that work out?  Since this is an example with fake numbers, I'm hoping for the formula rather than the answer...

Thank you in advance!

**My story** is that I’m a 25 year old college student. I started school at 18 right out of high school but had a series of failed semesters due in large part to my own misconduct and lack of focus. I switched my major now 3 times and in doing so have accumulated over 110 attempted credit hours. I’m not at 110 attempted with 90 credit hours passed. My grades have improved significantly and I now have a 3.5 gpa with another high grade semester almost in the books and getting close to my associates in applied science for physical therapy assistant.

**My Problem** is that I can afford to pay to complete this associates degree in physical therapy assistant out of pockets (at much pain and suffering) but for any future education in physical therapy or chiropractor I’m looking at $8,000 to $12,000 per semester, which I can’t even begin to dream of affording. Due to my large amount of attempted credit hours I have essentially disqualified myself from federal student aid, and after multiple visits to the school financial aid office for help or guidance I have received less than helpful information, being told “You’ll never qualify for federal aid, and your only hope is probably a private loan or scholarships.”

personalfinance,Seven percent down on a house.,"First time home buyer here. 
I live in a competitive real estate market and am currently looking to buy a home for 290k. My main issue is that I only have just over 20k in savings i'd be willing to put down after closing costs, appraisal, and inspections while still maintaining a small emergency fund (which I would build back up to 3-4 months worth soon after the purchase). 
I'm looking at a total monthly payment (including pmi) of 1800 a month. My girlfriend, who I live with now and will live in the house with me, will pay about 800 in rent to me, and I'll cover the rest. Right now I'm able to save about 1700 a month (without trying very hard) with my portion of the rent being 650. So my rent/house payment would increase by about 350 and my savings would automatically decrease to 1350 per month. On top of that I understand that there are costs associated with homeownership that will dwarf my current bills and expenses. However, the house I'm looking at seems to be in great condition with a small yard and brand new roof. I know there are no guarantees, but I'm trying my best to purchase something low maintenance to help minimize costs. 
My take home pay is about 3700 a month, I don't have any student loan debt, credit card debt, or a car payment, and I'm diligent about maxing out my roth ira every year (however I don't want to dip into retirement to help cover more down payment). 
I hate the idea of paying so much in pmi ($120 per month), but I don't want to wait another year or two just to save more money for the down payment, because housing prices in my city are expected to climb much higher, and interest rates are still extremely low. Can I justify a down payment this low?",finance,1448037904

I started the job 3 pay cycles ago so 2 pay checks since they hold 2 weeks I believe. Up until this point I have worked serving/bartending tip jobs in a small tourist town. Budgeting was pretty non-existent for me. If bills were due I would work doubles over the weekend to pay them. Any money other than that was mine to spend.

I am on my second paycheck from the new job and really struggling trying to pace out my money over two weeks. Starting pay is around $16 an hour getting around 20-30 hours a week. My living expenses come out to around $350 a month. I am also a smoker a pack a day which takes around $96~ every paycheck. I have no car payment only insurance which is about $80~ a month. Doing the math this should not be this difficult. 

One thing that throws me off every check is the amount of money I am losing in taxes. Between federal, state, medicare, and ss I am losing 21% of the gross pay. Is this normal or did I put a wrong number in the box on the paperwork? I also don't make any really large purchases but the money still just seems to trickle through my fingers like water.

Tax questions within!,"So, my significant other has an old IRA with a company they used to work for a few years ago. We now have this IRA, with around 8.5k in it, and we are trying to think of what to do with it. The IRA, a profit sharing thing, has offered us two choices: (1) transfer the money to a new IRA or retirement account and keep 100% of it or (2) withdraw the amount now, with 20% going into federal withholding. 

Normally, I'd recommend the first option hands down, as saving 2k now is a big deal in the long run. However, my significant other has spent several months this year unemployed or employed part time, and the thought crossed my mind that because they have earned so little during this past year (less than 15k), that the withholding (or at least some significant proportion of it) would eventually come back after taxes. However, it is possible that there is something going on with this type of withholding that will not take into account my significant other's yearly income when considering taxation.

So, the questions are the following: (1) will the money withheld due to this early withdraw come back after taxes? (2) if not, are there any recommendations for non-employer attached retirement accounts (or similar programs) that we could form to transfer this into?

I know people have done this before by taking out a loan for a large stock market investment or real estate investment, but can this work with peer-to-peer lending?  *Is it even legal to do so?*

If you're a borrower, Prosper works by determining your creditworthiness (rated AA for lowest risk through HR for highest risk) and then quoting you an interest rate accordingly.  Then individual lenders can decide whether to invest in your loan (from small amounts to large amounts) given the information provided by you and credit bureaus.

If you're an investor, then you can choose from a large listing of listings in which to invest.  You get to decide which ones based on your own criteria.

Let's say I have excellent credit and have an AA rating.  What are the possible implications of, say, borrowing $10,000 at a low interest rate and the lending that money back out on either the same website or a similar peer-to-peer lending website to individuals with lower credit ratings (with higher possible ROI for the lender)?

However, the convenience of owning my own car certainly seems worth the relatively small cost of $5-7k plus gas and maintenance.

Expenses - $1900mo.


(Exactly...)


Vehicle 1 - 2005 Lexus ES330 

I owe $10,500 to Navy Federal at 9%.
Vehicle is worth about $7000 based off comparable craigslist ads

• Pristine Condition, interior is basically NEW

• Needs power steering belt &amp; wheel bearing ($300)

• 150,000 Miles but runs like it's brand new

___________________________________________________________________

Vehicle 2 - 2000 Audi TT Quattro 5sp

I owe $7,500 to Navy Federal at 8%
Vehicle is worth about $5,000 based off comparable craigslist ads

• 115,000 Miles and running strong

• Will need several thousand in maint. costs in the next 1-2yr.

• Personally I love this car and how it drives

_____________________________________________________________________

To summarize, I owe $18,000 on two vehicles that have a combined worth of $12,000.

I obviously can't keep this going for much longer, I need to sell one of these vehicles and keep the other, or figure out a way to trade both in, and finance ONE car that is more aligned with its actual market value.

Payments for both cars are as follows

• $365 for both vehicles combined

• $165 for Insurance (combined)

• $100 for gas (combined).


What would you do in this situation? I can't really sell them because they're underwater and not worth what's needed to pay off the loans.

Thanks guys.",finance,1448082206
personalfinance,Is putting a bonus toward my credit card debt the only reasonable thing to do?,"I have about 3k of credit card debt.  It used to be over 4k and I've been paying it down *really* slowly just making the minimum payment.  I recently started making a bit more money at a new job and I can throw an extra $100-$300 dollars at it every month depending on how much overtime I get.  My interest rate is pretty gnarly, about 14%, because I was late a couple times.

I know I'm getting a bonus next month that should be about 1k, and taking a chunk out of my debt seems like the obvious smart choice.  The thing is, I'm in a new place and I have no furniture or anything.  I do a bit of woodworking as a hobby and there's some tools I've wanted for years but never had the disposable income to afford.  I have this idea I'm really excited about of using the bonus to buy some decent tools, up my woodworking game and build myself some furniture.  I even have a lot of the wood I need.   

Some days I wake up and think ""I'm doing better financially now, I'm going to be able to pay my debt off in a year or two max, I've wanted these tools for years it's not an impulse buy, woodworking brings a lot of enjoyment to my life and having some furniture which hopefully is better than thrift store junk would be great, etc.""

Other days I just think: pay off this damn credit card as fast as possible, spending money on anything else is not allowed unless it's necessary.  

I guess what I'm wondering is, when I have some extra money, and I'm pretty stable financially, is it reasonable to spend it on something that will make my pretty spartan living situation more enjoyable or do I need to just buckle down and pay off this debt asap?  Sorry if this is kind of too vague or philosophical a question.  Just wondering what people's thoughts are about bonuses and this sort of thing.",finance,1448082949
personalfinance,Trying to rebuild credit. Buy a car or not?,"Hello PersonalFinance,

First, a little about myself. At a young age, I screwed up my credit. Got married early, and screwed it up even more. Now I have a great paying job, and can afford making all of my payments on time, and I have. My credit score is somewhere around the 580s (Which is horrible, I know.) I have 3 vehicles, which are paid off, and my mobile home is paid off as well. I have a few credit cards that gives me a total of $1000 limit, which I currently have at around 60%. I'm currently working with a credit repair company, and they have already started disputes with 11 of my past creditors.

Now here's my question....

I was told that I need either a mortgage or a car payment to raise my credit up. So I've been preapproved for a car loan but with a 18% interest rate from an online car lender. 

I already have a car picked out, and I can definitely make the payments on it easy ($400 a month for 72 months), and I don't mind paying it. However, my ultimate goal here is to eventually purchase a home hopefully in a year's time.

So, do I purchase the car? Will it help me a great deal if I make the payments on time? Having a newer car will be nice, since my other cars are around 2007. Thoughts?",finance,1448083357

personalfinance,"Unexpectedly earning $$ from stocks, how do I to calculate how much is earned after taxes and how much is owed to the IRS? Is my resulting MAGI too high to contribute to my Roth IRA?","The company where I work was recently bought in a cash tender offer and the purchasing company will buy our stocks outright. (FYI I’m 25 and earn $56.7k/year.)

At their purchase price, I will receive just over $177,000 before taxes. From what my colleagues have said, it seems that the capital gain will be taxed on a ‘short-term’ basis. This means that federal income tax brackets are used to determine the capital gain, right? So, the tax will be $18,481.25+(177,450.75-90,751)*0.28 = $42,757.18 and my ‘income’ from the stock will be $134,693.57?

This means that I’ll have to pay taxes on my annual income and the ‘stock income’ (56,650+134,700) – right? – and need to plan to have that much money set aside accordingly?

With the money, I was hoping to pay off remaining student loans and max out my retirement contributions – but, I was reading that if my modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is above $136,000 I couldn’t contribute to my Roth IRA. Does this mean I would have to take the backdoor method mentioned in the PF FAQ? 

(FYI The deduction from student loan interest is minimal – about $400 at most.)

Once I've squared away my student loan debt and retirement contributions, I want to look into a three-fund portfolio or balanced index fund, but that'll likely come in another post. :)",finance,1448112330
personalfinance,Advice on offset mortgage?,"I recently bought a house worth 695,000 with a mortgage of 550k on a variable rate mortgage. I have since come into around 140k cash and need to decide what to do with it (it's currently sitting in my bank account)

One idea I am considering is an offset mortgage, keeping the money in a linked savings account so I don't have to pay interest on the equivalent amount of my mortgage. This will save me approx 300/month (which I would reinvest in other savings) or would allow me to significantly reduce the mortgage term. The other advantage of this approach as I see it is the flexibility - I can easily access some or all of this cash at any time if needed. Meanwhile it is providing me with a relatively high ""yield"". The disadvantage is a slightly inferior (.1%) interest rate. I am almost certainly going to take out a 5 year fixed rate deal whether I go the offset route or not.

Any advice on whether this is a good approach, warnings or alternative suggestions to invest the money? While my wife and I both have pensions, this money amounts to our ""life savings""",finance,1448116037

The portfolio is in need of value protection due to being a bit overweight in energy this past year. 

BND seemed like a good way to provide a little stable value to the portfolio, but I was wondering what people think the effects of the Fed announcing interest rate hikes would be to the price of this ETF? (or the bond market in general)  Ideally, I hope the price dips down a few %'s on the news, and then recovers in the coming day's/weeks.  Or, would it be logical to expect BND to continue to track downward in the coming years as interest rates continue to rise?",finance,1448122767

personalfinance,Don't know where to save for down payment,"I've saved up a lot of money for a down-payment on a house, but the house prices in my area are extremely high right now, and I can't justify the monthly payments for the quality of the houses. I've been keeping the money in my savings account, but I feel that I'm losing a lot of potential for the money to grow. I'm looking for a new place to store my money. 

I have about 95k in savings. I was planning on keeping 15k as an emergency fund, 60k for a downpayment on a 300k house (to avoid PMI), and 13k for closing and 7k for maybe a 1- or 2-room renovation (many of the houses I've been looking at have had the same kitchens for 30 years). The problem is that in order for me to live within 25 minutes of work, housing is around 350k for houses that are smaller than I wanted, mostly with 200-300/mth association. Any farther than that, and I'd prefer to stay at home (45 min away w/o traffic), which is significantly cheaper for me. I feel that buying a house now would make me house-broke, and that would suck after barely spending any of my money at all to save up for this house after several years. 

I plan on saving some more for the next year or two in the hopes that I either get a better raise, the housing market comes to it's senses again, or I get fed up and move to an area where I can afford a house. I'd like to keep the money relatively liquid. 

Options I've considered so far:

* Put it into a high-yield savings accounts (ally has 1% interest on online savings)
* Put the money into 2 low-cost studio and/or 1/1 apartments. Make about $300-$400 profit per place, and use that money to offset the cost of rent in a 2/2 or 3/2 w/ roommates.
* Using an online ""robo-advisor"" like betterment.com or wealthfront.com with 40/60 stocks/bond split (makes me a little uneasy, though, since 60% of the money isn't liquid)

Options that I'm not comfortable with:

* all in to the stock market. I can't afford the risk of losing that money, since I would like to withdraw it within the next 1-2 years.

personalfinance,"Getting divorced, I[34/m] am cosigned on $29,000 of her[32/f] student loans, what are my options?","She has approximately $84,000 in student loans total and no other debt. She will be graduating soon, and will hopefully get a decent paying job in the nursing field (Bachelors of Nursing), though for the first time she will have a full host of living expenses too.

I get it, I cosigned, I might be on the hook for this. We were married and planning for a better life when the first 2 loans were signed, and the 3rd was about the time we separated and were still trying to work it out... I'm not whining here, I'll pay it if I have to, but just wanting to know if I had options I'm not aware of.

I am worried that she will not properly keep these student loans paid up to date, but am not sure what recourse or options I have during the divorce to counter that fear, other then potentially end up paying for these $29,000 myself. I make $150,000/yr, it's not going to destroy my life if I have to pay them, but its never fun to throw money away, basically.

In our discussions, she asked me to help her out by paying the payment on these loans for the first year while she establishes herself and gets her life in order. She has said she will pay all the loans on time every month, but I know how she gets when things get tough and I want to protect my credit score...

The paperwork will be drawn up next week, so just wanted to see if I should consider putting something specific in it as part of the divorce in regards to these loans.

These loans I am cosigned on are Sallie Mae Smart Option loans, there are 3 of them, 2 at 6.75% and 1 at 8.5% interest.

Will she be able to consolidate these loans and take my name of them once she has income? 

If she can't consolidate them for any reason, and if I can't remove my name, can I consolidate them so at least it's a better interest rate if I'm going to get stuck paying them? And if so, should I just do it in my name, so I know it gets paid and then just ""hope"" she pays me back directly?

Do I have any other legal options in the divorce I should consider in regards to these loans? (I'll talk to a lawyer as well, just looking for options)

personalfinance,I need a little help with debt consolidation...,"So, my car broke down one day. I had only just recently started my new job, and I was totally broke. I ended up taking out a $2500 loan (that was the smallest amount Discovery would give me) at a 22% interest rate. Totally insane, but I needed to fix my car ASAP. At this point I had already missed three days of work.

Ended up getting fired from that job because of missing too much work. I used only what I needed off the debt once I got it, and immediately paid $800 back, which is all that was left.

Now I've got a new job, which pays way less, but at least I have steady income again. I make around $1400 a month, and essential monthly expenses are roughly $800 (rent, gas, utilities, car insurance). I live with my boyfriend who buys most of the food and has been paying rent, since I've been struggling financially the last few months.

My problem is that I'm saving up to move to go to school in March, and I want to save as much as possible for the truck, insurance, gas, etc. I already pay student loans, which is made up of three federal loans totalling $9300. Interest rates are 4.5% on $3000, 3.4% on $4700, and 6.8% on $1200. I'm currently making payments of $116 a month. I've already asked for a forbearance on my student loans for a few months.

Is debt consolidation a good idea for the 22% loan? I'm 22, with a 650 credit score. My credit score was 720 a month ago, but took a nose dive due to all the hard credit inquiries when I was trying to find a place that would let me take out a loan. My credit history isn't even 2 years old yet, which I think is a big factor in why I had a tough time getting a loan. I also have a credit card with a $1000 limit, and I'm using $980 of it. It's been stuck like that for a good two years. Seems like every time I pay off a decent chunk, I need emergency money and use that. But I have no derogatory remarks, and my payment history is 100%. 

What is a good company to take out a consolidation debt with? Or is there something else I could try? I know I'm probably panicking way more than I need to, and I'd really appreciate some suggestions!",finance,1448136896

Option 1: Graduate and go to Law School. I have taken a few classes on law and find it very interesting, especially criminal law. 

Pro's: 

* A law degree would make me more valuable, therefore increasing my chances for federal law enforcement
* Creates the option of being a lawyer if law enforcement does not work out 
* From the classes I have taken I found criminal law fascinating and I'm doing really good in the class (which is supposedly structured and run like an actual law school lecture would be)

Con's: 

* The cost of going to law school 
* I have no doubt it will be very challenging and competitive 
* The continual uncertainty of employment (Law degree does not certainly guarantee employment)
* I cannot be sure at this point that law is something I am going to want to do or even be able to do 

Option 2: Graduate become a police officer. I would most likely be looking at a larger police department. I have done an internship with a decently large police department and found it overall enjoyable. 

Pro's: 

* Get straight to working (gain money instead of accruing more loans)
* The experience in local law enforcement could be a gateway to federal law enforcement
* From my experiences I enjoyed police work.
* The opportunity to be promoted to other tasks (such as a detective which I am very interested in)

Con's:

* Starting salary is very low at most departments
* Will I be stuck there forever? Nothing against life time police officers, but I don't think that is me. I am afraid I will join a police department and find it to be a dead end. 

Please let me know what you think I should do. Also if you have experience as a police officer, lawyer, or federal agent please feel free to give me any advice that you think would be helpful. And if you think I got any of the information above incorrect let me know. Thank you in advance for your help!

TL;DR I am graduating soon and need to decide between going to law school or being a police officer with the main goal of getting into federal law enforcement.",finance,1448137062

personalfinance,Is your credit score supposed to consistently go up if you pay CC's and Car Payment?,"This might be a dumb question. I had my credit score pulled 2 years ago when I was buying my car. It was 740 or thereabout for all 3 bureaus. I have 3 credit cards, and I use one about every other month for groceries and gas and pay it off fully at the end of the month after the statement comes in. Both of the others CC's get some action every month too (uber, and gym membership) to keep them active. I never have more than 10% of the limit racked up before paying it off (and again, I never pay interest or pay late). 

I've been making payments every month on my car as well. 

I check credit karma every so often. My credit is 740 on one bureau and 742 on another. Shouldn't it gradually go up as my accounts age and as I continue making on time payments? Or is it normal for it to happen more gradually? I don't plan on buying a home right away, but if I'm able to save enough then I'd like to be in a strong position in maybe 5 or so years. But there doesn't seem to be any signs of progress on the credit side so wondering what i might be doing wrong.

Maybe my parent being a co-owner on the car (to get better interest rate) is preventing that monthly payment from helping my credit. Its all a mystery to me.",finance,1448154508

Like most credit card, loans, car loan, etc offers I scoffed at it and threw it into the shredding pile. Later it caught me that it was in fact a lot of money. 

A little about me - early 20s, ~90-130k income (varies), low expenses, mid-life car, no rent currently, good health insurance, around 15k in student loans left at between 2-6%, credit score 800+, about 50k of credit through cards available.

I'm wondering what reason there would be for me to think about taking this/a personal loan? Mortgages have lower rates for homes, auto loans are much lower. If I had high interest student loans, sure. Googled most of the answers and none really applied. The only logic I saw that *might* be reasonable is to invest it, but I don't know enough to guarantee 5.5% returns.

investing,"At this point, the Fed is 'damned if they do, damned if they don't'","After it released the minutes of its October Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, it became ever clearer that the Federal Reserve is setting itself up for an interest-rate hike in December.

The market has already priced in a high probability for the liftoff from zero percent interest rates (68% as of Friday). Many economists are also forecasting December.

According to Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel, the Fed has without a doubt set up expectations for next month but also put itself in a terrible position.

""Some say policymakers have backed themselves into a corner and will raise rates in December in order to save face with the markets,"" Piegza wrote this week in a note to clients. ""Of course, raising rates with half of the Fed’s mandate – stable prices – not yet met, also risks the Fed’s credibility.""

Piegza said the Fed has talked up the possibility of a rate hike in 2015 so much that not doing so would make investors and markets lose all trust in its word.

The problem, according to Piegza, is that inflation has still not hit 2% growth — which is one of the Fed's two mandates along with full employment — and likely won't by next month's meeting.

At this point, Piegza seems to have lost faith in the FOMC's outlook.

""The Fed continues to anticipate conditions will warrant a rate increase by the end of the year: 1) just as they have for years and 2) meaning conditions don't currently satisfy the needed justification for liftoff,"" she wrote in a follow-up note Thursday.

Not only has Piegza begun to question the Fed, but she also expects there is a real chance that the rest of the world will do so as well. Here's Piegza (emphasis added):

At this point, the Fed's credibility is on the line. If the Fed doesn't raise rates in December, they risk the market's interpretation of an unfounded 'promise' to do so and further distrust of monetary policymakers down the line. Of course, if they do raise rates in December despite a lack of momentum in the economy, they risk having to admit an improper policy move should inflation remain stubbornly low for some time or the economy slows further, forcing the Fed to lower rates soon after a rate increase. In other words, they are damned if they do, damned if they don't.
For what it's worth, Piegza thinks the Fed will get out of the pickle by not raising rates in December and focusing on ""underlying data and not the calendar.""",finance,1448192029

personalfinance,Rent vs Buy: What about when grants and tax incentives come into play?,"I am looking for some advice in this situation.  I am a 24 yr old, making roughly 100k, a 3% DTI ratio, and a 780 credit score.  I am considering buying a house, but trying to be analytical and sensible about this at the same time.  I live in Baltimore City, which may not be your typical chic metropolitan US city, but it happens to be a place where it tends to be much cheaper to own than rent.  1 bedrooms rent for usually about 1,100-1,800 depending on the neighborhood, and it often costs more for parking.  Splitting rent on a house with roommates helps.  I lived with roommates for 5 years, but it always led to me moving every single year and it was getting expensive, but more than that extremely stressful and time consuming.  I now rent a loft style 500 square foot studio apartment for $1280 a month in a great neighborhood, and pay $145 a month to park my car.  Paying extra to live alone in this location is still 100% worth it to me.

Young working professionals have driven up the cost of nice urban apartments.  The city has a group of home buying incentives for people meeting certain requirements.  This past fall they rolled out a program that includes a no strings $7,500 grant for first time homebuyers for down payment and closing assistance, a interest rate of 4.125% with a 4.601% APR for a conventional loan (no idea if this is good for me, haven't shopped for lenders that much), and a tax credit program where you receive $2,000 federal tax credit each year you live in the home for the life of the loan which doesn't vanish when you exceed certain income restrictions.  The program only included 400 grants, and currently 255 still remain.  I suspect they won't last through the year.  This on top of being able to deduct interest and property taxes would be nice.  

Downside is property taxes in Baltimore SUCK; it is 2.1% of assessed value.  Most houses I am looking at is about $3,500-$4,500 a year.

I've been looking at homes, and obviously I'm getting starry eyed.  I could have so much more for roughly what I'm paying in rent, but it's a commitment.  I could get a 2-3 bedroom, 2 bath nicely renovated house for the cost of my studio.  I've been in Baltimore for 6 years and I love, and I'm working part time on my PhD so I'll definitely be chained here awhile.   I am also considering renting a spare bedroom to another grad student to reduce my living costs.  

Downside is I'm young and still fresh-ish out of school.  I can't comfortably put down 20% on a house, so I'll be punished with PMI.  On other hand, if I don't act soon, I'll lose out on the grant and tax credit incentive.  Even if they do a similar incentive in the future there are income limits on these things, and my income is already borderline.  Mortgage calculators (like Zillow's with PMI and property tax) still estimate I could get a house I would be very happy with for the cost of my rent. Looks like, NYT favors buying for basically anything longer than 3 years in my situation.  

I know this subreddit tends to firmly believe in 20% down.  The amount I would receive for the federal tax credit alone (not including what I save from deductions) is actually slightly higher than the amount I would be paying annually for PMI by about $300.  I'm just looking for some advice in this situation.",finance,1448205234

Basically, after a terrible experience with H&amp;R block and a desire to avoid paying for what I can do myself, I want to know what the best way to do my 2015 taxes electronically is.

1) Know every single thing I can deduct from my taxes
2) The cheapest, freest way I can do this electronically so I don't have to deal with paper or mail


**Some Specifics about me**

2) I live in the state of Missouri and my employer is located in the state of Missouri
3) I travel for work and my employer pays me per diem
4) I sold a car in May of this year and bought another in October 
5) I have been using this car to travel for work and getting reimbursed 50cents per mile, but not for gas; corollary: I understand the federal reimbursement rate is 57.5 cpm and that I can deduct this difference - accurate?
6) I have also signed up to Uber in my city of residence (Kansas City, Missouri) but have not completed the process - if I am able to complete the process by the end of 2015, can I deduct the cost of the car I use as a business expense?
7) I have student loans and have already paid the maximum interest deduction in 2015 ($2500)

personalfinance,Can I just check my understanding of IRAs quickly...,"Here is what I think I know about IRAs (in this case, it's a traditional IRA, but maybe roths work differently). Please correct me wherever I am wrong. I'm trying to figure out if my credit union is actually a good choice to provide an IRA or if the highest growth potential comes from a company like Vanguard. This is the info I've gotten out of my research on IRAs so far, including the retirement FAQ on this board:

An IRA is simply defined as an account with a tax advantage. So depending on who you choose to open your IRA with, you might have it just be a simple account with little to no growth (say, an account with quarterly compounding on a variable interest rate), a CD (very safe option with slightly better interest rate), or investment in some combination of stocks, bonds, etc. (which has the highest potential for growth, especially if the investor is putting money in starting at age 26).

So if my credit union is offering either the option of a Quarterly Share Account (the only description I can find is, ""With a IRA Quarterly Share, there is no minimum to open the account, and you earn a variable interest rate, which is compounded and credited quarterly."" - this works out to about .15-17% interest) or an IRA CD (up to 1.6% interest), my best option for future growth will be to move my money to a company that will actually invest it, and I should potentially choose a target date fund if I'm not big on researching and keeping up with all my investments. This growth potential easily overcomes the fees that would come with transferring and/or managing my money, and investing nearly always significantly outstrips a simple interest rate over a long-term investment.

Is that a fair assessment? Or am I way, way off?

Thanks so much for your help and clarification! This board is the best resource for double checking stuff like this :)",finance,1448209562

personalfinance,I need investment advice on purchasing a new home for my young family. Do my thoughts make sense?,"Hello Reddit,

My wife and I have considerations for purchasing a house together and we have narrowed the list down to 3 potential candidates (known as House A, B, and C) which could potentially change based on the current availability of homes and future considerations.  I would like to ask some general questions as it related to the investments of housing.  I will do my very best to concise in my questions so that they are easy to answer and so that you are best able to assist my wife and me.

1.  What consideration do you have for the year the property was built?  I really like newer properties.  The 3 houses we like were built in 2005 (A), 2015 (B), and 2011 (C).

2.  How flexible are the asking prices in your experience?  The cost of the houses are listed at $284,500 (A), $279,900 (B), and $279,900 (C).  We were hoping to get a house for less than $275,000 because of our financial situation which I will explain at the bottom of this post.

3.  How badly can the neighborhood affect the future value of the property?  House C has what we consider to be the most family-friendly neighberhood but they are building new apartments across the street and we're told that this will affect the future value of the property.  House A is very close to a trailer park and House B is in a very new subdivision.

4.  Can your real estate agent affect how good of a deal we get because of his own personal concern of commissions?  We want to get the very best deal on the home, and I am personally concerned (my wife is not) that we will not be able to get the very best deal on a property because he has his own personal interests above what is truly best for the client.  I like to think that the broker does not have a fiduciary responsibility to us.

5.  Can I use my rental property's address to allow my children into specific school districts?  There are homes of great consideration because they offer considerable upgrades in comparison to what we could get elsewhere but our children would have to go to a school that we would find to be a ""deal breaker."" 

6.  What are some bargaining tools we can use to get a better deal on the house we buy?  House A is the complete package but I just don't like it as much as the others (it doesn't feel like ""home""), whereas House B was built this year but the landscaping is not done and will not be included in the final costs, and House C has the most room but the concern is that it could be a bad investment because of the future buildings that are constructed across the street.

7.  What should I be asking you that I haven't considered?  House C does not have a crawl space and I don't know if that should concern me.  Houses A, B, and C only have 3 bedrooms and we plan on having 3 children and potentially needing 4 bedrooms at a future date.  Is it normal or appropriate to live in a house for only 5 years with the intentions of reselling and upgrading?  What are the most important things to be aware of that would affect the future value of the home you buy?

Here is some information about my wife and I.  My wife is currently a stay-at-home mom that receives a very trivial income as a part-time babysitter. I work in a niche part of the financial services industry (annuities, if anyone wanted to know) as a wholesaler.  I receive a modest income, but would receive additional income from my rental property (a condominium) where we currently live.  I just refinanced my condominium to a reasonable 15-year fixed interest rate that I plan to use the income from after the mortgage is paid off to get my children through college.

Expect chop and high spreads Thursday and Friday across most pairs, as the USD touches everything.

For **USD**, Monday is important as both GDP and consumer confidence come out; I suspect that the data will show increasing USD strength; this is of course right before ""Black Friday"", so happy news might mean happy spending, which might mean elevation on USD pairs.

Currently, I'm taking classes for my graduates in finance, though I'm only taking the max hours that my job will pay for. I'm 24 years old and I'm working in global loans making about $54,000 a year. Right now, I'm just staying at home with my parents saving my money and building some equity. I've got about $30,000 saved up and will have close to 40,000 or so by the time I'm ready to purchase the property. My credit score is 780 and I'm a resident in Delaware. 

My plan is to purchase a townhouse for around $200,000 or so. Here is a link to some houses for sale within my area so you can have an understanding on what I'd be purchasing.http://www.homes.com/for-sale/wilmington-de/townhouses/?additionalCities=NEW%20CASTLE_DELAWARE%20CITY_SAINT%20GEORGES_NEWARK_BEAR_ODESSA_TOWNSEND_MIDDLETOWN_HOCKESSIN_CLAYMONT&amp;maxprice=215000&amp;minprice=180000&amp;orderby=price%20desc
 
I think 1700 square feet is a good average for these houses. Now with a house of this quality I think I could charge about 1400-1450 a month in rent. This link here has town homes for rent with similar qualities. http://www.homes.com/rentals/new-castle-county-de/townhouses/?orderby=beds%20desc

Now I plan on taking out a mortgage for this house. I'll be putting up $30,000 and financing $170,000. The mortgage will be a 30 year mortgage and I've calculated this with a %4 interest rate (which is fair given the prime market for rental property in my state).

Now if you would, please see the attached spreadsheet I've created that shows my mortgage calculation along with how I plan on budgeting with this investment. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K8D1Eq1Q4DPUy8zgBEIxoCJVrg4Y7a21rOq_s4j8UdA/pubhtml

Let me explain my reasoning behind these calculation...So I've budgeted for the following...1) Mortgage payments: This probably needs no explanation 2) Repairs: This is where it gets complicated as repairs are often unpredictable. You may go 10 years without ever having a problem and BAM! Now need a new roof and you're looking at a $12,000 dollar bill. I've read most people budget 1% of the home's FMV yearly for repairs. So 1% of my $200,000 property comes to about $2,000 a year or 167 monthly. 3) Property Taxes: So I've done the research and in New Castle County DE property taxes for a town home like this are an estimated $1,100 dollars a year or $92 a month. 4) Homeowners insurance: Houses in my area cost an average of $60 a month. 5) Property management fees: I work 50 hours a week, I simply find it easier to have a management company find tenants, background checks, ext. I figure having them do these tasks is well worth the price I'd pay. I've read these companies typically charge 8-12% of what you're charging the tenet for rent, some even charge flat rate costs of $100 per month. I calculated the $112 amount by taking 8% of $1400. 6) Months without a Tenet: This is where it gets risky with your invest...What I've done is take 2 months of mortgage and factored this into my monthly budgeting. This means 2 months of EVERY year owning the property I budget on not having a Tenant for 2 of them. I know this could be more, it could be less....But I feel 2 months a year is reasonable. The $135 dollar amount is factoring 2 months without a rent check, I feel it made sense to put this into my monthly budgeting. When you factor all these costs I expect to make a $30 dollar profit at the end of every month (though I know this wont always be the case).

So in 30 years I own the property and look to sell it....If I'm offered a fair price I may sell the house before the 30 year period. I also have a good friend from my high school who does contracting and is willing to help me if needed. 

I ask you guys, am I being realistic about this? Do you think my budgeting is unreasonable, am I missing a few things? Does anyone here own property and if so how are things going for you? I really appreciate any criticism, even if it's a bit rough. If you're going to invest in something this expensive it only makes sense to hear the good and bad.

software,[Request/Vent] iTunes/Spotify replacement,"We all know how annoying and bloated iTunes is. When first I learned of Spotify, it looked like my new preferred music app.

Fast forward a year+ ago, Spotify has removed everything that was good about it (like being able to purchase obscure/ish CDs from artists that never made it big outside their own borders) and is instead a worse-than-iTunes clone.

I'm so fed up with these two music programs; they either refuse to properly handle my local (!) files or force me to listen to 'online replacements' so I get ads between tracks, or the updated info added to tracks is wrong (I'm very finicky about this, I try to stay 100% correct about specific tracks and remixes, who remixed them and the original artist etc.) and I can't re-replace it.

I'm now trying to move my library into MusicBee, manually because apparently some files are reported as either broken or simply not there despite my confirming that they do exist on my PC and they are indeed not broken (just possibly not a supported file by MusicBee?) and it's starting to feel like it's just not worth it and I should just give up on my 2000+ file archive of various music tracks. My patience is, I will admit, very limited right now and I really just want to listen to my music without too much effort on my part to get the details correctly

TL;DR - I need ideas on replacements worthy of the simple looks of earlier versions of iTunes and Spotify, that preferably are not bloaty or shitty, that will play most Audio files. I'm on a windows Vista pc (I'm a pleb, sorry) and I'd love any and all suggestions, especially if the music player has skins. The simpler the player, the better as I am not a clever woman.

Thanks in advance, /r/Software, for listening to my plight.",technology,1448227850
personalfinance,401K and backdoor Roth IRA questions!,"31M. I've been educating myself about PF for the past 6 months. I've read the FAQ many times, I apologize if I missed anything.

I recently received a significant promotion. In 2015, I will make ~115K. In 2016, I will make 172K (150K base, 22K quarterly bonus). I have a question about my 401K and setting up an IRA.


* My employer matches 50% of my contribution up to the Federal maximum. However, they do not allow me to specify a fixed contribution -- I have to specify a percentage of my income. They take a contribution from all semi-monthly checks and all bonus payments. HR ""thinks"" they will stop funding the account once I reach the federal maximum. My question is, should I specify 10%, 11% or 12% of my salary? Leaning towards 12% so that I have more money working for me earlier in the year.

* I made less than income limit for a Roth IRA in 2015. I know I have until April of 2016 to contribute to a Roth IRA for 2015. If I open a Roth IRA and contribute $5500, what can I do in 2016? I don't currently have an IRA, so I was planning on opening a traditional IRA and backdooring it into a Roth IRA in 2016. If I do that, how do I continue to contribute each year after that? Do I have to make a backdoor contribution each year?

* Currently saving up ~200K for an eventual down payment on 5/1 ARM or 15 yr. fixed mortgage. I normally keep 1-2K extra in Checking, 15K in 1% savings and the rest goes into the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSMX). Is this reasonable for someone expecting the money in 3 years? If the market is down at that time, I can push off the home purchase, I'm not falling over myself to buy as soon as possible. I want it to make financial sense.

Thanks for your help!",finance,1448228864

personalfinance,Trying to estimate my 2015 taxes and I'm coming out owing 9K. Is my math wrong? [CA],"Hi Reddit.

Usually this time of year I take a look at the tax withheld to see if I should withhold 0 going into Christmas to make sure I'm not giving the government an interest free loan, and to boost my shopping power.

I did a quick look at my taxes and it looks like I owe 9K, which is quite a lot.  Did this by plugging in numbers in TurboTax's tax estimator and I've got another spreadsheet I tried out.  In years past I've withheld single-0/1 and gotten a refund, so this is a bit of a shock.  Is my math wrong?

The details:

* Married this year and my wife and I have been withholding married-2 all year long

* combined income of $174K

* Fed Withholding of $22K

* CA Withholding of $7K

* $7.5K of ""capital gains"" from us buying company options, we're still pre-IPO.

* Student Loan Interest of $8K between the two of us

* Mortgage Interest of $10K

* Property Taxes of $4K

* Charitable Contributions of $1K

* DMV fees around $200

I left a message with my EA but given that it's Thanksgiving week I'm not sure I'll get a quick response.  Thanks for any other advice.

personalfinance,Autos not what I thought......,"I received some helpful advice a few days ago concerning whether or not it was feasible for me to pursue an auto loan for a car. So I went out to visit two dealerships today, one I was very unhappy with, the other I was not.

[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3shwcw/20_i_want_to_finance_a_car_why_and_why_not/)

So the first dealership I went to was somewhat dismissing of me. I'm an African American male, and I have a very youthful face. I look 17-18, I'm 20. They didn't seem to want to assist me until after my paystubs and my interest in the VW graduate program. Guy there told me I wouldn't be looking at any real competitive interest rates because of my young age, thin-credit history, and high risk as a 20-year old even with proof of solid income. Secondly, the car I wanted, a CPO GTI was not really an option because the graduate program didn't apply, and I would be looking at a much higher interest rate. They showed me a 2016, and marked the price at $24,800 at 66 mo. and said that would put me at $375/mo.

A little math tells me that I'd be at ~7% interest rate. Which is much higher than the 1.99% I was going for. I understand, I have a very thin credit history going on 4 years now with a couple of cards. all in all this dealership was not very friendly or helpful.


Discouraged, I went to a second dealership. After a huge miscommunication(guy thought I was coming in for $0/down) we sorted things out, and they were able to offer me the same exact car for $25,680 out the door with $7,000 down, 60 mo. at a 3.9% interest rate and monthly payment of $370.52.

My issues:
My budget was originally around 20-22k, and I didn't want to take out more than 15k on a loan. I originally wanted a CPO for the low price, but it appears that used cars come with higher interest rates, and my credit is good, but too thin to entertain interest rates on a CPO car. So my only option is a new car, where 2015s are hard to come by and the dealership is left with offering me a 2016 which comes with a 27k MSRP. 

All in all this is looking to be quite expensive, although I can afford it on a 4k+ monthly income with my limited expenses, I'm not sure it's entirely worth it. If anything I'm 50-50 on the second deal barring the idea that this is the only car I'd want. Any other car I'd put money into will probably be a temporary point A to B vehicle.

Bitcoin,The Future of Cryptocurrency and Why I want to be Involved,"Today, there are over 500 types of cryptocurrencies. My favorite three are Bit Coin, Lite Coin, and Doge coin. I’ve been able to learn a lot about these crypto currencies the past few days and I’m impressed by their potential impact. I’m all about the idea of the decentralization of currency and the worldwide potential impact cryptocurrency offers. However, there are several facets that turn me off.



Digital currencies are the future. Offered in 2008, Bit Coin is a young and growing technology. The benefits of Bit Coin have the power to disrupt the way currency is currently made and used. Fed up after the 2008 financial crisis, the idea of a decentralized currency came to fruition. Bit Coin offered tremendous freedom from third party financial institutions that drive up costs and cause problems. 



There is no third party seizure; meaning government can’t freeze your account. Bit Coin is used anonymously, with no taxes or transaction costs. While many people are concerned about the limitless power of governments over an individual’s life, Bit Coin and other cryptocurrencies offer an awesome solution of freedom. The question here is why isn’t everyone already using this technology?



While my understanding of cryptocurrencies is limited, I believe I have valid concerns. The earning power of Bit Coin is not a concern. I think that as digital currencies become more popular, the price will continue to appreciate.  My main concern about Bit Coin is HOW you get it.



 These Bit Coin Farms use ridiculous amount of electricity and I could never have a similar mining operation. The way Bit Coin is mined, in my opinion, has a negative economic and environmental impact. While Lite Coin offers an alternative mining process that alleviates these concerns, it is still the “silver” to the Bit Coin’s “gold”. However, I think both are still great investment vehicles and everyone should buy some now. 



If anyone has any further reading for me I would greatly appreciate it. I’m extremely interested and am trying to consume everything! The financial impacts and how cryptocurrency is used as an investment vehicle interests me most. Do you currently hold cryptocurrency? What do you expect the future to be for digital currency?

Bitcoin,Monetary Policy with Bitcoin,"Hi /R/Bitcoin! Quick question, I'm taking a macroeconomics course right now, and while we were reviewing monetary policy (where the Central Bank can buy/sell bonds/securities or change federal funds rate etc. in a bid to affect the money supply) I was thinking that if Bitcoin became widely adopted (and by widely, I mean the dominant currency) wouldn't countries loose the ability to utilize monetary policy to guide their own economies?

 Even more, if the several countries all used Bitcoin, wouldn't that force them them to suffer economic consequences from weaker nations. (This last point seems like something we're seeing in the Eurozone right now, so I guess we'll get a chance to see how it plays out....)

I really like Bitcoin and its privacy protections and how you can easily verify transactions, etc. but I was wondering if the inability of governments to utilize monetary policy within their own country is a negative that the community acknowledges. Or perhaps my measly grasp of economics has failed to understand how countries could still conduct monetary policy? Because as far as I can tell, monetary policy is pretty important....

Google just released its Mortgage Comparison tool and I figured I'd type in my info. It gave me results with mortgage rates of 3.375% (APR of 3.563%). This shows me a monthly rate of a little over $900.

personalfinance,A little desperate for help. I think someone is trying to steal my identity.,"I need help. I'm just going to type out a list of recent events.

About two or three weeks ago, I tried to use my debit card. It was declined. Called my bank. The card was placed on hold. I had to verify some charges. Verified them. Turned out, I needed to change my address so charges in my ""new"" town wouldn't be deemed suspicious. I've lived in this town for a year and a half, but that's neither here nor there. Card works.

A day later, card was placed on hold again. Same situation. Verified some charges, card taken off of hold. 

Two or three days later, the same thing happens. I get fed up and ask for a brand new debit card because this was all getting a bit ridiculous. 

Card finally comes in the mail. They sent me the exact same card. Same number, same expiration. The card works fine so I just decide I'm going to get over it and continue using it. 

That same day, I go to use my debit card and there is a hold again! Call my bank. Same song and dance. We need you to verify some charges. Okay, fine. The charges are listed and, lo and behold, I have over $200 in charges I did not make. Shit. Immediately cancel my card. Get a brand new card and some instructions on how to get this money back. 

Over this past weekend, the password for my gmail account and my apple account have been changed. I did not change these passwords. 

Just a couple more things to note: 
- some of the fraudulent charges were $1 to Apple
-I've been using Venmo for two or three months to pay rent and bills with my roommates
-I deleted that Venmo account today 
-I recently (as in three days ago) finally got an actual credit card because I am desperately trying to repair my credit score over the next year 

I'm a little paranoid about everything and want to take any preventative measures I can. I've already contacted my dad, who also happens to be my lawyer, but sometimes these situations are difficult for him just because he doesn't understand technology incredibly well.

personalfinance,100k in Student Loans. Feeling Trapped. Need Advice.,"I'll start with my Loan Breakdown.

Stafford Loans w/ Great Lakes:

 Federal |  Loan 1 |  Loan 2  |  Loan 3 |  Loan 4  |  Loan 5 | Loan 6
------|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|----
Principle  |  $2,750 |  $7,500  | $1,250  |  $6,500 |  $7,500 | $5,500
Interest Rate |  6.8%  |  6.8%  |  4.66% |  6.8% |  3.86% | 6.8%
Term | 10 yr | 10 yr | 10 yr | 10 yr | 10 yr | 10 yr

For some reason they have Loans 1-5 grouped together and Loan 6 separately. After looking at them over and over I can't find anything different between them.

Loan 1-5 Total: $25,500 (Monthly Payment: $338.11)

Loan 6: $5,500 (Monthly Payment: $89.54)

Total: $31,100 (Total Monthly Payment: $427.65)


Private Loans w/ Sallie Mae &amp; Navient:

Private  |  Sallie Mae  |  Navient 1  |  Navient 2  |  Navient 3   | Navient 4  | Navient 5 | Navient 6 
--------|------------|------|------|------|-----|----|----
Current Balance  |  $11,253.88  |  $16,548.04  |  $17,584.35 |  $16,034.49  |  $8.798.68 | $5,636.88 | $5,352.70
Interest Rate |  7.00%  |  6.5%  |  7.5%  |  7% |  9.75% | 11.5% | 10.62%
Term  |  12 yr  |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A  |  N/A | N/A | N/A
Monthly Payment |  $90.97  |  $163 |  $160.66  |  $140.01  |  $90.29 | $58.02 | $47.87

I cannot find on Navient's website where my term is. I'm going to figure this out when I call them. Additionally, it has them grouped into two different categories. Loans 1-3 and 2-6 are grouped together. I assume this has to to do with the type of loan/interest rate as I know my dad paid on these a little while in school.

Private Loan Monthly Payment: $750.82

Total Private Balance: $69,955

This brings my total monthly student loan payment to $1178.47.

I got a degree in Computer Science. I was never passionate about the subject and was a very mediocre student. While in school I worked for the University part time in the IT department. After graduating I knew I didn't want to be a software developer and was able to get a full time job working in the IT department for the Medical School. I really like my current job and know there is room to move up. I've already had this conversation with my boss. I'm doing very very well and am in line to move up, but I'm just a few months out of college and need the experience under my belt first. I am already working on raising my income. I currently make $36,500. I get two paychecks a month at $1056 each. 


I live at home. My parents aren't charging me for rent or food. They pay my car insurance and cell phone bill, and they are okay with this setup. I've talked to them about it and they do not mind helping me out. Occasionally I will eat at work, but have been trying to cook to save money. 
I do need to have some dental work done and will have to pay for that. I will have to have a molar implant put in. I'm not sure how much is going to be covered by my insurance, but I assume this will be expensive. I'm working with the Dentists office to get a quote on this before moving forward.

I currently have about $3300 saved up from my first couple months at the job.

So I'm just not sure how to move forward. I have taken zero action on my student loans and am just now getting out of my grace periods. My first payment on my Federal Loans are due on 12/28 and my first payment on my private loans are due 12/13. What the hell do I do here. I'm so confused. It all seems like so much. They are taking half of my monthly income. 

I understand this will be hard. I know its going to suck. But I need to tackle this the right way. I've always been bad with tracking my finances and this will be where I turn that around. But I have some questions and don't know where to go for answers.

1. I understand that the best way to tackle this would be to pay the minimum on all my loans except for my highest interest rate loan. Throw everything at that. Is this correct? 

2. On the payment screen for Navient, it has my loans grouped. I don't understand how to direct the payments to the single highest interest rate loan. (Granted, it has the 9.75% and up grouped, and the 7.5% and lower grouped, so thats nice)

3. I work for a major state university. Does this qualify me for any form of loan forgiveness on my federal loans? I've seen I need to make 100 payments, but that seems like damn near the entire thing. Can I lower these somehow? Do they forgive everyone or do I have to meet other criteria? Can I be denied even after qualifying?

4. I'm nervous about my savings. Especially with this tooth thing I have going on. I feel like I should have at least $5k in my bank to fall back on in case of car trouble/health issues/etc. How do I lower my loan payments so that I can actually save a little bit?

5. Is it worth it to only pay the interest on some of these loans for a couple years? Using the leftover money towards savings and then at specific loans?

6. I've read in other threads about extending the terms of your loan to lower the payments. I don't see that option anywhere. Am I going to have to call and work this out over the phone? How do I know if this will help me? And if it does, is that something worth doing? To free up my money to put elsewhere?

7. What about restructuring to lower interest rates? My dad seems convinced I should combine them all into one loan somehow, but this seems wrong.

8. What other steps should I be taking? I want some advice before I call these companies and talk to them.

So this wednesday is the day we are finally getting super serious about paying down our debt (not that we wern't super serious before just more that we both got new jobs and have a lot more money to use to pay it off). 

When we got married we racked up a lot of debt for the wedding (I know we were stupid) and have been trying to unbury ourselves ever since. 

I put together a budget that will allow us to throw about 3-4k/month at debt and, not including bonuses, will get us completely out of credit debt in 10-13 months.

What I'm really trying to figure out is the best order to pay things off. 

Like I said we have a LOT of debt (we were stupid) but have the means to pay it down now. 

I'm trying to figure out if it's advantageous to pay off the smaller balances that have a high monthly payments (example, my wife's car will be paid off in April. It has a balance of 1200 on it and has a monthly cost of $285) or to pay off the higher interest higher balance items that have a lower monthly minimum (ex my credit card has a 4k balance and costs 100/month but at a 18% interest rate). 

The goal is to go as quickly as possible so I'm not sure if snowballing it (paying off the small items with a high minimum payment so that that amount can be applied to a bigger debt) or avalanching it (Paying the biggest or highest interest debt first to prevent the accrual of interest) would be better. 

I get a signing bonus on Wednesday and I'll have about 10k to work with up front. 20% is going straight to savings to give us a cushion but the rest will go straight to our debt.

personalfinance,Building Credit,"Hello PF,

  
TLDR: I have a $1000 Secured Discover IT Card and a vanilla $500 Capital One. I applied for a few credit cards when I first moved and got denied a few times. I am scared to apply for anything else as it damages your credit score.

  
Last year I moved to the USA. One thing i did not understand was credit scoring. I have read up on it since then and understand it better. I just need a little advice on what to do.


This is what I had done:  
1. After moving and getting a job I applied for a AMEX card through COSTCO when i signed up. (Denied)  
2. I few months later I applied for a Discover IT card. My friend said they were pretty good with new people wanting to build credit. (Denied)  
3. After about 6-8 months of my full time employment I collected the paystubs and headed to my local bank. I had an account with them and a few grand in the bank. (Denied)  
4. After much frustration Discover sent me an offer for an Secured Card. So I put $1000 deposit and got a Discover It card with the $1000 limit. I try to run all my expenses through this as they have cashback bonuses. 
5. After about 2 months I received a pre approved card with Capital One ($500 credit line, High interest rates (24%) and $0 annual fee. I applied and got it. (I use this at places that don't accept discover)  
6. A few months later my bank had an offer for 5k loan at 4% interest rate. I already had a loan with my friend and applied for this to pay him off. (Denied)   

  
So right now I run mostly everything through my Secured Discover IT card (Around 2k per month). my problem is its only a $1000 limit and I usually have to pay this 2-3 times per month. I called up discover and they said the usual wait time is 1 year before I can upgrade to a Regular credit card and there was nothing i could do.  

  
I always pay my balances in full and never missed a payment. I am scared to apply for any more credit cards as I know it damages my score. I know my main problem is my credit history is new (about 8 months with my discover card)  

  
Q1: How long should i wait before applying for another credit card?   
Q2: Should i keep running everything through my discover it card or start using the Capital One more often?  
Q3: Also should I request my credit score from AnnualCreditReport? Discover offer a free FICO score but it just says I am to new to have a score.  

  
Current credit cards  
Discover IT: Secured $1000 Limit, I usually put 2k+ through this a month.  
Capital One: $500 limit, about $100 a month.  

  
My Credit history guess:
Missed payments 0. 
Oldest credit line 8 months. 
Inquires 4. 
Accounts 2. 
Available credit $1500.

If I transferred it to my personal account or invested it, would that get attention from the IRS?

My state of residence is on the East Coast, but my company has me in Oklahoma for 2 years working on a project.

Other info: I will not itemize otherwise, as my standard deduction will be higher. 

Thank you in advance. 

Edit: found my answer. It depends whether your substantiation is ""accountable"" or ""nonaccountable.""

 If it is accountable, then it will not count as wages on your W2. This means it's basically free money and your employer takes the tax write off. 

If it is nonaccountable, it is considered income and goes on your W2 as wages. It is tax deductible to you.",finance,1448394097
personalfinance,RE-Posted due to lack of response. I am desperate for advice on loan/debt consolidation,"Hello all,

I graduated in May 2015 with a BA in Political Science and am currently applying for law schools for the Fall of 2016 (yes, I am sure I want to go and am aware of the financial risks). I have a kind of unique situation and was hoping to get some feedback about debt consolidation.

I was in an Army ROTC program on a partial scholarship at school. Unfortunately, due to a reoccurring back injury my senior year, I was unable to complete my commission and was given a general dis-enrollment.
While in the program (and unaware of my injury) I took out the USAA Cadet Career Starter Loan for $10,000 at a 2.99% APR in order to purchase a car (great cond. 2005 Toyota Prius, first and only car I've ever had). Not commissioning caused three things.

*Since I was unable to pass an physical fitness tests, I lost my scholarship mid-semester and ended up taking out (regrettably) a $5,500 education loan from Wells Fargo (my current bank) at a 12.75% interest rate, to pay for my final semester.

*The Army now wants my partial scholarship back ($12,000). They wrote me last week with my official dis-enrollment paperwork and will be sending me a repayment schedule shortly, I have no clue on the possible interest rate.

*Not commissioning, as per the USAA Loan agreement, is considered defaulting and will raise the rate to 18% (making the $185 min payment a $305 one). NOTE: I only was only officially dis-enrolled last Friday, so I haven't notified USAA yet, but will)

I also have the usual combo of unsub and sub'd government loans for $20,000 that are still in their grace period. I did an internship (unpaid) over the summer, but then got a job as a receptionist at a law firm for $15/hr bi-weekly last month. My rent is cheap (numerous roommates so its less $300/m) and my other expenses (phone, gas, insurance, groceries, gym, credit card bills) are little less than a $1000 on average. I really would like advice on how to move forward.

I'm worried about the new interest rate on my USAA loan and was curious about debt consolidation options. I got a couple of quotes from prosper.com and lending club. The best was LC for a $10,000 loan at 16.21% APR &amp; 12.75% interest over 36 months ($353.00/mon).

I have about 35k in student loans with interest rates between 3.5%-6.5%. Average rate is about 5%.
My wife also has nearly identical student loans so total loans are around 70k.



Financial situation:

I'm making 54k a year and she's making about 33k as a teacher before taxes.
Our overall financial situation is pretty good I think. We have a 120K house we bought a few years ago and a 3 year old. 13k in checking, 13k as an emergency fund. One car is almost paid up and the other is a company car. I have a good career path and expect my income to steadily rise to about 100,000k in 5 years if I end up taking over my boss's business as he's planning.


I'm seriously considering using a home equity loan to pay off either one of or both of our student loans to take advantage of the lower interest rate while continuing with the same payment schedule. Here's what I know so far:

1) I could lose my house if I fail to pay the loans.

2) There may be a fee associated with the equity loan.

3) The interest would be quite a bit lower.

4) I could still claim the accrued interest on my taxes (not sure if there are any conditions that have to be met for this to work)

5) I lose access to income based repayment but I wouldn't use that anyways.

Questions:


1) Are there any other disadvantages I'm not aware of? Any negative tax consequences? 

2) My wife mentioned some kind of loan forgiveness for teachers but I think that just forgives any unpaid loans after 10 years of payments while working as a teacher. Not sure how likely she would be to qualify for loan forgiveness but maybe I should only pay off my loans and leave hers alone?

3)Anything else that I should know before making a decision on this?

worldpolitics,Trans-Pacific Partnership - Down With U.S. Imperialism’s Anti-China Trade Pact!,"No to Protectionism! Workers of the World Unite!

On October 5, representatives of 12 countries from across Asia and the Americas signed on to U.S. imperialism’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). If it is ratified, the TPP will be the largest trade agreement in history, encompassing at least 40 percent of the world’s gross domestic product and one-third of all global trade. Japan and the more minor imperialist countries Canada and Australia have been cut in on the deal—and competing European powers cut out—but it is the U.S. rulers who hold the whip hand. Under the banner of “free trade,” the TPP aims to drive up the exploitation of labor across the board while increasing imperialist domination of dependent countries. Above all, this agreement targets China, escalating the U.S. bourgeoisie’s drive to promote capitalist counterrevolution there through economic pressure and military encirclement.

The TPP has been described as “NAFTA on steroids,” after the 1994 agreement that opened the door for the wholesale economic rape of Mexico by America’s capitalist rulers and their Canadian junior partners. The TPP agreement would batter down measures protecting industry and agriculture in underdeveloped countries, eliminating 18,000 taxes and other controls on U.S. companies’ goods and services. Secret tribunals, empowered to overturn the decisions of national courts, would be established to allow investors to sue any signatory country they claim undermines their “expected profits.” The bloodsuckers of America’s Big Pharma drug monopolies would have their patent rights extended, ripping generic drugs out of the hands of millions of impoverished people whose lives depend on them, including for the treatment of HIV and tuberculosis.

The bourgeois rulers of Brunei, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and other backward countries, lackeys of U.S. imperialism, signed the TPP in a bid to get their own shares of the wealth wrung from greater misery. The ruling Communist Party bureaucracy in the Vietnamese deformed workers state also agreed to the TPP’s extortionate terms, acting as labor brokers in exchange for foreign investment. At the same time, the provisions of the TPP that directly target state-owned enterprises are centrally aimed at Vietnam.

The collectivized property forms central to Vietnam’s economy are a gain of the social revolution that overturned capitalism, when Communist-led guerrilla forces defeated first the French and then the U.S. imperialists and their Vietnamese puppet forces. By demanding “fair competition” for capitalist investment, the TPP aims to undermine the workers state’s control of the economy.

China in the Crosshairs

The largest remaining country where capitalism has been overthrown, the Chinese deformed workers state is a strategic target of the imperialists. Washington pointedly excluded China from the agreement in an attempt to form an economic bloc against that country and undercut its growing economic reach. The TPP is the economic analog to the U.S.’s increasingly flagrant military provocations against China. Last spring, U.S. defense secretary Ashton Carter declared: “Passing TPP is as important to me as another aircraft carrier.”

In the first week of November, a U.S. aircraft carrier conducted operations near Chinese land reclamation and construction projects in the South China Sea’s Spratly (Nansha) Islands. These islands are of strategic importance to China’s military defense and its ability to protect critical shipping lanes. Threatening China’s sovereignty, Carter announced that the U.S. would make regular patrols of the area. Behind such gunboat diplomacy lies the threat of embargo and war.

To the ire of the U.S., there has been a stampede of countries, including European imperialist powers, to get in on the ground floor of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that China initiated last October. Although it has yet to begin operations, the AIIB will challenge the loan sharks who run imperialist-dominated lending institutions. While outfits like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank dictate how countries they invest in should be governed and starve out those who don’t obey, the AIIB will reportedly offer loans for much-needed infrastructure development at below-market interest rates with no strings attached. While the ruling Chinese bureaucracy is not motivated by international solidarity, neither are its international investments driven by the relentless pursuit of profit that motivates the imperialist plunder of less-developed countries.

To counter U.S. imperialism’s efforts at containment, China is also developing a “new Silk Road.” Including multiple trading networks linking Asia and Western Europe, new Silk Road development includes pipelines, rail, air and sea routes as well as high-tech communications systems. These developments loomed large in the Obama administration’s decision to fast-track TPP negotiations. Focusing on Asia in this year’s State of the Union address, Obama argued: “As we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest growing region.... We should write those rules.”

The president’s push for fast-track authority suffered a brief setback in June when Democratic Party members of Congress voted it down, looking to boost their electoral fortunes with the trade-union bureaucracy. There was much rejoicing at AFL-CIO headquarters. The federation’s president Richard Trumka crowed that the vote “was a marvelous contrast to the corporate money and disillusionment that normally mark American politics today.” But this elation went up in smoke a few weeks later when the fast-track was voted up.

There is a burning need for internationalist proletarian opposition to the TPP, uniting the working masses around the globe in common class struggle. If the U.S. rulers succeed in the counterrevolutionary destruction of the Chinese workers state, it would mean opening China for untrammeled economic exploitation. This would be a disaster for the working class internationally, emboldening the imperialists to launch new attacks and drive down wages and working conditions not only in China, but around the world.

Raising a chauvinist hue and cry that the TPP will cost “American” jobs, the AFL-CIO bureaucrats oppose the pact because it doesn’t go far enough in creating a “strategic advantage over China” for U.S. capitalists. Against the China-bashing protectionism of the labor misleaders, which pits U.S. workers against their class brothers and sisters internationally, our opposition to the TPP is based on opposition to our “own” imperialist rulers and our unconditional defense of the Chinese deformed workers state.

U.S. Imperialism’s Loyal Labor Lieutenants

The AFL-CIO’s treatise, “The U.S.-China Economic Relationship: The TPP is Not the Answer,” blames China for “undercutting U.S. manufacturers and displacing millions of U.S. jobs” (aflcio.org, undated). In reality, the decline in U.S. manufacturing and the massacre of jobs, wages and social benefits are in the purest sense “made in the U.S.A.” By tying the interests of workers to the profitability of their exploiters, the capitalist class’s labor lieutenants in the trade-union bureaucracy paved the way for these defeats. Rather than mobilizing labor’s power in a fight against the decades-long onslaught against the unions, the labor misleaders argue that the workers must “sacrifice” in order to increase the competitive edge of U.S. capitalism against its rivals. One need look no further than the ravaged remains of the United Auto Workers (UAW), once the symbol of union power in this country, for the results of the bureaucrats’ class collaboration.

Following World War II, the U.S. emerged as the dominant imperialist power in the world, its boasts of technological and productive superiority epitomized by the auto industry. By the 1960s, however, U.S. dominance was increasingly challenged by the rising economic might of West Germany and Japan. The industrial base in those countries, which had been destroyed in World War II, was replaced by new plants that were far more advanced. Faced with growing competition, the U.S. auto bosses responded with a concerted campaign to intensify the exploitation of labor through massive layoffs and giveback contracts. Beginning in the 1980s, production was increasingly moved from the unionized North and Midwest to the open shop South, as well as to Latin America and East Asia.

Obliging the bosses’ demands for concessions in the name of “saving jobs,” the UAW bureaucrats launched a chauvinist crusade to defend the Big Three against competing manufacturers. The racism at the heart of the UAW’s “buy American” protectionism was demonstrated in the murder of a young Chinese American, Vincent Chin, who was bludgeoned to death in 1982 by a Chrysler foreman who thought he was Japanese and blamed him for “stealing American jobs.” Meanwhile, non-union auto plants expanded as Japanese, German and South Korean manufacturers set up shop in the low-wage, open shop U.S. South in order to get around protectionist import restrictions.

In response, the UAW leadership has agreed to more and more concessions. While decrying “cheap labor” abroad, they helped create a pool of cheap labor in the union itself with the introduction of two-tier wages. Today, the UAW tops propose to fight the domestic “outsourcing” of union jobs to non-union auto supply plants with a program of “insourcing.” To entice auto parts suppliers in the U.S. back under the Big Three umbrella, the bureaucrats are offering third-tier wages! Thus in the name of “defending union jobs” in the U.S., the trade-union misleaders operate as cutthroat labor contractors for the bosses.

This long string of betrayals is hardly peculiar to the UAW. The same processes have reduced the industrial unions in this country to a shadow of their former selves. The pro-capitalist labor bureaucracy looks for friends in the camp of the capitalist class enemy and sees enemies and competitors in the growing ranks of the proletariat in Latin America and Asia. In fact, workers in other countries are crucial allies in the fight against capitalist exploitation. If the unions are to be effective instruments of struggle against the bosses, they must break the chains forged by the labor traitors that have shackled the workers to their exploiters. That means ousting the red-white-and-blue bureaucrats and replacing them with a class-struggle leadership whose banner will be the red flag of proletarian internationalism. The struggle for such a leadership must be tied to forging the multiracial revolutionary workers party that can lead the proletariat to victory in the “final conflict” to end the predatory rule of U.S. imperialism at home and abroad.

Defend the Gains of the Chinese Revolution!

The anti-Communist AFL-CIO misleaders have a long track record of dirty work on behalf of the U.S. rulers. At the outset of the Cold War, the predecessors of today’s labor sellouts purged the militants who led the CIO organizing battles. The AFL-CIO tops lent their services to the destruction of militant unions in Europe and Latin America, where they became known as the “AFL-CIA.” In the 1980s, the union bureaucracy channeled millions of CIA dollars to Polish Solidarność, a reactionary movement masquerading as a trade union that spearheaded the drive for capitalist restoration in East Europe. Cut of the same cloth is the AFL-CIO’s call for “free trade unions” in Vietnam, which, not surprisingly, is incorporated into the TPP.

Similarly, the labor misleaders echo their imperialist masters’ complaints that the Chinese government subsidizes state-owned industries, controls its currency, limits competition from foreign imports and offers other countries beneficial trade and investment. Yet the things they decry as “unfair” reflect gains for the working class that were won through the 1949 Chinese Revolution which drove out the imperialists and overthrew capitalism.

The core of the Chinese economy is collectivized, not privately owned by individual capitalist exploiters. State-owned enterprises dominate strategic industrial sectors, with much of the surplus they create channeled into the banks and treasury of the workers state. State control over China’s currency, the yuan, has insulated the country from the volatile movements of money capital that have wreaked havoc around the world.

Testifying to the superiority of a collectivized economy over production for profit, China’s economy continued to grow while the capitalist world was plunged into economic meltdown following the 2007‑08 collapse of Wall Street’s financial speculation. In the U.S., nine million jobs were destroyed, four million houses foreclosed on and pension funds were looted. Trillions of dollars went to bail out the banks, insurance companies and auto bosses. In contrast, China channeled massive investment into developing infrastructure and productive capacity.

The Chinese Revolution was a tremendous victory for the workers of the world. However, the workers state was deformed from birth by the rule of a nationalist bureaucracy modeled on the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union. Like their Kremlin counterparts before them, the rulers in Beijing oppose the perspective of international proletarian revolution. Thus they promoted the pipe dream of building “socialism in one country” and the equally delusional notion of “peaceful co-existence” with the imperialist powers. Although the Chinese Stalinist bureaucracy’s rule depends on the existence of the workers state it seeks to prosper and maintain its status through an accommodation to the imperialist order, much like the AFL-CIO bureaucracy in this country.

In The Revolution Betrayed (1936), his analysis of the degeneration of the 1917 Russian Revolution, Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky observed of the bureaucracy in Soviet Russia:

“To the extent that, in contrast to a decaying capitalism, it develops the productive forces, it is preparing the economic basis of socialism. To the extent that, for the benefit of an upper stratum, it carries to more and more extreme expression bourgeois norms of distribution, it is preparing a capitalist restoration.”

Since the 1949 Revolution, China has gone from being a backward peasant country to a mostly urban one, lifting some 600 million people out of poverty and creating a powerful industrial proletariat. Nonetheless, China remains a country of extreme contradictions, with great backwardness and poverty, particularly in the countryside. In mainland China today, there is a nascent capitalist class which, along with the corruption that permeates the Communist Party regime, poses a threat of internal capitalist counterrevolution. On the other side, hundreds of millions of workers as well as poor peasants wage countless strikes, protests and riots, estimated at 500 every day, against the consequences of bureaucratic misrule.

This ferment points to the potential for a proletarian political revolution that will sweep away the Stalinist regime and replace it with the rule of workers and peasants councils (soviets). Such a government would put an end to bureaucratic corruption and arbitrariness, creating a centrally planned and managed economy under conditions of workers democracy. It would expropriate the new class of domestic capitalists and seek to renegotiate the terms of foreign investment in the interests of the working people. The elementary Marxist understanding is that the key prerequisite for a socialist society is the elimination of scarcity, requiring the development and expansion of industrial production and technology worldwide. Thus, a genuine communist leadership in China would fight to advance the cause of workers revolution internationally, particularly in advanced capitalist countries like the U.S. and Japan.

Workers of the World Unite!

Since the counterrevolutionary destruction of the Soviet Union in 1991-92, the U.S. imperialists have been riding high in the saddle as the “world’s only superpower.” Promoting the TPP, Defense Secretary Carter boasted: “I never forget that our military strength ultimately rests on the foundation of a vibrant, unmatched and growing economy.” But there’s the rub. The unrivaled military might of U.S. imperialism rests on a corroding manufacturing and industrial base. Instead of investing in expanding and modernizing industry or repairing the country’s crumbling infrastructure, in recent decades the ruling class has enriched itself through a succession of speculative investment binges.

In the early 2000s, to send a message to the world that America remained the top dog of the planet militarily, the U.S. imperialists toppled governments in Afghanistan and Iraq, creating a seething caldron of unrest in the region. In 2010, Hillary Clinton, then Obama’s secretary of state, announced a “pivot to Asia,” which would redirect U.S. forces from the Near East and Afghanistan toward the more strategic aim of destroying the Chinese deformed workers state.

Although the U.S. remains bogged down in a quagmire of its own creation in the Near East, the Obama administration has made a full-court press to get the TPP signed, sealed and delivered. Just as the workers must defend their unions against the bosses despite the bureaucratic traitors that have so undermined them, so too must they fight for the defense of the Chinese deformed workers state despite the treachery of its Stalinist rulers who likewise accommodate the imperialists.

The decades-long war against labor, the shredding of the social “safety net” for the poor and the aged, the increased immiseration of the black population—these are the domestic products of the drive by America’s rulers to reverse their declining economic weight in the world. By fighting for their own interests against the U.S. imperialist predators, workers in the U.S. also strike a blow for the liberation of the oppressed around the planet. The purpose of the International Communist League is to reforge Trotsky’s Fourth International, the world party of socialist revolution, that will bring to the fore the principle of international working-class unity in the struggle for a socialist world. As the ICL’s “Declaration of Principles and Some Elements of Program” explains:

“The victory of the proletariat on a world scale would place unimagined material abundance at the service of human needs, lay the basis for the elimination of classes and the eradication of social inequality based on sex and the very abolition of the social significance of race, nation and ethnicity. For the first time mankind will grasp the reins of history and control its own creation, society, resulting in an undreamed-of emancipation of human potential, and a monumental forward surge of civilization.”

personalfinance,Income Tax Penalties,"My husband and I have underpaid our taxes this year (2015) and are trying to assess how much this mistake is going to cost us... (please forgive the formatting, I'm new to reddit)

 
The Numbers: 

We owed $20,000 in taxes for 2013 - we paid $17,000 via withholdings and the balance of $3,000 when we filed our return.  In 2014, we owed $37,000 and paid $28,000 via witholdings and a check of $9,000.  

For 2015, we don't our liability, but we can expect it to be higher because my husband's S-Corp has made more than any previous year so lets just say we owe $50,000 for the math's sake - so we need to pay at least $37,000 to avoid penalties.  We estimate that our withholdings will total $25,000 at the end of the year. (This is lower than 2014 because I didn't work part of the year and thus wasn't paying taxes like I have in the past)


I THINK the interest rate is 3% and there is an additional penalty of 0.5% for the failure to pay... Is this correct? 

Do we pay this on the $12,000 difference to get us to last year's total (meaning we'd owe ~$420)? Or do we pay it on the total shortfall of $25,000 owed (meaning we'd owe ~$875)? 


__________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Backstory for anyone who cares: 

My husband owns a tiny % of a S-Corp and for the first time this year, they sent us quarterly tax distributions instead of an annual estimate at the end of the year, but didn't really explain the reason for the change.  

Now, the RIGHT thing to do would have been to immediately turn around and mail those payments to the IRS as quarterly installments... but I didn't know that back in June when we got the first one (already late, but less-so than it is now!), so I stuck it in our savings account thinking I should just save it until the year was over and pay however much extra we owed when I filed our tax returns (like I've done in years past)... In September we received the 2nd Quarter installment which was substantially larger than the 1st which made me a little nervous thinking about the fact that the government probably wants their money sooner rather than later, and that's when I discovered we should have been sending it in quarterly; but I wasn't exactly sure how to do it, so again, I put it in savings thinking ""I'll figure this out later"" (being pregnant, there's a lot of things waiting on ""later"" these days)... we have no idea what Q3 is or what Q4 will be since we aren't ""in the loop"" on this part of the company except receiving the checks so I don't even know when to expect them since the 1st two were so late.    

Now, I knew that as long as we paid at least as much in taxes as our total due LAST year, that we wouldn't have a penalty, so I considered sending in an additional installment payment to at least bring us up to that number, but I figured I would consult a CPA first and likely have them take over our taxes since this is a bit over my head (I've been doing our taxes with turbo tax since we got married, but it's gotten a lot more complicated since we moved states and he's now got this ownership).  So, I contacted a CPA who recommended that instead of mailing in the payment late, we should ask my husband's company to simply take an extra withholding from his year-end bonus in order to bring us up to at least the amount we paid last year in taxes in order to avoid penalties.  After the meeting with the CPA I was shocked to receive a bill for over $100 for this small bit of advice (since I was under the impression it was just a ""getting to know you"" type meeting to see IF we wanted to hire her to do our taxes), so I will NOT be going back; but that's a whole separate can of worms, but is the reason I'm not asking her these questions.    

The problem is, we don't know how much that bonus would be and we're several thousand dollars ""short"" in our previous year's tax payments via withholdings-alone and there's really no good way to ask the majority owners how much his bonus will be (to even know if it's enough to COVER our tax shortage) and my husband REALLY doesn't want to have that conversation for a variety of reasons.  Namely because it's pretty presumptuous to assume his bonus might even be large enough to cover the additional $12k needed to avoid the penalty all together.  

Basically, we're trying to figure out how much this mistake is going to cost us... if it's a small/moderate amount of money then it's worth paying the penalty and not looking like an idiot to his boss, but if it's a large amount of money, he'll suck it up and admit our mistake and ask them to help us mitigate and/or correct it via the extra withholding.  My husband knows exactly nothing about anything to do with finance (seriously, couldn't even tell you who our utilities and mortgage company are, let alone how much the bills are or when to pay them) so he's basically left this to me, and I've unfortunately neglected it this year and now we're paying for that...

Me and my partner have about $440 left each month after paying all bills. I am planning on paying off the unsecured CC debt first. 

I have already used Debt Snowball calculators and will be paying $300/month towards the CC debt starting next year. This will pay off the CC debt in two years using the snowball method. If I kept using the snowball method after paying off the CC debt, I would pay off all of the additional unsecured debt in 6 months. This would equal a total payment time of 2.5 - 3 years for the unsecured debt amount above.

In addition to the debt above, I have a $8,200 personal loan used for a car and about $30,000k in student loans.

I did a budget calculation and with my income of $2,000/month and current expenses I would have about $1,345 left over each month if I decided to default on all of my debt. If I still paid on my student loans, I would have about $1,130 left over each month. My partner also works, and together we clear about $3,000/month after taxes.

personalfinance,28 Years Old 0 savings want to start savings need advice.,"Hi guys i see this subreddit is mainly for people from US. However I am not from US, I am from Pakistan. I have 0 savings I am 28 years old and am paid about 82k pkr monthly (roughly 820USD) this is a lot of money in Pakistan where i can be considered in Upper middle class. I am married and have no kids but we plan on having 2 as soon as possible. Due to a strong family traditions that we have in our country we have our own house and 2 cars so we don't really need to save money for anything big in our life. However all the money that I earn goes into household expenses. 

I have enough money right now but I may not have enough of it once my kids start going to colleges or universities or when they decide to get married. What i want to do is to start saving. Now there are two options available to me right now i can start saving monthly into a fixed interest rate account which historically has about 8-10% profit. Or i can go and invest into blue chip stocks. Paksitani stock market gave a profit of about 667% from 1997 to 2010. This year though it is roughly at 10% because of the crash in Beijing Stock Market.

i would roughly be saving 5k pkr and depositing them into an account which will be managed by my bank not by me. They take a 2.5% services charges for stock fund management. 

I have 0 background into financing etc and can't decide which one is better. I am also afraid that the stock market might crash like the Beijing one and I may lose a lot of my money. However the investment I want to make will be long term and I will be in no hurry to withdraw any money (may be 18 to 20 years long).

Edit 1: Inflation rate in Pakistan is 4~4.5%

Edit 2: From the replies i have seen i have come to see I am at the wrong place. People don't have idea of the cultural norms in Pakistan. Raising up children does not cost that much in Pakistan specially in joint family systems. 

My main concern was should i go with a fixed profit for my long term investments or should I go for investment into stock market as long term? Which a lot of people don't tend to address. 

Edit 3: I am thankful for all the replies and it has brought to my attention that I should start saving but why cant i put my savings into some investment? And if I do what kind of investments should it be fixed rate of return or stock management firm?

Edit 4: Thank you for all the concern and advice. I have decided to go for both of the options.",finance,1448458643

So I sat down and did the math in Excel and my surplus is saying $14,010.91 of unallocated funds. For some reason this seems untrue, but I can't figure out if I'm missing something or if I messed up math somewhere. Can anyone look this over and let me know if there are any gaps or flaws in my thinking?

Here is the breakdown:

Annual Pre-tax Income: $65,000

My federal tax is 25%, so I used this formula to $5,156.25+(.25($65,000-$37,450)) to calculate my federal tax contribution as $12,043.75

I live in PA which has a flat 3.07% income tax, which puts my state tax contribution at $1,995.50

And since I live in Philly I gotta pay an additional 3.92% for the Philly Wage Tax, putting my city contribution to $2,548.

My total Tax Contribution should around $16,587.25, making my Post-Tax Income at $48,412.75.

Quick recap:

**Annual Income: $65,000**

**Federal Tax: $12,043.75**

**State Tax: $1,955.50**

**City Wage Tax: $2,548**

**Post-Tax Income (Actual Earning): $48,412.75**

For the past two years I've been saving up to buy a house which I just accomplished back in July. The house sale price was $199,900 (193,000 mortgage total), interest rate at 4.25%, no PMI, and my monthly mortgage cost is $1,141.84

I have student federal student loans totaling $22,636.13 at interest rates between 3.4%-6.8%, with a minimum payment of $305.72. I put extra money towards the 6.8% interest loan with the highest principle to reduce the amount of total interest I'll incur over the course of my repayment, but the sake of the budget I only put the minimum payment as my expense.

I also financed some furniture from Raymour &amp; Flanigan when I bought my house because they offered a 2 year no interest plan where as long as I don't miss two consecutive payments and pay at least the minimum, they won't charge interest. I wanted to get quality furniture that would last me long-term so I didn't mind splurging a bit and skipping the Ikea route. The total credit debt from that was $3,200 with a minimum payment of $135 a month, but have that down to $2,451.71 and have been paying extra per month to get rid of it sooner than later.

To recap my monthly debt minimum payments:

**Mortgage: $1,141.84 (Property Tax &amp; Home Owners Insurance is included in this**

**Student Loans: $305.72**

**Furniture: $135**

**Total Debt Minimum Payment: $1,582.56**

I previously rented a house with comparable square footage, with way more draft/heating expense (was very old house/mechanics/leakywindows, whereas my new house is completely rehabbed and has new efficient mechanics, plus I weather sealed my windows to reduce heating needs) prior to my home purchase, so I used that for my expected monthly utility costs because I'd rather overbudget for it instead of underbudgeting. 

My monthly bills are as follows:

**Water: $40**

**Electric: $78**

**Gas: $70**

**Internet: $75.78**

**Cell Phone: $112.07 (I want to reduce this, but haven't made appropriate moves on it yet)**

**ADT (Home Alarm System): $48.41**

**Netflix: $10**

**Total Bill Expense: $434.26**

My living costs are as follows per month:

**Food: $300**

**Dining Out: $100**

**Alcohol: $200**

**Weed: $50**

**Transit (subway and ubers for when the weather sucks): $100**

**Dates: $100**

**Total Living Expenses: $850**

These are the main expenses I believe I will have coming to $2,866.82 per month, $34,401.84 per year, leaving me with $14,010.91 leftover from my post-tax income.

Am I missing something here? I know there are household expenses such as cleaning supplies, body care, salt for snow/ice, etc., but I don't use shampoo or soap (long story) and never use paper towels or napkins unless it's for drying surfaces so I rarely have to buy them... I stocked up on a fuckload of toilet paper, so I can't see myself spending more than $500 total for a year's worth of whatever home supplies I may come to need, so I'd still have $13,500+ leftover.

All my appliances and mechanical devices are brand new. I read all the user manuals/proper use guides so I don't anticipate any of them breaking this year or the next few years, although if they do let's say it'd cost me $1,500 to replace (I'm being generous with that figure) would leave me with $11,000 leftover.

I feel like I may be missing something because that seems like a lot of extra money to have laying around.

For anyone who has read this far; thank you for your time... Does my budget methodology check out? Or am I missing something here?

If I'm not missing something and my figures are accurate, what should I do with all this extra cash? I have been contributing to my 401(k) at 15% with employer match at 5% for the past two years, so it's pretty sizable at this point and I recently stopped because I really want to rid myself of my student loans and Raymour &amp; Flanigan debt so I can clear those payments out and begin an IRA with their payments. I've never had a credit card besides the one I used to finance the furniture and don't plan to get one anytime soon either.

Thank you for your time and I really appreciate any response I get! Also, hope everyone has a happy Thanksgiving.

Hi there from a throwaway account! So as the title suggests, I have a bonus coming up and I'm curious to see what the community has to suggest in terms of my fiscal responsibility with this situation. I've done some math based on previous years and I should be taking home about ~$35K of the ~$50K (stock, cash, etc).  


Back story:  
Normally this wouldn't be a post but 2 yrs ago I bought a 3bdrm/2bath fixer-upper house and took it down to the studs with renovations. We had the opportunity to make it our own so we did... Except that this came at a big cost because I spent almost all of my savings into the house, including my credit cards. We ran into issues with the home and it turned out to be an expensive learning curve! Now, the house is nice and nearly done except for the master bathroom which still needs just under $10,000 for it to be finished. I mention this fact because I can't complete an appraisal without a finished bathroom (maybe I could). Anyway, a good appraisal of the house would likely help me get rid of my PMI.

Question:  
I'm wondering which debt(s) to tackle and how much of it to pay off to make the debt more managable and be strategic from a credit perspective. Appease the credit gods short term, lower some payments and still be smart in the long term.  
  

Some thoughts:  

 - Not sure if I should snowball or avalanche here
 - I'm able to pay all bills but we're on a tight budget in the most of the year
 - Keeping liquid reserves for general savings and contingencies would be ideal
 - The $700 credit card payment is a big thorn, and would be great to reduce that at least by $300-400.
 - My PMI isn't making a dent in our monthly expeneses, but would like to see that come off in the next few years

personalfinance,Concerns with Tax-Deferred accounts and Distributions,"As a 23 year old right off of college, I wanted to know what I can do now fiscally to better plan for retirement, future, etc. and /r/personalfinance has been more than amazing in providing information on how to ""make it."" 

Now I know the general consensus in being successful is to max-out IRA, generously fund your 401(k) (or whatever your company offers) and invest if you want more (Mutual Funds seem to be the go-to). However, I still do have my concerns (this might sound very basic and pedestrian). The calculation of wealth that I've been hearing a lot seem to be this: Money + Time +/- Interest (Rate of Return) = Wealth. But in my opinion, shouldn't there be 2 more variables being **TAXES** and **INFLATION** which are both negative in terms of wealth calculation? Because isn't it what we actually take home and receive that matters rather than what it can grow to? 

Whenever I see comments or posts listing numbers and projections of these accounts (i.e. if you invest in good mutual funds with $500/month for 40 years = roughly $1 million) there is one thing that I can't seem to shake off, how much will you really **receive?** 
From that example, let's say on the year I want to take out my supposed $1 million as my mutual funds distributions, obviously it will get taxed. If I'm bringing in that much income then of course my tax bracket will increase. And with all of the other transaction and maintenance fees that go along with it, I'm thinking I might only get around 60% of that supposed $1M. Is this a fair assessment or am I missing something? 

Same logic with a 401(k), if I balloon that to whatever amount, I'm probably going to lose 40% of that? I understand as a tax incentive now, I will not be taxed on my contributions now but when I do withdraw, I will probably be taxed on it on a higher bracket because the money grew. Higher amount = higher tax bracket right? So if I will be taxed heavier later when I'm 60 or 70 something and I'm expecting this amount and only receive maybe a little more than that, I'm not feeling to sure about that. Wouldn't it be better to be taxed on the seed than the harvest because I feel in general my taxes are going to be lower today than later on life when I've made more? 

Now if I'm so worried about taxes, that's where the Roth IRA comes in and saves me right? My only problem with that is the contribution limit (might not be enough for me) and also it is still based off of the market, meaning I WILL lose money, unless I get a fixed rate (heard a general good rule is no matter what you invest in, *NEVER* lose money as it will take more money and time to make it up). However, fixed rates are usually very low and would not even beat inflation. And again, the fees. 

Are there any other vehicles/accounts where I won't have to give up potentially half of it away to taxes and fees with substantial growth and minimal risk? Or is that too much too ask? 

**tl;dr** Upon retirement age, when withdrawing investments and accounts, I'm probably going to lose a good chunk of the money (especially if that money balloons) with Tax-deferred accounts and investments, mainly to my potential tax standing in the future.",finance,1448476852

personalfinance,Question regarding Fed Loan interest.,"I am paying back some loans through myfedloan.org and am not sure how the interest works. Currently, my total principal is about $45,000 and my unpaid interest is $640. The breakdown of my next scheduled payment says Principal: $0; Interest: $498 (my total monthly payment). My interest rate is 5.375%.

From what I understand, the interest that was expected when my loan entered repayment became part of the principal, meaning I essentially was given a total amount to pay and would pay it off in equal payments every month. I did have a period where I was unable to pay for a while so I could see how I accrued interest in addition to that which was already added to my principal.

My question is, should I be concerned that all of my payment is going towards interest? Do I need to try to make additional payments to ""catch up"" on the interest? Or is this normal? Also, how often does the interest accrue?

personalfinance,Sallie Mae says I owe them $4700 for a student loan that was distributed when I was not even a student. Please help.,"In March 2015 I was enrolled at Oregon State University online and had accepted $4700 in a federal student loan to pay for my tuition. In May 2015 my student loan still had not been distributed and the financial aid office was not responding in a timely manner so I dropped my classes and withdrew from the university.

I never received any financial aid from Oregon State University.

About a week ago I started receiving calls from Sallie Mae, the call would ask for me to call them back on their 1-800 number. On Wednesday I finally got around to calling them back and found out they are claiming I am behind on payments on a $4700 student loan that was distributed on September 15, 2015 from Oregon State University. I explained to the representative that this is impossible as I withdrew from OSU in May 2015. The representative said she could not help me and I would need to contact the financial aid office at OSU.

I immediately called OSU and the representative from the financial aid office stated that Sallie Mae mistakenly sent funds to the school for the student loan I originally requested. She then stated that these funds have already been returned to Sallie Mae and that Sallie Mae should not be contacting me regarding the manner. The representative stated she would call Sallie Mae after we got off the phone to clear up the matter.

Sallie Mae is continuing to call me everyday seeking payment, the loan has now showed up on my credit report (according to CreditKarma), and the school is telling me the only thing they can do is tell Sallie Mae to check their records as the funds have already been returned.

I have no idea where to go from here. I haven't been able to get the school to give me anything in writing that states the funds were returned to Sallie Mae. The only thing Sallie Mae is interested in is collecting payment. How should I proceed in disputing this?

personalfinance,"How loan interest works, aka ""why is half my payment going to interest""","After seeing questions or comments about things related to the question in the title one too many times, I finally wrote up an explanation of how interest and amortization and stuff works on installment loans because I haven't run across one and want something I can link to in the future.

There is a graphical version of the below at http://imgur.com/gallery/H9HuY; I encourage looking at that instead because it's prettier. However, I will attempt to reproduce the content below.

# How does loan interest work

Suppose you take out a loan to pay for college (mostly), car, house, etc. (Student loans have some unusual aspects like income-driven repayment plans, deferment, and forebearance that won't be covered. Credit cards also do not particularly work as described.)

Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of a ten year, $10,000 loan at 6% APR!

And then the first statement arrives, but it says this:

* Interest: $50.00
* Principal: $61.02
* Payment due: $111.02

And you think ""Why is the interest so high? $50 is 45% of my payment! I thought my interest was 6%?!""

# Time for some graphs! 

## (Except not, because you're not looking at the good version of this. :-))

What doesn't happen is an even breakdown of principal and interest throughout the life of the loan, unchanging month to month.

Instead, *the portion of your payment that goes toward interest and principal* **changes** *over time.*

It starts off with a lot going toward interest, but as the loan progresses that amount decreases; at the end of the loan, very little of your payments is going toward interest.

So sure, the first statement says

* Interest: $50.00
* Principal: $61.02
* Payment due: $111.02

but the last one will say

* Interest: $0.55
* Principal: $110.47
* Payment due: $111.02

That's much friendlier.

# So what does actually happen?

First, figure out how much interest we need to pay.

Multiply the current balance by the interest rate divided by 12 (because 12 months). For the example loan:

* $10,000 balance * (6% interest / 12 months) = $50

So $50 of our first payment will go toward interest. The remainder goes toward principal:

* $111.02 - $50 = $61.02 toward principal for the first month.

That principal payment reduces your balance. So for the following month, we compute:

* ($10,000 starting balance - $61.02 payment) * (6%/12) =
* $9,938.98 balance * 0.5% = $49.69 interest owed
* $111.02 payment - $49.69 = $61.33 principal paid during second month

Note that there is (slightly) more going toward principal in the second month than there was in the first. That will reduce the balance more for the third month than the first month's payment reduced the balance for the second; that will correspondingly increase the amount of payment going toward principal in the third month by more than the difference between the first and second months.

In other words, the payoff accelerates. (This is the doing of compound interest!)

# So how do we know the payment?

I like to think of the size of the monthly payment being set so that if you repeat that process every month for the desired length of the loan, you will finish with exactly a $0 balance.

To figure it out, use an online loan calculator or the PMT function in your favorite spreadsheet. Or:

* payment = (principal * rₘ) / (1 - (1 + rₘ)^(-12y))
* rₘ = APR/12 (i.e. monthly interest)
* y = number of years in loan

# A word on prepayments

A prepayment is an extra, principal-only payment you make above the required amount (the $111.02).

Prepayments reduce your balance for the following month just like the principal portion of your normal payment, and will speed up repayment of the loan and reduce the total amount of interest paid.

(Note that they will not decrease the monthly payments you make in the future, unless you can recast the loan. *Also note that some loan servicers also let you pay ahead—that is just paying early and not a prepayment* in the sense I mean here. That's almost never what you want, so make sure any extra payments you're making are actually being applied in the right place. I've given you the tools to double check your loan servicer's math. :-))

Suppose we are considering paying $30 extra per month as a prepayment on the example $10K loan.

One way to look at this is “I am only paying about 25% extra; how much difference could that make?” But from another point of view, you are increasing the amount of principal you are paying that month by almost 50%.

In fact, if you could prepay $60, you would basically be paying for the second month's principal now. That would be like cutting the second month's payment out of the schedule completely: the loan would end one month early, and, in the long run, you would not pay the interest that would have occurred in the second month. And you'd have done it paying barely half of the normal payment, because of how much of the payment goes to interest early on.

This is how even relatively small prepayments can have moderately large impacts on accelerating the repayment of a loan. (In disclaimer, a loan that is a lower interest rate, or a shorter term, would see less benefit within the loan. For example, a five-year $10,000 loan would have only about 25% of the first month's payment going toward interest.)",finance,1448512335

Using this calculator, I am getting a savings of about $20,000 off our federal taxes. http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/loan-tax-deduction-calculator.aspx

Our accountant is not very good, so I figured I would get a better answer here:

Questions:

1) Does this mean we owe $20,000 less in taxes and could potentially get a check of up to $20,000 from the IRS? 

2) Does it instead mean that our taxes will be calculated based on our income minus $20,000 as the tax basis?

personalfinance,(Alberta) I need help guys. I traded in my vehicle 2 months ago and the dealership still hasn't paid out the loan. (xpost /r/legaladvice),"I owned a 2011 Hyundai Accent (just over four years old) and this year alone I spent $3,000 on engine repairs (warranty ran out). The vehicle was becoming more of a financial burden than it was worth. So I traded it in to a dealership, they gave me enough in the trade in to cover the remaining balance on my loan and pay for the down payment on my new vehicle.

Problem is, the loan never got paid out. I've been following up with the bank every week to confirm if payment has been made yet and they still haven't received anything. The trade in happened in September. I was told the loan payout could take a couple of weeks and was advised to put a stop payment on my account so that I wasn't paying for both vehicles in the mean time.

I've notified the dealership on multiple occasions. The responses I have received so far:

* We'll look into the issue (on November 1st)
* Our notes show a cheque was sent out (November 5th)
* oh, actually it looks like the cheque was never chashed (November 6th)
* We'll reissue the cheque (November 12th)
* Ah, sorry. I'm on vacation and won't be back until the 30th. I've passed your inquiry to _____ in the finance department and she'll look into it. But our notes say we issued a new cheque on November 13th (November 25th)


I have been in touch with the bank ever week and they still have not received any payment. In addition, since it has now been two months since a payment has been made they have increased the interest rate on the loan.
What are my options? I have asked the dealership to just issue the cheque to me and I'll make the payment myself but I keep getting the run around.

Debt: No debt beyond a modest first mortgage on primary residence. No car loans, cc debt, educational debt, etc. 
For reasons that I don't necessarily want to get too into, paying down the mortgage isn't something I'd be interested in doing (not the least of which is that the interest rate is favorable to what I presume I could otherwise do with the money) 

Other investments:

* company 401k, mid 5 figures, no match (they contribute a set amount)

* various Roth and traditional IRAs - high 5-figure range in total. 

* mutual fund portfolio (brokerage account with 4 broad-sector/market funds) and random equity holdings in the mid/low 6 figures

* fully-owned rental property with a yearly ~7.5% cash ROI

the only other guiding principle here is that leveraging that money is not ideal - i'm not a huge fan of incurring personal liability on a mortgage/debt instrument to leverage this cash into a larger investment. (i could be swayed from this, though).

As a physical therapist, a good salary estimate is ~$70,000. When I get out of school I'll be sitting at ~$150,000 in student loans with an average interest rate of about 6.4%, all of which are eligible to be consolidated through the government. I am single, in my early 20s and will come out of school with almost nothing but a degree and these loans to pay off. What is the best way to pay this loan out? 

Some options that I have been considering include:

Public Service Loan Repayment - Consolidate my loans and make 120 payments (10 years) of 10-20% of my discretionary income while working for certain non-profit organizations. From what I'm told, this could end with me paying $30,000-$40,000 of my loan and the rest getting forgiven with no tax hit; Negatives being that I wouldn't have as much freedom to choose what job I want for 10 years


Military - It's a possibility (if the healtcare program includes PT next cycle) that I would get $30,000 per year active duty in addition to O-3 pay and benefits; Negatives being all the cons of being in the military.


Travel PT - I could do travel PT and make around $90,000-$100,000 per year; Negatives being the higher paying jobs are in remote areas of the USA, travel jobs usually have less benefits and I wouldn't be near my friends and family.

I've been trying to find out good information on the subject, but honestly it seems like every article I'm coming across either is paid for by a loan agency, or doesn't give a clear path on how to get things done.  Hopefully someone here can help me out!


I'm a 23 year old who graduated back in May.  My loans are just coming due now, and I'm looking to get my monthly loan payments lowered if at all possible.  The next job that I have lined up requires me to personally fundraise for my salary, and requires me to have no higher than a $600 monthly loan payment.  I'm hoping I can contribute extra funds saved towards my monthly payment to get out of debt more quickly.  Either way, the way it stands, my monthly payment is a little over $800.


My loans are split between federal (at about $35,000 inc. interest) and private with Wells Fargo (about $55,000 inc. interest).  I've reached out to my parents who have reached out to people as well, but it doesn't seem like it's getting anywhere.  That's why I figured I'd ask you guys!


I'm currently working part-time as an intern at a church, but am going to be looking for more work to cover my bills.  The job I will be working towards that will require fundraising is a non-profit, and should count towards the government's ""debt forgiveness program"" as far as I understand.  I'm not sure if I can enroll in this after consolidation, but I'd love more information on it if at all possible!


My main question is, what is the best way to get this process started, and what should I be looking for?  Is it best to contact the company that gave me my private loans, or a third party?  What's a good interest rate I could settle for, and what are some red flags to look out for?  Is there a way to consolidate federal loans by themselves and still get enrolled in the program?


Sorry about all the questions, I feel a little helpless right now with the recent push to get these all consolidated and figured out.  I'd love to hear what you guys think!

CC with about $4,500 on it, typically what I've been doing is basically leaving as little as possible in my chequing account then putting it all on the CC each month. 

**Savings:**
Company has a match of 50% of the first 5% of my pay I put in, I currently have $2K set aside, here's where this one is interesting, I'm trying to keep this one going, I was sold off to a new entity and when the deal closes in a little over a year I get access to the full amount, not just my portion which is a guaranteed return of 50%.

Estimate is that in march my tax return will be $4K, the remaining of my student tax credits 

**Goals,**
* have my CC under $1K by the end of April
* Build an emergency fund of $5K for unexpected emergencies (roughly 2 months bills) - want to use the tax return as the base of this.

gaming,"With Permission from the mods, I'd like to talk about the failure of a few punishment systems inside of games","Specifically, the ones in league and how this might affect gaming over all.

Hello, I'm someone who loves honor system. I originally started playing starcraft in high school 14 or so years ago. I picked it up again around 2007 after a break up, like a lot of you I was attracted to gaming out the tinge of loneliness, and learned I loved the small communities of starcraft and their custom games.

In league, because of my love of my teammates, I regularly achieved an avg of 1.5 honor per ranked game. I did this through phrases that would mitigate the problems like ""Hey, you're never gonna see each other after this, why bother fighting.""

However, around s3 something changed in the system. My efforts, which had previously been super successful in getting teams to work together suddenly had the opposite effect. 

I'm not going to get into it, but I feel like, between seasons 3 and now we've slowly gone from a fun gaming environment that was slightly plagued with griefers, to an environment where griefers completely know and manipulate our system. People who don't manipulate it, don't stand a chance and that includes good-experience team mates like myself.

For me personally, I noticed the if I spoke too much -- even if I was just asking someone if something happened in their life that was making them feel alright about hurting their in game friends would warrant things like chat bans. 

I also noticed in s3 that now certain champions that I played would incur reports and certain champions wouldn't. If you look at this chart, you can see that it's not that the community voted on
which champion was the most toxic, it was which champions could carry the hardest: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1ynzsg/champions_played_by_the_most_toxic_players_chart/

I was a filthy dirty teemo / quinn lover at the time and many people told me to my face ""report for quinn, report for teemo."" It worked. More and more I was put into lower and lower priority queues. I reached out to Lyte over twitter and asked about it and he immediately blocked on twitter. So I started asking the president about it, Marc Merrill. He just retweeted some stuff about teamwork from coaches. Oddly relevant to my situation.

After that, about a month later I experienced a 8 d/c game and the only other person was a variant of  ""Let's start over.""

I said over #/all I want an apology. 


I think that's fair. My long standing honor ribbon was gone. My long standing honor points were in constant fear of being removed. I hadn't changed yet. 


What did this do? It stopped me from using my tactics anymore that stopped infighting. Instead being the epitome of the summoners code, I became just another player. 


I also refused to give up Quinn. I'd play other roles/champions if needed, but if I could pick Quinn top or Quinn Jungle I would. My win rate was pretty good but constantly hampered by people who would troll because of my pick. Not that it was the wrong pick for the comp, simply because they had been beaten by a quinn once.


Now let's get to my point. ""Those people."" They still aren't punished. I eventually, because of constant griefing, snapped and one game told someone I wish they had been aborted. It was someone who ran down my lane over and over again similar to malphite in dunkey's ban. 

Except unlike dunkey, I was still altruistic and felt bad for saying it and spent the rest of the gaming protecting the griefer/feeder shyvana and won the game for us with my galio.

#I was banned for that, and yes, that type of behavior is not acceptable.

However, the feeding shyvana was never ever punished nor banned. It's pretty common knowledge that ""Silent Griefing"" in league of legends is never punished.  If you simply state you did your best, no matter what you do, you won't be punished. On the Riot's forums, most people even have 2-3 accounts dedicated to griefing and brag about it.  For Reference: https://riotlyte.com/SilentGriefers.html


What does that do to other players? Well, I've grown more emotional armor towards something I shouldn't have to deal with. I've stopped being honorrific and a great teammate and became more greedy.

Here is an example of a chat ban log when you are paired with these griefers:
https://riotlyte.com/MitTalk.html

It's at the bottom.



#How Does this matter to /r/gaming

The reason is, the guys in social system often look at each other's ideas and listen to each other's research. I feel like, not only is this system not working but being a negative influence on game. 

For example, you get griefed in league of legends, you get told you're the asshole for saying something like ""please stop intentionally feeding"" and then you don't rise above.

Some people rise above. I know I try my hardest. The rest of the population, and you know it's true, is simply going to imitate the behavior. This is all over the forums and it will leak into other games (if it hasn't already).

Side note: I only have a picture of me dropping off the package at the dropbox. FedEx says since it was the incorrect dropbox, the driver should have either put the package in a nearby correct dropbox, or sorted it out at the facility. However, the tracking number doesn't even show it was scanned.

edit 3: Got an email from LR earlier today, saying that they contacted FedEx and said the case was closed and they want the payout.. Seemingly odd, because I didn't hear anything from them.. So I called and confirmed that it was still an OPEN case. I find their aggressiveness to get a fast payout really odd.. 
&amp;nbsp;

edit 4: So the price difference to pay is $1600, not $2400, as I asked earlier in a phone convo if the item can be replaced with another used camera body, since the used market is much.. much cheaper.. The rep said that this was an error and the camera itself was at the end of its life cycle, so they would accept $1600.. Questionably odd, since I had to ASK them about the USED item price, while in the meanwhile being assured by their rep that ""hes doing everything he can and has looked into everything""..

edit 5: In hindsight, I guess I shouldve recorded a video, instead of taking a measly photograph with my phone.. (Next time obviously use a facility and get a receipt..)",finance,1448640430

I am a second year Masters student in a Canadian University and my stipend is 16.5K a year (untaxed). This year I received two full time TAships and I will be making an additional $9000 (taxed). I decided to put my TA money directly into my savings account, so that I could do some travelling or help me move to a different city after I graduate. 

After speaking to some of my colleagues, apparently I should be investing this money and keeping money in a savings account is stupid because you lose money in the long run (interest rates are not fixed to inflation). 

Investing makes me feel uncomfortable because A) I don't understand how the market works and B) I witnessed my dad have a nervous breakdown during the 2008 market crash.

personalfinance,Which debts to pay off first,"Hi all! I find myself in a really good position, and I want to use my money wisely. I've been in pretty bad financial positions before (no food, can't make rent) and I want to make sure that doesn't happen again.  

So, here's the deal. I just landed a new gig which will allow me to pay all of my household's bills on my own. (Household consists of me, husband and three kids.)  

Basically this leaves my husband's pay checks fair game. My question is...what do we do?  

I know we need an emergency fund, but I'm not sure how much. We will have about $2k Monday from some side gigs I've completed. My goal has been to get to $5k. Is that too high? Too low?  

My first instinct to go after the mortgage and get it paid off. (Having spent time without a home, I'm terrified of having that happen again.)  

There are other debts too: 
Mortgage - $89,990  
Stu loan 1 - $19,000  
Stu loan 2 - $9,000  
Stu loan 3 - $7,000  
Stu loan 4 - $4,000  
Stu loan 5 - &lt;$1,000  
Car loan 1 - $13,900  
Car loan 2 - $14,200  
Credit cards - &lt;$2,000  

We should have between $1,800-$2,000/month extra to throw at these debts. Currently the plan is to save up a $5k emergency fund and then double down on the debts.  

Everything I've read says to target the credit cards first as they have the highest interest rates, but that won't take long. After that, what do I target next?  

I should mention that the stu loans are income-based right now ... meaning I'm not paying much toward them at the moment. The $7k loan is one I'm taking over from my dad, and the smallest two aren't in repayment right now as my husband is still going to school.

It has a 6.8% interest rate. I am currently enrolled in the Income based repayment plan. For those that are not familiar with it, the plan monthly payments are 15% of your (discretionary income) adjusted gross income after they deduct 150% of the poverty guideline for the size of your family where you live. After 25 years of payments any remainder is forgiven but there are taxes on the amount forgiven. Should be noted your calculated payment will never exceed the amount of what your standard ten repayment would have been regardless of how much you make.

Until recently I was not working yet so a 15% payment of almost 0 was 0.  It was pretty straight forward. 

Now I have my first job. I am single and make 75k a year. I obviously want to get rid of debt but also don't know if paying ahead is a good decision. I conservatively believe ill be making over 100k within the next 5 years based on promotions. And am unsure how much my income will continue to grow beyond that but with the lifestyle I enjoy it will just be extra savings. I confidently feel I can contribute close to $3000 a month for at least a few years  to loans or other savings/investments.

I  feel that I should try to pay as little as possible and just let it go for 25 years until it's forgiven. But with interest getting added and my income rising I fear my total amount repaid would be much larger than simply living simply for the near future and pay a significant amount of the loan down now.

Please advise! Pay as much extra as I can afford and live in a filthy apartment or just keep paying what I am required under the repayment plan until it's forgiven.

What may add a twist is if I am not putting that extra money towards the loans it will be saved for a down payment on a duplex or multi-unit building as a residence and investment.

Schmidt had taken over as CEO of Google in 2001 and built it into an empire.

Schmidt plunged in [to the interview] at the deep end, straightaway quizzing me on the organizational and technological underpinnings of WikiLeaks.

Schmidt was a good foil. A late-fiftysomething, squint-eyed behind owlish spectacles, managerially dressed—Schmidt’s dour appearance concealed a machinelike analyticity. His questions often skipped to the heart of the matter, betraying a powerful nonverbal structural intelligence. 

It was at this point that I realized Eric Schmidt might not have been an emissary of Google alone. Whether officially or not, he had been keeping some company that placed him very close to Washington, D.C., including a well-documented relationship with President Obama. Not only had Hillary Clinton’s people known that Eric Schmidt’s partner had visited me, but they had also elected to use her as a back channel. 

I began to think of Schmidt as a brilliant but politically hapless Californian tech billionaire who had been exploited by the very U.S. foreign-policy types he had collected to act as translators between himself and official Washington.

I was wrong.

Eric Schmidt was born in Washington, D.C., where his father had worked as a professor and economist for the Nixon Treasury. He attended high school in Arlington, Virginia, before graduating with a degree in engineering from Princeton.

In 1979, Schmidt headed out West to Berkeley, where he received his Ph.D. before joining Stanford/ Berkeley spin-off Sun Microsystems in 1983. By the time he left Sun, sixteen years later, he had become part of its executive leadership.

Sun had significant contracts with the U.S. government, but it was not until he was in Utah as CEO of Novell that records show Schmidt strategically engaging Washington’s overt political class. Federal campaign finance records show that on January 6, 1999, Schmidt donated two lots of $1,000 to the Republican senator for Utah, Orrin Hatch. On the same day Schmidt’s wife, Wendy, is also listed giving two lots of $1,000 to Senator Hatch.

By the start of 2001, over a dozen other politicians and PACs, including Al Gore, George W. Bush, Dianne Feinstein, and Hillary Clinton, were on the Schmidts’ payroll, in one case for $100,000.

By 2013, Eric Schmidt—who had become publicly over-associated with the Obama White House—was more politic. Eight Republicans and eight Democrats were directly funded, as were two PACs. That April, $32,300 went to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. A month later the same amount, $32,300, headed off to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Why Schmidt was donating exactly the same amount of money to both parties is a $64,600 question.

It was also in 1999 that Schmidt joined the board of a Washington, D.C.–based group: the New America Foundation, a merger of well-connected centrist forces (in D.C. terms). The foundation and its 100 staff serve as an influence mill, using its network of approved national security, foreign policy and technology pundits to place hundreds of articles and op-eds per year.

By 2008, Schmidt had become chairman of its board of directors. As of 2013 the New America Foundation’s principal funders (each contributing over $1 million) were listed as Eric and Wendy Schmidt, the U.S. State Department and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Secondary funders include Google, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Radio Free Asia.

**Schmidt’s involvement in the New America Foundation places him firmly in the Washington establishment nexus.** The foundation’s other board members, seven of whom also list themselves as members of the Council on Foreign Relations, include Francis Fukuyama, one of the intellectual fathers of the neoconservative movement; Rita Hauser, who served on the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board under both Bush and Obama; Jonathan Soros, the son of George Soros; Walter Russell Mead, a U.S. security strategist and editor of the American Interest; Helene Gayle, who sits on the boards of Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, the Rockefeller Foundation, the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Policy Unit, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the White House Fellows program and Bono’s ONE Campaign; and Daniel Yergin, oil geo-strategist, former chair of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Task Force.

There was nothing politically hapless about Eric Schmidt. I had been too eager to see a politically unambitious Silicon Valley engineer, a relic of the good old days of computer science graduate culture on the West Coast. **But that is not the sort of person who attends the Bilderberg conference four years running, who pays regular visits to the White House, or who delivers “fireside chats” at the World Economic Forum in Davos.**

Schmidt’s emergence as Google’s “foreign minister”—making pomp and ceremony state visits across geopolitical fault lines—had not come out of nowhere; it had been presaged by years of assimilation within U.S. establishment networks of reputation and influence.

But Google’s chairman is a classic “head of industry” player, with all of the ideological baggage that comes with that role. Schmidt fits exactly where he is: the point where the centrist, liberal and imperialist tendencies meet in American political life.

By all appearances, Google’s bosses genuinely believe in the civilizing power of enlightened multinational corporations, and they see this mission as continuous with the shaping of the world according to the better judgment of the “benevolent superpower.” They will tell you that open-mindedness is a virtue, but all perspectives that challenge the exceptionalist drive at the heart of American foreign policy will remain invisible to them. This is the impenetrable banality of “don’t be evil.” They believe that they are doing good. And that is a problem.

Google is different. Google is visionary. Google is the future. Google is more than just a company. Google gives back to the community. Google is a force for good.

Even when Google airs its corporate ambivalence publicly, it does little to dislodge these items of faith. The company’s reputation is seemingly unassailable. Google’s colorful, playful logo is imprinted on human retinas just under 6 billion times each day, 2.1 trillion times a year—an opportunity for respondent conditioning enjoyed by no other company in history.

Caught red-handed last year making petabytes of personal data available to the U.S. intelligence community through the PRISM program, Google nevertheless continues to coast on the goodwill generated by its “don’t be evil” doublespeak. A few symbolic open letters to the White House later and it seems all is forgiven. Even anti-surveillance campaigners cannot help themselves, at once condemning government spying but trying to alter Google’s invasive surveillance practices using appeasement strategies.

Nobody wants to acknowledge that Google has grown big and bad. But it has. Schmidt’s tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation. 

In 2003, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) had already started systematically violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) under its director General Michael Hayden. These were the days of the “Total Information Awareness” program. Before PRISM was ever dreamed of, under orders from the Bush White House the NSA was already aiming to “collect it all, sniff it all, know it all, process it all, exploit it all.”

During the same period, Google—whose publicly declared corporate mission is to collect and “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”—was accepting NSA money to the tune of $2 million to provide the agency with search tools for its rapidly accreting hoard of stolen knowledge.

In 2010, after the Chinese government was accused of hacking Google, the company entered into a “formal information-sharing” relationship with the NSA, which was said to allow NSA analysts to “evaluate vulnerabilities” in Google’s hardware and software. Although the exact contours of the deal have never been disclosed, the NSA brought in other government agencies to help, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.

Around the same time, Google was becoming involved in a program known as the “Enduring Security Framework” (ESF), which entailed the sharing of information between Silicon Valley tech companies and Pentagon-affiliated agencies “at network speed.” Emails obtained in 2014 under Freedom of Information requests show Schmidt and his fellow Googler Sergey Brin corresponding on first-name terms with NSA chief General Keith Alexander about ESF.

Reportage on the emails focused on the familiarity in the correspondence: “General Keith…so great to see you…!” Schmidt wrote. But most reports over-looked a crucial detail. “Your insights as a key member of the Defense Industrial Base,” Alexander wrote to Brin, “are valuable to ensure ESF’s efforts have measurable impact.”

Whether it is being just a company or “more than just a company,” Google’s geopolitical aspirations are firmly enmeshed within the foreign-policy agenda of the world’s largest superpower. As Google’s search and Internet service monopoly grows, and as it enlarges its industrial surveillance cone to cover the majority of the world’s population, rapidly dominating the mobile phone market and racing to extend Internet access in the global south, Google is steadily becoming the Internet for many people. Its influence on the choices and behavior of the totality of individual human beings translates to real power to influence the course of history.

A “don’t be evil” empire is still an empire.

personalfinance,"Should I co-invest in an apartment in Iceland with my brother, live in it and pay him rent until he wants to sell or I want to move out?","This is the current situation: My brother and I live in Sweden, I might be moving to Iceland. My brother and his family are planning to move to Iceland in about 5 years, give or take, and they want to start paying the mortgage so they will be in a better position to buy a home of their own when they move to Iceland. Given the insane housing situation in the Reykjavik area, it is very common to have landlords who rent out to locals during low tourist seasons and then rent out to tourists during the tourist season. They make 2-3 times more money that way. 

So I would benefit because I would have an apartment for as long as I want to live there or until they want to sell it when they move home again. 

And regarding the financial details he suggested that I could pay part of the 15% down payment for the mortgage. And when they sell or I move I would get the same percentage back. The housing market in the Reykjavik area is, as far as I understand it, in a bubble, so I expect it to pop in the coming years. In that case I would likely lose money if I get the same percentage back that I payed for the down payment. So an alternative would be that we agreed on a fixed interest rate, that way I would be guaranteed a definite sum back, but I would potentially get less back compared to if I got the same percentage back that I put in to the down payment. 

He also said that I would pay the going market rate in rent and that makes sense. 

But then there's the dilemma of essentially giving my brother money so he can profit off of me. And money is too often a source of conflict in families so I am hesitant for that reason as well. We would obviously sign a renting contract and an agreement regarding the loan I make to them but that wouldn't guarantee a healthy relationship if anything goes wrong along the way. And my biggest issue is that my brother would profit off of me. Yet at the same time I would have a stable living arrangement in a crazy housing market. 

What do you think? If we focus on the financial aspect first, does it make sense? 

And regarding the moral dilemma, what are your thoughts on renting from family and essentially have them profit off of you?

There is nothing that precludes me from buying an apartment myself, but the dilemma is the looming housing bubble and the crazy renting situation, it's a significant risk to buy and a major gamble to rent.",finance,1448706742

personalfinance,"I'm a paid intern, is that the same as a ""private contractor"". Employer my be trying to pull a fast one... [Taxes]","Okay here goes; I tried to do as much research as I could for myself, but I could use confirmation. Here's the backstory:

I try to work internships for every school break and continue part-time while I'm taking college classes. I live in New Hampshire and work in Massachusetts (just so people know where I pay taxes). Here's the discrepancy I noticed:

I worked for Company A (250+ employees) from June 2014 until September 2015. I always recieved what I assumed to be a standard ADP pay stub with all federal withholding accounted for. Being a New Hampshire resident I get almost all of my income tax back as I am 22 years old. Filed my taxes as usual, no issues, so everything was pretty standard until I began at company B.

I started working at company B on a 3-month internship and noticed something odd about my paycheck. Company B is a small company with 13 people who also uses ADP for payroll. When I got my first check I noticed no federal withholding were removed and I was being paid literally rate multiplied by hours worked. I didn't think anything of it until I talked to a friend who is a tax accounting major who thought that seemed ""off"".

He surmised that company B was trying to bill me as an independent contractor and therefore I would receive a 1099 instead of the tried and true W-2. He said this would leave me on the hook for an additional percentage (~5% I believe he said) of the usual withholdings (Medicaid, Medicare, whatever else). He went on to say that the IRS would likely frown on this and if caught company B would likely be fined for this practice.

I did some research on the distinction of ""independent contractor"" and I have reason to believe I don't fit that bill because:

1) My employer dictates when and how long I work

2) They tell me where I have to show up to work

3) I have no refusal over the work I do

Here's the conundrum:

If I ask the CEO of this small company about what appears to be going on I believe he'd level with me and tell me the truth whatever it may be. Should I:

1) Accept the independent contractor distinction and swallow the losses (I'm a paid intern, I'm lucky to be paid at all, it's just 5%). No one is any the wiser and the world keeps on turning. The only reason I'd do this is it protects my potential for employment when I graduate college in May.

2) I don't think I can change the distinction now as this was never discussed with me when I was hired and I'm stuck with it, but is it possible to change the status of my employment now with 2 weeks left on this internship.

3) Report company B to the IRS (company B would know I did this as I think I'm the only employee who has this distinction in a company of 13), company B would be fined as I understand it, but I'd still be out the extra money. This would probably kill my chances of possibly working for this company on graduation, which admittedly may or may not be a possibility, but I work hard and they've slipped me hints that they may be interested.

personalfinance,[Canada]. What is the best type of investment to use for my future house down-payment funds?,"30M here. Looking to figure out the best investment vehicle to place my future-down-payment savings into [Canada]. I have $20,000 to invest (and add to) with a 2-4 year time horizon, with parameters as below:

My stats:  
    * I'm in a professional career with stable employment, with opportunity to become self-employed in my profession if I ever lose my job.    
    * My emergency savings fund is at about 2 months' expenses, but is growing at a rate of one month's growth every year. When 2016 ends, I will have 3 months' savings. When 2017 ends, I will have 4 months' savings, etc.   
    * I have a $88,000 line of credit that I'm paying down, from the student loans of my professional degree. It's not a public loan, interest is not tax-deductible, but it has a locked-in interest rate of 2.5% for the next 5 years.  
    * From my pre-professional days, I have an employer-matched RRSP program. I have $13,000 invested in a market-indexed mutual fund. However I have **not** claimed RRSP deductions from the contributions. Therefore, it can be withdrawn and moved without adding income and without penalty.  
    * I won't be paying income taxes in 2015, because my tuition credits eat up 100% of income. Claiming RRSP deductions to lower my income therefore isn't an option this year.  
* I've done the rent vs. buy calculations for my area, and buying makes the most sense for me in my circumstances.  
* My home purchase is a 2-4 year window from now  
* I have a new $7,000 windfall, plus the $13,000 in RRSPs to save towards a down-payment. A total of $20,000 that I will be adding to, and want to be using in 2-4 year time horizon.      

Assumption:  
    * If I use the windfall and/or the unclaimed RRSP funds to lower the line of credit, I cannot re-withdraw the funds when it comes time to purchase the house. The lenders will not let you use borrowed funds to make a down-payment. I need to keep the money outside of the line of credit.
- I have plenty of TFSA room available.

Questions:  
Where should I put the $20,000, and the money I will be adding to it? Should I leave it/put it into RRSP, and use the first-time homebuyer's program to remove it? Should I transfer it all to TFSA immediately?   
When inside each Plan, should I be using a indexed stock mix, an index bond mix, pure GIC's, or something inbetween? Should I be worried about trying to outperform my 2.5% line of credit?

personalfinance,27 years old. Savings gone. Too much credit card debt. Don't know where to start.,"I work for a municipal government and been there for nearly 3 years. My job is secured and have no worries about that.  What I do worry about is my high level of debt. 

My salary is right at $40,000 a year before taxes, health-care, retirement, etc. So 1,666 per pay period twice a month. Take home is right around 1200 per pay period. 

I live with my best friend in a modest two bedroom apartment. My rent is $715/month. Utilities at around 60/month. My share of the Internet bill is 35/month.  I pay for covered parking at $35/month due to my odd work hours. I get home late and there's just not any parking in the area. It's the only way I can not have to walk 10 minutes each way. I know I sound kind of entitled here but I do enjoy having a guaranteed spot every night at 11pm. We don't have cable. My cellphone bill is roughly 90/month on tmobile. That's with the 30 dollar a month phone finance. 

I bought a brand new car a few years back. It is financed through penfed. I owe about 10,500 on it. Minimum monthly payments are 412. I have a motorcycle with no lien on it. I'm insured with state Farm with those two vehicles plus renters for about 160 a month. Car has full, bike has liability. 

Credit card debt. This is the biggie. I owe roughly 17,000 in credit card debt. Luckily most of it is low interest. 10% and under. 5k of it is high interest from one back at around 18%. I was stupid these past few years transferring debt from one credit card to a new one with a 0% promotional balance transfer rate. But I kept increasing my debt by living beyond my means. I want to focus on obliterating this debt. Here are my monthly expenses that must be paid:

Cell phone: $90
State Farm insurance: $160
Rent, utilities, Internet: $840ish
Car payment: $420

Here are my average expenses for other things:
Dog/cat food: I buy it in bulk so on average this is $40/month 
Groceries: $150 to $200 per month 
Take out: Easily at least $150 per month which I am focusing on cutting back dramatically
Entertainment: ~$100/month

Right now I normally spend $1000 a month on paying credit cards. Obviously it isn't working since I somehow spend more than what I pay off. This has to change. 

I'm really considering selling my motorcycle for about $2,500 to $3,000 but that's a small dent on my debt. It was my pride and joy when I bought it in cash but now it's just a toy that I don't deserve until I clear some debt. I want to wait until the spring to sell it due to higher demand. 

In July I'll be taking our police officer test. If I pass I'll hopefully be in training by December of next year and make 53k base pay. 

Currently I have less than $100 in my checking (just paid rent and car payment with last paycheck) and $200 in savings. I feel pitiful that in an adult male with a professional job and this is all I got. 

I have thick skin so no need to be nice.

politics,A few words of warning about The Tax Foundation,"About two weeks ago, I saw a post entitled [""How Scandinavian Countries Pay for Their Government Spending""](https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3squsk/how_scandinavian_countries_pay_for_their/) rising on /r/dataisbeautiful.  It was fairly quickly removed for not linking directly to the original source and then deleted by the OP, but I want to raise a point about the importance of knowing who your sources are when we talk about politics (and in general).

While the [Tax Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Foundation) describes itself as a non-partisan tax research group, [that could not be much further from the truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Foundation#History).


&gt;The Tax Foundation was organized on December 5, 1937 in New York City by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., Chairman of the General Motors Corporation; Donaldson Brown, GM Financial Vice President; William S. Farish, President of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (Exxon); and Lewis H. Brown, President of Johns-Manville Corporation, who later became the first Chairman of the Board of The Tax Foundation. The stated goal of the organization was ""to monitor the tax and spending policies of government agencies"". Its offices were located at 50 Rockefeller Plaza and later 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
The Tax Foundation's first project was a successful effort to stop a tax increase in Westchester County, New York, where they provided research and analysis (including an ""Expenditure Survey"" of state spending) to local activists. By 1943, the Tax Foundation had helped set up taxpayers associations and expenditure councils in 35 states.

In this specific case of the Tax Foundation's analysis of taxes in the US versus taxes in Scandinavian countries, one big takeaway is that the Tax Foundation wants the US to have lower corporate tax rates:

&gt;Marginal corporate tax rates in Scandinavian countries are around the OECD average of 25 percent and much more competitive than the United States’ rate. Denmark’s corporate income tax rate is 24.5 percent, Norway’s general corporate income tax rate is 27 percent, and Sweden has a corporate tax rate of 22 percent. The U.S. marginal tax rate on corporations is much higher at 39.1 percent (average of federal and state).

They neglect to mention that [the effective corporate tax rate in the US is about 12.6%](http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/01/news/economy/corporate-tax-rate/), which would fly in the face of their implicit claim that the US forces corporations to pay too much in taxes.  To be fair, they do mention that corporate tax revenue as a percentage of GDP is on par with or lower than the Scandinavian countries, but they fail to mention that this is because of the many deductions and regulatory loopholes that permeate the US tax code.

Always know your source and what their agenda is.",energy,1448733888

personalfinance,"How can a hapless grad student get his finances in order? ($12,000 credit card debt)","I feel a little silly asking because I'm an economist and come from a privileged financial background, but I've recently let my finances get pretty out of control and I'd really appreciate some advice from the community.

I just moved to the UK to start work on my PhD. I've had a credit card for a long time but I only ever used it sparingly and paid it off in full every month. It has a limit of $12,000, of which I never exceeded maybe 2,000. 

That changed somewhat two months ago, when I first moved to Oxford. I bought the plane tickets last minute so they were very expensive and my house was completely unfurnished. Coming from the bay area, I also needed a pretty different and more professional wardrobe for the climate/setting. 

I'm not the most extravagant person, but I have to admit that I wasn't exactly judicious in my spending and a lot of things I bought were probably unnecessarily expensive. I'm very satisfied with them but, in retrospect, there were probably better deals to be had if I had looked for them.

My girlfriend also came over to Europe for our anniversary and I surprised her with a trip to Capri which was pretty spendy. 

To cut a long story short, I ended up racking up $12,000 in charges to my card that month and I'm not exactly sure how to best tackle it. It was sort of a wake up call and inspired me to take a closer look at my finances and what I could/should be doing better.

Here's an outline of my current situation:


Income (post-tax):

$1,200/per month

Two $5,000 payments/ year

Usually a few thousand more from family members for my birthday/Christmas 


Expenses:

Housing and tuition fees are covered by a fellowship, so all of my spending is either discretionary or on food. I don't know exactly how much I spend a month, but recent events have inspired me to look into it more closely. 

Debts:

$12,000 credit card debt - relatively low but obviously still undesirable interest rate

$30,000 mortgage (on a house my sister and I co-own) - very low interest rate, pretty much pays for itself through rent


Obviously the most pressing concern is the credit card debt. Since I first maxed it out in September, I've made payments $1,200 (my disposable income each month), but the level of debt hasn't really gone down because it turns out I've been spending about that much on the card each month since then ( in addition to paying around $100/month in interest)

One of my two yearly payments if $5,000 just cleared my account, so I have the chance to reduce my debt pretty substantially and plan on doing so. It won't cover all of it though, so I need to figure out a plan to pay it all off and try to prevent something similar from happening again.

 I own quite a bit of stock and I'm somewhat tempted to sell some to cover the difference, but I'm worried about setting a precedent of eating into my assets in order to finance my day to day spending. When I get my next $5,000 dollar payment, I should be able to take care of another big chunk of the debt,but I'm not sure if it's wise to let it fester for six more months. I've never had real credit card debt before so I'm not exactly sure how urgently I need to address it. Should I sell stock immediately to pay it off? Just sit on it until I get a few more big payments? Until I get a job in s few years time?

Like I said, I'd also appreciate some more general financial advice. I realize that I'm in a pretty fortunate spot financially and want  to make the most of it or at the very least not squander what I've been given. I have ~$100,000 dollars worth of stock in my name and own a house worth about $650,000 with my sister, so I'm starting from a fairly good place. Part of me thinks should just enjoy being carefree and young and start worrying about all that when I graduate and get a real (hopefully well paid) job. But I just can't help but think that my future self will thank me if I can get my finances in order now and actually invest some of my income rather than spend it as soon as I get it.

I work in the military and currently make roughly $51,000 a year (including housing and food allowance with taxes/social security/medicare subtracted). I've also saved up $10,000 in the last year with $7,000 left in student loans.

I've done some searching on the Internet and the general consensus from google seems to be to spend only 10-20% of your annual income for your car. This limits me to mostly used cars.

However, my family's advice is to buy a new car since old used cars tend to have problems. Their concerns are that older models generally aren't as reliable and the maintenance fees to fix them can often be as expensive as simply buying a new car. I'll probably be sticking with the same car for the next decade so my family contacted their broker and are suggesting either a 2015 Nissan Altima or a 2016 Nissan Maxima S. They got the following prices. The Altima is $21,000 with 1% APR. The Maxima is $31,000 with 1% APR.

We told our bank we wanted to keep our monthly repayments the same and as a result for this past year we have effectively been making a mini over payment of about £15 a month. I am trying to create a spreadsheed that will simply project forward the life of our mortgage if we are able to overpay the maximum 10% each year.

Whilst the mortgage is fairly large this overpayment is negligible, however towards the middle of the mortgage our monthly payments would have a fairly significant impact into the 10% allowance.

For example if we currently owe £100,000 then we can pay a maximum of £10,000 this year (ignoring the 15x12). The bank will then recalculate the amount based on our interest rate 3.19% and also the monthly rate to keep the length of the mortgage the same term. I would just like to know how they do this because it isn't just a case of dividing that amount by the number of months left on the mortgage. Any tips with this would be really useful, thanks.",finance,1448808168
personalfinance,Student Loan/Credit Reporting Issue,"Hey guys-

I have student loans in the amount of 30,000 with FedLoan Servicing. I checked my credit report, and I noticed that they had reported my nonpayment for the last few months. This is a mistake I had made - I had fallen on hard times, and had to pick between paying or eating.

Anyway, this is really negatively affecting my credit report, and I have since applied and received forbearance. I saw that forbearance would not assist in past credit reporting.

Does anyone have any suggestions for me? I want to get this off my report if I can. Do you think contacting FedLoan Serving would do me any good?",finance,1448812965

I have some serious student loan debt and I see no other way out.
I originally went to school to get my associates in animation, and then went on to get my bachelors in game design. I did some work in the industry, but a lot of the jobs went overseas or became nonexistent.  I went back to school and got associates in accounting technician thinking I could be a quiet paper pusher.

I got a temp job but suffered illness due to medication withdrawal. (Made too much money with the job and lost health insurance through state).  This affected my anxiety levels leaving me sick every time I try to start looking for work. I knew I had an anxiety disorder in college, but had my meds to push me through it.
My husband has a temp job, but only has one month left on his contract. At the moment his net pay a week is around $550 after taxes.
My social anxiety disorder and depression make me too sick for an everyday job.  I am trying to write and illustrate a children's book but I doubt the money I make from this endeavor could ever pay back the money I owe.  My husband and I live with my parents.

The 401k options were good there, so I started a small 401k, but had less than $1,000 in it by the time I left the company.

I have my vehicle financed through chrysler capital it was my first vehicle purchase i had very little credit history so i got a high interest percent.

I proceeded to sign the check and forward it to chrysler capital, I sent it the beginning of october and it posted on the 8th of october. My balance with Chrysler capital was at $0 at that point. But after a couple days the balance showed up again on my chrysler account. I called them, they told me there had been a stop on the check and that the funds weren't available. I called penfed they told me the check has been cashed , that they no longer have that money, I call chrysler capital and they again tell me the check was stopped so they tell me to ask penfed for a ""running bank statement"" and fax it to them so they have proof the check was cashed and so that they can look into the situation, so I call penfed again and ask for the ""running bank statement"" they tell me they can write a letter for me indicating what day and by whom the check was cashed so I did. They faxed me and chrysler capital a copy.  Chrysler capital tells me it is not enough information that they need a ""running bank statement"" so I call penfed again and tell them that. They tell me they can send me a copy of the check image, front and back showing when and by whom it was cashed so again i say ok.  So I fax it to chrysler capital and when I talked to them they again told me that wasn't enough information they need a ""running bank statement"".  I asked why? the check image has everything they should need.  It shows chysler capitals stamp and on what day it was cashed, but they refuse it so again I call penfed and they tell me as far as documents thats all they can provide for me. So I ask what do they suggest i do and they tell me to continue talking to chyrsler capital and fix it with them since they no longer have that money.  I call chrysler capital and they tell me they where going to send the check image to the accounting department so they could review it so I wait days for that calling everyday for an update and after a week or so they tell me its not enough they need a ""running bank statement"".  I again call penfed and tell them and they tell me there is nothing they can do.  So right now im having to pay both loans till the issue gets fixed.

personalfinance,Thanks for your help PF - I've managed to become debt free thanks to hard work and some unexpected generosity! (Longish),"First off just want to say a big thank you to all you guys out in PF. When I first decided to work towards becoming debt free, you helped guide me and then kept me motivated along the way. 

I'm a 26 year old office worker in Auckland, New Zealand. I got into debt over a period of a few years after becoming sick with depression and not being able to work for a few months (having to live off my credit cards) combine with bad decisions (i.e impulse shopping that made me feel temporarily better when I wasn't doing so well) and my car breaking down and not being able to be repaired. 

By the time I decided to get debt free my situation looked like this:

Credit Card 1: $2,800 - pretty much constantly maxed out at a resonably high interest rate. Every time I paid money down on it, I would use it almost straight away to buy something. 

Credit Card 2: $3,000 - same as above! 

Personal Bank Loan (for car): $8,000 - Needed a car for work and wanted to get something that wouldn't break down like the old one did (so far so good). 

Overdraft: $2,000 - got this when I was a student in one of their student deals. 

Various loans from friends/family: $600.00

So overall not a huge amount of money but my family has always been relatively poor and this amount was almost overwhelming when I finally faced up to it 2 years ago. I calcualted on my income ($30,000 after tax) that if I stuck to my budget and stayed on the same income (although I hoped to get raises) that I would pay off my debt by late 2017/early 2018. 

I put myself on a relatively strict budget - still gave myself a little spending money for socialising / events etc since I knew that if I didn't, I could easily fall back into depression which would decrease my earning potential quickly. It was a trade off between staying healthy mentally and taking a little longer to get debt free. Rent is high in my city and my commute was long so petrol was expensive but I cut out heaps of extras to make sure I could pay off the debt. 

I've always found it hard to stay to a budget in the past so I used a few strategies to make sure I did. I decided to take my spending money out in cash so I wouldn't see money in my bank account and think ""ooohh lots of money to spend"" and use money that should have been for bills etc. This was probably the biggest help for me. I also tracked my debt repayments in my planner and actually started getting excited seeing the debt diminish little by little each week. I also designed a ""Debt Motiviation Sheet"" where I brainstormed all the reasons I wanted to be debt free (money for a wedding one day, to buy a house, so I won't be a burden on a future partner, to be finacially secure etc etc) and used different graphics and fonts to make it visually appealing and then stuck it at the front of my planner so I could be reminded every day. 

I used the snowball method and paid off the small loans from friends and family first while paying the minimum for the others and saving a small emergency fund. It gave me a good psychological boost to get those paid off first and definitely made me feel like I could continue on with the rest of them.

I hit a snag when I was given a permanent job (had been a temp) and went from weekly paychecks to monthly. I didn't realise how encouraging and motivating seeing weekly improvements in my finacial situation was to me and I started getting worse at keeping on top of my budget and spending habits. I managed to get it together after a few months but it put me back a little. I also used my credit cards a few times when I shouldn't have but always got back on the bandwagon and kept going. I defintely found it hard at times, especially when I realised I would be stuck working in crappy jobs until I could get debt free and go back to university. 4 years seems like a long long time to a 24 year old. 

I've been working hard over the past 2 years to get rid of all my debt. I had aproximately $7,000 left a few months ago when my parents suprised me by saying they would love to gift me the rest of the money to pay off my debt. They had sold their home (we have a huge housing boom currently and they sold at the top) and had bought a new house in a different region for way cheaper and still had a lot left to pay off all their debt, put a nest egg away, go travelling and help my brother and I. We've never had much money so I think they were really happy to be able to help us out. I cried when they told me, and then again when they actually gave me the money. It's such a relief to realise I can do whatever I want now and not be tied down by that big weight on my shoulders. 

I know I would have got there without their help, I was working hard and moving forward but it was a hard road at times and I am so grateful to my incredible parents. 

So thanks for all your help and encouragement (even when you didn't know you were giving it).",finance,1448831852
personalfinance,Present Value needed for Loan Comparison?,"Hi PF experts. I've been asked to run a comparison for a family member on a lump sum payment against two different loans they have. One is a mortgage (with a PMI payment) and the other is a student loan. Once I ran the impact of the lump sum against each, I determined the savings of paying off the loan early for each. Since the loans end at different times/years, I ran the PV of each of the savings to try and normalize. Is this the correct methodology? 

Side notes; 
The mortgage is of course longer terms, the student loan has a higher interest rate. 

For the mortgage, I ran the PV of the PMI savings separate from the actual mortgage savings. 

I understand the snowball and avalanche methods, but the family member doesn't need these methods as they are very diligent financially. I am not making the assumption that if they paid off the student loan first, that they would then take the payment they were attributing to this loan and put it towards the mortgage. They have confirmed this is is correct. They expect they will have a kid soon and will use the money for the kid.",finance,1448832554

personalfinance,In need of your budgetary wisdom (can),"hey everyone, 

i have been lurking for a while in r//personal finance and find you guys amazing. if you have time i would love your opinion on where to go with my finances. Im at a particular cross road right now.  i have the potential to be debt free very shortly and would like your advice on: 

a. debt repayment plan ( which debt first and should i do the snowball or save at the same time as paying debt? 

b. upon the debt paid what should i do with the money ( ideas for savings, higher mortgage payment? ) 

so let me know what you would do. 

Here is a little about me. i get paid around 90,000$ a year. I am working for a canadian company with very good job stability, good health and dental and offers an indexed pension after 30 years (60% of salary) or 35 years (70%). 
After Taxes &amp; pension contribution taken away  i get about 2100$ every two weeks. when tax season comes i always have a good chunk back ( min 3000$) because me and the wife pay extra tax each paycheck.

My wife, also an employee in the same company with the same benefits as me and earns 1400$ every two weeks. she is responsible to pay municipal taxes, bills, clothes groceries, house renos, trip money and saving funds for ex christmas, restaurant or trips. basically she is the saving queen. 

here is my budget 

net salary every two weeks is 2100$

my current expenses: 

a. mortgage 650$ (250,000$ still owed interest rate 3% ( life andmortgage insurance included) 

b. house and auto insurance 75$

c. car payment 220$ 

d. RRSP 50$ RRSP = Registered retirement savings plan) ( this is extra pension stuff i pay just in case) 

e. TFSA 50$ (Tax Free Savings Account) 

f. furniture loan 125$ (1000$ left to pay ) 

g. bank fees 10$

h. gas and parking 120$

i.car fund 50$ (for repairs, tire oil change)

total expenses 1350
left with 750$ that can be spent every paycheck. 

Debt 

house : 250,000$ at 3% interest (payment is 650 every two weeks
credit card : 1300$ ( should be paid in the next 2 paychecks... is higher then usual due to new tires and repairs on second car) (10%interest)
car: 6,000$ (reimbursed at 440 a month ) ( 6000$ left on car payment... hoping to get it done soon). 0% apr
furniture: 1000$ (reimbursed at 250$ per month) its at the end of the payment schedule. 0% apr

savings 
basically nothing in my main account ( trying to pay my visa) 
TFSA is currently at 1500$ (i started paying this year. the max allowed by law is 10000$ a year soon to go maybe to 5000$ due to new government) not sure if this should become my emergency fund ... would make sense but not sure. 
RRSP: about 12,000$ 


future expenses : 
4mo daughter will go to kidergarden in september at a cost of 150$ per week (300$ every two weeks) and estimated province of Quebec will reimburse 9$ a day ( will only claim this at the end of the year so it may represent a  2,000$ paycheck extra at the end during tax season). this expense will be there for 4 years. 

so here it is... i would like to know what you guys would do ... 

-  what would be your debt repayment plan ( which debt first and should i do the snowball or save at the same time as paying debt? )

- upon  the debt paid what should i do with the money ( ideas for savings, higher mortgage payment? car savings fund. )

i have this beautiful situation but i am not sure how i can balance a budget with saving, debt repayment and preparation for any eventuality. i know all this is possible if only i remain disciplined with my spending which i think i can maintain but it may be hard at times. hence maybe i shoul dalso plan for my mistakes ? lol

personalfinance,"Soon to inherit about $60k (pre-tax) which includes the sales of my grandparents home, which includes a 1br/ba apartment on the property. Seeking advice on buying the home as an investment.","Hi all!

Sorry about the terrible title! &gt;.&lt;

I have read up online and am reaching out anywhere that I can for advice on my current situation that needs an answer sooner than later do to current offers on the property, and running costs of holding the property. I will try to explain the situation as concisely as possible.
 
I am set to receive about $60k in pre-tax inheritance. Of my grandparent’s assets that make up the inheritance, their home has been appraised at just under $170k. The home is located in Merced, CA, hence the low property value. The property is located in a mature, blue collar neighborhood. The lot size is 10,000+ SF and larger than most lots on the street due to an alley way that used to exist decades ago. There is a 1,300 SF cottage home (main house) which has been very well maintained, with some updates including a master bath add on 20 years ago. The large yard (my grandmas pride and joy) is fully landscaped and in amazing condition (garden tour worthy) and there is a 13’x16’ windowed garden house in the back yard. 

The kicker on the property, and the reason I am considering purchasing it from the trust is this. The property includes a 1br/1ba granny unit with a full kitchen. So there is potential for two sources of rental income on the property. One caveat, the two units are on the same utility line.


At almost 30, my current financial status is as follows:

Income/Assets

- $90,000+ per year income (Work in Banking)  
- Inheriting about $40k (post tax)  
- $25k retirement  
- Only about $3,500 in savings  
- Job is seemingly secure and salary is increasing  
- 750 Credit Score   
- Not married (Long term girlfriend) / no children  


Debt/Liabilities
-  $8,500 CC Debt (6.5% interest rate)  
-  $4,500 Used car Loan (5.5% interest rate) 
-  $39,000 Student Loans  
-  $1,000/month rent/utilities (Bay Area)  


My thoughts: 

- Originally, I intended to use the $$ to pay down my debt, starting with the car loan and credit card, then chunk down a majority of my student loans, and put $2 or $3k in savings. But then I saw the appraisal for the home, and thought, “Hmm… I might be able to swing that”.  

- I don’t currently have enough for a significant down payment, but my Dad has expressed the willingness to lend me the money for the down payment which I would then pay back with the receipt of my inheritance.

- Based on current rentals available in the surrounding area, I estimate that I could receive about $1,100 - $1,200/month for the main home and around $500 to $600 for the second unit, totaling a conservative $1,600/month in income. According to http://usmortgagecalculator.org/, if I put 20% down, my monthly costs, including mortgage/property taxes/homeowners insurance would be around $900/month. Gross profit $700. Seems like a solid deal.

- Merced, CA has lagged very far behind much of California as far as property values go, but there is the growing UC Merced (Currently UC Merced students renting the extra unit), and the simple fact that people are being forced from the Bay Area and deeper and deeper into the Central Valley. Regardless, I would consider this a long term hold.

personalfinance,Setting myself up for financial stability without greatly constraining my lifestyle,"Some background: I'm 24 and I work as a cook in a nice restaurant. I've recently been promoted to a position with a higher hourly wage and a share of revenue from private events. I take home $600-$900 a week depending on hours worked and volume of private events. My rent is $600 a month plus ~$50 for utilities. I owe about $30,000 in student loans with an average interest rate of about 5%. I have two loan payments, one is $200 quarterly, and the other is $300 monthly. My parents recently put a good chunk of money towards the second loan, and it is currently payed ahead until June. Right now I'm making a $100 a month payment to keep interest from building up on that loan. Th e way things are going, I'm able to save about $800 a month, and I currently have $850 in savings. 

In theory I could save more, but my schedule makes this hard for me. I work 60-70 hours a week, usually 2-11pm or 11am-11pm. Because I work nights, my social life is pretty much all after work, and that means bars. I honestly spend a LOT of money at bars and restaurants. Once I week my girlfriend and I usually go out for a nice dinner which can be pretty expensive. The thing is, work is hard and stressful, and this gives me something to look forward to. It may be irresponsible but it feels like it's kind of important for my sanity. The major thing that I'm trying to cut down on is taxis/Uber. That can really add up when going home from bars and whatnot. Besides the above I have almost no expenses, spending so much time in the restaurant means that I eat most of my meals for free, so I hardly ever buy groceries. 

My main goal is to establish a fund for unexpected expenses, for occasional travel, and eventually to be able to move without causing real financial hardship. I don't see myself wanting to buy a car or a house in the next five years.

One of my questions is at what point do I stop saving and start putting excess money towards my student loans? What's a reasonable goal here?

Another consideration is that my take home pay is unusually high for a cook. The pay is good when you get to the executive chef level, but I'm still probably five years off from that. If I take a new job to move forward in my career, I may end up making significantly less. Is the answer to save more to make this easier? Or to try to pay down loans as much as possible now?

Overall, is my approach reasonable? Any advice is much appreciated!",finance,1448863028

I'm in NSW, Australia. 22 years old, no student loan, didn't go college, finished high school. Just been working. No car, no debts. Still live with my parents and don't pay rent, but help out with groceries once in a while...

Please advise on what I should do? Thank you in advance.

here is the issue:
my mom is in quite a financial mess. She owes the IRS approx $100,000... and she owes the State of California approx $7,500. She got her into this mess by not paying taxes for quite a few years starting around 2005. The IRS has ordered both of her jobs to change her claiming status to claim ZERO dependents, and from the few details she has told me, the State of California is taking a large percentage from both of her paychecks. (she works at 2 different hospitals).. She is making payments to the IRS for her federal debt, but she can't survive like this. She works 6 days per week, 12 hours per day... and is barely getting by. She is 64 years old and I don't know how much longer she can keep living like this.
I should note that she has filed bankruptcy twice before. Once in 1990, and then again in the early 2000s.

personalfinance,How do I start working off these large debts with little money?,"Hey guys, read the FAQ, but I still felt I could use some of the advice from experienced users on this subreddit.

Here's the breakdown: I'm earning as little as $750 some months, while I might earn as much as $1800 other months, due to owning my own business/self-employment contracting. I made a stupid decision, took out some credit card debt, and even worse, never put away money to pay the IRS. I've started getting threatening letters from multiple companies by way of certified mail. Here's what it looks like:

**Debts**

* IRS: $1300 from 2013 (will go up once I file 2015's taxes, not sure what the interest rate is on this)
* Synchrony Bank: $1000 @ almost a 26% interest rate.
* PayPal Credit: $963 @ 19.99% interest rate.

**Income**

* Revenue from writing for clients: anywhere from $500 - $2000

**Expenses**

* $60/mo - Phone bill
* $25/mo - IRS
* Synchrony Bank - $50/mo
* $20 fee every time I deposit a check from Canada
* $200 - $300 a month in groceries 

There are some additional expenses here or there. Sometimes when I borrow a car (I don't have my own), I'll throw in some extra gas, even fill it up at other times. Then there're some other little one-off things, like $5 here, or $2 there, and so on. Another thing that might be important: I'm going to be taking classes online, starting in January again - should have a year until graduation.

Anyway, can I just get some advice on how to work through this mess. I feel like I've already screwed myself over at 21 - being able to talk through how to handle this would be really helpful to me.",finance,1448890705

I am older, wiser, and poorer. Yet, I want to go back to school and get a degree in either Nursing or something in the computer field.

I have around $60,000 in federal loan debt, and another $3,000 that I still owe my old university. I am not current on these debts, I have ignored them mostly out of hopelessness and depression but I have made a few payments recently.

Right now I make around $400/week, in the process of getting a second job.

I feel completely hopeless about the situation, and I really want to be self reliant. It seems like the only way I can do this is to get back into school. When I think about the task, I am literally in tears because it just seems like such a mess.

Am I kidding myself at this point? Will I be able to go deeper into debt for the sake of a valuable degree?

personalfinance,Debt Predicament,"I have a loan situation/predicament.  My wife and I are both active duty.  We have steady income good jobs but monthly obligations with debts is making pay off slow.  

We have the opportunity to refinance at a lower interest rate.  Stats:

home value-$600kish 
VA loan current pay off-482k at 3.75% interest 
Revolving Debt-$35k
Monthly Income- $10k 

We can refinance at 3.25% interest but the VA cash out refinance obviously would have a funding fee for 3.3%.  

Essentially we are taking out 35k and paying 17k to do so, which is bad.  We are also behind on retirement savings.  Currently my 35 year old wife has $15k in her Roth tsp and she makes about $70k.  I have about $20k and I am 29.  I can't elaborate too much, but we are both in a very predictable scenario where we will get a pension from the military after 14 more years.  The only way this doesn't happen is some sort of freak accident.  How does a pension affect the amount you should be saving for retirement?  

My question is do we borrow more from the house and put it as catch up in a retirement account?  From what I understand, the money would essentially be tax free.  So we could make the funding fee be a much less significant percentage of the borrowed amount.  We could likely get $95k and maintain our same monthly payment or pay $100 more per month.  the extra 60k could go into a retirement account.

The debt is from a wedding, honeymoon, and home reno.  Our financial situation is stable, but we want this debt eliminated for psychological reasons.  We are not willing to move, and we will be refinancing, so I wanted to see what makes more sense.  

Do we borrow more and use it as catch up on retirement/establish emergency fund?  Or do we take the hit at a 50% fee and call this a bad mistake.  It seems like over a period of 30 years in an index fund, we could more than erase the financial consequences of this decision.

personalfinance,21 (M) Need to take charge of my finances,"Hi r/personalfinance! 

I have lurked on this subreddit for a long time and have gained some great advice along the way. I am a 21 year old Male living in Eastern Ontario, Canada that needs some advice/help budgeting. I have been in debt for about the past 3-4 years of my life and don't seem to be gaining any traction or making any progress. The debt and amount I owe seems to be climbing and it is causing a huge negative effect on my mental health and causing me to be unhappy. I want to make a goal to be debt free in the future and not spend my 20s poor and working all the time.

My current list of bills per month are as follows:


* Auto loan - 160
* Insurance - 150
* Internet - 45
* Cable - 60
* Phone bill - 65
* Gas - 240
* Gym membership - 15
* Fun - 100 (money spent going out, dates etc.)
* School 1 - 40
* School 2 - 180
* Friend loan - 150
* Savings - 100

-------------------------------------------------

I live at home so besides not paying for food, I only ever purchase meals when out on dates. Every paycheque I deposit 50 dollars into my TFSA but I have been dipping into that account a lot lately. I don't pay to stay at home to live with my parents so I pay for the cable for them to use as a thank you and the Internet for myself (I'm the only one that uses it)

I recently signed an auto loan for my mid 2000s sedan. It's a V6 and takes up quite a bit of gas. It is a necessity to get around based on where I live and I got it for a great deal. The only thing that worries me is the cost of gas and maintenance. I don't have enough in my savings account to last me in case something goes wrong and both my credit cards are maxed out. The harsh Canadian winters are approaching and I do not have the funds to cover winter tires or to rust proof the vehicle. The interest rate on it was absurdly low (2.99%) and the loan was only 4500. I have until December 2017 to pay the entire car off with 80 coming out of my bank account weekly. 

Besides the monthly bills, my accounts and debts are as follows:

* Chequing:0.00
* TFSA:50.00
* Mastercard: 4400/4400 at 19.99%APR
* Visa : 2487.75/2500 at 19.99%APR
* Store credit card: 251.27/2000 at 19.99%APR
* Private loan from friend: 1000/3700
* School 1: 2741.12  at 10% interest annually 
* School 2: 2,148.09 at 10% interest annually 

I messed up during my first few years in post-secondary and jumped from one university to another and still owe tuition towards both. Needless to say it was a huge financial mistake and I'm currently paying for it while attending a (much cheaper) college that specializes in a more interesting and financially viable (computer science).

&amp;nbsp;


As for the private loan, my friend loaned me some money that I needed in an emergency and have been very grateful. He is currently travelling overseas and I have been paying him back slowly over time. Although the last time I had spare money to send was back in August 2015 I hope to have this debt completely paid off before his return in August 2016. 

&amp;nbsp;

My source of income relies mainly on my part time job. I make about 13/hr and average about 20 to 30 hours a week (biweekly 500-600). The hours are not guaranteed and have picked up since it is the holiday season. 

&amp;nbsp;

I do have the opportunity to pick up additional security shifts at a separate job, but the problem relies on the timing (only offer 12 hour shifts, overnight or during the say). With school and my other retail job, it's difficult to find times to work.

personalfinance,"Divorcing - Trying to value a ""cash now"" premium to present to spouse and looking for input.","I'm hoping someone can help provide a non-arbitraty rule of thumb for appling a value to access to cash today vs. future access.  Specifically, I am in the process of divorcing.  I have a Canadian Federal pension to which my spouse is entitled a percentage (Approx. just north of $135K).  

I can elect to transfer that amount to her which, by law, must be invested into a Locked-In retirement savings account.  She can then invest it in whatever she wants, but she cannot withdraw any money until she retires (age 55 - about 20 years from now).  Even then, she cannot bulk withdraw money, it has to be metered out based on a formula that depletes the account over time.

On the other hand, we can negotiate and I can keep the pension money in my account and give up other assets.  In my case, that would be a large part of my equity in our house (approx. $250K in equity).

My lawyer has let me know if I go that route, I'm allowed to deduct taxes from the pensionable amount transfered, which based on an actuary would be about 23%, leaving her with a maximum cash-now value of about $100K.

My question is that I feel there should be some percentage I can apply to further reduce it based on her having full access to the ""money"" from day one, in it's entirety, with no strings attached vs. having it locked in an untouchable account that she can never bulk withdraw from.  I'm trying to be fair about it, but I really think there should be a premium paid to have that immediate access.

To be clear, I don't have to do this.  I can unilaterally decide to transfer the pension to her, which would force her to agree to selling the house and splitting the equity, but the neighborhood is great for the kids and I'd rather not do that.

So, thoughts or opinions?  I'm thinking 10% of the total (so, about $13,500 - in other words giving her approx. $87K) is reasonable, or is that too much/not enough.

finance,Taxi Medallion Bubble is different than Housing Bubble,"Here is the story I have friends who own taxi medallions in Chicago. Many of them bought their medallions at the time of right when the housing bubble about to burst in the country (U.S)(2007,2008,2009). The interesting parts of the idea of buying medallions were it was easy to finance or take a loan from the big banks and many other institutional investors without making or any down payments. As we all know what is happening in the life cycle of taxi industry and many other transportation businesses in general (Uber, Lyft effect), the big challenge is coming down to the people who bought medallions, and as well as who helped them to buy it. The price of medallions dropped down drastically which is a high risk for investors and individuals who own it. 
     
   The edge of the story is that in one side there are individuals who bought the medallions using investor’s money for the sake of gaining some value at the future date. On the other side, there are investors who lend money looking to gain, make profits on interest rates that they lend out the initial investment (start-up money)( again I don’t know the other interests of lending for medallions).
     
   Now the real headache is that the borrower (individual medallion owners) are struggling to pay off their debt (borrowed money from banks) or they still have payments to make for the next X amount of years while the price of the medallions are not worth that much after all.
    
    I think this scenario is very close to the scenario we had in 2008. Where the housing bubble; at first price moved upward, lack of bank’s credit check, lack of pricing model, unbalanced income levels and so on. The relationship to the medallion owners is the same; they thought buying a medallion is a good investment for the future, they made enough money at the time of buying it but not now,  the prices of the medallions dropped down a lot, and no buyers at the market at this time, and many other similar reasons. And its looks like a Medallion bubble to me (what do you say?). 
    
      Yes, it may not effect to every one of us, but if you or someone you know invested using institutional investors just don’t forget to check their portfolio and understand for what they have invested. If there were any investments made related to any sort of transportation, yes I say one more time transportation industry, please be on it and get rid of off it. Oh maybe it’s late for some of you, but many other’s this is a time to make changes. 
    
     Finally, the reason I am bothering to write about it, is that let us brainstorm little bit(find solution), it may be helpful to someone who is having down time. I have put some questions, and encourage everyone (professors, lawyers, students, investors, individuals, taxi drivers, uber drivers, dogs, cats…everyone) to write their thoughts related to this matter. 

      What is the best scenario in the place of medallion owner? (Yes they are going to drive for Uber)
      What should lenders have to do in order to get their money back? (The money the lend to borrowers)
       Is government, city, banks, SEC or anyone who has the authority to make changes will involve in the scenario?
       If either party's of the agreement (borrowers vs. lenders) have thoughts about default, who should start first? And what are the costs/benefits?
        And ask you to participate, write questions/answers.
