personalfinance,Want to maximize my TSP earnings.,"Hey all just looking for some help. Really wanna get serious with my TSP and retirement. I'm 25 and have been working for the government for 2 1/2 years. I have a TSP which I currently am putting 10% of my salary into. I haven't paid too much attention to it since I got the job but currently sitting with ~18k in it.

 I have my investment funds in the L 2050. Would it be wise to switch up my plan or stick to the 2050? I've heard from co workers that Funds C, S, and I are great ones to be in. 

I am also thinking once my my car is paid off in a few months of opening up a ""FEDERAL ROTH TSP PLAN"" I can probably contribute about 2k a year into it. Is it worth it or should I just add more to my TSP?

I currently have $71,000 in remaining student loan debt; it covers the rest of undergrad and grad school (down from about $140,000).

I'm 27, have a car fully paid off, have no rent or mortgage expenses, 820 credit score, $30,000 in a 401k, $70,000 cash in the bank, and make $90,000 a year.  Is there any reason at all to not just write a check for $70,000 and be done with it entirely?  I'm actually serious, I've been making decent monthly payments but I've just been stockpiling the cash in a savings account and today it hit me that I have no idea why I'm doing that.  The $71k in loans is 3 federal and 1 private loan around 6.5% interest a piece.  I know nothing about investing in stock markets so I feel like making a guaranteed 6.5% from paying it off is better than trying to make money investing the cash.  Does this make sense?

personalfinance,Is a loan to consolidate my debt a smart move?,"Hello all,

I'm sure this is a fairly common question, and I was able to gain a bit of insight from searching past posts, but I was hoping to get a bit of feedback on my specific scenario.

Essentially, I'm carrying debt on four credit cards. Since I know people will ask, this is mostly the result of reckless spending several years back and I've just been lugging the interest around while trying to stay afloat. I've since learned to live within (below, really, considering monthly payments) my means.

Under the circumstances, it seems smart to me to consolidate my debts into one loan that's easier to manage.

I checked my rate with Upstart, and received a $15,500 offer, 36 months at 10.22% (this is broken down as 6.72% + $775 origination fee). I checked that there are no prepayment penalties, and any extra payments go directly toward the principle.

My current balances and interest rates (these are my only debts):

$8,600 29.99%

$2,700 17.99%

$2,000 19.99%

$1,500 18.99%

My FICO credit score is somewhere north of 650.

I recognize that the biggest issue here would be the potential to rack up more debt on the cards, but I've steered clear of using them at all for the last year or so. I'm confident that I could avoid it, barring some sort of unavoidable catastrophe.

I'd love some feedback from those who are a bit more math and finance savvy than I am. Is there a loophole here that I'm missing? Has anyone worked with Upstart personally? They're very highly reviewed on CreditKarma.

Thanks, everyone. I appreciate it!

gaming,I'm Sick of EA,"I haven't had any bad experiences with EA, until recently. I thought they were a decent company and people were just overreacting.

I got Battlefield 3 over a year ago through the 'On the House' deals that Origin has. I have purchased a few games from EA including Battlefield 4, and I want to purchase Star Wars Battlefront, however I am reluctant after what happened to me recently with Battlefield 3.

Anyway, I'll get to the point. I've had Battlefield 3 for over a year, I've put almost 200 hours on the game (which might not seem like a lot but I don't have much time to play games as I'm a student). Recently it stopped working, as soon as I launch the game from the Battlelog web plugin, the game won't start and it says it won't activate. I tried logging in over the course of 3 weeks since it said the servers might be down, no luck. I deleted the game and reinstalled it, reloaded my games on Origin, tried repairing the game, again no luck. Being fed up that I couldn't play one of my favorite games with my friends, I decided to call EA.

Upon filling out the form and waiting for the call, I received the call within a minute or so. The man on the phone sounded like he was from a country I've never been to, I'll just leave it at that. He asked a bunch of questions that literally have no regard to fixing the game, as I know a thing or two about software and even more about hardware. He asked me to hold for 2 minutes, and I politely accepted. He put me on hold for 10 minutes, then just hung up and left me with a broken game.

I was reluctant to call back based on what others say about EA and I was pretty sure the same thing would happen again. I don't know who to go to get my game fixed and I've exhausted all I know to try and fix it. This seriously prevents me from buying anything else from Origin or from EA. I'm asking you guys for help because I don't know what to do anymore.

Here are my PC specs (probably not useful to anyone):
Intel Core i3 4170
AsRock B85M-ITX
AData Premier 16GB DDR3-1600
Seagate Momentus 500GB
XFX R9 290 Core Edition 4GB
Silverstone SFX 450W 80+ Bronze

I doubt posting my specs will help, but hey, worth a shot. Here is a link of the window it gives me when it tries to launch:

And here is what happens when I try to login to activate the game:

personalfinance,Borrowing money to invest with.,"Hi everyone, I am in a position where I can borrow €500 a month, that I don't need, with practically no interest. Would you advice to take this deal and put it in the stock market, or is that a big no-no? Thank you for your advice!

Edit: here is some more information. I live in the Netherlands, I study there and students can borrow money from the government with an interest rate of 0.01%. I have no experience with the stock market, but I know there exist low-risk funds that might be interesting. The thing is, like most of you said, it is possible to lose it all, and then you have a big problem. So that is why I asked for some advice here. The repayment schedule is basically: a percentage of your income with a minimum of +-€50 a month for a maximum of 35 years (or sooner if the debt is settled). First payment is 3 years after graduation and only if you make above minimum wage. It is possible to settle the entire loan or part of it without a penalty.",finance,1448982354

Quick background, I'm 25 years old (26 in January), I live in the Boston, MA area and graduated from college in 2013. I have been doing a pretty good job paying down my student loan debt and have already paid off a few of the highest interest loans in full. I have no debt other than student loans. I have a FICO score of about 775. These are the student loans I have left:
$27,000 private loan at 5.25% 15 years
$4,500 federal loan at 3.15% 10 years
$11,500 federal loan at 6.55% 10 years

I have about $40,000 in savings which I have been saving up for the down payment on a multi-family home. Property is very expensive where I currently live and will need at least $40,000 if not more for a 5% down payment and closing costs, fees, etc. I plan to live in one unit and rent the other(s) as an investment property. I also have roughly $11,000 in a Roth IRA that I don't plan on touching if I don't have to. I'm trying to max out my contributions every year.

Basically, I could be totally debt free within the next 6 months, but I would have no savings left to purchase an investment property. I'd have to start over and would probably take me another 2 years to save up back to where I am now. Is it better to pay off my loans first then save up again for the property, or purchase the property first then pay off the loans? Or is there a better way to go about it?

personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loans?,"*EDIT: so the answer is that I am an idiot. Refinancing is a much better option, paying less interest overall massively beats the credit benefits of having a long term loan, and apparently I can still get tax benefits on private student loans. So I'll start looking for better rates now. Thanks so much /r/personalfinance!


I've seen mixed information when trying to research this online and wanted to run it by y'all. 

I have three loans, each about 7k now. I pay $100/mo in each one, so they should be paid off in 8 years. They are unsubsidized Sallie Mae loans, 6.55%. 

I've heard that the interest is tax deductible, and that they are a good source of credit history. Plus, if any loan relief comes it would only benefit non private loans. 

However, I have a house and a car and their combined interest rates are less than these loans. So I don't need good credit for any major loans for a while now, but my credit is impacted by them adding to my debt to income ratio. 

Would it be better for me to refinance for a lower interest rate, or does having the interest rate be tax deductible plus having them give me a long loan history help me in ways that I'm not aware of?

A few side notes: I make too much to qualify for income based repayment, and my goal is to get rid of these loans asap.

personalfinance,"Loan Lesson Learned, the Hard Way","My older brother, younger sister, and myself all took out loans when we started college. My brother started back in 2005, I started in 2006, and my sister started in 2009. Some of these were student loans and others were parent plus loans. Fast forward to 2013, my dad calls me because his wages are garnished due to him not making payments on the parent plus loan. Turns out they were calling him for over a year but he never told us (sigh). I start managing the account and within a year get us back in ""good standing."" Today I get off the phone with fedloan after I did some math. The account has a total of 11 loans for the 3 of us. The total initial amount disbursed for all these loans is 87,575. The current principle balance on the account though is 118, 977.70. I'm no math wiz but these two numbers are not the same. That difference of 31,442.70 is all interest!!! The way it works is interest starts the day the loan is disbursed and doesn't end until it is paid off. So interest started back in 2005 and has been building on itself each year, for each loan since then. My family is paying for our ignorance and poor planning. As of right now, I can't fix it or make it go away but maybe someone will read this and not make the same mistakes we did.
Thanks for reading.

personalfinance,"Buying a house, starting a business - best use of debt?","Hello personal finance,
Long time lurker, would like to get a few opinions. I'm in a fairly stable financial situation - wanted to find out if there's a good way to go about my next life changing decision in consideration of low interest rates, tax deductions, etc.

Me: Age 33, Software Engineer with $110k+ salary at a big stable company. Been doing it for almost 10 years - not too worried about job.

Wife: Just graduated with PhD, no income, about to start a nationally reknown franchise business. The franchise business, we can assume the first year is break even with no profits, potential $100k+ profits once customer base is stable. She has $100k in liquid assets, no retirement funds. 

Us: Looking to have a child in the next year. 

My Assets: $120k in 401k, $50k in Roth IRA, Stocks $60k, $10k cash.

Debt: Car and mortgage. Car has $7k left and 1.5 years on the loan. House was bought 3 years ago, has $170k mortgage, 3.5% interest, probably worth $300k+ (appraisal last year says $280k, Zillow says $340k). No credit card debt, no school loans.


Situation: With my wife starting her business, we will be looking to move. Not only is my commute currently far, but we want to be embedded in the community she will be serving with her business. 

We'll need money for the business and money for the house. Her business, we can assume needs $100k. 
Although we have ~$120k equity in the current house, we would like to keep it as a rental. We bought it pretty close to the bottom of the housing market, and it's in desirable neighborhood. Of course we'll need to look at rental rates, etc to verify it will be profitable, but 99% sure it will be - so for now, assume selling the house is not on the table. 

Parents can gift us $100k if needed - I actually have a joint account with them, JTWROS status. Not sure how those joint accounts play into loans and mortgages. If I can say it's a gift or I just tell the bank that it's my money and no questions ask since my name appears on the statement.

The houses we are looking at will probably cost $400k-$450k. Would like to put at least 10% down.

Rather than burn through all our personal cash (if we assume her $100k for her business, I liquidate my stocks for the house down payment). I'm looking to see if there's a way to make best use of debt. What would be the best way to address the down payment and her business? Should we try to get a small business loan? Do a home equity loan on the current house? What of the money my parents are willing to give - best used for the house, or business (which one would ask less questions?). 

All this is going down in ~2 months.

personalfinance,"Buying a flat on my own in London, girlfriend to live with me - Advice?","I'm planning to buy a flat in London within the next 6 months, and my girlfriend will be living with me. We've been renting together already for 6 months, and have been together for a few years.

The reason why I will be the only person on the mortgage is because my income is a lot more than my girlfriends - which has meant I've been able to put money away over the last few years, whereas she hasn't been able to put anything away (hardly surprising when you're living and renting in London). I am looking to put a 25% deposit down on a £450k flat, which will make my mortgage payments around £1400-1500 depending on interest rates with specific lenders. I can afford the mortgage on my own and would not need to rely on her to subsidise it.

We plan to be together for the long term, and ideally we would buy somewhere together in a couple of years using money from the sale of this property, or buying another flat and renting out this one. But until she has been able to save up some savings for a deposit it's not practical at the moment. My plan is for her to live with me but I'm unsure of how she can contribute to the outgoings without legally being on the mortgage or contributing to the deposit etc.

Some places suggest the partner pays for utilities, some places suggest drawing up an agreement between us that means she would be paying rent to me on a monthly rolling contract - whatever happens though I'd like her to be paying less than what she would be spending on rent elsewhere, meaning she can start to put some money away, but still be contributing to the general running of the flat as is only fair.

I had considered that if she paid rent, and I used it towards the mortgage (say around £6k a year) we could write an agreement saying that this would be equity in the house, and that when it was eventually sold she would be entitled to that portion plus whatever increase in value it had accrued relative to the increase on the entire flat. Then she would have a good chunk of cash on return as opposed to wasting it on rent.

Alright so basically, everything was going fine with paying for college, until I recently got into an argument with my father about school, he wanted to come home every weekend from a university that was 150 miles away, I said I could not do that blah blah next thing you know, he tells me he has had enough of me and that he isn't going to help pay for college anymore.

With all that being said, I need help figuring out what my next move is. I am a second year in college, I am looking to graduate in 3 years which well definitely help alot with debt/this situation which I expected to happen.

I currently attend UC Santa Cruz (neuroscience major), which pretty much has the following payment breakdown per quarter (10 weeks):

Tuition and other fees: 			                     4,486.98
On campus living and meal plan:                           3,698.00  
Additonal misc/personal expenses:                          200.00
Total per quarter:                                                      8,384.98

I currently do have financial aid this year through FAFSA, but I do not know if I will be able to get it next year (because you need your parents tax info to get it).

But as of this year, the federal loan/grant breakdown is as follows:

Subsidizied Loan:                                          1,814.00
Unsubsidized Loan:                                         660.00
Federal Grant:                                                   816.00
Total per quarter:                                          3,290.00

So for this school year, there are 2 quarters left in the school year (unless I do summer school), I will owe 5,094.98 per quarter (minus the loans) which will give me a total of 10,189.96 for the remainder of this year (unless I do summer school then an additional 4,539.00 to that).

As for next year, I will attempt to find a place off campus (very difficult/expensive in Santa Cruz) which may alleviate my living/meal
expenses but also I won't have the loans/grants given to me by FAFSA.

That is not even the main issue though. The biggest problem is I have by December 17th to pay 3,641.98, and I would like to take out a private loan when I can, but a private loan requires a cosigner and I do not have anyone that can cosign it.

I really don't want to have to drop out of school, and I don't want to do. Any help/suggestions???",finance,1448989804

personalfinance,Is 8 exemptions too many?,"This year I had several life changing events, house, baby etc and now I need to reevaluate my exemptions. I used the w4 assistant tool over at paycheck city and based on that I found that I have 8 exemptions. Last year I only filed 2, myself and my fiance but now I can go up to 8. This is because I can claim myself, my single status, my 2 dependents, head of household, child tax credit, one for child care expenses and lastly one for deductions and adjustments (mortgage tax). 

My question is, just because I can take 8 exemptions should I? Currently, my federal tax is deduction is $418 or 16% of my gross bi-weekly paycheck which I feel is too high. If I use the paycheck city tool to calculate my 8 exemptions it reduces it to $179 or 7% of my gross bi-weekly paycheck.

I'm 28, maxing out my 401k.  In 2015, my stub will clock in at approximately 195k with a federal tax rate of ~22%.  I'm trying to get a sense of what ratio I should be contributing my 401k at for my age and income.  I expect to stay in a high earning field for the forseeable future and would expect my retirement bracket to be approximately the same.  What are others doing in this area?

personalfinance,Student loan clarification,"I'm starting to get all my student loan payments figured out, and I have some questions. Below is a summary of my student loans:



Loan Type | Loan Balance | Interest Rate
---------|------------|-------------
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $7,148.94 | 6.55%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $7,657.94 | 3.61%
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $2,999.00 | 4.41%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $4,607.51 | 4.41%

My first question is are my loans private or federal? From what I understand, a Stafford loan is a federal loan, but I know that I am going through Great Lakes which I think is a private company. Does that make my loans private? Whatever they are, what does that mean for me?

The next thing I am trying to figure out is whether or not to consolidate. From reading around on this sub it sounds to me like the only benefit to consolidation is ease of payment. I've read in a few threads that consolidation may end up raising my bottom-line amount that I end up paying. Is that generally correct? It seems that most people suggest paying the minimum for each, while aggressively focusing any extra money on the highest-rate loan. This definitely makes sense to me, but I'm wondering if this is the best route for my situation. (I realize that it's difficult to tell without a specific consolidated rate)

Other than that, if anyone has any pro-tips that I should be aware of for tackling student loans, I'd appreciate hearing them! I'm scouring this sub, but any advice helps!",finance,1448996138

economy,Help me understand CNN,"NOVEMBER 30, 2015 by Patrick Gillespie @ CNN MONEY: title: ""Fed ends 'too big to fail' lending to collapsing banks""
With comments from me, Joe Reader who had it with coffee for breakfast and found it all a bit hard to swallow. 

&gt;The Fed officially adopted a new rule Monday that limits its ability to lend emergency money to banks.

These are the same banks in the title? COLLAPSING banks you mean? This would imply that the Fed makes its own rules and this one merely 'limits' its ability to add digital zeros in a computer account of certain collapsing banks? 

&gt;In theory, the new rule should quash the notion that Wall Street banks are ""too big to fail."" Translation: the government has to save them during a crisis.

OK [*sigh*] so the Fed comes up with its own rules and 'theories' and please remind me who's 'notion' it was that these banks were too big to fail? The author continues with a translation for us idiots with some nutshell casual comment about our own gov. giving our money to banks? 

&gt;The Fed's new restrictions come from the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which brought in a wave of reforms after the financial crisis.

OMG REALLY? 2010 was only the second round of QE... What reforms exactly? AN ENTIRE WAVE of reforms no less... This is the same year [and I quote Wikipedia:] In November 2010, the Fed announced a second round of quantitative easing, buying $600 billion of Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011... 

&gt;Under the new rule, banks that are going bankrupt -- or appear to be going bankrupt -- can no longer receive emergency funds from the Fed under any circumstances.

Can you be more vague? The Fed decides what 'appears' to be going one way or the other? Aren't they the ones that control that? 

&gt;If the rule had been in place during the financial crisis, it would have prevented the Fed from lending to insurance giant AIG (AIG) and Bear Stearns, Fed chair Janet Yellen points out.

I don't THINK so Janet, there is NO 'rule' in place anywhere that prevents the Fed from doing ANYTHING. 

&gt;Politicians like Senator Elizabeth Warren have pushed the Fed to end such emergency lending to banks that are going under. She does not think the Fed's new rule goes far enough.
""There are still loopholes that the Fed could exploit to provide another back-door bailout to giant financial institutions,"" Warren, a Democrat, told CNNMoney.

NO KIDDING, yay Liz. OF course there is. Tell me again why we are lending money to any bank again? Much less, ones that are circling the bowl... 

&gt;At first glance, the new rule sounds like a common sense change. If a bank is going under, American taxpayers shouldn't be bailing it out.

At first glance, none of this bullshit makes any logical sense at all. American taxpayers are getting cold and hungry... I can think of 450 million of us that could really use a fraction of our fair share of that. Foriegn aid? that's another rant. 

&gt;However, it's important to note that the new rule allows the Fed to judge by its own measures whether a firm qualifies for its emergency aid. The idea is the Fed can still lend to banks during times of emergency, but the bank must be able to pay it back. Yet the true health of a bank in turmoil can be very difficult to assess.

Apparently, 'firms' qualify for all this money but we don't.... and yet, the supreme court decided that 'firms' essentially have the same rights under the constitution as us people. 

&gt;""It's very hard to judge in real time whether a firm is insolvent or just having liquidity problems because it becomes impossible to price assets,"" says Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, a research firm. That's why Warren wants clearer guidelines.
""It's up to Congress to close those loopholes and ensure that Fed emergency lending is limited to protecting the economy and not to saving a few favored banks,"" Warren says.

OH you mean that's what all that what they were doing? SAVING A FEW FAVORED BANKS??? WELL wasn't that nice of them, sure sounds like taxation without representation to me. 

&gt;The rule is the latest in a series of reforms the Fed has put on the biggest banks in an effort to prevent the next crisis.

That's not going to happen. They will not be able to prevent the next one. [or, they're engineering the whole thing] The little 'reforms' they are putting on their buddy banks are not going to amount to much. 

&gt;The Fed performs ""stress tests"" on banks to see how they perform in a mock financial crisis scenario. It's also forced banks to increase the amount of cash they have stashed away to weather the next rainy day.

The author makes it sound like another day in springtime... enough cash for a rainy day? You're kidding right? Think about food and heat... they can have ALL of their currency by then, think no computers, power goes out and you loose your digital zeros and all you have is a wad paper that only has the value of toilet paper.

&gt;The new rule can be seen as a warning sign from the Fed to big banks: don't expect another bailout next time. Yellen emphasizes that its emergency lending to banks is a last-resort option.
Yellen said the Fed ""has long had"" this lending authority, but it was only used ""sparingly"" and in ""severe financial crises.""

OR, whenever it damn well feels like it, Janet.",finance,1449000428

personalfinance,Co-signer bankruptcy ending - how to proceed?,"I have somewhat of an interesting situation with my private student loans. I was an idiot and took out loans for each of my first 3 years in school from 2008-2010. My parents co-signed my first two loans (roughly 11k each - Wells Fargo), and a family friend co-signed my third (~13k - Discover Student Loans), because unknown to me at the time, my parents had filed for bankruptcy. When I dropped out of college that year, I rued the day that my loans would go into repayment. I received my third year (Discover) notices of the loan going into repayment, and have paid the minimum since then. However, I didn't immediately get any notices from my Wells Fargo loans, so I kind of blew it off until I heard otherwise.

In 2012 I bought a house, but through the process, I saw negative credit activity from my Wells Fargo loans, not being paid for quite a while. I contacted Wells Fargo and they said that because the co-signers were in the midst of Chapter 13 (I think) Bankruptcy, they could not speak with me about the loan, provide notices of repayment, set up payment plans, etc. After much back and forth going up the chain with Wells Fargo, and getting the credit bureaus to not report it negatively until the bankruptcy ended, my credit report was cleared of that activity and I was able to buy a house. Throughout the process, I had to work on getting it off the credit report multiple times, and it has since come back on the report, albeit not in a negative light.

Sometime in the next few months, my parents are expected to end the bankruptcy period. Perhaps, you can help me proceed in the most fiscally responsible way. I'm not sure if interest has been accruing throughout this time, I'm not even sure of the interest rates on the loans. My credit report show the balance around the same 11k number I got the loan at. The Discover loan's interest rate is high. I'm not sure quite how high, but apparently I've paid over $7k on it in interest and $1k in principal over the last few years.

My debts are as follows:

* Wells Fargo student loans - ~$22k? I hope!
* Discover Student Loan- $11.5k 13% interest?
* Mortgage - $182k 3.75% interest (purchased for $192k 3 years ago, currently renting to tenants who pay almost the full mortgage payment, Property Manager/Realtor comps the house at around $250k as of a few months ago)
* Credit cards - ~$600 10% interest?
* Both our cars are paid off cash (worth around $7k together)

My contract for my current job just ended and my wife and I live with my mother and grandparents helping take care of them for a rent of around $500 a month including food. $100 cell phone bill and gas/maintenance is the only other expense I can think of. My wife clears about $1.8k/month.

All that being said, I've had interest from my tenants in buying my house. If I sell my house, it seems I should just take the profit and pay off all my student loans. If I can't sell my house right now, but continue to have a similar tenant situation, what kind of options look the best for me? Consolidating loans? Re-finance to pay the bad ones off? Would I have any luck offering smaller cash offers to pay off in one lump sum? Thanks in advance for any help!",finance,1449006233

I'm thinking of cashing out some government bonds I've been given over the years in order to fund the account, but I'd like some advice before I commit to that.

I have:

* 6 Series EE bonds at 4% interest. Original amounts were $50 on some, $100 on others. Lowest current value on a bond is $78, highest is $157. Final maturity on all of them will be reached in 2023.

I'm thinking of cashing out all of the Series EE bonds and leaving the Series I bond to reach final maturity since it's worth a lot relative to the other bonds and it's a safe investment. But would I be cheating myself out of better interest rates with a Roth IRA account? 

Also, I want to avoid paying taxes on the bonds twice -- once when I cash them out and again when I put the money into the Roth. But this is probably impossible, right? Maybe I should put them into a 401k instead if I go this route?

**The four valuation measurements falling into the inexpensive or fairly valued category are:**

Rule of 20: Stocks are considered fairly valued when the sum of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 forward P/E ratio and the year-over-year change in the consumer price index (CPI) is equal to 20 (or inexpensive when it’s below 20).

Fed Model: This model compares the S&amp;P 500’s earnings yield (which is the inverse of the P/E—or E/P) to the yield on long-term U.S. government bonds. Negative readings suggest favoring stocks over bonds.

Equity Risk Premiums: These subtract either the forward 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield or the forward Baa corporate bond yield from the forward S&amp;P 500’s earnings yield (E/P). Positive readings suggest stocks are undervalued relative to bonds.

Dividend Yield: Compares the current dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 with both historical averages and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. At near-equivalent yields, the market is seen as fairly valued.

**The seven valuation measurements falling into the expensive category are:**

Forward P/E: Probably the most common measurement, it divides the current S&amp;P 500 price by 12-month forward expected operating earnings. It’s presently slightly above its ~20-year median of 15.9.

Trailing P/E: Also a common measurement, it divides the current S&amp;P 500 price by 12-month trailing operating earnings. It’s presently comfortably above its ~25-year median of 17.8.

Five-Year Normalized P/E: This model uses four years of historical earnings, two quarters of forward earnings, and takes the midpoint between reported and operating earnings (it’s a take on Shiller’s CAPE, but with a shorter time span, and with an adjusted earnings calculation). It’s presently comfortably above its ~70-year median of 18.1.

Shiller’s Cyclically-Adjusted P/E (CAPE): This model uses an inflation-adjusted price for the S&amp;P 500 and divides by reported earnings over the prior 10 years. It’s presently comfortably above its ~135-year median of 16.

Price/book: Divides the current S&amp;P 500 price by the book value of its components. It’s presently slightly above its ~38-year norm of 2.4.

Tobin’s Q: Developed by Nobel Laureate James Tobin, it’s a fairly simple concept, but laborious to calculate (calculations are done by the U.S. government and the ratio’s readings are provided by the Fed). It’s often called the Q Ratio and is the total price of the U.S. stock market divided by the replacement cost of all its companies. A high Q (greater than .85) implies overvaluation.

Market Cap/GNP: Considered Warren Buffett’s “favorite valuation indicator,” the model is the ratio of total U.S. market capitalization to gross national product (GNP). It’s presently well above its ~65-year mean of 69%.

Caveats
Three of the valuation metrics above—one of which falls into the inexpensive category and two of which fall into the expensive category—deserve mention for important caveats to consider: Fed Model, Shiller’s CAPE and Market Cap/GNP.

Fed Model: Cornerstone Macro highlighted the problem with the Fed Model in a recent report on valuation. “For much of history, before the early 2000s, bond yields and earnings yields were within close range; making such a comparison an important branch in the asset-allocation decision tree. Since 2002, the gap has widened to historic highs, and has exposed the shortfalls of the model.”

“In mid-2002, the yield on the 10-year government bond fell below the yield on the S&amp;P 500. It has never crossed back since then. Thus, the Fed Model has told asset allocators for 12 straight years now to prefer stocks over bonds. That’s quite a long time to buy and hold stocks … especially while bonds have rallied so much over that time. This is one where you sometimes should fight the Fed [model].”

Shiller’s CAPE: In a version of this valuation analysis I published last May, I dissected the CAPE and the caveats which are crucial to consider.

Market Cap/GNP: As for Warren Buffett’s favorite valuation indicator, some caveats are also worth mentioning. As noted by Cornerstone, “this metric has huge weaknesses, such as not recognizing structural changes in a country’s financial system, productivity, tax policy, demographics, etc. … the list is long on why this metric isn’t useful for comparison over time.”",finance,1449022068

Unsubordinated - $8k (6.5%)
Subordinated - $20k   (6.5%)
GRAD PLUS - $25k     (7.5%)

Servicer is Great Lakes - is there any way they will budge on the rate if I simply complain and bitch? I probably look like a great borrower on paper and I don't know if there are any tips, tricks I should be aware of. 

Do I need to go higher up the ladder to the actual gov't? Or is SoFi the best bet?

I have recently had an unexpected sale of a domain that I bought a couple of months ago for around 13,000 to develop a site for but then sold for 45,000 a couple of weeks ago when someone decided they wanted it  - which was awesome until I calculated how much capital gains tax I was going to have to pay on the 32,000 - between federal and state taxes about 14,000 give or take. 

I'm not really an investor so I don't have any investment losses to write this off against. However, after the sale I did spend about 8,000 dollars on two new domain names that will replace the one I just sold. I read a few articles including this one that said you can do something called a 1031 exchange with domain names to defer the tax due. 

http://activerain.com/blogsview/548350/1031-exchange-of-internet-domain-names

Given that my actions seem to fit the criteria for such an exchange, and at 8,000 would reduce the tax bill by around 3,250 - would it be worth it - or would it be something that would cost me more to have executed than I would save? Is it something I can do myself? Is it even something that can be done retrospectively given that I have already made the purchase?

Or maybe someone just has a better recommend on what I should be doing to counterbalance this gain. For instance it occurred to me it might be an idea to buy high risk options with some of the profit from the sale- then sell in december if they are down, or sell in january if they are up (my rationale behind this is it seems with this tax liability I get to gamble on stocks for about a 40% discount on losses as the money would have gone to the government anyway).

Last thing - I did try searching the subreddit before I posted, but I find it hard to believe this problem is unique so I also would totally just appreciate someone pointing me to the almost identical reddit post from last week that all you regulars remember that I couldn't find despite the fact it's right in front of my face.

personalfinance,MD in desperate need of financial help!,"Hey guys,

I'm kinda new to all of this but I just want to start off by saying I'm brutal with finances so any advice would be great advice.

A little about myself:

I'm an MD about to start my fellowship in Vancouver, Canada.

I have a 200k line of credit - 130k of which is invested with Scotia McLeod and 70k of which I've used for medical school. The investments pay me $550 / month in dividends - which I use to pay my monthly interest rates. 

I don't have any other debts other than a car / insurance which is $300/month.  Assume I don't have much in savings either. I have great credit and always pay my bills on time. 

Based on an income of 67k Canadian / year and increasing by 5k every year for the next three years (after that I'll be independent and likely making more money) I have a few questions:

A) should I rent an apartment in Vancouver or should I buy? It's just myself - no dependents. If so, what sort of mortgage plans should I be aiming for? 
B) what other suggestions do you have on how I should manage my income in order to optimize my finances.

More information is available upon request. Any help is great help. Thanks in advance everyone.",finance,1449033461
personalfinance,When should I file a tax return?,"Hi All,

I'm a college student who has worked waiting tables and a summer internship. This year my only employment has been making $20/hr at a summer internship 40hrs a week for a few months. My father has been listing me as a dependent my whole life so I have not filed a tax return.

Additionally, I recently started a small business. It is classified as a partnership where me and another individual split the profits equally. I'm projecting our revenue to be around $60k this year (not sure about profit due to startup costs).

My question is what do I have to pay in taxes? Does the fact that I'm classified as a dependent have any impact on my income taxes? Federal and state income tax were not deducted from my paychecks at my internship and I have yet to pay anything but sales tax from my company earnings.

personalfinance,Great Lakes Student Loans: FYI splitting accounts for easier payments,"Hey guys,  in celebration of me paying down my third of six loans this morning (only $7k left total!) I wanted to share this tidbit with those who may have Great Lakes as their loan provider. 

Like many of you I had multiple loans from multiple years when I graduated,  however when it came time to pay up I saw that I only had one payment schedule and that they had grouped my loans for my billing convenience (not consolidation).  Hah!  Convenient for them. After a few months I wished to wipe out one loan that had a 6.8% rate but it was a nightmare trying to first, figure out what that amount would be and second, having to follow up repeatedly to make sure it was applied correctly.  Even now I'm still unsure of how that payment got applied. 

After inquiring about my options I discovered that you can request to split each loan into individual accounts. This will result in each loan have their own payment schedule and each can have their own automatic payments. This allows you to pay unique amounts to each loan whenever you want! None of this 'well yes the extra payment goes to the highest interest loan, but first you need to pay the accumulated interest on ALL your loans.'

Now when I log in I can see the three loans that are paid off (those with the highest interest rates I wanted to tackle first) and my remaining three loans of varying amounts which I want to hit from smallest to largest for the mental victories. Today I was able to send $800 at my largest remaining loan without having to fiddle with the other two or call in. Each loan is now easily tracked with its respective token number and total balance. It is also super easy to calculate the payoff amount when it finally comes time. 

However when you split each loan into different accounts each account has a minimum monthly payment of $50. Therefore if you have 10 loans grouped in one account and combined your minimum payment is right now $300, this might be problematic. These 10 loans at $50 a pop when split result in a combined monthly payment of $500. Therefore if you have many small amount loans this may result in an increased minimum monthly payment. Ask the rep to calculate what this is before you proceed so you have an idea. 

One way to avoid this is to group your loans by interest rate since (mathematically) it doesn't matter big vs small when the interest rates are the same. This way your 10 loans may be grouped into 3 groups, each with the same interest rate, but now there is only $150 minimum (though the $50 per account is a minimum and will be more if you have a large loan). 

Also if you split your loans and want to set up auto-pay you MUST have auto-pay enabled for all loans or none of them,  you can't selectively choose. 

Note though that when you ask to do this they will try very hard to convince you otherwise saying ""this is very abnormal"" and ""most people definitely do not want to do this"". Where this is coming from is that they make money on the interest and so enabling you to pay off your loans faster (especially the higher interest ones) is not in their best interest. So be ready to talk through it with them and stand firm. 

It took about 3 weeks from time of request to my new payment schedules being posted, during which this time I had to confirm separately three times that indeed this is what I wanted. I then had to reset my auto-pay but it's been much easier since. 

Sorry for the essay but I figured others may be interested in the process as well as the potential sticking points! It is possible they just don't advertise it at all as an option.",finance,1449035527

personalfinance,I want to re-finance my car loan to a higher rate. Tell me I'm not crazy.,"I currently owe about $10K at an interest rate of 0% (19 more payments at $523/month).  My bank (not my current lender) called me about re-financing (they somehow knew I had an auto loan).  They offered a 5-yr loan at 2% interest, with $199 in fees.

So I'll end up paying about $700 more with the new loan (fees and interest).  But in the meantime, I'll be putting $350 / month extra into the kids' college fund.  Assuming we get even a few percentage points of return on the money, we come out ahead, right?  Isn't the math as simple as this: if the returns on the college fund are greater than 2%, we should do this?

My motivations are that our oldest is 8, and college is not really that far off, and I feel behind on college savings.  This seems like a free way to put more into the college fund while there's a good amount of years to make tax-free returns.  I'm 90% convinced that this is a good move, but I'd like to hear some other opinions (and my wife is skeptical).

Thanks!

EDIT: Hadn't done the math before posting, just did it.  College fund comes out $300 ahead in the re-finance strategy, assuming 6% growth.  Assuming 4% growth, the two strategies are a wash.

I file S-0 at work so I always got tax refunds and my bi-weekly paychecks were usually taxed at 31% (KY taxes).

I'm married with a child, but my wife and our child are under her insurance (she's a teacher, state insurance). Because of the change and the ACA, my monthly health insurance contribution goes from $220 a month to $560 a month. Therefore, I'm opting out to join my wife's health insurance.
   
I'm allowed to do this because my company contributes less than 50% to the premium cost, which means I contribute more than 50% and am therefore eligible for my wife's insurance. The problem lies with open enrollment. 

My wife's school district open enrollment is in July (7 months away). Does my company changing insurance companies qualify as a ""significant change"" so as to hop on my wife's insurance outside of open enrollment, or do I need to take my work's coverage for 7 months?

I talked to my HR department, but they suck and want me to take the company's insurance that they're providing, saying that if the cost is an issue, take one of the lower plans (no hospitalization covered, etc.). 
If I don't qualify for open enrollment exemption, is it worth it to take a lower plan and stay in a bubble for 7 month? If I don't take the insurance at all, it's close to a $700 penalty.

personalfinance,"Recent college grad working first job, how to best prepare for now, and the future?","Thanks for taking the time to hopefully answer my questions. 

So, a rundown of my current financial/life status: 

* Education status: Graduated college last Spring with a B.S. degree from a state university. Thanks to a combination of scholarships, work benefits, and generous parents, I have never had to take out a student loan or any kind of loan up to this point. This also means I have no credit history (never had a credit card).

* Employment: Currently working at an engineering firm in a technical position. Started approximately 5 months ago and have been working full time ever since. Current salary is 47k, but I'm hoping to get that up after I've been with the company for a while.


* My housing costs eat up by far, the largest percent of my income. While Boston is a great city to live near, it's also one of the more expensive housing markets in the US. I currently live in a shared house. 
My monthly rent and utilities bill is approximately ~38% of my take home pay  ($1,000/mo + utilities (~$50 / mo)

* Tax status:  23% of my gross pay in federal and state deductions. No dependents or anything like that, so I'm not sure what kind of refund I can expect come tax season. Any info here would surely be appreciated. 

* 401K Contribution: Currently allocating 6% of gross pay to a 401K which will have a 50% employer match after becoming fully vested. I only was eligible to enroll quite recently, so I only have a few contributions so far. 

* Living Expenses: I currently don't have easy access to a grocery store, so I've been getting a lot of prepared meals and like to eat out somewhat frequently. While this isn't entirely cost effective, due to my work schedule, I also don't have limitless hours to prepare meals, so the convenience factor is a plus here.  I currently don't have a car, so no expenses there. I get around via a combination of public transportation (pass paid for by work), or Uber/Lyft when necessary. 

* Insurance: Currently still on parents health insurance. My job offers health insurance, but I don't need it until I'm ineligible for my parents plan. 

* Other assets: I've dabbled with stocks (Robinhood) with generally bad results so far. My losses haven't been financially devastating, but before I attempt to invest in riskier asset classes I would like to have a better plan in mind. Don't really have any cash-savings right now, I was more or less broke my senior year so I'm more or less starting from scratch. Everything goes right into a checking account that is used for all purchases.

* Money wasters: I don't gamble or smoke, but like to drink and be social, and with so many great bars, it's hard not to. I never go too wild of course, but it can definitely add up over time. 


**So, my main questions given my circumstances are,**

* What would be the smartest thing to do with the remaining income I have? How much is it important to save a month? 

* Should I start trying to establish and build credit? Would it make sense to pay for everyday purchases (currently put on a debit card) with a credit card instead? I would ideally never carry a balance on said card and pay it off in full each month. 

* What would you do in my situation regarding *saving/investing* vs *living* ? How much should I be worried about my future *right now*?

Im searching through all the rules and links
and need help fast before he signs up for Prosper pr lending club
P2p lending.

My gut feeling (as i had with him signing up for credit cards)
you can see my last post i must not have followed the rules because it was not commented on.

Im sorry I'm trying to keep him from making a bad decision.

his barclays card 1 of 5 other cards
the barclays is 24% interest.

He wants to pay it down he pays 150.00 4,000
all in all we have 12 k debt.

he won't consider telling the credit card companies that he is now unemployed 
( he is a student but got laid off)

He thinks that in an emergency we will need that credit line.
I do not have time right now to post every cost we have because he's literally plugging in our info to different debt consolidation companies.

I told him this is a big decision its a legal agreement
I don't trust the peer to peer or debt consolidation companies.

My idea was to let all the credit card companies know we are unemployed and negotiated different interest rates, and get a break for 3 months no credit card payments. (we have GI bill to pay for school and rent till end of january)
 (he's a aviation contractor going to school for welding school ends in february so money should be coming in by then)


My idea is to go to the bank and get a loan from them only
not from a place on the internet 


Please help me even if it is just to copy and paste a link to me

I could tell you how we got into this mess but that is in a previous post

(he would have been sent on business trip where at the end of the month he reports all the money he spent on the travel the food and the hotel, then be reimbursed at the end of the next month into his bank account. Problem is he was offered cards from rental car/hotel/ 2 airlines/ and 2 hotels,
WE NEVER EVEN GOT THE POINTS=THE REASON HE SIGNED UP IN THE FIRST PLACE or the free complimentary plane tickets
we didn't register to get the points.

Anyways it went on the cards after he signed up for them, then the reimbursements were sent to his personal bank account where he did not use that to pay off the complete expenses on the card,


My husband is not a bad person this is my fault too, i feel guilty to even talk about our problems. IF he has a flaw at all or a spending problem it is because he came from a lower economic background and also wants to give us the moon and beyond and its is my fault for letting him. I also am the type of person that does not know what my spouse makes ( i found this out when filling out rental and mortgage applications over the years)

-I can give so much more details but for now-

personalfinance,Advice on student loan debt and cost of renting an apartment,"I'm just graduating college and I've racked up $70k in debt. The job I got will be paying me $80k. $30k of my debt is in private loans, which have interest rates between 6%-9.5%. The rest are in federal loans which are all less then 6% but some are fairly close to 6%. 

I'd like to live in an apartment that costs $1200/month. My parents are encouraging me to do it. On the other hand, this debt stresses me out and I'd like to pay it off as quickly as possible and it's possible to find a shared living situation for $600-$700. I believe with $80k I'll be making around $4200/month (not sure exactly how to compute this with tax, may be closer to $5k) , so it'd be enough to pay for rent and put at least a couple thousand on my loans. 

It still feels excessive to go for the more expensive place, but I'd be a lot happier as the place I live is very important to me as I've moved a lot since moving out of my parents house and I've lived in a lot of shared living situations. It'd be nice to live on my own in a peaceful place. Would help with stress too. 

Looking for advice from someone who has been through this/has a perspective.",finance,1449086544
personalfinance,Credit Card Consolidation help,"Good afternoon just seeking some advice.  I currently have around $14k in CC Debt and i'm looking to consolidate about 10k of it for a lower interest rate.  It looks like I can get in at around 7-11% for the 10k on a 48mo payment plan.  My question is, is this a good idea?  Here is my situation:

CC1-$5000 at 21.99%
CC2-$5000 at 13.99%
CC3-$3000 at 0% for next 11 Months.
CC4-$1000 at 0% for next 14 Months.

$1000 for mortgage
$400 for Groceries

Now I know I need to be tackling the debt and I'm trying but between the new house just getting married and just bad habits (eating out, buying new games, etc.) things are stacking up.  I think I can tackle all these and it's within my means but would getting the consolidation help alleviate me at all?  I know if would ease my mind eliminating a few of the cards that have had balances for a long time and getting rid of those higher interest ones seems in my mind like it would help.

investing,My thoughts on why the Fed will raise interest rates on Dec 16th. Correct me if I am wrong or add to the discussion!,"Inflation has been at the center of the discussion regarding whether the Fed will raise rates soon. Inflation, however, is one of many factors to consider in hiking interest rates. Personally, I think the Fed has been using it as a scapegoat to prevent a rate hike. Remember, one of the major reasons for ZIRP (and QE) was to recapitalize banks after the 08-09 crisis. This has been accomplished and banks are sitting on TONS of reserves, which the Federal Reserve is paying interest on (http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm). I think the idea is that the Fed wants to gradually raise rates to get banks to start lending out these excess reserves. However, if the Fed Funds rate is below the IOER rate, then banks have the incentive to keep excess reserves at the Fed and note to lend them out in the market (to other banks, etc). I wonder how this will pan out and if this is precisely why inflation has been so anemic: there is no incentive to lend out money in our economy with interest rates so low.",finance,1449088743

I know they way I'm paying down my debt right now will take far too long, and cost lots in interest. What would be the best action to take? I considered getting a loan to pay off my CC's and current loan. I've looked a prosper, since I can get good idea of the rates they'd give me on a soft pull, see below. I considered the 18k loan, 389 month, 13.01% APR, 60 months, but would that be too long at too high of APR? I'm only interested because I'd be significantly lowering my over all monthly payments.

This last pay period, I was paid roughly $45 less on my commission check and $30 or so on my paycheck than what I generally receive (every two weeks since March). I claimed the same tax number for federal and state tax, so my withholding should not have changed at all. Right?

When I called our new payroll company, the rep I spoke to said that sometimes different payroll companies use different tax engines to determine how much to withhold. She said if there was an error and they are withholding too much, that I'd at least get it back in my tax return. Big freaking deal, I have bills to pay **now**!

financialindependence,"Pension at 47, want to start a business, interested in your thoughts","Hello all!

I am a 23 year old male, married, and interested in starting a business in the near-ish future and wanting opinions. 

My finances are as follows:

-Currently 58K salary(~3k/month after taxes). Will increase to 
~103k by end of next year/beginning of 2017

-Wife makes ~1k/month after taxes

-40-48% savings rate currently depending on the month, not planning to increase expenses when I get raise

-Federal employee, extremely secure job

-$7,600 in TSP/Roth IRA

-$8,500 in Cash

-Only putting 5% into TSP right now to get full 5% match

But here is the kicker.. I am going to be eligible to retire at 47 with a pension equal to 39% of my top three earning years. I will also have the opportunity to work until 56(unless I get into management which will allow me to work longer) and get a 48% pension. 

This pension makes me really question focusing on extremely early retirement(think early 30s) when I can save what I am now or less and have a pension that is equal to what a lot of people's goal is for a SWR on top of my savings. 

The issue is that in the near future I would like to save up enough money to start a construction business on the side(building new homes to sell) and it takes money that I could be putting into my TSP and reallocates it to a savings account so that I can have it available to start the business. My father builds houses and is willing to help me get started by teaching me how to build and the profit margins are extremely high, so it is extremely tempting to put money towards this instead of in my TSP. 

I know that in the end it is a decision I need to make myself, but I would love to hear some opinions in case I am missing something, or at the very least talk about my options are. I know that I can save plenty to retire before I even qualify for my pension, but it is hard to do with that much guaranteed income is on the table for the rest of my life.

Thank you,

personalfinance,(UK) What do you think of taking funds out of Cash ISA to use against an OFFSET mortgage?,"Hi everyone,

Long time lurker in need of your advice:

To cut a long story short, I am planning to buy a 250k£ house with a 65% mortgage of 162.5k£.
I am currently renting after the earlier sale of a home and my cash is divided into the following pots: 50k£ = Premium Bonds, 20k£ = Cash ISA, 10k£ = Shares ISA, 10k£ = Stocks, 10k£ = Savings Account, 5k£ = Current Account.

My financial advisor has suggested an Offset Mortgage with an interest rate of 1.85%. In this case, upon closing all of the above accounts, I would start with just over 17.5k£ in the Offset account which would increase to about 30k£ within ~3months thus reducing the interest-generating portion of my mortgage to 145k£ and then to 132.5k£.

My question is this: should I really close the Cash ISA to do this?  Perhaps I should go the conventional route with a slightly higher LTV fixed rate mortgage?

Any thoughts or advice welcome!
Many thanks in advance.",finance,1449097728
personalfinance,How I get a guaranteed 15% return paying down my wife's student debt.,"My wife has 35k+ in student loans at a 5% interest rate.  She has been paying them off, at just above the minimum, by herself.  I have been hesitant to help her mostly because i can make a higher rate of return in my investments.  

However, I recently discovered how to make a 15% return on my money by paying down her debt.  It's simple -- I give her the money to pay down her debts that I would have otherwise spent on gifts (for Xmas, Valentine's Day, Birthday, etc.), and multiply that number by 10.    

So,  for instance, I would have normally spent $400 on gifts for her for X-mas, but am instead going to give her $4000 to pay down her debt.  Thus, by giving $4000, I am ""making"" $400 (10%) on that investment.  Combined with paying down debt with a 5% interest, I am actually making a 15% profit on my $4,000.

personalfinance,"Investing a portion of your ""Emergency Fund"" in lower risk funds?","Ok, so exposing an emergency fund to market risk is not advisable, but assumptions used to calculate 3-6 months can vary and the recommendation of 3-6 months itself is quite a large window.

&amp;nbsp;

To start off with, I'll say that I already have a Vanguard Roth IRA that is maxed every year, and a brokerage account where I put extra money.  My 401k is at 10%.  I don't have any CC debt.  My only debt is my house, which is at 3.875% interest rate.

&amp;nbsp;

I looked at my total average monthly spending and it comes to around $3,500.  I am using this as the number for calculating the needed 3-6 months of expenses for an emergency fund.  This number is quite conservative because it includes many expenses I could do without in an emergency (e.g., going out to restaurants, bars, movies, buying random stuff I don't need, etc) and it also includes mortgage, utilities, etc which are expenses that I normally split with my wife who makes a similar salary to me (we are both in the same profession).  So, I would say needing $3,500/month is a worst case scenario where I lose my job and my wife leaves me with the house (it could happen!).

&amp;nbsp;

Using $3,500, my recommended emergency fund is $10,500 - $21,000.  That is a $10,500 window for this recommendation, which is already using conservative $3500/month expenses to begin with.

&amp;nbsp;

I have been keeping $25,000 in my savings and $10,000 in my checking.  This is too conservative, and I have been mulling over lowering this number for some time now, which is why I have made this thread for discussion.

&amp;nbsp;

My current thought is to lower my cash position (checking+savings) to a total of $10,500 which amounts to 3 months of expenses using the conservative $3500/month assumptions.  The rest of the money would be invested in lower risk funds and essentially tagged as the remaining 3+ months of the emergency fund.  I could certainly liquidate and transfer the money to my bank account within 3 months.  The funds I was considering are -

&amp;nbsp;

Vanguard Target Retirement Income Fund (VTINX) - A low risk fund designed for retired people.  This fund contains a lot of bonds and may not be very tax friendly?

&amp;nbsp;

Vanguard Pennsylvania Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund Investor Shares (VPAIX) - contains municipal bonds that are federal/state tax free.  I'm not real sure on this one.  Are the tax benefits worth the slightly higher risk?

&amp;nbsp;


In summary my emergency portfolio would look something this:

Assume $3500/month expenses worst case-

$10,500 in checking/savings accounts (3 months)

$10,500 in VTINX (3 months)

$14,000 in either VTINX or my target date retirement fund... I'm mulling over whether I need another 4 months worth of emergency expenses in lower risk funds.

&amp;nbsp;

My main questions are:

* Is it reasonable to invest 3+ months of an emergency fund that has been calculated assuming conservative expenses in lower risk funds if you keep the other 3 months in a checking/savings account?

* What are your opinions of the funds that I have chosen for the lower risk investment (VTINX and VPAIX)?

* Which funds would you choose and why?",finance,1449102945

personalfinance,How should this student pay for an engagement ring?,"I plan to propose to my girlfriend in May or June of 2016.  I know it's irresponsible to buy a ring when I'm living on student loans, but it's worth it to me.  

The ring is $2,100.  For context, I'm currently a medical student living entirely on loans (~$85k/year).  I'm on track to go into a very high-paying specialty, so I'm not worried about eventually being able to pay back my loans.  Here are my options for paying for the ring:

* **Federal grad PLUS loans:** 6.84% fixed interest rate with a 4.272% loan fee.  Interest begins on dispersement, but I don't have to start making payments until 6 months after I graduate.
* **Cash:** ~$700 on hand
* **Credit card:** 15.24% APR w/ a $9,800 limit and $2,100 would get me about 1/4 of a flight in rewards points 
* **Layaway:** 10% down with cach or CC, then at least 10%/month.  I'd need to pay it off w/in 5 months to propose when I plan to.  
* **In-house jewler financing:** 10 month plan w/ 19.8% interest rate 
* **Personal loan:** Don't know anything about this, but CreditKarma tells me I'm eligible for a $5,000 personal loan for 36 months @ 8.61% APR.  

As you can probably tell after reading that, I'm pretty clueless when it comes to money.  Obviously the last 4 options will have to ultimately be paid by some combination of the first 2.  If there's some other option I don't know about, I'd love to hear more.  I just don't know what strategy makes the most sense for me and my credit score (currently a 723, but that should go up soon as I'm negotiating a pay for delete on a $263 dentist debt that was sent to a collection agency).

I am not finance savvy but I have had some success generating income in the past few years and Ive followed a few threads on here to make my decisions.  I hope you can help with this one.   


**TL;DR version.**  I receive this error when I try to deposit money into Vanguard.  	We can't accept this order. Contact us at 877-662-7447 for more information.


**All the boring details version:**
I first noticed in June when I tried to make a deposit that I was receiving this error.
I called the number they provided and the person on the other end of the phone told me this was because I needed to submit proof of identity. 

He told me the only way they can do this is through fax and gave me a fax number.  

That night I attempted to fax the information from FedEx and vanguard's machine wouldn't accept the transmission.  

I was frustrated and I went home and put it on the back burner. 
1 month ago today (11/2/2015) I called the same number (877-662-7447) and they told me the same reason for the error and provided me the same fax number.  I returned to FedEx and attempted again.   No dice.  Same timeout.  Vanguard wont accept the transmission.  While I was at the store I called customer support and they gave me an alternative fax number (same issue).  Then she gave me an address to mail my ID/Bank Statement and told me it will be opened within 1-2 business days of receiving but typically the same business day.  I put the information in the mail.

2 weeks later I attempt to deposit and I see the same error. 
I called back and they told me that they could confirm that they received it but this agent didn't know how long it takes for them to take action.  He assured me it would be ""soon"".  
Now it has been another 2 weeks and the same error is on my screen. 
I cant deposit and I cant withdraw.

I'm trying to get a job here but that won't cover college because college is ridiculous. So let me delve further into the financial issue. My mom makes 6 figures and she won't give me any money because she is, for some reason, controlled by her husband even though he can't do anything, doesn't have a job, and really doesn't do anything. My dad is not in my life and even though I have small contact with him, he will not pay for me or cosign a loan (neither will my mom or my grandma) and those are the only people who I can cosign with. Additionally, I can't get federal loans BECAUSE of my mom's income.

personalfinance,Applying for grad school starting Fall 2016 and just started researching student loans. Am I crazy for going all in?,"I'll start with the **TL;DR**: Because of life setbacks, living very frugally to pay off loans quickly would be detrimental to mental stability.  Is it feasible and realistic take out full student loans plus cost of living loans?

**Background story** on a throwaway account because it's important personal.

My senior year of college I was diagnosed with depression and was out of the workforce for a few years.  When I did start working, my part time salary grossed below federal poverty level and I survived solely on a little help from my parents and SSI/Medicaid.  

The past two I've been netting around 28k, but therapist and psychiatrist costs reduces that to an estimated 22k.  Basically, for my entire adult life I've been living like the aggressive debt-payers for the past 8 years and, quite frankly, I can't live this lifestyle any longer.  

**The Present:** I am finally healthy and ready to ""start my life"" and I have an opportunity to not only advance, but to accelerate my progress and my future earning potential.  The advanced analytics field has an optimistic the job market, and starting salaries are comparatively lucrative.  

Without any savings and parents who are no longer able to reduce my student loans or supplement my living expenses, it basically means that in order to go to grad school, I would need to borrow tuition and at least my current living expenses.

**THE Question**: Is taking out full loans for tuition and living expenses feasible?  I am perfectly willing to pay it out over an extended period of time.  The figures I've seen for starting salary of this high demand field is as low as 70k and as high as 110k.

investing,Top Car Stocks To Buy 2016,"Tesla was the top car stock last year but sold off in Q4 as we headed into 2016.  Below are my thoughts on Tesla stock in 2016 and other car stocks to buy.  General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) will continues to move sideways and are rated a sell for me.
There are many different ways to buy Car Stocks in the stock market.  You can buy the pure play automobile companies or buy the stock of auto suppliers.  Both of these sectors are a pure play on the US economy in 2016.
Vehicle stocks were flat ahead of 2016 because of the volatile late year stock market.  As we head into 2016, the Chinese economy and Interest Rate decisions will be the focus this year.  Car stocks mostly traded sideways in 2015 with big drops in Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VLKAY).  The top performing car stock was Honda (HMC) followed by Tesla (TSLA), which jumped over 6%.
Tesla Motors (TSLA) - Tesla (TSLA) is my top car stock in 2016 once again.  Tesla (TSLA) stock continues to see huge volatility but has been trending up.  The fact that Elon Musk only buys TSLA and never sells, this give confidence to current shareholders.  Tesla (TSLA) is expanding into battery production and will release more details of the Model 3 car in early 2016.  The model 3 vehicle will cost around $35,000 before government incentives.
Telsa (TSLA) stock is a strong buy below $200 in 2016 and I again have a price target of $300 per share.  If the company can report strong earnings and guidance, there is a chance we see $320-$350.
Toyota Motors (TM) - Toyota Motors (TM) stock rallied into the $140's last year but then pulled back late in the year. This automotive company continues to produce great vehicles with strong and efficient engines which is great for the consumer. I think Toyota can $145 at some point in 2016.  TM is a safe car stock to buy in 2016.
Ford (F) &amp; General Motors (GM) - Both Ford and GM are car stocks to sell in 2016.  If we hit another financial crisis, short these as much as you can.  Both Ford &amp; GM continue to make low priced and cheap vehicles that do not last.  Consumers find it very hard to trust these two brands.  If we see big gains from Ford &amp; GM in 2016, sell and buy into Tesla on a big dip.  Tesla is changing the car industry as we know it.  Electric Vehicles will continue to gain momentum and Tesla is building the charging network to power these vehicles.  I also view Honda Motor (HMC) as a safe car stock pick in 2016.",finance,1449156704

- Programmatic access for continuous integration/continuous delivery/Configuration Management tools preferably via SSH key 

- Roles assignment for access levels

- (would be nice) Can hook up to other roles servers like Apache Syncope

- The group understands that there is the cost of doing business but money is an object and they'd like to see solutions that are competitively priced

personalfinance,PSA: You Probably Don't Need a Financial Advisor,"Lots of people coming to /r/personalfinance ask if they need a financial advisor or if they should keep their existing one.  The answer is nearly always a resounding ""NO.""

People with simple situations - an income, some debt, a 401k/IRA, and normal expenses - don't need to pay someone to manage their money.  **The more people with their hands in your figurative pots, the less money you end up with.**  People that are in this situation should read the information found in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq), particularly [""I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). 

If you are paying an advisor already and are unsure of whether or not you should keep them, or if their decisions are good ones, ask yourself the following questions:

* Does my/can my situation fit into  [""I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)  If so, you probably don't need an advisor.

* Is my advisor **fee-only** (not ""fee-based"")?  If not, they are not obligated to make decisions that are in *your* best interests.  You should at least find a new, **fee-only** advisor, or stop paying one entirely.

* Is my advisor pitching products at me?  A great sign you've got a bad advisor is if they're recommending financial products like permanent (universal, whole, indexed universal, etc) life insurance plans, annuities, or mutual funds with loads.  None of these products have a place in most people's financial portfolios.  If your advisor is recommending any of these things they are likely just salespeople, whose goal is to transfer your money to them.

* Did a potential advisor cold call you?  Is a ""friend of a friend"" just starting at NWM and offering to sell insurance?  If so, they're only looking to make a commission on selling you crappy financial products.  Avoid.

**Managing your finances is not difficult.**  There are plenty of resources available for free on the interwebs if you don't want to look at the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq), and a [reading list](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/readinglist) if you want an analogue version.  You don't need to pay anyone to list your debts in order of interest rate, tell you to take advantage of your employer match, or that you shouldn't carry credit card debt.  

**There are situations in which seeking a fee-only, fiduciary financial advisor (or other financial professional) is a good idea.**  Complicated inheritances, very large windfalls, estate planning, expatriate finances and taxation, and other complicated tax issues may warrant hiring such a professional.  

**tl;dr** - make sure you're saving for your own retirement, not helping a financial salesperson save for theirs.",finance,1449159930

I currently have a job that makes about $100,000 before taxes. My take-home is around $65,000. My husband also has a job with a take home of $62,000.  We have two children with no plans for more.
My loans are now due and my first bill came in at $3,800 per month. This is based on a standard 10 year repayment with 6.8% interest. We cannot afford this at this time.
I have been researching payoff options and recently applied for income-based repayment. This means I would pay less over time and have a significant portion of my debt forgiven at the end of 20 years (around $400,000, due to interest.) However, I learned (from this sub, initially) that I would owe tax on that amount which would mean I would probably need another loan in order to afford the tax. 

Looking forward all I see is a never ending sea of debt and loans. 

Is there a resource to analyze whether it is better in the long run to ditch the debt as fast as possible or to stretch it out and rack up the interest but have a manageable monthly payment? I'm a bit lost at the moment and feeling extremely overwhelmed. 
Thank you.

personalfinance,(CAN) What's the best way to get out of my 2015 BRZ,"So, I traded my STI in for a new BRZ back in May in an effort to try to achieve a lower monthly payment, better fuel economy, lower maintenance costs, and just get into a car I actually could fall in love with. I was successful, but due to some changes in my personal/work life since then and now, I'm looking to get out of my industry four years earlier than I'd previously planned. I'm very much fed up and not really stoked on the idea of waiting a few years to get to a point where the car is worth more than the loan. 

The thing that sucks is that I had to carry over about 4K from my STI to buy the BRZ, so even though I got the BRZ with 0% interest, I still wound up with a final bill of $37,000 CAN. So far I've paid down 3,700. I'm basically trying to figure out the best way to get out of this as quickly as possible, I guess as far as timelines go I could probably stand to hold off until I've hit one year of ownership in May. But my first goal is to get rid of that debt because once I've done that I can immediately afford to pay rent somewhere and that frees me up to get out of living in a truck and go logging which is my final act of trucking before I get the hell out of this lifestyle.

personalfinance,Question about paying off student loans,"First time poster here.  I have a question that I’m hoping I can get some help with.  I currently owe over $71,000 in student loans.  Finished undergrad May 2010 and grad school December 2012 and had around $80,000, so I hadn’t made much progress with them until recently.  I make around $42,000 /year, and at the end of August I was blessed to get a part-time job paying $25/hour.  At the end of August, my loans were around $79,000. 

I’ve paid off a couple of loans since then and will be done with another one at the end of January, when I will be down to $66,000.  I’ve been paying these loans like crazy since I started working part-time, almost $8700 between September and now.  In February, this is what I will owe:

AES $13,066 at 5.44% variable interest
FedLoan $52,945.58 at 6.375% fixed interest.  
FedLoan is broken down like this: $32,734.83 subsidized (6.375%) and $19,507.06 unsubsidized (6.375%).  Unfortunately, even though it’s broken down separately it’s still considered one loan so when I pay, I’m paying towards the entire amount.

I’m a school counselor, so I can get the FedLoan one forgiven after 120 payments, but I just want to be student loan free ASAP so I'm choosing to pay it off!  It’s on an income driven repayment plan, so every July I have to submit my tax info and they base my payment off my adjusted gross income.

Unbury.me shows that it’s better to pay off FedLoan first.  When I’m done paying the loan I’m currently focused on, would it look suspicious if I start making $2,900 payments every month to FedLoan?  The payment right now is $250/month, but I know it will go up next fall since my income has increased.  This past summer I got the letter regarding turning in my income info and it said if I don’t submit the paperwork my payments will automatically be $600.  I was thinking that when I file my taxes in January and find out what my AGI is, I’ll call FedLoan and ask them what my payment will be based my AGI for 2015.  If it’s more than $600, I won’t submit my income next year, but if it’s less, I will submit it.  Is it possible that they would increase my payments next fall based on me paying at least $2,900/month starting in February?

I know it’s kind of a dumb question, but I just want to make sure I don’t screw myself over.  With my regular job I pay $500/month in student loans, but with my part time job it's always at least an extra $2500.  Thanks for the help!",finance,1449162810

personalfinance,I'm about to quit because I'm not getting paid. Want to know what I can do to get the money I'm owed. A couple of caveats though.,"Hi PF! Please excuse the throwaway, but I would really appreciate some advice.

I work from abroad for a US IT company in NY state (I'd just like to clarify here, I'm not some outsourced third-worlder, I'm a US citizen and pay my taxes in the US - I've just been living in Europe for the last few years) that is, well, basically going down the drain, mostly because the boss is the way he is, I'd rather skip the details if you don't mind. Bottom line is work has been slow since the summer and as a consequence payroll has not been on time. At first a little, then a little more and now I'm still trying to get the 11/1 paycheck (we're on a bi-weekly schedule, direct deposit). As you can guess I've had enough of this, not just with the money being late but with the attitude that I get which is ""not a big deal"" and constant BS I'm being fed - ""today"", ""tomorrow"", ""after the weekend"" etc. So tomorrow I will be sending an email basically saying ""I'll give you a week to fix this or otherwise I'm gone"".

My question is, if the boss is unwilling or unable to pay me and I do quit, what are my options on getting back the money I'm owed? I know there have been questions like this before, but my situation has two caveats:

1) I'm not physically in the country, so I can't walk into a labor board office (or wherever you go for these types of things). On the other hand, my father is, and if needed and indeed possible, he could act as an agent on my part, I guess. Does anyone know how a situation like this works and what I need to do exactly to file a complaint?

2) Like I said, the company is not in good financial shape, but I honestly don't know how bad it is. We could very well be going bankrupt any day without him telling us. I assume this may complicate matters in getting paid and if it does crap out completely, I'm sure there's going to be other people hunting for what they're owed (back rent, AmEx bill etc). Does this matter?

I'm a bit stressed out over this and I would be very grateful if you can point me in the right direction on what to do here. Thanks.",finance,1449170432

personalfinance,"Went into bank for a simple question, out of no where banker is trying to open a PLOC (Personal line of credit) on my account.","This is at Wells Fargo.

The other day I went into my bank to see if it would be possible to pay off my entire credit card balance on the first of every month, as oppose to paying off the balance on my last statement (to simplify my budgeting). To make this short, I found out that I can't. I would have to make a manual transaction myself in order to do this.

As I'm halfway through the conversation with the banker, he lets me know that since I been a customer for 13 years, and have had a credit card with them (with a $600 limit) for two years, that I qualify for a personal line of credit. This line of credit would give me access to $3,000 - $10,000. 

He proceeded to go ahead and start opening the PLOC on my account without actually asking me and confirming if I would like to have this line of credit opened! I immediately told him to hold off (I like to know what I'm getting into before I sign up for ANYTHING). He let me know that not a lot of people qualify for this, and that I should be lucky to be able to open it. I told him to hold off on opening the line of credit until I do some more research.

I told him that I currently use my credit card to earn points and build credit, I pay the balance in full every month and never use more then 30%. The credit card gives me rewards points (1 per every $) and does not have an annual fee. He mentioned that the PLOC is a great way to to build credit, but it does not have reward points and has a $25 annual fee.

I currently have a $9,000 rainy day fund and I'm saving roughly $1,500/month for a down payment on a house. So I obviously don't have the need to have access to $3k to $10k worth of money (which I will be charged interest on if I ever use it).

My question: Should I open the PLOC and use the money to build my credit? The banker said I could save 10s of thousands of dollars down the line when I get a mortgage for a house, by utilizing the PLOC to build my credit (which will allow me to get a lower interest rate on my mortgage in the future) 

What do you all think? Personally I like to keep my finances as simple as possible. I already don't like the idea that I need a credit card in order to build credit (one more think to track) and didn't get a credit card for the longest time because I always had a nice amount of money put away in the case there is an emergency. So I already have one credit card just for the sake of building credit and I would rather not have another account openned just for the sake of building credit. 

I also feel that the banker was being a bit pushy in having me sign up for this PLOC, almost as if he was more interested in earning some commission instead of looking out for my best interest.

personalfinance,What type of mortgage is best for me?,"This is a followup to a post I made over a month ago here: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3oownc/what_type_of_mortgage_should_i_get/

Now I have a lot more details and actually have to make a decision, so I wanted to run my thinking by everyone here for advice/scrutiny. 

I am buying a duplex in Oakland, CA with a purchase price of $895k. I plan to live in one unit with my girlfriend and rent out the other unit for roughly $2500/mo (probably more, but using this number as a conservative estimate). 

After talking with the lender today, here are the options I am considering:

**25% ($223K) down**

7/1 ARM: 3.75%

30y Fixed: 4.125% -&gt; 4.25%


**35% ($313k) down**

7/1 ARM: 3.625%

30y Fixed: 4.125% -&gt; 4.25%


None of these have any points. The ARM loan has an initial adjustment of up to 5%, up to 2% per adjustment period (1 year), and a lifetime max of 5%. 

I can comfortably pay either amount for the down payment with over $100k left over in either scenario. I have a stable job paying over $150k per year I will be able to cover the monthly payments in any case (not counting the rental income). Payment would be right around 31% of my gross income for the higher interest loan.

I plan to stay in this place probably about 7-10 years. After which point plan to buy another single family, more permanent home, and keep this one as a rental property renting out both units.

So I am leaning towards putting 25% down and a 30 year fixed. It's definitely hard to predict interest rates in the future, but given they are extremely low right now I figure there's a higher chance of the rates being higher than lower at the 7 year mark. However, the ARM loan would save me roughly $2500/year - is that enough to offset the risk of the interest shooting up in the future?

My MIL purchased a car on 10/27/15. Sticker price plus tax and tags=$24, 855, and financing=$13,745. She has undiagnosed/undocumented early alzheimers. I do not think she was taken advantage of, necessarily. She is with it enough to seem mentally okay out in public. But now that we are helping her with her bills, we are discovering some strange and poor choices. The most costly of which is this insane interest rate.

The car was purchased in Georgia. Now that I have read the fine print, it is clear that there is no ""cooling off period"" for Georgia. And we are past 30 days, anyway, if that makes a difference.
We are not in Georgia; she is staying with us in DC for a few weeks while we help her transition to her new place. She doesn't have any information about the loan with her. She says the payment book is being mailed to her Georgia address. Hopefully they will be forwarded (we have already changed her address with USPS), but until then, I have no account number or anything to try and access the terms of the loan online. I only have the terms of the sale, which lists the financing amount, monthly payment, and that it's for 5 years. Other than that, I am lost.

Tomorrow I am going to call the dealership and see what I can learn. But this is a $14,000 mistake. I would love any suggestions about how to get out of the loan, get rid of the car, ANYTHING.
[Another detail: She can comfortably afford to pay for the car in cash. Which is why this is strange. So if the solution involves getting rid of the car, buying another outright is no problem. And yes, her driving AT ALL is a little scary. One battle at a time.]

LONG PART:
So we're starting to go through a refinance and we're at the point where we're signing disclosure documents with a mortgage broker recommended by our financial advisor.

To this point we've opted for refinancing our current mortgage which has 25 years left @4.375% WITH a MI payment for a 15 year fixed @3.375 with no MI as long as our house hits the roughly expected appraisal price. Loan is for $252k and we hope to appraise at $315k to get our LTV. It appraised for $295k 5 years ago and since we've expanded and modernized the kitchen, converted the garage into living space and added a walk-in closet to the master.

In any case, initial estimate is almost $10k in closing costs. Having gone through this process recently for a different property I think they're estimating conservatively high (they're not accounting for current escrow balance anywhere for example) .. but if I wanted to opt for a no-cost, how would this change w/ regards to my interest rate and if I sign disclosures?

personalfinance,How I stayed motivated and focused.,"It's hard to stay focused and motivated while trying to pay off debt. More so if you have a lot of it. After reading a LOT here I decided to post up about how I managed to stay focused and so far brought 28K is debt down to 12K. It's not the cheapest way(mathematically) to do it but it was the way that kept me motivated and driven to do it.

* Make a spreadsheet of expenses, and COLOR CODE IT. 

It helped me a lot to plot out what my expenses were against my paycheck. It was great adjusting everything and making the **RED** go down and the **GREEN** go up. I adjust it every couple of months to make sure I'm not drifting and that there are not places I can still cut from.

* Use your credit card to check your free credit report every month.

I use my AmEx and Discover to watch my credit number change. This is less about the number and more about reminding yourself that you are on the right track. I have watched mine move from 640 to just over 750. It's nice motivation to see it creep up slowly over time.

* Use the 1/2 rule

With my company my bonus is paid out every quarter. Using the 1/2 rule I use 1/2 to put to paying off bills. The other 1/2 I split again. 1/2 is mine to spend and 1/2 goes into my ROTH IRA. For example if it was $400. $200 would go to my largest debt, $100 to my ROTH and $100 to spend on myself. It's money I don't already have factored into my normal income so it's just what it is. A bonus.

* Pay all your debts, but focus on the smaller ones.

This is the one that many will disagree with. It makes more sense financially to pay off your debt first with the highest interest rate first. In my case though I paid off a 3K card, another 3K card, then a 5K card and now am focusing on my largest one. As I focused on the first 3K card the 2nd dropped to about 2.5K. After they were done the 5K card was down to 3.5K. My last card that was 17K is now down to 12K. It's a lot less daunting to see 12K then 17K. Also as I paid off the others the money I could use to pay off the others rolled into the next one I was focusing on. Instead of only having $500 available to throw at it I now have $1200 a month I can throw into it. It also leaves me with less things to track as those other cards now sit mostly unused.

**I hope these help someone as much as it has helped me. I have cut over 16K of debt in 8 months, and will be completely free in less than another year. As I said there are ""better"" ways to do it mathematically, but if motivation is your problem, this helped me a LOT.**",finance,1449195007

Yes, I know.  That's godawful.  You don't have to tell me, I totally get it.  That's why I'm looking at possibly refinancing.  I made a poor financial decision long *before* I became interested in saving money. 

I'm actually very happy with where my loan is at right now as far as the balance is concerned.  For quite some time, it felt like I wasn't making *any* progress on it.  I don't know if it was because so much was going towards interest or what, but it seemed like it would only go down by like $150 per month despite paying $280.  

I expected to still owe like $8,800 because last I checked it was almost $9,000.  I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.

Anyway, I'm trying to figure out what my best option would be.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't they get most of the interest in the first portion of the loan period, and then as you make payments, you're paying less interest and more towards the principle?

Because of that, wouldn't it be counter intuitive to assume that refinancing for a better interest rate would be beneficial?

I would also like to possibly get this thing paid off sooner.  I could probably make additional payments, but I would almost prefer to have new terms allocating my balance over a 2 year period, or something like that.  *Unless* I would probably end up paying more total because of the interest.

I don't know.   What do you think?  I know it's probably difficult without knowing the exact details, but is it generally a bad idea at this point?  

For the record, it was a 5 year loan for like $11K total.",finance,1449197217
finance,Having problems naming a term in a model (MARR vs ERR vs ?),"Howdy all.   First off this may seem like a mortgage question but its not so please keep them fingers off the ban button for one quick second.

I'm currently working on a fairly simple mortgage model.  It looks at different mortgage rates etc and calculates income taxes and whatnot and says which one gives the best NPV.

One variable we have in the model is the interest rate earned on the residual net income (after making mortgage payments).  Like the money you put into retirement or whatever.   This is an *incredibly* important variable as changing it will dramatically shift the loan preference from the shorter lower interest models (10 year) to the longer higher interest options (30 year) since the former sees more income in later years which are worth a lot less if you follow time value of money.  

I just can't figure out what to call this.  I want to call this the MARR, but I'm not sure that's appropriate here.   I'm more tempted to call it the ERR (external rate of return) since we're talking about re-investing income which is how I understand ERR, but I have to be honest I have a hard time with ERR.

In 1 year, $4,000 will be written off.

Obviously my loan will be accruing interests while part of the loan gets written off.  I'm curious how I should structure my payments as this is happening. My loan's interest rate is roughly 6.5%.

My lender provides the following two options:

**Apply as Refund**
This selection only affects accounts that aren't in repayment yet AND are within 120 days of you receiving loan funds.
Your early payment will reduce the amount of money you borrowed (principal). Any existing accrued interest will be recalculated based on the reduced principal. This reduces your overall accrued interest — saving you the most money in the long run.


**Apply as Payment**
Your early payment will be applied first to any accrued interest, then to your principal balance. This helps you keep up with your accrued interest so it's not capitalized, but you won't benefit from the reduced principal that refunds provide.


At first glanced, it seems like the second option is the best one as it allows me to keep up with the interest rates while waiting for my loan forgiveness to kick in.",finance,1449210861

The biggest red flag I see is the 11.55% interest rate, which I think even for a first time buyer is pretty bad, right? My FICO score is around 650, and I think it's because when I got the vehicle, the employee at CarMax did a bunch of pulls which hurt my score. And apparently, I have a ""serious delinquency"" to DFAS from when I was in ROTC for a couple years, I haven't been able to get a hold of anyone there to find out more information yet.

My main concerns are taking away extra money I have that is flexible (about $80/paycheck if I contribute 6%) in to something that isn't guaranteed.",finance,1449240533

personalfinance,"I work for a very small business, which was just sold to a new owner. As most senior employee, I am basically expected to continue running operations and train new owner on everything. How do I open negotiations for better pay?","So, for a little back story... I work at very a very small (approx. 5 employees) company in California. We are a luxury tour company that involves restaurants and venues and maintaining relationships with those venues as well as scouting new restaurants/venues. 

I have worked for the company for close to two years. I am in charge of training new guides, I am basically the ""account man"" - I assure everything is in its place, everyone is happy, as well as dealing with clients. Essentially - I run things. My boss ran ""behind the scenes"" things like ticketing and managing finances. I've been told by many vendors that they really appreciate my professionalism and commitment to my work, and that they wouldn't participate without me around - which of course feels great for my ego. I run the social media accounts for our company as well. 

My boss (the woman who started the company) had to move out of state about 8 months ago. By out of state, I mean across the country. So of course my responsibilities grew, as I was basically standing in for her and running the company ""in person"". However, after a couple months realized I just wasn't being paid well enough to really justify the amount/type of work I was doing. Basically, I figured out I was being taken advantage of. **I am an independent contractor, and currently make a percentage of ticket sales for tours I conduct, and a couple dollars over minimum wage on hours that I spend doing other activities for the business. Which does not amount to much.** So I have been drafting up an email to kind of explain my feelings and thoughts moving forward when...

I get a call yesterday informing me that she sold the company. Of course, I was a little miffed that she didn't really consult me whatsoever, or really consider passing operations to me officially since that is what is basically happening anyways. So now I'm expected to continue running things here on the ground as well as basically train my boss. For not a whole lot of money. I don't want to come into the meeting with New Boss today with guns slinging like ""pay me more or I walk"", but that is essentially how I feel.

Oh, and the kicker? The woman who bought the company came on one of my tours and was so impressed with what we do that she reached out to my boss to purchase the company. Which of course, feels great for the ego. 


I am extremely nervous. I don't have any idea what to say or how to say it.

I have never dealt with something like this before, and really don't know how to play the cards I have. Any advice is very appreciated. Thank you so much for reading and your responses! 

**TL;DR: I have been running a small company while the owner is across the country. My compensation has not been equal to the work. A new person has bought the company and wants to keep things the same - so I will still be running operations and teaching her about what we do.

personalfinance,"About to be a real adult, need help budgeting with loans","I just landed a job with a $48,000 annual salary. I'm trying to figure out the best way of budgeting all of my expenses so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Let me provide some details on my general expenses and savings situation.


The firm I'm going to be working for does a 1 to 1 match up to 4% for a 401k. That equates to $1800 and I'd like to do that full amount. I also have a Roth IRA that I opened up a few years ago with a check I received from my grandparents. That has ~$5200 in it right now and I'd like to know how much I should put into that every year.


I live in Washington DC and my rent is $1282 a month. My roommate and I switch back and forth each month paying the entire utilities and internet bills. Our building also adds on $25 a month for this stupid trash valet service. In total, I pay on average $1350 a month for all of this together. $16,200 a year.


I want to allot $50 a week to groceries so $2600 a year. And ~$100 a month for public transportation (the job will allow my to receive that money untaxed) so $1200 a year. I don't have, want, or need a car.


Here's where the expenses get tricky. I have a boatload of college loans I have to begin paying off in February.


I took out a college loan from my bank for a year's tuition. I owe back $37,000 and it has a variable interest rate of 6.18%. ~$8000 of that loan ended up not being used because I was able to become a part time student for my last semester. That money currently sits in my bank account and is set to be used to incrementally pay the full $37k back at a rate of about $430 a month. 


Throughout college, I got loans through the financial aid office at my school. They are as follows:

Subsidized- $3500- 3.4%

Unsubsidized- $2550- 6.8%

Unsubsidized- $7900- 6.8%

Unsubsidized- $7000- 3.86%

Unsubsidized- $7900- 4.66%


So I've basically got about $66,000 in debt with a variety of interest rates on the loans. There is a chunk of money leftover in a separate college fund around $5000. That could also be used to incrementally pay off some of these loans or do a big payment now. I'd like to be able to put some money into my roth IRA each year, set aside a certain amount of savings each year as an emergency fund, pay off as much of these loans as I can, and still have a reasonable amount of spending money for things like dates or visiting my family every once in awhile. Any advice on what steps I should take? Anything would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Loan Repayment Approach -- Is Avalanche really the best way?,"I'm pretty sure I understand the difference between the Avalanche and Snowball methods to paying off loans.

**Avalanche Method**-- paying off the loan with the highest interest rate (i.e. 6% vs 4%). **Snowball Method**-- paying off the loan with the smallest loan balance (i.e. $2,000 vs $6,000).

If we're talking pure math, shouldn't the Avalanche method actually refer to the highest *daily interest rate*? Consider this example, you have to repay Loan A: principal $20,000 interest rate 4% *daily interest* $2.19, Loan B: principal $2,000 interest rate 6.8% *daily interest* $0.37. If you use the Avalanche method and decide to pay off Loan B first, wouldn't you be paying more interest over the life of these loans?

So far, my approach to paying off my loans has been to apply my payment to the loan(s) that have the highest daily interest rate. I'm trying to find some support to whether this is the best method or if I should just take the standard Avalanche method.

I think it's important to note that this would be appropriate when comparing a student loan to a car loan. Also important to note that these loans have fixed interest rates.

I had overdraft protection with an annual fee, which I also cancelled at the same time (because obviously I wouldn't need it if I didn't have an account with them!). I received a statement from them claiming that I owed the annual fee, even though my effective cancellation date was before the fee was applied. I disputed the account through the credit bureaus they were reporting to, but was basically told that it was a legitimate charge.

I took a job this summer after being out of work since 2013, and I am looking for a bit of perspective and some advice.

I am on salary for a non-profit at about 100k per year, but since I started late in the year I will actually earn about 40k this year.

 I am paying about $1000 per month in rent and another 100 dollars per month in utilities for a two bedroom apartment.

I have three cars, and a serious set of headaches because of them. One car is inoperable, and I haven't even paid for it to be towed to a mechanic. One car is at a mechanic, and I am waiting to hear how much money they will need for it to be repaired. The last car runs and drives well, but is nearly 30 years old. All three are probably only worth 3500 dollars altogether, if I get them running again.

I have 88k in student loan debt, all federal loans. These collect interest at approximately $4000 per year. I spent the last year in Income Based Repayment, which rendered my minimum payment at 0 dollars per month, and my job is appropriate for student loan forgiveness after 10 years of qualifying payments.

I am putting 15% of my income into a retirement account, and my employer matches the first 5% of my income, so I am really saving 20% of my pay in pre-tax savings.

I don't pay for health insurance yet, but I will be 26 next year and I am thinking about which health plans to choose from. I pay car insurance every six months, and the last time I paid around 850 dollars for liability only, state minimum insurance. I pay about 100 dollars per month in groceries, another 100 per month on clothes and household goods, and I pay up to another 100 dollars per month in gasoline, but usually less than that due to my commute being very short.

I currently have about 5000 dollars in the bank, and I am wondering how to improve my situation.

If I stay in IBR for my student loans for the next 10 years, I can pay essentially 90% of the principal and no interest since the debt will be forgiven.

As an alternative I could just try to pay off the debt and not worry about it, but then I would pay probably 12 to 16 thousand dollars more over the next 10 years as well as contribute less to retirement early in my career. I would also have the flexibility to take a job at a for profit organization.

Should I open an IRA? I'm leaning towards one so that I can minimize my taxable income, but that also means that I have to pay taxes when I withdraw the earnings, right?

I spent a great deal of money moving for my current job, and I am still not done furnishing my apartment. I don't have a television, for instance, and there are lots of appliances that I do without.

I try to live frugally, I don't eat out beyond a cup of coffee once or twice a month, no pleasure traveling, etc.

investing,Maybe oil is all that matters,"I was in high school in the 90s, and when I started driving, gas was $0.78 per gallon where I lived.  At that time, we basically had full employment, robust economic growth, and basically the advent of the consumer electronics market as a driving economic force.  

By the time I was 20, fuel was about $2, the economy entered recession, the .com sector collapsed, and unemployment was on the rise.  

Things didn't get much better for 15 years, through two presidents, a couple of wars, trillions in stimulus spending, job programs, financial regulations, etc., etc., etc.

Even until last year, the unemployment rate largely decreased only because 40% of the population was considered to be out of the labor market, wages were stagnant, growth was very slow.

And, now, oil has crashed again.  Unemployment is down, labor participation is up, growth is stronger, interest rates are increasing, home values are gaining steam, durable goods orders are up...2016 is shaping up to be another 1997.

Occam's razor tells me that the explanation doesn't require complex analysis, but is just that fuel costs are the primary indicator of overall economic health in the U. S. (and, so, the world).  It makes a lot of sense to me, since at $4.00 per gallon of fuel, I was spending nearly $500 per month in fuel for me and my wife, and now we're spending  $200 - I'm not pocketing the $300 savings, I'm buying TVs, going out to dinner, buying appliances, and so on.

Basically, I joined the military a number of years ago and got stationed in a different state.  I maintained my home state as ""home of record"" and per the law have to file my taxes there.

I've never missed a federal deadline, and I've filed my federal return each and every year, so that's not an issue.

The first year I filed taxes back to my home state, I failed to realize that I was entitled to a $5000 deduction for being active duty military.  I computed that I owed Indiana about $43.00 and wrote them a check for it.

Two weeks later IN DOR sent a check back to me for the same amount I wrote them.

Again, this was because I wasn't aware of the deductible, but they were good enough to catch my error and say ""hey you didn't owe us money at all, we owed you.""

Problem is I was.. well, to put it bluntly a stupid procrastinator.  They attached no coorespondece with the check explaining any of that, all I got was the check.  I was planning to call them and ask what was going on but I never did.

Then I deployed and didn't bother even doing state that year though i did do federal.

Next year after that I realized ""fuck I didn't even file for Indiana last year"" and I just basically skipped doing so again.

This went on and now I finally am freaking out as it's been several filings that I've missed at this point.

I have all my W2's and my 1040's from the federal return all in a file, so I have easy access to that.

I want to make this right.. I'm stating to get super paranoid it's going to come back and bite me in the ass in a huge way.. I don't want to get in trouble over taxes.  I have a decent savings and want to just pay any fines and get this all fixed.

Thing is one day I stayed up all night doing my taxes and yeah with that deductible it turns out they would have owed me money each time I filed.

So with that in mind, how should I proceed.  I don't want to just turn in all of them late and say ""oh here's my several years late tax return btw you owe me $200"" that seems absurd.

I GOogled the law as best as I can and it seems they have a 100% penalty for late filing due to negligence.. so basically double what you owe.  Does that mean if I owe -$20 it cancels out to just zero?

Again, I'm not seeking money.. I am seeking reconciliation with being a delinquent filer.

Should I just call them?  I'm afraid once I call them and talk to someone it's going to flag me.  I know it's the right thing to do but I just would hate to wreck my career and get in legal trouble, if there's an easier way to get back on the right side of the law, pay anything I owe, and avoid any ugliness.

If anyone can help me I'd greatly appreciate it.

EDIT: another interesting tid bit.. that check they wrote me back, I never even deposited it or cashed it.. I still have it sitting in my tax records box.  Fuck I wish I would have been responsible back then and just called them and figured stuff out.  I still had a lot of growing up to do then :/",finance,1449269717

ethereum,Could an off-chain key manager link contracts to outside accounts?,"Hi Fellow Etherits,
 Long time fan, new poster here.  I wanted to ask about a concept that I have not seen discussed fully. 

  Could two parties could use an ethereum contract in conjunction with an off-chain encrypted key manager that reads the result of a block chain contract and then releases a key that would then enable the winning party to access an external bank accounts, bitcoin accounts etc?

The key manager would be encrypted  code that could be copied and distributed among the interested parties. 

Each party would load a secret key into the key manager program that includes code specifying if the ethereum contract value=y, then release key x. 

The program that generates the off-chain key manager could verify that it responds correctly to the block chain, and demonstrate that it can access a bank account etc. 

Setting up such a thing seems feasible given my limited understanding of cryptography. 

 What I am wondering is if it can be made to read the real blockchain reliably. 
That is it seems the key manager could be tricked to revealing its secrets by placing it in a virtual world where it is fed false data in order to trick it to release the key. 
Here is where I know for sure I am out of my depth. 
One guess is it is possible for the program to verify that the blockchain it is reading is legitimate if it can check for a shared secret with an outside semi-trusted source.  That is the key manager could read a different block chain contract that would be updated each block with a new hash based on input of the previous block, the main contracts state and a secret offline key stored by a third party.  This secret could be staked and distributed. 

Thoughts?  
Thanks",cryptocurrency,1449278921

personalfinance,Your Defaulted Federal Student Loans Could Cost You That Tax Refund,"Tax refund offsets are one of the government’s powerful tools to collect federal student loans.  The government may take your income tax refund if you are in default. A number of states also have laws that authorize state guaranty agencies to take state income tax refunds. Computer records of all borrowers in default are sent to the I.R.S. Borrowers in default can expect to have all or a portion of their tax refund taken and applied automatically to federal student loan debt.
If you’re a Federal Student Loan Borrower, and you haven’t been making payments, be careful before filing your tax return.

One of the collection tools available for defaulted federal student loans is called a Federal Income Tax Return Intercept. Depending on the status of your federal student loan, you may end up losing your tax refund. Best to tread carefully.

If you’re not making payments because you have a deferment or forbearance, do yourself a favor and double check the status of that.

Deferments and forbearances come in 6 and 12-month time spans.  If you don’t know when it ends, make a call to your student loan servicer and verify it is still active.  If it is still active then you have nothing to worry about in terms of filing your taxes.

If, however, the deferment or forbearance ended, you may be in trouble depending on how long ago it ended.  If you only missed a few payments, even as many as 6, you should have time to save your loan from going into default.  Call your servicer and ask how.  If you’ve missed 9 or more payments, your loan is likely in default.

If your loan is in default, you may not get your tax refund due to a Federal Income Tax Return Intercept.
Mechanics Of the Federal Income Tax Return Intercept

Here’s how it works. The U.S. Department of Education sends a note to the Treasury who, upon being told by the IRS to issue a refund check, instead forwards the funds to the U.S. Department of Education to be applied towards your defaulted federal student loan balance.
Check the status of your loan.  If you’re safe, go ahead and file.

If you’re in default, use this time to take action.  Get your loan out of default, get a payment plan you can afford, and then you can file your tax return.  Can you fix your default before the April 15th deadline?  It is possible, but you may find it less stressful to file an extension until October to research and act on the best method to fix your default.  Do your homework now – it could cost you if you don’t.",finance,1449279912

technology,I quit my ISP and survived on 1GB of data from my phone,"Hi there Reddit technology friends. As the title mentions, I got tired of my ISP taking advantage of me so I cut my internet cord and spent a month using only 1 GB of data through my mobile phone plan. I've been seeing so many posts about ISP shenanigans lately I decided to do a quick write up on my experience in case anyone else is curious about jumping off of the traditional ISP train. Apologies, it's kind of a long post, but I included a TL;DR at the end for convenience. If you're curious about doing something similar but need a bit of reassurance, feel free to ask me any questions and I'll try to help clarify as much as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why I did this**

Over the past couple of years the cost for the internet package I purchased through my ISP gradually increased. I was a bit of an idiot and accepted that the price would go up slightly over time. The ol' bring a frog to boiling water trick worked on me but the cost finally got to a breaking point. I called up my ISP to downgrade to a more affordable speed and they gave me a returning customer ""deal"" where I could keep my current speed and they would bring the cost  down to the original price. As a bonus they were going to send me some new equipment since mine was so old. Flash forward to my next bill; it was even more than what I was currently paying due to activation fees for the new equipment they sent me. I blamed myself for being an idiot again and falling for the new equipment trick but I was really irritated at being taken advantage of by my ISP. Flash forward to the next bill; no more activation fees but the price was just as high as it was when I made the call to downgrade. At that point I was so fed up at being repeatedly scammed I decided that I would go without an internet service and only use my phone's data plan for my internet needs.

&amp;nbsp;

**What I used**

I won't mention which ISP I was purchasing from due to my tin foil hat fear that they will see this post, figure out who I am, and make some fake claims that I still owe them money to punish me. I also won't outright say which service provider I use for my cellphone so this doesn't come off as some advertising conspiracy. The details of my phone plan will likely give away which provider I'm using but I wanted this to be an honest attempt to share my experience. I was never big into using my phone for things I would normally use my computer for, so I was running on 1GB of 4G data per month. As self-punishment for being an idiot and falling for multiple tricks my ISP pulled on me, I decided that before increasing my phone data plan I would go a month with only the 1 GB to save a bit of cash and to also experience life with limited internet use. I was using an iphone 6 plus and I  imagine this experience would have required more patience if I was running on hardware that was a couple years older.

&amp;nbsp;

**What I could do**

 The way my phone provider worked was that once my 1GB of 4G data was up, I had unlimited data at very reduced speeds. The first thing I wanted to learn was what those reduced speeds were capable of. After cancelling service from my ISP I had about 1 week until the next period for my phone plan. I decided to quickly max out the remaining 4G data for that month and live the next week at the reduced speeds. I learned that with a bit of patience I could pay my bills, use google maps, use email, and even slowly browse articles. Watching videos was certainly not going to happen but I could take care of all my essential internet needs like paying bills and even keep up with current events by patiently waiting for websites to load. After that week of experimenting with reduced data speeds I began my one month on 1GB of 4G data.

 I found that browsing websites while making sure to avoid video content was pretty reasonable for data usage. I also used some navigation apps like google maps and my city's public transit system app and they didn't cause me any alarm for data use. The one big benefit of having access to 4G data compared to the reduced speeds was how quickly websites could load. Also, I guess if I absolutely needed to, I could watch a few minutes of a video while that was never going to happen on the reduced speeds. I could also use my phone as a hotspot for my computer anytime I really needed the larger screen.

&amp;nbsp;

 **What I couldn't do**

 I ran a quick experiment with Netflix to see how much data I would use at the lowest quality settings. The app says the lowest quality setting uses about 0.3 GB/hour but after running it for ten minutes and extrapolating I estimated that it would use about 0.5 gigs/hour. I wasn't willing to burn through all my data to see how accurate real world use was compared to the data usage claim so I figured that if I wanted the 1 gig to last the entire month I wouldn't be able to watch Netflix. I also made the assumption that other sources like Youtube, Crackle, Hulu, and Amazon video would be roughly equivalent or worse for data usage so I went the month without watching any video content at home. Side note, I grew to absolutely loath websites that auto-play videos.

 Although I was taking care of my essential internet needs and going without movies/shows wasn't too bad, there were a few things I missed. I used to play online games once in a while with friends from school that now live on the opposite side of the country to help us keep in touch. I had to bail out on a session with a buddy and revert to email to catch up with him. I also couldn't have a facetime session with my sister for her birthday and had to stick to a standard voice call. Not a huge deal either way, but a couple small things that made me question my commitment to escaping my ISP.

The one thing that really bothered me was that if I tried to download something over 100 MB (if I'm remembering correctly) a little message would pop up on my phone saying I had to connect to wifi to perform that download because it was too large. This included app updates which I think could be a very frustrating experience for anyone trying to survive only on a phone data plan for their internet needs.

&amp;nbsp;

 **Where I'm at now**

 I eventually increased the data plan for my phone and introduced some solid entertainment back into my life with Netflix and Youtube. I still face the frustration of not being able to download large files or updates at home but I'm very lucky to work at a company that lets its employees join their phones to wifi in the office so I'm able to perform downloads for my phone Monday through Friday. I could also grab a coffee at a nearby cafe and jump on its wifi if I need to download something. Having 1GB of data was enough to take care of the things I needed to do and having a higher data plan is barely different than getting internet through a traditional ISP. The only thing I'm really missing out on now is online gaming but it's a small sacrifice I'm happy to make. 

I'll even go as far to say that I think most people frustrated with their ISP can switch over to using their phone's data plan for all of their internet needs so long as they have a way to jump on wifi once in a while for larger downloads. I know there has been some controversy with T-mobile's new streaming policies regarding net neutrality and I don't want to comment too much on this since I'm not an expert, but I do feel that mobile phone plan providers are starting to make serious competition for traditional ISPs. Maybe if more people embrace the competition it will help force ISPs to stop scamming customers.

During my little internet experiment I was talking to a friend one time about ditching my ISP and found myself saying that I recognize I'm missing out on some conveniences but it feels amazing to be free of the clutches of my old ISP. I also feel like I'm fighting shady ISP practices with the only thing they care about, my dollar. It may just be a drop in their money bucket, but I made my stand and I'm not looking back.

&amp;nbsp;

 **TL;DR**

Got tired of my ISP tricking me for more money, cut my internet cord, survived on 1GB/month with no issues, increased my phone data plan to get back some entertainment I missed, never going back to a traditional ISP unless they make some major changes to how they treat customers, I recommend jumping off the ISP train to anyone interested!

personalfinance,Completely Lost With Investing,"Evening all! I apologize for the short novel, but I wanted to be as transparent as possible.

**Back story:**
I’m in the Army and fell into the standard, my ex-wife was terrible and ruined my life while I was in Afghanistan, fairytale. I ended up having to start over with nothing at the age of 24, in the summer of 2014. I spent the remainder of that summer and much of the following fall burning through money in what turned out to be a quarter life crisis. It wasn’t the most intelligent period of my life, but it happened. 

**Current situation:**
Fortunately, I chose to stay in the Army which bought me a lot of financial stability.  I finally wised up and began consistently saving and I’m on track to meet my personal goal of having $30,000 in savings on 1 February (near my 26th birthday). At that point, I will have about 18 months left in the Army if I choose to get out. Each of those months will bring me $4,400. Having rebuilt my emergency fund, I want to turn toward investing. I'm apprehensive about opening myself up to the risk of losing piles of money on ""the market"", so I'd like to have a mostly conservative (60-75%) portfolio. The Army doesn't offer any sort of matching type thing, but I can get in on a thrift savings plan (TSP). 

At the end of my current contract, I may very well leave the Army and go to college. I’ve been burning the midnight oil to knock out an AA while I’m in (I’m about 8 classes short) because the Army pays for it, minus books and a $40 per class fee (this is in no way a complaint). If I’m able to leave the Army with an AA, I will be able to apply my GI Bill toward completing my BA and MA effectively leaving me with an MA at the cost of living expenses for those years. I plan on working during that time, but I want to have the ability to jump on unpaid internships in order to make myself as competitive as possible.

edit: word choice

----------------------

Edit 2: Okay, since a couple people have asked what my specific questions are, I'll add a bit more detail. First, my main question is HOW IN THE HELL AM I EVER GOING TO PAY THESE SUCKERS OFF?

Here's the gist: I have 2 federal loan servicers with multiple loans under each servicer, and 1 private loan servicer. I had another private loan under a different servicer but I defaulted on it and it went to collections a few years ago. I defaulted because when I graduated they hiked my interest up from 5% to something like 11 or 13% so I was paying several hundred dollars a month to just maintain my debt and they were unwilling to work with me. 

Most of my debt is Federal Stafford loans, and most of them are at 6-6.8% fixed interest. My private loan I haven't defaulted on seems the least harmful at 4% interest (variable though). I haven't been in contact with the collection agency in months, and I'm a little worried that one will come and lash out at me soon. 

The other loans I have are currently in good standing, but I'm barely chipping away at my debt considering I'm on IBR plan on all but my private 4% loan which I am paying back at standard repayment. So for some of my federal loans I'm barely paying anything, and on others I'm paying but my payments aren't even covering the interest they accrue for the month. 

The whole thing is so complicated and I feel like I need someone to sit down with me and look at the mess I'm in and give me a step by step process for how to most effectively pay down this debt. Right now I can't pay much more than what I am paying (my monthly payments are about $450), but I am considering moving back to my hometown to LIVE WITH MY MOTHER... ugh... in order to pay faster. If I'm going to do that I want to know the quickest and most effective way to pay off the most amount of debt possible. Gotta make that time count for something. I feel like I'm sending myself off to jail. 

Any advice? Hope this helps.

personalfinance,Re-Finance Question,"So I originally took a loan in 2009 for $130,000 and went the FHA route with a 5.25% interest rate for 30 years. Recently our mortgage lender called us about refi and started throwing some numbers at me and pushing to close.

So his first offer was another 30 year at 4.6% and he would cover closing costs, but this put me at an 87% TIP. I'm not very good financially, but I could tell this probably was not a good deal.

I contacted another mortgage lender and got a 15 year at 3.375% ( FHA ) with the caveat that he would cover $1500 in closing costs increasing my principal by about $6,000. This sounded bad at first, but instead of paying $117 to principal I would be paying a little over $500 to principal each month. I asked if we paid the 6k up front would that make a difference, but he said it changed my monthlies by about $18.

So my original lender made another offer with a 23 year loan at 4.2% , but covering all closing costs with no increase in my principal. When I put all the numbers into a mortgage calculator it still showed I would pay almost double the interest over the 15 year.

I feel like the 15 year is the best choice despite the increase in principal ( which I would pay off in the first year ), but I'm not 100% certain.",finance,1449335647
economy,Why the Dollar wont collapse - at least in the short term,"At the end of World War Two, the Bretton Woods system was established for world currencies. This system involved countries fixing their currencies to the US Dollar, which in turn was tied to the value of gold at a fixed exchange rate of $35 per ounce. As this was a fixed exchange rate system it effectively forced countries to pursue a certain monetary policy, in order to keep their currency pegged to the Dollar and in turn the value of gold.

However, during the post war era, and particularly in the 1960s the US was spending vast sums of money on warfare (Cold war, Vietnam War), and on improved welfare. The US was financing this by increasing the money supply through ‘monetising debt’ – the US government was issuing debt to finance its spending and the Federal Reserve was purchasing the debt, and holding it, until it became due. As a result not all US Dollars were backed up by gold, meaning the value of each Dollar in real terms was falling. As the money supply increased, gold reserves fell from 20,000 tonnes at the start of the Bretton Woods system to around 8,000 tonnes by 1971. Countries around the world were exchanging Dollars for gold, due to its declining value.

To meet the living standards US citizens demanded and the increased levels of government expenditure the Bretton Woods system became unsustainable for the US, and on August 15th 1971 President Richard Nixon officially ended the relationship. Since the demise of the Bretton Woods system the US has run a budget deficit every single year, right up to the current day. US gross debt (Federal, State and Local) stands at around $18 trillion, and the forecast is only for it to keep rising.

Even President Carter who only became President 3 years after Nixon left office, appears to allude to the problem that was developing in his famous ‘Crisis of Confidence’ speech in 1979; ‘In a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close knit communities, and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but what one owns. But we’ve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our long term meaning…’

So why do people think the Dollar is going to Collapse?

When the Bretton Woods system was first introduced and the Dollar became the world’s reserve currency the US economy had a sizeable advantage over the rest of the world. Europe and Japan were recovering from World War Two and there was the Soviet bloc behind the iron curtain. At one point over 80% of transactions around the world were performed in US dollars. However in the decades that followed Europe resurged, with the single market and European Union being created, Japan expanded rapidly throughout the 1980s, and more recently there has been the rise of China. The US economy no longer has the complete dominance over the world economy it once had.

US Government Debt is currently at around $18trillion, with a trade deficit of around $800 billion a year. Including the debt of US businesses, and US citizens this figure is more like $60 trillion! This trade deficit is being funded by other countries, and investors around the world, which are buying US Government bonds. Along with the fact so many of the world’s transactions are made in US Dollars its value is being supported. Asian countries in particular have wanted to support the value of the Dollar, so US consumers can continue to buy their goods.

However the Asian countries that grew so rapidly throughout the 1990s and 2000s, have recently been making suggestions they are going to move away from the US dollar. Just on Monday November 30th, it was announced that China’s Yuan (also known as the Renminbi) is to join the IMF’s Special Drawings Rights basket (SDR), alongside the Dollar, Pound, Euro and Yen, effectively making it another reserve currency in the world.

With the rebalancing  of Asian economies towards an increase in domestic consumption, along with increased trade in Europe (recent UK – China trade agreements), Asian investors may no longer feel comfortable holding so much of their foreign reserves in Dollars. If the number of worldwide transactions in Dollars continues to fall, and US debt continues to climb, we will eventually reach a tipping point. Investors will no longer buy US Government bonds, as they won’t believe the US Government is solvent (same issue which is currently effecting Greece), and if the number of Dollar transactions declines, there will be excess dollars all around the world, triggering rampant inflation in America, as the purchasing power of each Dollar declines. There will be a currency crisis, triggering a global recession on a much larger scale compared to the 2008 financial crisis.

There is one key reason though why any of this is highly unlikely to happen, at least in the short term. There simply isn’t another currency to replace the Dollar with. There are significant issues still within the Eurozone, and although China recently joined the SDR, it has also seen a significant slowdown in growth. The US Dollar makes up 41.9% of the global reserve value under SDR, while the Chinese Yuan will make up only around 10%. The markets still view the US Dollar as risk free. The crisis in Greece occurred because investors believed the Greek Government could not afford to pay its debts, whereas if the US Government were to stop paying its debt, it would be because of unwillingness not an inability to pay. The Dollar is safe for now!

personalfinance,Getting out of debt,"I have accrued a fair amount of debt with most of it being from college.  There is also a couple of credit cards in there.  

My goal is to be debt free in 3 years, but 28k of the debt is a federal student loan at 3% so I'm not sure if I should be paying that off.

On the income side, I have a fulltime job earning roughly 36k a year, with some potential for side work in my area adding another 4k.

I want to utilize reddit for my inspiration, tips towards spare earnings, and which debt to pay down first.  

I am 34, having worked in a small but growing family business for 23 years and have a base knowledge in windows based pcs, networking, web design, and basic (not the language) programming.  I am eager to teach myself new skills that will make my spare time earning potential increase.  

I would love to know where to start in learning some programming that I can use to increase project work.

personalfinance,Student loans not due for 2 years,"I just finished my masters this September, and it was my understanding that my student loans (all federal) should become due March 2016.  I just got my first job and threw some money into my loans, and noticed that this changed the new due date to February 2017.

I'm quite sure this isn't right.  I noticed I also got an email from my university welcoming me to the new semester of college, so I wonder if they incorrectly told my loans provider that I was still enrolled.

If this is true, should I notify Navient?  I'm going to keep paying down loans every month regardless, so I'm tempted to leave it alone in case hardship makes it necessary to skip a month.  Could I get in trouble if they realise I finished school?

personalfinance,Pay off interest-bearing debt or a loan from family?,"Hi all! I (29/F) maxed out my federal student loans during my 2nd year of grad school and still didn't have enough to get by. Thankfully, my mom was able to loan me $10,000 so that I didn't have to get a private/bank loan, which was awesome. She's not rich; I believe she took it out of a retirement account (she was 61 at the time; don't know if she paid a penalty).

When I borrowed the money, I asked her when/how she wanted to be repaid. She said, ""Whenever"". I asked if she was sure, because if so, I'd pay back my interest-bearing debt first. She said that was fine. 

This past May, only a year after graduating, she asked for $2,000 and she needed it within a few months. I'm lucky to have a high salary and keep my bills low, so I was able to give her the money instead of making aggressive loan payments for a bit--and I told her that. There's no way, for example, my brother could ever come up with $2,000 in 2 months.

Anyway, to my question: I'm changing jobs and taking a pay cut in order to improve my quality of life. Also, my rent is going up. My budget is tighter this year. So, I asked my mom if she anticipated needing any payments on the loan (now $8,000) in 2016 and she said no. I still owe ~$8,500 on a Stafford loan at 5.4%. 

If you were me, would you continue to aggressively pay off the Stafford loan until it's gone? Or would you pay off mom so that you didn't run into anything unexpected again/got rid of the guilt that comes with borrowing money from family? Or split the difference?",finance,1449352822

financialindependence,Using equity in your primary residence to purchase a cheaper residence that you plan to FIRE to...thoughts?,"**Current Residence**
* ~$300k, ~$150k in Equity [after ~$45k is assumed for sale-related expenses ]

* Located in a nice city location but ultimate out of my price range for FIRE. Also, I've got no family in the area anymore.

* Financial independence, frankly, is more important to me than the friendships I have locally as they are largely work-related and only one of them is really close. The rest of my core ""friend"" group aren't local anymore and I rarely see them. Developing a new network of close friends isn't worth the effort to me at this stage, given I plan to leave the area in the next 5 years to be closer to family and my gf's family. [Even if we break up, 70% of my family is in two neighboring states I could drive and/or get $200 plane tickets to so its still a good location for me. My family isn't concentrated like hers is. Similarly, my parents are there. ]

* Relocation would cut our travel budget in half that I've been relying on /r/Churning to fund but it still costs me ~$500 a year to generate ~$2-3k in airfare. [ I only count signup bonuses largely because the per-$ bonuses are largely similar b/t cards and it wouldn't matter if I had a couple good ones or a dozen then I'm churning. ]

* Relocation would reduce hotel expenses by ~$1-2k/year [ I've largely been covering this with /r/Churning but its

**Cheaper Residence in Relocation Area**

* The main reason to do this, frankly, is I'd double my rental income without any actual additional investment in $$ and there is a house near my parents I strongly desire. [i.e. Its pretty close to the ideal location, price, square footage, acreage]

* I want to retire there, regardless of my personal relationships. [1.5 hours from mountain trails, ~3 hours from where I used to ski, ~6 hours by car or ~3 hours ( I include time to get to the airport, security, etc) by plane to visit family]

* ~$125k, with some minor improvements I can basically fund the purchase entirely on the strength of my credit and a home equity loan or a HELOC (variable interest rates aren't going to hurt me much if I'm selling in 5 years).
* My gf and I know someone we can rent to in the area given the proximity of family, etc. who can pay ~85% of market rate [ market rate meets the one percent rule and largely checks out ]. Between this and the other rental income I have from my primary residence, the HELOC and related maintenance is basically ""free"" [financing costs are ~40% of my current rental income if I include the space I use as rental]. I do charge ~85% of market rate because I've had 0 problem tenants since I've gone with that policy ~4 years ago.

* Right now I think the target area is undervalued real estate wise as it took longer to recover from 2008 than most areas and its running at 6% growth now as its finally starting to catch up to where it should be with inflation.

* Assuming I can get a remote job [ I work in IT ] that is relatively low stress, I can basically achieve my non-financial FIRE objectives whenever I change jobs. Depending on market growth, etc. this would probably be my last job change before FIRE where the amount of money I made actually mattered. [ I'm leaning towards semi-retirement at 35 where I just make enough to cover living expenses on a part time job. Assuming my investments double over the next 25 years in real terms, I'd have enough for full retirement at 60. ]",finance,1449362361

personalfinance,Credit card vs. student loan debt,"I recently started budgeting because I want to start managing my money/debt more responsibly. I currently have about 3.5k in credit card debt with an APR around 24%. I also have 32k in student loan debt from undergrad and graduate school with an APR of 4.8%. In January I am receiving around 9k (this is included in the 32k total previously mentioned) for the second half of my year-long loan. I was planning to simply repay this to the federal government, but I'm thinking about using it to pay off my credit card debt instead. I realize that on one hand this is robbing Peter to pay Paul, but I also see it as consolidating my debt at a much lower interest rate for the long run.

What do you think? Return the money to the federal government or use it to pay off my credit card debt?",finance,1449371280

personalfinance,Questions about a car loan,"Hi all, I purchased a new vehicle today and have some questions about the deal I got. Here is the back info

- purchase price is 29xxx

- first time car buyer

- credit score of 750

- low debt to income ratio

- credit history is only about two years

- bought extended warranty with vehicle which is included in price ( important later)

- have a 72 month loan @ 5.8%

- been with my credit union for 2 ish years with no issues ( no overdraft etc)

I put 3 k down, and they came back with a  6.99% rate. When I went to finance they told me if I got the service contract that they would drop it to 5.8 so I did.

My questions are:

1) I am considering going to my credit union to see if they give me a better rate. Is this a good idea?

2) the service contract is able to be cancelled within 60 days for a full refund. Can I do this and still keep the lower interest rate(assuming I don't get a better rate from my credit union) 

3) if the service contract is cancelled is the money going to go to me or the lienholder?

personalfinance,Should I pay off my half of a mortgage shared with my sister?,"First time posting! Long time lurker and PF has helped me get my finances in order. I have managed to pay off all my student loans and am debt free except for a mortgage.

I bought a house with my sister as an investment about 10 years ago. Unfortunately the house was not a good investment and is now worth about 100K less than what we paid. Here are the details:

Balance on mortgage: 141K
Interest rate: 4.99%
Monthly payment: $892 (we have renters in the house and the rental income goes directly to paying off mortgage)
Estimated value of house if relevant: $118K

I have some money saved up now and am wondering whether it would be a good idea to buy out my sister. This is my thought: pay the mortgage down by half (about 70K); each month, half of the rental income comes to me (about $450); when we sell the house, we divide it by half. 

My sister would be responsible for the rest of the mortgage.

Is this a good idea and I am missing something? I'm not looking to do anything unfair to my sister, but I like the idea of being debt free. The alternative is just to stick it in a charles schwab account or something.",finance,1449410195

I recently got a part-time job and have been paying off $3,000/month in loans since September. Once I'm done paying the loan I'm focused on now, I can pay $2,900 toward FedLoan. I don't want to wait for it to be forgiven. I just want to get rid of all my student loan debt. My payments are now set at $250 until I submit my AGI info next summer, and I know my payment amount will be increased. 

Does it look bad if I start paying $2,900/month in March if my payment is only $250?  Will it cause them to completely jack up my payments next summer just based off the $2,900 payments, or will they still just go by my AGI?

So here's the situation I'm looking at now. I took out a car loan at 5.67% (best rate I could find for a fist time car loan, would like to do better this time arround) for about $20K in May 14. Paid it down to 10K by October and paid the rest off in full yesterday. 
Now the other car in my household, the one I use for work, is dying a slow death and the Alternator has started to not work for the first few minutes it runs. The car is shot and basically work $500 at the most so I really don't think its smart to put any more money into repairs.
Ideally, I'd like to replace it with a new Honda Fit with the intent to run it into the ground. Should I hold out and try and wait till the paid off car loan is reported as closed to apply for a new loan? Or does it really not matter?

technology,I emailed my Congressman about the net neutrality killing rider that's been attached in the stopgap funding bill. His response is some of the biggest horseshit I've read in a while and I wanted to share it with you all,"My Congressman's response:

I would like to thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). I appreciate hearing about issues that are important to my constituents.
 
As you may know, net neutrality refers to the principle of the open and free internet. Under this principle Internet Service Providers (ISP) provide equal access to all lawful internet traffic, and consumers are free to choose what content they wish to access. The main focus of debate over net neutrality has been whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient for policy makers to address this issue, or whether they should look to Congress to amend current law.
 
Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was passed into law, new technologies and advancements in telecommunications have rapidly developed due to the limited government regulation of internet traffic and services. However, on February 26th, 2015, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband Internet as a telecommunication service under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This essentially allows the FCC to reclassify broadband as a utility giving the FCC more regulatory authority over Internet providers. 
 
Over the past 20 years the Internet has changed the way we live our lives, from how we get the news to how we pay our bills. Now the FCC is reaching back 80 years for their authority to reclassify broadband Internet service as a public utility, a move that will not only open the Internet up to heavier regulations and additional taxes, but would disincentive the development and deployment of faster Internet service throughout the nation. 
 
While President Obama and Chairman Wheeler continue their short sighted approach to net neutrality I hope to use my position as a member of the Communication and Technology Subcommittee to push for a bi-partisan solution that will help keep the internet open and free while incentivizing the build-out of broadband services and spurring innovation in the marketplace. The Subcommittee is currently discussing draft legislation, which I support, that would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit blocking lawful content, throttling data, and paid prioritization. Moving forward please be assured that I will keep your views in mind as we continue to work on this important issue.
 
Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. If you would like to keep up on this and other important issues you can follow me on Facebook, Twitter or sign up for my electronic newsletter.

personalfinance,Buying a new car (US),"Hi. I'm planning to buy my first car (new, 2016 model). I recently started a job and my employer has affiliations with a credit union for auto loans. I would like to know how do I go about financing my car. I've decided which car I want to purchase and have also located the nearest dealership. I've gone through KBB and Edmunds to find out about the car's performance, reviews, and fair market values. So, what's next? Do I apply for the loan before I go to the dealership or are there some other steps I should go through before that? Should I apply for the loan from the credit union affiliated with the employer or let the dealership apply for a loan for me?

I have only 1 credit card with good standing (760+ in Experian) but I don't know what kind of interest rate I would qualify for. This is also 1 of the reasons why I'm considering the credit union suggested by my employer because I may get some discounts in that case.

In addition, I'm not an American citizen and although I'm assuming I'll get a green card eventually, I'm not entirely sure about my status in the next few years. In that case, would a leasing option be better suited to my needs? I'm pretty sure I won't go over the mileage limit and keep the car in a good condition. But financially it doesn't seem like the better option out of the two. Even if I buy the car after the leasing period has ended, I may end up paying more than the price if I had financed it from the beginning.

Student Loans
Some backstory – I did not realize my college was paid almost in full through student loans my dad took out in my name until recently. I don’t think he is particularly proud of this, thus deferred them for years and years. Somehow, the deferment ended without his knowledge (I believe the emails were going to his previous employer’s email account.) and we ended up being delinquent. I recently found out about these loans in my name by becoming more interested in my financial health and looking at my credit score. Again I realize that for someone who is close to 30 this should have taken place much earlier than now. I certainly wish I could go back and be more proactive.  

Navient/Student Loans:

My dad has been overseeing this entire situation, but I have decided that I need to be more informed and take more action as I don’t feel like it’s being handled aggressively enough  - I will update when I have more information.  

Total: $34,030
 
When I call tomorrow, I also plan to ask about debt consolidation eligibility. If I am eligible, I am thinking this may be a good option. 

My parents assured me that I would never have to pay for my student loans, as they had planned on paying for my college. However, after doing some digging, I realized that the payments they are making surely don’t even cover the interest each month. They struggle with money, and now that I know these loans exist, I want to do all I can to get them taken care of.

I am looking at a house about $420k and a mortgage rate around 3.75%. I would like some help determining how much of a down payment to put against the mortgage. The down payment would be made up of the $65K from the sale of my previous home and a Margin Loan.

 The Margin Loan is against about $450k in invested assets (80%stock/20%bonds). It would be a variable interest rate based on the fed, but currently at about 2.25%. It would be paid off quarterly using dividends from the investments. Historically, this account has had an 8% annual rate of return. I understand I am borrowing from myself but I am concerned about how this will effect the future value of my assets.

personalfinance,Looking to purchase my first real car soon. Have some questions about financing and insurance.,"I'm sick of driving my old 1995 Ford around because whenever I take it to the garage there's almost always something wrong with it.  I've been setting $120 aside every two weeks for a while now and so far I've got $6,000 in a new car account.  I've looked through the consumer reports used car ratings and I've decided that I'd like to get a 2013 Honda Civic based on the overall ratings and looks of the car.  I plan to drive this car for 6+ years and I chose it due to its good gas mileage and low maintenance.  After some online shopping I've found the prices for the base LX model to range from about $14K-$15K which leaves me with $9K left to pay.
  
When I was younger my grandmother left me a savings bond when she died, and I also decided to buy one at the same time.  I should be able to cash them in for at least $1,500.  My other grandparents also bought stock that automatically reinvests dividends for all their grandchildren during the 90's.  I currently have ~$6K worth of stock in three different companies.  I'm seriously considering selling half of each and putting $3K towards my car.  This will give me about $10,500 which means I'll only need a loan of about $5,000.
  
I currently have no credit history and will need someone to cosign the loan, so I'm planning on a high interest rate.  I've decided that a 4 year loan would be best that way I'll have some money left for insurance/registration and to set up an emergency fund.
  
Is this a good plan?  Is it worth it to sell half my stocks to reduce the size of my loan?
  
Also, why does car insurance vary so much?  I'm currently on my parents insurance and I'll need to get my own once I buy my car and I've seen rates as low as $70/month up to $200/month with the same information entered.  Can I haggle with insurance companies?  If I get a quote from one place and show it to another will they try to match it?

financialindependence,REDDIT FI/RE &amp; AUS FI Q,"I have a few questions and would love your advice Personal Finance!


I have been gifted approximately - $11,000 in TLS and $7,500 worth of NAB shares (btw I’m Australian and these shares are listed on the ASX (Australian Stock Exchange). I have established a Emergency Fund of approximately $4000. Which is approximately 3-4 months of comfortable living for me.

Quick BIO - I am a 22 year old University student and won’t graduate for another 2 year. I have a reliable car and all the necessary essentials in life.
I can’t foresee myself needing a large lump of cash in next 4-5 years (at the earliest) to buy a house, etc.
Hence I would like to keep my money in the share market and put it to work! 




I do have about $25000 in university debt but in Australia you don’t need to make forced payments till you earn over $54000 (per annum) and the annual interest rate is consistently 2.5% if that.
It is likely I won’t earn a lot once I finish university and it is also likely I’ll go on to study my Masters or something else.

Now, my first question is should I sell my current shares and move them into Vanguard ETFs? My current and admittedly basic financial plan is to add consistently over time, no matter the market. Mainly through Vanguard Index Funds, a few bonds and even fewer individual share companies. This I hope will eventually lead to my FI.

If I do sell my current shares I’d be looking at buying Vanguard US Total Market Share Index ETF (VTS), Vanguard ASX 300 (VAS) , and Vanguard MSCI Index International Shares ETF (VGS). A basic lazy three way split portfolio. For now, without any bonds. My thinking being, I’m young (22) and I can ride out the market for now. What is your opinion? Perhaps this is too risky.

The reason I would sell my current shares is I have little knowledge about the companies. Though I believe they are regarded as 'blue chip’ companies. I would feel more comfortable with Vanguard Index ETFs. In order to hedge my bets better in the market.
From what Ive read picking the right shares, at the right time and well enough to cover the extra expenses of doing so (i.e. buying and selling etc) is immensely difficult. Is there anything I should keep in mind when it comes to buying and selling shares?

It is important to note I am very, very green. I have never made a trade and have only have taken an interest in the share market over the last 6 months. Keeping this in mind. I would really appreciate your advice.

Is this a sensible plan? What could I do differently?

Help me avoid wasting this big advantage I have been granted!

personalfinance,Federal Student Loans,"To begin, I am from the United States. I graduated with a bachelor's degree last spring and left school with a private loan as well as federal loans. I am now getting my master's degree in a different country. My private loan has deferred until I finish my master's, but my federal loans refuse to defer because I do not go to a university that qualifies for financial aid. I am at a loss because I have to apply for forbearance but that only lasts one year and I also need an internship, preferably a paid one, to complete my master's. Forbearance dictates that once I get a job I have to start paying back my loan, so my question is: if I get a paid internship do I have to start paying my loan and then apply for forbearance again once I finish the internship? My second question, and this is a real inquiry, is why does the government make this so difficult for me? I am getting a degree; I am a full time student; I do not have a job and am working to educate myself; why is it so difficult for me to go about postponing my loan payments? Why can't the government hold off payments just like my private loan service did? I am frustrated because before I left the country I called both of my loan providers and no one mentioned going to a ""qualifying"" school in order to get loans deferred, simply that I needed to send proof of my enrollment. The denial to defer my loans came as a shock and now I am frantically trying to figure out how to postpone loan payments while I am in school. Help me, please. Any advice?

I just got a new job that I start in January. I am going from making &lt;40k to about 80k (70k plus monthly bonus). I have about 70K in student loan debt - one is a fixed payment of 142 a month. The other I can pay either in a 10 or 25 year plan. We rent a fairly nice apartment for our area, but very much want a home of a reasonable size (3-ish bedrooms and a full basement). As far as credit cards, we have about 6 of them, none are maxed out but they are definitely used more than I am proud of. Total debt is &gt;10k, &lt;20k. We have basically no savings. Car wise, we are buying one (5 years left, 351 a month) and leasing one (just got it, 3 years, 315 a month). Some day, I want to invest but know nothing. I know less than nothing. I know less than the person who knows the least.

I know the whole ""pay off the highest interest rate within similar debt amounts first"" strategy and have been trying to follow Ramsey's snowball method, but I'd really like to own a house of reasonable size within at most 2 years if at all possible.

We have no other debt since we pay credit cards off in full monthly and drive older but reliable cars. 
We save, not nearly as much as we can but also more than many people we know.

personalfinance,16 Common /r/PersonalFinance Questions. Don't let this be you!,"Here is a list of some of the most common questions that pop up in /r/personalfinance, and the common rebuttals.  Don't let this be you!

##Emergency Funds

* **Why do I need an emergency fund? I have credit cards!**

Credit can be extended or withdrawn at any time by the card issuer, and not all emergencies are payable with credit.  You should not rely on your credit lines as an emergency fund.   

* **Should I invest my emergency fund in something with more risk/more return?  Bank account interest doesn't even keep up with inflation.**

As a general statement, no - emergency funds are best held in highly liquid, low risk accounts like savings or certificates of deposits.  The statement about inflation isn't universally true either, as the inflation rate is not steady and recently has been [quite low](http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/).  Your emergency fund is not going to make or break your retirement, so returns are a secondary concern compared to having a cushion to fall back on if things go south.  Insurance and investments don't mix, and your emergency fund is insurance.

* **Do I even need a big emergency fund?  My job is stable/nothing will ever happen to me/I'm in great health/etc.**

Everyone's job is stable until it isn't.  Nothing ever happens to anyone before something happens.  Everyone is in great health until they aren't.  Financial emergencies are unpredictable by definition, and half of a proper defense is to be prepared with an emergency fund (the other half is to be properly insured).  Nobody who has ever had to use an emergency fund regretted having one, and credit to them who checked their egos at the door and took the right stes to prepare themselves.  

##Investing

* **Do I need to speak to a financial advisor?**

You probably don't.  The vast majority of people asking this question in /r/personalfinance have simple situations that don't require any professional (expensive) advice after an hour or two of reading ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), for example).  Unfamiliarity with personal financial issues is not the same as inability to deal with them.  

* **My situation is unique, here's a wall of text explaining why.  Can you help me?**

It's probably not that unique.  Please read the information found in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq), particularly [""I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics).  You may find [Your IRA and You: Basic Information](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras) and [Your 401k and You: Basic Information](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k) worth a read as well.  Use that as a starting point and explain why your situation is different.  

* **I know I can't time the market, but should I try timing the market?**

Every time the market takes a dip we get a litany of these kinds of posts.  ""The market looks bad today because of Greece/the Fed/China/the debt ceiling/the government shutdown/whatever - should I wait to invest????""  Market timing doesn't work, not now, not ever.  You can never perfectly time your investments to coincide with local or absolute minmimums in the market, and you cannot do it consistently.  It is always the right time to invest according to your asset allocation and risk tolerance.  Trying to time the market is an exercise in futility.

* **How can I maximize my returns without any risk?**

In short, you can't.  There are no low risk, high return investments - if there were everyone would do it and eliminate the advantage.  You don't get the possibility of higher returns without taking on higher levels of risk.  If you're looking for low risk, go with a savings account, CD, or treasury.  If you're looking for the possibility of higher returns a stock market index fund may be appropriate for you.  Also note that you need to match your risk tolerance to the time frame of your investment goals.  Someone buying a house in a year should not be investing their down payment money on small cap stocks.  Someone investing for retirement in 40 years can likely not afford to be plowing their entire nest egg into a savings account.

* **I just got a cold call from my wife's cousin who works for Northwestern Mutual.  Is whole life insurance as good an investment as they make it sound like?**

Permanent life insurance is a *terrible* investment for almost everyone except the person selling it.  See the FAQ entry on [life insurance](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/insurance).  If you have a need for life insurance at all, buy term and invest the difference.  Don't get suckered into the sales pitch.

##Credit

* **Should I keep a small balance on my credit cards to build credit?  I heard from a friend/coworker/relative that you have to in order to build credit.**

This is completely false.  If you are using your credit cards properly you are paying off your bills **in full, every month, no exceptions.**  You do not need to pay a *single cent of interest* to build a great credit score.

* **CreditKarma says my score dropped 5 points, what should I do???**

CreditKarma is a simulated credit score and a drop of 5-50 points is virtually meaningless.  Stop worrying about your credit score.  If you are paying your bills off **in full, every month, no exceptions** by the statement due date you are doing things right, and your score will gradually improve.  Ignore short term, small scale fluctuations.

* **Will my credit score take a dive if I go over 30% utilization????**

Stop worrying about your utilization ratio.  Utilization has no memory and takes one billing cycle to reset.  If you are paying your bills off **in full, every month, no exceptions** by the statement due date you are doing things right.

* **I have enough money to pay off my debts.  Should I pay them off slowly to build my credit history/improve my credit score?**

You should never extend the life of any loan just because you think it is going to help your credit score.  Great credit scores can and should be built for free.  You may decide to delay paying down a loan in full if the interest rate is low enough.  See [""I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), step 3.

##Banking

* **Should I join a Credit Union instead of a bank?**

Credit unions are not inherently better than banks, and banks are not inherently worse than credit unions.  The bottom line is you should decide on the banking services you need (Need a large ATM network?  A bank is probably better.  Great customer service in a certain locale?  Maybe a CU is better) and go with whatever banking institution offers them for the lowest cost.  For basic services both credit unions and banks are pretty much the same.

* **I signed up for something but now I'm being held to terms and conditions I didn't know about.  Is this legal?**

Yes, it is legal for a company to enforce the terms and conditions you agreed to yet might not have read thoroughly.  You should always read any agreements you sign for pitfalls.  One of the most common is the clause in the 0% interest promotional periods that says if you miss a payment or haven't paid down the balance in full by the end of the promotion period, you will be charged back interest.

##Taxes

* **Is it even worth working overtime or getting a raise?  It will put my in the next tax bracket.**

Tax brackets are marginal, meaning only the amount above the threshold is taxed at the higher rate.  You never net less money by earning more.

* **I got a bonus, why was it taxed at over 40%""??!""**

No, 40% of your bonus was *withheld.*  See [taxes withheld vs. actual tax burden](http://redd.it/2ub719).  Your bonuses are not taxed any differently than your normal income, but they may be withheld differently.  You can either wait until tax time to settle with the IRS, or use the [IRS Withholding Calculator](http://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/) to determine if you need to submit a new W-4 to your employer to change your withholdings.

I probably forgot some, but these are the posts I find myself answering over and over again.

##User-suggested additions:

* **I make minimum wage and have no credit. Can I afford a 40K car?**

No.  Even if you could, new cars are extremely efficient wealth-destroyers.  Consider a used car you can actually afford instead of a new one that you can't.  (/u/lava_lice)

* **My bankrupt relative wants me to cosign. Should I do it?**

Cosigning a loan makes you liable to pay in the event that the original signer cannot.  The creditor is saying that the borrower is not trustworthy enough to be extended a loan on their own, and they need additional guarantees that their loan will be repaid.  If you're OK with being on the hook for all of your relative/friend's debt, go for it.  In general this is an absolutely terrible idea.  (/u/lava_lice)",finance,1449520501

personalfinance,Is claiming exempt on feds good idea to get out of debt?,"tl;dr: Took out high interest installment loans that is eating up 50% of monthly income. Instead of getting another job, plan on filing exempt (no taxes taken out for 6 months), taking hit to credit by not paying loans for two-three months, and paying loans back in bulk after saving enough money to pay them off.

So here is the backstory... I took out a couple of high interest installment loans a few months back because of dumb decisions and personal reasons. I am currently paying over 50% of my monthly income paying back these three loans while the other 50% of my income (not including this 50%) already goes to paying rent, car insurance, car bills, gas, student loans, cell phone bill, utilities, and monthly subscriptions to Netflix, Spotify, and Hulu. This leaves me 0% to pay for monthly eating expenses, unexpected car expenses, and saving.

These high interest loans will not be fully paid off until two years from now due to the amount of interest that incurs daily. (roughly 125%)

I am starting a new job next week with a decent pay increase but still not enough to make extra payments on these loans and live comfortably. I had worked a second job for the last year as a server but it severely affected my job performance and I needed to quit to save my sanity! (Props to the people that work 2-3 jobs 70-80 hours a week. Real MVP's)

I calculated my finances and I determined that by claiming exempt on my federal and state income taxes at my new job for six months, this will create enough extra income to pay off these loans and my credit card debt. I would of course need to stop paying these loans altogether and just use the extra money to save it and pay them off entirely once I can. (I can save enough each month to pay off one loan every month and a half) This will hurt my credit but I figure I am young enough to take a credit hit and then build it back up. (I am 23)

The problem with claiming exempt is paying Uncle Sam next year. But I'd rather pay Uncle Sam at a much lower interest rate than pay these loans out and be forced to work a second job just to survive. (Which is what I was doing for the last 6 months or so).

I also plan on resubmitting my W-4 form and withhold double the normal taxes after May to help balance out my negative tax balance for the 2016 tax year.",finance,1449522081

**Credit Scores**: Both are **above 750**, we have zero “monthly recurring debt”

**Combined Savings:** $25k (Me) + $75k (Her) = **$100k** 

**Investment Portfolio - 401K**: $78k (Me w/ 10% monthly deposit), $65k (Her w/ 20-25%) = **$143k**

Note:  She’ll have to find a new job, so I’m not exactly sure what her new salary will be, though I’m hoping that her experience at two different S&amp;P 500 companies and her newly awarded MBA will help land her a comparable or better job. 

**Buying vs. Renting**

So, after individual taxes, insurance, 401k, etc… Our **combined net salary = $8k**
I’ve calculated our **monthly expenses (e.g. utilities, food, gas, going out, safety net, etc) = $2.1-2k**
Which leaves us with about **$6k / month for housing &amp; savings**

**Buying:**  The problem is that even with $100k in savings and being First Time Homebuyers, I can only see us using $60k ($40k safety net) towards a down payment.  With that, we won’t be able to meet the 20% down payment required for a **house in our price range $610k (+/- $40k)**.  So for a loan amount of $550k ($610k-$60k), I did some rough PMI estimates and calculated we’d pay almost $20k in PMI over 7 years, which REALLY bothers me.  What bothers me even more is how much of your mortgage payment goes to the interest (vs principle), but that’s an entirely different story.  All things house related (mortgage, property tax, insurance, PMI, safety net) would be about $3.3k / month, allowing us to still save $2.7k. But, I just feel like going this route (buying) would just be throwing money away. I also read somewhere that housing costs should not exceed 28%, but I don’t know if that’s just mortgage or everything combined (mortgage + taxes + insurance + pmi +etc). Also, I don’t really know if that’s gross income or net income.

**Renting:** So, say we rent for a year or so after she moves here, move into a 2br/2ba apartment, with a budget of $2.5k for an apartment, we’d save roughly $3.5k month and could possibly end up with an extra $42k to use for our down payment. This would bring our Total Savings to $142k, where we’d keep $30k and use $112k as a down payment.  Calculated PMI for this would be about $3k over the course of 1 year, which I can live with. I’m reducing what I said I wanted to keep in savings by $10k, but I can live with that as well.  This would then bring my monthly housing cost to $3.2k, allowing us to still save about $2.6k-$2.8k per month, leaving a little wiggle room for house maintenance.

Ok… with all that said…

**Q1:  Should we rent for a year and save money towards a future down payment?**

**Q2:  Our savings are sitting in savings accounts, is there an investment strategy to move it to in account for just one year and make more money off of interest? Like a bond, but with a higher interest rate?**

If you’re read this far, you are more patient than I can be, so congratulations on that.  If you have anything that can help us in making this decision, I greatly appreciate it.

personalfinance,"I settled $27,000 in IRS debt dating back to 2006 for $325 without the need for an attorney!","This post is not meant to brag but to be of use and hope for people who may be in a similar situation as me. If you feel burdened by your circumstances, you can change your life around! 

I won't go into too many specifics about my past but, basically, I accumulated lots of IRS debt that I was unable to pay off primarily because I was hired as a 1099- Independent Contractor and therefore had to pay my own taxes at once (vs. having them automatically deducted from every paycheck as a W2 employee would). However, when the tax bill came, the money to pay wasn't there, since it was not taken out directly with each paycheck. This happened throughout my 20s and I have learned my lesson since. Not only do I need to pay more individual taxes as a 1099 vs. W2 but I also had to pay for my own health insurance and forget about retirement benefits. Oh, and when I was ""laid off"" no unemployment either. So, this ends my side rant about the b.s. that is the ""1099 employee."" I was living paycheck to paycheck already, and most of my money was going toward rent, food, and basic living expenses, much less to save 20% towards taxes. But in the end, I rest responsibility 100% with myself for getting into the situation I was in. 

Here is the breakdown of the unpaid taxes by year (including penalties and interest as of the end of 2014):

*2006: [$2,328.59](http://i.imgur.com/XMvqy7Z.png)

*2009: [$2,219.62](http://i.imgur.com/BQPjRjD.png)

*2013: [$843.85](http://i.imgur.com/tUgKQKL.png)

Total owed: $27,149.10

I also had a federal lien placed on my property (the only property I own is an 11 year old car). Because of this, I was getting mailers left and right from tax lawyers who promised me to wipe off my debt for pennies on the dollar if I would just hire them for a $1,000+ retainer. I even had one lawyer who said that it couldn't be done, that I was young and healthy and the IRS would never work with somebody like me.

But it can be done without the need for lawyers. Here is what I did:

**IRS form 656** [Offer In Compromise](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Offer-in-Compromise-1)

This is the form you need to start with. This is for individual as well as business debt. I don't know the whole logistics about business OIC because I filed for individual. 

You will need to use the [OIC Pre- qualifier tool](http://irs.treasury.gov/oic_pre_qualifier/) to determine your eligibility first off. It will ask you several simple questions. This doesn't mean that you will automatically be approved, however. It just gets your foot in the game. 

*You must have ALL tax years returns filed! Make sure every year has been filed and is on record with the IRS!*

**What helped me get approved** was that my income has been very limited for the past few years. I'm talking $15,000 or less every year. Yes, if I made $50,000 a year and tried to get my debt settled, I'm sure they would laugh in my face. So if you owe a lot to the IRS and have no assets and little income, you have a huge advantage. I have been looking for full time work this whole time, realizing that the city I live in and the college degree I earned did not mesh well and there was not much opportunity for me. I am currently going back to school for a computer science degree and excited for a career in IT next year! 

I also sent in a signed letter by my therapist, who I had been seeing for a couple of years due to anxiety and depression (a lot of it caused by tax and debt burdens!) so any type of medical documentation you can append will help your case as well. 
I also started budgeting better and taking care of my debts and paid my taxes on time in 2014. I made less than $15,000 so it wasn't much, but I think this may have helped persuade them in their decision, as I am really turning things around and acting in good faith.

I sent off my form 656 paperwork on June 22, 2015 and received the approval and response on Dec. 1, 2015. Let them do their thing, they will get back to you. 

I offered them $325 (with help from the pre- qualifier tool) to settle my outstanding debt and they accepted!! The tax lien is being removed from my records and I do not need to worry any more about my bank accounts being garnished! I can now start my life fresh while learning my lesson to never get myself into debt like that again!

*note that if you ever fall behind again in the future, they will rescind the offer and you will owe all the back taxes plus penalties and interest for all those years. Don't fall back into the trap!*

[My acceptance letter from IRS](http://i.imgur.com/FJG4YnM.png)

Yes I realize that I am going to receive a lot of negativity about being a deadbeat. I accept responsibility for my life which I believe is the first step to transformation. But I also believe in second chances and I am truly grateful to the IRS for unleashing me from this burden. I hope that this post inspires others in a similar situation to take charge of their own fate and to realize that a debt free life is within your control!",finance,1449524606

I'll be starting a Co-op (6 month internship) with Fermilab in a month or so and I found that they offer a 403b plan which has no vesting time and no other eligibility requirements. 

more about the plan here https://nb.fidelity.com/public/nb/fermilab/planoptions/plandetails?planId=51801&amp;option=planBasics

I'm going to be working 6 months out of the year for either the next 2 or 3 years in this position making about $20/hr to start. Therefore, I can expect to make about 16.5-18k per year after taxes, or about 1500 per month total.

**debt:** I have one federal student loan of about $3k right now (I was planning to pay this off as quickly as possible during my co-op -- the rate is like 6%). For the duration of my co-op, Fermilab will pay my tuition/fees/books for me, so i dont think i will be incurring any significant expense from school for the duration of my undergrad. nothing else other than credit cards which I pay in full each month

**expenses**:

rent: $158 (yes, $158)

utilities: $60

food: $150-200

misc: $50-75

this leaves me with approx. $1k per month to do whatever I choose with. I already have an emergency fund of about $3k. As far as I can tell, there's no employer matching option for me (Fermilab's 401a is 10% contribution automatically (!) but requires 2 years of service and age 21 which im not) but, given that my current tax rate is quite low, the roth 403b option seems like a good idea.",finance,1449532625

Later that day, the competitor calls me up and offers me a $150K raise, I was previously making about $120K.  So, naturally I took it.  The firm was new and they asked me if I would start as a 1099 as it would be easier for them to get their finances in order, no problem.  Huge raise, I took it.

Since then the price of the condo has doubled, and I decided to go out for a mortgage. After all I have an +800 credit score, few debts, my company is very generous with my expense account, company car, etc..  Living good.

personalfinance,Need some help regarding debt between myself and my boyfriend,"Throwaway so my real account isn't connected to this.  

My boyfriend is American and I live in Melbourne, Australia. He has been working here the past year making $60k (versus the $30k he earned in the US) . I will be graduating from a law degree in 2016. 

We met a few years ago and this is the first year we've actually been able to spend fully together and got a little over excited with spending - lots of holidays, time off etc etc. Both of us are generally speaking financially savvy minus the splurging in the past year. 

He currently has an $80k debt for his American college degree (Inc masters) and I will have approx $50k when I finish next year. His loans are all federal loans and he was making minimum payments in the States but upped it when he started earning more here.  The Australian system is a little different in that my student loan only rises with inflation, no other interest and I only am expected to pay when I earn more than around $60,000 p.a. 

He recently had his visa approved for permanent migration here and has already been offered a job, with salary expectations around the $70k mark. Law graduates in Australia currently have an average starting salary of $52k (though the grad market is quite saturated so actually attaining a job is the difficult part, so my salary is merely speculative).  

We want to settle down and rent an apartment (around $2000 per month) and begin to reduce the debts significantly. At the same time we would like to start saving for a house deposit about six years down the track, as well as have the capability to start a family. During thos savings period we would still like to enjoy ourselves, with an overseas trip once a year and perhaps a ticket home every now and then to see his family.

investing,Should I Pay Off my Student Loan Debts First or Invest in an Index Fund?,"I am an Albertan currently about $8,000 in debt from student loans. Roughly $5,500 of this $8,000 is an Alberta Student Loan, while the rest ($2,500) is from the National Student Loans Service Centre (Canadian Student Loan). I think that the $5,500 will have an interest rate of approximately 3% per year, while the NSLSC loan charges approximately 5% interest per year.

Now, I recently invested into the VOO vanguard S&amp;P 500 index fund. I also researched that the average return on investment on the S&amp;P 500 is approximately 10% per year (so long as you keep the investment in for 30 years or more).

So, I currently have about $7000 in cash, which I could use to pay off my student loan debt, or put it into the VOO fund.

The way I see it, if I did not pay off the loan for 41 years, it would grow to about $35541.17. As well, if I put the 7000 into VOO and let it sit for 41 years, it would grow to $316814.78. I would then have a profit of about $281273.60.

It seems to me if I used the $7000 to instead pay off my debt now, I would be making the more ""foolish"" decision. However, I may be missing something, since everyone around me seems to think paying off one's student debts are always a financial priority greater than investing.

Additional information: I am also going back to university for another 4 years to pursue a degree in commerce, which will total to another $30,000 in loan debt.

   Thank you for contacting me about Net Neutrality and internet usage issues.  I always appreciate the opportunity to hear from my fellow Georgians. 

  On February 26, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued new rules for broadband to replace the regulations shot down by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year.  These new regulations represent radical change from the openness policy that previously guided the Internet and encouraged innovation and creativity to flourish.   

   FCC authority for these rules was derived from an early twentieth century utilities act, inspired by pressure from the President, and developed under a shroud of secrecy.  Not only is this not how the Internet should be regulated, this is not how the Framers of the Constitution intended the legislative process to work.  

  If Congress, due to the FCC's overreach, develops clear statutory authority, it is my opinion that any legislation should take great pains to ensure the innovative environment of the Internet is not inhibited by laborious rules and regulations.  As my colleagues and I look at options to address these issues, I will certainly keep your thoughts in mind.

investing,Everyone here needs to get familiar with something called Monero and Cryptonote. Even as cryptocurrency moves out of the nerd's basement - the greatest crypto-asset has yet to begin its ascent.,"If you know me, you will know that I have spent years studying and reading about money.  In my stock trading days, I made some good picks and enjoyed the support and arrogance of many members of this community.  But honestly?  I've made the most progress while learning about the *nature* of money itself.  
  
I've spent the last 2+ years reading about cryptocurrencies non-stop.  I also have been pretty dead-on as far as bitcoin adoption in the past few years.  
  
So let me take a moment and tell you that the next 'big' thing may not be bitcoin at all, but it's overlooked (and secretly more attractive sister).  
  
This is a subject that could fill a book but I'll outline several key points to pique your interest in hopes you'll do your own DD.  It's not too hard to actually own Monero, but I'm not here to pump up something I already own - I hope that you will do the research and come to the same conclusion that I have: the ascent of crypto is inevitable, as is the ascent of Monero.  
  
**Critical Point #1:**  The financial sector is rife with talks of the 'blockchain'.  But you simply cannot separate the blockchain from bitcoin, as much as Goldman Sachs and Blythe Masters would like to.  This is the foolish equivalent of Russia claiming they don't like the internet so they are committing themselves to building their *own* internet.  
  
Bitcoin is an open-source network, and with any open-source and decentralized financial network things are proceeding as they should - often chaotic with many surges and crashes on the way to ultimate stability (which occur at a much higher price point than now).  
  
**Critical Point #2**: Bitcoin is remarkable in that it advanced money in a very real way beyond what was currently possible but it is *not* the holy grail of digital money that many computer scientists and economists had dreamed of.  
  
Consider the following chart:  http://postimg.org/image/aqjmkgusp/  
  
- We had decentralized and private money for thousands of years with gold.  
- The 'digital dollar' gave us digital and private money (to some degree - banks and processing institutions still had to track you to process your money).  
- Bitcoin came along gave us digital money that no entity owned for the first time but at a cost: everyone can browse every bitcoin transaction back to the beginning of time.  This is obviously unsuitable as a default behavior of a currency - privacy must be built-in, it cannot be some optional add on feature.  Imagine having to obscure every sensitive credit card transaction you make so that it wouldn't be totally public knowledge.  
- Monero (as the largest and most successful implementation of the Cryptonote protocol) emerged from anonymous sources in 2014.  It is not some stock, or some silly nerd toy.  It is no less than the *holy grail of digital money itself* combining for the first time in human history the elements of digital, decentralized, and private.  
  
How does it do this?  By way of something called ""cryptographic ring signatures"".  You can either trust the egg heads who designed it that it works like magic, or develop the ph.D level mathematical knowledge to verify it yourself.  Either way, know this is likely one of the most sophisticated computational objects our species has ever created.  
  
Not only that but it also improves many fundamental aspects of Bitcoin:  
  
- Not happy that Bitcoin is deflationary?  Monero has a small perpetual tail emission that means that miners will always have more Monero to mine.  (after the initial 18.4 million, approximately 400k per year will be minable in perpetuity)  
- Not happy with the blocksize debates raging across the Bitcoin landscape?  Monero uses a variable size blocksize and a per-kb fee so that those debates will never happen on this blockchain.  
- Worried about total privacy being banned by the law (and more likely the IRS)?  Well Monero has **two** keys.  One is a private key that lets you spend your money, and the other is a view key that lets you (or another trusted party) view your balance without actually giving them access to spend it.  
  
This is not a stock, or a commodity.  This is not some get rich scheme (although many will get rich in the coming years on it).  This is nothing less than the new dominant form of money for our entire global civilization.  
  
And you are one of the very lucky few who just learned about it first.  
  
The future will be filled with anonymous money transactions whizzing through the internet at the speed of light, instantly and with no one's permission.  The fees will be a micro-fraction of what are being paid today, and it will be just like the birth of the internet all over again.  
  
This is the 2020's staring you in the face, folks.  
  
Don't be left behind: Educate yourself.  
  
Yes, Monero are only 30 to 60 cents each at the moment, and yes if they succeed in becoming the dominant private financial network on Earth then that per-unit price will likely go to some absurd number that you wouldn't believe if I told you.  You probably wouldn't have believed that 50 cent bitcoins in 2011 would be worth over $1000 by 2014, but it still happened.  
  
That's not the point though - to create a brand new, decentralized financial network from nothing you have to make a few people rich.  There is no other way to do it.  The point is that the future of finance is in cryptography and blockchains and you need to either understand it or retain the talent that does if you hope to continue to be a relevant player over the next 20 years.  
  
If you have any serious inquiries about Monero or blockchains, I will be happy to answer them here and you are always welcome to join us over on /r/monero for more talk about Cryptonote or our project.  If you were one of the one's who scoffed at Bitcoin (like I did) in 2009 - 2012 even as it began it's meteoric ascent, this is your moment of redemption.  
  
Let's not make the same mistakes.

nuclear,Bernie sanders wants a moratorium on nuclear power,"Begin a moratorium on nuclear power plant license renewals in the United States. Bernie believes that solar, wind, geothermal power and energy efficiency are proven and more cost-effective than nuclear – even without tax incentives – and that the toxic waste byproducts of nuclear plants are not worth the risks of the technology’s benefit. Especially in light of lessons learned from Japan’s Fukushima meltdown, Bernie has also raised questions about why the federal government invests billions into federal subsidies for the nuclear industry. We can have an affordable carbon-free, nuclear-free energy system and we must work for a safe, healthy future for all Americans.

personalfinance,Amortizing or investing (SWE),"So here's my situation.

I took out a government student loan during my studies, currently around (500 000 SEK). A while after I was awarded a scholarship for 225 000 SEK that I am now considering whether or not to amortize or to invest.

Interest rates on government student loans is 1% which is why I am considering investing as I am somewhat experienced in it as well as dividend yield alone is a lot higher than 1%. What worries me however is the compound interest on my loan as the absolute amount is larger than what I would be investing.

How would you guys tackle this? I seem to lean toward investing but would love any input in case I missed considering something.

personalfinance,"I'm 21, moving to California next year. What's the best course of action to fund one year at school?","So long-time lurker here. As I'm preparing for my first big step in to the 'real' world, I wanted seek the advice of this wonderful sub on the best way to finance it.

So background first, I'm 21. I have no debt and very little credit (never had a credit card). Virtually no assets (car, home, ect.) either. I've only attended one semester of college and no other kind of schooling since. In March I moved back in with my Father and have been living there for these 9 months to save money. I work 40 hours a week at Four Diamond hotel as a valet/bellhop/concierge at $8.75/hr + tips. 

I spent this year working out my game plan for the next 3 to 6 years of my life essentially. This summer I discovered where I want to go and what I want to do. There is a trade school in North Hollywood, California that offers a one-year program for music production. I took a trip down to LA in September to visit and made up my mind on the spot that it's where I wanted to be. I've since applied and been accepted to start classes in April. I'm blessed and couldn't be more excited to start pursuing my dream full-time, but of course, I've encountered some road blocks. 

Upon getting accepted it was time to start exploring financing options. The school's program is $24,000 for one year and doesn't participate in federal aid programs. My family can't afford to pay in full and neither can I. So I explored options for private student loans and not a single institution offering student loans lists my school. So I contacted the school (who does not have financial aid department) and was informed that they do not participate in any sort of loan programs since the price is fairly low and the school a non-profit institution. However, as long as they receive the money, they don't care if its from the student or a third party. So I looked into private loans, and not a single bank allows you to use loaned funds to pay for post-secondary education or trade school. 

So where's the loophole? I asked a friend of mine who's currently attending and he told me most kids there are having their parents pay for it. However, there are some that save enough to pay out of pocket as the school offers a monthly payment plan (~$1500/month). This place is my dream and even some reputable alumni are already supporting me. So I don't have any intention of giving up even if I may have to delay my start. 

Currently my plan is still to move out to LA in the Spring in hopes of building a network and seeking high-paying employment to save for school. I have a few friends down there I will be moving in with. I have roughly $3000 saved up for the initial move. I have hopes that I will be able to find a decently-paying job as a valet at some high-end establishments in town, seeing as I have Four Diamond experience. I also won't have a car so I don't need to worry about insurance, gas, ect. Essentially my only expenses will be my phone bill, food, and rent. 

I reckon I need to make roughly $30-35k a year to pull it off. I understand that LA is an expensive place to live, so what are some tips to help me make and save enough to pay tuition out of pocket through the monthly payment plan? Any advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated!

**tl;dr - Accepted to my dream school, need $24,000 for tuition and school doesn't participate in any sort of loan programs. How can I budget my finances to make &amp; save enough to pay out of pocket ($1,500/month) on top of living expenses?**

personalfinance,Grad school or bust?,"I am currently about 6 months into my first full time position having graduated University this past May. My question however pertains to  grad school (Law school). I am currently employed at a health care compliance law firm and was looking to attend law school with a focus on health care law. 

That being said however, I currently owe a little over $22,00 in student loans with fairly low interest rate and was looking to pay off around $400 a month. Now to my question and sorry if it seems like i'm rambling, but is law school a good idea in terms of my financial situation? Should I pay off my other loans first or just go to grad school and have a higher salary upon graduation and tackle all my loans then? 



I discussed this idea with a partner at the firm and he would even allow me to go part-time working so I could go to school full time and be done in 3 years. The school does offer part-time classes on weekends but I feel like that may be a lot between work and school and trying to maintain grades but am open to the idea. 



However, I would need to take out more loans and law school is about 35,000 a year. I feel as if this sector of law is growing and I would be able to return full time to work here at the firm or another consulting company upon graduation with a much higher salary.

personalfinance,Emergency fund vs debt question,"I've got a question about taking on more debt for the sake of building an emergency fund.  My inclination is that it shouldn't be done, but am curious as to what people here will have to say about it.

I will have to take on more debt to pay tuition next semester, but not much (probably 5k).  But here's the question, I could take on more debt than that because my loan amount far exceeds tuition, but have a job and am totally capable of taking care of myself without the loan (not including the cost of tuition).  So my question is - should I take more of the loan than I need, for the sake of building an emergency fund.

More details: I have about 1.5k in my emergency fund already and am still building it, $800 in checking, and 1.5k in an IRA.  My current loan is an unsubsidized federal loan at roughly 4% which I've already paid about $1,000 off of.

Federal employee, married, two young children. I'm not MENSA material, but I'm no dolt either. 



Current health insurance is going up by over $500 this year. As far as I can tell, for no increase in coverage. We were not unhappy, but also not pleased with our insurance the last two years, but a catastrophic accident and the birth of two kids planted me firmly in the ""we're not changing anything in the middle of this"" mindset. So now, here it is, open season, and my family is shopping around. 



We know a few things 

* First, our current FSA option sucks; it's so cumbersome that it's not worth my time. It's literally money thrown away because I can't get reimbursed through their online program for anything without it going through two different rejections and having to write a statement for each item. A single $2 bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide, submit the receipt, picture of the label, address of the store purchased at .. rejected. More back and forth, submitting screenshots of bank statements with purchases notated, finally accepted. Sweet, only took me 2+ hours to get my $2 back - NOT worth the time, especially not when extrapolated to a hundred or so purchases. Co-pays, large bills, even those are a headache to get back. Watched hundreds of dollars just disappear last year unused from the FSA.. So, we'd like to shift to a high deductible HSA-eligible plan; I'd really like to just have a card in my wallet we only swipe for medical related expenses - that's something we can manage easily. 

* Next, I'd like to look into invisalign/ braces to fix some issues I wish my parents had when I was younger. 

* After that, my wife would like to look at Lasik. If not that, then her best options for good vision coverage. 

* Most importantly, we don't want to have to worry about walking into the ""wrong"" doctor's office if one of our kids has an emergency.  




Just got back from my employer's ""health fair"" (30+ reps packed into 600ish sq. ft.) and could not be more disappointed. I pulled my benefits statements before going over so I'd know what I'm currently covered for and paying in co-pays etc. thinking ""this will make it easy, I'll just go down the list and see who offers what!"" Wrong. There's an exception to everything. 




So here I am, a gigantic pile of brochures in front of me that you need a background in analysis to decipher, trudging through OPM's plan comparison tool. And I'm mad. Mad that none of these pamphlets are formatted the same. Mad that they use different measures and terms for the same services. Mad that they're nigh impossible to ""side by side."" Mad that no one can explain why my premium is going up so much for no new benefits. Mad that even trying to understand the difference between ""basic option"" and ""standard option"" is eye-bleedingly tedious. Mad that the reps can't answer questions about levels of coverage compared to their competitors, but can bring up no less than five times that they ""cover 52 therapeutic massage visits per calendar year!"" It almost feels deliberate - the difficulty here in trying to decide what's best for my family's health. 




The best response and info I've been able to get are from co-workers enrolled in other plans ... ""what did you pay for this, where did you go for that"" etc. etc.\



I'm frustrated. This is a major deal for me. I have worked hard to be in a position to provide for my family (we're single income and I'm also the benefits provider) but can't understand it all.

personalfinance,Private Student Loan - Variable vs. Fixed ? Also general background on my financial status that I'd like some (gentle) general advice (Debt) (Acceptable Risks?),"I am trying to finish off my bachelor's. I am taking 12 credit hours and if everything goes well I will be done in May. I am 26, work one full time job and one part time job. I'm generally unhappy where I am at in life and getting this knocked out would be a huge weight off my shoulders. Up until this point I have had no student loans. 

So here's the run down. I applied to Sallie Mae for a student loan in the amount of $7500. Although it is likely that I won't use the full amount to pay for school fees, I wanted a cushion to cover books, travel costs to and from school and any other miscellaneous needs I might have. I have the option of a fixed interest rate loan at 5.75% or a variable rate loan of 2.25%. I would choose the option to pay interest while I am enrolled, but I would probably pay more than is needed. Which do I choose? I'm not sure I could pay off the $7500 loan in a year, but certainly in two years would be doable. 

Other pertinent information:
Full time job salary: $32,000
Savings(5k of which is emergency fund):$7,100
Debt: $5,600 (Two credit cards, this is money spent on previous semester at school primarily. Plan to have down to $4600 by the time I start school in late January)
401k: $6,300 (Currently I am putting away 9% of my income into  my retirement. I will probably pull back at the beginning of the year to just what I need to get employer match (6.5%) and put the difference towards paying off Debt. 
Life Ins. Face Value: $30,0000 (Whole life policy, plan to never touch it but it adds to financial picture I guess)

I own my car, which I paid off this past spring after having the loan for two years. I keep a spread sheet of my monthly expenses and monitor them pretty closely. I have $100 deducted from each paycheck so that it automatically ends up in my 'Don't touch' savings account.  I rent in the town I work in and will be commuting to classes about 45 minutes.  I would appreciate if anyone would feel like doing a (gentle) critique of my finances and offering advice on school, etc. Like I said, I'm generally quite unhappy with life and know I am capable of much more. I get tired of having to be the responsible one all the time and I'd like a bit of joy in life. (Finally) Finishing my degree and moving on from a dead end office job would greatly enhance my outlook on life.

then my credit improved and i got a Visa with them with a 1% reward. with the help of [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com) i've been able to manage this card properly, and it's a PIF card. i'm using the reward as a back-door savings method for a goodie i want. last month i ran over $1500 on the Visa, and paid zero interest.

today, Capital One sent me an offer that added a 1.5% reward to the crappy MC. so here's the status now.

the MC has a small annual fee, but the difference in the reward will easily make that up, since i use the card for *everything,* and i would be paying it at least as long as it held a balance anyway.

personalfinance,"Drowning in debt; school, bank, and medical bills need help","So I’ve gotten myself into really miserable trouble financially.  I don’t know what to do.  I should have come here a long time ago.  I know this is my fault and I’ve severely fucked myself.

I’ll try to outline all the details and answer questions the best I can.

I’m a 33 y/o graduate student.  I’ve reached my lifetime max for federal student loans, but the office of Financial Aid here at school says I can apply for Grad Plus Loans.  I was hoping that I could use those to pay for summer (last semester) and fall ( this semester) and spring (upcoming semester).  I have an about 3.5k outstanding tuition bill with my school.  If I don’t pay it in full, they won’t lift my registration hold for Spring.

In terms of my month to month situation, I’ve been spinning plates, but meeting things paycheck to paycheck, mostly.  This summer, my boss forgot to submit my contract which put me behind on everything, and I had to borrow money to get by.
If I can stay a student, I can make about 1600/month by teaching and keeping my research job (if my contract is renewed, and I can’t guarantee it will because of the uncertainty of the department).

I currently owe my bank $16.5k for a revolving student line of credit.  Since I was delinquent frequently enough, they closed it and turned it into a loan.  I had been playing phone tag with the loan guy, and left him a voicemail that I had a check I could deposit to pay the amount he wanted at the time, but that I wanted to be sure that was the best way to do it- would he please apply my member rewards points to pay down the total, skip payments, etc, and would the money be able to go directly to the payment without being diverted.  He didn’t answer my voicemail, and later in the week, sent me an email saying I didn’t make the deposit I said I would so he froze my bank account.  When my monthly payroll was deposited, I couldn’t transfer it to make his payment or pull my rent money.  The frozen account probably doesn’t look good for considering me for Grad Plus loans either, which I had told him was my plan to get caught up. In order to get him to unfreeze the account so I could pay him, I had to promise him $400/month on the loan alone.  He said the next step was getting collections and lawyers involved, and freezing/closing my account with them all together.

I also owe about 14k on one credit card and 1.5k, I think, on another credit card, each with a monthly payment of about $75.
All of this on top of utilities, rent, and groceries.

Another concern is that I had medical bills from breaking a bone this summer.  I didn’t have health insurance, so I was taken in as “Self-pay.”  I can’t pay, so I figured I’d pay when I could.  I got some letters from a collections agency.  The hospital has passed it along to them.  The letters say they want just over $600, and that amount may grow as interest and penalties accumulate.  Right after I got the letters I got a phone call from the collections people.  When I asked about the vague mention of interest and penalties with no figures and timelines, they said it gathers 10% interest DAILY.  I didn’t even know that was legal.  I didn’t admit to anything and told the caller that I’d have to check with the business office, and that I would send them a letter disputing the figures.
I have about a hundred dollars in the bank right now, before ~$75 for electricity.  I’ll get one more paycheck, at the end of December.  And then I don’t know if I’ll be working in January because I don’t know if I’ll still be a student.  I’m getting my CV updated and going to send that out.  I’m worried that no matter how good of a job I get, it won’t be soon enough or pay enough to save me.

What do I do?

personalfinance,"23yo, UK, need to move out, need advice","Right, please bear with as I'm on mobile (: 

Hi. I'm 23 years old, living in the uk with my mother. For reasons I won't go into I need to move out of my home, I'd like to do it with a friend to share the burdens but it's no going to be possible due to reasons beyond my control. 

I'm struggling to find a way to be able to afford to move out, even with the wage I am making, I'll go onto my outgoings further down. 

The price for a 1 bed flat is around £480/month including gas, electric and water, or a 2 bed house is around £475 not including any bills. 

For the area of the UK I live in, I'm making pretty good money, I'm on 27.5k a year basic, my pay breakdown is this

Hourly rate - £10.39
Night shift allowance - £25/night

I work 5 night a week and a total of 39 hours for a basic week. Overtime is sometimes available and is paid at 1.5x

Last month I took home £1923 after tax which included some overtime. 

My outgoings are as follows:

Car payment - £323
Lodge - £300/month
Barclyard card CC - £100/month (Balance £600, 0% apr until June 16) 
HSBC CC - £50/month (Balance £1500, just done a balance transfer from Barclyard, 36 months 0% APR.)
Car insurance - £44/month
Mobile phone - £44/month
Spotify - £4.99/month 

Then on top of this I have general outgoings such as petrol around £80 a month, eating out around £40 a month.

The biggest thing I regret is leasing my car, if I wasn't so stupid I wouldn't have got it but I'm stuck in a contract until August 2017, there's no way I can get out of it so I just have to deal with it.

I'm not so worried about my credit cards as they're both on 0% APR offers and are being paid off in time, I've also cut the cards up as I don't want to have the temptation of spending on them again. Never missed a payment on anything. 

I have a £3000 overdraft available to me through my HSBC Advance account, the interest rate is 17.9% EAR, I have previously been into my overdraft around £1200 after a holiday but have paid my way out, my bank balance atm is around £700. 

I will be getting paid again on the 18th December for the whole month, but won't be paid again then until the end of January so will have a long gap between pays. 

Now that I've laid out all my financial information, can anyone let me know how fucked up my finances are, how best to go about moving out in January 2016 into rented accommodation (would like to buy but no deposit and need to move out too soon.)

The fact that the first months rent, one months rent deposit and letting fees need to paid before I even move into a new home means I'll need to spend over £1000 initially with anywhere I move to. 

Sorry for the long winded post but I wanted to get it all out there and see what a more experienced viewpoint would say.

-$1,633.82 @ 6.8%     
Total balance: $19,174.54, monthly payment min. is $233 but I always pay extra. 

We thought of just paying the two Sallie Mae loans off, but are considering paying off all of the Great Lakes since those few with the 6.8% rates are killers and the Sallie Mae 6.25% one. This option would leave me with $21,519.20 left at only 2% but a minimum monthly payment of $383.84. Paying off both Sallie Mae loans now leaves me with a lower principal ($19,174.54) and lower monthly payment, and more repayment options in case something bad happens (lay off, etc.) but I would still have those few loans accruing interest at 6.8%.

personalfinance,Need to talk myself out of buying a $60k car.,"A couple of years ago during a particular snowy winter and many snow struggles with my current FWD car I decided to start saving for a new car - one with AWD.  This June I started a new job that pays me 70k per year and this fall I started seriously looking for my next car; my current car is 11 years old and has 107k miles on it and I really don't feel like putting more money into it (just had a $700 maintenance repair).  

I have two absolutes for my next car: True AWD and CPO.  One of the cars I'm considering is a 2013 CPO Audi S7; there's one on Autotrader for $60k with 21k miles on it.  The looks, the specs; I almost salivate imagining myself driving this car.  Of all the cars I'm considering, I would enjoy driving this one the most.  

I've run the numbers for this car and as far as I can determine I can afford this car.  I've been saving $1000 per month for the past few years and will be able to put $30k down on the car, leaving 30k to finance.  I've gotten approved for a loan for this car and if I save the remaining of the payment I'll be able to pay the car off in 31 months, which includes the increased insurance premium that will eat into my monthly budget.  According to the conventional wisdom of 28%/36% debt levels, I'll still be comfortably under, but I would be exceeding the 10% rule of the 20/4/10 rule.   

The more I think about this car the weaker my resolve gets.  But as it stands, even if I don't get this car now, I'm just going to keep putting $1000 away each month and will probably end up buying this car anyway, just with less financed.  Either that or Minnesota will get a winter storm and I'll have one white-knuckle drive to or from work too many and will get so fed up I'll make an emotional purchase just to get myself out of my current car.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation VS Original Debt over Two Accounts.,"Hey Guys, 

Been following PF for a while now, its helped greatly. 

My question is this. 

I currently worked the debt my wife and I have from 100k to about 50k, the remaining two debts are one for a car and one for a personal loan to consolidate Credit cards. 

I'm wondering whether it would be better to consolidate them both into one loan at a slightly lower interest rate over 5 years.

Currently The loans are as follows. 

Car - 24k - Fortnightly Payments - $376
Time left on loan 2.5 Years
Loan - 25k - Fortnightly Payments - $344
Time Left on Loan 4 Years.

if I consolidate it would be over a 5 year period, but the payments per fortnight would reduce by $200, my plan would be to put this continued $200 into the loan to pay it off quicker. 

My thoughts are this would give us more room to breathe financially NOW as opposed to 2.5 years once the cars paid, would it be better to wait though ?

personalfinance,First time having enough money to matter. Am I doing it right?,"Over the past year I've gotten a few promotions to the point where I can start to make some financial decisions, and I'd just love to double check that I'm not doing something dumb.  

So here's the deal, I'm 28, making about 40k/year.  Right now I've got about $3800 in checking, $2900 in savings, and a CC with a $3500 limit and about $100 balance.  Each month I pay off my CC from the checking account, then compare what's left in my checking to my savings.  If there's more in my checking (there generally is), then I'll move about half the difference from checking into savings, so they're at the same amount.  If there isn't more in the checking than savings, then I feel bad about myself and eat more ramen and drink cheaper beer the next month.

I've had a 401k through my employer since about July.  My employer matches 10% on the first 5% of my paycheck, so I've been putting away 5% to get the most out of that match.  Right now I'm at about $1000 in there.  I picked mostly long-term, high risk, high growth investments.  I've been keeping an eye on how the stocks go up and down (mostly for fun), and it's never gone down lower than my personal contributions, but it usually stays around -1% to 2% PRR.

The taxes are probably the part where I look like an idiot.  Most of my working life, when I was doing part time jobs in college and whatnot, I always made little enough money that I would always get a full refund on my Federal Income Tax.  When I first started at my current company two years ago, I assumed this would still be the case, so on the HR forms I checked the box to not withhold anything from my paycheck for taxes.  That ended up costing me about $1500 this past spring, which was most of the cash I had at the time.  I took my time to change my tax withholding to the standard withholding amount, which was probably a mistake.  At this point, I have withheld about $1000 each for Federal and California income taxes.  If I understand tax brackets correctly, it looks like I might be facing $5000 in fed taxes?  Am I boned?

I adjusted my tax withholding around the time that I got a raise (really a series of raises) from $15 to $18 to $21/hr, along with going from part-time to full time.  These also came with the 401k as well as health benefits.  The frustrating thing is that after I pay into all those things (taxes, health plan, retirement plan etc), my take-home pay is about the same as a particularly busy period making only $15/hour!  Of course I'm getting all these other valuable things, but it's hard to make them factor into my day-to-day life.

So I've been looking around this sub just a little bit for general best practices.  It looks like some of the things I'm already doing.  If the employer will match contributions, make those contributions: Check.  Have an emergency fund: Working on it.  Should 6 months pay be the goal here?  Does it matter if that's before or after tax and everything?  I understand it's a rule of thumb, but I can't be the first person to ask this.

I also have one more strange question.  I got a credit report a while ago that gave the impression that my score was hurt by the fact that I made frequent payments on my CC.  I do make payments on it pretty frequently, just because I enjoy having my checking account be a round number.  Any time my checking isn't rounded to the nearest hundred, I just round it off and drop the difference into my credit card to pay some of it off.  This shouldn't hurt my credit, right?

Thanks to anyone who took the time to glance over this and let me know if I should be doing anything in particular differently!",finance,1449636127

personalfinance,Home Equity Loans vs Line of Credit?,"Hi all,

Looking to get some advice about our current home. My husband and I are looking to make some home improvements. Long story short, we bought our home without a permit pulled on the roof when it was replaced (before us). We've had it inspected prior to our purchase and a year later (last year) by our insurance inspector, both said it was in good/great condition. 

However, because no permit was ever pulled (the home is 1960's) our insurance it is double the price. My husband and I are looking to get our home reroofed within sometime next year if possible. We don't expect to stay in this home for more than 4+ years and will likely rent it, keeping it as an investment property. We've spoken to our current insurance about this and confirmed our insurance would literally be cut in half if we had a new roof, we could easily save $150+ a month on our homeowners insurance.

We've also talked about possibly doing AirBnb if we updated the kitchen. The kitchen is small in size so it wouldn't be super expensive to renovate, but it does need to be done prior to selling or renting. The only that would be done is new cabinets and a backsplash added. We already bought better appliances since we bought our house. My husband and I currently hate the look our kitchen. It's dated and the vinyl is peeling.   

I'd also like to note when we're buying our house the real estate comps of a house with the same specs (but had an updated kitchen) was priced and sold for $20,000 more than ours. It was only a street over.  

We're also looking to have a 6' privacy fence installed. I run a daycare and I know that can expense at some of the fence each year for several years for my business - this would really impact my business in a positive way. Right now it's 4' chain fence, but we'd be expanding the previous fence line to serve more backyard space.

The question I have is, what's the best route? I'm thinking with everything (including the kitchen) it would be about $20-25,000 and that's aiming high. We've already been quoted for the fence at around $7,000. We have the funds but don't want to take that much money out of our bank accounts and our emergency fund. 

Our credit is really good and don't expect to keep the loan about for more than a couple of years if it's a personal loan. We do bank with a credit union. Don't know if that helps with the suggestions. 

I do apologize in advance if my question or any of the details I provided sounds dumb. I'm a first time home owner, just want to see what's recommended from others with more home owners experience. Thanks! :)

*Edit: Others have brought it to my attention that I meant HELOC vs. home equity loan, not a personal loan. To further clarify: Our home has also been appraised at $40,000 more than we currently owe. What's the difference between the two and what's easier?*

I have 1k in credit card debit (27.5k available credit, 8 credit accounts)
I have a car loan with 24.6k remaining (just bought a new car in June)
7k in Investments ( I have a personal ROTH IRA and TSP)
Property-wise, my new car is valued at 21.7k (kbb)

All that gives me a net worth of 7.2k

I just finished my first full year working for Uncle Sam (federally employed) and will end the year at 46k. I still have plenty of room to move up career-wise. I'm GS-7, step 2, right now. 

In terms of the future, how can make the most of what I have? I have a monthly budget going, after all monthly expenses I have about $500 left over. What should I do with the extra cash? Just started dating a very sweet girl (women are expensive, no disrespect). Going to school, part-time for that BA, tuition reimbursement covers most of that. 

I would like to get married and eventually buy a home, both of which are expensive. Worst of all, I grew up living in Orange County, CA and don't plan to move, if I don't have to. I didn't go into civil service looking to get rich, but I would like to be financially stable. 

I'd appreciate advice or suggestions. Thanks",finance,1449646233

investing,FOMC day 16th. What will the rate hike be? Should we care?,"Yellen and crew are meeting on [15th and 16th Dec](http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) and we can expect the press statement at 2pm on 16th.

A rate raise will hardly be a surprise given recent statements. Plus if you look at the forecasts by the [Fed from Sept](http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20150917.htm) of the 13 of the 17 members said the rate raise should come before the end of 2015.

**But what will Fed rates go to? How will the market react?**

Back to the Fed forecasts from Sept:

* 1 member said -0.125% would be the rate at the end of Dec 2015
* 3 members said 0.125%
* 7 members said 0.375%
* 5 members said 0.625%
* 1 member said 0.875%

Average is 0.40%

This is the forecast of the average, given the Fed uses a range. Currently it's 0.00-0.25% (midpoint 0.125%).

A 0.25% hike looks like it's on the cards, if the 0.375% is what the Fed goes for?

personalfinance,HELOC to pay down mortgage?,"I've been wondering how I could best pay off my mortgage quicker and if I pay off my mortgage, how I can tap that equity if I ever need it.  But I've heard HELOCs are something to stay away from, and I don't understand the risks and the ""why?"" to stay away from it...but I heard a pretty compelling argument to go for it.

I listened to this podcast yesterday and it seems like a smart move...Even the show hosts tried to pick it apart and find reasons not to do it (to be fair, I'm not sure of their financial qualifications and if they were asking the right/wrong questions)

https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/how-to-actually-save-thousands-on-your-mortgage/

the gist of it: You have a home, and you take a HELOC for $5k and you immediately apply that $5k toward your mortgage principle (reducing the principle by $5k reduces the interest you pay over the term of the mortgage).  Your HELOC then becomes your checking account, where your entire pay check is deposited into that HELOC account (which is considered making a HELOC payment).  Bills/investments/etc is all paid from that account (since you can deposit or withdrawal funds). The remaining amount is what pays down your HELOC balance each month.  And the interest you pay on that $5k is far far less than what $5k over 30 years would be, since it's simple interest and not amortized interest.  Obviously, you have to earn more than you spend, which we do.

Once that $5k is paid back, you start the process over...say $10k HELOC...rinse and repeat until your mortgage is paid off, sometimes in less than 10 years.  The calculations they discuss show a savings of thousands upon thousands of dollars interest you don't pay on your mortgage...which sounds awesome.

My financial picture, mostly ballpark:

Credit is 800+ on all 3 bureaus

Income: $5k per month, which is soon to increase, due to both my wife and I both using Post 9/11 GI benefits for college education (both of us will get housing allowances, putting us closer to $7k/mo)

Emergency: $5,000

Vehicle loan: $11,500 @ 2.75% (-$275/mo)

College loan: $6,000 @ 2.33% (-$140/mo)

Mortgage: $120,000 (borrowed $132,000, 0% down, VA loan), however, it has tenants and we break even every month.  

Mortgage/Insurance/Taxes: $0 (paid by tenant)

Rent: -$1,300

Groceries: -$400/mo

Various other (utilities, vehicles, etc): -$500

We've recently paid off a significant amount of debt, and we're trying to cut our expenses and live on less than $3k per month, and put any extra toward vehicle/college loans.  I'm following the methodology of paying off all of my debts (sans mortgage) before i start investing. I realize, with the low interest rates on what remains, I could get much better returns by investing and paying the minimums on those...but I've spent years filling in this hole I dug and I just want the damn things paid off. I'm tired of looking at negative balances.

personalfinance,Help me with my current career and new job offer please! (USA),"Hey everyone! So I just received a job offer and I am torn if I should take it or not. Here's some background information:

I'm 22 and I did 4 years in the Navy as an IT and currently go to college full time using my GI Bill. I will be completing my Bachelors in Information Systems Management some time in 2016 and soon after I will begin pursuing my Masters in a similiar field. The VA pays for college and I am taking full advantage of that perk while I can.

Currently, I work for a large company doing IT/Sysadmin/engineering type work. Here is a breakdown of my current benefits.

Salary- $58K

Health/Dental/Vision/Life/Disability Insurance- $1080 yearly

401K- $3480 + $3480 match (6% of salary/max)

12 PTO Days + 2 Personal Holidays/year

All paid federal holidays, I believe it is a 11 per year.


GI Bill BAH- $2300/month This GI BIll income will not change as long as I am enrolled full time in school which I will continue to be.

New position benefits.

 Salary- $34.05/$65736 yearly

 All insurance- $1400 yearly

 Retirement- 5% contribution retirement plan

PTO- 12 Days

 No paid holidays. When the school district is closed it is considered a day off of work. Most jobs including my current one work 2080 hours or 260 days per year. This new job works 1920 hours or 240 days per
year. So in the end, I'm working less and making more money.

My current company I feel like there is a little room for upward movement. Maybe not in my current group but we employee 80k+ employees around the world. I know I could apply for any other job and have a decent chance of getting it if I meet the requirements. For example, a manager left the current group I work for and they are forcing employees who are eligible for the position apply for ti just like anyone else would (corporate policy). The only advancement I see is my yearly pay raise based on performance (2-6%).

This new job I know there is very little room for advancement because of how small the team is (4 people including me). I know I will get my yearly raises but doubt I'll ever move into management there because the positions just don't exist as of right now.

Now here is the kicker. Whatever job I have when I complete my Masters degree won't be the job I'll have for the rest of my life. Once my degree is done I plan on leaving whatever job I have once I find something more in line with my qualifications.

 Any advice, Reddit?

personalfinance,What has been successful for you as your teach your children? I want my children to feel the burn of compound interest working against them.,"First of all, I don't want my kids to be in financial ruin. What I mean is that I want to teach them early in life about the force of compound interest and how you want it working for you and not against you. Teaching children is a common theme, and I've read through many previous posts. I have some more ideas.

&amp;nbsp;

As a kid, I earned money for chores, worked for my dads business and was taught some general financial principles about how you earn money, how you should put some into savings, but I was never taught about compound interest, especially in the form of a loan. At 18 I did what a lot of new adults do, I got a credit card and proceeded to max it out. Early in my adult life I also purchased a car on an 18% interest loan. Needless to say, I felt the burn of compound interested and got my act together by my mid twenties.

&amp;nbsp;

This is partially a philosophical question: can you really learn, with conviction, about staying out of debt and avoiding compound interest without first being burned by it? Does that principle really sink in if you just casually add interest to their savings to teach them? So as my daughter gets older, I've considered opening the ""Bank of Dad"". In short, I'll teach her to work and save, but if she wants a loan from dad, I'll give it and i'll include a high interest rate. I guess the hope is that within the confines of the home, she'll get burned by the interest at the Bank of Dad and learn avoid it when she get to the real world as a young adult.",finance,1449676129

I have 28k in Federal Loans- I am about to switch these loans to income based payments so that I can focus primarily on my private loans (60k).  

I currently am working a very secure job with a starting salary of about 40k.  I don't see much room for progress at this job but for now it will help pay my bills.  I just got an email for a 2nd round interview for a job that would pay me 52k.  This job is more in line with my degree and passions but the job security isn't as promising as the current job I have now.  My current job is a state job and the other is working with a non-profit. My question is, with my very heavy debt, would it be financially risky to take this higher paying job if it may not guarantee a job a few years down the road (if there was cuts in funding, etc).

personalfinance,"Leaving grad school, just got a raise, and have some debt - Advice?","I've been lurking here for a while and felt it was time to see out some advice of my own. 

Without rambling too much, I recently made the decision to leave my Masters program as I no longer want to pursue that path. Coincidentally, I also just received a big raise at work which was a nice surprise in the midst of me freaking me out about my future. 

So, now I'm in a bit of a different place financially than I was a month ago. 

I was paying for some of school up front while taking loans to fill in the rest. I'll no longer have that payment now, but I will obviously have to start paying back my loan. 

My main goal is to get all other debt down though. 

For details, I am now making 78,000 a year. I've been saving what I could, which has never been a strength of mine, in anticipation having no job while I student teach. Since that is no longer happening, I have a 5,600 in savings currently that I can use for other things. 

For debt I have a $500 MRI bill that I've been paying slowly, along with a credit card that has $1,400 on it. The big thing is another credit card I got when I was 18 that is at 4,400 and feels impossible to make any dent on due to a high interest rate since it's a ""student card"". I have called on that too and even though I am now 30 with good credit and never a late payment, they won't knock down the interest. 

What would be the best way to work on these? Should I take some from savings and just pay off the MRI to get it out of my life? Should I do the same with the smaller credit card? My hope was to pay that off and then transfer some of the larger onto it so the interest rate is lower. 

I feel in an ok place overall but there's a few things I just really want to work on and it looks like I finally can. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1449684370

ethereum,"""It seems your firm is designed to disintermediate firms like ours, how would it be advantageous to us to work with you?""","Answer to the above question from a large financial institution when I was building Etherplan:

""Hi [name edited for privacy reasons],
 
I think that [your company] leveraged like none else the platform migration from traditional telecommunications to internet since 1994 and became a preeminent tech platform for customers (B2B primarily).
 
But the internet didn't change much of the underlying financial system: banks still store and transfer money, DTCC, exchanges, ACH, Fedwire, CHIPS, Euroclear still clear, settle and process payments, and everything is still separated in sylos (NY, London, Zurich, Geneva, Tokyo, etc.).
 
The Ethereum blockchain (and others) represents a change of platform again, but where all the above functions will be inextricably dissolved. I think the future is a global blockchain ecosystem regulated and controlled differently.
 
In my mind [you firm's] culture is that to follow and embrace these changes in platform, as an opportunity, rather than resist them.  
 
I think the traditional roles of market access, market making, cash and securities lending, deposits and loans, insurance, asset management, planning, research and investment banking will continue, only on a different platform, pricing, and format.
 
My startup will not disintermediate [your business], the blockchain will. On Ethereum account administration, custody, settlements, securities issuance, exchanges, etc. will all be software programs, managed and owned externally, but stored in the public (or private) blockchain.
 
Etherplan is a registered investment advisor (RIA) adapted to, and on top of, the blockchain acting as a wealth manager, but it needs securities to be issued and traded, market makers, liquidity, and all other functions that [your firm] will do when it decides to embrace the change.
 
Etherplan will help people create their decentralized autonomous portfolios, but those portfolios still need to buy securities, lend money, earn a return, and use many ancillary services like liquidity, reliable quotes and market information.
 
Finally, as this change unfolds, a great part of the industry will be ""off-blockchain"" and through APIs Etherplan needs the traditional services that your firm currently provides.
 
[Name edited], I hope my opinion above is useful and we can talk further about a possible partnership. A partnership means from equity ownership to work together to connect our systems to trade and manage the money of the decentralized portfolios.
 
What do you think?

2: (as a sniper) Ghillie suits (sorry guys top of my list)

3: snipers were more useful, apart from being able to spot, and lay out motion sensors, they could also call down tactical mortar strikes that could prevent enemies and vehicles from taking objectives

4: It had fewer vehicles and more infantry based even on larger maps

5: Blackhawk, and the miniguns on it actually FSU

6: Dog Tags were a trophy to steal not something that they gave you to be a special snowflake, and they displayed them like trophies with everyone of the names you ever knifed

7: rush had air born assault (jumping out of transports)

8:  Apache AH-64 (woot)

9: smaller (yet open) maps made for heavier combat (all those guys fighting over one point to try and change the tide of the battle)

10: most objects could be brought to the ground

11: no scope glint (snipers should be able to hide effectively if they are good and not have a flashlight pointing out of their head, a visible sniper is a failing sniper)

12: weapon attachments/mods are not all over the place and have Specific jobs (mag bullets do more damage / travel faster etc.)

13: AA was at the base [although it could be destroyed =(  ]

14: There were no automatic fire and forget missiles, everything was either guide by wire or designated with a laser lock (this pistol thingy that shot a strobe) this meant that engineers needed skill to take down choppers

AA is indestructible and able to be used by players but is locked to the base to prevent base rape (we've all been there)

keep the weapon system and amount of weapons similar to BFBC2

* I'm happy to leg-in, and then leg-out. I'm thinking of (4) lots -- (2) at 1.1000 and (2) at 1.1100 -- then cashing out on the way down. As in, take profit at 50 pips, 100 pips, 200 pips, then 400 pips.

* I know the Fed Funds Rate decision is Dec 16, and I know that a rate hike is widely expected. I've been reading the news, and it sounds like the rate increase is already priced in, and that if the hike is in-line with expectations, there could occur some profit-taking on USD longs, which would actually drive EURUSD up after the announcement. Maybe 1.1000 is too early, and I can get short at a better price next week.

$5.5K Roth IRA

$10K misc. expenses. Clothes, gifts, charity, lotto tickets, etc.

**$16.5K WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS MONEY???**

That is my big question, to myself. In all likelihood, it could be more than $16.5K, I really don't see myself having $10K in misc. expenses. I don't blow money on random stuff. Right now, I'm planning on investing in some higher risk Vanguard funds. Is $20K at all times a good amount of cash on hand? I have looked into real estate, e.g. buying an apartment to live in and rent the other rooms, but I don't know if that's for me.",finance,1449711842
personalfinance,Should I just go ahead and redeem my savings bonds?,"My uncle just reminded me of the savings bonds he's been giving me over the past 23 years. Just wanted some advice on whether to cash them or to continue to let them mature. I feel like 1.3% isn't the best of return rates and I could use the extra cash to pay for a small vacation I'm taking in a few weeks. On the other hand I was thinking of just cashing the ones that have already hit face value and leave the others to mature longer, just afraid I'll forget about them eventually. Or should I just let them sit, I'm not exactly strapped for cash or anything.

Forex,"Euro over 1.10, what is this madness? Divergence in USDJPY, and CAD is looking bad!","Nowotny called the market's aggressive move 'absurd' today and Euro climbed even higher because of a massive short squeeze. How long do we think this will last? I'm not sure but Draghi needs to set the record straight otherwise it will be really hard for ECB to meet its inflation target. 

There is a significant divergence in USDJPY and USGG2YR index (121 vs  0.945 yield). Historically, divergence doesn't last long. I believe USDJPY will readjust to accommodate the yield. 

Bad news keep coming for CAD and with terrible job numbers and low oil prices, there is no upside for CAD. According to Poloz, lowering interest rates further is not out of the question and that there are more tools he can deploy. This one I'm trading with entry at 1.3550 and target for 1.4000.

**Terror on Moonbase Alpha** - Chapter 43 Part 1
___
___

""You... idiot!"" Jacob and Kara exclaimed, in unison, turning to face the TAK armor that towered above them. ""What the hell did you just do??"" 

The faceplate of the armor slid back to reveal a smug-faced Mary staring back at them. ""I saved your life.  Lives?  Are you really a living thing anymore, Kara?  Or just a psychic parasite?""

""We were talking it down, it was in the middle of showing us who captured it when you blew its fucking head off!!"" Kara felt rage, real, white-hot rage bubbling inside her.

""It contacted its race, you idiot.  They're coming -- all of them -- and they're going to erase every living thing on the planet because of what was done to one of theirs.  And that's when they thought that it was still alive.  'Wiping everything out' was just for the years of isolation and torture.  You just fucking killed it!""

Mary stood there, dumbfounded.  ""I didn't know...""

""Of course you didn't know!  You didn't think.  You never think, you do what you want and damn the consequences.  Sarah would be proud.""

The room fell deathly silent then, as if all of the sound save for the faint whirring of the armor's servos had been sucked out into space.

""Don't you dare say her name..."" Mary whispered.

""Why are you going to kill me? You just doomed an entire planet, you idiot. We barely survived one of these things, you think we can take on their entire species?""

""This isn't going to solve anything,"" Jacob interjected.

""No, no it is,"" Mary cooed, her gaze hardening.  ""Our dear friend Kara clearly has a bone to pick with me, maybe she has some new and interesting way to tell me how stupid I am.""

Silence.

""Oh, nothing more to say there, Kara?  No inspiring words about the view from up on that high horse of yours?  God, to think of how much of your whining I had to sit through, listening to you complain and simper and dither about the most basic decisions while people died all around you. You know, maybe that's the truth of it, maybe the reason we're here right now is that I didn't step up sooner.  I should've saved us all from you.""

Mary looked down at her hands for a long while, her thoughts empty, just staring at the metal fingers as they clenched and un-clenched into fists.

""Hell, if we're all going to die anyway, then we've got nothing to lose, right?  Why, I'd be a fool to go to my grave without kicking your ass proper."" Mary laughed, shaking her head.

""Oh, please,"" Kara scoffed, though there was a tinge of worry in her voice, one that Mary picked up on immediately and it made her smile widen.

Jacob took a defensive stance, ""We didn't survive all of this bullshit to just go at each other's throats now!  I think we've still got a chance if we --""

""Shut it, muscle boy,"" Mary looked to him with disdain, leveling the TAK armor's laser rifle at him.  ""This is happening. Kara, you can come out and face me, or I put a hole in your host and you face me anyway. Actually, now that I think about it--""

Kara and Jacob both saw it coming, the finger depress the trigger, the glow at the end of the rifle.  Together their reflexes shot into action, in unison, sending Jacob diving to the side before the blast hit home.  

He rolled and she prepared his next move, a diving launch forward that brought him within striking range.  ""Your left!"" Kara called, and Jacob juked right as the metal fist rocketed toward his head, taking him behind Mary's armor and in front of the other two.  

They could see that one of the armors, the one with Sofia in it, was barely functioning, it  was the one where the goop had eaten through the joints on one side.  There was clearly some fire damage to it, probably from when they burned the goop out from inside.

The important part was that it was the slowest of the three by far, and Kara knew that it would give them a modicum of cover, at least for the moment.

""Come out and face me, Kara!"" Mary called.  ""Don't be scared, I'm only going to beat you senseless!""  Her heavy arm grasped the side of Sofia's armor and yanked it aside; controlled or not, Sofia let out an instinctive, scared cry.

Jacob ran with it, making sure to keep as much of the hulking metal chassis between them as possible.

""Mary, look at what you're doing, you're going to start hurting others now?"" Jacob called.

""What does it matter? Right? I just killed us all, anyway!""  She grabbed onto the loosely hanging arm of Sofia's TAK armor and ripped it free, whipping it at them.  Jacob slid to the side easily, watching as the arm clanged and crumpled into the wall. 

Mary clutched the edge of the chest piece and with a groan, ripped it wide, exposing the tiny human inside.  Sofia may have been being controlled, but she was awake, aware... and utterly terrified.

""How much blood do you want on your hands, Kara?"" She reached in and grabbed Sofia around the ribcage.  ""I've already got enough reasons to hate this bitch and you've given me all the excuse I need.  Might as well just get it out of the way, right?""

Jacob stepped out from behind the armor, body still tensed.

""Mary, stop it!  Look at yourself: this is what you do.  You're self-destructing."" Kara said to her.

""Yeah?"" Mary looked at them solemnly.  ""Yeah, I guess you're right.""

Sofia screamed as the gears and motors in the hand leapt into action, clenching, gripping, squeezing tight around her - the audible crackle-snaps of her rib cage and shoulders and arms merging into a high-pitched whirring wail.  Blood leaked then poured from Sofia's eyes and nose and mouth before she finally slumped forward, silent as the grave.

She turned, aiming the laser rifle at Chelsea's head before firing.  The blasts didn't seem to have any effect... at first.  But Mary kept firing, and firing and, after a few moments, the metal of the helmet began to glow white hot.  From inside, muffled screams could be heard along with the sound of sizzling flesh.

""You've got my full attention now, Kara.  And I'm going rip you to shreds.""

personalfinance,"Pay-off low interest debt, or invest?","Hello all.  We were having some car issues in the past few months that led me to purchasing 2 new vehicles (1 for my wife, and 1 for me) over the past 3 months.  

Other than my mortgage these 2 cars are my only debt.  I have a very good credit score (800+) so I was able to get the car-loans at low rates, this is the interest rate on my 3 debt items:

* Mortgage - 3.25% - 2288/month - 385k remaining
* My Truck - 1.49% - 1045/month - 36k remaining (3y loan)
* Wife's Car - 2.25% - 735/month - 32k remaining (4y loan)

I have my E-Fund almost completed (5 months expenses at the moment), and have some other investments that I'm not interested in liquidating at the moment.  My initial instinct was to quickly pay-down my wife's car, and then focus on mine, but since *all* my debt is below 3.25% interest the only reason to pay any of it off early would be to improve my credit score and increase cash-flow.

I generally have about 2.5k/month left-over after expenses, and like I said, I've been throwing it in the E-fund.  So once the E-fund is completed I was wondering if I should throw the 2.5k/month into investments or into some of the above listed debt.

Bitcoin,Could we please make a stronger attempt to bridge this divide in the community and get more insight into the thought processes of the Core Developers?,"I'm making this post in what may be a futile attempt to bridge this ever widening gap in the Bitcoin community. This is mostly going to be from the perspective of a small-time investor, not a technical guy at all. I may not be the most qualified person to make this post, but I'd like to see more posts like this so that it may be possible for us to move past this current quagmire as a more unified community. I'm posting in this subreddit even under the fear that it may get removed because I want this to be seen by more than just the people that have been pushed out of this community.

Having said that, I think the first thing that we should acknowledge is that an extremely significant portion of the Bitcoin community HATE the core developers. I know that many don't care that this happens to be true, but this really should be cause for alarm. I'll spend most of this post addressing the reasons I think this is the case, then perhaps in the comments others can chime in, and we can hear from the Core developers as well. 

I'd like to see more polls done within the community so that we can find a better sense of the thoughts of everybody. I'm not sure where the majority of support lies but I think we need to make a better effort to address the concerns of everybody, so that we can move forward as one, stronger unit. Every one of us have invested into Bitcoin in some way, and collectively, we are what make Bitcoin worth $414 dollars. If a significant portion of us get fed up and leave, we can expect price drop, which is bad for everybody. (Unless of course you have decided to short Bitcoin.) But the people that leave are probably not going to leave Crypto altogether. Personally, I've started putting more and more of my money into alt-coins that seem better equipped to fulfill the potential which Bitcoin may not be able to with the current development team. If enough of us decide that, it's possible that another coin could take over. 

While this is unlikely, I think it's undeniably true that many have liquidated their Bitcoin holdings because this loss of faith in developers, and I think there are far more people that would like to invest, but think that Bitcoin is too risky with its current development team.

To that end, let's restore confidence in the current team by delving into their thought processes. I think everything unfortunately comes back to the blocksize debate. It's exhausting, but it needs to come to a conclusion if we want more people to invest in Bitcoin. And I think we all want as many people to invest in Bitcoin as possible. 

1. Core Developers don't seem to have any urgency to get this block size thing resolved. I think most people see this as the number one problem with bitcoin right now, and would like to see is all effort being put into a permanent solution before we see the developers work on less critical things. A lot of talk has been thrown around about a temporary, small increase to buy more time, but many want this blocksize issue to be in Bitcoin's rear-view mirror. The reason being that as long as this uncertainty exists, there are a lot of investors that simply won't get into bitcoin, and to foster the network effect, we need to get as many people in as soon as possible. We have a halving coming up shortly, which brings with it a potential price increase, and I for one would like to see how much it can go up if we don't have this blocksize cloud hanging over investors. So the question for Core Developers is, how much do you feel the same? How committed are you to putting out a permanent solution as quickly as is safe?(This, by the way, is why BIP101 is so appealing to so many people. It may not be the best solution, but it is A solution. One that has been tested, and can resolve this debate once and for all.)

2. The Core Developers don't seem to be willing to compromise much. It's great that we had those scaling Bitcoin conferences, but what did we get out of them? When the major exchanges came out this summer in support of BIP101, the Core developers quickly issued a letter saying that they've heard our concerns, and asked us to wait until the Scaling Bitcoin conferences were over. Many were hoping for a clear path forward and a clear alternative to BIP101 upon the conclusion of the second one, but the second one has concluded and we do not have that. We have a lot of promising ideas, but nothing that would be an alternative to BIP101. (That is, something that would conclude this block size debate once and for all.) We don't even have a timeline or a plan for one. It seems to me that a golden opportunity was missed to compromise on BIP101. I didn't see anything come out of the conference that would last us more than a couple of years. BIP101 supporters want a clear path forward and they still do not have that from Core. So the questions is, how willing are you to compromise with the people that want BIP101? Would you be willing to compromise on a version of BIP101 that started at 4MB, or doubled slower?

3. The Core developers aren't very good at communicating with their detractors. I think this is in part because they have little interest in communicating with people that don't understand the technical side of things. There is a sense that they see themselves above everybody else, and that they do not answer to the people that give their project value. Contrast this with the simple, thorough, and easy-to-understand, blog posts of Gavin and Mike. Gavin made a series of blog posts addressing every single one of Core developers concerns about raising the block size. As a casual investor, I really get the sense that he knows what he's talking about, and I trust him to lead us forward. The core developers didn't really do an adequate job explaining to us why that trust would be misplaced, and didn't adequately address his points about raising the block size. So the question is, will Core Developers make a better effort to communicate with us, and make us feel that our concerns are being heard? (This would of course include publicly denouncing the censorship which runs through some of the main Bitcoin channels, instead of pretending like it doesn't exist, or that it's not a problem.)

4. It feels like core developers have framed the argument about raising the block size in a bad way. They have presented this as a matter of centralization vs. decentralization. Could you help us better understand why supporting BIP101 is necessarily synonymous with centralization, and why that would be a bad thing. It seems to me that the biggest concern is that if the block size gets too high, then it will be too cost prohibitive for an individual to run a full node, and it may lead to transactions not being broadcast because those transactions go against the interests of the small number of node operators that can afford to run them. (If I understand the argument correctly.) However, I'm not really too concerned about it. It seems that no matter how big Bitcoin gets, there will always be a significant number of early adopters that care about Bitcoin's decentralization, and will be able to afford to run a full node. This makes some sense, right? If we're maxing out 8GB blocks, it's difficult to imagine that bitcoin is going to continue to be worth $414 dollars. Most likely they will be worth tens of thousands of dollars, and given how much more affordable memory, disc space, and bandwidth are each and every year, I have a really hard time imagining a scenario where a full node would be so costly to operate that they there wouldn't still be plenty that are are willing to broadcast any valid transaction. So where am I wrong here? Why should I be more concerned about this than I am? (Also, when it comes to centralization, why is it okay for the future of Bitcoin to rely on Blockstream's ability to put out a functional Lightning network? If we had to rely on such a network to continue to make transactions affordably, wouldn't that be centralization as well?)

5. It feels like the core developers are abandoning some of the potential that Bitcoin has to offer. When I was first  looking into Bitcoin, I was told about all the potential the the blockchain could offer. This is one of the reasons I invested. We could use bitcoin for normal peer-to-peer financial transactions, but also micropayments, smart contracts, remittances, a distributed public ledger, colored coins, etc. It seems like if we want our currency to have the most possible value, shouldn't we try to do everything in our power to maximizes it's potential uses? Shouldn't we be inviting people to use our blockchain to use as they please instead of pushing them toward private blockchains? Do we still want Bitcoin to remain peer-to-peer? There seems to be a debate over whether Bitcoin should be merely a settlement layer. Can't it be both? Wouldn't it be more useful as both? Wouldn't that drive more people to invest?

This is getting long, and I know this isn't an exhaustive list of complaints, but I think it hits at the biggest ones. I also realize I may be showing my ignorance here as well, so please do correct any misunderstandings. I have a significant portion of my total wealth tied up in this currency, and I would like to be reassured that this remains a good investment with Core developers in charge. I believe that they do want what's best for Bitcoin, but their words and actions have been confusing, and fostering a greater divide in the community. It certainly feels like they aren't too concerned about Bitcoin as an investment for a lot of people, and I'd like to see that changed.

**Background**

* 38K in Fed Student Loans at 6.25%

* 29k in Private Student Loans at 3.00%

* I contributed 8% to my 401K and company matches 6%

* I've also put $1000 toward a ROTH IRA this year

* No credit card debt, auto debt, or any other debts

* I have a 6-month emergency fund

I'm 27, finished grad school and started working when I was 25, contractor for two years and didn't save much toward retirement, so I'm thinking I want to ""catch up"" since I'm young and it's important. With my first year of company match, I've got about 12k in 401k this year. I'm thinking I'd like to put $4500 more, see above, to max my ROTH, giving me roughly 18k in retirement savings this year. 

Additionally, I'd like to put $5500 toward my Federal Loans, as that will keep me on a 10 year pace to have them paid off. I chose the Fed since it has the higher interest rate, using advice I've seen on this sub.

Finally, I would like to be saving for a house/wedding when the time comes one day, so I was thinking of putting the remainder, roughly 8k, towards savings. I know I could be paying down debt quicker with this money, but I'm not sure it's in my best interest to be debt free quicker but with no funds to put a down payment on a house. I was thinking I could put this money in my brokerage account in an ETF, seeing as I think my house timeline is probably 4+years.

Sorry if this is too much info, I know sometimes people lack that so I tried to be thorough. I'd really appreciate your feedback on this plan, or any advice you would give to alter it. Thank you.",finance,1449760563

personalfinance,"Forced ride in an ambulance and left with $1,400 bill","Hello.

I've created this throwaway to more or less tell you my story of a night I had a few months ago. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

My ex had been cheating on me. One night after a few drinks, I had the opportunity to flip him off and tell him to die in a fire. That was neat, right? Anyway, I was still sad, as she had told me she was going to visit the local art showings ('first friday' of the month in Indianapolis.) but was instead riding off in this guy's car. I had read that police officers would have a friendly chat with you sometimes if you were sad. I tried to contact the non-emergency line.

 They decided I was going to hurt myself if left alone. After a short discussion, I decided interrogation wasn't what I was looking for and that I wanted to be in my apartment alone again. The two officers then tackled me to the ground on my own doorstep, handcuffed me, sent me on a ride in an ambulance where I had the opportunity to be hand-fed high-sugar paste because my blood-sugar was below normal. 

They confiscated my things (permanently taking my $5 rainbow-anodized pocket knife I'd found in a Walmart discount aisle) and I was made to sit in the hospital until about 5 or 6 AM the next day. They found my BAC to be under the legal limit. No charges filed. No shakes. Didn't sleep well. They told me I suffer from alcoholism and depression, and they gave me a taxi ride to my apartment. My left arm is still a little screwy from trying to hold 500lbs of human for a brief period before my face could help out with the weight. Cement doesn't give very much, so my eyebrow is still a little funny looking. (I've gotten 'did you have a piercing ripped out of your eyebrow recently?' a few times.)

My parents assisted me in a swift move to another apartment the day I was released. I've accumulated more money than I've ever had in my life, working as a warehouse employee- which is not much. Eskenazi health just contacted me asking for $1,400, mentioning that the next move would be taking it to a collections agency. 

They don't really have much they could take away from me. I don't own my car. Barely own my bed. I slept on the hardwood flooring of the other apartment for at least half a year before I was gifted the bed. Obviously I rent my studio. I guess I have clothes they could steal.

I am insured through my parents. Do I really have to pay so much for essentially being naive to the fact that police don't serve and protect so much as search for a reason to attack and quarantine? I was excited to buy presents for my family members for the first time ever...",finance,1449762217

datascience,Coursera Data Science Specializations - John Hopkins Data Sci vs. UCSD Big Data,"Disclaimer - I don't have a formal CS degree but learned programming through grad school (data analytics in social science) and an immersion program. And yes - a thoughtful Reddit user informed me I left off the ""S"" on Johns in the title. Amended below though :-) .

I've been work as a platform dev for approx 18 months writing a blend of Python and Java code. Most of my work focuses on picking up data from third party APIs, sticking it into our data pipeline, and pulling it out with Python to serve up for our web app after it's been fed into the various MapReduce jobs we have to format the data into the shape we need. 

What do I want to do in the future?

I want to understand how to build models to derive insights from data, knowing how to clean it, work with data at scale, identify holes in data sets, and essentially work efficiently with data. With a background in social science research I'm inclined towards working in a space where non-profit meets data, but I'm comfortable working within the more traditional technical space provided it's within the realms of ""data engineering"" (as I understand it).

What I'm trying to do -

Outside of networking, finding folks in the community who do work I may be interested in, I want to pursue learning to help fill in the gaps. I may (mostly likely) invest in another grad program down the line once I've defined my career goals more specifically. MOOC therefore provide an attractive option for me.

Johns Hopkins Data Sci specialization and the UCSD Big Data specialization are two course listings that pop out to me. It appears to me the former may be more academically minded whereas the latter is more professional minded. True or not, I'm at a crossroads as to which one to pursue. 

I have a strong background in Python and have worked in R - not caring for it entirely. The JH track is R only and most reviews say the content is quite introductory at best. 

Does anyone have any insight for what may be better? I'm not looking to move into the academic space but wish to use the specialization to help me in professional development.",technology,1449764373

I have severe depression to the point where I can't function anymore.  I hate my job and hate my career and overall hate my life.  I was forced into going to college and doing computer science and having to pay for it all myself.  I thought I could suck it up and put 3k away every month until it's gone, but I'm on the verge of suicide.  I tried applying to new jobs with new companies and I haven't heard anything back or I fail at my interviews because of my anxiety.

I don't mind doing some other job that doesn't involve programming, but they won't make nearly as much and I can't stand to have debt over my head.  I'm in debt by not even my choice.  I live very minimally and don't really want any material items and could easily live on a minimum wage job if I didn't have debt.

I guess my question is... is there anything that I can do?  I looked at any possible ways of forgiving the loans, but nothing helps with computer science.  I also looked into depression disability, but couldn't find anything other than physical disabilities.

If I could get the fee down to 2% can anyone tell me why this would be a bad decision?

personalfinance,Student loans are killing me.,"My family didn't make a lot of money when I was in high school, but I had great grades and lots of ECA's, so I got into a great school. Freshmen year financing was fine, I had to take a couple thousand in loans, but not a big deal. Sophomore year, my father got remarried and now I had to pay $10K more than what I had the year before. Junior year I transferred to a much cheaper school and was there for an extra year because the new school didn't take all of my credits. Long story short, my student loan bills are massive, and I don't know how to pay them.

Below is a break down of the bills in question. As far as income is concerned, I take home about $1600/mo, $2k before taxes. My degree is in Mathematics, so I've considered finding a new job, but I know if I can hold out on this one a couple more months, this one will pay me about $2K per month. 

|Loan| Balance | Interest rate | avg. monthly payment amount|
|-|-|-|-|
| Group A | 3496.56| 5.6% | 22.82 |
| Group B | 4420.97 | 4.5% | 27.59 |
|Group C | 15155.78 | 6.8% | 67.81 |

| PLUS | 31,370| 7.9% | 405.|
|TOTAL | 67566.73| N/A | 600.78


I usually round these up to the nearest dollar or 10 dollar increment, but it seems to not be getting me very far very fast. My other bills take up about $1450/mo (everything from rent, to food, electric, etc. etc. I can give a break down of those if it would help).

Ideas: I don't have a lot, but these are all 10 year plans scheduled to go up every year. I was thinking, since my credit is pretty good, I could wrap groups A and C into a loan/line of credit with a credit union at a lower interest and maybe save some money. But, I'm afraid of being staddled with that kind of debt with a financial institution instead of the government. I mean, if Bernie or Hilary win, they've promised to make changes and I might be able to refi, or get forgiveness, so I don't want to have to eat the biggest chunk of that. 
When I get my tax return ( expected to be about 3,000, I'm going to pay off my car loan (1900 at 2.4%) Group f, and a couple other long-term bills I've got, but I don't think that'll do enough to make things any easier.

Basically, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I feel doomed, because like this, not only am I bleeding through my dad's retirment (he's trying to help me) but I won't be able to buy a home until I'm 35, start a family anytime in the next 5 years, or really any of my life goals. I pay more for my student loans than I do for Rent, and I can't possibly save anywhere. 

Edit: The general consensus seems to be focusing on each one individually. Whether from top to bottom, or bottom to top seems to vary, but I appreciate all the advice. Does anyone know of any reputable places I (or my dad for the PLUS loan) can look for refi options? One of the options I looked at for consolidation would be structucing all (except plus loan) under a single interest, the weighted average of all the interests. If my math is correct, that's 5.2%. Can anyone verify that?

Edit 2: The PLUS loan is in my father's name and as mentioned, he's basically bleeding his retirement to try and pay it. I help when I can with a couple hundred here or there, but it's getting tougher and tougher on him. What options do/does we/he have in that regard?",finance,1449767537

Proceeding to the first checkout page, I selected their cheapest option for shipping which was $7.99. Upon moving to the next page and entering my shipping address, a new menu appeared prompting for a new shipping option. I had the pretty standard options, UPS 2nd day, 3rd, FedEx 2nd day, USPS priority. The prices for all of them were labeled as TBD however! I picked USPS because I believed it to be the cheapest, and there was no way it could be anything over $20 tops.

So I finished the transaction and was sent my confirmation, with a total of $50.46. The next day it was shipped and I received a new email, stating that my total was now $84.45!

We have a 25k HELOC on our home with ~10k on the balance @ 3.99 variable rate. I've been planning to pay it off next year but we have other loans that have higher rates such as a car and upcoming pet bill, nothing that is hard on us financially other than liquid flow of cash.

I've been thinking of locking in a fixed rate for our loan which would be 5.635 for P&amp;I or 5.385 for just Interest before the Fed rate goes up, which would cause the variable rate to rise. The question I have is, how much would a rise in interest rate raise my variable rate on my HELOC? would be whatever the delta of the new rate is or more?

* I have overtime available at work and with the addition to the $700 left over for food and savings, I can make $600 extra after taxes additionally, so I would have about $1,300 left over.
* I have no debt what so ever. No credit cards, finished my student loans

Home is in new jersey . 
After this gift, will still be below the lifetime gift amount so no gift tax will be due at this point I think. 

If we use a quitclaim deed ,will the cost basis for the children be the current market value ? 

would like to pass title to children now or through a trust. 

If  we use a quitclaim deed to transfer the equity in a home from parents to children ,is this the best way ? Any downside to using a quitclaim deed ?

If we use a qualified personal residence trust can the beneficiaries take a mortgage to purchase an additional property at the going interest rates ?

personalfinance,Put into my Roth IRA or save to pay off car earlier?,"Hello.  I hope you guys can help me with my decision.

First a little background on my current finances.  I make about $3000/mo. net income (this can go up $200 - $400 if I get overtime).  My expenses come out to ~$2000/mo. (food, car payment, gas, voya (ING) account, rent, misc.). I currently have about $7000 in savings, $900 in my checking.

I am currently debating on whether I should save my money to pay off my car earlier, or if I should instead put money into my Roth IRA account before the year ends.

I know by putting money into my Roth account, it'll help with my taxes when I file them next year and also help me in the long term towards retirement, but I'm wondering if paying my car off earlier would be more beneficial, as that would essentially clear me of any ""debt"".

With my current income, I can likely pay off my car sometime next year, regardless of if I put into my Roth account, but by not putting into my Roth, it will allow me opportunity to pay off my car a few months faster, which in turn allows me to increase my monthly savings and not lose on the interest I pay into my car.

My car payment comes out to about $370/mo. ($54.00 of this payment is interest) and I have ~16,700 left to pay on it at an interest rate of 3.89%.

So basically, should I just keep saving to pay off my car faster or put money into my Roth instead?  If ya'll do recommend putting into my Roth, is there a minimum amount I should put in or should I try to max out this year so it helps me in the long term?

I have contemplated just putting in about $1500 (come my next paycheck), which would leave me with a savings of about $6000 (3 mo. emergency fund amount).",finance,1449802788

investing,Are we crazy to buy VAB Bonds?,"Edit: Note that VAB is a Canadian Bond ETF

We know interest rates cannot decrease much more (Bank of Canada is likely going to decrease rates and looking at negative rates as an option), from this point they can only rise.


Average dividends from VAB is 3.4% [1] and capital gains are likely to decrease over the next 5-10 years due to interest rates being historically low. 

If the discount rate (today’s interest rate) is higher than the coupon rate (3.4%) the present value will be less than par and you’re buying at a discount. If the discount rate is lower than the coupon rate, the present value will be higher than par value and your buying at a premium. [2]



Why are we diversifying with bonds bought at a premium that are only going to lose value instead of GICs or holding cash?


The conventional wisdom is that bonds are inversely correlated with stocks, this assumes that when stocks decline that bonds will decline because interest rates will drop. But what happens when stocks decline and interest rates don’t have room to drop, or worse, they rise?  


Isn’t it intuitive that we should be putting our “bond” money in a high interest savings account or GICs instead until interest rates become higher than the coupon rate?

We currently live in an apartment for about 1100/mo with utilities, and have figured out a house in another area potentially wouldn't cost much more: estimated around 1200/mo with everything (property tax, PMI, etc) other than the utility bill. We both have very good credit, so I would think our interest rate around be 3.75-4%.


We only have around 2k in savings, reason being up until this point we've been dumping as much money as possible every month into my highest-interest student loans to get them paid off. Right now I'm left with about 10k @ 7.5% for private student loan debt, and about 30k @ 4.5% for federal student loan debt.


My question is how our money would be better placed: (1) continue paying down the high-interest student loan debt, and having a smaller down payment, or (2) paying less on the student loan debt to save for a larger down payment?

personalfinance,"Paying off my loans using a credit card, encountering issues","Hey r/personalfinance, 

I'm going to start paying back my loans soon, and have allotted a $700/month amount as a base (could go up with bonuses I receive from my job). I have about $32k in debt, the majority of it being federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Nearly 5k of it is Perkins loans. 

Here's where things get tricky, though. As opposed to paying them off with my bank account, I want to use credit cards to pay them off. I'm getting into low-level churning, and basically treating my credit card as a debit card to earn rewards and the like. Unfortunately, I've got some issues:

1. Navient has me capped at $301/month payment with card. Anything after that must be taken out of my bank account. I saw some people on a FICO forum saying that Navient raised the minimum after the first month of payment and another request, but I wanted to make sure this was in fact true. 

2. Perkins loans, done through ECIS, are a bit trickier. I can pay off whatever amount I wish, but there's a mandatory 3.95 percent or so charge. I calculated how much extra I'd be spending on charges after paying off these loans, and it comes out to around $181. I don't want to spend $181 on an arbitrary cost, and I know that paying these loans off faster would ultimately reduce that annoying card charge. 

3. I would love to apply windfall to my loans, but Navient makes it so that your minimum (in my case, $300) is distributed evenly across the loans. Anything after that, which is deducted from your bank account, can target a specific loan. 

So, lots of different factors here. I kinda messed up and got Navient to change my IBR plan to a standard plan before checking the ECIS fees. I'm thinking I may just switch back to an IBR plan for Navient, and just pay off however much that is per month while putting more toward the loans with the attached fees.

I've got a house with a mortgage that is big but manageable for me.  About 10 years ago, I took out a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) on a little rental house that I still own.  I ran the HELOC up to over $50k before the housing bubble burst.  After the crash, my lender closed the HELOC for use, but I still owe the money, obviously.  

I've been making $200-$400 payments a month which covers interest but not much else.  I've paid it down $5,000 or so over the last 6 years, but it's still at $49,414.  Over that same time, I've opened and closed my own business, funded my retirement accounts to the ability that I am able, purchased the house I currently live in, but that HELOC just sits out there like a vulture on a pole.  

Yesterday I realized that I have $50k in cash or cash equivalents.  This also represents my entire safety net.  The HELOC is at 3.5% variable, tied to prime.  At that interest rate, every time I think about throwing a chunk of money at it, I put it in a college account or retirement, or sometimes I have to buy a car, etc.    

Am I doing the right thing?  With payments of $250 a month, it will take 25 years to pay off the HELOC at current interest rates, which obviously wont stay this low forever.   So I can ""kick this can down the road"" until my kids are out of college.  - OR - Should I throw a significant chunk at it now and reduce my monthly cash outflow to debt.  

I'm currently less well compensated from employment than I would like and making about $50k a year.  (these are real numbers by the way and the repeating $50k is a coincidence.)  My wife makes about $23k a year as well.  I pay $1,700 a month PITI for my primary residence.  I have no car loans or unsecured debt.  

What would you do?

My fiancé and I want to build a custom home for our two future children and us to live in. It has been a dream of mine since I was a kid to be a part of building my forever home from start to finish and she is 100% on board. We are pre-approved for $350k which (in Texas) is enough to get exactly what we want. Right now rates are still low so the monthly mortgage is comfortable on our current salaries. There are a few scenarios that I see playing out that I need help thinking through.

We could stay in our current house for 4-5 years and save up money while getting through our kid’s baby stages (day care is expensive for babies). Our current mortgage is about half of what the new house will be. So that equates to about $1250 a month extra going into savings while still being able to afford kid care, insurance increase, savings, retirement, ect.

Or we could go ahead and start the build process now while rates are low and the house we want is affordable. We will still be able to afford everything, just $1250 less a month into savings as it will be going to the mortgage instead. In the 3 months that we have been talking about it new home rates have already increased once upping the price of the house we want by 12k. So I imagine this trend will continue and our home will be out of our price range within a year.

So which scenario is better financially. Save more monthly but risk interest rates rising and home cost increasing exponentially. Or buy a house now while we can and not put as much into liquid savings.

This is a long post that I tried to condense, did I leave out any critical info that you need/want to help  me think things through?

personalfinance,"My husband (28) and I (29) paid off $37,000 of debt in 9 months. Here's our detailed budget, how we got into trouble, and how we're fixing it.","Sorry I missed the Triumphant Thursday thread, but what I have to share won’t fit in a single comment.

**The Problem**

First off, my husband and I both graduated from college within a year of each other (his masters degree, my bachelors) 4 years ago now. We got our first real grown up jobs, got married, and bought a house in quick succession. So much happened so fast and looking back I can clearly see how we let our families pressure us into buying a house before we were financially ready. Fast forward through being financially underprepared and naive, putting groceries on credit cards to come up with a down payment for said house, 4 major home accidents and repairs, and underestimating the weight of our student loans and the cost of owning a home… we found ourselves dug in a deep, deep hole and scared out of our minds. We were one unforeseen expense away from having to miss a payment or some other catastrophe.  I want to share what we’ve done to dig out of this to share our struggle, show off our success (!!!!!), and gain whatever advice/insight we can to continue this journey of self-improvement. 

At the beginning of April we agreed to look at our finances, watch our spending for a few weeks, learn our spending trends, and finally create a budget. We quickly realized we had no idea where our money was going, so we looked at our monthly income and subtracted our recurring bills from this. We realized that after paying our bills, we had $2300-$2600 left over each month. (It’s a range because I’m an hourly employee and my paychecks differ drastically when I occasionally pick up shifts or work holidays.) We always made our minimum payments and never missed a payment on anything. We thought we were being good and paying our bills! So why did we still feel so broke every month?!? Where was our money going?! This self-study taught us that we were spending so uncontrollably that we could barely track where we were bleeding money. So we put our entire tax return into debt reduction that very moment and set a goal to pay off our debts and live within our means. We thought we could realistically live off of $800/month to ensure $1500-1800 could be regularly applied to debt reduction each month. We agreed to break down the budget into categories, use cash only (an envelope system), and only make changes to the budget or categories when both partners agreed to it. (For some of you super frugals out there $800 may sound like a lot, but this was a HUGE lifestyle change for us who were spending so ignorantly.) I can break down the budget for you later.

To reduce our expenses, we rented out our “in-law suite” in our walkout-basement to our best friend. We knew he was a great tenant, but we drew up a contract and this arrangement has worked beautifully for us. It’s not for everyone and I advise extreme caution. We spent the first 2.5 months of our income from rent to furnish his apartment with appliances, making the space rentable. His contract guaranteed 6 months of rent, followed by a month-to-month basis. He’s lived with us for almost 2 years now, and he pays $550/month including utilities, internet, and cable. My husband and I also share a car for the time being. This is the biggest sacrifice for us, but we’ve been making it work for a year now! I also dyed my hair to its natural, boring color so I could stop spending stupid amounts of money to get highlights every 6 weeks. I’ve also learned the value of a good coupon. 

So let’s break down the debt hurt. I, the wife, have a very detailed spreadsheet detailing my student loan balances. I update this 1-2 times a month to make sure my autopay deductions are coming out, watch interest rates, etc. I never consolidated my loans because as a nurse I can qualify for federal loan forgiveness if I continue making payments, as I work for a non-profit. I started out owing ~$60k. I don’t have such a detailed account of my husband’s loans but he also started out at around $55k after grad school. Neither of us plan on returning to school anytime soon. Our mortgage principal is currently 184,000 (I know, young and stupid. I know, I know). 

[I also made a Debt Reduction spreadsheet.] (http://imgur.com/gallery/4tmwTJw) Some of the expenses you can see on it are credit card and loan debts. You can see the appliances we bought (Lowe’s) and furniture for the house. We had to replace some damaged windows and decided to replace half the windows in our house at once because they were all at risk of causing further damage soon. Then there’s the car payment. We repaired and covered our gutters because of more house damage that we will later find caused further unseen damage. (Yay!) In the first numeric column on the left side of the spreadsheet you can see that our total debt without considering student loans or mortgage was $38,748. Make that $90,233 with my student loans. Holy shit. Remember, I don’t even have my husband’s student loans on this spreadsheet. Guys, it hurts so much to look back at these numbers. Visceral pain.

 And we’re off!!! We start paying like champs. And then we’re immediately blindsided with more home damage and repairs. Bam! Water damage to chimney that requires a new sliding door.  And just for shits and giggles… let’s get a new furnace because ours is broken. And while we’re at it, let’s replace the water heater because it’s 5 years past its life expectancy and we can’t afford to be surprised by its impending rupture that would flood out our paying tenant. Intense, stabbing pain. $13,000 more debt added to the pile. Maybe 2015 just wasn’t our year.

**The Strategy**

Here’s what we do each month. I withdraw $800 cash from the bank. I write on the back of the deposit slip how I want the cash (X in $20s, Y in $10s, Z in $5s). I bring the money home and file into categories I’ve already planned out. [I use a folder like this from a dollar store.](http://www.ph.all.biz/img/ph/catalog/5953.jpeg) Here’s our current budget that works for us: 

**Groceries: $280.** This includes food, toilet paper, paper towels, cat food &amp; litter, cleaning supplies, etc.

**Entertainment: $140.** Includes meals out together, events with family and friends, hobbies, etc. This category is usually the first to get pulled from when we run short in others. 

**Gifts: $80.** I kid you not, we got slammed with 5 baby shower invites this month. I couponed the shit out of Buy Buy Baby. (Hint: They accept Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond Coupons).

**Personal Maintenance: $100.** Haircuts, replacing broken or worn out clothing, hair product, makeup staples. 

**Mad Money: $80 each.** New video game, manicures, Starbucks, or whatever I can’t seem to talk myself out of buying.

**Christmas: $40.** So we can still give gifts to our loved ones. They mean everything to us, but we’re being smart about our Xmas budget this year.

I also divide my wallet with [these](https://www.etsy.com/listing/158771958/tabbed-cash-dividers-for-envelope-system?ref=shop_home_active_2) so I’m not carrying around $800 at any given moment. I just shuffle the money between the wallet and file as needed. It helped to buy the dividers first and then go to Charming Charlie or Target with a coupon and buy a wallet they fit into. My current wallet setup cost me $12. (I swear I don’t know the shop owner, I just found and bought them to get us organized.) There are times when paying in cash is a huge inconvenience, so I’ll use my debit card and place the receipt in category X of my wallet. When I get home I move the money designated on the receipt from category X to a designated deposit envelope. I decorated this envelope with bright washi tape and keep it near our money file. When the deposit envelope gets somewhere over $30, I deposit the cash back into checking. 

We set out with a goal of keeping our checking account at ~$2000 as a buffer we’re both comfortable with. So after we pay our bills each month, we dump all the money left in checking (save the $2k buffer) into the debt category of our choosing. We began with paying off my Chase Freedom card because it had the lowest balance among the high-interest credit cards. We worked our way through the credit cards and most recently paid off our furnace and water heater. (We were so close to paying the furnace and water heater in full, but to keep our buffer in checking we put half on a credit card and paid it off 3 weeks later. Perhaps it wasn’t the wisest financial decision but we had our tenant to consider.) From here, our next big hurdle is paying off our windows and creating a savings to cover 6 months of living expenses. This may take a while.

**The Winning**

The total debt we have paid off in just 9 months is $36,996 not including my husband’s student loans. This includes the regular payments we’ve been making on or mortgage, student loans, and every loan/credit card we have. You can see on my sloppily thrown-together spreadsheet that not considering the payments on mortgage, we reduced our debt by $34,271. In just 9 months, we cleared out 9 credit cards and loans we were previously making monthly payments on. We’re incredibly fortunate our jobs and income were never altered during this time or I’d be sharing a different story. On r/favors. 

We don’t share this glory with family or friends because to reveal our greatest triumph of adult married life, we must shamefully admit how daft we were and how deep we were in over our heads. I’ll be so thrilled if even one person can be excited for us!

**The Future**

We feel that we’re still far from where we want to be, but we’ve come so far from the crushing grip of despair that debt had on us. We can breathe deeply and sleep a little easier. We can see a future in our home and can maybe discuss the possibility of children in the near future. We were so terrified of the cost of pregnancy before. Having a common goal to fight this hard for has been exhilarating in our marriage. We prod and encourage each other to make better decisions for a shared goal that also gives us hope. We’ve learned to appreciate our hard-earned money and the work we do. We respect our education and feel more pride in our careers. A simple date night is now more meaningful. Every gift is more precious. We feel we can take on more challenges as a team. Our house earned lots of equity. I’m on a first-name basis with a sweet, old bank teller.

Building up a savings is a must for us. It’s in the works. We also agree that because of our travel and off-shifts we can’t try to start a family before we have a second vehicle, so that is also in our distant plans. We welcome your suggestions. Thanks for reading! 

TL;DR: We used a cash &amp; envelope system to budget. Paid off $37,000 in debt in just under 9 months. Still more to go.

personalfinance,"$7,500 credit card debit, some medical debt - best strategy for paying off on $28k/yr income","I have a question on the best strategy for paying off my credit card debt. 

Long story short, I recently graduated from college and got a job. I'm not making a lot right now but there is potential for growth at the company I work for so I am still optimistic. When I got the job, I was making $24,000/year and wanted to ""be an adult"" so I started renting my own place. 

Turns out ""being an adult"" is really fucking expensive, between paying for bills and trying to pay for food and other expenses - I found myself in tons of credit card debt (I have a great credit score so I was approved for a $12,000 limit Discover card). 

So, two years later (this spring) I swallowed my pride and moved back in with my family so I could get this debt in check and save money. 

Relevant info - I'm eternally lucky to have parents who will let my 24 year old self live at home and not pay a single dime. The only thing they ask is for help around the house. So my only debt (besides medical) is my credit card. The balance today on my cc is $7500.00 with I think 15.9% interest rate.

After taxes, company insurance premiums, and stuff like my expenses are: 

* $50 gym membership (it's the cheapest in my town and I desperately need to lose weight)
* $120-150 gas (long commute for work)
* $100 fun stuff
* $300 monthly medical bill payment

This leaves me with about $800 a month to put towards savings and my credit card. 

I make just above the minimum payments on my credit card, usually like $200 and then save the rest of the money. 

Would I be better off putting huge chunks of money towards my credit card payment and not setting any aside for savings until it is paid off? 

Or just continue paying minimum payments for years?

I was looking at sofi.com which might give me a lower interest rate but was a bit leery about entering so much personal info into a random website before knowing if it was worth it. 

The other part of this is I am currently re-financing my home and wondering:
a) Should I, if possible, role this debt into the mortgage with the low 4.x% interest rate
b) Should I maybe not get the personal loan along with the re-fi right now as I may take a hit on my currently good credit.

I'm a MD/PhD student, looking forward to residency, lab set-up, then add clinical practice. Right now is the only freedom we will have to have kids, even though we can't really afford them. 


What we have going for us: 
 - We have plenty of space to welcome the child and we have worked out our schedules for him/her.
 - SO's sisters just finished having kids, so we'll inherit a bunch of stuff.
 - We both have relatively new cars, so won't have to worry about it for a while.
 - Supportive families, but neither of us are comfortable asking parents for financial support. We are pretending to be adults after all.
 - We're working towards advanced degrees? Not sure how much that means at this point. 


I have no illusions. We will have to take out student loans for kids because we apparently make too much for Medicaid and CHIP programs (Texas).

After a year things weren't improving, He's a pretty unpleasant man to be around 95% of the time - he's rude to customers, and he's going broke sooner rather than later as a result of poor business strategies/customer service, etc.  The divorce was also becoming more and more hostile and he was using company funds/labor to support it which I took issue with, so I left... 

The one up side is that as the bookkeeper, I processed the payroll (using Quickbooks payroll service) so I am at least confident that it was done properly during my time there and the payments actually got to the proper state/federal locations for my withholdings (otherwise I'd have absolutely ZERO confidence!) and thus I have my final pay stub for my employment there with my year-to-date earnings/withholdings, etc.

First, thank you in advance for taking the time to read this exhausting post.

Let’s starting with the basics: 
29/m, married, current salary $72K FERS-RAE and $6,168 ANG = $78K

28/f, spouse, current salary ~ $18K from local employment
*I met with a financial consultant at the end of 2014, we spent a few hours going over everything.  His major concern was that my rent was almost 40% of my take home pay but liked what I have so far established.

-8 years of ANG service, E5.  3yrs were active duty at E4
-3 years of FERS-RAE, GS11-4, purchased my 3yrs of military service back.
-2.2 years of OEF, reducing ANG pension collection to age 58


Current Contributions:
ANG: Traditional 7% | Roth: 7% - Bonus, Danger Pay, Special Pay = 10% but all prior contributions have been 100% or 50%

FERS: Traditional: 5% | Roth: 10%
Me: 1x monthly $500 transfer to savings
Spouse: 1x monthly $500 transfer to savings

Past TSP contributions have been
ANG: 10% Traditional, 100% Bonus
FERS: 10% Traditional, 5% match


Current Balances:
ANG: ~60K w/allocations C-S-I 40/20/40 – After lots of PF, bobblehead, MMM and FI reading, I should adjust I to 20%, hoping for a Santa Rally first.
FERS: ~34K w/same allocations – same thoughts - considering dropping my I allocation to 20 once there is a bit of a swing to recoup the $600 loss this year.

USAA: ~1K Roth IRA in a few foreign ETF that are not doing so well

USAA: ~1,500 in random MMJ stocks – also not doing well - now worth &lt;700

Joint Savings: $22K - considering DoC post on 5% savings accounts ; Primary Checking: $5K ; Secondary Checking: $5K ; CashBack Checking: $1,500

We don’t eat out, the occasional food truck for lunch, we had 2 mini vacations and 1-10 day (expensive) but I dabble in the credit card game at r/churning to help mitigate the cost. Honestly, I haven't found where we can lean out even more of expenses.  I probably need to do YNAB to really track those misc charges.


Estimated Retirement Earnings/Pension

ANG 
6yrs of service for 2,080 points * 2.5 = 14.45% - I don’t think it will be any less than this

20yrs @ E6 = $3,724.20 * 14.45% = $538.1469 * 12 = $6,456

20yrs @ E5 = $3,125.70/m * 14.45% = $451.66365 * 12 = $5,412


FERS-RAE:
Early Retirement: 57 – there is a onetime window at age 55 to start collecting TSP w/out penalty.  If I’m still working with FERS, than I anticipate early retirement.
20yrs * 1% = 20% * $70,000 = $14,000

***Does this mean we can make an AGI of 85K and the standard deductions will drop us down to 15%?

Current Estimated Earnings and Contributions:
Today I went down the rabbit whole of HDHP + HSA to see about the additional investment opportunities.  Since I can’t max out my TSP I didn’t think it was worth to follow through but I’ll share the data I was considering.  Both plans contribute $1,200 a year.  The minute I sign up my FSA is converted to a limited Expense FSA and can be used for Dental/Vision only.  2015 FSA contribution will be $500.  May end up using the FSA if this work related injury is not approved.

AETNA HDHP: $129/pp ($3,354) their HSA administrator is BNY Mellon that does have access to 3x Vanguard options VSCGX, VSMGX, VDAIX – the first two are mildly appetizing.  $2/m admin fee and 
GEHA HDHP: $116/pp, their administrator is HSA Bank and has access to TD Bank and Devenir investments w/no monthly fees
My current health plan is APWU for $110/pp ($2,860) that comes with a $2400 upfront PSA.  This has treated us pretty good minus their customer service and claim process. If you can tolerate this than it’s good.

I contributed $20/pp to an FSA to keep $500 in a rollover status.  I lowered 2016 contributions to $10/pp for $200
You can make it overly complicated and w/d HSA funds and pay for your own administrator to have access to much better Vanguard investment options but by now I’m just feeling overwhelmed. FEHB is the worst.

But seriously, what TSP method should I choose for 2016?  It seems important to keep our joint income in the 15% Fed and 5.75% State tax brackets. I could be wrong, please share
72K FERS + 6K DoD + 18K = $95,000
$95K - 12,400 = $82,000 - 73,000 = $9,000 difference

I did really well -- graduated with highest honors, won the highest award in my department, etc. My sister helped me apply for college when I was 17, and signed me up for all of the loans and grants and stuff I needed. I'm autistic and I struggle a lot with understanding the language in loan agreements, communicating with people about finances, navigating complex situations that stack coordinating with people to help me settle financial obligations, stuff like that. So I really honestly didn't know what I was getting into when I went to college, and after graduating, my sister would no longer help me figure everything out with this stuff. 

I'm currently in default on my student loans. A couple of years ago I called the fedloan people over and over again and finally got them to explain to me how to start getting my loans under an income based repayment plan. First I had to consolidate all of them. It took me months to get the paperwork together, but I did, and sent it in, and they were consolidated. Then they said in order to change my payment plan to something I could afford, I needed to send them in my tax information. But I never filed for taxes, because I haven't made enough to be required to. I wanted to file anyway, but without the urgent necessity behind it (the needing to), my family wouldn't help me, so I didn't. So I wasn't able to send them the paperwork required. I am also not without income, as I make a small amount of money each month through art commissions, but when I asked them how I could report that income without tax documents, they were unhelpful. I went to H&amp;R Block and asked them what to do, and they told me that in order to file taxes I would need to keep records of all of my purchases relating to the business as well as the income I make from it. So I've been doing that, but beyond that, I haven't known what to do to proceed. I think in order to get my loans out of default, I will need to file my taxes, and then present those documents to the loan people, so they can adjust my payments to something I can afford. I hope that all makes sense/sounds right so far?

But beyond that information I am very lost. I'm confused about who I should be contacting now that my loans are in default. I'm also confused about what I do with the information I have on my purchases and income with my art so I can file taxes. I'm even confused about when I should be filing taxes and what dates they start from. 

I feel like this probably all sounds really babyish and I'm so sorry if it's tedious, and I'm sure it is. I just want to be more self sufficient, and I want to be able to take care of these things on my own. If anyone can help me walk through all of this stuff, it would mean a lot to me. 

Sidenote: I considered going to graduate school to eventually be able to get a better job than doing art, because it's obviously nearly impossible to find a job that pays more than minimum wage right now with a BA in English, and I currently make more than minimum wage doing art now... so that's why I'm doing that instead of working a traditional job. But again, the paperwork and application process is very overwhelming to me. It's hard, because I know I'm capable of doing the work necessary but find myself constantly disoriented by these pre-requisite sort of things, such as in the case of filing taxes or communicating with someone on adjusting my loan payments. 

I also think I owe a lot of money for medical fees, but I'm not sure how to find out what I owe... and I would like to get those taken care of soon too, since my mother stopped paying them like she had been since the last couple of years.

financialindependence,First Reddit Post. Turned 37 Today. Can I Still FIRE?,"I'm basically looking to get a variety of opinions to help me decide. I have been saving aggressively (75-80%) since I graduated pharmacy school in 2005 at age 26. My wife is 34. We have no children and neither of us want them. I have been working as a retail pharmacist for over 10 years and averaged 41 hours per week. I am currently making $63/hr, but I reduced myself to 32 hours last year due to stress from the job. I hate people, particularly the ones who frequent a pharmacy to solve their problems. I have enormous problems with the hypocrisy of what I'm doing, which is basically enabling irresponsible people to continue their lives of irresponsibility. It is sometimes difficult for me to breathe at home and work. 

This is roughly a $130k/yr job. The bonus, 401k match, and other benefits take it to about $150k/yr. I pay no state income tax. My wife just started a 25 hour per week job making $9/hr just to have something to do. She really likes it, has no plans of quitting, and would probably do it for free. The house and acreage are worth $300k and completely paid off. We custom built the house and went way over code, so unforeseen expenses should be minimal. My student loans are $83k (2.8%) but my father has repeatedly refused my offers to pay them out of a determined sense of parental obligation. (I don't want to just send a lump sum and pay them off myself because of the great interest rate.) Other than the student loan, we are debt free. We have one vehicle that has a good 10 years left in it. Material wise, we have basically everything we want, but we like to travel.

Specific finances (after an absolutely brutal past two weeks in the market): $300k house equity (as mentioned earlier), $11k in emergency fund (cash account earning 1%), $428k in 401k/tIRA/Roth (Vanguard Small Cap Index Fund), $254k in savings (50/50 in Vanguard International Fund and US Muni Bond Fund). $39k in ESPP (will vest in one year). Our spending for 2013-2015 has consistently been $38k/yr. If I retire, our spending will decrease to $28k-30k (no more driving for my job [$1k], no need to keep the second vehicle [$1k], more time to cook at home instead of eating out [$1k], smarter shopping at the grocer [$1k], ACA subsidies[$3k], more flexible vacation planning [$1k]). This is still living what I consider to be a very easy lifestyle. Cutting back to $20k-25k is not out of the realm of possibility for us if the market collapsed. We have no medical bills and are very healthy.

One other financial note is a potential inheritance. My parents (age 70 and 71) have a current net worth of $600k (mostly in real estate) and live frugally and happily on their SSI. Their will is that I get 50%. My wife would perhaps get a similar amount from her parents. I have a lot of inexpensive hobbies and interests, but none look particularly promising as a form of supplemental income. I've crunched the numbers on firecalc dozens of times using a variety of scenarios, but as you might expect, I'm nervous about leaving such a high paying job that I could NEVER get back due to the abundance of new graduates. I have applied for 30-40 other pharmacy positions but received no offers. I'm very good at my job but the company has a strict no rehire policy. If I leave, the door is closed. More than happy to answer questions. A very terrible December thus far in the market has me very nervous. So what would you do? Thanks for your help.",finance,1449930712

Although I do live with my parents, I give them about 400$ a month to help out around the house with some utilities and also pay for my part of the family cellphone bill. Besides that my only expense is really my car payment and insurance, which runs me at about 429 for the car plus 110 for the insurance. My credit was in the mid 600s at the time and got approved for a relatively high interest rate (8%) on my 60 month car loan (the car was 18,900$ plus taxes and fees). I have paid off the car for 15 months now and the payoff is 17k. I have no student loans, i recently went back to a community college and have a semester left there and have been paying out of pocket. I have about 50$ in my savings account and that is why I'm here, I want to manage my money better.

I also have a 2000$ balance on my credit card that i have been paying off (it was 5k at one point) and that was mainly created by living outside my means.

I'm an active contributor to the sub, and you've helped me change my life around from someone in $10,000 in credit card debt to someone with a budget, savings, retirement, and aiming for /r/financialindependence.

I finished up my approximate 2016 budget yesterday, and everything looks to be in order.  [High-level picture included](http://imgur.com/jF30hob).  I have a much more detailed breakdown but that's not really relevant to this post.  My information breakdown is as follows:

* Income - About $45000 after tax and insurance

* Expenses - All mandatory bills, from rent to internet.  I've gone over them with a fine-tooth comb, there's nothing I'm willing to sacrifice, save for maybe $200 in an emergency.

* Other - Non-mandatory expenses, I'm much more flexible here
 * Retirement - Maxed out IRA, Maxed out employer match, nothing extra

 * Debts - $8500 car at 3%, $65000 (federal) student loans at ~6%

 * Savings - This is flexible money that can be dumped into any category, including upgrading my E-fund.  My buffer for financial mistakes is also included in here.

With this breakdown, I should be debt-free with an ~90k retirement in 7 years (early 30's), assuming no major changes.

**QUESTION:**

Am I done?  Is the breakdown about in line with what it should be?  What do I do next?  Can I improve on anything at a high level, and if so, what?

I'm finishing up my Masters degree next semester so I guess the next step for me is to chase income increases, but is that really it?

personalfinance,A distant relative passed away recently. He was apparently extremely wealthy but I had no clue.,"So I was told yesterday that a distant relative of mine passed away.  He was in his late 80s so it wasn't unexpected or anything.  I had met him only a handful of times.  The times I had he struck me as a middle class guy basically.  His clothes were old fashioned and a little worn.  He drove a beater car.  When we went out to restaurants he always ordered one of the cheaper menu items even more so if it was a deal where everyone was paying their own way.  He would caution me against wasting money on junk if I was going to buy some cheap souvenir on vacation.

I commented to the person who told me he had passed away that the last time I saw him he gave me twenty bucks in a red envelope.  I commented that this wasn't much money, but I knew he didn't have much so I considered it very generous of him considering I didn't know him well at all.  I was then told that the guy had a net worth in the tens of millions of dollars.

I'm kind of blown away to be honest.  I never would've guessed in a million years that he had that much wealth.  If I had to guess I would've guessed he was just another elderly person getting by on social security and a government pension (he retired after many years working for the feds).

personalfinance,At what interest rate would it be worth cashing out an old 401k to help pay off student loans?,"Hey PF!

Long story short, I have a 401k from an old employer that I completely forgot about until recently--valued at $7,000. I also have roughly $85,000 left in student loans, ranging from 2.3% to 5.9%--the majority of which are towards the lower end of 5%. I already have a healthy 401k with my current employer, and am on track with my retirement plans before I completely blanked out on remembering I had this old 401k. Now, if I don't cash it out--ill probably roll it over to an IRA with my current 401k holder (Fidelity). This may not be the most financially sound choice, but I don't want to bother managing two retirement plans.


My question is---should I just eat the extra 10% in order to pay a decent chunk of my student loan debt at 5.9%? If I understand correctly, Ill still get hit with the taxes if/when I roll that amount over to an IRA--so the 10% may not be a huge impact considering the value.

This is a terrible idea for so many reasons.

First, there are moral hazard implications. Easy access to money can lead to inflated wedding expenses. Additionally, the expectation that the loan will never have to be paid would most likely mean that it will never be accounted for in budgets, which is especially problematic for high-interest loans.

You then also have to remember that divorces can be unilateral. Even if you're willing to be in your relationship forever, your spouse might want out. So in addition to all the stresses of divorce and splitting assets, you will be on the hook for one additional huge expense, that's been accruing interest for a long time.

Finally, this entire business model is most appealing to couples with financial difficulties to pay for their ""dream wedding."" Financial hardships are a huge burden to couples and a large contributor to divorces. They're basically targeted to relationships they expect to fail. I also love the nonsense where they claim to charge higher interest rates to the couples they expect to succeed. Surely all rates will be high, and people who are offered exorbitant rates will misinterpret it as an expectation of marital success, when it really is about maximization of revenue. 

There is no other way to describing the success of this enterprise as them betting on your marriage to fail. You're basically signing a prenup with a third party that ensures both parties will be screwed over in a divorce.

personalfinance,401K questions - are these expense ratios correct?,"I have been lurking here for some time and am trying to begin understanding my 401k.  The sidebar has helped me understand somewhat, but I still have questions.

&amp;nbsp;


At work we received a packet with investment profiles of what is offered by our 401k.  After reading here, I took the time to look at the expense ratios and now I'm totally disappointed.  Most of them says 1.0% or higher.  Just to give a breakdown here is how I'm currently set up.  For background, I'm 31 and 8 years ago when I was hired, the financial guy we had at the time advised me to set it up this way.

&amp;nbsp;


Federated Kaufmann Large Cap R (KLCKX): 30.75%  
Federated Equity Income R (FDERX): 22.65%  
Federated International Leaders R (FGFRX): 16.75%  
Federated Kaufmann R (KAUFX): 13.45%  
Federated MDT All Cap Core R (QKACX): 10.56%  
Federated Kaufmann Small Cap R (FKKSX): 5.83%  

&amp;nbsp;


Am I really reading these expense ratios correctly?  Because they seem horrible.  One is listed as 1.96%!  If so, from what I have read, I should probably just put in enough to get my company match (which I am currently doing) and dump the rest elsewhere.

&amp;nbsp;


My second question about diversifying.  The profiles show what the funds are made up of (i.e. 70% US stocks, 10% non-US stocks, etc).  How does that relate to trying to get X amount in US stock, Y amount in non-US stock, Z amount in bonds?  Do the Federated Kaufmann R and Federated Equity Income R only count toward my US stock allocation because they are primarily made up of US stocks, or do I have to take into account that they have non-US stocks too?

The payment should be about $1600 before utilities inclusive of everything else.

I accepted an overseas assignment starting in the next 6 months to a year. On this assignment they will pay for my housing abroad. They will also pay a property management company to rent my home in Miami for the 2-5 years I am away. 

I realize most of the cost of the payment is interest but I could get 5 years of payments while I am away.

The other important factor is that after my assigment I have a choice not to return to Miami but to another US city. At that point I could sell the home if I needed to.

I can completely understand the frustration and despair at what appears to be an overwhelmingly powerful financial industry designed to generate massive profit off of people's attempts to improve their lives through education. 

***However, I always remember that the school I went to, the major I enrolled in, and the debt I signed for, was my decision. I signed for my debt with a full legal consent of the applicable interest rate, period of repayment, and principle amount to be repaid. Everything was clearly explained to me. I was neither tricked nor lied to.***

Enrolling in a major for college that may seem employable, DOES NOT GUARANTEE EMPLOYMENT upon graduation. If you take student loans when you go to college, YOU WILL HAVE TO REPAY THOSE LOANS WHEN YOU GRADUATE REGARDLESS OF YOUR EMPLOYMENT STATUS OR YOUR ANNUAL INCOME. 

I formed this tough advice because I myself have experienced setbacks with my career that I totally did not account for. I went to school for Bioengineering and took out loans to do so. In fact I went because I was sold on the career prospects for bioengineering in the coming years. I graduated to find that bioengineers are seen as a jack of all trades and a master of none, and are not very desirable on a medical device design team. 

I certainly have the urge to feel like I was tricked by my choice of major at my school. But I remind myself that I signed for my loans and I knew and accepted the risks.

personalfinance,"3rd year law student, I've been offered a Christmas bonus but I'm concerned I can't afford the increased income tax liability unless I can find enough deductions.","My boss told me on Friday I would be receiving a $5,000 Christmas bonus. I'm trying to buy a house within the next few weeks and it would be great to have the extra money, but I'm concerned that it would actually cost me more to accept the bonus in increased tax liability. I'm a 3rd year law student who hasn't taken tax law so please correct me if any of my assumption here are incorrect. This is all new to me.

I live in a state with no income tax. From Jan - April of this year I made  $8,052.77 in hourly pay of which $1,125.04 was withheld for  taxes. From May - Dec I made $28,000.00 in salary with no income tax withholdings. 

Federal Income Tax Brackets:

$9,226 to $37,450: **15%**

$37,451 to $90,750: **25%**
        
Without the bonus I had $36,052.77 in income which would puts me in the 15% bracket with a $5,407.92 tax liability. Which is what I've been putting money aside for.

The bonus puts my income at $41,052.77, in the 25% tax bracket, with a tax liability of $10,263.19.

I've paid $167 in interest on my car payment over the year and probably about $300 in textbooks but I don't believe I have any other deduction.

However, I do have $95,000 in student debt of which about $9,000 is interest.

Is it possible for me to make a $4,000 payment against the interest on my student debt to get my adjusted gross income back down into the 15% tax bracket?

personalfinance,I have 6k(potentially 10k+) in savings but still would like access to it. Best way to save/grow? Or should I make student loan payments(20k debt),"I currently have 6k in a savings account. I believe within the next 4 months I will be able to contribute to get that to 11k. I am wondering what the best and safest options to try to ""grow"" this money is.

- I would like to be able to have access to the money, almost at all times, but can budge on this to a degree

-I would like to have the most minimal to no risk of losing the money

Also, I am currently a grad student  (student loan payments aren't required.) Over the last two years I have paid my debt from 35k to 20k. Also get a cool paper at tax time to claim 2.5k of the interest I've paid on my loans. I will be getting it again this year. I have federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans, the majority are collecting interest, some won't until I graduate.


I am thinking of dropping out of graduate school and moving to a place with 3x cost of living. I've basically stopped making large loan payments to save money to supplement the income I will be making. Also I will be required to make loan payments.
-is it better to save money in anticipation of this, or should I be paying more of my student loan balance off and have a smaller savings?

Edit: my loans, most are unsubsidized (collect interest while in school) at 6.8%, others will collect ~4% when I leave school. I've only been paying off the unsubsidized so far. Links: http://imgur.com/R5WO5Ab

I feel like I have most of my finances in order but I know I am making a few mistakes.  I know I spend WAY too much money on food specifically.

I am 30 years old, make approx. 85k a year.  Monthly take home is roughly $1750 bi-weekly.  I budget that I have $3500 to work with a month.  I am single and have no kids. 

Just bought a house and mortgage and escrow is $2280 a month, this will reduce to roughly $2150 next year as I bought a cheaper insurance plan.  I receive $1280 in rental income a month (house is a duplex, rent other half)

I have a $150 a month car payment for the next 4 years.
Other expenses (car insurance, internet, utilities, etc) are about $550.
No CC debt, no student loans.

$5500 in savings.
130k in 401k (federal gov't employee so TSP)
I put about $13k a year into my 401k.

I need to save money to pay for a new AC system in my house and general repairs.  Would like to have about 10k to do this.  

I use mint to track my spending and while I spend about $200 a month on “shopping” (which is mostly amazon for stuff I either want/need) consistently and I will spend anywhere from $500 to $1000 a month on groceries/food total.  A lot of that can be going out on dates and what not but that seems to be where my issues are.  
Should I cut back on my 401k to save up for repairs?  Or just slowly build up my savings to do it?",finance,1450021284
personalfinance,Deciding between Seattle area and NYC,"About me: New grad in May 2016, Male, student debt at ~80k. I'm incredibly flexible at this point in my life. I am not tied down to anything and really all I'm looking to do is get rid of my student loans and achieve strong financial security. I do value living in a city since I'm so young and need easier access to nightlife and people.

I have a job offer with a tech company in Seattle and I'm still interviewing with a couple companies in NYC. For the first 4 years in Seattle my taxable income will fall at ~130k. There is no state tax which is awesome, and though the property is slightly more expensive, I am single and can probably find a nice place to rent at 1,500/month. 

I am also in the interview process with a company in NY and I am wondering if it is financially disadvantageous to take this offer if I do get it. What I expect is an annual taxable income of 180k when 30k of that is from bonus. So in NY there is a state tax and city tax which fall at annual rates of 6.65 and 3.6 respectively (i believe) with average rent being 3k, I think I would probably look for either a roommate or just bite the bullet on a higher rent like 3.5k/month just for the opportunity to live in the city.

My NY formula looks like (180000 - (180000 * (.036 + .0665))) - (3500 * 12) = 119550 not accounting for federal tax, medicare, 401k contributions, and anything else i'm forgetting

My Seattle formula looks like (130000 - (1500 * 12)) = 112000 not accounting for the same things plus 15k of that comes from from capital gains which gets taxed for 15% and 3.x% for obamacare I believe...

Somehow I feel like 130k in seattle should go much further than 180k in NYC but I'm not really sure what else to account for other than rent and state/city income tax.

What does pf think? Which seems like a smart offer to take, and if the Seattle offer is better, what amount of money in NYC can give the same standard of living as what I would have in Seattle?",finance,1450021286

financialindependence,Would you go in to a Vanguard Index fund now given market uncertainties?,"Season's Greetings. 

My 401(k) is in 100% stocks and I am comfortable with the volatility for the next 10 years because I own a good rental property as a hedge (bought well, good and stable local real estate market, $6k/20% annual ROI after taxes). I am asking this here rather than /r/personalfinance because frankly this sub just seems more sophisticated.

I am considering whether to go 100% into the Vanguard S&amp;P index fund that I discuss below but I question whether volatility around the Fed rate increase and poor retail sales makes it better to wait until January. 

My 401(k) is 20% in a Vanguard extended market S&amp;P index fund with a net expense ratio of 0.08% and 10 year average annual returns of +8.32%. 

The other 80% of my 401(k) is in an equities mutual fund that holds 17 funds with net expense ratios that are mostly between 0.50% and 1.15%. A few of them beat the Vanguard fund's 10 year annual return but many do not, and 25% of the holdings are in foreign stocks which I don't like right now.

The past few months haven't been great for stocks - the Vanguard index has returned -1.17% since I got into it a year ago while the mutual funds have returned -4.34% during that time. However the mutual funds may hedge volatility a little better than the S&amp;P over the next few months.

My husband and I had a conversation about this and he said that interest rates are low and California real estate is always going to increase so it makes sense to just buy at minimum required and watch it appreciate over time while putting the rest of your money in stocks.

Anyway, just curious what is PF opinion on putting more than a 20% downpayment? Is it superfluous? Or something that's smart?",finance,1450024274

We had to replace my wife's car earlier this year (replaced 2007 Saturn Vue w/ 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium). This was expected and financially easily doable. For my wife a car is something that should get you from point A to B safely and comfortably. She loved the Subaru, and we are both very happy with the purchase. It fit within our budget and we will probably pay it off early.


Replacing my car is unexpected. I was driving a 2005 Saturn Vue 3.5L V6. It had ~130K miles on it. I hit a deer on the way to work last week. Insurance totaled the car and offered a $5300 payout. We decided the smartest move long term would be to take the money and replace it rather than fixing the car. So in one year we're going from zero car payments to two car payments. I do hate car payments, but I like driving. I wasn't expecting to replace the Vue for another 2 - 3 years.

My ideal car was a 4 door hot hatch with a manual transmission: reliable long term, family friendly, good MPG, fun to drive daily driver.

I'm trying to decide between these:

A new 2015 Mazda3 S Hatchback Grand Touring: Automatic transmission, fully loaded (leather, adaptive cruise, all the nice electronic safety stuff, etc) for $26067 + tax/title/tags.

**OR**

A new 2016 Golf GTI SE 4 door w/ lighting package and driver assist package (adaptive cruise, all the nice electronic safety stuff) for $29943 + tax/title/tags. I get VW ""partnership pricing"" through my work so I the price is dealer invoice -$500.

**OR**

~2014 - 2015 used of either model

I've test driven both. I really liked the Mazda. It is a super nice car. I LOVED the VW.

We're going to dip into savings and put $10K down no matter which car we get to minimize the payments. I'm financed @ 1.9% APR for 60 months through PenFed.

My practical, financially savvy side is doing armageddon with my less practical, emotional side. The practical side of me says get the Mazda. It's the better deal financially, and long term reliability is (anecdotally) better. Ideally, I would like to keep the car at least 10 years/150K miles. My heart says I enjoy driving when I have to, and I would like it to be really fun. My practical side says the Mazda is ""fun enough"". The wife really wants me to go for the Mazda, but is ""ok"" with the VW.The Mazda comes with all the bells and whistles, minus the manual six-speed, for $5K less, takes regular gas, insurance is cheaper, and gets better MPG.The GTI comes with the same bells and whistles, but cost extra, is SUPER FUN, takes premium (for ideal performance), insurance is a little more expensive, and gets good but not Mazda3 good MPG.

Help me decide.",finance,1450033561

personalfinance,Help understanding my paycheck and taxes,"I've decided that it's a good idea to fully understand the ins and outs of my paycheck and tax liability. Part of this is because I want to better understand federal and state withholdings (I'm currently claiming 0, which I know is way too high), and part of this is because I want to be able to get a better understanding of what effect increasing pre-tax deductions (401k and HSA) will have on my take-home pay.

I'm a bit confused by some of the dollar figures I'm seeing on the breakdown of my paycheck - they don't add up to what I'm coming up with on my own.

#Quick background:
I'm married and live in Colorado. Right now, my wife does not work. I'm only trying to understand my paycheck, not our overall household's. Our current Federal and State withholdings are Married, claiming 0.

Gross Income | Bi-Weekly | Annually

#Paycheck Info
This information comes directly from my paycheck. All values represent a bi-weekly deduction.

Post-Tax Deductions|Amount
---|---
AD&amp;D|$2.10
Voluntary Life|$8.40
***Total***|***$10.50***

**Question 1**: For the section below, it says 'Taxable Benefits' - does that mean that I have to pay taxes on it? Or does that mean that my employer does?

Employer Paid Benefits and Non-Cash Taxable Benefits|Amount
---|---
Basic Life Insurance|$3.94 
Business Travel Accident Insurance|$10.86 
EAP ER Contribution|$0.77 
Employer Paid Dental|$16.94 
Employer Paid Medical|$274.79

Long Term Disability|$3.98 
Short Term Disability|$31.72 
Telehealth Services|$0.34 
***Total***|***$466.43***

**Question 2**: For the section below, I would have assumed that my taxable wages would simply be my Gross Income ($4,107.70) minus my Pre-Tax Deductions ($495.50), which would be $3,612.20. Obviously this is not the case - why? Why isn't my state listed here? ~~Why are the OASDI and Medicare taxable wages different than the Federal?~~ Edit: As others have stated, they are different due to OASDI and Medicare taxing 401k contributions.

Taxable Wages|Amount
---|---
OASDI|$3,785.42
Medicare|$3,785.42
Federal Withholding|$3,542.97

After all of the above is taken into account, my **take-home pay** is $2,683.62

# Tax Questions
Note: I obtained all of the information for my annual numbers by taking all of the bi-weekly numbers and multiplying them by 26.

Given the following:

Description|Amount
---|---
Gross Salary|$106,800.20 
Pre-Tax Deductions|$12,883.00 
Taxable Income|$93,917.20

I would expect my federal tax bracket to look like the table below (given that I'm married, filing jointly).

**Question 3**: Does this look correct to you?

Rate|Min|Max|My Tax Rate
---|---|---|---
10%|$0|$18,550.00|$1,855.00

**Question 4:** Assuming the above table is correct, my total **Federal** taxes owed for the year would be just over $15,021.80 (or $577.76 per bi-weekly paycheck). However, my current bi-weekly federal tax deduction is $479.49, which is nearly $100 less than what my calculations are coming up with.

personalfinance,Stuck in a deep hole because of a auto loan and I'm looking for some advice.,"ill do my best to provide all the information needed but if i miss anything just mention it and ill update.

Ok, so I'm a 22 year old male i make roughly 35.5k a year.
my monthly expenses include:

1) car payment $625

2) car insurance $300

3) Rent/Utilities $200


on August 1st 2015 I traded in my 2010 subaru outback for $8,500 but I owed $13,500 on so going in i was -$5,000

what I then purchased was a 2015 subaru BRZ limited with a sticker price of $27,500. they then added on a Service contract, maintenance, spare key, and a car alarm all add up to around $5,850.

so with a quick recap the sticker price was $27,500 + $5,000 (from previous loan) + $5,850 (addons)  + $3,650 (sales tax and other fees) = $42,000 

so the exact loan amount is $42,051.48 and my interest rate is 6.490% so after all is said and done the full loan amount is $52,575.60

now I can *afford* this but not responsibly.

bi weekly i bring home around $1k. what I have set up is $500 out of every check goes into my ""car account"" so $1k every month and my car payment and car insurance automatically come out of this account leaving an extra $75 every month. so with that being said im left with $1000 per month and then take out the rent/utilities and that puts me at $800. but here is my main issue... my work commute is roughly 100 miles round trip... my car gets about 3.5 trips to and from work per tank so ill usually fill up every 3 business days at about $30 a tank so there being roughly 20 business days in a month that's about 7 fill ups and we will add 2 more tanks for weekend use so a total amount of gas per month being $270. so that $800 is now $530. I don't necessarily have a food budget (i should probably work on that) because i often just eat with the family at home.
so I'm left with $530 a month for ""other"" expenses such as social events, food, entertainment.

with all that being said time to ask the real question. 

what can i do to lower my monthly payments to something much more manageable?
the only real idea i have is to just save and refinance in 2017 but my concern is that it only took me 4 months to reach 10k miles on my car so if i wait till march 2017 i could be at 50k+ miles and i feel like the value of the car would drop a lot by then but I have no idea by how much.

Last minute thought i figured i should add! i put 6% of my income into my 401k and my company matches 5%. until this year they only matched 4% so thats why i chose 6% so that with the companies 4% i would be at 10% so hypothetically i can go down to 5% and still be at the 10% i want or would it not be worth it?

any and all advice will be greatly appreciated

To try and calculate what my paychecks will look like.. Now, this site has always worked for me before and I believe it's working now however **I'm trying to understand why it's saying i'll be paying about $24,000 in taxes next year**... It seems like way too much. 

**Manually calculating just my federal income taxes came to $13,918.35** -- Not sure if I used the correct method but I calculated the amount I'd have to pay based on each tax bracket - 10%,15%,25% using the difference between the upper limit of the bracket from the bottom. e.g. @ 10% I did ($9,225 - $0) * .10 = $922.5. Added the results from doing the same for the remaining two brackets and got to $13,918.35.

The information I entered on the PaycheckCity salary calculator is as follows: 

Gross Pay                          - $72,500.00  
Gross Salary YTD               - $0.00  
Pay Frequency                   - Bi-weekly  
Federal Filing Status          - Single  
Number of Federal Allowances     -2  
Additional Federal Withholding - $0.00  
State for withholding               -New Jersey  
Total Allowances                    - 0  
Additional State Withholding   - 0  
New Jersey SDI                     - true  
Rate code                             - A  
New Jersey SUI                     - true  
Exempt State                        - false  
Filing Status                          - S  

**The results were:** 

Bi-weekly Gross Pay        - $2,788.46  
Federal Withholding         - $436.30  
Social Security                - $172.88  
Medicare                        - $40.43  
New Jersey                    - $106.83  
SUI                               - $11.85  
FLI                                - $2.51  
SDI                               - $6.97  
Net Pay                         - $2,010.69  

**Multiplying the Net Pay by 2 for each pay check in a month gives me:  $4,021.38 - Multiplied by 12 for the year puts my at $48,256.46 in net income, meaning 24,243.44 went to taxes.** 

Can someone enlighten me as to what I'm not understanding if the paycheckcity calculation is correct or if it's wrong what process should I be following to get the correct calculation if mine was wrong..

Thanks in advance! &amp; Sorry for the wall of text!

personalfinance,Starting to payback student loans via Nelnet. Why can't I use a cash back credit card?,"(Using a throwaway here since I'm not comfortable linking this info to my main account.)

I have recently begun paying back my student loans in full force via Nelnet, the ever-present loan servicer (at least for most of my friends and I). Rather than using the auto-debit feature (which I see as extremely lazy) I have been paying back my two loans manually via the avalanche method (which I found here, thanks /r/personalfinance!), paying minimum on the one with lower interest rate and dumping a large sum on the one with the highest. So far, I'm doing well. My debt is decreasing and I'm budgeting my money as wisely as I could have ever hoped.

I got to thinking the other day though, why can't I use a cashback credit card? If I'm making consistent payments, will be doing so for a while, and ensure I never carry a balance on the card, I don't see why this isn't a bad option for me. Of course I ask this because after looking into it I found Nelnet does not allow payment via credit card, at least on the online portal. I have yet to check if they allow you to do so through the mail.

Has anyone found a work around to Nelnet's bs? Of course I don't have a problem sticking with debit, but I'd rather have these damn loans work a bit in my favor.",finance,1450047786
personalfinance,"I can't decide if I should pay my new car payment in full, or if I pay monthly with an interest rate of 3.25%","I paid a down payment of $2,500, and now I have a car loan of $18,780.  A couple of reasons I can think of to pay it monthly instead of in cash right now:


1.) If I invest it in an index fund, it I might be able to eclipse the money lost from the loan interest

2.) I will have a large loan in my credit history, which may help me with getting a home loan in a couple of years (I need input if this is valid).  I have a FICO credit score of 736, and it was 762 a couple months ago before this loan and new credit card.

personalfinance,I'm young (25) and would like to ask for a raise due to an increased workload. Am I going about this the right way?,"This is pretty long and I apologize, I'm attempting to be detailed. I appreciate any help, advice, or recommendations.

I work for a College in Virginia and I believe I'm being significantly underpaid. My current job consists of two portions. The main half being quality control and monitoring of a statewide realtime database system and its components. The second half is operations and security of a closed testing site used for research. I've been at this job for a year and 6 months. The training was long and the protocols are extremely tight and ever changing.

When I started in July of 2014 I was a part time employee making 11.77 an hour. In July of 2015 I applied and became a salary employee making 25,000 a year. I didn't receive any raises until my transition to full time. At both interviews I understand I could have possibly negotiated my pay, but at the time I was just happy to have a job after being unemployed for so long. When I initially applied in 2014 I didn't have any experience either.

One thing I never encountered before was that the QC/QA half is paid based on a contract through another state agency. The operations portion is paid via the college. It's my understanding that the college pays about 10-20% of my salary and the state contract covers the rest. The workload has increased significantly over the last year, hell even in the last 6 months. With the QA database being busier than its ever been and the operations portion consisting of well over than 10-20% of the work I do on a day to day basis. (It was far less busy and taxing in both systems this time last year, easily by 1/3). With the ever changing nature of my job I feel under compensated. 

I've been reading articles about how people ask for raises. Normally they track how much money they have saved the company or detail what contracts/ clients they brought to the table. Those things are all tangible pieces of data that can be factored into the worth of the employee. That system isn't really applicable for my office since we are not a money making company. 

I have personally contributed really great changes to my department by getting the ball rolling and providing detailed information on various systems that improve reliability, fail safes, security, and tracking systems. All of my recommendations have been applied to the office, but I'm not getting any credit for the contributions. Instead my bosses come in and let everyone know of the great idea they had then implement it poorly because they don't fully understand the material from the get go. A lot of going around your elbow to get to your ass type of stuff. 

Now I do enjoy my job, and I enjoy the people that I work with. This is probably one of the best jobs that I've ever had. I've only ever been late one time from over sleeping an alarm, I show up 10-15 minutes early every day. Every day off I've requested has been more than 2 weeks in advance. However some of the things that are dragging me down are:

- I don't have a set schedule my hours change time and days almost every week. 
- We are a 24/7 365 office and there is no shift differential.
- No lunch break.
- Not all days off are consecutive.
- The pay period split happens on Fri/Sat so sometimes i'll work 7-9 days in a row without over time.
- I don't feel like I'm being valued for all I do unless I show signs of dissatisfaction. Which is met with a ""Great job OrdinaryBoar, we appreciate it."" pat on the back.
- I feel like I'm doing two jobs for the price of 3/4th of one.
- We are understaffed and there are not enough people applying or qualified to fill the positions.
- I get health insurance and benefits like that. But I pay more for the insurance though my job full time than what I did for obamacare as a wage employee.
- If the state agency ever decided to end the contract through the college I get no severance pay or guarantee of a job.
- I'm 31 dollars over the absolute minimum they can pay me in my pay band/pay grade. The band stretches from 24,969 to about 58,969.

I don't want to leave this job but I feel furious about the pay. I live in a college town so while the cost of regular things is pretty normal the price of rent is highway robbery. I feel for my other co workers because I know that they are in the same situation but in their own words they ""Just feel beat down by the whole thing"". I've only ever heard of any raises happening when the state raises the pay scales a few dollars every year all around. 

With all that said I'm curious on how I should approach the subject of a raise. My employer seems oblivious to what is a fair salary. Since there are no real examples of my job I can pull data from I'm purely looking at just QA or Operator jobs which seem to averaged around 36k for my area through state employment.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the help everyone. A lot of the information you have provided has given me better insight on the playing field. I'm feeling far better equipped to tackle the situation.",finance,1450052565

personalfinance,"Living well / saving money on $45,000 a year. (pre-tax).","Hi fellow finance conscious redditors,

Recently there was a post on the front page of reddit about how $45,000 a year was difficult to live on in certain areas of the country. Primarily in large expensive cities. While the premise is not inaccurate (depending on some context and individual variance) I noticed the comments proclaiming that $45,000 a year in general was not much money.

But I want to dismiss this narrative. I think it is false and I want to put it into some quick numbers to demonstrate this. Keep in mind the following examples are from my own perspective, and may miss some elements. If you feel that something important or obvious was not mentioned, please let me know. 

First off, we're assuming an annual before-tax income of $45,000. In the USA, on average, this would translate to roughly $36,000 in after-tax income. 

* Rent: $1,000 (Using data from http://www.myapartmentmap.com/rental_data/ for an average one bedroom apartment)
* Food: $300 
* Utilities: $250 (electricity and internet) 
* Car: $250 (bought used - only paying gas, maintenance and insurance)
* Health Premiums: $235
* Clothes: $50
* Cell Phone: $50
* Miscellaneous: $40 (toiletries, spur of the moment expenses). 

Total: $2,175 per month to live quite well in the averaged out prices of the USA. 

Per Year: $26,100

This means at the income of $36,000 a year, your total annual savings will be essentially $10,000. 

Now, this assumes a few crucial things. The first, you don't have student loan debt. If you do, that savings rate could easily drop by $2,500 a year. Still, that would leave you with $7,500 saved per year. Not terrible. 

The second, this assumes absolutely no drugs. No cigarettes. No alcohol. These are very significant expenses. In fact, combined, they can dwarf student loan payments. 

Third, this assumes you aren't eating out every other day. At $300 a month for food, you can eat out once, maybe twice per month. 

Fourth, you aren't going to be the best dressed person in the room. $50 a month isn't much for clothing, but it is more than livable. 

And fifth, you have to drive a used car. It doesn't have to be very old, just used. If you buy new, the monthly car price category could easily double. 

Now you can increase your savings rate by making further cuts. For me personally, I can get by on $250 a month on food. I also don't drive. I walk / bike / take the bus. That's $300 less already. 

I also don't run the heat / AC much and take short showers. Electricity could easily be $50 cheaper for me. 

Just taking those numbers, that would save me an extra $4,200 a year. 

That would be $14,200 saved per year. 

This amounts to $165,727 saved after ten years, at a modest 3% interest. 

If you start doing this at 20, or 25, you could have nearly $200,000 by the time you're 35. 
By the time you're 45, you'll have $389,352. 
55, $691,101
65, retirement age, $1,100,000. + Social security. 

At $5,000 less than the median income in the USA, you can be $100,000 over a millionaire by the time you retire, at an extremely modest 3% interest rate. Bump that to 5% and you're at $1.8 million. 

To be fair, this does assume your income increases with inflation, but that isn't too hard. It also assumes that you don't have kids (again this is largely speaking from my perspective so it won't fit everyone perfectly).

With kids, that could drop significantly, though even then, you're still looking at a very healthy retirement. 

Also, the above calculations were factoring in my increased rate of saving of $14,200 per year. At $10,000, by 65 (starting to save at 25) you'd have $773,336 saved at 3% interest. At 5%, you'd have $1.27 million. 

All I wanted to do here was show that it is possible to live very well and still save for retirement, even at less than the median income in the USA. It just requires a bit of planning and willpower.",finance,1450055314

personalfinance,SO has 70k in student loan debt and no degree. Need advice.,"My girlfriend recently disclosed how much student loan debt she has - $70,000 in private loans at an 8% interest rate.

I'm an idiot as far are this goes... so i'm looking to get some help. 

My car blew up.. well... not yet, but it's on its last legs.. im expecting the headgasket to give any day. 

i got a car lined up for 8k. i went to the bank looking for a loan for 10k and they talked me into trying to get a line of credit for 15k. 

went through the process, she said it was pre-approved.. all i needed to do was submit the proof of income and the cash would be aval on my account the day after... so i rushed through it all to get it done so i could get this car before today.. since today was the last day he would hold it for me. 

submitted all the paperwork and the girl (different girl) told me it wasent enough and i would need more since the 25k of income i gave her was a far cry from the apparent 60 i told the girl the first time.. so i wasnt approved. I spoke to another banker over the phone and he said with the amount im making i should qualify for a loan... then apparently Equifax fucked something up on their end anddddd now the bank cant do anything. 

so, yesterday morning first thing i submitted all my ID's to Equifax to get my birthday and address fixed.. they said it should be taken care of in a day or so. 

now im in a pickle. my bank doesnt seem to want to help me out so i need an alternative, which is why im coming to you guys. 

────────

Presidents Choice had originally pre-appoved me for a line of credit for 15k at 7.45%. (in my mind, seemed like a good deal). Now they're saying they can't do anything for me unless i got a co-signer. my girlfriend makes very little and owes the gov a ton for student loans... my parents are out of the question too. 

Where should i go/apply for a loan that wont give me a bunch of hassle/waste my time. 

I can prove i make 25k a year through my paystubs at my seasonal job. I've only been working for that job for 14 months so i cant show anyone any kind of tax form from previous years since they only equate to maybe 7k. I also have been recieving EI for the last few months but i don't know how to show that to a bank as income. My girlfriend gets her pay deposited into my bank account as well, and i tried to show PCF all of this via bank statements but wouldent accept any of it... just the paystubs from my seasonal job. I've also been doing deliverys lately as something to do until the snow starts falling but that's under the table so other then an excel document showing all my earnings from that, i cant (and dont really want to) show them that. 

so, in essence..

trying to get 10k via a line of credit or loan over no more then 2 years where i can pay it off in lump sums without getting charged. 

i can prove i make 25k a year through my seasonal job

my credit is apparently awesome according to PCF

My gf makes roughly 10k a year that gets deposited into my chequing account, 

i do deliverys on the side, but it's all under the table. that's roughly 2k a month when im off-season

i get 888 bi-weekly from EI during off-season. 

with the above, is there any way i can get a loan without crazy interest rates?",finance,1450059245
personalfinance,Looking to attack my debt,"Hello PF,
    
Long time lurker. Long story short - at 26 I decided to attend to school to finish an accounting degree. Now at 28 - I graduate in about 2 weeks. I was originally a machinist for a family business that went down hill. I've worked as a waiter and day laborer to get myself through college, some loans were taken out.

Last August I moved back to my parents to save on rent - I was paying $750 a month and now pay $500 to still help my parents out and not feel like a freeloader while I returned to the nest and give me back that extra $250 and to finish off my last year. 

I have a job lined up in January to start full time from an internship where I was making 12$/hr to now 50k$ (plus two bonuses equaling about 5-8k) a year. I had two other offers, one located in NYC @ 55k and 1 that was an hour away for $46k at a trial position during tax season (no bennies or anything till I was put on full time.)

 I gladly took the job for 50k that was 20 minutes from my parents and I generally plan to live the same distance (30 minutes) from my new job. I plan on staying at my parents for the duration of tax season (April 15th) to really just save up and get ready to move out. I'd rather sooner than later, but I feel this is a smart idea as all accountants live in holes under their desks till the snow melt anyway. 


Since going to school I've wiped out ALL of my savings and the past few months i've been skating by okay with the occasional DIY car repair. I'd like to know the best way to handle my debt, plans to move out and purchase a new car:

DEBT
--
**Student Loans**

**32,150 @ 4.3%** - unsub/sub loans from the Fed Gov

**12,650 @ 10.75%** - Sallie Mae

**3,650   @ 8.80%** - Sallie Mae

--

--

**Credit Card Debt** - *Have 700 Credit rating - was at an abysmal 500 before going back to school. 

**$620** out of 750 @ 10% - Capital One (SECURED)

**$200** our of 300 @ 10% - Kohls 

--

At first glance I feel that entering the income driven repayment plan for my fed loans while consolidating with sofi and knocking out immediately the 19k in private seems like the proper game plan?

RENT
--

I make around 2900$ a month AFTER taxes (and health insurance cost coming out), being a little older it's a pain in ass to find a roommate anymore. Does $1000-1200 sound manageable for renting a 1BR? That's the rent for a decent place in the area where I live (all following the 30 minute commute criteria.) 

A lot of the place pay for all utils, how would I factor that into price? Or I should I really go hard into finding a roommate using roomster or craigslist?


CAR
--

My 2002 Wrangler has seen much better days, but living in the northeast has taken a large toll on the car. I've had it paid off for years and hoped it would last to this moment, but it probably only has one more winter till I have to decommission it just out of safety concerns, day by day it parts of it just make different noises.

 Most I could get for the car is probably $1000-2000 for the right owner. Anything from a subaru forester to a honda fit tickles my fancy. I am really leaning towards the fit, should I take advantage of a honda recent graduate program that is offering 0% financing and 5% down? Or go used?

 Looking for MPG and cargo room, I enjoy camping during the summer in NY State and the rest of the northeast. 

Other Job Things
--

Job will be paying for CPA with a 3k Bonus if I complete within a 18 month upon full time employment (which is the game plan), they offer 5% employer match with a safe harbor (basically I put in 1$ and they INSTANTLY match 5% of my salary) and then an additional and seperate 3% match is available. The bonuses are my flat rate over 40 hrs both given on May 31st Paycheck (the larger one from busy season) and the Dec. 31st Pay check.

combined monthly income after taxes is around $4,800, give or take $200 depending on OT worked. We've been pre-approved for a place at a 4.5% interest rate (including the insurance due to the 10% down payment so we can get tax benefits at the end of the year).

* 25 years old  
* $100,000 annual income  
* Self-employed   
* Unmarried  
* Just started saving for retirement within the last few months, so I only have a few thousand dollars so far    
* $12,000 saved for downpayment  
* Emergency fund at $10,000    
* No debt and no car (by choice)  
* Looking at houses between $200,000 and $300,000 

It feels like traditional wisdom says to save up that 20% downpayment. I don't have a great reason to go against that except eagerness to own a home (I'm aware of the added maintenance/time/etc. commitment) and a vague fear that interest rates and housing prices will continue to rise. But I'm also wondering if I should work on building up my retirement savings first. What's the best path?",finance,1450083233

personalfinance,Instead of CCs with higher interest rates shouldn't I pay off the more expensive one?,"I PF! LTR;FTP and all that. The common consensus is that I should pay off credit cards with the highest interest first. I was thinking about it and shouldn't I pay off the CC that's actually charging the most money in interest?

Here's a completely made up example with fictional numbers for the sake of demonstration. Say I have CCA that has a 10% interest rate (unrealistic I know, just go with it) and CCB that has a 20% interest rate. On CCA I have a $600 balance and on CCB a $500 balance. Let's assume I can't pay either off in one shot. CCA is accumulating $60 in interest and CCB is accumulating $100 in interest.

Wouldn't it be in my best interest to pay down CCB at least to $60 of interest first? If I'm way off base I'd appreciate a correction.

First off, Thank you all for the wealth of knowledge in this sub- by far the most educational sub that I subscribe to.  

I'm hoping to get some dialog going around the impending meeting with the Fed and specifically its impact on mortgage rates. The general consensus is that the decisions made by the Fed on 12/16/15 are going to cause a steady increase in mortgage rates.  

What I cannot seem to are find opinions on is how this will affect me. I am on the verge of locking in my rate on a 30 yr conventional mortgage, trying to get everything in order for COB today so I can lock in my rate tomorrow prior to the end of the meeting/announcement on Wednesday.  

Will the Fed announcement have an immediate impact on Mortgage rates? Or will things hold steady for a while and then change in the near future? Will I end up with a higher mortgage rate if I lock in on 12/17 as opposed to tomorrow?

personalfinance,SoFi's disclosed rates and underwriting guidelines,"I was really excited to see SoFi's advertise 1.91% on student loan's and went through the registration and application process immediately.   Sadly the ""best"" rate thy were able to over me was 3.825% on a variable 5 year loan.

I took a screen shot of the advertisement:

http://imgur.com/6GNb0Nf

The rate quote didn't pull credit score which I was surprised about but I know my credit is really high.  Since they didn't pull a credit score, I also went through and try numerous permutations of of the rate quote matrix to try and see what did land the 1.91% percent but never got below 3.825%.

After that I decided to email SoFi and see if they could answer what it takes to get that rate.


**So I wrote them:**

&gt; Hi SoFi,
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to learn how to obtain the 1.91% APR you've listed:
&gt;
&gt;Currently when I go through the Find My Rate page, I only see 3.825% as my lowest option.  For footnote #1, you don't spell out anything regarding the credit worthiness of the borrower:
&gt;
&gt;    1. Fixed rates from 3.50% APR (with AutoPay) to 7.49% APR (without AutoPay). Variable rates currently from 1.91% APR (with AutoPay) to 5.45% (without AutoPay). Interest rates on variable rate loans are capped at either 8.95% or 9.95% depending on term of loan. See APR examples and terms. Lowest variable rate of 1.91% APR assumes current 1 month LIBOR rate of 0.20% plus 1.71% margin. If approved for a loan, the fixed or variable interest rate offered will depend on your credit history and the term of the loan and will be within the ranges of rates listed above. For the SoFi variable rate loan, the 1-month LIBOR index will adjust monthly and the loan payment will be re-amortized and may change monthly. APRs for variable rate loans may increase after origination if the LIBOR index increases. The SoFi 0.25% AutoPay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;APR examples and terms also does not spell out the criteria needed to qualify for such a rate.  I ask because I feel like I'm an ideal candidate for such a low rate, my debt-to-income is less than 10%, I've been at my job for more than 10 years and my credit score is very high. 

**Their response**

&gt;Thank you for your email. The 1.90% rate is for our 5 year variable term. SoFi considers a variety of factors based on your personal circumstances at the time of application. When making a decision about your application &amp; resulting terms and conditions we consider, but are not limited to your:

&gt;-credit profile
&gt;-total gross income
&gt;-years of work experience
&gt;-debt burden capacity analysis

**My response:**
&gt; Hi *****,

&gt; - Credit profile isn't pulled when I go through your rate finder so I don't see how this is possibly a variable when quoting.
&gt; - Total gross income - How much?
&gt; - I have the maximum years work experience selected (10+)
&gt; - My debt burden analysis, or my debt-to-income as most financial institutions call it is less than 10%.
&gt; 
&gt; I want the 1.90% but I'm looking for specifics regarding what it takes to get it, so far it's very ambiguous - please advise.

**Their response**

&gt; In order for you to receive your preapproval rates, Sofi performs a soft credit check, which does not affect your credit but does give insight into your credit history. As far as the other factors that are taken into account when deciding your rate, we do not provide any more specifics as they are part of our underwriting criteria which we do not disclose. You have been offered your preapproved rates, which are subject to change during the review process which occurs once you submit the application.


Well, I was hoping for specifics but merely received a ""we don't disclose this information"".  I'm accustomed to the car loan and mortgage loan world where advertised rates have to be spelled out on exactly how that rate was derived, given A-Z determining factors.

I thought I'd reach out to the reddit community and ask if anyone here received the 1.91% and can actually talk a bit about what figures were on their application at the time?",finance,1450117562

personalfinance,Buying a house with less than 20% down. Is it just personal tolerance for risk?,"I recently caught up with a friend of mine from college and he told me he bought a house with 5% down payment. $215k house, fixer upper in a decent neighborhood. 

I was shocked because it has only been less than 2 years since we left school. I had about 70k in student loan debt when I left school which I have since gotten down to $50k now. He told me he has $130k in student loan debt. 

Am I right in thinking that he is insane for buying a house with that much student loan debt? I don't know what his spouse makes but I know she has student debt of her own as well. I am currently planning to buy a house in 2017 or 2018 depending on expected promotions and pay increases over that time for myself and my SO. Hearing how easy it was for him to get a house with 5% down makes me think I should try and do something similar while interest rates are still low because my SO and I are paying $1200 a month between us for rent and in two to three years we could knock off between $30k and $40k off a mortgage in that time.

Would like to get my house in order in a financial sense. This stuff stresses me out, which in turn makes it that much more difficult for me to tackle. My goal is to get to a steady state where my finances are low-maintenance and facilitate my lifestyle rather than acting as a blocker.

Context: 

* single, 29 yo American living in Holland

* ~5k savings

* ~5-6k between two 401k accounts

* ~5k monthly income

* dismal credit score

* like, really bad. low 500s. All sorts of stuff to clean up on my reports, but I don’t have the time or the patience to address them.

* 50k in student loans at ~6% average interest rate. This sucks.

* 7500 options at 23 cents in a company that’ll likely go IPO at $20-$30 in Q1 2017

* 1500 eu monthly rent

* credit card, but it’s a low limit and paid off every month (mostly used for work travel)

* really about it for contractual expenses - rest of my money goes towards … yeah I should figure that out

* little interest and obviously no acumen in managing my finances

Couple notes and questions:

* -while I understand budgeting in theory, it’s been historically tough for me in practice due to a variety of factors. This needs addressing.

* -I’m data driven in most other areas of my life - haven’t applied it to my finances as it can be such a stressor that I’d rather just not think about it (ha)

* -I’d really like to contract out the credit score stuff. I’ve looked at Lexington for this.. but the service seems flimsy. Do these companies provide a legit service?

* -This potential (looking very likely) payout when my company goes IPO is intriguing. I don’t have any idea what I would do with that other than throw it at my student loans. I’d consider buying a place in the right city, but I have no idea where I’ll be living from year to year, so it’d likely be leased out most of the time.

* -I’ll have 1 or more opportunities for raises and promotions ahead of the IPO -- do I push for more options, or should I focus on raising my salary baseline? 

* -I’ve only been expat for a couple months. I’m thinking tax attorney might be the way for me to go. Does anyone with similar experience have any broad guidelines that I should follow?",finance,1450123699
personalfinance,Help a high income idiot,"I've never been very good with money for a variety of reasons.  I have been in a high growth industry and I'm unusually good at something that is very challenging and very high profit.  Because of this, there have also been more lucrative options on the horizon and I have never budgeted as a result.  I'm likely at the zenith of my career earning potential and I now need to sort things out so I can actually step back from the incredibly high pressure world I'm in now.  I'm looking to start structuring my assets appropriately so that they provide more security and to prevent myself from idly spending.

Here's the basic figures.  My current income is 1m per-year.  Historically I made more like 150-350k depending on my year.  The job I have now is not sustainable.  My net worth is $2.2m or possibly larger depending on valuation of two properties that I own.

I owe $650k on a house worth $1m.  I owe $400k on an empty lot worth $1m.  I'm about to spend $800k to build on that lot.  I have a little over $1.2m in stocks that I manage myself.

Primarily, what I'm looking for opinions on, is whether to borrow the money for the house, or to liquidate stocks and just pay for it.  Also, do I sell my current home when I'm done, or rent it and ride the market up?  I suspect I would get around $4,500/mo for the current home.  I'm in an area which has a tremendous long-term growth curve.  It is highly desirable and has limited land area.  Historic returns are roughly 8% per-year averaged over decades.  Does being slightly cash flow positive while expecting good returns in equity make sense?  Should I hold debt to do that?  I'd be more leveraged.

My goal is to leave this job with some security to go back to an irregular income of around $200k per-year and set myself up for eventual retirement.  I'm nervous about having so much equity in something as illiquid as a house.  Especially in two in the same market.  I could sell the old one and still come out ahead paying in cash for the new one.

3. Is there anything in particular I should be looking out for in this situation, or is it fairly straight forward because I'm a single individual without dependents, without much to deduct, etc.?

I've made estimated quarterly Federal tax payments on the 2015 year income I was making as an independent contractor prior to the acquisition and on a large one-time payment that was made to me somewhat outside of any contract once the deal was final. My salary income at the new company has standard deductions.

Starting in early 2016 I will be eligible to begin receiving the first portion of a 4-year compensation package.

I've always filled my taxes using HR Block's online software. I think I'm in good standing with IRS. I may have messed up by not paying quarterly State estimated taxes (did not occur to me until recently.)

On the other hand, my current roommate works at a prominent data-heavy start up and I know their data scientists have advanced degrees from a pretty broad range of fields--psychology, linguistics, and economics, to name a few.

I recently became eligible for my company's 401k matching and immediately came here to find out what the best steps to take were. I read the 401k guide on the sidebar as well as many of the links to clarify things I did not know. Even after all that, I'm somewhat confused and have come to the conclusion that my fund options might not be very good. I was hoping that you guys could help me with my fund allocation and tell me if I'm making any mistakes. 


To note: I'm 25 making roughly 75k a year pre-tax.
After reading the sidebar I have come to the conclusion that I will have 20% in bonds, 56% in US stocks, and 24% in international stocks. However, when I was looking through the best possible funds for those three classifications, I couldn't find any total market funds, total stock market funds, etc in my options.


Here are my options:


Bond Funds:

Eaton Vance Income Fund of Boston (ERIBX)

Franklin US Government Securities (FUSRX)

Goldman Sachs Inflation Protected Securities (GSRPX)

Lord Abbett Income (LAURX)

Lord Abbett Total Return (LTRRX)


Equity Funds:

American Funds Mutual (RMFCX)

American Funds New World (RNWCX)

Franklin Small-Mid Cap Growth (FSMRX)

Goldman Sachs Small Cap Equity Insights (GDSRX)

Goldman Sachs US Equity Insights (GSURX)

JP Morgan Intrepid Value (JIVZX)

JP Morgan Small Cap Value (JSVZX)

MFS International Value (MINFX)

MFS Mass Investors Growth Stock (MIRGX)

MFS Research International (MRSRX)

Oppenheimer International Small Company (OSMNX)

Oppenheimer Main Street Small &amp; Mid-Cap (OPMNX)


Money Market Funds:

Federated Automated Cash Management (ACKXX)


Here is what I chose:

Bonds: LTRRX - 20% (This was my 20% allocated towards bonds. It was one of a couple intermediate bonds, but had the lowest Expense Ratio.


US Equity Funds: RMFCX - 25% ; JIVZX - 21% ; GDSRX - 10% (To me, it looked like there weren't any options for 1: US Total Stock Market Index Funds, 2: Mix of index funds that approximate the US total stock market, or 3: A good large-cap index fund. That left me at option 4: Lowest cost US mutual fund). Did I miss something when following these guidelines?


International Equity Funds: MINFX - 12% ; MRSRX - 12% (These were two of the few international funds, and seemed to have the lowest Expense Ratio's as well as a good mix of investments. I can't help but feel like I'm missing something important.)


The first thing I noticed was the lack of choices. It seems to me that I should have a lot more options to choose from. The second thing I noticed was the lack of Total stock market funds and high-cap funds which seemed like better options after reading the 401k post. 


Am I not understanding any key concepts? One thing I do know is that I don't know much, so I understand that these could be really dumb questions that have an easy answer.

personalfinance,Wages Withheld Until One Month Ago -- How To Calculate My Tax Return,"I've made roughly $12,000 this year, working as a cashier. Until recently, I've had around 23% of each paycheck withheld for federal and state taxes, despite making so little that I shouldn't have been taxed at all. I'm only 21, and I know VERY little about finances and taxation (I am trying to learn, however).

What could have changed that caused my paychecks to no longer be taxed, and why could they have been taxed in the first place? I haven't submitted a new W4 form to my employer, and I'm fairly certain I filled out the original W4 form correctly and shouldn't have had any taxes taken out in the first place. Will I receive the amount that was withheld in my tax return, or has it vanished? If so, is there a way to claim it or receive it?",finance,1450153974

personalfinance,Pension Buyout,"Hello. I hope this is in proper form for this subreddit. 

I have a small pension from a previous employer. I was contacted to tell me that I have a few options in terms of the way my payment(s) can be structured. 

March 2016 (age 38): Lump sum payout $54,949.71
March 2016 (age 38): Monthly annuity for life $244.44
March 2033 (age 55): Monthly annuity for life $847.70
March 2043 (age 65): Monthly annuity for life $1541.28

Given the four options, the lump sum payout appears to be best. I think rolling it over into my IRA to have it become qualified money makes the most sense. But I currently do not live in the US (expat for 5 years), so I ""assume"" if I took it as cash, it would be subject only to Federal tax. The other three options do not seem like a good move. 

If I assume an annual rate of return of 6%, the lump sum payment would reach $330K by the time I turned 65.  Conversely if I took the $1541 at 65, I would be 82 by the time I took home $330K.

Ive been playing so many odd games that people have shown me, like OFF and Undertale, that I have come to realize games can truly change how you think about the world. And I would love to see more of these types of things.

So I wanted to make this thread to see what games you have played that you believe have changed you, or maybe could open the eyes of others.

**Terror on Moonbase Alpha** - Chapter 44 Part 2
___
___

Voices.  Whispering, talking, yelling.  Each and every one of them distinct.

Kara found, almost immediately, that being inside Mary's head was... crowded.  There were voices crying out in terror, some calling for help, some wondering where they were.

""SHUT UP!"" a booming voice roared from all around her and the other voices fell silent, Kara could feel their presences skittering away to the recesses of her mind.

""Kara, about time you joined me.  I thought I was going to have to kill your friend there.  It's okay to be scared, if I had to face me right now, I'd be terrified too,"" Mary laughed.

A figured formed itself out of the shadows, it was Mary... but not.  Taller, thinner, stronger - this was Mary as she saw herself, the idealized form that she aspired to.  She glided around Kara with an unmistakable presence, it was all part of the dance, the setup.

""Beating the crap out of Jacob with Chelsea's Krav Maga? Yeah, you're a real badass, Mary.""

Mary's face lit up into a genuine smile.  ""Ah, so you finally figured it out, huh? Took you long enough.  Think of all that you could have accomplished had you known what I know.""

""And what do you know, Mary?  'Cause here's what I know: You've gone off the deep end.  Say what you will about Sofia and Chelsea, they didn't deserve to die.  Not like that.""

Mary rolled her eyes.  ""They're not dead, don't you see?  None of them are.  I've got them right here - everything they were, everything that matters, it's here.""

With a wave of her hand, a figure that looked like Sofia emerged but again, it wasn't quite Sofia.  It was a figure that served the image of Sofia that Mary wanted - she was short and naked and hunched, her small breasts sagging into points.  ""Where am I?  What happened?  What... what did you do to me?""

""Yeah, you've really done a great job preserving her.""

""Like I said, everything that matters,"" she scoffed.

Several more faces peeked out of the darkness, each one a caricature of a human face.  And Kara realized something, there were several that she didn't recognize.  Several faces that they had never met in their travels together.

Mary had arrived in the TAK armor, the three of them... but she had originally set out on her own to find the survivors.

""Where... where are the survivors, Mary?"" Kara asked, feeling a pool of dread growing inside of her.

A slow smile spread across Mary's lips, a sort of 'ah, yeah, you got me' twinkle in her eye. ""They're safer here, with me.""

Kara reached out then, into Mary's mind, searching for the memory:

A pocket of survivors, eight of them.  Carlos, their leader, had been the head cook - had killed power to the meat locker and hidden them there in the dark, a message written on the door in black grease pencil: ""Survivors inside, help if you can.""

Mary had found them - the door swinging wide, light falling on their terrified but hopeful faces.  They cheered and they thanked her but she'd wasted no time - her mind snapping out all at once, into theirs.  Controlling, copying.  But it was too much, she was stretched too thin.  They stopped listening to her - they were scared, they knew she was in their heads, they wouldn't do what she said.

It didn't matter, she had them.  They would survive inside her.

Snapping back, back to her three.  Chelsea would do it, would fix it.  And she did.

Blood, so much blood.  She had tried not to look.

""Stop that!"" Mary yelled, and Kara felt something grab her and yank her backward, tearing her free from the memory, slamming her into a wall.

""You killed them! You killed them all!"" Kara looked at her in disbelief.

""I've saved them! They're all here, with me. Plus, look! All that they knew, I know. It's who we are, Kara.  This is what we're for.  We preserve... and we can use!""

""Oh my god, you're psychotic.  You have so many minds trapped in here with you that you've gone and lost your own."" Kara was steeling herself, she knew now what would be coming.

""Kara, Kara!  You don't have to fight me, we're sisters after all -- yes, you were a late bloomer, but think of it.  Think of what we could do together.  You want to change the world?  We can do it in a weekend!  What to know who was responsible for all of this? It's easy, hell, it's just a matter of time now.  Just gotta find and copy the right people.""

She was staring at Kara but had stopped seeing her some time ago.  Mary was floating there, what looked like tears forming at the corners of her eyes.

""Please.  Please don't make me kill you,"" she pleaded.

Here are the ones I am familiar with:

Hearthstone: The period after the Warsong Commander nerf unleashed a swarm of aggro decks that plagued the meta, with the Secret Paladin being the most iconic. However, the recent expansion seems to bring more variety to the meta and things look fine and dandy now.

League of Legends: Unless you played specific champions that got nerfed to oblivion, patches are generally not gamebreaking for the major playerbase. OP items tend to be more impactful with League of BlackCleavers/Warmogs/WeedWick 4.20 but patches are frequent enough.

**My plan:**    
* Pay off $15000 @ 5% student loan now.  
* Let car loan run itself out in April 2016 (only $11 in interest between now and then if the calculator i used is correct).  
* Contribute another $5500 to my Roth IRA in January.  
* Continue to pay $200 minimums on my remaining 3% interest student loans while I save for a down payment on a house and a wedding.

They were doing direct deposits so I didn't really even look at the paystubs for the first few weeks, but just now glanced at one and it seems like I am having A LOT taken out, but it might just be because I am not used to the salary I am at now.

For a 2 week period of pay, I had approx $1000 taken out spread across Fed Income tax, Social Sec, Medicare and State Income tax. Salary is $94k+. I am married but the only person in the household that works

I have a copy of my W4 and it looks like I put down 4 allowances on it. Basically set up as no one can claim me as a dependent, married with one job, I have a spouse and head of household. Looking at it now though it looks like I shouldn't have claimed head of household? Since it says ""claim only if unmarried..."". Maybe that's my issue?",finance,1450197498

personalfinance,Married and wanting to open Roth IRA but not sure our MAGI limit,"How time flies, all of a sudden being an adult is .... a real headache. Being responsible all my life, I feel very fortunate to have this financial problem. 

So a little background. I am an engineer of 6 years and my wife is a dotor resident. We got married this past Feb 2015 and expecting a child this coming January 2016

Although my wife has a huge doctor debt (350k+) with crushing interest rate (7+%), we want to be more responsible especially with the child on the way. We would like to start personal Roth IRA (outside of my company's 401k). After doing some research I am still not sure if we are allowed to open Roth IRA without using the backdoor way.

1. We were married in Feb, so technically does this mean we are married for full tax of 2015?

2. How do we calculat 2015's modified adjusted gross income accurately? According to vanguard, 2015's filed jointly limit is $183,000–$193,000 and I did some rough calculation based on last year, we are likely in that range. On their website, it said this range is ""phase out"" range, what does phase out mean?

3. If there is no way around the income limit, does anyone know a good site that walks through the backdoor process step by step. 

Both of my wife and I have very little experience in this type of investment due to our debts. But with the baby on the way, we are really wanting to start setting up our nest egg. Any advice/help is greatly appreciated!

EDIT1: Thanks all! I guess I should've mention my wife is also in military. If she continues to serve and likely deployment, military will subsidize 30k a year of loan uptill some number that i can't remember.  And if she works for non-profit org, there is a 10 year loan forgiven program (however, it is like a gamble, because that law can change at any time).

Forex,Fed to increase the rates but do not expect dollar rally as the big day approaches.,"It is most likely that Federal Reserve will increase the interest rate this week. However, do not expect any sort of a rally. We've seen investors ditch their long dollar position in USDJPY (December) and short in EURUSD (November). Traders who were long USD are long already with more traders moving to the sideline as the big day nears. 

Feds are committed for the rate hike however, I think it will be accompanied by dovish statement about the economy and they will emphasize not to expect any more rate hikes for the most of 2016. Most traders will be focused on what Ms. Yellen has to say and if she will be hawkish or dovish. If she goes on a tangent and starts talking about another rate hike in the first quarter, for example, then we could see dollar rally post FOMC.

technology,So now a registered drone should have the FAA granted right to overflight of any private and most government property negating any trepassing charges.,"I hate the whole drone registration thing. (needless tax. Invasion of privacy. Doesnt stop terrorists or criminals. No real safety issues exist-no- those are false reports and exaggerations at a minimal numerical scale ...but I digress)

However one interesting consequence is, since the faa is claiming they and only they control the allocated airspace,  then any drone operstor flying under their new rules should be able to stand up in court and say they have the right to fly between faa designated safe low distance and 400ft over anyones property. 

Thats because if faa doesnt have control of that airspace then they dont have the authority to regulate it. But if they are regulating it and you are complying with their rules and that is accepted by the courts then no local laws can usurp that authority just like you cant claim a jetliner doesnt have the right to fly over your house and neither can your state or city. And since the faa is acting for the federal government then other branches of the federal government ca t make rules for their property either.

So that means if you get your little registration tatoo ...ehhh...number... then you should be able to fly a safe distance above your neighbors head and below 400ft with impunity and no local law can be made to restrict you because the faa and only the faa has the authority to control that space they say.

personalfinance,"Feeling overwhelmed with cost of going to university, cost of living, and parents' empty retirement account - is going into debt okay?","I'm an American, 18F, going to university in the UK to cut costs. Total cost of my Bachelor's degree (including housing) will be around ~$50k. I want to come back to the US to get a PhD (and hopefully get it funded/paid for).

I had a part-time job during my senior year of high school and saved up $5k. Put $1k of that into a Roth IRA. I'm now in the UK, Semester 1 is almost over, and I'm down to around $2k savings.  My parents paid for my tuition &amp; housing, so I'm just paying for living expenses as of now.  The terrible conversion rate from USD to BPD certainly doesn't help. A few weeks ago, I got a part-time job working as a retail Xmas temp, but the pay is shit. And I can only work 20 hours/week on my student visa.  I can make it easily if I'm just paying off cost of living, but I want to pay my parents back as soon as possible because I just hate being in debt.  But I have no idea how I can even make a dent into $50k if I'm making minimum wage working part-time AND paying for groceries, etc.

I'm reaching out to some contacts now to see if I can get a decent-paying internship this summer (maybe back near home) so I can work AND get job experience.  But I'm also stressed to pay my parents back as soon as possible because they basically used the rest of their minuscule retirement fund to send me to college.  I have used some federal loans (of the $50k, $20k is loans, $30k is parents) that have little-to-no interest, but I don't know who I should prioritize paying back first: my parents or the feds.  They're in their early 50s, and have no retirement (they had a great nest egg but lost everything in the housing crisis - dad was a self-employed structural engineer, now a math teacher).

I'm just feeling overwhelmed. Did I make the right decision putting $1k into a Roth IRA? What if I'm not successful post-graduation and I'm left with this mountain of debt? Did I make the right decision by letting my parents use their remaining retirement money to fund my education or should I have just gone to the bank and taken out a student loan that charged interest?

EDIT: I'm also their eldest child, and I can't bear to see them working until they die.  If I have the money, I'll give them as much as they need to retire happily.

Bitcoin,"Why don't we do federated green wallets, federated side chains or federated anything anymore?","Lightning tries to do trust-less instant payments, but realistically that still involves trusting the majority of miners. And because of that, could't that trust not also flow towards functionary (run by or vetted by miners)? If you can trust the majority of miners, then you should be able to trust the majority of miners.  (with the caveat that enough miners offer to be or vet for a functionary). 

Another option is to trust functionary because of their proof of stake. And for both goes that they should have an incentive to play nice because they are invested in Bitcoin. 

For **federated green wallets** you don't need to give functionary the ability collude and steal coins because you can create a multi-sig address which always needs your key(s) to create transactions (functionary still need to to vet transactions and can thereby prevent things like double spends). Et voila you have more secure zero-conf. (I think you can even do off chain transactions with such wallets if you want). 

And **federated side chains** are a nice way to scale bitcoin. Although a two-way peg is more secure, it doesn't scale as well because miners still need to validate all side-chains. If side chains are simply multi-sig addresses on the main chain they easily settle with other side chains (so you don't need two on-chain transactions every time you transact between side chains). 

Obviously you need to have some sort of service discovery within Bitcoin to find or verify trusted nodes. But that seems like a nice thing we can use for all kinds of bitcoin services. 

For me putting money into a wallet just seems to make more sense than locking my coins with a single node. If transactions really become $10 (like some core dev's say) then I don't want to risk losing that investment in that channel. So even for Lightning you might want to have some trust model for nodes. 

So has federation fallen from grace? Or is that something which is still being pursuit? Maybe because of all the noise it seems like its only about Lightning or block size increases.",cryptocurrency,1450216625

I'm recently married to my HS SweetHeart of 5 years. We've(she) recently decided we don't want to move out of our hometown so we can now begin looking into purchasing our first home. We're both in our early 20's and have had a pretty decent start in our respective careers (IT+Nurse). A breakdown of our situation:
 
**Income**
 
* Wife - $58k Gross.  $1,500 take home every 2 weeks.
 
* Myself $40k Gross. $1,100 take home every 2 weeks. (Promoted once w/ 40% pay increase. employer wants to get me back to school and certified in more systems we plan on implementing)
 
* Estimated take home ~$67.5k

**Emergency Fund** - $5k (after spending $7k on our Wedding/Honeymoon)

**Set Outflows ~$1.3k**
 
* Rent $745, 2br 2bth 10/10 location
 
* Corolla $300
 
* Student Loans - $155
 
* Auto Insurance - $65
 
* Internet - $60
 
* Cellular - $ 90
 
* Spottily - $ 14.99
 
* Hulu - $7.99
 
* Renters Insurance - $15.99


**Varying Outflows ~$855**

* Electricity/Gas - $65 winter, $155 Summer

* Barber/Salon - $50-$100

* Fuel - $100
 
* Eating Out/Bars - $100

* Mani/Pedi  - $75

* Home Products - $50

* Movies $50

* First Aids/Medicines - $25

* Tithing - $200

**Debts**

* 2011 Corolla - $4k

* Student Loans - $12k

* Credit Card $220

* Amazon Card $220

**About the Debt** 

The credit debts are going to be taken from our pre-budgeted Christmas fund and will be paid for when they show up on our next statements. The Corolla only has 45k miles and has been maintained extremely well, we plan on driving it into the ground. The loan is under her parents from before we were married so it doesn't count towards our DTI Ratio. We are going to pay off the remaining balance at which point they'll gift us the car. The Student Loans vary from 3.5%-5.5% and we plan on aggressively tackling it after we pay off the car. To my knowledge they won't affect our DTI Ratio. 

**Plan of Action**


I want to get our emergency fund back up a bit but I may put it on the back burner. $5k is fine for 3 months if one or both of us lose our jobs which isn't likely but still don't want to risk being caught with our pants down. 

Historically, we've been able to save pretty well and if we can tuck away $2k/month I think we can have a down payment by April. We'd still need about $5k more for closing costs, but I want to at least have the DP down before starting the Pre-Qual process and seeing what's out on the market. 

As for the home buying part. The homes we're looking at are in the 200k price range at most, but 170k would be more reasonable. Using [this mortgage calc](http://usmortgagecalculator.org/), I've plugged in both 170k and 200k homes with a 5% interest rate, prop tax of the areas and a high PMI rate to come out to mortgage payments of **$1,270** and **$1,500** respectively. Plugging these numbers in to our budget there still looks like there would be enough money available at the end of each month to put to savings/vacation/etc..

**EDIT for TLDR**: Taking home $5300, spending $2200. Looking at homes in the $170k - $200K price range with $1,200 - $1,500 mortgages over 30yrs.",finance,1450230546

personalfinance,Best places/strategies to refinance+consolidate 70K in student loans? What about crowdfunding like WeFinance?,"I have 35K in unsubsidized federal student loans and 35k in private student loans with Sallie Mae. I was planning on leaving the federal student loans alone (and consolidating them through the 1 time consolidation policy) but I'm wondering what strategies I can use to get the best possible rates for refinancing the Sallie Mae private loans.

I have a good job w/ 70k salary, ~720 FICO/credit score but 70k in debt. I'm thinking about splitting half of the Sallie Mae loans with a fixed rate and the other half with a variable rate and then pay off the variable loans faster than the other loans (to capitalize on still low interest rates that will start to go up). Does this strategy make sense? Is there a significant level of variance between companies like Earnest and SoFi that refinance student loans? How much shopping should I do to get the best rate (are they all about the same)? Has anyone used crowdfunding sites like WeFinance for this purpose (and was the rate better?)

Thanks!",finance,1450242968
personalfinance,"Please critique my budget, is my goal realistic?","edit: Fixed my table!

Hello /r/personalfinance, 

I am looking for input on my budget. I will start working soon, and my goal is to save up a $60,000 down payment for a $300,000 property.

Civilian pay, before taxes - $70,000

Military pay, before taxes - $8,000

Total pay, before taxes - $78,000

Tax, federal and state (CA) - $17,000

Take home, after taxes - **$61,000**

I will be contributing 8.2% of 70,000 for 401k matching ($5,760).

Monthly take home, after taxes and 401k - **$4,603**

Expenses:

Category|Minimum Cost ; Maximum Cost
:-:|:-:
Car|$190 ; $220
Food|$250 ; $400
Clothes|$80 ; $100
Supplies|$15 ; $25
Going Out|$200 ; $300

Total Expenses|$1,535 ; $2,045
**Total Savings**|**$3,068** ; **$2,558**
Time to save $60k|1.63 years ; 1.95 years

I want to buy a 2BR condo with a 20% down payment two years after I start working. According to these calculations, in the worst case scenario (I really went overboard with the spending in those categories), it would take right around 2 years.

personalfinance,"About to graduate residency: 400k in loans, 250k job lined up, currently on IBR program, and just signed up for Public Loan Service Forgiveness...","Hello everyone, to give a little bit of my background, I completed an MPH and MD, and have managed to rack up approximately 380k in federal loans at 6.8-7%interest, and approximately 20k in private loans at 2.8% interest.  I am currently on an IBR for my public loans (of course), and am in repayment for my private loans.    

I recently started interviewing for jobs last month, and got an offer at a place I really liked.  As with many in my field, my offer was for a guaranteed base of $250k per year for 2 years.  Of course, if I meet certain billing targets, I can earn more (RVU model), and in all likelihood, I probably will.  But let's say I only make the base salary for now.  

My question to you is this: as I have recently signed up for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness, should I only make the minimum payments required for the IBR and private loans?  Residency counts towards the PSLF, so I am at least 3 years invested, and need 7 more for loans to be wiped clean.  Should I completely pay off my private loans, despite the comparatively low interest rate? 

Finally my last question is if anyone has any advice for a new physician? This is the first time I will be making so much money, and quite frankly, it frightens me a little.  Unfortunately, medical school and residency don't really provide the time or opportunity with regards to investments, and there aren't too many resources I could find for post-residency financial advice.

personalfinance,[Planning] List of expenses/monthly payments you'd have to deal with post college graduation?,"I'm trying to compile a list of expenses and monthly payments I'd have to deal with so I can plan budgeting my money better after college. At the moment I'm a nursing major and I'll be trying to get a job immediately after college. 

Hopefully this list could be used to help other people to plan better for dealing with personal finance after college too.

So far this is what I have, anything to include?

Monthly:

* Rent for apartment
* Utilities
* Student Loans (fafsa, are there any other payments you have to make after college besides student loans?)
* Health Insurance (after I'm 26)
* Car payments
* Gym membership
* Renter's Insurance?
* Netflix in place of cable
* Internet
* taxes (Federal, state, social security, medicare, local)

Expenses:

* Monthly food expenses
* Car expenses (gas/repair/maintenance)
* Misc. items allowance for self (clothes, electronics, etc.)
* Misc. items allowance for others (birthdays, Christmas)
* % of money that goes to savings
* money that goes to 401k
* Possible investing money to other accounts? (Roth? CDs? idk yet, recommendations?)
* Random payments that may occur in my 20s (fees, fines, doctor/dentist check ups, etc.)


is there anything else I should include? Also any ideal financial advice for people after college?

So far the advice I have so far is:

* Live minimal/frugally
* Don't eat out too much or buy unnecessary food at markets
* Have a checking and savings account
* Learn full details about lease or any financial related information before moving into new place to live.
* Research landlord company selling apartment to see if they're trustworthy and reliable
* Find living area near job (preferably studio or have roomates)
* Put 10-20% of paycheck or however much you can into savings
* Avoid using too much electricity/water/heating/ac if possible
* Maintain car to avoid future costly repairs 
* Prioritize important payments/fees/other financial related things first, pay as soon as possible
* Spend a little more every once in a while (nice dinner outside, night out in the city with friends) but don't do it too much or find cheaper alternatives to things that would cost a lot of money
* Avoid loans or any other unnecessary monthly payments
* Avoid using credit card, use debit or pay in cash (if choosing monthly payment vs. paying full, opt to pay full in cash).

My main goal is to save up as much as I can in my 20s so i can be financially more secure in my 30s and so on. That and to save up money to travel cheap a lot in my 20s after college too.",finance,1450252331

btc,My analysis of the imminent fed interest rate announcement,"This has got nothing to do with bitcoin, but my intended audience is you guys... people who had the ability to see past the crap, forward thinking people. 

So in a few hours the fed will make their announcement on whether or not to raise the interest rates. My prediciton is they will raise it with big fanfare... 

1. even though they secretly know they cannot raise it and 

2. they will raise it to TRY and convince the market that everything is just rosy and wonderful in the economy.

The canary in the coal mine is the bond market (the whole market, not just junk bonds). The disparity between the bond market and the stock market is growing bigger by the day. This exact same shit happened just before the 2008 crash. Then, moving over to just the junk bonds (high yield/high risk for investors hungry for profit) are also defaulting on their obiligations at record rate. I'm sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see if they took note of this. 

Now, just about every country in the world has most of their debt denominated in USD. All countries in the world currently owes 263% of the entire worlds GDP (last time I checked, about 2 weeks ago).  GBP... what a dumbass measurement... because Gross Domestic Product is not the same as ""Income taxes raised to pay for that debt"". In the time I grew up economists all agreed: a country should not have more than 20% of their GBP in debt. Notice how that ""20%"" number correlates to the average tax rate of most countries? Funny how that just flew out the window. 

When the rates are raised later today two things will happen. 

1. All these countries will now have to pay that extra .25% on huge amounts of debt that they already struggle to pay. 
2. The USD Index will climb (because you know... a rate raise shows a strong economy, hence the higher index). They will have to use more of their own (now weaker) currency to pay of those debts. 

These countries are already struggling under the weight of their debt, and a rate raise will give them a double wammy. 

So, to give you an idea: Here is america's Top 10 exports for 2014:

    Machines, engines, pumps: US$219.8 billion (13.6% of total exports)
    Electronic equipment: $172.4 billion (10.6%)
    Oil: $155.6 billion (9.6%)
    Vehicles: $136 billion (8.4%)
    Aircraft, spacecraft: $125.2 billion (7.7%)
    Medical, technical equipment: $85 billion (5.2%)
    Gems, precious metals, coins: $64.1 billion (4%)
    Plastics: $63 billion (3.9%)
    Pharmaceuticals: $44 billion (2.7%)
    Organic chemicals: $42.3 billion (2.6%)


Who is going to buy this stuff from America when governments, hospitals, airlines and the general public the world over cannot afford these things anymore? What' worse is... those numbers above do not reflect profits, this is the gross export total as far I as know.  http://www.worldstopexports.com/united-states-top-10-exports/2001. (And for those with inquisitive minds, check out China's Top 10 http://www.worldstopexports.com/chinas-top-10-exports/1952) 

Then, the last part of my prediction:

Things will unravel very quickly after the raising of rates. I predict it will get so bad that the fed will turn interest rates negative within three months, or start a war with Russia, which BTW has shown zero ""Russian Agression"". 

(Sidenote: Putin has followed every international law, every rule. The Crimean people did things ""The American Democratic"" way, you know, that “Our way of living” America fights wars over, and voted themselves to be part of Russia. This was was a great move since Ukraine is finished/done/wasted with 50% inflation. When I grew up voting was considered democracy, funny how this too is now somehow taboo, and labelled ""aggression"". The West denounced the referendum, but critical thinkers will say: If the vote was faked, why aren't people in Crimea super upset and protesting. Seriously... google/youtube it! The same baseless shit they've been spewing out about bitcoin is the exact same baselss shit they spew out about Russia. http://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/french-lawmakers-visit-crimea-pose-with-a-shirt-t

""Over these two days we saw that there is no occupation, no armed men, people are free,” Mariani told reporters. “This is a peaceful region and people here live freely and happily."" 

Oh... you're happy? Screw you. You excercized your democratic right? Screw you. We're going to impose completely baseless sactions to an already very fragile worldwide economy!  Even Italy is saying this is BS. http://www.thelocal.it/20151210/italy-stalls-extension-of-sanctions-against-russia 

And guess what, the same plane that carries around the american president is now in trouble because of the BS sanctions  http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/fate-of-uss-iconic-boeing-747-jets-lies-in-hands-of-russias-airbridgecargo/articleshow/50178748.cms )

Either way, my prediction doesn't really matter because

1. If they raise rates - bitcoin might show a slight drop, and then a big increase in 3 months time
2. If they keep it the same, signalling that all isn't as rosy as the talking heads have been saying... bitcoin will rise. 
3. They might just short circuit the whole thing, get it over and done with and just DROP the rate by 25 basis points, get true ZIRP, shock the markets like never before, in which case a lot of people will wake up, buy bitcoin, and cause the price to rise.

Current finances: I have $4474 on an interest-free credit card, but the interest-free period expires this month. I have $2415 in a credit card with 12%. I have $7542 in student loans ranging from 6% to 6.8% debt. I have a house w/a mortgage, a Roth IRA, a variety of savings accounts, and an HSA.

The capital gains tax I will owe will effectively be canceled out by other tax credits/deductions because I bought a house this year, so no need to put money aside for that.

Here’s my plan: 
Pay off the $2415 credit card.
Pay the $4474 card off.
Put as much needed into my Roth IRA to max it out this year, $3470; invest that in ETFs.
Put as much needed into my HSA to max that out, $1360; invest that in ETFs.
Use the remaining $3902 to pay off student loans, starting with the highest interest rate loans.

personalfinance,State garnished my bank account for back taxes I don't owe,"First post on here. Please tell me if I'm breaking any rules, and thank you all for all the awesome help you give people every day!

So yesterday I received a notice from my bank saying that the North Carolina Department of Revenue had garnished my bank account for more than a few thousand dollars.  

I just got off the phone with the Department of Revenue, and they said it was for back taxes for 2010. The only problem is that I don't live in NC, and haven't since 2008. Their files correctly have me leaving the state then, but then they say I moved back in '10. I'll be sending them copies of my California returns to prove that I wasn't in NC for that year, and am reasonably confident that this will be resolved, though if any of you know of anything more I should do on that front, I'm more than happy to hear. I gave them my correct address and will be sending over returns for all years between 2010 and now as well in order to, hopefully, avoid this happening again.

Here are my real questions:

1) I am enrolled in a credit monitoring program (Experian's Protect My ID) and have no addresses on my credit report other than the ones where I have lived. Notably absent from my report is the random address in NC (in a different part of the state from where I actually lived until '08) that the state thought I lived at. I am concerned that the Department of Revenue's incorrect address for me is a sign of more worrying identity issues. Is there any reason to be concerned, and what steps can/should I take if so to protect myself?

2) The amount that they say I owe is ludicrously high. Like, 25% of my Federal AGI on near poverty-level income, and an order of magnitude more than my actual California tax burden. The guy I spoke to on the phone said that they got my information from my federal returns and filed a state return on my behalf when I failed to file, and that's where the amount due came from. Plus, presumably, five years worth of late fees. Is that 10X discrepancy reasonable?

3) My bank charged me $125 to process the garnishment. Even if I convince NC that I don't owe them anything, what are my odds of getting that fee back, and what can I do to help my chances?

Thank you all for your help!

EDIT: UPDATE! Just got off a long phone call with NC's tax office. It looks like they believed I was still in NC because my bank never updated the address on one of my accounts to my out-of-state address from my parents' in NC. Then a transcription error at the DMV when I had renewed my driver's license in college gave them the wrong mailing address for me (They got the street name and number correct, but relocated it from my college in CT to some random town in NC which happens to have the same street name/number combination). 

So once I send them in my old CA tax returns to prove I was not a resident in those years then my tax liability should be zero and they should release the garnish on my bank account. The discrepancy between a reasonable tax rate and what they were charging me was caused by them (unsurprisingly) filling out my return in the least advantageous way possible. I went through the whole thing with them and there is no income on there that shouldn't be. So nobody in random town in NC claiming their income under my SSN, just a series of unfortunate bureaucratic screw ups.

EDIT 2: The bank is refunding the processing fee!",finance,1450283118

personalfinance,Student loan consolidation confusion,"Hey guys,

So I'm not sure if I'm making a big deal out of a small situation that can be easily handled which is why I'm posting here. I have student loans both federal and private. I know with my private loans I have to contact the private loan provider myself and deal with them but for the federal loans an ill advised person I trust recommended I sign up for Advantage Student Loan consolidation. I was told that basically you pay a flat deposit, kick your feet up, and they will set you up with income based payments. Huge mistake. 

I signed up with them about 6 months ago and paid $600 for their services. I still have yet to pay a dime towards my federal loans (this may be because they told me since I made Nothing in 2014 I would be paying $0/month for all of 2015?) After a conversation with my accountant I found out that I can basically pay my federal student loans back for free by going on the website or giving them a call. I don't even care about the $600, I'm more concerned with getting this whole paying student loans thing on track. My credit is suffering from this so my question is whether or not I should keep going through Advantage Student Loan Consolidation since I already paid them or should I deal with it head on and contact studentloans.gov myself to get this show on the road? My fear going with the former is that they'll charge me too much and won't handle ALL my student debt (my accountant said these companies aren't thorough so you may not be paying EVERYTHING you owe) and my fear going with the latter is that I signed legal documents basically saying they are handling my loans from here on out on my behalf. Sorry if this post was a clusterfuck, I just want to start taking care of my student loans without any worry. I also am a little nervous about the documents they made me sign.

About a year later (2007), Amtrak flipped to Chase and BoA sent me some WorldPoints card I just stuffed in the back of my wallet as a backup to my new Chase Amtrak credit card. The BoA card eventually became a regular cash rewards card, whoop dee doo 1% cash back.  Still the backup.  Except now Chase lost the Amtrak card and converted mine to a Freedom card.  Whoop dee doo 1% cash back, but at least it's got some real bonuses there (and a *much* higher limit). Amtrak is back at BoA and they won't convert my cash rewards card to Amtrak--they say I have to apply for it.

These are my only two cards, score is in the 730s (high utilization since I buy inventory for my business on it, but I pay it in full every month and try to make extra payments in between to hold it down).  I know from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3r5ovk/got_a_credit_card_for_the_rewards_rewards_changed/?) that getting a product change to a Sapphire Preferred means I don't get the sign-up bonuses, plus that doesn't transfer to Amtrak anymore.  (United miles might be nice sometimes, but Delta and ~~US Airways~~ American *blech* are the 800-pound gorillas here.)  It wouldn't be what I want, but it might be okay to settle for.

Conventional wisdom I've always read said hold yourself to two credit cards, keep your oldest card open, and keep the utilization down.  Well, the oldest card (9 years vs. 8) is BoA, the higher limit (and better rewards) is Chase, and the rewards I want are at BoA on a separate card.

personalfinance,"Screw you, MySavingsDirect","So, like many others here, I fell for MySavingsDirect's 1.25% annual interest rate a few months ago thinking, ""oh, of course I want to open a high-yield savings account with the highest interest rate... they promise the highest yield, so I'll give them my business. Cool.""

Almost immediately after my first deposit, the rate fell to 1.10%, to which I said, ""Dammit - that's lame, but whatever... at least they still have the highest yield. OK, not a huge deal.""

Now, their rate has fallen to 1.00% just before the fed has promised to introduce rate hikes, and they no longer offer the highest yield. I feel like I've been duped, and while the difference is pretty much pocket change given my meager savings in that account, I'm really feeling salty about the change. 

So, we'll see if and when they raise their rates again, but I'm definitely now in the market for a new high-yield savings account. I'm don't think I'm going to close my account with MySavingsDirect since there's no minimum or fees (and that could reflect poorly on my credit report, I think?), but I'm really thinking about it.

EDIT: TL;DR MySavingsDirect has decreased its interest rate for high-yield savings for the second time in four months, and they no longer have the highest rate (which is why most people signed up in the first place).

personalfinance,When is co-signing for spouses college loan consolidation a good idea?,"Warning Wall of Text: 

TLDR: Would co-signing to get a 4% interest rate reduction overcome the negatives of co-signing for a college loan?

&amp;nbsp;

Good day PF, you guys are amazing and has helped me through some hard times.  My question today is on co-signing with my spouse to consolidated her college loans.  I understand that it is highly recommended to never co-sign on a private college loan because you become responsible for the debt if the primary debt holder passes on.  Many others say ""That is their debt, keep it in their name"".  But what I want to know, is there any time that it makes sense to co-sign.

&amp;nbsp;

Take my our situation.

&amp;nbsp;

 My college loans


Loan| Amount| Rate	|Min Payment
---|---|----|----
A| $8000| 2.875%| $110

&amp;nbsp;

Her Loans 



Loan| Amount| Rate	|Min Payment
---|---|----|----
B| $22000| 3.52%| $182
C| $6000| 2.32%| $70
D| $10000| 5.41%| $113
E| $18000| 6.80%| $250

&amp;nbsp;

We wanted to consolidate her $10k, $18k, and $22k loan together with SoFi (or other company) at the variable rate of around 2% BUT they say she needs a cosigner because she does not make enough money to do it on her own. She teaches in Higher Ed and has her doctoral degree if that matters.  We both have around 790 credit scores so that is not the problem.

&amp;nbsp;

Right now we are paying the minimums on all loans and decided to postpone fully funding our Roth's and are throwing an extra $900 a month on top of Loan E.  We then plan to roll all those payments on to Loan D, then Loan B and so forth until we are debt free. Don't worry, we are still paying in through my company's 401k (no matching) and her Teachers State retirement that is required.  We also have 3 months in an emergency fund, and pay off our credit cards every month.

&amp;nbsp;

Looking at just Loan E, without consolidation it will take us 17 months and cost us $903 in interest.  If it was consolidated to lets say 2.5% it will take 16 payments with an interest cost of $319.  I know it is not a lot of money saved in interest but that is for only one of the loans.

&amp;nbsp;

So with all this said, would it make sense for me as the spouse to co-sign the student loan consolidation paperwork? In your opinions, does the money saved outweigh the risks of being a co-signer?",finance,1450288188
personalfinance,What to expect from my Tax Return?,"So i started my first job after college in April of 2015. I have a salary of 66k/year. I am pretty sure i filled out my w-4 form wrong,which is causing more taxes to be withheld than id owe. As of now I am losing about 29% of each paycheck to federal/state/medicare/OASDI. At the end of this year I will have made roughly 49k gross salary. Of the 49k, I expect the total taken out will be around 14.3k which seems really high? I think I should be charged at an effective rate of 21% and not 29%, which would give me about a 3.9k(8% of my gross income) returned. I used this website efile.com that gave me completely different numbers, to my favor and im just not sure what to expect.

Now that we know rates will rise 1.25% total by end of 2016, that means one would expect the index to theoretically decrease in value by 6.7% in that same time frame (duration times interest rate increase).  Granted, this applies to the bonds still in the index from now till then, and there will be some turnover, maturities, and new bond purchases, so the real drop should be lower (right?).

I figured I need to send about $6000 off as estimated tax. I want to make sure I do it correctly.

* figure out how much you might owe based on any number of sketchy calculators
* Sign up for EFTPS
* make payment in EFTPS by January 15 for income earned between September 1 and December 31.
* Do your annual income taxes as you normally would but enter the payment you made to apply against the total amount owed.

Questions:

* Is my list of steps correct? Do the dates line up or do I fall into a special case?
* Is there a good calculator for calculating estimated payments?

I unfortunately bought a house right before the 2008 crash when I was only 20. All my life I had heard ""houses only gain value!"" then 6 months after I bought my house value dropped significantly. Our house builder went out of business abandoning our neighborhood of ~50 homes while still in phase 1. Several houses foreclosed in our neighborhood and my next-door neighbor scooped up his house (200sq ft smaller than mine) for $81k in 2013. Needless to say, our house value isn't anywhere near what we owe. We tried to wait it out but increasing bills and lowering of income has taken a hit. We'd love to sell our house and move somewhere closer into the city, but can't get a loan for the difference we would owe. On top of that, we're both web developers who rely on the internet for work and the best option we have is an uncapped 4G hotspot (at $7.50gb it adds up quickly) because of our area - so moving would save us $200 a month in internet costs.

gaming,Maybe creating simple science isn't that simple. (X-Post from /r/fo4),"&gt; It’s early 2009. My geiger counter clicks faintly, picking up the stray rads from a 20 kiloton C-23 with a leaky shell. It sits at the bottom of this crater of a town - in a puddle of unimaginable filth - ever accompanied by church fools wailing about the glow of atom. I survey the scene and take a step backward, the *Vault 101* logo on my security boots now hopelessly stained.
&gt; 
&gt; Far above me on a catwalk I see the sheriff, Simms. His brim-shadowed eyes meet mine to acknowledge the secret we’re keeping from the dozens of people who live here. He hasn’t taken his kid and ran for the hills, doesn’t seem like he’s going to. I can’t believe he’s trusting me with this. 
&gt;
&gt; I can’t believe I agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; Nine hours and a full moon later I find myself straddling 2 muddy boards at the center of the pool, twisting a hundred tiny screws from the steel casing. Grunting as quietly as possible I pry a four-foot, partially submerged panel from the side of the bomb and splash it into the puddle next to me. The stew at the base of the bomb surges into the interior cavity I’ve created and my breath catches for a moment. I wonder if it’s my imagination or if the geiger needle moved.
&gt; 
&gt; The closest thing I had to a role in the vault was Demolition. Janice Wilkins and I were put in Maintenance straight from the G.O.A.T. and any expansion blasting would have involved us. And come to think of it, I doubt there’s anyone in that vault who hasn’t read extensively on the destructive power of uranium and hydrogen. We all get to an age where we start to ask what made everything go to shit. Point is, I know bombs - from big to small. Disarming an active atom bomb, undetonated in its crater - that was something new. 
&gt; 
&gt; I illuminate my pipboy and flip through a copy of *Duck and Cover* until I get to the simple cartoon drawing of *Little Boy*, the first one of these things to go off. I’d seen this diagram before in the vault. It’s just a shaft, really. Uranium at one end, uranium at the other. Neither half is a critical mass but together, boom. If I remove the part that pushes them together, I remove the boom. It so happens that mechanism is a smaller bomb. 
&gt; 
&gt; Good. I take a swallow from my flask and shudder as it chases two bright red pills down. I know bombs.


Mentats gave you Explosives skill by the way. Or at least added a whole number to a variable somewhere that helped you over the requirement needed to disarm Megaton’s little problem. I remember that because I had already sold all my drugs, probably to pay for a 10mm pistol and I had to steal a pack of Mentats from a local to complete the quest. “It’s for their own good.” I thought. That was one of the first real quests you get in Fallout 3 and people still reference it online, because it’s memorable. This is especially true for those who opted not to disarm the bomb, but set it off and kill everyone in the town for the sake of a few hundred bottle caps. When you complete that quest the landscape of the game is rewritten in a very meaningful way and a big chunk of how you go forward, at least for a few hours, will have changed. 

In a way that isn’t trivial, the set of skills chosen by the player of older entries to the series are what defined their characters actions, karma, and ultimately their personalities for a given playthrough. The skill specialization of your Lone Wanderer was at least as important to the character as what equipment they were using or the dialogue options they chose. 

I think of a group of ghouls in spacesuits and rocketships at the REPCONN test site and how with a high science skill you can correct the flight trajectories of the two ships just before launch, avoiding a crash. Or the fact that a decent repair skill usually allowed you to bypass the “Go fetch a new quantum-flux-kebab” objective because your character knows how to repair the broken one instead. These skill checks were also present in dialogue. A character with a high intelligence or science skill would be able to converse more fluently with a scientist NPC, who would scorn and talk down to a character with similarly slow skills. 

We see this type of dialogue interaction in Fallout 4 but only when based on the Charisma stat. There are dozens of meaningful ways that high Charisma allows you to affect events but I can’t help but wonder why, when starting with such a multidimensional and beautiful system Bethesda would chose to include action or dialogue modifiers based on only one skill/stat. I submit that the value of the “Role Play” for previous titles may have come directly from this mechanic. Had they forgotten?

I was lamenting this to a group of friends recently and later that night finally (after 100+ hours) stumbled upon the USS Constitution and its associate quest. There are ghosts and whispers throughout this single quest that harken back to the days of skills. With high Intelligence, a character can bypass fetch objectives for components and simply repair the broken ones. Complete with game-pausing, pop-up dialogue boxes that explain in text what the character did to fix a component without spare parts, be it scavenge wires from unused components or stripping and cleaning a power coil before reinserting it. They remembered after all, but as far as I can tell the few skill checks throughout this quest are the only ones in the game. They were an almost mocking reminder of how things used to be. 	

Maybe the endorphins we got from quests like that in older entries were to be replaced in Fallout 4 with the settlement feature and they lost sight of the original goal. The workbench offers *true* scavenging and building, yes but it ultimately only serves to add micromanagement of settlers that can quickly become unmanageable when you’re not supplied with methods to organize them. There’s no real benefit from doing well in a settlement. There’s no story/lore payoff and no real mechanic payoff. This calls into question why I spent as much time as I did placing turrets and ceramic conduits. 

Skill checks are not just what’s missing here, though. There are actually less than a dozen checks each for Science and Repair skills in Fallout 3. (Notably more in New Vegas but I’m the only one counting). They weren’t exactly peppered throughout the two games. I believe it’s more that they were well placed at times when the player was alert and aware of the current objective and more importantly *invested* in how events were moving. Who sees the predicament with Harold the ghoul in Oasis and doesn’t want to get involved. It’s awesome. It also presents you with one of the more difficult moral choices in the game. Harold’s infection has brought plantlife back to the wasteland and it’s spreading fast. A decade or a century later, life could be back on track with his help. But he’s ancient and in pain and wants to die. There’s no convincing him otherwise, he doesn’t care about plants in the wasteland. He wants you to be the one to do it.
 
Helios One is another example from the last generation. A solar power plant, in the middle of power struggle between factions. Your only job when you show up? Get it working again, and decide where to route the power. Who to help. Sure I probably had to kill a few mole rats and a glowing one during that endeavour, but killing mole rats wasn’t the reason I was in the bowels of that machine and it was easy to remember that while I was down there. 

It was about seeing what’s left after the bombs, and rebuilding, and an incessant sense that I was fiddling with things beyond my comprehension from an oppressive, terrifying government that vanished into the ash centuries ago. These vaults, these dungeons I was picking and hacking my way into were not for me and I shouldn’t have been there but now there was nobody left to stop me. When I hold that up against the dungeons and vaults of Fallout 4, I can’t help but feel like i’m being spoonfed a more watery soup this time. Where is the Randall Dean Clark of this generation with his random beautiful terminal entries? Why wasn’t Jacq’s terminal story in University Point ended in any satisfying way?

This can’t be blamed entirely on Bethesda. When Obsidian made New Vegas they employed people like John Gonzalez who genuinely make the industry a better thing. It isn’t fair to say “Why can’t you write like them?” because I sure can’t. But that doesn’t mean the beauty of the mythos should take back seat. It shouldn’t be cheapened. 
In previous Fallouts power armor wasn’t just served to you on the third quest. It certainly wasn’t a basic right for all citizens that could be ignored if so chosen. It was something you earned. Acquiring it (not to mention learning how to use it) gave you a lasting, rewarding feeling because you had to use every resource available to you so far and a bunch of saves to find it at the bottom of some high tech old military facility that still has dangerously active security systems. 

If you haven’t found one of these mythical dungeons in Fallout 4 yet, don’t worry - the main storyline will likely take you there soon. You probably won’t find anything overly interesting in there, however.

I won’t talk about the good things Fallout 4 has to offer. I’ll talk about what I don’t like because in my opinion the bad stuff I’ve listed is the only bad stuff. Barring some glitches that I’m sure will be ironed out, this game is a masterpiece. I’m approaching 150 hours playtime, with 130 or so of that on a primary character. I’ve already paid for all DLC that’ll ever be released for the game and I feel like I’ve given whatever support I can for the title. In fact I probably haven’t been this invested in a game since Scholar of the First Sin launched. I’ve never written a game review either (reading back I’m starting to think I still haven’t). 

I wrote what I did however, because of emotional investment. I’ve loved every real Fallout title ever released and have given cumulative months of my life to the series, so please understand when I say that Bethesda is making a fortune on Fallout 4 because it deserves to. It’s like an incredibly entertaining movie that you probably won’t talk about 5 years down the road with your friends.

Fallout 3 and New Vegas, while each flawed in many ways had a luster that made it easy to look past the awkward animations, or the bug that made an entire town hostile and is forcing you to revert to a save file from 3 hours ago. It doesn’t matter because nobody forgets Megaton, and I’ll never forget Randal Dean Clark. 
It’s hard to fault Bethesda for not creating *exactly that* magic again just because it’s what I wanted to see. 

tl;dr:   

* Why would I repair this?

* I’m not going to repair this.

* I don’t take you seriously but I’ll repair your doohickey for 11 caps. 

* I would love nothing more than to repair this.",technology,1450297543

personalfinance,How does Fed rate hike affect my currently in progress home purchase?,"My wife and I are currently in the middle of purchasing a home.   The sellers have accepted our offer, we’re just straightening out some septic system issues before giving our bank (local credit union) the okay to proceed with processing our traditional 30 year home loan.

We have a 3.875 interest rate locked with the bank up to 1/26/2016 which we bought down to.   If we didn’t buy down, the rate would have been 4.125.  The way things are progressing with the septic, there is a good chance that we will not be able to close by 1/26 to get that rate and it will be up in the air again on what the rate will be based on the market after 1/26.

QUESTIONS:
1.)	Does the Fed raising rates mean the bank will tack on an extra 0.25% to the rate they offer us if we lose our locked in rate?

2.)	How closely linked is the Fed interest rate compared to mortgage rates?   If linked, how long does it take effect to raising mortgage rates?   Instantly?   Months?

3.)	How does an increase of 0.25% effect a $124,000 mortgage in terms of interest that we’ll be paying over 30 years (assuming that I make only normal scheduled payments)?

Also, I'm 21, just started building credit (never had bad credit, just never had credit), and making decent money at a stable job (30-39k). No bills other than the car + car insurance and a retirement fund.

See [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/ft86/comments/3wtqmk/dec_1420_weekly_qa_thread/cy1fyi7?context=10000) post for more details about what I'm looking at.

Some sites offer the option to finance parts with monthly charges with interest rates somewhere in the 10-30% APR range. This would take a one time payment of say 2300 dollars down to ~210 dollars per month. In my mind, this works out well since it allows me to get a high end or expensive part without having to worry about one massive lump payment during a budgeting period (mine is every two weeks). Instead, I can have the first budgeting period include the parts payment and the second budgeting period include the car payment. 

So my question is, if I had no trouble making these payments (which I don't, really), would this be wise decision to make? I know the other guy in the link I posted here said I can use PayPal as my lender, but he mentioned I should take this up with you guys to see if I could get more advice.

personalfinance,Car loan is about to be paid off. What should I do with the credit union checking account?,"Long story, but I don't want to be vague:

I bought a car 5 years ago. I put down a sizable down payment and the rest of the car has been paid with monthly automatic withdrawals from a local credit union that was doing great interest rates because it was the end of the year and car dealerships were trying to get rid of cars. I opened the account with that credit union specifically for this car loan. At the beginning of every month, my primary bank (which is not the one that issued the auto loan) would move $150 or so dollars from my primary checking account to the credit union checking account, but my car payment was only $140. I was letting the extra $10 accumulate every month, to about $600. I have never taken money from this account other than the automatic car payment withdrawal. So with the car being paid off, I will obviously stop the automatic transfer from my primary bank to the credit union that issued the loan. I have since moved away from the area of that credit union, so I was originally just going to transfer the $600 extra to my primary bank, but then I noticed the interest rate for the credit union checking account is 3.12% and the credit union savings account (which was created alongside the checking account for some reason) is 3.99%. This is far better than the rates at my primary bank, which makes me think I should move my real savings over to the credit union, but I live roughly 3000 miles away from the nearest branch, so I would hate to get into a situation where I need to stop in to prove my identity or something weird like that. The credit union does have a decent mobile app that would allow me to deposit checks directly to that, which is handy since I will never have direct deposit set up.

TLDR: Far away credit union has great interest rates. Should I ditch my bank that has local branches for this credit union I will never step foot into again?

personalfinance,"My Debt Avalanche: Part 1 ""Options""","Given the amount of posts in this sub I'm sure a direct post about balance transfers, clearing out student loan debt, or even the ""Chase Slate"" card specifically have already been touched on (whether as a thread or in a comment).


Rather than just ask a silly question I'd just prefer to document my current debt situation in a series of posts, updating folks as I go along.  So here's part 1 of **""My Debt Avalanche""**, entitled..

##Options##

---

**Backstory:** My wife has a bunch of student loans ($25k), with rates soaring up to 8% (I understand my pain is relative).  5 years out of school, and a combination of deferring payments, paying the minimums, and finding out about a loan taken out in her parents name (that we would be covering), we're finally at a point where we can tackle the remainder, which is about $18k.

I've heard about the debt avalanche.. the debt snowball... the ""dollar a week into savings!"" and all the various formulae that folks come up with.  Bottom line.. my strategy is closest to the ""Debt Avalanche"", and I'm looking to pair that with increased payments and balance transfers.

---

**Options:**

1. Invest

2. Increase payments

3. Pay debts off outright

4. Balance transfers

Really quick, amortization tables are your BEST friend.  [Following this link](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=8000&amp;years=5.000&amp;terms=60&amp;interestRate=7.500&amp;loanStartDate=16+Dec+2015&amp;show=true&amp;showRt=true&amp;monthlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyPaymentMonth=+Dec+&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Jan+2016&amp;ic_id=mtg_calc_amortization_btn) will show you the amortization table for one of our debts.  For more on Amortization [check out wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization).

---

**Investing:** 

 - I quickly determined investing was a poor idea, as after getting a high-level overview of our debts (in Mint.com) revealed our variable interest rates had fluctuated up beyond 4%, so putting money into an account earning 3-5% wasn't terribly smart (plus, as /r/personalfinance wiki notes, this money isn't realized!).  With this in mind we started increasing payments.

**Increasing Payments:** 

 - As our income grew, with jobs, promotions, raises, bonuses, etc.  our budget grew (granted this is at the time we got married, did the honeymoon, and also bought a house.. *sidenote, I guess we did invest after all*).  We doubled all payments.  This was excellent, it brought the life of the loan down to about 2 years from 10+.  But now I really want to kill of this debt!!

**Pay debts off outright:** 

 - After calculating out a conservative budget (considering unexpected expenses like car/house maintenance, changes in employment, and health/personal issues ^[incl. ^the ^minor ^possibility ^of ^having ^a ^baby!] ) we determined we couldn't afford to pay off the remaining $18k outright.

**Balance Transfers:** 

 - Here's where the story really begins.. 

---

##Balance Transfers##

For anyone who doesn't know how a balance transfer works, a bank sends you special checks, these are called ""Access Checks"", and they have very unique terms attached to them, including promotional rates and deals.  An Access Check works in the same way as a normal check, aside from those terms, you can write it out to yourself, or to pay off a different card balance or debt (as long as it's with a different bank).

The ""Chase Slate"" card caught my eye as it has a 0% transfer fee (while most cards are 2%-3%), with 0% APR for 15 months.  Enticing!  This means I can write off a check to Barclaycard (18% APR), transfer that balance to Chase Slate (0% APR) and spread those payments out for 15 months.  So I called up Chase to see if they do this for student loans.

**Spoiler Alert: They don't**

 - *Rather than giving you access checks, you contact a Chase rep and they perform the balance transfer for you directly, taking the account information from you over the phone or through a web form.*

DARN, what other options do I have?

Chase Freedom.. BarclayCard.. Discover.. some, if not all, of those cards will offer Balance Transfers *with* Access Checks, but with a transfer fee of 2%.  For this example let's say we went with a 2% fee card.  One of our biggest debts is a single $8k student loan with an interest rate at 8%, so I can transfer this over to the card, and pay out the total over 12-15 months (unfortunately, I'm not sure what the minimum payment would look like, but I'd assume it would be lower than $8k / 12 months, to ensure you are forced to pay out a lump sum).

###Let's break this down to determine how great of a deal it really is..###

 - As you can see, [making minimum payments](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=8000&amp;years=5.000&amp;terms=60&amp;interestRate=7.500&amp;loanStartDate=16+Dec+2015&amp;show=true&amp;showRt=true&amp;monthlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyPaymentMonth=+Dec+&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Jan+2016&amp;ic_id=mtg_calc_amortization_btn) means we'd pay $1618.22 in interest

 - Bumping [payments to $320/mo looks like this](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=8000&amp;years=5.000&amp;terms=60&amp;interestRate=7.500&amp;loanStartDate=16+Dec+2015&amp;show=true&amp;showRt=true&amp;monthlyAdditionalAmount=160&amp;yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyPaymentMonth=+Dec+&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Jan+2016&amp;ic_id=mtg_calc_amortization_btn), we'd pay $725.42 in interest

 - Finally bumping [payments up to $640 ($8k / ~12 months) looks like this](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=8000&amp;years=5.000&amp;terms=60&amp;interestRate=7.500&amp;loanStartDate=16+Dec+2015&amp;show=true&amp;showRt=true&amp;monthlyAdditionalAmount=480&amp;yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyPaymentMonth=+Dec+&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Jan+2016&amp;ic_id=mtg_calc_amortization_btn), we'd pay $355.73 in interest

---

##Decisions decisions..##

Chase wants $160 of my money to save me $355.. applying some fancy CPA skills I've determined I will net $195 overall (assuming I just stuff that $160 under a mattress).

###Is it worth it?###
Depends... do I value my safety net?

 - The penalty for missing a payment, or not paying off the card is a KILLER.. we're talking 20%+

 - I could make minimum payments on that, but I'd still be slammed with the total balance at the end of their promo

 - So over the next 12 months, do I anticipate an emergency?  I can't roll back to those nice, comfy, $160/mo payments


This is all for $195.. if the Chase Slate card offered a free balance transfer it would have saved me the full $355.. but alas, it would appear that such a deal does not exist.

Time to weigh my options.

---

*Join me next time, when I determine what I'm going to do and why.. I'm going to reach out to Chase Slate again to ensure I absolutely can't balance transfer my student loans in some shape or form.. but based on that amortization table, taking a single month to make this decision will cost me $50 in interest on this debt alone.. tick tock!*

personalfinance,"Considering buying a new home with poor credit, high income","This is my first time posting in /r/personalfinance but lurking has been a great help!

I've been considering buying a new home next year after righting my poor credit as much as possible, but an opportunity has come up for a nice home at a great price. Currently my FICO sits at 608, and has increased from a 580 about 6 months ago. I continue to pay down my two credit cards (both at around 70%) and I am paying off the last of a few old collections (totaling about $1,000) currently. In addition to this, I have a car loan but no student debt. My entire debt is about $30,000.

I received a promotion 3 months ago and currently make $40,000/year salary which is allowing me to pay off my debts very quickly. Beginning in January, I will begin laying much more heavily and plan to be debt-free (save for the car loan) in February or March.

With high income ($40K/year) but a low FICO score (608), I am really trying to contain my excitement for home ownership until next year, planning on improving my standing in these two respects. However, a home I am very interested in is on the market now for $53,000 which seems very affordable to me even at a terrible interest rate. Other homes in this area are $80,000+ to be comparable. I am considering going out next week to look for pre-approval but don't want to damage my credit report further by jumping the gun.

How attainable is this home with my figures in mind? I really have no experience with such a thing. If I am able to hold it off for a few months (hoping it doesn't sell), I could build up a substantial down payment fund. I have about $2,000/month remaining after expenses.

Bitcoin,"On Moderation, Bitcoin, and Creating Content","Ok, I don't care that much about moderation. To begin with, the moderators get to have the kind of community they want. That's how that works. If they don't want your content, you should take it elsewhere. That said, this community should probably start having a discussion about what they want, and how they want it to look. So, I thought I would give a little bit of advice to the mods, should they choose to accept it, and all of you out in Bitcoinlandia can take it for what it's worth because... well... this is a community of whiney little babies, and I can't imagine how hard it must be to not listen to the constant complaining. I, myself, am regularly moderated, which I usually face by sending a quick message off to a mod or two. Frankly, I don't care that much if I'm moderated, but I do find moderation ironic in a world filled with anarchists.

Now, I'm often called a bully and a troll. They are distinctions I'm fine with. The only thing I really care about is truth, and I hate when people show up here and try to convince the community of things that are untrue.

When I started in Bitcoin I was much younger and much more naive. I remember negotiating to purchase bitcoins with Paypal with people forever ago, or free Bitcoins that were given out of faucets. I remember Bitcoinica and the weird failure. I remember the first edition of Bitcoin Magazine. I remember when Pirate@40 was asking for money, and I watched as people gave it to him. The forums were abuzz with rumors that he was investing in dark markets, and that's how his returns were so incredible. I didn't know enough then. I remember sitting there watching it and thinking, ""how can you know that it's a ponzi"" as others accused him loudly of running an obvious scheme. I remember when Matthew N. Wright made a bet with the community of (I believe) 10,000 Bitcoins that it Pirate would pay, and when that time passed, Matthew withdrew his bet, and told everyone he was teaching them a lesson. He was drummed out of the community, gave up his equity in Bitcoin magazine and the other dozen projects he was a part of. I remember when bitinstant came about and saved us all so much time, as we had to go to our local drug store and pick up the weird blue phone. An Indian would pick up and you would feed him a random set of numbers. Then suddenly, a few hours/days/indeterminate amount of time later, money would show up at Mt. Gox. I remember TradeFortress, and the Bruce Wagner ordeal, and dozens and dozens and dozens of other weird scams or things that looked like scams. I remember when mining started and people began bilking investors out of mining contract profits. And I remember getting scammed myself numerous times. And always, scammers feed on one thing: your personal greed. I was taken for many many Bitcoin by TradeFortress when he offered a Bitcoin index fund. I thought I was being reasonable when I put my money into the slow-growth fund. The returns that were promised were far less than all the other scams, what could go wrong? In a world where people were promising to double your money every month, TF promised only that he would double it every year or so. Reasonable, right? When I went to withdraw my funds... they weren't there. I didn't know then what I know now.

I remember sitting in the audience at the first North American Bitcoin conference put on by Pumper Moe Levin. By that time, I'd become fairly sensitive to scammers in the space, though I'm still surprised by their brazenness. I even tweeted about one scam that was pitching shares in an oil drilling company https://twitter.com/junseth/status/427102576824582144. It was there that I saw Neo&amp;Bee stand in front of a packed room and explain their plan to bring freedom and wonder to the people of Greece. I remember feeling uneasy about the polish of the pitch. It looked great, but I didn't understand a goddamn thing they said. I didn't trust my gut. Months later, millions had been stolen, and the CEO was flaunting his newfound wealth on Facebook as he took pictures of himself in nice cars. All of us sat there and watched that happen. And since then, I have heard dozens of others who were in the audience tell me that they also were as uneasy as I was about the Neo&amp;Bee presentation. None of us said anything because we are blinded by our desire for this to work.

After Neo&amp;Bee, I promised myself I would never let something that sat uneasy rest without asking probative questions. I was called a troll for attacking bitcoin-trader.biz when r/bitcoin moderator u/SeansOutpost took their money as the main sponsor of Coins in the Kingdom. They were an obvious ponzi, and he let them show up to try to bilk the community. That's fine. I'm happy to let Sean profit, in spite of himself. It speaks poorly of his character and makes me know that he will put his own desire for popularity or success or whatever the fuck it is ahead of the wellbeing of those he is hosting. But in lieu of my promise, I camped myself at the Bitcoin-trader.biz table for the remainder of the weekend, and explained to everyone who spoke with the man and woman behind the table (themselves investors in the ponzi) why it was an obvious scam.

""We do arbitrage to make 1% per day,"" the man behind the table would say. They had a live feed of all the arbitrage that they said they were doing.

There is a simple investment mindtrick called the rule of 72. Basically, if someone is giving you a percentage return, you can figure out how long it will take to double your money. You divide 72 by the percentage, but make sure to keep the units the same. So at 1% per day, they are promising a doubling of your money every 72 days, or 5x per year. So a quick extrapolation would mean that if you put $10 in on day one, 365 days later, you would be able to pull out $320 and 730 days later (2 years) you'd have earned a cool $10k. Three years in, if you invested $10, you'd have earned over $300k. Does that sound reasonable to you? ""So what you're telling me is that if I give you $10 today, in 3 years, you'll give me over $300,000?""

""No, that's not what I said,"" the guy manning the booth told me. ""I told you 1% per day.""

So I did the math for him, which he scoffed at, but which seemed convincing enough to the people thinking of investing. Those two threatened to sue me and they went back to Canada, where they emailed the head of the Bitcoin-trader.biz group. They pressed him for an audit after my so-called trolling, and then a week and a half later, he disappeared with their money and a few million dollars more. In the aftermath, I had a call with the man behind the booth. He said something like, ""I thought that the guy who was standing at our booth all weekend was trolling us, but when the fund closed, I realized he knew something we didn't.""

Here's the thing, probative questions are uncomfortable. I have been around these parts pretty long, and I'm incredibly familiar with the technology for a guy who doesn't know a lick about comp-sci. You have seen [my memes](http://imgur.com/t2sfuot) batted about, and you may have even used them yourself in spite of hating me.

Others like u/eragmus, u/btcdrak, and even u/americanpegasus are doing content and curation as well. You can hate our content, you can like our content, but the reality is that these communities are built by maybe 1% of us content creators. I enjoy the childish requests for no moderation, because behind the curtain, most of you will run like a child to any of the many moderators here and tell on people. The Open Bazaar team just did it to me, and I got warning from moderator u/Aussiehash whom I told to fuck off. What everyone really means when they say they don't like censorship, is that they don't like censorship of the content they want to consume. The instant they are offended, they want that content censored. Words like troll are used against people whose content you don't like, hijacking posts is the word used for the person creating the most content in a post. Recently, Andreas Antonopoulos (despite being on the front page lamenting the censorship) blocked me on Twitter because Tatianna Moroz told him I'm a sexist. Again, fine, but ironic considering the claim that one is against censorship carte blanche. Adam Levine censored me while trying to prove that he's completely against censorship.

Me, I don't care about censorship. Community's are built through some kind of pruning. The kind of community I like is one that self-polices and makes prunes itself much like Wikipedia. Those that don't want to be a part of it, don't have to be, and those that want to be a part of it choose themselves to participate. Censorers are always vilified. So I don't do it. I don't do it at all. So the great question is not whether you should censor, but who gets to decide who gets to censor. So here's my proposal. Everyone, stick around r/bitcoin. It's a great place, and u/theymos has done a pretty darn good job of not fucking shit up. Do I agree with his current moderation decisions? I wouldn't have done what he did. But I don't think this is a moral question. On the other end, I have r/bitcoinarchy. I have set it up, me and u/brighton36 will be the only moderators. And our only promise is that we won't moderate anything. And we have a history of being completely unrelenting in our unwillingness to censor. So now you can't say dick. You can hate me, you can love me, but if what you are ACTUALLY looking for is a uncensored forum, then join my subreddit. Somehow, I'm willing to bet that most of you are looking for a place that does the kind of censorship you like, and not no censorship.

Does that solve everybody's problem?

worldpolitics,How the 2 Party System in America is allowing Corporations to rule the world: An analysis of a recent article,"I read this article on the Washington Post and I became more and more upset.  The writers, and I think this is a general trend in American politics, are describing this trillion dollar spending bill as if it were a game between two teams.  They completely ignore the obvious influences guiding each section.  This is a good example of how NGO's can take advantage of a two party system. 

The particular post: (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/12/16/heres-what-made-it-into-congresss-big-tax-and-spending-bills/) by Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell.


So, I just couldn't help myself by analyzing the influencing industries behind each section. Each section of the bill was listed out in the above article, along with who the writers believed ""won"".  These ""winners"" have been stricken out.

OIL EXPORTS: Oil Industry wins ~~Republican win~~

US energy companies can now export oil, which gives these corporations significantly more influence with the global market.

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: Oil Industry wins ~~Democratic win~~. 

Extends (but doesn’t increase) alternative energy credits. The current credits clearly don’t allow for the necessary R&amp;D needed to compete with well-understood energy industries.

OBAMACARE: Medical and Insurance Industries win ~~Bipartisan win~~

This part delays taxes on medical industry and large corporations in general (since more employees = more proposed expenses). This also delays a tax that would hurt the insurance industry as a whole. Finally, this part of the bill maintains a block that helps insurance companies ease into Obamacare.

REFUGEES: Weapons Industry wins ~~Democratic win~~

This part makes it harder for refugees to enter the US. The democrats backed this initially, but ended all support under leadership direction (I felt the need to explain why this could be considered a democratic win).  In my opinion, this will only stall possible peace making agendas in the region.

VISA WAIVER PROGRAM: Weapons Industry wins ~~Bipartisan win~~

This part makes it harder for refugees to enter the US by helping the world pass around a list of possible terrorists, which cannot possibly be a good system.  In my opinion, this will only push moderates to radicalize. 

9/11 RESPONDERS: The remaining responders in poor health, the Medical and the Insurance Industries win ~~Democratic win~~

This part helps responders who have developed illnesses due to exposure during the response to the 9/11 attacks. I concede that this helps the people. This also helps the medical and insurance industries, who will be receiving that money.

ABORTION: Poor pregnant women around the world lose ~~Democratic win~~

This bill maintains, does not increase, the ability for Planned Parenthood to have access to federal funding and refuses states from banning funds to planned parenthood.  It partly defunds the United Nations Population Fund, who are accused of abortion propaganda, which may undermine worldwide efforts of balanced population growth.

PUERTO RICO: Lending Industry Wins ~~Republican win~~

This part doesn’t allow Peurto Rico to file for bankruptcy because it would hurt the creditors ability to collect money or seize assets.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT: Large Corporations and (possible) the Public ~~Bipartisan win~~

This part extends and expands tax credits for R&amp;D.  In my opinion, this will primarily help the larger corporations, who will likely not pass on the savings to their customers (like what we have seen with the pharmaceutical industry).  This may help the people, depending on the potential innovation.  But that innovation will take a long time and corporations have a thing about designing new products that are cheaper and more effective than what they can currently sell.

CHILD TAX CREDIT: Poor Families maintain the ability to eat (barely) ~~Democratic win~~.  
This part permanently (but what’s permanent in congress terms?) extends the Child Tax Credit of $1000 per qualifying child (what child qualifies?). This also includes a tax credit for families who earn less per year than what the Child Tax Credit gives them.  Democrats pushed for, but lost, an expansion of the tax credit to increase along with inflation. Or, in other words, every year with inflation, these qualifying families receive less money per qualifying child  Here was the article’s example: “a single mother with two children who earns $14,000 in 2015 could receive 15 percent of $11,000, or $1,650, as a refund.” 

EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT: Poor families maintain the ability to eat, but these families also stay poor by giving up the chance to purchase income producing assets ~~Bipartisan win~~

This part permanently extends the Earned Income Tax Credit program. The deal also reduces the marriage penalty in the program by increasing the phase-out level to $5,000 for married couples. This all relies on whether a child is considered to qualify (relation, age, shared residence) and the net income of the parent(s).  Net income is heavily relied on as a basis for qualification.  Qualifiers must not have investment income over $3,100
In 2013, Max without kids (only for people ages 25-64): $487 
Max with one kid: $3,250
Max with two kids: $5,372
Max with 3 or more (now made permanent): $6,044

TAX CREDITS FOR COLLEGE: Commercialized High Cost Education Industry Wins ~~Democratic win~~ 

This part provides $2000 of assistance for a 4-year program (tuition and qualified expenses). The average American college, with expenses, costs $18,943 a year.  If you are from a low income family and must take out a student loan for everything, you will owe now only owe $67,772 when you get your degree, instead of $75,772.  If your degree actually gets you a job making at least $80,000 dollars a year, 50% of that refundable tax credit is phased out. 

TAX CREDITS FOR TEACHERS: Teachers’ lives are slightly less difficult.  Congress feels better about our shitty education system. So, the Congress and Lobbying Industry wins ~~Bipartisan win~~

This bill allows elementary and secondary school teachers to deduct $250 in expenses. Qualified expenses. I keep hearing qualified through this article without the aspects needed to qualify. Regardless, the average starting US teacher in 2012 made around $36k. Several sources say teachers end up spending hundreds of dollars each year of their own money for their classrooms.  This is because most public schools have only enough budget to give some, usually not all, of their teachers around $250.  PTA organizations within the school’s region give more money, but clearly PTA’s in higher income districts give a LOT more.

CHARITABLE DONATIONS: All Businesses and Wealthy Old People win ~~Bipartisan win~~
  
This part extends the ability for people to give to charity.  If you’re at least 70 and you are giving from your IRA, you don’t get penalized! This part also expands tax breaks for businesses (small and large) and some modifications for tax-exempt organizations. The article doenst explain the extent of these modifications or whether they have positive or negative results.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE: Very Rich People and Large Corporations Win ~~Mixed bag~~

There are several concepts here. This part did not allow less oversight on the financing of political parties, an attempt to counter the growing influence of anonymous Super PACS. This part also prevents the IRS from stopping political activities in 501 (c)(4) non-profit groups (social welfare organizations, neighborhood associations, and civic associations), which allows these groups to spend and receive more money in the political arena with less disclosure.  This part also blocked the SEC from taking action on political financing by public corporations, which means corporations will continue to have little oversight on politically motivated donations.

CLEAN WATER: Farmers (and therefore Monsanto) and Large Land Owners  ~~Democratic win~~
  
Nothing happened here. The EPA is still blocked from enforcing cleaner water regulations, which had already been passed but was not enacted because of ongoing legal battles.  The democrats won because the republicans couldn’t outright stop it before it got to court, something the democrats already “won”.

CLIMATE CHANGE: No real winners except funding to inform the Public (but not on climate change) ~~Democratic win~~

This part only prevented republicans from stopping the already issued carbon emissions limits and from preventing funds going to poorer developing countries.  All that really was added was funding to help Americans understand and adapt to forces caused by global warming and ongoing pollution (oops sorry, can’t say that) sea level rise, severe storms, and ocean acidification. 

LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND: Real Estate Industry ~~Bipartisan win~~
 
3-year (instead of 25-year) extension allowing the public to buy land for conservations sake

FINANCIAL REGULATIONS: Wall Street Wins ~~Democratic win~~  

Republicans weren’t able to reduce wall street oversight.  A proposal to force retirement investment advisers to consider commissions and fees was not included.  But no additional oversight sounds like a win to me.

GUNS SECTION: Weapons Industry Wins ~~Republican win~~
 
Republicans blocked any research into gun violence and blocked adding people on the terrorist watch lists from buying guns.  Unlike the visas, I think the latter would have helped to prevent the radicalized from acting. Any radical action will lead to a stronger, more expensive, reaction.

IMMIGRATION SECTION: Immigrants won’t be unnecessarily hassled ~~Democratic win~~

Republicans weren’t able to affect an executive order on immigration enforcement.  Immigration enforcement is necessary to an extent, but can, like other parts of this bill, lead to radicalization. Nothing was added for this section, but technically this could be considered a win for the people.

CYBERSECURITY: The Media, the NSA, and the Cyber Security Industries win ~~Bipartisan win~~
 
This part describes the ability for law enforcement to use an overly-invasive technology with vague reasoning for almost anything.  This part also gives government agencies the ability to “encourage” private companies to hand over customer information.  This is CISPA snuck into a must-pass spending bill. The article depicts this as bipartisan by saying the House and Senate have both passed several versions in recent years, but it conveniently forgets to mention both houses are controlled by the Republican Party Donors.

FOOD LABELING: Large Meatpacking Industry and Walmart (and similar giant corporations) win ~~Republican win~~
  
This part repeals the obligation for meatpackers to identify the source of their product.  Could potentially lead to food poisoning related deaths due to imported food from countries that lack effective oversight. 

TRANSIT BENEFITS: Commuters and the Parking Industry win ~~Bipartisan win~~
 
The government will match up to $255 for public transit users who set aside money in advance for traveling and parking expenses. I doubt this is an option many people take advantage of, but I concede it will help commuters.

SLEDDING: Families who sled on Capitol Hill win~~ Bipartisan win~~

It’s a fucking sledding bill. I wonder how much leverage came with this bargaining chip. I think some of the families in congress wanted to continue sledding on capitol hill, despite security risks, and the congressmen used tax-payer money and time to write this shit into a national spending bill.

2014 “CROMNIBUS” RIDERS: Administration of Guantanamo Bay Prison (and US presence in Cuba) and the Pharmaceutical Industry (with its constant fight against weed) win

This part includes blocking the transfer of Quantanamo Bay prisoners and the ability for Washington DC to legalize pot. 

`````

After my signing bonus and relocation bonus, I'm looking at a taxable income of $40,000 for 2015. I'm currently putting in 10% towards my 401k, my employer matches 4.25% to my 6%.  My expenses are:

* $1100 on rent+utilities

* $260 car payment (I have a 18k loan at 0.9% interest rate)

* $100 gas

* $200 medical expenses

* about $400-500 on groceries, entertainment, and personal expenses.

I'm in my early 20's and have started to set up for long-term investments. I just opened a TD direct investing account (TFSA) and was planning to invest in the various E-series index funds. I plan to make automatic monthly contributions to my funds.

There has been a lot of talk about the weak dollar as well as the recent news about rising interest rates. I have not purchased any funds yet (just got access to TD webbroker account today).
How will these things factor into my investments? What does it mean for the dollar to be weak when buying index funds - whether they be bond or equity funds? How do interest rates affect these funds? Is this an opportunity to buy more or should I be more conservative?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Update:

This is my investment plan:

I will initially invest $2000 with 10% in bond indexes and 90% in equity indexes. I will invest in the following:

$200 (10%) into:

TDB909 TD Canadian Bond Index - e 

$600 (30%) into each of:

TDB900 TD Canadian Index - e

TDB902 TD US Index - e

personalfinance,Cash Accumulation Fund as part of employer Group Universal Life,"When I started at this position, the HR orientation basically made it sound like the Cash Accumulation Fund (CAF) was the greatest thing ever. I was told it was essentially a savings account that earns 4% per year that you could tap into whenever. As I was just simply trying to settle in after a half way across the country move, I picked the easiest options - 12x my Group Universal Life (GUL) premiums into the CAF. About six months later, I'm reevaluating my options after seeing a sizable amount of money in there and reading the terms. I've pasted excerpts below. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Interest**: Your cash accumulation fund earns interest. Prudential expects to credit your fund with a competitive interest rate. While the rate may vary, in no event will it be less than four percent.

**Loans**: After you have contributed to your fund for one year, you may borrow money from it as long as you continue contributions by payroll deduction. The loan must be for at least $500 and may not exceed the balance in your fund.  
For purposes of earning interest, any loan amounts will not be subtracted from your fund. You continue to maintain the growth potential of your fund while retaining easy and continued access to your money. Prudential will charge a handling fee for processing your loan.  
You will also pay an interest charge on your loan. Interest on the loan balance will be charged daily at a yearly rate of 1-1/2 percent greater than the rate of interest your fund is earning.

**Withdrawals**: You may withdraw all or part of your fund at any time by making a written request to Prudential. The withdrawal must be for at least $500 or the balance of the fund if less than $500 and may not include any loan and interest charges that you have not paid back.  
Interest amounts you earn on your fund are tax deferred until your withdrawal exceeds your total contributions. In other words, they are not taxable until they are withdrawn. Loans also are not taxable. There are additional tax implications not included in this Summary Plan Description. Please consult your own tax advisor.

**Paid-Up Insurance**: Your cash accumulation fund account may be used to purchase paid-up insurance at the following times: (1) When your GUL ends; (2) When your fund reaches its limit as defined by the Internal Revenue Service  
Your fund reaches its limit when the amount of paid-up life insurance that your fund would purchase exceeds the sum of your term life insurance and your fund amount  

&amp;nbsp;

It seems like their sell here is that I can earn 4% minimum interest on this money that I can either take out a loan against at 6.5%+ interest (that seems cheaper than most personal loans) while maintaining my interest earning balance, or withdraw completely like a savings? 

Am I understanding this correctly? Is there is reason I WOULDN'T put 12x GUL on this? Is there a better place to put my extra money?  It really does seem too good to be true but for the full terms it seems I have to contact Prudential directly and I'm too lazy for that (maybe that what they are hoping for?). I'm close to 30 now with a Roth IRA I started paying into last year and will hopefully hit my 5.5k for this tax period, if that is any matter.",finance,1450326666

I can spare about $200 a month however I can't pinch anything more out of that. As I said I work part time and am in school so I already keep my cost low. I've foreseen this day and have been setting some money aside for a new vehicle. I've saved about $3,500. I'm looking to be about $1,000 shy of what I'd need to get a vehicle that I like, that I can depend on for a few years. I'm looking into just getting a personal loan because my current insurance is about $100 per month. If I we're to get a car loan that requires full coverage insurance I'd be paying about $220 per month. This seems like a bit of a waste to pay an extra $120 per month, $1500 a year, for a car that is only worth $4,500. I understand that having an auto loan with my vehicle as collateral would get me a better interest rate than a personal loan but I doubt that the lower interest could beat saving $120 a month on a $1000 loan by avoiding full coverage insurance.

I'm a 36 year old queer woman. Most of my life I've been very poor. Like living in a tent poor. I've never owned a car. I didn't own a computer until 2010. I'm used to a very minimalist lifestyle, but over the ~5 years I've become more settled and now have enough income that I can actually start planning for the future.

But y'all, I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm scared to screw things up. I need some advice on what to do with a small inheritance that I just received. My main question is this: What's the best way for me to start planning for retirement at this point?

I live with my partner who owns her home. I just finished graduate school and have 30k in federal student loans. I have no other debts and 10k in savings/emergency fund. I have a tiny IRA from a job I had years ago with maybe 2k in it.

I got a job immediately after graduating this past summer and I'm making 39k/year. I don't qualify for the retirement savings plan at my job until I've been there a year. I work for a non-profit and plan to take advantage of the public service loan forgiveness program.

A family member just passed away and she left me an IRA with $20k. I'm really torn about what to do with this money. My working class/financial newb brain says ""JUST PUT IT IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT, THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW!"" but surely there are other/better options.

That's where you all come in. Should I be putting as many dollars as possible into IRAs? What about investing in real estate? My partner firmly believes in buying homes and renting them out as a way to have income during retirement. Is that a more savvy route? Should I throw this money at my fairly low interest rate student loans?

personalfinance,Got a bunch of gold sovereigns. Should I sell them and pay off the mortage?,"I'm a single person with his own large apartment, 25,000 euros in bank accounts, 24,000 euros in mortage left to pay (at 4.5% interest rate...), nobody to care for (both my parents work, have very good savings and no debts of any kind), my own car entirely paid for (since I'm in europe), a good but not high-paying job (20k€/year after taxes, plus some extras) and few expenses (210€/month for the mortage, then the usuals: 15 €/month for car insurance, 20 for internet and phone, 25 for heath and electricity, 100 € for food, 100 for going out with friends, 200 for the holidays fund, 100 for can and home maintenance etc...etc...). Basically, I save about 400€/month *after* spending on a number of extras I could cut, if needed.

One thing that I totally forgot, somehow intentionally, is that my grandma always gives me a gold sovereign for every birthday and some other special occasions (they bought a couple of boxes of them like in the 60s, and since the 90s they started giving them out to all nephews). I just put them in the bank caveau. My plan was to never touch them until I die. I've got almost 40 of them (let's assume 8,500 euros after selling taxes and commisions). I never planned on using them. I guess that my plan was something like: ""if more than extreme shit happens I can grab them and flee somewhere to start a new life"".

However I was wondering if I should sell all of them and close my mortage. This way I would be left with an higher disposable income and with still enough cash in the bank accounts (~10,000 €) to consider it a 9 months emergency fund.

What do you think? Is it silly to lose this safety net for such a small reduction in interests over the mortage? I mean... It's not like those 200 € a month for the mortage are killing me...",finance,1450357812

personalfinance,Is this a good financial plan?,"So, I just got a new job, going from 38.5k a year to about 80-84k (it's 70k plus travel bonuses so it depends when I travel.) My wife makes about 34k. I have not yet gotten my first check but will around 1/15 (I start the 4th). I am trying to pre-plan the parts of our finances I have control over.

Credit card debt: So of course like most people without a brain, I have allowed our credit cards to get out of control over the years. We have about 15k in debt across 4 cards with similar interest rates.

Student loans: I am graduating this month, and have ~60k. The current estimate is 411 a month on the extended plan or 715 on the standard 10 year. I am currently leaning towards the 10 year to save myself the shitton of interest over the life of the loan.

Living situation: We currently rent an apartment- gas and internet included. Rent + 20/mo for our cat + garage + internet is 1011. We very much want to buy a house and that's why I'm making this post.

My current plan, allocating our paychecks in the next year, is thus:
0) Immediately get my 401(k) up to maximum company match at the new place (already done at the current job)

1) Get a 3 month ""all expenses"" emergency fund saved up. During this saving period, pay only the minimum + a bit more to keep the balances from climbing (so basically minimum plus interest charges) on the cards

2) Once the emergency fund is saved up, switch to aggressive mode on the credit cards. Get them all entirely paid off. Switch to using one or two main ones, but only for expenses we can pay off within budget, such as gas, monthly, without carrying a balance month to month

3) Save up a down payment for a house. It was suggested that on our combined income we could/should do around 150-200k. Opinions welcome on this amount.

4) Once said house is purchased, save up even more emergency funds (3 months' expenses plus ""SHIT WE SUDDENLY NEED A NEW ROOF"" funds)

5) Pay off mortgage as early as possible

6) Invest as much as humanly possible while remaining financially stable and not doing anything too risky in said investing.

personalfinance,"Truck Repossessed, Next Step?","So let me start this thread by admitting that I'm an idiot for ever letting it get to this point.  

I had an issue where I missed a few payments on my truck loan.  Money was not the issue, rather just me being stupid and forgetting to pay.  I had an outstanding balance on my account of about $1500 (Payments were $373 a month).  

Last night I had a knock at the door, when I walked outside I see my pick up hooked up to a tow truck.  I ask the guy what is going on and he showed me a repossession notice on his iPad that said my lender had sent him.  I never received any notice from my lender that this was going to occur so obviously I was in shock.  I asked him if I could call the lender and straighten things out, he said yes but he was taking the truck anyway.  I got on the phone with my lender who told me the only way to get the truck back is to pay the remaining balance on the loan (about $21,000).  Unfortunately I don't have $21,000 laying around so that is not an option.  I pleaded to pay the balance that was overdue but they told me paying the full amount of the loan was the only way I could regain possession of the vehicle.  They informed me the best way to do this was to get the truck refinanced with another bank who would pay my lender and take over the loan.

I immediately called Wells Fargo who I've banked with for years to try to refinance.  They took all my info and informed me they'd be in touch with a decision today.  When I got the call he informed me they couldn't help as the rate I was approved for was 14% which was 10% higher than my original loan.  I explained the situation and informed  him I need to come up with the money in the next 10 days or my truck would be auctioned off.  At this point I'd be willing to pay the 14% and call it a stupid tax.  He said the underwriters would need to review and he'd get back in touch, but it didn't sound positive.  Since, I've gone on mylendingtree.com and applied to see if I could get any lower rates who would take over the loan, but won't hear back for a few days.

My question is, what else can I/should I be doing?  The only options I've been able to come up with are;
1. Ask a family member to front me $21,000 and make loan payments to them.  Not desirable, also may not be possible.
2. Ask same family member to co-sign a loan to get the interest rate down.  Also not desirable, but better than asking for the money straight up.

Does anyone have any other suggestions on how I should proceed?",finance,1450366063

personalfinance,Insurance trying to stiff me several grand,"On Thanksgiving I was in an auto accident that ended up totaling my vehicle. It was a 2006 Ford F-250 Amarillo Edition that had a bunch of engine work done to it as well as being in perfect condition (no rust, dents, scratches, etc.). I had paid $24,000 for it in September and the bank had no problem giving me a loan for the amount since the truck blue books stock for $22,300.

I figured I had nothing to worry about since I have full coverage on my truck and since my truck blue books for what I still owe on it. Well fast forward to yesterday and I get a call from my auto adjuster saying they finally got an estimate and that they will pay me 15k for my truck. My heart dropped and I asked why are you only paying me that amount, and he goes on about how their comparable trucks are selling for only 14-16k. So I argue with the agent for a good half hour about how my truck was in perfect condition and how it just had the motor bulletproofed before I bought it and how the owners manual is stamped for service from a dealer every 5,000 miles showing how well the truck was taken care of. Eventually he says he'll up the condition of my truck and see how much they can give me but he said it won't be much more.

So now I'm waiting for him to call me back, but in the mean time I did my own research. I have only found a hand full of similar trucks to mine and the 3 or 4 I found are selling for 19-23k, I looked up blue book and NADA and they both say in the 22k-24k range and thats not including anything that was done to the engine. I even asked the guy I bought the truck from what I should do, he said to not back down and make sure they make me whole since that's what I pay the premium payments for. He also said he just sold another 06 Amarillo like mine without the work mine had done for 23k. So my question is how do I get the insurance company to give me what my truck was worth instead of them trying to get away with giving me pennies for my truck?",finance,1450376262

MachineLearning,tanh or sigmoid for simple NN in MNIST,"hello, 

last day i've implemented simple neural network with Theano for MNIST dataset at my first time (on course homework).


Because i know that even very simple(1-layer) NN with only dozens of neurons performs very good on MNIST set, i've configured my networks as

  * activate function : sigmoid,

  * 28*28, [500,50], 10 2-layer hidden nodes network,

  * output function : softmax,

  * with L2 weight decay regularization.


However at the first time, my network converged with accuracy about 30%, which i cannot endure. 


i thought that my hyperparameter - (learning rate &amp; etc.) was seriously wrong; i'd used simple SGD with initial learning rate 0.01, and i'd halfed the learning rate whenever valid_error goes up.


i'd searched my parameter about 8 hours straight, till i'm exhausted( checking if there is any mistake in my code ), and i'd gave up and submitted my poor working NN.


Just after submitting, i've changed my activation function to tanh from sigmoid.


and it works as great as expected. The accuracy on testset gets vertically up to about 90% in few starting epochs, and it seems to converge as good. 


is there anyone have any idea about my result? i've always thought that sigmoid and tanh acts very very similar way and i'd just chosen the sigmoid because i prefer exponential function to log function..i have no idea why sigmoid worked poor on my result.",technology,1450388141

business,{Advice} Negotiating a partnership/independent consultant contract. (x-post from r/consulting),"I have a REALLy long story about how I became the kid off the streets to basically running a small international tax law firm in France.  **TL;DR is at the bottom.**

**Some background:**
I majored in Communication studies in uni and thought I would end up working some type of PR/Marketing job (which was ideal for me) until I decided to move to Paris and make my life that much more difficult.

I ended up getting a job at a small, but reputable tax law firm because they were looking for someone with little to know knowledge of US taxes to teach and replace their only US tax expert/CPA for when she inevitably got pregnant.

They eventually got impatient after about 5 months and hired someone else (I still am close with everyone that works there, and they concede it was a mistake on their part of 'giving me away').

I ended up going being pawned off to a man that rented 2 offices in their building for his own tax practice.  He is about 75 years old, we will call him Jerry.  He is well respected by most parties, and is the most experienced tax lawyer in Paris, but is notoriously difficult to get a hold of, especially by clients in urgent situations.

**Here is where the story really begins:**

We negotiated a starting wage of 14eur/hour - I would NOT be declared as his employee and he would not pay me under the table, as in France that is a big no-no and as a lawyer it could mean dire consequences for him.  So I leveled with him and said I can declare myself as 'auto-entrepreneur' basically meaning that I can call myself a consultant to his and employ myself - then I would bill him the hours I worked.

The reason he was not quick to call me an employee, is because in France when you hire someone on a contract, you are locked in.  There is virtually no way out of the contract, short of the employee quitting.
With an official contract, the employer is obligated to pay all social charges (full obligatory healthcare, optional additional healthcare plans, pension plans, etc.) which ends up being almost HALF of the employee's gross salary.  That means that if the employee earns gross 33k a year, 16k of that goes to the government, and 17k of that is the net earnings.  Somewhere in the past, Jerry got fucked over by an employee - he gave them everything they wanted and more, and that employee decided they didn't want to deliver on their end.  He paid a lot of money for a dud employee who eventually quit and he was stuck paying a percentage of the unemployement they claimed.

As auto entrepreneur, one is considered self employed and is taxed 25% of the gross amount of money earned for social charges and taxes combined, and is payed on a trimester basis.  There is no binding agreement, or an determined amount of employement between an AE and another business, unless written in a separate contract.  This was an ideal situation for my boss, as it was a very low risk opportunity, and I came dirt cheap.

Now that you have an idea of how I was employed, here is my experience working with him for the first 3 months:

Jerry took a 'forced' 2 months off work between July and September because his foot had become swollen for some reason still unknown to him and he became immobilized.  Just before he left, his secretary had quit to go to grad school.  During this time, he did not answer any phone calls, emails, faxes, and certainly did not get ANY work done.  He had lost track of the progress of his business - which client's taxes had been completed and filed, which client's tax info he had so he can start the work and eventually file them, and which clients did not send anything in.  He was flying blind.

The building was on fire, and for some reason, I wandered right into it.

It didn't help that all of his files were in old school filing cabinets, and when I mean files I mean loose papers of important tax documents stuffed carelessly into brown envelopes, with sometimes 3-4 duplicates of documents, including non-relevant emails, and sometimes other client's information.

Here is what I did:  

1. Combed through the filing cabinets about 30 times, while creating a master list on excel of all clients who have been completed, who's clients information we have, and who needs to be contacted so we can complete their return.
2.  Contacted all clients to let them know Jerry is alive, and that we need their tax info.
3.  Created an excel to organize who has paid their bill, who has not paid, and who has yet to be billed.  I went through these filing cabinets about 30 times in those 3 months.

Jerry was nowhere to be found for any of this work.  It was all me.

Working conditions were fucking awful - the internet and phone line was always getting cut because he couldn't pay the bill on time - it's not that he didn't have the money, he just didn't care.  The 12 year old computers would freeze and lose all the progress I made on a client's tax return. And much much more.

Just when we started to seem to be working in a groove where I would prepare the tax return, and he would pop in, pick up the work I did and go home and review it on his home computer, Jerry decided to leave not for 1, but 2 weeks to Cuba. For a fucking vacation.  With 1 month before the definitive deadline of all expat taxes being due.  I couldn't believe it.  Still, I continued doing the work.

In the end it all worked out.  I feel that I ended up saving this guy's ass.  I put him back on track where otherwise he would have been seriously in the shit - I'm talking lawsuits and bankruptcy, and leaving the industry as a bit of a laughing stock.  It was at that time when we were talking about where we are going with my role as his employee - he mentioned handing down the business to me as it seemed that I like the work and I'm capable of doing it, and we get along.

Then the bad news came - we found out that we will be forced to find a new office, almost immediately because of an issue with the lease and the renters we sublet our space from.

In a very short, chronological order, here is what happened next:

1. Packed the entire office myself
2. Moved everything into Jerry's apartment
3. Found an office for a decent price at a prestigious address
4. Unpacked the entire office myself and made it somewhat functional for him to meet with clients
5. Hired a friend to help me organize an entirely new way of filing clients (binders in an archive room)
6. Purged all documents of old clients (archived), and duplicated documents (about 25 moving boxes that we had to call a company to get them legally destroyed).
7. Purchased all new desks, computers, network, office supplies (using his money, but it was needed).
8. Saved money by hiring the right people to install office phone lines, network and internet.

My (very capable and useful) friend just kind of became the secretary and I began to resume my work around June as being a tax preparer.  Since then we have been running the business at most efficient level.  The bills are automaticaly deducted from Jerry's business account, so no more outages.   The files in binders are beautiful.  There are no duplicate documents.  Everything is findable within seconds.  The computers work on the network flawlessly. We have an excel spreadsheet for EVERYTHING and they work impeccably.

We tried to make the office an environment where Jerry would want to spend time.  Things are easily accessible and comfortable, but he still only comes in for meetings with clients.  He insists on bringing in a fucking suitcase to fill with client's binders to take home to work on them, when he has a brand new, top of the line desktop computer at his desk.  I get nervous because when those client files go into his suitcase, I have no idea when I will see them again, if ever.

I prepared over 1/2 of our client's tax returns and he took no interest in reviewing my work as we agreed upon until the last 2 weeks of December...Then he became irritated and stressed out, although my end of the work had already been done for weeks, if not months.

**Here is the kicker:**

The entire time I have been working for him, I am still under the 'auto entrepreneur' scheme where I am making 14eur/hour.  I am not paid if I am sick, or if there is a holiday.

I had a conversation with him last week about my future because I told him I cannot continue working this way.  He told me he wants me to take over his business one day, and is open to anything except for a contract, although that is what I prefer - it offers me stability.

Now that you guys know the entire history, here is my need for advice:

If I were to ask him for a partnership, it would be a somewhat 'unofficial' partnership as his business is registered as a law firm in France, and non lawyers are not legally allowed to own any part of the business.  
The gross amount of money he makes is around 300k, but on his French tax return, the net amount after all deductions (rent, travel, insurance meals and entertainment, etc.) is around 90k.  If I were to ask for 30% of his business, I would only be making 27k and I would STILL have to pay my own social charges/taxes etc.
If I were to take a partnership, how do I calculate what I should appropriately earn?  Should I ask for 30-50% of the gross amount?  
Additionally, about 1/4 of his clients are billed in US currency, and he is notoriously shady about keeping bills/records of clients paying in USD in the office (although I doubt he has any organized billing register for those USD bills.)

If I were to continue as an independent contractor, I would ask for a lot more money than what I am earning now, as I feel I have more than just leverage of my boss on this issue.  I feel that he is willing to give what I want to keep me happy, but I would like to know the different ways to approach this.

**TL;DR - I saved this guys business from going bankrupt/sued, orchestrated a very successful facelift of his business and how it is run, all while being paid 14/eur an hour.  He is never in the office except for meetings and I continue to do all the work - I have the opportunity to become a partner or independant consultant, because he does NOT want to give me an employee contract.  I've sacrificed enough of my own needs to prove I can own/run this business - how do I negotiate the best outcome for me?**

personalfinance,Should I refinance my car? I have a quote to compare... Is it worth it? Any help would be SUPER appreciated!,"Yada yada I'm financially uneducated please excuse my ignorance blah blah

25 year old male. My credit score is 629. I bring home about 1600 a month. Rent is only 250.

I think my credit score is less shitty than it was when I took out this loan. So I should consider refinancing right? Isn't that how it works?

I'm not simply trying to reduce my monthly payment. I can afford the payments. What I want is to pay less total to get the car paid off. Even if that meant slightly higher monthly payments... I just want to pay it off as soon as possible with the least amount of money. So wouldn't that mean I should focus solely on a reduced APR? 

I have been putting some money towards the principle here and there whenever I can afford to.

Details:

* Vehicle: 2009 Subaru Impreza
* had 67,000 miles. 
* Now it has about 80,000 miles. 
* I love my car, its exactly what I wanted. Runs great and everything.

Current Loan:

* Original Loan Amount: $11,896.86
* Interest Rate: 19.040% APR
* Loan Term:73 Month
* Monthly Payment: $280.59
* Open Date:Aug 30, 2014
* Maturity Date:Sep 14, 2020
* Today's Payoff Amount $9,876.40
* Interest Paid YTD: $1,988.93
* Interest Paid in 2014: $731.21
* Interest Paid: $2,720.14
* Total Principal Paid: $2,035.89

The quote I got from BlueHarbor: 

* Amount Requested: $10,623.65
* Monthly Payment: $248.57
* Term: 60 months
* Interest Rate: 14.25% APR
* GAP insurance included.


Now, while a simple 'YES DO IT NOW' or 'NO WAY IDIOT' would still be appreciated, I would love to get some of these questions answered as well so I can be less clueless about this stuff:

* Why is the amount requested on the quote **more** than today's payoff amount? They said there were no fees... I'm guessing that's just how it works? Or something?
* Should I get a quote through anyone else? How much shopping around should I do? I tried one other place called IFS auto loans; they declined me due to 'negative equity in the vehicle' (apparently its valued at $7,700)
* Aside from the amount requested being more than today's payoff amount, these numbers look pretty good to me. Are they good enough? Is there anything I'm not considering? What else should weigh in here? To my untrained eye it looks like a total improvement...

Guys and gals, I really appreciate any advice you have for me. If you don't have any advice, a point in the right direction would be cool too. I have tried several loan calculators I found with Google, none were particularly helpful...",finance,1450393964

personalfinance,Need Advice - Temporarily disabled and job placed me on an unpaid leave of absence,"I'm a hard working 25 year old female, first generation college graduate (just graduated this past June) and California native that works as a veterinary nurse. I sustained an injury to my shoulder and my doctor placed me on modified activity at work and home for 2 weeks. After giving my supervisor my doctor's note, my job informed me that they are unable to accomodate my modified activity restrictions and have made me take an unpaid leave of absence from work. This was completely unexpected as I feel like there are job duties I could do at work that do not require the use of my right shoulder.

The doctor's note states that: ""if modified activity is not accomodated by the employer then this patient is considered temporarily and totally disabled from their regular work for the designated time and a separate off work order is not required.""

Because I have only been an employee there for 5+ months and my disability is temporary, I learned that I am not eligible for federal disability nor for coverage under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Because I was not working while finishing my last year of school, I am also not eligible for CA state disability as they would be calculating/basing my benefits from income earned between July 2014-June 2015. I started working at this job on July 1st 2015.

The holidays are right around the corner and I am now in jeopardy of not being able to pay rent let alone gifts I was supposed to be buying. This injury and news of my unpaid leave has come at the worst possible time. I live alone, do not have much family support as everyone is in a low income household, and I start making my very first student loan payment this month, on top of my other bills. My next check (pay day Dec 25th) will be next to nothing since I am not working and that check is what I use to pay rent for the following month (Jan 1st).

What can I do? Is there anything I could apply for that I'm missing? Are apartment communities typically uncaring if I explain the situation to them and ask to turn my rent in late once I return to work and get a real check again? Or is there no hope and I just have to try to survive for the next few weeks with what I have? I appreciate any advice.

I should also clarify that the injury was not necessarily caused at work, though given the nature of my job, I handle and lift sometimes large dogs or strong dogs that aren't the most behaved and like to pull and yank on their leash. So it is extremely likely that its an overuse injury from work but since I did not immediately remember any particular incident that caused it and I first felt pain when I woke up on my first day off of the week, I did not file a worker's comp claim.",finance,1450396853
personalfinance,"Repaid $87,000 over the course of 4 years. Here are some strategies I used to get there.","Hello PF,

As of today, I have officially brought my undergraduate student loan debt [balance to ZERO]( http://imgur.com/Lka9D06). It took 4 years, 7 months, and 12 days to get to this point. I wanted to post here to help anyone who is going to be taking on a similarly large amount of debt or is currently facing a large number like I was. I hope it helps. 

**Tip #1 – Know what you’re getting into before you take on the debt.**
When I was selecting where to attend college, the financial side was always on my mind. At the age of 18, I didn’t quite understand what debt really meant. Honestly, I didn’t really know what having to pay any bills at all meant. In high school, I worked jobs that let me pay for fun or easy things like going to the movies, gas money, or improving my wardrobe. I didn’t know what living on my own was going to mean financially and didn’t have an idea of what life after college would look like. Regardless, I always knew from the start that any money used to pay for college was on me to pay back. My parents very nicely offered to supplement my federal loans with Parent Plus loans, but all of that money was my responsibility to repay. It is key for you to make sure you understand who is going to be paying for what if others are involved in your college decision.  I also knew that I wanted to go to a pricier school. I ended up deciding on Penn State which, while a “state” school, comes with a big price tag. Luckily, I was able to talk about the cost of Penn State with my older siblings who also went there. I came to a rough estimate of $20,000ish a year. It was a little more expensive my first two years, and cheaper in the last two when scholarships came through.  All told, I knew I was committing to about $80,000 if I sent in my enrollment papers.  Even though I didn’t have a great grasp on how big that amount actually was, I knew it was a lot.

**Tip #2 – Don’t expect magic to happen. You’re paying for it, so plan for it.**
Even though it felt like money just magically appeared into my bank account at the beginning of each semester, I knew I was going to need a non-magical way to pay that all back eventually. So I started from Day 1 to set myself up for success. I was interested in the humanities in high school, loved History and English, but I didn’t know any History or English majors that were making decent salaries. I had to look elsewhere. On the advice of my sister, I enrolled in a beginning course for a relatively new college at Penn State, called Information Sciences and Technology, in my first semester. I had no previous tech experience, nor did I really know what IST was about. I lucked out, though, and had such a great time in that class that I thought “I can do this.” And I did. I threw myself into networking, coding, databases, project management, organizational alignment, etc. and learned it all with no prior experience. I forced myself into being passionate about a subject that I never even thought about before college. Meanwhile, I made sure to still do what I was interested in, and added a second major, Political Science, to my plan. I worked with my advisors from the beginning to figure out how to get it done in four years, and I then did.

**Tip #3 – Make your loans your Number One Priority.**
Looking for a job during senior year was fun. I had worked hard throughout college, so I was in a good position with a high GPA, internship experiences, and a different and interesting background (“Poli Sci too? That’s cool. Why?”). I also admit to having the advantage of being a woman in a male-dominated field. In 2010, companies were (and I would bet, still are) pushing for diversity in their hiring practices. They couldn’t say that being a woman was advantageous for me, but I knew it was. People who are successful take advantage of opportunities presented to them. I can’t say whether it’s fair or not that I got a leg up on the competition for being a female, but it wasn’t something I was going to work against.  I interviewed with at least ten companies. I had in-hand offers from four. And, at the end of the day, I went with the highest paying offer. Career growth opportunities, job satisfaction, location, etc. are certainly all factors in making an employment decision, but I knew those loan bills were coming in, and I made paying them back my number one priority. So I took the paycheck. 

**Tip #4 – There’s nothing more significant/impactful to paying back debt than your income.**
To have money left over at the end of the month, you need to make more than you spent. The only ways to accomplish this are to spend less or make more. I absolutely made every day choices to lower my overall spending, from never having cable to taking the subway instead of a cab. I made sure that a lot of my little financial decisions were sound. None of that, though, compares to just having a whopping paycheck come in each month. The best thing you can do for your financial goals is to have an income to support them. It helped me to not feel like I was pinching pennies all the time. 

**Tip #5 – Current salary can dictate future salary + always look for a better opportunity.**
Related, I have found in my own experience, that my starting salary influenced all my future salaries significantly. I worked for two years at a big consulting firm, and got a raise each year. Using that as my benchmark, I was able to be picky, but open, to new job opportunities. For a while, any reasonable-sounding job sent my way via LinkedIn, I interviewed for. Once I found a company (through a networking connection) that was very compatible with my skill set, I was able to make the move to a new and better job, with a salary jump. I can tell you honestly, I could have a very similar job as I do right now for half of what I’m making now. In business, no matter what people say, a salary is used as an indicator of performance, and people will pay for what they perceive as value. I also made sure to **ask for more.** Remember, they want to get you for as little they can, but when they like you and want you, companies will give you more than you think they would. I always put out what I considered to be unreasonable requests, and yet, I never got “We don’t want you anymore. Never mind.” It’s always, “Well, here’s where we can meet you on that request.”

**Tip #6 – You are not your friends.**
Unfortunately, you didn’t get the easy button for life. Your parents didn’t pay your way through college, but all your friends’ parents did for them. UNFAIR. Or, your friends are always going to expensive dinners and eating out for lunch and just bought a new Ford Focus, and you want to too! You need to tell yourself “I am not them. I don’t have those luxuries. I don’t have a winning lotto ticket.” I, of course, dealt (and still deal) with that. Did I like driving the 2000 Dodge Intrepid with a broken seat, peeling paint, and a horrible screeching noise every time I locked the doors? Nope, but I drove it until it died. Then I bought a very sensible 2007 Honda Civic and plan on keeping that for ten more years. My friends can enjoy their awesome Mustangs and Focuses, and I will get along with my little economic car. I will be enjoying my new debt-free life. And that’s important to me. I’m not my friends so we don’t have the same goals. I don’t bother comparing my life to theirs. 

And finally,

**Tip #7 – Always ask yourself: “Do I want this more so much that I am willing to delay my future goals of: XXX”**
I have financial goals. They include(d): 

A)	Paying off student loan debt

B)	Affording a nice apartment

C)	Owning a home

D)	Paying for my future children’s college

E)	Retiring without financial worries

These are things that are important to me in my financial life. Times when I was trying to decide whether to make a purchase that didn’t fit my budget, I would try to ask myself if it was worth it to delay my timeline on those items. That would help me to put down those beautiful leather boots that I knew I would wear all the time and would definitely get a great value for. It would also empower me to say yes sometimes. I’ve now traveled to Europe: Italy, Ireland, Germany, Czech Republic, Norway. I feel ok about delaying my future home buying in order to experience something as amazing as travel. By thinking of your smaller financial decisions in context of those larger ones, it helps you to remember your priorities and logically evaluate whether it’s worth it to delay them. 

I hope this was helpful for some people who are working through their own pile of debt. Just remember, you will pay it off. It’s up to you on how fast you can accomplish it. 

**TL;DR:** If you sign up for a big bill, plan to pay it back, take advantage of opportunities, be your own advocate, don’t compare yourself to others, and remember your priorities.",finance,1450397301

My family doesn't have a culture of responsible money managing and since I started working that I had a hard time with using it properly, until I saw the light and started budgeting in the beginning of this year and after 12 months of struggle I'm debt free! Meanwhile my mom kept making bad financial decisions. I tried to show her how cool it was to have a budget and she said that she was interested but never really cared; She lives with her husband and my half-brother so what she does with her life isn't my problem and I never bothered too much. 

She started dating her husband about 4 years ago after she and her ex-husband divorced. Her new husband was fairly well financially and was probably able to live the rest of his life doing a few freelancing jobs as a web designer just now and then. He had savings, drove an old car and lived in a modest apartment; About a year after they started dating, both sold their apartments and bought a luxurious home; The house had to be furnished accordingly; Then he sold his old car and bought a new one. She adopted 4 dogs from the street then quit her job and started living for the house, dogs and her son. 

I saw her buying new useless stuff all the time such as branded clothes for my brother, clothes for her, she made a breast implant and a liposuction because she said she was fat (she wasn't, and many of my friends commented on how hot she was), she also gave me a lot of expensive clothes and furniture too, to the point that I felt uncomfortable because I knew it was his money. Then after a while she got fed up with the house because it was too big and they moved to an apartment in the capital that was about the same price of the old house but things there are more expensive there. After they moved to the capital, she started to go to college and although the tuition isn't expensive (about €1000/year), she doesn't work and everything's on him, who doesn't have a stable source of income and his websites haven't been selling as they expected.

And you know how this story ends: They're completely broke. Last month I got a call from my mom, she said they were broke because her ex-husband hadn't paid the child support, her husband hadn't yet received money from a website he had made and she tried getting a €15k loan from the bank but they wouldn't give it to him because they don't have a stable source of income and would need a creditor and asked if I could be her creditor. I was highly reluctant to become a creditor for the same reason the bank didn't want to offer a loan, so instead I said that I could advance her the €200 for the car's insurance that I'd give her anyway because my car's in her name and she's the one who pays for the insurance. This money would give them enough time to set things straight, or so I wished.

Today I got a call from her, she asked if I could talk. She said that it would be easier if I got the same €15k loan in my name since my records are clean and she would pay everything back. It's a 5 year loan with an EAPR of 13.1%. Now obviously I don't want to contract a loan but I want to help anyway for several reasons: She's my mom, my brother lives with her and she already helped me a lot in the past because of my shitty financial decisions. Her plans weren't specific and seemed risky like hell: She wanted a bigger loan than she needed and would leave about €5k with me so I'd be able to pay for the months she failed. All the money would come from him selling websites, which isn't stable; and she'd keep studying and not working because it's the dream of her life and she *must* finish it but she'd help him selling the websites because she worked as a saleswoman for most of her life. Now she didn't even have a plan on how they'd spend the money and when I asked what are her monthly expenses, she could barely tell. I asked her to go through her bank record and create a spreadsheet with everything that she's spent money with since the beginning of the year and to call me later, so that I could try to help them figuring out a way out of this mess. She said she was going to call me at night but it's already 11:30PM and I haven't received a call yet.

Meanwhile I took notes of what she said she spent with utilities, fuel, insurances, taxes, clothes, etc, etc. And they spend about €800/month. I put everything on a spreadsheet, and got to the conclusion that they have to make on average €910 each month, during 5 years, in order to put up with their expenditure and the interest.

Now I don't know what to do because in one hand, right now, they don't have any money and the bills are piling up. They already cut their electricity last week and my little brother lives with them. Getting the loan is a really really bad idea because not only I'll be enabling bad habits but I'll also risk setting myself on fire too; But if they don't get money soon enough, they're going to be out of food and the basic stuff.

This whole blocksize drama over the past year is actually based on a totally false premise: that somehow you have to ""beg"" the Core / Blockstream devs, or ""debate"" with them, or get some kind of ""consensus"" from them.

But they actually have no power of over you at all.

When's the last time Bitcoin users begged the Fed or Ben Bernanke or Janet Yellen or Christine Lagarde to do something?

So why are we wasting our time begging and debating for the past year with Core / Blockstream devs such as Gregory Maxwell and Adam Back and Peter Todd, who are simply ignoring everything we tell them?

---

You can tell how weak the Core / Blockstream devs actually are by the desperate tactics they engage in: 

- evading questions;

- supporting censorship: 

- using domains squatted by the censor theymos such as /r/bitcoin and bitcoin.org;

- refusing to let /u/Peter__R present his important paper on [Blocksize as Policy Tool or Emergent Phenomenon](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3s525y/the_size_of_blocks_policy_tool_or_emergent/) at ""their"" Hong Kong conference;

- trying to silence other devs (eg, ostracizing and attacking Hearn, or the bizarre suggestion from drak on IRC that Gavin could somehow be ""prevented"" from using free open-source code).
 
---

The Core / Blockstream decision-making process, based on:

- a small group of Core / Blockstream devs ACKing and NACKing proposals on their mailing list;

- (and now more recently) payments and incentives behind the scenes at Blockstream

...is totally disconnected from the actual needs and requirements of actual Bitcoin users, and dangerous to Bitcoin at the technical, systemic, and technical level.

Other devs such as JGarzik have recently pointed this out, and businesspeople are listening:

https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3x4iqk/jeff_garzik_i_have_never_seen_this_much/

&gt; Jeff Garzik: ""I have never seen this much disconnect between user wishes and dev outcomes in 20+ years of open source."" ... ""The worst possible outcome is letting the ecosystem randomly drift into the first Fee Event without openly stating the new economic policy choices and consequences.""

---

Fortunately, in order to remove the Core / Blockstream devs from power, you don't have to engage in debating or begging at all.

All you have to do is ignore them and **un-install the crippled Core / Blockstream code, and install Bitcoin code from other devs** that will actually do what you want (eg, BIP 101 / XT).

What are the Core / Blockstream devs going to do then - stamp their feet and throw a temper-tantrum?

Begging them and debating them has merely been feeding into their totally unjustified sense of their own importance - and our totally unjustified sense of our own powerlessness.

*You* actually have all the power.

A little over a year ago, I had some physical therapy done which should have been to the tune of $250 out of pocket. The clinic that did the work sent a bill for $550ish, which launched into a very long time trying to get it adjusted.

Sparing the details, it took me the better part of a very frustrating year to get it straightened out with them. 

A few months ago I receive a phone call that my bill has been sent to collections. At that point I was calling my insurance on a weekly, then daily basis until it was finally cleared up. My insurance company sends new checks to the clinic, and I start calling them to see if they have gotten them on a weekly basis. After a month, my insurer started calling as well and not even getting through.

After that, I leave another message, and finally get a callback, they say they have the checks but will have to call back with what the bill has been adjusted to.

A week or two later, I leave another sting of calls and messages, and get a call back.

So now, after the adjustment has finally cleared, they are telling me the bill has been adjusted to around $250, but I owe $500ish dollars still, nearly %100 interest on my original bill.

As of right now, my credit has taken a hit, my insurance has paid out they amount they should have, but the clinic is telling me they can't take the bill out of collections, or even adjust the interest rate.

What are my options to at the very least minimize the damage. I have not paid a thing towards it yet, as I don't want to do the wrong thing and end up losing money. To complicate things further, I have just moved across the country so any options involving small claims court or showing up in person are out. There very well could have been a written notice, but I did not catch it. Any advice is greatly appreciated, money is tight, and while I could swing it, I'd much rather not.",finance,1450402582

personalfinance,Pay off student loans in deferment first or higher interest loans first?,So my fiancé has student loans and started working and I understand that the avalanche method is best after all loans have interest that starts accruing. The question I have is do we pay off the accrued interest first for unsubsidized loans? Ex. Loan A - 170000 has an interest rate of 6.5% and is currently outstanding and Loan B - 22500 with an interest rate of 5.0% but is in deferment until March. Do we use our ability to pay 3000 a month to pay down the accrued interest and balance to the loan B first or pay to the loan A and the interest associated?,finance,1450402659

Apparently, what happened on Wednesday what exactly what everyone wanted. “The anticipation is over—we have liftoff. It shows the economy continues to grow here in the United States,” said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners.

And the markets threw off all the bad news about oil prices, and the rally began.

And **18 hours later it was over.**  From 2:30 pm Wednesday to 8:30 am Thursday, nobody remembers one iota of good news.  We still had 69 months of job creation; unemployment is down to a level not thought possible; inflation remains a distant threat.  All forgotten with the setting of the sun.

$140,000 - sales price

$680 - P&amp;I payment (5.125%)

$150 - est property taxes

$  75 - est homeowner's insurance

$905 - total est payment

""You'll notice the interest rate is about a point higher than normal. It's because there's no pmi on this program. PMI (private mortgage insurance) is required whenever you aren't putting 20% down. Normally you would pay about $60 per month towards pmi. However, with this program, you don't pay any pmi and though your interest rate is higher, it ends up performing well against other programs with pmi. Closing costs and pre-paids, which includes setting up an escrow account and your first year's insurance premium will be about $4,500 for this program. However, you can negotiate the sellers to pay most of these costs to apply as much of the $15K grant towards your down payment. Or if the sellers refuse to pay these costs, you can use a portion of the grant to cover these costs too. The sellers can only pay up to 3% of the sales price towards these closing costs/pre-paids.""

personalfinance,Advice on student loan debt. $140k; lawyer; high potential earning capacity.,"I need some advice from the pf community on handling student loan debt. I have approximately $140k in federal student loans to pay for law school (these are both subsidized and unsubsidized), but luckily no private loans or undergrad loans. 

I am pretty fresh out of law school, so I don't have much savings and no retirement. I have credit card debt from 3 years of living expenses while in school, and have a budget to have that paid off in 1-3 months. 

I currently make a upper-mid 5 figure salary, with potential to increase exponentially over the next 5-7 years. My first year out, I hardly made any money, thus no savings or retirement to speak of. I worked very hard to pay off credit cards (which are at 0% interest), and have a budget in place to save approx. 1500 month towards an emergency fund this coming year after all other expenses and spending money. 

My question in how to handle student loan debt that sits at about 7.5% interest. I am currently on IBR and making the minimum payment based on my income. My understanding is that the loans will be forgiven after 25 years, but I will pay interest on the forgiven amount. I looked into the new REPAYE, but am concerned with the tax/income implications if you are married (S.O. makes good salary that I don't want counted against me). 

Here is my question, do I focus on building an emergency fund/savings/retirement now and make the minimum payments on my loans for the next 5 or so years until my salary increases, or try to pay off the loans now? I know the strategy is to pay off high interest debt first, but my current income just won't allow it. 

It doesn't help that the different repayment plans are insanely confusing to differentiate. I just don't want to be in a position where I will not be able to get married/buy a home/etc. for 15 years, but I also don't want to be in a position where I will be making $250k in ten years and pay $5k a month in student loans. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1450455926

personalfinance,Need advice paying down student loan debt,"Hello reddit. I've been lurking here in r/personalfinance for a while and I feel I should reach out here for some advice.

About me: I'm a 23 (turning 24 end of this month) year old who graduated from a UC (in 2014) with a degree in Biology. I have a pretty chill full time job at a biotech company (started in May 2015) making 33.5k/yr (however, it's probably much lower, like around 25-26k due to taxes). I graduated with a total of 32k in federal student loans, but I got it down to 29k (I feel quite proud!). What got me a bit disturbed, however, is that my mom hid the fact she had to take out private loans from Sallie Mae to help pay for my college, an amount of 7.8k with ridiculous interest rates. The reason I'm a bit mad is because 1)she never told me about them and thought last night was a good time to tell me about them and 2) she lashes out at me when I talk to her or offer to help out on finances. I've gotten over the fact that she'll never change and I've accepted the fact that these loans helped me attend and graduate college.

Anyway, here's the break down!

Nelnet:
A: 3418.17 @ 4.5% (sub loan)
B: 7752.23 @ 6.8% (unsub loan)
C: 6738.15 @ 3.4% (sub loan)
D: 4392.39 @ 3.4% (sub loan)
F: 5473.02 @ 3.86% (sub loan)
G: 2089.89 @ 3.86% (sub loan)

ACS:
~2.1k @ 5% &lt;- I'm actually not worried about this loan because I just pay $100 a month (minimum payment is $76.14), but just wanted to put it in in case you guys had any advice. I had a starting loan from ACS of 2.8k, jsyk.

Sallie Mae:
4990.32 @ 11.8%
2823.98 @ 12.38%
Minimum payments for these is ~$183

Yes, I am on IBR (because I had part-time employment during Oct 2014 - Apr 2015, but had really few hours to even afford my minimum payment) and I'm planning on re-certifying (yes, I know monthly payments will increase due to an increase in my salary).

My major expenses are:
Rent ($500/month)
Gas ($140-160/month)
Phone ($99/month)
Car Insurance ($55/month)
Student loan payments to ACS and Sallie Mae only: ~$283
Overall: ~1070 to ~1097 a month

I use YNAB (thank you based-god YNAB) to keep track of where my money goes. I thank my parents for food, so I don't eat out. Because of that, this leaves me with an extra ~1k leftover (I take whatever is left over and save it) every month. I already do have an emergency fund (~3k) in case shit hits the fans.

I really would like to put this extra 1k towards my student loans, but I don't know how to start my plan of attack. I was planning on staying on IBR so I can attack and pay off my last unsubsidized loan, and then Attack my private loans aggressively. Help me out reddit?

The interest rates for a traditional loan are too high, and I don't have enough equity in my home to get a home equity loan.  I also would prefer not to move.

I'm reading you can now have unlimited net worth and still get Medi-Cal in California - for zero per month.,"Apparently in California there is now NO ASSET LIMIT to be eligible for medi-cal (same as medicaid in other states?) which appears to be free if your income is under 1200 a month if you are single/no children/age 19-64/able bodied.

This seems like a really affordable plan(zero cost?) as long as you make sure no income gets reported to the feds up to 24k?  I will be 'living off investments' so I suppose I can sell all the stock I want yearly as long as the profits were under 24k a year then I would be eligible for the zero cost plan. 

Another option is subsidized plan with ACA but that has similar income limits.

It seems like if you had 10 years of income in liquid assets/cash equilvalents in the bank you would have a good ten years of medi-cal at zero cost per month. I suppose at age 65 there is no income limit for medi-cal then you could have whatever income yearly you wanted?

I'm really sickened by the 'working class' plans where you pay $500+ per month with a large deductible - thats just very expensive bankruptcy insurance. I suppose there are drawbacks to medi-cal, but I could always pay cash for a 'good doctor' if I wanted or healthcare tourism to india for hip replacement/etc if the Medi-Cal plan didnt cover something - its probably very basic insurance and doesnt pay or cover much from what I read.

I apologize ahead of time this could be a relationship or careeradvice thread but this sub seems to also have some reasonable people. I also understand we are in a fortunate position. This could be a humble-brag but I could use some advice so please look past that.


My spouse is currently finishing up medical training in the next 12 months. I feel it is my duty to allow her to follow her career as her specialty and interests will require her to go to one of not many programs. I love my wife and want her to be able to follow her dreams. I am not going to lie, I could use a change of scenery.


We are in a very good financial situation for a 30 year old couple. We live in a good sized mid-western city so pretty good COL.


My Salary: 300k (Recently doubled)

Her Salary: 60k

Investments: 600k

Home Equity: 140k

Mortgage: 540k with a 4% interest rate

No other debt.


So everything looks pretty good right? Here is the problem... I don't think I can find a job at my current pay rate in cities she would be targeting. I have worked at the same company my entire career, watched my company sell and have progressed pretty rapidly up the chain. My value is deeply entrenched in my reputation. i could swing working remote for a bit but frankly I don't think it would work out.


My wife won't make the same salary, topping at 150k. I could maybe find something at about half of my current salary? To be honest, I don't even know how to look for jobs at this point. To complicate matters even further... we have a bun in the oven :)


Are we crazy for leaving our current set-up? I have good trajectory if I stay where I am and could easily see my salary doubling or tripling in the next few year. At the same time my wife would be heartbroken after all of this training to not practice in her specialty.

personalfinance,New budget- what to pay back first (not CCs),"Okay, so I'll be as short with my explanation as possible. My husband got a job at a foundry, where he makes an hourly rate, but he also makes incentive depending on how much he is able to produce. If he works on a Saturday, he gets time and a half, Sunday's get double time. Obviously, his paycheck is incredibly varied. He's in the national guard, so on weeks that he has drill, he can usually only get in a few days of work, resulting in small paychecks that can average around $350, or more depending. He can also get up to $900+ in a week, too. 

Anyway, so with my paychecks, I get around $1600 a month on my own. That's after taxes, 401k, and savings withdrawal. And he could make $1400+ in a month. So I worked out a budget that has bills being paid each week that they're due, and at the end of the month, I have a surplus of $76. This is also not including his National Guard check because that can vary depending on if he's there 2 or 3 days. 

But, again, that's if he makes the bare minimum, and usually he doesn't. But I don't want to budget for a paycheck that may not be. 

So here's where I have my dilemma. We've gotten behind on payments on things. He wasn't able to find a job anywhere, despite excellent qualifications, because our area just doesn't have good jobs. You're either a doctor or you work at McDonalds. There are very few middle grade jobs. I was lucky enough to land one after a long time of trying. My BA just isn't important. So he finally gets a part time job at Target which helped us squeak by, but we were having to prioritize bills.

Anyway, we're almost $3k behind on our house payment, $1000 or so is just straight up late fees that have built up. We're 1 month behind on our power bill, owe $300ish in total. 1 month behind on gas, owe around $115. 1 month behind on our phone bill, owe around $300. 3 months behind on his car payment, owe around $1100. And around 3 months behind on student loans, so I owe around $2000 on those to be caught up. I think there are a couple other things, but not super big. 

So now that I've budgeted everything out to where I pay it on time with a small surplus, and to where I'm underestimating how much I will have as surplus, what should I put my money toward to catch up on first? 

It just stumps me because they're not credit cards, so I can't just look at interest rates. The car payment and student loans have really small interest rates. And in any case, I'm not looking to do the pay off one at a time method, I'll worry about that after catching up. 

So any advice?

TL;DR - new budget gives us surplus, which bills should I catch up on first?

EDIT FOR CLARITY: As I sat here, I made it sound like its a simple matter of what to put extra money towards. What I guess my big question is, is what should I concentrate on first when I'm at the point where each bill HAS to get paid or things get shut off. Because I have specified certain bills to be paid on certain weeks, due to how much is coming in that week.",finance,1450485010

I still have this same credit card and I'm offered very frequently other credit cards with quite lower interest rates.

Bitcoin,"The last straw: an egregious, privacy-violating inquisition by Coinbase","On 1 December, I received an email from Coinbase:

&gt; Thank you for your interest in Coinbase! We know that you have a choice when it comes to bitcoin services and we are grateful to have you as a customer.
&gt; 
&gt; As part of our compliance program, we're required to review high volume accounts. As a regulated financial institution we're required to understand how our customers use our service. Please help us complete this review by providing some additional information about your account.

This seemed like a reasonable request on the face of it, but one of the questions in the three-part questionnaire struck me as somewhat odd:

&gt; How do you acquire bitcoin, and what is the source of funds used in acquiring those bitcoin? (i.e. occupation, trading, investing, mining, etc...)

Alright, sure, I guessed they wanted to know whether I'm engaged in a business that handles bitcoins. I am not, so I answered:

&gt; I am not presently acquiring bitcoins.

This is true, and it answered their question. How do I acquire bitcoins? I don't (anymore).

Well, apparently this wasn't the question they meant to ask. The next day, I received another message from them:

&gt; Thanks for your reply, Matt. Can you please update your answer to the second question, this time also addressing the source(s) of BTC you received in the past?

I was miffed by this intrusion into my financial privacy, so I returned to the questionnaire and added this to my response:

&gt; Frankly, this is none of your business, and you're invading my privacy by asking. This is the kind of question that Bitcoin was invented to save us all from.
&gt; 
&gt; * I have never received wages or compensation in bitcoins.
&gt; * I have never mined bitcoins.
&gt; * I have received bitcoins from a variety of sources, and these bitcoins are now commingled.
&gt; * I do not keep records of my bitcoin transactions.
&gt; * All of the bitcoins I sell on Coinbase are mine.
&gt; * I am not engaged in any money services business.

That should have addressed all of their concerns and shamed them a little bit for prying, right?

Wrong. Just yesterday (16 days later), I received another email from them:

&gt; Hi Matt. Can you please update your response to the second question to include the source of funds used for your past purchases on Coinbase? And I understand that you can't tell us the source of every single incoming BTC transaction, but can you please tell us what you can about where the incoming bitcoins originated?

Now I was livid. I returned to the questionnaire and added the following to my response:

&gt; This is far more information than you need to know, and you're severely overreaching by pressing for more. I have a right to my privacy, including my financial privacy, and you are attempting to violate that right. I have been using Coinbase because you are convenient and, until now, have not hassled me, but this recent inquisition goes beyond the pale. Are you willing to sacrifice the mutually beneficial business relationship we've built to date? I do not wish to do business with anyone who disrespects me to such degree as you are now doing. Shame on you, your company, and your cowardly lawyers who must have demanded that you interrogate your customers to this offensive extreme.

I have not heard back yet, but I expect them to close my account. :(

**TL;DR:** If you do enough business with Coinbase, their overly paranoid compliance department will force you to choose between completely giving up your financial privacy or walking away. The Bitcoin revolution cannot come soon enough.",cryptocurrency,1450531813

I am:

- 21 years old
- Live in Florida
- In a public university. My FAFSA EFC is 0. I receive full financial aid of which about 70 percent is grants and my state's scholarship (bright Futures). The rest is federal loans.
- My parent's, who file jointly, make about 20k annually combined. They claim me as a dependent, as well as my under-18 sister.
- This year my income consists of financial aid and Uber and Lyft driving. I am supposed to get a 1099 at the end of the year for each. I started driving in April 2015.
- I have saved about 13% of my payments for tax if I need to pay tax. 
- I have an app which reports and estimated total of my miles driven (while on a ride, not in general) in the year. However, I did not keep a mileage log. 
- My earnings with Uber are (so far): $2,999
- My earnings with Lyft are (so far): $2,234
- My total earnings are (so far): $5,233

Tax time, I go to the same guy my father goes to to file taxes, and he takes care of everything. However, I would like to know the following:

- Since I made over $400 in self-employment income, I have to FILE taxes, correct?
- As a dependent student, with earnings of about $5,500 total in the year, will I actually OWE any taxes or will I owe 0 due to the $6,200 dollar standard deduction?

I will be 24 at the end of this year and am currently looking into getting a credit card...while we are on that subject does anyone recommend a type of credit card I should get given my financial situation?

personalfinance,Formula for figuring out principle payments (credit cards or home mortgages),"Hi,

I am trying to do some calculations to explore different scenarios not only with my credit cards but also with home loans.

Wife an I are looking into purchasing a home at least by next year, but I want to make sure I understand the true total cost. One thing I'm trying to figure out is total cost of fees.

To do this however I need a better idea of when you have  a home payment, how much of that payment is the principal.

For example, I know that if you take the APR and divide it by 12 months, and then subtract it from your payment, well of course that gives you the percentage of principle paid.

However, I would like to know how they figure out the percentage in the first place. That way I can plug in different numbers. I can also project fee cost out over the timeline.

The primary reason for my wanting to know this is in regard to USDA home loans. They are zero downpayment loans in rural areas, to encourage people moving to those areas ( I belive they are also structured to help lower income individuals too)

Part of the USDA loan however is a yearly fee of 0.5%. 

This fee is calculated every year on the remaining balance and must be paid off within every 12 months.

What I'm trying to determine is how much that fee adds up to , over a 30 year loan. To me it seems like it would be a lot of money!

However, of course as you pay down your principle it will decrease. If I know the interest rate, and I know the starting principle, of course I can calculate then over time what the fee adds up to be.

But I think the problem I have here is, say I make payements for the first year. At the end of the year, the next year's fee will be calculated. 

Other than taking the loan office's payment amount and breaking the year's interest off of it to get the payment principle percentage, is there any rule to how much percentage the principle usually is of a payment? That way I can reliable calculate how much the fee drops over time, to figure out the total fee cost over the 30 year loan.

Just wondering if there is some basic formula for how the bank decides how much the payment should be (amount over top of interest payments)

I dont think any of the calculators I've found can do ""reverse"" interest like that?

Or perhaps I'm just not understaning stuff correctly.

My main theory is that 0.5% fee on the remaining balance adds up to quite a number in the end. Possibly even higher than if you had a 20% down payment (as usual poor people end up paying more for things), but I'd like to be able to calculate it to know for sure.

In fact it's worse than that, since a downpayment takes money out of the principle immediately, vs these fees will become essentially the whole principle + more money equivalent to a downpayment...! crazy! Along with the normal interest 

FHA loans charge a flat fee of 3000, but then I read if you are under 20% downpayment of course you need to get PMI. And then I read that if you are under 5% downpaymetn, the PMI *never goes away, ever!*

Real Estate just seems like such a racket! Lots of additional fees

So far, I can say that preliminary research into a home ..wow so much cost to get into one! Haha.",finance,1450574712

The charge is for about $150, and the report states it was created in September of last year, and went into collections that November.

However, I never received a bill in my name from them at any point. I'm also wondering why the report says the charge was issued last year, when I haven't even talked to that surgeon in over four years.

personalfinance,23 Year Old [M] in a Good Spot Trying to Plan for the Future,"Hello PF, I recently graduated college and began my first job in September after a successful Summer internship. Things are going pretty great in my life (amazing girlfriend, sweet cat, good roommates, etc.) and now the only thing that gives me any anxiety is the need to plan for the future. I want to retire early and live off of my investments, and I'm ready to do some serious saving in order to do that :)

I know very little about investing, saving, or budgeting; only as much as the wiki here has given me. Currently, I'm leaning towards opening a Roth IRA account, but I still wanted to get suggestions from all of you. 

I make $75k a year pre-tax in Seattle, WA and am expecting a small promotion with a raise to ~80k by the end of February. I have one credit card with a $2500 limit. My current expenses are ~$1300 a month rent/utilities/internet and ~$600 a month for everything else (groceries/entertainment/gifts/services/clothes/cat litter/appointments etc.). That's it. No car payments, mortgage or insurance (thinking of getting it soon though for zip-car), or any other credit card/medical debt, just student loans. I'm saving about $3k a month right now. 

I currently have $10k saved up and my first student loan payment is due mid-January. This is the breakdown of my $25k in student loans (chronological order):


Loan Type | Principal Balance | Interest Rate
---|---|----
Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan| $3500.00 | 3.4%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan| $349.01 | 6.8%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan| $7811.77 | 6.8%
Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan| $3512.69 | 3.86%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan| $4361.48 |  3.86%
Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan| $5500.00 | 4.66%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan| $290.60 | 4.66%

I'm thinking I should try to pay off the 6.8% loans as soon as possible but then make minimum payments because even a boring portfolio of investments should be higher than 4.6% annually right?

I also have not been putting any of my paychecks into my work's 401k plan, they don't do any matching so I was thinking there wasn't any point in contributing towards it. Is this a mistake? And if it is, do I have until mid-April to get to my 18k yearly limit or do my chances for this year's contribution expire in two weeks?

I was looking at opening a Vanguard account for a Roth IRA and looking up how to do this 3-fund plan everyone talks about, does that seem like my best option? I'm pretty risk averse.

ethereum,"Idea for building a sidechain ""gear"" using a set of DAOs","Preface: Bare with me this is not a simple post.

So at present there are a several attempts at building sidechains. Many of them, honestly very technical. 

What I am thinking is why not build a ""gear"" that simply pulls another chain, instead of having a sidechain per se. If you can visualize it, imagine Bitcoin as an enormous chain with two major gears on it. A side chain gear in this metaphor would be a gear that has no impediment to the main chain, but gets pulled by the chain, and in turn pulls another (possibly wholy independent) chain. Everyone using Bitcoin is basically a gear. The events on the chain cause us to move (receiving payment) or we move the chain (making payment). Exchanges would be the most obvious examples of gears between chains. 

The specific type of gear I'm trying to imagine has to do with a chain sending money somewhere and having a proportional token appear on another chain in a 1:1 ratio **and then back again**.

Trivially we could accomplish this with federated pegs. IE we make a Bitcoin multisig with either ""m-of-7"" or ""m-of-15"" signatories. Of course the problem is that don't like federated pegs because they will cause a small set of key holders and as such is vulnerable.

I want to suggest that we stay with federated pegs but use a DAO to massively increase the number of signatories and rotate pockets of signatories so that the risk of compromise begins to approach a negligible level. 

We need a few components to do this.

1. A ""sign please"" contract. A contract which allows people to generate priv-pub key sets, then submit the pub key. Consumers can then submit content for signing by specific pub keys, paying a small fee as a reward to the signer. This contract also has a report function where anything that has been signed by a priv key holder can be submitted, if it has never been submitted to the contract (IE the signer is trying to cheat), the contract marks that participant as dubious (which may also result in a loss of deposit). 

2. The exit address creation contract. This contract is in charge of creating the exit addresses for use on the main chain. To create an exit address, it solicits a set public keys for each signatory from the ""sign please"" contract. It uses the additive properties of EC to compile a signatory set. It can then be queried for the exit address. It has thresholds for when an exit address begins to get compromised (IE, when too many priv key holders have been seen signing things they weren't supposed to, or have been ignoring instructions to sign things they were supposed to). If these thresholds are breached it generates a new exit address and a TX to move the funds to the new address. 

3. The side coin contract. Basically it's job is to just create coins in proportion to the money coming in, and burn coins in proportion to the money going out, and generate the main chain TX to move money to new recipients. It can optionally also have a function used to decrease the total volume of sidecoins to the confirmed input volume should some of the funds on the main chain be compromised. (This contract can have exclusive rights on the first contract to ensure no one else asks for things to be signed via that contract)

Incentives for the key signers are that they get a small income every time they are asked to sign a TX. Exit TX's can optionally also pay them main chain tokens on exit, increasing their incentives to not have their keys compromised, and to sign promptly and regularly. Their entire responsibility should of course be automated. 

So this takes a federated key peg and adds a massive amount of signatories and pools them into pockets. Let's assume a pocket contains 10 signatories, each pocket being a signatory of a 5-of-15 multisig. This means that 5 inclusive pockets of signers must be compromised to move keys (a far more difficult feat than just any 33% of signers). It also ensures that money can be moved to a new account even if some keys have been compromised.

There can also be multiple exit addresses, which would act to contain risk.",cryptocurrency,1450606744

I have a 2k limit credit card of which I use about $500 a month on expenses, and always payoff well before the due date. To improve my credit utilisation, I want to increase my limit. Earlier this year it doubled from 1k to 2k, and I feel like between my recent promotion and my history with the card I should be able to ask to increase the limit up to maybe even 5k. I heard this can cause hard inquiries into my limit. There's a form I can submit online of how much I make, or apparently I can call and try to highball. Which should I do?

personalfinance,"How to make the best use of my money: $80k gross income, $170k in student loans (interest rates from 5.41%-7.9%)","Hi everyone, 

I've read all the wiki areas in /r/personalfinance and just started using YNAB, but I'm still not too sure how to make the best use of my money.  My parents never taught me a thing about finances and struggle with their own finances, so I have been learning even the basics about debt and investment plans by myself. 

**The problem**:
Just passed the bar and am a brand-new lawyer working in Los Angeles, CA, salaried at $80k/year.  I owe about $170k total with high interest rates in federal student loans from law school. Specifically, my loans break down as follows:

- $25k at 6.8%
- $37k at 7.9%
- $23k at 5.41%
- $33.5k at 6.41%
- $22k at 6.21%
- $28.5k at 7.21%

**Current Other Expenses**:

*Rent*: $750/mth including utilities 

- Rent arrangement also includes packaged lunch and dinner most of the time, although I treat the family to a meal (usually costs around $50-75) every couple of weeks.
- I live about 35 miles away from work, which equates to about 1.5-2hrs of driving in traffic *each* way...which brings me to the next expense...

*Gas*: ~$200-250/mth (depending on gas prices)

*Car Lease*: $429/mth (I know it's way too much for my income... Lease ends December 2016 and am planning on buying a cheap, reliable, car...suggestions? I'm thinking a Honda or Toyota since I heard Japanese cars are reliable)

*Dinners/Outings with Friends*:  ~$100/mth (This is a generous estimate - I tend not to go to friend gatherings if they are going to eat out, but quite a few of my friends have been getting engaged recently and those celebratory dinners are quite expensive)

**Long-term Goals**:

1. Pay off debt (in order to do 3 and 4)
2. Buy a car
3. Buy a house of my own
4. Save/invest money for retirement

**Questions**:

1. My loan servicer told me that there is no real monetary benefit in consolidating loans since it will just be a weighted average of all of my interest rates.  The only benefit is that I would be looking at 1 lumped loan with 1 interest rate, so it puts some people at ease.  Is this true?  A friend who has a different loan servicer was told that they also consider credit score, so if you have good credit, your interest rates could be much lower.  My servicer said this is not the case.  Essentially, what are the pros/cons of consolidating?

2. My firm does not match for 401k, and because my interest rates are so high for my loans, I have been told my first priority is to pay down my loans first (which counts as an ""investment"") before investing my money in anything else.  Is this true? 

3. How much per month *should* I be aiming to pay on my loans each month? I'm currently on the income-based repayment (""IBR"") plan (I was concerned about not being able to find a job before), which sets my minimum at about $90/mnth for the next 6 months. My monthly payments before I was approved for IBR was about $1200/mth, but I'm not sure what the rate will be at the end of IBR. 

4. Any other suggestions on the quickest or best way to pay off my student loans?  Critiques on my expenses are also welcome!

personalfinance,Keeping my current car or buying an almost new car- a financial analysis,"I'm trying to decide whether I will keep my older car or buy one that's almost new, and would like your thoughts and suggestions. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I'll begin with my formula to find the monthly cost of a used car, pretty simple really: Take the money you could realistically get for selling your used car, subtract your initial cost and any repairs you made, and divide that by how long you've owned it in months. I don't count tune-ups/oil in this because every car has these costs and they are around the same.

I bought a 2000 Corolla with 113,000 miles (now 126,000) for $2400, and have made around $391 in repairs to it. This is almost exclusively for parts, since I do the repairs myself. If I sell it today, I could realistically get $1556 for it. I've owned it for about 8 months, so that means my monthly cost is around $154.

The reason I started this analysis is because I'd like to do an expensive suspension repair to it. It's not absolutely critical, but it has to be done eventually, and since I have a 5000 mile road trip I'd like to do the repair before then. With the suspension of around $400 ($320 for parts + $80 for alignment) it comes out to around $204 per month.

I am thinking of buying a 2014 Corolla. I might be able to get it certified pre-owned and with a warranty, and those new Corollas are just SO damn pretty. My credit is good enough for an interest rate below inflation, so I would stretch my loan to hopefully 6 years. I am not counting repairs because they are extremely unlikely on a Corolla newer than 6-7 years. After 6 years I *could* sell it, and that would give around $5600 (based on the current used price of a similarly equipped 2008 Corolla). I probably won't sell it, but saying I will is sufficient for this analysis. So I get $5600, minus my down payment and my monthly payment for 6 years, averages out to $149/month. 

So far we have:
Keep old Corolla and my cost is $204/month. Buy newer Corolla and my cost is $149/month.

But here comes the part that's iffy. If I fix my old Corolla, it's possible it'll last some time without more repairs. It's also possible that I could get tons more repairs. We just don't know.

So lets add to the options:
Keep old Corolla and my cost is $204/month. Keep old Corolla for 4 more months (1 year total) and there are no new repairs and my cost goes down to $136/month. Keep old Corolla for 16 more months (2 years total) and there are no new repairs and my cost goes down to $68/month. Buy newer Corolla and my cost is $149/month.

What can we do? I could fix my suspension, and hope the car lasts without having to do more repairs. Honestly, this is pretty likely. At the same time, a newer car with a warranty would not only offer peace of mind, but also greater driving enjoyment, while not necessarily being that much more out of pocket.

Occupation: IT Analyst

Gross Annual Income: $57,200

Roth IRA Balance: $140,700

Net worth: ~$200,000

Current Annual Expenses: $5,000

So my situation is relatively unique considering my parents started an IRA for me at birth and didn't max out the contribution but definitely contributed. My questions are largely personal and I'm also looking for general advice from people who have been in similar situations. 

First and foremost, I'm looking at purchasing a house in the next few years. I'm debating right now if it's worth saving for a larger than 20% down payment and I'm not sure if there's any benefits of doing so other than a lower monthly payment. I'm also not sure if purchasing a house is good for anything other than having my own space and eventually not having that as an expense. My current price range is about $300,000.

Second, I'm not sure if it's worth my money to invest in my retirement past a home so I can eliminate a rather large living expense. Based on the idea that I plan on retiring at 60 or so, I'll have a 2 million dollar nest egg with 0 contributions assuming a 7% growth rate on my Roth IRA. Assuming a similar 7% growth rate I'll be able to withdraw $140,000 annually without touching principle. Assuming 3% inflation, that's only going to be about 20% less than what I make full time. I do understand that money invested now is more important than money invested later though. A big reservation I have about this as well is that when I'm around retirement, I believe it's very possible for my mother to have deceased by then. I expect to be inheriting quite a bit more than that 2 million dollar nest egg at that point in time. 

Third, is there a benefit in getting a 15 year mortgage over a 30 year mortgage? I know that you spend less in interest, but because interest rates are generally lower than market growth rates, is it better to just get a 30 year and invest the difference? On a $300,000 house with current interest rates, the difference between the two payments is almost 700 dollars which represents a large portion of my take home pay.

personalfinance,Looking for feedback on my finances.,"We made more money this year but it only feels like it a little bit.  I would like outside feedback.

I'm 38 with three children, ages 11, 9, and 4.

I'll round to make all figures monthly:

***

Joint net income: $7,200

Life insurance: $66

Auto Insurance: $163

Rent: $1,900

Utilities: $140

Water/Sewer/Trash: $120

Student loans: $718

Credit cards: $360

Car loan: $340

401k loan: $151

Internet: $45

Groceries: $600

Gasoline: $190

Clothing: $150

Gym: $105

Cell phones: $162

After-school Daycare: $200

Extra Debt Payment: $325

Kids' 529 accounts: $60

Miscellaneous: $120

Travel/Vacations: $500

***

This is troubling; I can't account for the extra money (income minus all expenses).  I meticulously *plan* our finances; they just don't track exactly with what I have planned.  

For the credit cards, we have not used credit cards for years, other than to transfer balances to lower rates.  We have a balance of about $17k with an average interest rate of around 4% (temporarily).  This is where the extra debt payments go.  Chalk up the debt to living stupidly early in our marriage.

Between us we have $85k in student loan debt.  Most of that comes from my time in graduate school.

We can't rent for any lower.  We got a steal and routinely look and fail to find alternative housing the meets our family needs.  A move out would mean a move up, and I'm already 90 minutes away from my work.

We used to own both our cars outright.  After months of repairing mine, and having auto failure/lateness start to reflect negatively on me at work, we got a loan for a newer sedan.  I can't have a total beater as I sometimes have clients with me.  The car has $15k left on it.

We contribute only the minimum to get the full company match with our 401k's.  I max out the HSA for two reasons: every damn year we hit our out of pocket maximum, and because it helps reduce our taxable income.  Though I would like to use it for retirement, the reality is that I'll probably burn through most of it each year with medical and dental expenses.  We have a $5,000 out of pocket max and all three kids are going to need braces in the next few years.

I've explored public transit; it just isn't feasible here.

The gym membership is partly reimbursed by my employer.

I'm mainly looking for feedback in two areas:

1) How do I find the ""missing"" income?  

2) What sort of opportunities for improvement do you see?",finance,1450671724
personalfinance,Low interest rate loans - should I knock them out or save/invest?,"I graduated in Dec 2014, secured a good job, and then in true millennial style I moved back in with my folks.  In 2015 I will have paid off about $17k of my $33k of student loans.   Now that I'm starting a new year, I'm wondering if I should change my priorities or remain steady and knock these loans out.  Here's my current outlook:

* Monthly Take-home: $3,500 (after taxes, 401k - Yes, I get my employer match)
* Cash/Savings:  $4,000
* Monthly Obligations: $600ish (not counting loans)
* Loans:  $2,270.99 @ 4.5%,  $10,622.99 @ 3.4%,  and $4,299.04 @ 3.86%. 

&gt;Before someone wants to know where the rest of my money is going: I'm not exactly living frugally.  I took a trip to Yosemite and to the Smoky Mountains.  I enjoy having fun on the weekends and staying in different cities. I bought a used car and a used motorcycle with cash this summer.  And it's been really fun being able to buy nice gifts for my family this year for Christmas. 

For the last 6 months or so, I've been paying $1,000 toward my loans every time I'm paid.  This has worked well to keep me on track and it's been fun watching my debt shrink.  But lately I'm starting to wonder if this is what's best for my money.  Today I looked at my loans again thinking how low that those interest rates are.  Would it be better for me to pay off the 4.5% interest rate loan fast, and then change my payment to something like $400/month, and then save or invest the difference? 

My girlfriend graduates from grad school next December and we're thinking of moving to a bigger city together.  So I would more than likely remain with my folks until that point, and by lowering my loan payment to $400, I could feasibly save $17,600 over the course of 2016.  If I decided to keep this payment, I would pay about $850 of interest over the lifetime of the loans.  And then I'd be investing the saved money, probably with a larger return than 3.86%... key word probably.

dogecoin,Might DOGECOIN Become the New World Currency???,"It's funny, you know, because while some of the biggest voices in financial news (including an article I read on FORBES) are suggesting a strong potential danger that the U.S. Feds may try to abolish the BITCOIN by declaring it a ""money-laundering"" scheme, at the same time, the BITCOIN is actually widely being traded on the U.S. commodities market (e.g., NADEX). Therefore, the fact that BITCOIN is apparently being regarded so highly as to allow its trading to take place on the exchange market would make it seem far from even being remotely likely that the government is effectively going to declare it as being illegal. 

It can nonetheless be assumed the government is looking for ways to ""regulate"" it, however, and trading it over exchanges is evidently one way of providing for some effective regulation. But I believe it's a falsehood to suggest that the BITCOIN (or any other altcoin) for that matter can reasonably be regarded as a money-laundering scheme in and of itself ANYMORE than paper money - or even gold bullion - can reasonably be labeled as such. After all, it is written right on every currency bill in circulation in the United States that, ""This note is legal tender for all debts public and private."" 

The part about the ""private"" bit, despite being printed on bills forever, can be said to be something of an unspoken misnomer, since obviously the government wants, expects and actually mandates (via the IRS) to report monetary profits and large scale monetary transactions even where such profits and transactions are considerate of paper money. They don't want people to keep cash transaction ledgers a secret; and by the same token, you can bet they don't want people to keep BITCOIN transactions a secret either. 

But in the first place, and when it comes to a functional basis of what has made money-laundering possible (e.g., laundering drug money) in the first place, it really is COLD HARD CASH from the outset of monetary history. Being able to move large amounts of cash money around surreptitiously and cloak its origin and destinations in different ways simply makes it feasible to ""launder"" the money. Of course, no one is going to suggest that use of paper money in and of itself amounts to a money-laundering scheme anymore than could be said of gold coins, but rather where it is the essentially ""anonymous"" feature of paper money (and gold) that makes it practical to use in the interest of conducting laundering schemes. In other words, paper money and other forms of hard currency can be used as ""tools"" to facilitate laundering practices, but that the fact of any hard currency is not in itself a money-laundering scheme. Also, there is nothing illegal about paying off debts, or buying merchandise or anything else using gold coins, excepting of course that it is simply not practical for mostly anyone to be carrying around large amounts of gold. 

Paper money is lightweight and more or less easy to conceal, but perhaps easily the one thing nowadays that would drastically trump paper money in view of its physical characteristics is that of digitized ""cryptocurrency,"" since a person could literally hold billions or hundreds of billions of dollars worth of the stuff on a single USB flash drive, or on a smartphone, etc. 

Naturally, in these respects, the governments of the world are not going to want to let this digital currency issue get ahead of them too far before they can figure out a way of effectively more or less regulating the agenda at least in the short term. With that being said, it is at the same time where I tend to fully expect that the U.S. government particularly wants to be careful in not jumping the gun, so to speak, when it would come to overly harsh restrictions, much less than to say outright criminalization, being placed on use of the BITCOIN, because of a case for which lawmakers would no doubt view it in their best interests to understand the overall potential viability of this new commodity from a technical standpoint; and presumably for which they would want to understand it in a way that is beneficial to some long-standing alleged goals on the parts of governments around the world to one day be able to completely abolish paper money and move over to a completely digital form of currency transaction system. 

After all, with no paper money out there, and also no other practical means of conducting large-scale money-laundering operations, fully digitized money transactions would largely, if not completely, destroy the underground economies of narcotics' trafficking, weapons' trafficking and so forth around the world. 

In summary, though, to all of this rhetoric I'm making here, it occurs to me that the way in which the ""DOGECOIN"" cryptocurrency particularly is initially being set up in an operational framework is such that the digital model of the DOGECOIN might actually end up being the catalyst used for eventual implementation of an elitist worldwide currency and, hence, fulfillment for the dreaded sometimes-religious prophesy of a coming -- ""NEW WORLD ORDER"" and World Government!

With all of this in mind to view what many people will likely perceive as being far-fetched and fanciful speculation on my part to consider the potential future for the DOGECOIN, here's a Wikipedia article to read that will, among other things, offer to enlighten you about how on the one hand the Chinese government has worked to effectively criminalize use of the BITCOIN, but on the other hand where that same government is ACTUALLY seen to be ""embracing"" adoption of the DOGECOIN... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin",cryptocurrency,1450717282

personalfinance,[Debt] My Student Loan Repayment breakdown. Any tips would be helpful,"Thank you to those who are taking time to read this and respond to help me out. 

(Also, let me apologize for any formatting errors as I have not created such a long reddit post before! I will re edit as I see fit!)


I've been lurking for a while, and notice that sometimes there are tips for which loan to tackle first whether one loan has a lower interest, etc. So I thought I'd share my breakdown, as my loans will be in repayment as of January 2016. 



It took me six years to complete my undergraduate degree. I have Federal Loans from two years, and then Private Loans for four years after I transferred states and colleges.


Federal Loans- 

I'll just upload an [image of the breakdown](http://i.imgur.com/3MYZBxC.png)-- my current balance is $33,856.49.

Monthly Payment: **$357.40**

I am not so worried about the Federal Loans. It's the private ones that make me queasy:



* 20k at 8% (Current balance: $23,957.44)

* 22k at 7.5% (Current balance: $24,861.17)

* 22k at 7.5% (Current Balance: $24,771.15)

Monthly payment: **$782.74**

* 11k at 9.63% (Current Balance: $11,882.69)

Monthly Payment: **$139.49**

**edit: all the private loans have variable interest rates**

*Total Monthly Payments for Federal+Private Loans:* **$1279.63**


Now, about my finances. I am recently married. My husband makes 50k before taxes and insurance costs. I make 20k before taxes and insurance. This is because I am a Teaching Fellow, paid on a stipend through a program. I expect my salary to raise after June as I will (hopefully!) be finding work as a legit teacher with higher pay.

* Husband brings home **~$2679.22/month** after taxes and insurance. 
* I bring home **~1547.72/month** after taxes and (some) insurance.

Currently, we have little expenses--mainly gas. We are living with his parents (and with our two cats) temporarily as we had to move out of state with no time to find a place of our own for our new jobs. The commute to work is still quite far compared to how often we have to be there, so we are looking to move soon. (The living situation is less than ideal) 


Currently in our bank account we have ~$15,500 from living rent free for three months (plus a little savings from before.) Before moving here, we spent little money compared to most people our age. We cook our own meals, bring left overs to lunch, and don't need cable. (only internet!) We eat out maybe once a month if that, and go to the movies maybe once every three months. The only large-ish purchases of the year are birthdays, christmas/holidays, and car repairs and upkeep. We expect to continue this trend at our new place.


We want to move soon, but the standard of living here is kind of high compared to where we were, and to be closer to work we will most likely have ~$1800 of expenses per month between rent, utilities, groceries, and (less) gas. 


The plan is just to take it one month at a time but the numbers seem very intimidating and I can't fathom paying this off in 10 years if my expenses increase if we ever have kids or want to buy a house, etc. So any tips would be great!

personalfinance,Pennsylvanians with a Traditional 401k: Your contributions are taxed by the state. Your distributions upon retirement age are not.,"All,

Just wanted to let all residents of Pennsylvania be aware of a weird state tax law. Unlike the federal government and most other states (possibly all), Pennsylvania treats 401k, 403b, and SIMPLE plans differently. Contributions to your traditional 401k are taxed in the year you make the contribution, but will not be taxed when you begin to take distributions at age of retirement. This means that at the state-level, your traditional 401k works like a Roth. [Here's the PA Department of Revenue's Q&amp;A on the topic.](https://revenue-pa.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/273/~/are-my-contributions-to-a-401\(k\)-plan-excluded-from-employer-withholding%3F) This could be particularly annoying if you dream of retiring in another state that does tax 401k distributions. 

The 401k contributions are still pre-tax at the federal level, however. The distributions will be taxed upon withdrawal. 

For those interested to see if your state has any similar type of tax law, [the Bogleheads website outlines specific state strategies that might not be in line with conventional /r/pf recommendations.](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/State_income_taxes#Specific_states)",finance,1450730546

I had this amount in my fall quarter as well but I just fronted the money myself. I could do that again but I would be out of money in my savings and I hope to keep that just for emergency purposes and it would still leave my spring quarter balance payment a mystery.

I have maxed out my sub/ubsub loans for the year so my options are the parent plus loan or a private loan. The amount I am looking to borrow is about $1800(for winter and spring quarter). 

Parent Plus loan has a 6.84% interest rate and apparently a 4% loan fee.

The private loan I'm looking at is wells Fargo which has a 3%-8% variable rate or a 6-10% fixed rate.

Both have a 6 month grace period after I graduate so I am not worried about that. My parents live basically paycheck to paycheck so they cannot help me out but they have good credit so getting approved should not be a problem.

I have those two loan options or I could just front the money (which would leave me with minimal savings) and work during winter quarter and hopefully make enough to pay a majority of my spring quarter remaining balance.

personalfinance,Should I get personal loan to settle student loan debt currently in collections?,"I owe $54k to Goldentree - I'm dealing with the loan servicer. These were unpaid private student loans. I also have a chunk of $ I owe in federal loans but I'm trying to handle this amount that is in collections since it is hurting my credit. 


 I have been aggressively paying. I've paid $500 per month for a year trying to establish some kind of trust for the lender. I was told they might  take a % off to settle if I establish a willingness to pay. So the servicer says they'll go down to $40k to settle.  (It's 30% off And the guy on the phone didn't seem to want to bring my case to the lender. He just told me the ready-made price without considering my awesome consistency like I thought he would. I thought he'd say let me contact them and get back to you but he said this lender is aggressive and 30% is a good deal. Kind of made me think why did I make all those damn payments then....) 


So the original plan was to get a personal loan so that this huge amount in collections stops dinging my credit each month. I've never gotten a personal loan and I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle if the payments will be more than I can afford. I'd be paying off a new loan instead of paying a collections agency, which I guess is better? Initial research had me worried because people are saying that banks won't give personal loans for that big of an amount or if I have bad credit, which I do. And I'm not sure if there's any leniency toward student loans versus credit card debt or whatever. Or if they even consider the type of loan this late in the game - like collections is collections whether it's student loans or whatever it is. 



I can't pay more than $500/ month, don't own a house, own a car that's almost paid off (Corolla), no dependents,  I have a reliable income, I've been a member of Citibank for many years with no bad history there, and my credit score is 673 according to quizzle. 


Is a personal loan a good idea to fix my credit? Will payments be crazy? Should I go to my home bank or some website? Should I just stick with paying the collections people more? Advice please!",finance,1450744202
personalfinance,"I graduated college 2 years ago and still have $105k in student loans. Feel betrayed by the USA mantra that ""college is necessary"". I am being charged 7% through federal loans. What can I do?","I attended an expensive private college and am left with $105k in student loan debt after two years of paying down.

Here's what infuriates me: I am being charged $7350 this year in INTEREST ONLY because the rate is 7%. For a country that claims to *value* and *invest* in education, this is way too high of a rate. I did attend a expensive private school, but coming from a family of high school graduates, I relied heavily on my high school guidance counselor's advice. He told me that attending a private university for $50k a year would be better for my future than an in-state school for $20k a year because of the school's *reputation*. 

Current financial situation: I luckily earn $60k a year now. After taxes I make $40k. After expenses, I have $15k leftover to put towards the loans. I have perfect credit and have held my job for 1.5 years.

How can I get this rate lowered? I am currently borrowing $25k in my own name as a federal loan, and $80k under my mom's name as a parent plus federal loan. Does anyone have success of refinancing for less? Would you go to a credit union or an established bank? Or is federal as good as it gets and this is just what I am doomed to pay over the next 10 years? I had dreams of building wealth through passive income, but it barely seems like a possibility anymore.

dogecoin,How to Get the Value of Dogecoin to Skyrocket!,"Basically, I think that the volume of Reddit followers to this topic of the Dogecoin should be enough to effectively kickstart my idea here... It's really quite simple and full of the ""wow"" element, so here it is:

Let's say that the average person has $300 of discretionary income per month that they can spend any way they like. Okay, so instead of just blowing the whole $300, they use $150 of it to buy Dogecoins. Then (and this is important), they spend $75 of that $150 any way they can figure out a way to spend it - and - they save the rest of it. 

Essentially, everybody has both a regular savings' plan of Dogecoins and also a regular spending plan, which is pretty much the same principal applied to otherwise ""real world"" money. As an analogy, the quote goes something like this (and I didn't make this one up): ""The value of money is in its scarcity.""

Okay, so with the ideal of ""scarcity"" being the keyword, the reason regular money is often as valuable as it is (notwithstanding things like war and bank failures that can bring down a currency's value) is because enough people who get money don't simply spend all of it. ""The rich get richer,"" and so forth, meaning that a lot of people hoard way more money than they can ever spend in a lifetime. 

By the same token, if in fact everybody simply spent every cent they ever had, then that would lead to a depreciation in the value of the currency due to the simple economic fact of supply and demand where there is ""too much liquidity"" in the everyday currency supply.

The way that governments will work to ""fix"" the problem of too much liquidity in an example like this is to create inflationary pressures, such as with raising interest rates, so that even when people do spend every dime they have, it still isn't enough to maintain their standard of living over the long term. But in this case, while there is less actual liquidity in the daily money supply, the rich are actually getting much, much richer because all the average people are spending every cent as fast as they can get it to pay for things like rent (going to their rich landlords), as well as food and commodity producers. 

There are converse examples of countries like Japan and Russia in past instances where savings rates tend to be extremely high, let's say, comparative to savings' rates in the United States; and this presents the converse problem of ""not enough liquidity,"" which mostly equates to a case for which people can't really seem to win over the long haul no matter what they do. The point to this converse problem, though, is that Russia and Japan (with Russia particularly) have been known to periodically cause a forced collapse of the value of their respective currencies enough to force people to spend all that wonderful money they had the privilege of being able to save up over the past 10 to 15 years or so when wages were outpacing inflationary pressures. 

All of this manipulation of currency values tends to redistribute the money supply, but in the end the rich always tend to get richer while the poor always tend to get poorer. Anyway, this particular problem of a society of people actually saving too much money for the good of a given currency's health is really not an issue in the United States, since the average person has very little savings in this country, while the vast sum of saved wealth is in the hands of roughly only 2% of the entire population.

Back to simple math and economic principles, though, there really isn't enough sort of ""quantum momentum"" in the equation of savings versus spending of the Dogecoin for it to end up being propelled into an extremely high-value currency position. Like I say, though, the way this could be changed easily enough is if people were willing to spend and save equal parts of the Dogecoins that they take into their possession, just like people can also do with real money.

That's really all there is to this economic determination: If everybody spends and saves Dogecoins in equal parts (e.g., halving $300 per month in allocated real-money income, for instance) then I promise you the value of the Dogecoin will have a very good chance of hitting upwards of $1.00 per coin within a relatively short span, or probably about 5 years' time.",cryptocurrency,1450777529

investing,Please help me understand defined maturity bond ETFs,"I am looking at purchasing some Guggenheim Bulletshares using their High Yield Corporate defined maturity products, as I anticipate a need for cash in the shorter term, and don't want to be in bond ETFs over the next few years in a rising rate environment in order to protect my principal.  

http://guggenheiminvestments.com/products/etf/bulletshares

For those unaware, these are ETFs which hold an actual bond portfolio which matures on or around Dec of the year in the ETF name.  You are entitled to the distributions, and also absorb any defaults of the underlying portfolio.  It trades on the market (it's an ETF), but as the bonds mature, the fund manager holds the cash (does not reinvest in new bonds).  Then in Dec, you get a final distribution which is the value of all the cash from the bonds reaching maturity.  

So in my mind, when an investor anticipates a need for cash at a defined future date, these funds are a good vehicle for being in bonds in a rising rate environment.  It has the benefit of owning an individual bond vs a bond fund (reasonable expectation of receiving back the original principal at a defined date).

What I don't understand is how to find out what the final payout will be.  Will it be NAV?  This doesn't make sense to me, because the NAV changes with market demand and has interest rate risk, but in theory, the bonds in these defined maturity portfolios should mature at their original principal value.  So in my mind, the final distribution should be the original purchase price of all the bonds, minus whatever percent defaulted.  

I can't seem to find information anywhere on what the ""original value"" of all the bonds were at inception.  It's not listed anywhere on Guggenheim's site, that I can find.  Conversely, the iShares versions of these products have an easy to remember ""base value"": $20 a share is what all their funds started as.  So one can easily calculate what their final payout might be assuming various default percentages (ie, 5% default = $19 final payout).

Is there an equivalent for the Bulletshares?  Again, I understand that the NAV is what I can buy/sell for today at current supply/demand, but I want to better understand what the values might be at maturity.

personalfinance,Need help fixing my mortgage mess. [US],"Throwaway because I'm embarrassed that I let this happen.

I purchased a house about 9 months ago for $50k. My parents are very wealthy and paid for it in cash and would cover the renovations to make it my dream home, with the understanding that I would pay them back with a mortgage. My dad said that he had found a lender to ""take care of it"" and I believed him. He told me that worst case scenario, if the house cost me more than 80% of the appraisal, I would have to pay PMI (minus the difference of the cash I had saved up).

I didn't have much interest in personal finance until then. My job was stable, but 401k matching hadn't kicked in yet (have to be here for a year), so I just kinda lived comfortably, growing my bank account (didn't even have a savings account, just let it sit there). I started getting interested and I'm now investing 5% into my 401k, full investment into a Roth IRA, and have a dedicated savings account. I also use Mint to track my budget, and am very pleased with how I'm doing. My credit score is around 760 depending on who you ask.

I never thought twice about the mortgage. I only cared that we locked in the 4.125% rate and that I could budget easily for the monthly payment.

Keep in mind I was renovating what I intend to be my ""forever"" house, with a full rewire/replumb, new kitchen, even floorplan changes to add a bathroom. Total cost for house and renovations: $126k. Lowest appraisal (apparently there are two values, and the lender looks at the lowest): $131k. I wasn't upset with this because I wasn't looking to profit.

Until I found out that what my dad had ""banked on"" was an FHA cash out refinance. Despite knowing the name of this type of refinance, he didn't realize that the max Loan to Value was 80%. So there is absolutely no chance of even paying PMI and getting a loan to cover what I owe. He is a multi-millionaire and just said ""Oops, I guess you'll need to get a second mortgage then.""

All of my savings are unfortunately allocated (state and federal taxes, insurance, and closing costs for the loans). I definitely didn't save enough. I realize that now. It's too late to change that.

My dad wants me to either get a 100% LTV second mortgage (which is hard to find and comes with high interest rates) or a 60 term personal loan (which is easy to get and comes with even higher interest rates) so that I can pay him back immediately ""because [he] really wants to use that money towards his new house."" On the day we found out the bad news, I explained that I was very disappointed because I felt I had been misled and that I was now unable to meet some lifetime goals that I had for myself for the next few years. He said that he did his best, but it was time to pay up.

I don't know much about mortgages or loans. Are there other ways to get around this? Or are my only two options a second mortgage or a personal loan?

Edit: Because I'm still embarrassed, I thought I'd mention that a few years back my sister utilized him for a similar situation and also borrowed the exact amount she would received from that $8000 tax credit from a while back in order to go towards her downpayment. He helped renovate, finance, etc and everything went through perfectly - absolutely no issues. He also owns multiple homes, and while he doesn't finance real estate anymore, he had in the past (which is why he thought a 100% LTV cash out refinance was possible, because they were back in the day).",finance,1450804198
personalfinance,"25(m) changed job and passed from $10,000 in 2014 to $100,000 in 2015. Need advice!","I posted this as my first Reddit post ever in Moronic Monday but they suggested me to make a separate thread so here we go:  

25(m), living in Poland – not Polish though – and 2015 has changed my life. At the end of 2014 I left my $10,000 a year job and got hired in a hardcore sales one. I’ve done really well this year earning around $130k (gross) thanks mostly to my commissions as my base salary is only $12,000. After taxes, social security, accountant, etc I was left with about $100,000 net to me (employer had me opening my own company and invoicing him, but that's fine).  

To put it in perspective, the average yearly salary in Poland for 2015 was a bit less than $10,000. So I made like 10x the average, which is really awesome. But I’m really not used to having money, I’ve always lived paycheck to paycheck and it’s really stressing me to have money and I feel I’m on a very important moment in my life and I should learn how to take care of this money, save, invest and secure my financial future.  

On the last two weeks I’ve been reading non-stop this subreddit, watching the recommended videos on investing, and I’m purchasing a couple of books from the list as well to read during the holidays. But I have some questions that are bothering me and I’d love some advice from you:  

1. My income is really unstable. In January, February, April, June &amp; July I got 0 commissions, so I only earned $1000. But then in November for example, I got $50,000. So: how can I make a good budget and predict well 2016?  

2. I’ve made an emergency fund of $20k into 3 accounts - $10k for rent, utilities, groceries, etc in a common account with my SO. $5k in my companies account to cover social security, accountant, phone bill, and the 19% tax on my base salary ($2k). And $5k for my personal expenses, transport, some flights, etc. So those $20k cover all the expenses I can predict for 2016. Do you think is a good setup?  

3. I bought $8,5k in virtual currencies, as I really believe in them. I got 22 BTC and 95 LTC, and right now they are worth about $10k, although I consider this a long-term investment.  

4. My bank offers me a very good interest rate on the savings account of 2,4% yearly, paid monthly. I’ve put around $12,5k there. If I reach over $25k they’ll increase the % to 2,6. Is this a good enough rate to put all my money there? I’m reading in many places/advices that you should aim returns of 10% yearly on your investments.. so 2,6% feels like it’s not good enough?  

5. There are no 401(k) here and I can’t open an IRA retirement account because I don’t know if I’ll retire here.. probably not. Can I open this type of accounts in my home country even though I’m not a fiscal resident there?  

6. I want to invest in stocks or funds, and my bank offers an online broker that looks very good. But I can only invest in Polish stock market and Polish funds. The political situation is bad right now and the market is not doing great, so probably not a good idea. Also the funds I’m seeing are all with high management fees.. anyone in Europe can recommend me something similar to this Vanguard everyone talks about? I can’t seem to find index funds with low fees and stable returns here. I’d like to invest my last $20k saved in those options to try and get higher returns.  

2016 seems will be good though, as with the sales I’ve done already I’m guaranteed around $50k, although $15k of those are in November so a long time still to earn those.. Appreciate any feedback, comments, advice, etc. It’s a totally new situation for me and I want to use it good! Thank you in advance.",finance,1450805923

I want to account for this deduction now rather than receive a refund in 2017, so my understanding is I should figure out what my tax burden should be with the IRA deduction and proper allowances (2 Federal, 1 State) and without the deduction, then keep adding allowances until I'm taxed below what I would be with the deduction and add additional withholding to make up the difference. I used paycheck-city.com to calculate everything, and arrived at the conclusion I'd need 5 federal allowances and 12 state exemptions, with an additional $7.11 withheld federally and $0.77 additional state. Does that sound correct? Or am I approaching this all wrong?

I have been tracking Brazil and it just seems to continue to slip lower and lower with no bottom in sight.

Some notable developments:  

* Finance minister sacked. New finance minister does not seem to be liked; Brazil equities went down and Real further weakened    

  
* Commodities are in a STRONG downtrend with no bottom in sight  
  
* Dollar should get a boost from Fed tightening cycle    
  
* Brazil was downgraded to junk status by both Moodys and S&amp;P    
  
* Biggest scandal in history of Brazil involving Petrobras still uncovering big politicians including heads of all political parties of current government!    
  
* Impeachment proceedings against President which is likely to drag for months if not years further making reforms/economic recovery more difficult.    
  

So what's your take? Is this the worst it'll get for Brazil? How low is low? I own a small stake in Brazil equities and this is just getting ridiculous, honestly.

personalfinance,Any advice on my student loan situation would be tremendously appreciated!,"Hi all,


I am in a pretty terrible situation with my student loans. I know I made a bad decision when deciding to go to a private university (American University) in an expensive city (Washington, DC) away from home, and if I could do it all over again I absolutely would have made a better decision, but this is what I am stuck with now so I would like to handle it as well as I possibly can. A little background on me - I am the first in my immediate family to have gone to college (so neither myself nor my parents really knew what I was getting myself into). I always naively assumed that when I got a degree I would be able to do anything and paying it off would be fine. My university gave me an aid package that paid for half of my tuition, so at the time I thought it was a steal (ha!)... they gradually decreased my financial aid package as I progressed through school and I also took a semester off and was still able to graduate on time (so I really only paid/am paying for 7 semesters worth of school). I graduated in May 2012 and majored in International Relations. I worked in that field and lived in DC for one year after I graduated, but paying my loans and living in DC became almost impossible on my salary, so I moved home. I am now in a completely different field and am working on getting my MBA part time at a public university and am attempting to pay for tuition out of pocket. My loans are described below and any insight that anyone could provide would be amazing. I am a little overwhelmed and I get a stomachache every time I look at my loans:

**Campus Partners** loan in my name -  
Original Loan Amount - $7,500  
Current Balance - $5,883.38  
Interest Rate - 5.0%  
Monthly Payment - Currently 0 because I am not paying this while in school, but normally $80.00  
Notes - Not currently paying this while in school  

**American Education Services** private loan in my name -  
Original Loan Amount - $22,920  
Current Balance - $30,591.20  
Interest Rate - 9.25%  
Monthly Payment - $301.71  
Notes - Currently paying this regularly  

**Great Lakes Student Loan** Federal loan in my name -  
Original Loan Amount - $41,750.33  
Current Balance - $43,984.89  
Interest Rate - As this is a group of loans taken out while I was in school, the interest rates vary between 3.4% and 6.8%, but most of them are 6.8%  
Monthly Payment - Currently 0 because I am not paying this while in school, but they are normally $115.03 because I was on the income based repayment plan.  
Notes - Currently paying this regularly  

**Navient private** loan in my mom's name -  
Original Loan Amount - $17,000  
Current Balance - $21,847.46  
Interest Rate - 8.25%  
Monthly Payment - $152.01  
Notes - Currently on a graduated repayment plan. I know these are terrible, but I literally cannot make the payments without it. My mom is currently paying this while I'm back in school (HUGE help, and I am so grateful)  

**FedLoan Servicing** federal PLUS loan in my mom's name -  
Original Loan Amount - $10,000  
Current Balance - $8,928.08  
Interest Rate - 7.9%  
Monthly Payment - $138.71  
Notes - My mom is currently paying this while I am back in school.  

Here is the details of what I currently make:  
I make about **$2,726.76 a month**  
My current monthly bills/payments -  
$600 rent  
$176 cell phone (I pay for my dad's cell phone as well to help him out)  
$301.71 to American Education Services  
$121.00 for my monthly train pass  
$400/500 for food/misc expenses  
I have been trying to put $1,200/month min. towards school payments but I put anything that's left there.  

I guess the tl;dr of this would be what should I do? Where would be the best decision to put my money? Should I continue paying for school or should I keep paying my loans down? It doesn't make sense to me because then I would just be taking out more loans in spite of myself. I really have no idea what to do, but I think getting a graduate school education is really my only choice right now so that I can get a higher paying job so that I am not completely drowning forever. I am sure a lot of you probably want to go back in time to 18 year old me and slap me upside the head for doing something so stupid and if you have a time machine I would be glad to join you.
Any help would be so appreciated. Please let me know if you have any other questions that would be of assistance.  

I am so grateful!

technology,A rather bland and generic response I received from Senator Warner (D-Va) explaining why he voted in favor of CISA.,"Dear &lt;scumbag&gt;,

          Thank you for contacting me regarding S. 754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015. I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue. 

          This bill aims to improve cybersecurity by encouraging private companies and the government to voluntarily share information about threats, while protecting privacy and civil liberties.  On October 27, I voted for and the Senate passed this bill by a bipartisan vote of 74-21. In April, the House passed two similar cybersecurity measures: H.R. 1560, the Protecting Cyber Networks Act, and H.R. 1731, National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015.  The House and Senate versions will now head to conference to agree on the final legislative language.

          Cyber-attacks are among the most critical threats our nation faces, jeopardizing both our national and economic security. Estimates indicate that cyberattacks and cybercrime account for between $24 and as much as $120 billion in economic and intellectual property loss per year in the U.S.  Furthermore, cyberattacks against the nation's critical infrastructure have the potential to cause significant disruptions, and even deaths.  The recent cyber-attack at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that compromised the personal information of at least 22 million individuals demonstrated the impact of this threat on Americans. As we have seen with attacks on Target, Neiman Marcus, Home Depot, banks like JPMorgan, and others, this problem is not limited to the government. Encouraging increased coordination and information sharing between companies and government is critical to better identify and protect against threats and is a good first step towards protecting our nation.

          I was very pleased that this legislation included two provisions I championed to strengthen the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) authorities to protect civilian networks and to conduct threat assessments of critical cyber infrastructure affecting public health, the economy, or national security.  The Federal Information Security Management Reform (FISMA Reform) Act of 2015, which was included in CISA, will bolster DHS's ability to protect federal civilian (.gov) networks.  The second provision requires DHS to assess whether the government receives adequate information from those critical infrastructure entities whose failure in the aftermath of a cyber-attack would cause severe damage to national security capabilities. 

          As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I will continue to monitor cybersecurity issues as they develop and to look for further opportunities to strengthen our cybersecurity capabilities, while protecting privacy and civil liberties.

          Again, thank you for contacting me. For further information or to sign up for my newsletter please visit my website at http://www.warner.senate.gov.",technology,1450822938

I'm looking for ways to lower my monthly mortgage and refinancing seems like a viable options.

While I have not had any recent property assessment, I'm reasonably confidence that my property assessment is more than $310K. Regardless, the current principal balance is $272K

I've been reading a few posts on Reddit as well as a few articles online. I'm thinking that a refinance at lower interest without cash out and without reverting back to 30 years loan is the best options.

It is also worth mentioning that I have very poor credit and about three nearly maxed out credit -- hence my motivation to lower my mortgage so that I can afford to focus on my debts burden..

personalfinance,"[Housing] Is it better to buy a home cash, or mortgage it anyway?","Let's say you were interested in a house worth roughly 20% of your net worth. You're worth 1m cash and the house is worth about 200k. You want to have your assets poised for maximum growth - do you drop 200k on the house straight up, or do you put 20% down and put it on a 10 year mortgage? Or do you put X% down where X is however much it takes to be able to afford the mortgage payment if all your cash vanishes in a bad investment.

The main benefits I see to buying it cash are the fact that cash offers are generally preferred by sellers, combined with the fact that if your other investments go south you're in no danger of losing the home. In theory however you should be able to get a better ROI by mortgaging the home, as the appeciation in the house's value combined with getting better returns on your investment than your mortgage interest rate. Approval should also be more or less a non-issue.",finance,1450833260

Is it worth necessarily taking on such a huge debt (let alone finding an agency willing to loan so much for a low interest rate) just so I can get a homefield advantage? Or am I better off staying in Canada and studying in one of the (oversaturated) schools here such as Waterloo or UofT? 

My parents are willing to pay down the same amount that I already cost to them right now (around 30ish k or so CAD), with the rest coming out of loans that I take out in my name. Should I just give up my US undergrad hopes and just try the US for grad school?

Now I am not wanting my car anymore as it's become a burden. The amount I owe on the car is higher than when I originally started paying. It's 13,700$ that I owe. I got an instant offer of 8,600$, but that would mean I still owe 5,000$ or so, with 15% interest, right?

I really want to refinance just to get a lower interest rate because I didn't realize how bad I was being screwed. But I am curious as to what would be the best possible way to go about this. If I refinance should I just keep the car? The insurance and car payments are burdensome and I'd love to just have the extra money at the end of the month.

I am currently contributing towards my works 401k (4%) and my employer contributes 6%

I am also contributing towards a 457B plan (4%) with my employer also matching that amount.

I also have a mortgage of $130,000 left on a $203,000 home (Florida) @ interest rate of 3.8.

Here is my question, the 401k and 457b contributions are not going to change, but should i focus more on extra mortgage payments on my mortgage principal to pay that off early over contributions to my roth ira? Or the otherway round?

I know some people in here are alot more clued up on what would be better to do in my situation, so I would really appreciate the input from you guys.

This is really my first opportunity in a very long time to start paying these debts off in a timely manner and I'm making a promise to myself to not screw this up. I've played around with the numbers a bit and if I stay true, I can have just about everything paid off in two years. 

If I use the transfer option I realize that my credit utilization is going to shoot up a bit. I'm currently at around 16%. 
I realize this would simply be moving the debt around but ultimately does it make sense to pay the loan off first and free up that payment to be applied elsewhere?

I forgot to add the possibility of paying off the student loans first. Since that does (at this point) have the highest interest rate.

personalfinance,"Should I Focus More on Student Loan Debt, Retirement, or Investing?","I'm 33.  I graduated in 2006 with $80,000 in federal/private student loan debt.  Despite working menial jobs until about 5 years ago when I started my career, I've never been late or deferred payments.  I put an extra $75/month toward the loans and the current balance is about $55,500.  Interest rates on the loans vary from 2.75% to 4.25%.

My husband and I make a combined income of about $113,000/year.  We have a young daughter in daycare which costs about $1200/month (we expect to have another child within a year), and our mortgage is $1100/month.  We both drive old cars that are paid for and have no credit card debt.

I started saving for retirement as soon as I started working, but it was menial savings on a $35k/year salary.  My husband didn't start saving for retirement until we got married 4 years ago.  We each currently put 8% of our income into retirement, which is matched 5% by our employers.  Our combined retirement accounts right now are only at about $35k.  I should be able to count on a modest $500/month (today's dollars) pension in addition to SS and retirement savings.

We used to save about $450/month each month, but now that our savings account has a balance that could last us for 6 months if we both somehow got fired on the same day, I'd like to use that money elsewhere.  Would you advise paying down my student loan debt first, upping our retirement contribution, or start to invest it?  We know nothing about investing at this point in our lives.

financialindependence,Personal Capital and interest rate assumptions?,"I love Personal Capital for its user interface and various tools, including the ""Retirement Planner"". The weird thing was, when I punched in what I thought were fairly conservative numbers for a potential early retirement in 2022, the projected portfolio value showed the portfolio depleting to nothing by the age of 70 or so in greater than 50% of scenarios.

Whaaaaa? That doesn't look right. The whole idea of withdrawing less than the average yearly investment returns is so the base portfolio value stays roughly flat or even grows with time. I played around with it a bit and found that two of the default assumptions were an inflation rate of 4% and a tax rate on withdrawals of 20%.

Looking at how withdrawals are taxed (planning on withdrawing less than $40k per year), I would expect a tax rate of more like 12%. I also checked out historical inflation rates and you'd have to go back to 1990 to see average inflation rates of 4% (http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/historical-inflation-rates/).

So, what's the deal? Are my tax calculations off, is there any reason we should be expecting inflation to increase from current levels in the immediate future, or are these assumptions just overly conservative?

personalfinance,"Would it be best for me to try a balance transfer, or call and ask for a lower interest rate?","I'm so torn on which path I should take here. I have accrued about $4500 in credit card debt over the last year between two credit cards, and I'm starting to drown in the payments. Both cards have a high interest rate:

* Card 1 is a Chase Freedom card at 22.99% (had since early 2012)
* Card 2 is through Capital One at 24.90% (had since summer 2014)

On CK I saw an offer for a card through Chase to transfer my balance to with 0% intro APR for 15 months, and a rate of 12.99% - 22.99% after that with ""very good"" approval odds according to CK, for whatever that's worth.

I believe I have decent credit, but not great (CK score of 728).

With all of this in mind, which would be the better option between calling each of my card companies and asking for a lower interest rate, or attempting a new card offer like the one above to transfer my balances to?

personalfinance,Have about $50k. Pay student loans of ~$35k or purchase house before I am priced out?,"Currently I have about $50k in savings, mostly recently received from an inheritance, but some from savings. I am totally debt free aside from ~$35k in student loan debt, all government provided, no private loans.  I make about $40k/year but am likely to have a raise/promotion to about $45-50k by mid next year (2016).


I am conflicted on what to do about paying off my loans as I also want to purchase my fist home very soon. For reference I live in a “boom” city where housing prices are skyrocketing and do not look to be dropping or even leveling out any time soon. I can still purchase a decent home for about $200k in a half decent neighborhood that will likely become very desirable neighborhood in about five years from now.  If current trends remain a $200k home will be worth two to three times as much in 5-7 years. I am not looking to flip it though. I just don’t want to be priced out of the market completely as I am afraid I will be within a couple of years.  I am located in Austin, Texas so I do not expect a downturn or bubble popping as three of the top tech companies (Apple, Oracle, Amazon) are building large offices to employs thousands within about 6 miles of the neighborhood I am looking at.


I would likely have a roommate for the first couple of years of having the mortgage that I would charge around $600/month for rent, which would significantly decrease the economic burden. 
Which would make more sense, Pay the entire loan, pay most of the loan leaving around $10k left af a low interest rate ~3%, or dump most into the down payment of a house and just keep making monthly payments on my student loans (around $300)?

personalfinance,PSA: Paying off Nelnet Earlier with Varying Loan Rates,"For 3+ years I've been putting extra on my auto payment for my federal student loans, administered by Nelnet. After just speaking with them on the phone I realized the extra money was only going towards advancing my due date. Ideally, you'd pay the extra towards the principle of the highest interest loan. I have loans varying from 3.15% to 6.55% - the overpayment has been applied across them equally, which is obviously suboptimal.

So, if attempting to pay more than your minimum payment, and to get it right you need to do the following: set your autopayments to the minimum Then, choose ""pay by group"" and apply the overpayment to your highest interest loan(s) of your choice. You must do it manually every month, but to me it seems worth it considering the difference in the interest.

personalfinance,Question about paying down mortgage vs holding cash,"I think I know the answer to this, but I am looking for verification from some of you as well as a few opinions and insights that may have been missed

About four months ago, I stopped investing into my taxable account and turned off DRIP to see what the market will do over the next 6-12 months. This decision was chosen for two reasons: (a) start purchasing again if the market drops or (b) put money down into a new residence. I currently own a condominium that will probably hit the market in the next 12 months, so I would like a cash buffer there in case a townhome or free standing unit is found that I **really** like. 

I have a decent brick of cash that has been accruing over the past four months and my year end bonus is about to be paid out. Given my scenario, is it more advantageous to hold the cash for flexibility, or to pay down my mortgage to save on paid interest as well as parking cash in the home when it comes time to sell and roll over into the new home?

Just FYI, my mortgage is currently a 30 year at 4%. I just completed an LTV re-financed last January at about 75% because Texas has a law where condominiums are subject to an interest rate adjustment above 75% LTV. Current mortgage balance is $243k vs a conservative market value of $340k. I was looking to LTV re-fi again but am opting not to since I will most likely purchase a new residence in the next 12 months.

personalfinance,Figuring out our financial direction for 2016,"Hi everyone and anyone, I'm hoping someone might be able to give me some direction in our financial decisions.

**Income:**
- Me: $42k
- My wife: $45k (raise to $60k scheduled October 2016), benefits, union membership and job security

Savings rate for 2015 = 25% of income

**Assets:**
- $32,500 in a brokerage account invested in Putnam Growth and Income A (PGRWX - http://www.morningstar.com/funds/XNAS/PGRWX/quote.html) 

- $5,500 in savings bonds.

- VALIC 457(3b) = $6,000 (in my wife's name)

- Roth IRA (Vaguard Target Retirement 2055 Fund) = $11,000 (in my name)

- Wife's Pension

- Saving's Account = $21,000, 1% interest rate @ Barclay's

**Debts:**
My wife has about $150k in student loans.  Half of this is Federal loans which will be largely forgiven after 112 more income based payments.  We file taxes separately in order to keep this payment lower.  The other half is private loans with interest rates of 5.12% to 5.25%.  

Besides this we don't have any debt.  

**Our financial goals are:**

- Save for a down payment on a house.  In the town we live in (and want to stay in) we will need to spend at least $300,000 to get a decent 3 BR house, if not $350,000.  Since having a 20% down payment is ideal we will need $60-70k.  We probably wouldn't be ready for this for at least 3 years.  

- Save for future children's education.  We would like to have 2 to 4 children and we intend for them to go to a particular private school (based on religious and educational beliefs).  On average this will probably cost $10,000+ per child per year, although the school is supposed to be flexible in working with families to make tuition affordable, especially with families with multiple children in their schools.  We would really not be happy about limiting the number of children due to finances!  We do not have any children yet but my wife is pregnant and due in July!

- Retirement of course.  

**Questions:**

- The brokerage account is something that was set up by an elderly relative when I was young.  Looking at the fund it doesn't seem so good, with a high expense ratio.  I am wondering if I should move it into a more aggressive fund.  However if we are saving for a house down payment it might not make sense to put it in something with higher risk.  So it might make more sense to keep it where it is or put into another conservative fund such as VASIX - (https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0723&amp;FundIntExt=INT#tab=0), which seems like a better fund due to lower expense ratios. Another thing I wonder is if we were to keep it in a low risk fund, would it not make sense to instead use it to pay off a large chunk of my wife's private student loans? The interest on those are a bit over 5%, which is probably what these low risk funds will earn anyways.  Paying off the loans would be a guaranteed ""return"" of that 5%.  Is this a sensible choice? Which of those two is the better option?  

- Is it too risky to hold savings for a house down payment in a conservative, low risk fund?  CDs are not very good right now, and I know some people would say to keep this money in a savings account or CD but it doesn't seem like the risk of a low risk fund is enough that it would cancel out the benefits.  

- From what I understand having $20k in our savings as an emergency fund is a good number, so should we take everything we save after that and put it into either low risk or more aggressive investments?  Or should we just use more savings to aggressively pay off a bigger chunk of my wife's loans each month?

- What would be a good short to intermediate strategy to help for our plans for our kid's educations?  

- What is the advantage to using our VALIC 457(3b) as opposed to opening up another Roth IRA? Would it make sense to stop contributing to the 457(3b) and instead set up an IRA under my wife's name?

personalfinance,Credit card question - tangled series of events,"I have an ordinary credit card from BoFA, and I'm in kind of a pickle. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Information on a need-to-know basis:
-My statements end/start on the 6th of every month.
-My interest rate is 12.99%. However, I was on a promotional 0% interest period that ended 12/6, which may further complicate things.

I've always paid my balance off in full every month for the 1.5 years I've had the credit card. However, in late November, things became messy. I made a big purchase of $2500, at the end of November. It was an impulse purchase, and I cancelled the order, but the purchase had already went through. It returned back on my credit card on 12/7 as a full refund, only one day after the previous month's statement closed. I also made another purchase and had it refunded, although it looks like the refund showed up on the statement, so I shouldn't have to worry about that.

Due to this large purchase, my ""statement balance"" is ~$3200, even though I had a current balance of ~$1900, which I just paid off today. It has not yet reflected the $1900 payment, which would bring my current balance to $0, in plenty of time for 1/6/2016. Looking at the list of items (purchases/credits), the beginning balance was ~$3200, reflecting the ""statement balance"", but gradually went down to ~$1900, which should be $0 in several business days, based on today's payment.

When calling BoFA twice, I got two conflicting answers. One said that as long as I paid the $1900, I would pay $0 interest and owe nothing in January. The other said that I still owed on the original beginning-of-December balance of ~$3200, and that the $2500 would be subtracted from it, leaving me with a ~$800 balance to pay, in addition to the current balance I had (~$1900). 

I paid ~$1000 towards the last month's balance, only because I knew I'd cancel the $2500 purchase, and based my payment on that.

I am very, very confused. Apparently, I am bad at math and at this whole thing. Looking further back, it looks like the ~$3200 includes the beginning-of-November balance that was due, but I had paid it off (not the exact amount, but more). So, I am very, very confused, and would like advice and help on how to best proceed. Should I just worry about the current balance being paid off, which it was, or...? I was told that if I paid my monthly bills/balance in full every month (which I did), then I wouldn't pay any interest.

The general thing is, if you buy an EV (electric vehicle) many qualify for a $7500 Federal tax credit.  The fine print saying it can only be applied to one tax year, and you are only ""credited"" the maximum liability you have. My personal federal taxes usually total between 3500-4000 a year.    Basically, it's like saying ""I don't make enough to qualify for the full amount of free tax money"" they are giving away.

I'd love to buy used and not have to mess with any of the tax stuff, but the likelihood of getting the car I want used is slim to none.  (2016 volt here in TX)    I'm not planning on buying till late 2016, possibly early 2017

**My Question**
Would it be possible (or even legal) to let my tax liability start to build up over the next 1 to 1.5 years? Meaning, I change the automatic federal with holdings to 0%.  File my taxes like normal, and then go onto some sort of snail paced payment plan?   After the purchase of the car, do the paperwork for the tax credit, and then $7500 worth of tax liability disappears?  After which I would put my with holdings back to the 10 or 15% level and life goes on.  

Just to be known the extra money I kept each month that *didn't* go to the govt would be put in a special car fund/tax fund account that would sit on the side in case I ever needed to pay the government what I owed them ""right now"".  Once the tax dust settles, I'd probably juts make a lump sum payment of $7500 on the car itself to fulfill the loan a few years faster. 

Seems a bit complicated but it would allow me to get the maximum benefit applied to me for buying an EV even though I don't make enough in the year to do it the normal way.  Also keep in mind I'd be putting probably 50% down on the car itself so it's not like I would be struggling to make payments or anything like that.

We would review it weekly to try to stay on track for the month but it just didn't seem to make a difference. Basically, if she wanted it, she would buy it. This was worse around Christmas time when she would have the highest expenditure of the year. I have resolved this for the last 3 years by taking the credit card from her after Christmas to try to pay off the credit card as quickly as possible. This is very effective to get our finances our of the 'red'.

This year, she has once again spent up (currently $7k on the credit card - and she's just gone shopping again and I'm afraid to look). 

A potential solution I thought of was getting her own credit card with a $3k limit, but the problem with these cards is that they don't waive the foreign transaction fee (we would get charged 3% when she makes international purchases - which happens often enough). The credit card she has doesn't get charged that fee.

I don't want to pay the foreign trx fee just to keep her from over spending but I'm thinking maybe someone else has a suggestion I haven't thought of?",finance,1450959421
personalfinance,Any reason to NOT pay off this loan?,"When I graduated I had about $70K in student loan debt with interest rates up to 9%. I aggressively paid the debt down until I was left with my lowest interest rate loan (2.92%).

I have an emergency fund and have fully funded my Roth IRA for 2015. (I am not enrolled in my employer's 401k plan; will likely do so next year.) Even if I pay off my loan in full, I will have an excess of cash that--once I get a clearer idea of my immediate savings goals--I may invest.

Is there any reason to NOT pay off my loan? It is a private loan for about $12K with an interest rate of 2.92% and an expected repayment date of November 2032.

The only nagging feeling I have is that graduate school may be on the horizon (and I assume if I took out loans again, the interest rate would be above 3%), but because I don't have any specific plans or a specific timeline I feel I'm wasting money by letting this loan sit.

Thank you for your input!",finance,1450964048
personalfinance,Seeking advice on how to combat my own recklessness,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

For no reason other than reckless spending and my own failure to keep a budget, I'm in need of some help. I'm currently buried under a rather significant amount of debt and need to devise a recovery plan. Here are some numbers:

*Liabilities*

**Credit card debt**: $11,000 at 16.24% APR

**Student loan debt**: $78,500 at varying interest rates (around 8% for the larger chunks)

**Rent and bills, per month**: $2,300


As you'll notice, my monthly rent and bills are absurdly high...on account of living in NYC. I know I should find a cheaper apartment, but that can only happen once my lease expires at the end of next summer. I moved here a few months ago for a Summer Associate position with a law firm and signed a year lease. I'm now studying for the bar exam and will begin full-time with the firm next fall at a salary of $160,000. After taxes, the take-home amount will be much lower, but I'm nevertheless aware of the extremely privileged position in which I find myself. 

Still, I'm not financially savvy and am hoping to solicit some advice on the most cost-effective way to proceed. 

While studying for the bar exam, I am working a part-time gig (around 20 hours a week at $12/hr), which should provide me with some supplemental income to use on groceries, etc. in the meantime. As soon as I'm finished with the bar exam in March, I'll hopefully get a second part-time job until I begin at the firm. I currently have about $24,000 in my checking account, the bulk of which will be used to pay rent and other bills until I start full-time at my firm. My credit card debt is purely a consequence of reckless spending and a flawed sense of financial security. I also convinced myself that, given the assurance of future income next fall, it was smarter to live off a credit card (despite building a balance) and maintain liquidity in my checking account. This was dumb, in hindsight.

I recently learned about balance transfers for credit cards and am wondering if this is the smartest way to begin eliminating the credit card debt. Do I need to just tread water for the time being and accept the fact that I can't make any meaningful dent in my amount owed until next year? 

Thanks in advance for any help.",finance,1450970307
personalfinance,How do you deal with overbearing student loans? Balancing Life and Repayment?,"To get a few things out of the way:
- I realize I took out student loans willingly
- I realize I don't have it the worst in the world

At 26, I finally have a decent salary, $45k which I think is pretty legit for someone starting in my field (government, environment, education/outreach), but I am basically paycheck to paycheck. Thanks to a previous job where I was able to save 50% of my net pay, I have a safe buffer in my accounts in case I miss a paycheck, but it's not enough to live on beyond a month. I feel like I'm stuck constantly. My net worth is basically stationary. Cost of living is very high where I live and work, and it's a landlord's market. Everyone wants a F/L/S and there is no negotiating. I'm living with ~$80k in student loans due to going to an expensive state school, feeling invincible as an 18y/o, poor guidance, lower-middle class parents who couldn't help me with college (besides co-signing) but somehow made too much money for me to qualify for free aid, and the ridiculous cost of education these days. Due to previously mentioned poor paying but profitable job, I am currently only paying on $50k of my $80k in loans (not paying the government loans). Am I going to be burdened with this for the rest of my youth? How do I mentally overcome this? It's beautiful outside, I live on a south florida island, but I am stuck inside worrying about money and trying to not spend any more of it.

tl;dr

how do you overcome the crushing weight of student loans or debt in general? Am i missing some great resource to help people with this? I have incredible credit somehow, but SoFi recently rejected my appeal to refinance half of my private student loans (which would have lowered my monthly payment AND reduced my payback time) so I'm back to square one. I am now in the top earning percentages in my area, yet I can still barely afford to live in a 1br apartment with a girlfriend, buy food, and pay my loans. Forget saving for a new car or enjoying the island life around me, thinking about home ownership, or having a dog until I'm in my mid thirties. Halp, pf.

EDIT: Working on formatting a budget here. Will get back.

EDIT: 1.) This is from YNAB and the numbers are my 3-month averages (Since that's when I moved and started this job), I've been using YNAB for almost a year at this point. I stick to it pretty well. If there are ($##) next to something, that's what I try to contribute and stick to for the month. Some of the things (like Alcohol, fishing license, junk food, household goods, and holiday) are much higher than they normally will be due to having just moved and it being the holiday season.

EDIT: 2.) I'd also appreciate advice on whether I should look into purchasing a house down here. I plan to stay in this job (if I can afford to...) for probably at least 5 years. Zillow says mortgage+total cost of ownership could put a 2br/1ba house around $1200/month. Is that even an option to be looking into that? Finding a down payment will be tough, but I'm handy, not too worried about maintenance/furnishings/etc. I just need a roof basically.

Also, should I keep making interest+ a little payments on the federal loans? That would definitely mean no chance at saving up for a down payment or anything really at this point. I think I can count on 120 payments worth of non-profit/public sector work safely, it just depends on if my IBR payment will go up.

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidating Companies,"I am helping my girlfriend consolidating her loans. She is pretty clueless when it comes to her loans. Personally never took loans, and don't have any experience with the process.

She has just been paying them without thinking of ways to save. 
Currently she has about $165k in students loans(started at $185k). These are spread between between federal and private, but are mostly federal. The interest rates are high, ranging between 6.5-7.4%

She is paying $2200 a month towards them, and that will finalize them in 10 years. This isn't a burden to either of us, because we both have high paying careers, and I have 0 debt. 

I read up on IBR. It isn't a viable option, because the debt would be paid before forgiveness, and would just cost more interest. Then I have moved on to refinancing the loans. 

I have had acquaintances have very bad experiences with this(scams, and costing more). My hope is I can get some guidance to which companies I should be looking more into. 

Thank you for you help, and time.

Loan information: WF - 49,980$ with a 6% interest rate (539.40$ payment per month for 15 years) 

Separate loan: NN - 11,265 with 7% interest rate (~125.00$ payments per month for 10 years)

Background: Just graduated from college in January but stayed off campus in a house with friends until May when I had my actual ceremony and received my degree. I Deferred my loans in July since I was working a part time job without enough income to pay for the loans when they kicked in. 

Current situation : Living in my parents house still, minimal expenses (100$ in gas per month, 200$ rent to parents) Still in deferment until February for WF loan, other loan I have been making minimum payments on. I currently have 3,000$ saved and am working a full time job I began the last week of November where I will be making approximately 40,000$ a Year before taxes. 

My question: How should I go about paying off these debts? I am leaning more towards the snowball method (read the sticky to the side) and want to completely knock out the 11,000$ loan in less than a year so I can start making higher payments on the other loan and just not have to worry about multiple payments a month.

personalfinance,Medical Student with Adverse Credit/Loan History Looking for Advice,"Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all! Very brief backstory: I am a first year medical student at a US allopathic school and during my undergraduate years I made some poor financial decisions that led to a poor credit score. Furthermore, through even poorer decision-making I defaulted on some of my undergraduate student loans, rendering me ineligible for federal financial aid/grants/loans.

I know, I know, I suck. I realized how stupid I was being and took full responsibility for my financial situation. I spent the last 8 months getting everything back on track and just recently came back into good standing with my undergraduate loans (i.e. no longer in default, everything back on schedule).

My question to /r/personalfinance is what kind of options might anyone here know of that will be open to me regarding funding my medical education? I've already discussed this with my school's financial aid department and they have assured me that since I am back in good standing with my loans I will now be eligible for federal loan assistance up to ~$21,000/semester. This takes care of about half of the money I will need for the upcoming  and future semesters. I unfortunately do not have many options when it comes to family assistance, as I come from a lower middle-class family where the most I can possibly get from them would be a cosignature (maybe; parents do not have great credit, either). Are there any avenues available to me that I may not have thought of? I have already looked into the military health professions scholarship route and will likely be pursuing that option for the following academic year (Fall '16 - Summer '17) as a career in military medicine has been something of interest to me for quite some time.

Want to buy a home! The price range of homes we like Range $280k-$330K. Started the loan process and was approved for significantly less, max $280k (he told me to look at $265k range which is a crappy home in an “okay” neighborhood)
-Reason so low: My SO had BAD credit when younger, we found out everything will drop off his credit report by March 2016 so essentially he has no credit. (loan will be completely in my name). My credit score was a 741 when they ran it. They said me being in school hurt as well because I don’t have the 2 years of work history. 


Currently in BSN program at a Cal State. Starting next September I will no longer qualify for financial assistance so anticipate a payment or need for loan. 
SO got a better Job in Feb, now makes $15/hr but we keep money separate so his savings is not included in my above total. Going from No money to some money has been weird. We have had some splurges but nothing crazy! Working full time and in school full time I tend to eat out a lot, trying to cut down on this!


Questions: 
*1)	Would paying off my debts (i.e car/credit cards) help or hurt my situation? 
*2)	Should I buckle down and put more money away with each check?
a.	D/t school this past semester I was so busy only worked minimal overtime

I didn't work for nearly 6 months after graduation and have been trying to play catch up for some time but getting myself further and further into debt. I had to sell my car and cancel my insurance because I simply couldn't afford it. I've gotten to the point where I'm paying each month to stay less in debt than I would be without paying. 

I went 6 years to a school for a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I had serious family issues in my last 3 years, basically why I didn't graduate on time. My GPA tanked a bit (although I was Dean's list for a few semester) because of the incidents that happened, but I managed to get through it. I graduated two years ago, got a starting job in the solar energy industry making $34k a year with $15k in incentives. Problem is, company was bought out a year ago, and with that my incentives went out the window. So now I've got a BS in Mechanical Engineering making $34k with about a year and change of experience. I don't want to be defaulting on my private loans, but at this point, I'm basically out of options. I need to get myself into a higher paying job as I'm intellectually capable of doing so, but I've been passed up on a promotion at work 4 times this year and it's really stung me mentally (my work ethic has declined substantially). I've gone to my boss about this once, saying how I do perform highly at my role and my role has expanded substantially to the point that my compensation is well below the market average. I've been told a couple times now saying ""He's working on it"". It's been 3 months, I'm still pulling in $500/wk basically. My loan debt is barely into the 6 figure territory, which I know I can manage if I get a proper paying job, but the debt just feels overwhelming. $4k is a ton of money to me right now and living paycheck to paycheck and still not coming out positive is really hurting other parts of my life. I don't want to have to deal with collections. I don't want to get sued in court. I want to pay this back, but I financially don't have the means to dig myself out of the hole currently. I've spoken with several representatives of the lender telling them of my situation and the only options they give me is to go into forbearance, which is counter productive to what I'm trying to do. 

I've started a game plan for the next few months:

1. Get into a higher paying job or get a salary increase (I want a minimum of $55k-$60k/yr which is more than reasonable for my degree with experience).

2. Relocate. I'm currently in a small city in upstate NY and it's incredibly depressing. There's very little in terms of growth in this area and I've noticed that living here is affecting me negatively. Even if my bills increase to move somewhere else, having a positive frame of mind will certainly help me get out of my current situation. 

My close friends want me to move to the NYC area (Brooklyn/Queens), I definitely think this is what I need to do. It eliminates the necessity of needing a car because of public transportation and the opportunity there is much greater than here. I know it's about 30-40% more expensive, but jobs pay more there to compensate for that difference.

3. Make my student loans priority number one (which it is now). I am really wanting to own my own home and be on my way to starting a family in 5 years or so (26 now). I can't possibly do that with the amount of money I'm paying towards student loans. Get rid of this shit as soon as possible. If I'm making $4k/mo and my expensive including loans total $3k/mo, I will throw an extra $800/mo towards those loans just to get it out of the way.",finance,1450987636
personalfinance,110k in loans and I want to fly,"This is my first post, hope I'm doing everything OK. I'm hoping you folks will be kind enough to give me some advice or alert me to some piece of information I'm unaware of that could help me out.

I financed school/living doing 5 years for two science majors. I worked when I could and saved what I could but pretty much had 20k a year financed via government and private PLUS. There's 30k in federal and 80k in private. Interest rates range from 3.4-7.8%. 

So minimum payment on that badboy is about 1300 with the standard plans. I've been overpaying on the few federal loans that have 6.8% interest but the private PLUS loans have me a bit worried. I was considering dropping to graduated payments or extended payments and overpaying on the 7.8% and avalanching down. I pull in about $2600 monthly after benefits and matching 401k at my work. I have $225 car payment and $30 gym bill, $100 in gas, but no rent (living with gram). I'm trying to cut down the food bill but working out 2-3 hours a day in preparation for possible marine / air force aviation has me eating a ton.

Now to me, it seems like I'm royally screwed for 10 years and that moving out into my own place is years down the line. Living with gram has put a serious dent into my sex life with my girlfriend.  I also have military aspirations now that technology can fix your eyes up 20/20 under a laser. As far as I can see, you have to give up any LRP when you go in as a commissioned officer. I do not believe I would be able to make payments while training to fly (my dream job).

btc,Implications of an centrally constrained blocksizes and other variables,"Centrally constrained here implies that individual actors have no say in the blocksize (or other variable), but a central entity (core developers in this case) limit it for whatever reason.

In a free-market, the blocksize would be determined by price discovery, i.e., the best blocksize would spontaneously arise due to the effects of game theory. The rules of the game should be set such that a near-optimal blocksize is mined most of the time. As bandwidth becomes cheaper or transactions become more numerous, the blocksize should auto-adjust.

When a variable is artificially constrained, everything else has to change to accomodate this constraint. This is the source of numerous frictions in an economic system. Artificial constraints also cause explosive events when these variables are changed or are considered to be changed regardless of any action taken. Take the example of the stock market reaction to interest rate changes. A 2% jump or fall in the market is quite expected and in pathological cases, it can be quite a bit more.

In general, artificially constraining variables is central planning intended to force a particular outcome. For example, the US government artificially constraints interest rates to stimulate a lagging economy or dampen runaway inflation. Whether this actually accomplishes anything is up for debate and is best left to a separate discussion.

The question before this community is the following: Is it best that we attempt to centrally control variables in the bitcoin economy or develop game-theoretic systems that will respond to appropriate economic pressure? My guess is given the cypherpunk/libertarian/anarchist background here, central planning is the last option for the majority.

**When common-sense regulations go wrong:** There is an outlook among regulators that *fine-grained* regulations are bad, but *common-sense* regulations are OK. A fine-grained regulation is like moving the interest rate from 1.25% to 1.5% whereas a common-sense regulation is like setting the max credit card interest rate to 100% APR because there is been no known instance of anyone paying off a loan with an interest rate greater than that. 

The original Satoshi 1MB limit was a common-sense regulation that has now become a fine-grained regulation due to simply economic expansion. This eventually happens for most regulations because the pressure to act quickly forces many people to add a numeric limit than to develop a game-theoretic constraint. A limit on the max block size to be 10 times the median blocksize of the last 1000 blocks is a common-sense regulation that is set as a self-adjusting parameter instead of an arbitrary value.

A game-theoretic way to place the regulation would be to require fees that are proportional to delivery time (similar to FedEx). If you want to be included in the current block, it costs 0.001/MB; the next block costs you 0.0001/MB, and so on. This will allow miners to set a threshold fee below which they will not include Tx in their blocks. To some extent, this is already in place. I'm no game-theory expert and am sure others will come up with far better alternatives.

Central planning using blocksize limits to achieve anti-competitive economic goals is damaging to the entire bitcoin ecosystem. 

Allegedly, the following goals are met by central planners: 
 
* Disable 0-conf 
* Disable confidence measures (a la Blockcypher) 
* Disable micropayments 
* Disable metaprotocols (such as colored coins)

Bottom line is that the above are a sign that Bitcoin is *already centralized*, with a handful of actors attempting control of the bitcoin economic ecosystem.

If every innovation is stifled by the central planners, the bitcoin ecosystem will cease to be fertile and the innovators will fork the coin or move somewhere else.",cryptocurrency,1450990819

Bitcoin,The urgent need to buy Bitcoin while you can still afford it.,"I stopped saving dollars in 2004, when interest rates for money market accounts dropped to 0.1%. Then I bought gold and silver and related equities. These did well for a while, then the equities were annihilated while gold and silver languished.

Completely cynical about the stock market, I read the Bitcoin whitepaper in early 2013 and started accumulating.

I create software. I'm fortunate that my labor is still valuable, but I know that this will probably not last. Others are being made redundant now.

People call Bitcoin a risky investment, but I think that you absolutely must buy Bitcoin now, while you still can. 

Even gold and silver will not be very valuable in the long run. They are commodities, and technology will find a way to increase supply. 

However, Bitcoin is the capital that will power the machines that make human labor redundant. As a human, you should not view Bitcoin as a risky investment, but as a life insurance policy that you absolutely must have.

This is a dark view of the future, but we live in a dark present, where human life is not valued.

personalfinance,Should I consolidate CC debt to one card?,"Stats:

Capital One: $744.77 at 19.80%
Discover: $935.19 at 17.99%

Luckily, these are my LAST two debts after paying off some car repairs and medical debts. Though I do have a car note due to be paid off in March (200 a month), but is not totally relevant to this question.

I opened up a new credit card with Chase solely for the purpose of purchasing tickets to NYC, booking a hotel room, food and transportation expenses during the trip to reap miles benefits and get the ticket discount. Note that all of this was reimbursed by the company I work for, so the balance on that card is $0 and I did not pay interest on those charges.

So, we have:

Chase $0 at 15.99%

Here's my question. The Chase card does not have formal balance transfer option, but I was thinking maybe I could just charge off my DC and CO cards onto this card for the lower interest rate and just pay a couple hundred a month on it until it's gone. Is there a reason I can't/shouldn't do this? Ideally, I'd like to get a card with a 0% for xx amount of time on balance transfers, but can't because I just got this card, plus I don't want to have a whole bunch of cards floating around.

personalfinance,Any downsides to saving a lot?,"I read this article on the frontpage that mentions US citizens almost have no savings. I'm from the Netherlands, so it's probably different here, but I wanted to ask anyways. 
I've always been quite frugal, so as I started to make more money, I simply started to save more. I don't make more than any of my friends, but unlike them I currently save about 30% of my salary after tax and they hardly save anything. I'm not rich by any means, but should I lose my job I can easily live for at least a year of my savings.
I always feel it's good to have some money saved for when buying a house or losing your job or whatever. But are there any downsides? I honestly don't even know how I would spend that extra 30% without wasting it. I own several luxury items (like I drive an older BMW, have Macbook, PS4, etc), but I like to look out for discounts, learn to do stuff myself to save some money. That sort of stuff. 

My girlfriends also saves a lot of her income so it's not like I'm this loner guy that's hoarding money, but we both are very aware of what comes in and what goes out.
Are there any downsides to saving a lot? I know interest rates are low and all, but other than losing to inflation each year I don't really know what issues there might be.

personalfinance,Point of a Traditional IRA,"So my question is what is the benefit of a Traditional IRA versus just using a standard brokerage account for longer term holdings.  Traditional IRAs you can deduct the annual contribution from your tax burden, however at withdrawal time the earnings are taxed at you're federal wage level (and not long term capital gains taxes)  In a hypothetical where you contribute 5k/year and yield 6% returns over 30 years, the IRA will grow to about 395k, and at retirement lets say the wage tax bracket is 30% where now its 35%.  In this example, you can deduct 52,500 from your tax burden (5k/year * 30 years)  however, at withdrawal time you will pay 30% of the 395,291 in gains, resulting in a tax bill of 118,587.  so youre net tax situation looks like 66,087.  If you were just to put this into long term capital gains, in a standard brokerage account your tax burden is 79,058 (20% cap gains rate)

this basically says a traditional will save you about 13k over 30 years.  If you're wage tax rate remains at 35% when you retire (we should be so lucky!) then the IRA actually results in paying MORE in taxes (85,852) versus capital gains in a traditional brokerage account (79,058)  

so unless your future tax rate is below 33.5% then it works against you to even bother.  

So my question is, what is the point of a Traditional IRA, it only seems to work out if you're tax rate at retirement is significantly below the (current) top tax rate.  If you're not, then it literally a worse way to invest.  Am I understanding this correct? I feel like I am missing something here but can't quite figure out what it is.

I understand they are guaranteed to meet the $100 value after 17 years, and most of them have. What I don't understand is how the interest works.

Additionally, does the interest rate gather based on the initial $50 dollar cost of the bond, or does it compound with the total current value of the bond?

My brother also got bonds from my grandmother, but she messed up his name on most of them (mostly middle name, but one or two have the wrong last name.) The SSN is correct on all of his bonds though. Will he have any troubles trading these in?

personalfinance,How should I handle my student loan debt?,"Hi all,

The grace period for my student loans will be ending in February. Luckily, I was able to find a job with a 50k salary + 15k signing bonus which I will begin in the new year. My question is just like the title says, how should I handle my student loan debt?


* ~32k in student loan debt
* All are Federal loans with rates ranging 3.4% - 6.8%
* I have ~2k in savings and no emergency fund
* I have enough in various stocks/investments that I can pay off my loan in one swoop, but it would also wipe it out
* I will be contributing to my 401k 
* I have no other debt - all my expenses are paid for by credit card and the full balance is paid off each month
* I don't know if it is relevant but my credit score is 750+

Would it be a smart choice to pay off my loans in one lump sum? However, the idea of wiping out my portfolio scares me. Perhaps taking some out just to pay off my highest balances/interest rates?

And another question that popped into my head: what should I focus on besides my student loan? Saving as much of my salary as possible?

Any help you all can provide is appreciated!",finance,1451125146

personalfinance,"38 years old making $40K, starting a new job (assistant prof) in a few months (raise to $64K) in a new city. Student loan payments haven't started yet, no debt otherwise besides car payment. Trying to plan out saving / investing.","Thread title has a lot of the basics, but essentially...

- I finished my Ph.D. in May of 2014, was in a long-term relationship and so didn't want to move to a new place, ended up taking what ended up being an entry-level position at a company for $40K / yr. Not great, but survivable where I live (Knoxville).

- went through another round of academic hiring this year (after LTR ended, I threw myself into writing, got several articles and boosted my CV), landed a tenure-track job outside Cincinnati, making $64K. Not great compared to some of the numbers I see on here, but not bad. I start in August (and will probably move there in July).

Basic stats:

**Debt and Obligations:**

* Student loan: $52K, on income based repayment plan which has me paying zero right now due to last year's tax returns.

* Car: $180 month

* Rent: $720 / month, will go up to $760 / month for the last couple months I'm in Knoxville (short-term lease)

* Utilities: $68 / internet, $120 / phone, ca. $80-110 / electric, $115 / insurance.

So that's pretty much it. No credit card payment (paid off). No other financial obligations, no kids, etc. Total monthly expenses for essentials (not including food, etc.) come to around **$1300**.

---

**Assets:**

* Around $3800 liquid (basically cash in a cigar box, squirreled away from band gigs, etc. Low interest rates, I figured on just keeping it around and available, and I know nothing about investing.)

* $3500 in savings.

* Bi-weekly paycheck, $1180 after taxes ($2360 / month after taxes).

So, after basic monthly expenditures, I'm left with about **$1000** to cover food, gas, entertainment, etc.

---

**Anticipated / Future:**

* New paycheck should be over $1000 more per month, around about $3600 after taxes, give or take.

* University health insurance and other benefits are pre-tax (not unusual) and will be much better and less expensive than my current company.

* University retirement plan is TIAA-CREF. Employer contributes 10% of pre-tax base pay, I contribute at least 5%. So every month around $800 or so into retirement savings, minimum.

* Base salary doesn't include summer teaching, which is expected. Could be an extra $4000-6000, depending.

---

At this point, I'm trying to figure out what the best plan is going forward. I'll be working most of the time up until I move, because I need to for obvious reasons. These expenses are unlikely to change significantly in the next few months.

What I'm trying to do at this point is get a realistic idea of what I can do now, and what I can start planning for, to handle two things:

1) student loans are going to kick in. I intend to stay on income based repayment, but it's going to be potentially several hundred a month.

2) I would like to consider purchasing a house after living in Cincinnati for a year or so and getting a lay of the land.

3) Retirement, obviously, but that's made easier by the TIAA account.

But, it'd be nice to be able to be one of those smart people that makes their money work for them.

I've been a student most of my life, ""managing my money"" basically meant hanging on to my receipts from the previous night's drinking, and making sure I kept putting a little into savings and not overspending. At that, I've managed to be a success, but the shit that some of you guys talk about and manage to do astounds me. I'd like to get a few tips, and maybe some advice about how to start really preparing for both the student loans and a house payment.

Any advice would be really appreciated.",finance,1451132586
politics,It seems to me that Health care needs a unique solution.,"Let me begin by saying that people generally agree that something needs to be done about healthcare, though the devil seems to be in the details.

I have heard mostly about two approaches: Deregulation and reverting more to privatized insurance, and movement towards single-payer. (both of which I understand are broad, but I think we all know what I am getting at)

Looking at various arguments in either direction caused me to think about a system which might work in ways which people in both camps might appreciate.

The general framework is as follows:

1. At the state/federal level, Provide for a basic level of ""Common Care"" to which every person is entitled, Through clinics or urgent care facilities

2.All care beyond the scope of the clinics would be the responsibility of the individual and their insurance. This would include ER/hospital stays and visits to your private practice for chronic illness or complicated procedures

3. remove the mandate for businesses to provide health insurance for employees allowing for the private market to have a larger pool of risk (forgive me for oversimplifying but just hold on)

Now for some specifics:

There is a large contingent of people who believe that people are entitled to healthcare as a right. I do not entirely agree nor do I disagree. I think that people are entitled to a basic level of care which acts to get them back on their feet from an injury or illness and serves to get them back in the workplace or whatever it is their responsibilities are. it seems to me that an investment from society on such care is a worthwhile investment for society, as treatment is typically inexpensive and allows for people to return to their job which helps the economy. it therefore makes since for this portion of healthcare to be provided universally. The product being a reduced load on emergency rooms for minor injury and ailment which will reduce cost of care in those places (that's the general idea anyway).

on the other hand we have complicated procedures and chronic illness which are more expensive to treat and have lower chances of success. treatment for these things which can be products of bad habits like smoking, seems more like a personal investment in the quality of your life and therefore should be ones own responsibility. This investment comes in the form of insurance which we can all agree is important.

Finally to make insurance as affordable as possible so that people can make this investment there needs to be a big change. (as I am sure you are all yelling about from point #3 but bear with me a moment)

Right now as I see it there are two markets for health insurance. people who are getting benefits from their business and those who are paying for their own insurance. This split in the market makes it more expensive for everyone because the risk pools are uneven. by removing the mandate everyone would be moved into one big pool and competition between insurance companies would drive down costs.(in theory) additionally this allows for increased wages because businesses don't have to spend all the money on big insurance plans. this is particularly helpful for smaller businesses who might have a hard time affording plans in the first place. Now this does not stop business from providing this benefit but it would be their choice, and they would be purchasing from the same market as everyone else.(again in theory)

The result of all of this would be:
reduced premiums, reduces healthcare costs, basic care for everyone, extraordinary care for people beyond basic care, increased wages, tools for business to draw the best employees.

Now i'm sure there are some flaws but this is the basic idea and I was wondering what people thought. So I eagerly await your critiques.
Edit: I should also say that it would be good to require insurance providers to be not for profit organizations which many already are.",finance,1451145258
personalfinance,Quick question about tax withholding [US],"Sorry if this is too basic, can repost in moronic Monday thread if needed. 


I work in sales and get paid hourly, each week, with a monthly commission bonus which varies monthly. This year I made $47,000, and had to constantly adjust my tax withholding to make sure I wasn't over/under paying. 
It's very frustrating and difficult to calculate since my commission amount can range between $1,300-4000 and the taxes taken out of that really hurt my take home pay. 

The question: Would it be a dumb idea to use the federal tax estimator to figure my annual taxes for 2016, and divide that by 52 and pay my 2016 taxes weekly instead of a %. I would have to file ""exempt"" with a set amount coming out of my check each week to do so. 

Is there a potential downside?

gaming,Star Wars Battlefront: An In-Depth Fan Discussion For The Intellectual Gamer. OR... A Good Argument Why Price Should Be Standardly Considered In Game Reviews. (Reposted from r/Star_Wars_Battlefront),"(For the TL;DR version... there is none. This discussion is for those of us who feel like our hopes and dreams for the sacred world of Gaming are being capitalized on too heavily, and are being taken advantage of. This discussion will hopefully spark further discussion about how we move on from here. Interspersed through this discussion is a short review for Star Wars Battlefront, but largely it uses the game as an example for debate among gamers for what is, I am afraid of, a view of the death of our beloved pastime/hobby.)

When I say that someone with a lot of money could save us from the dark side, I mean someone with a lot of money -- enough to buy this entire series, and the Frostbite engine from EA AND Disney to give us the Star Wars Battlefront that we all deserve by paying the amount we have, waiting the amount of time we have, and frankly, ALREADY OWN IF WE BOUGHT IT, but which has been locked before our eyes on the very software we currently have. It would need to be enough money to buy a Death Star because this game is owned by some pretty expensive owners who are showing off to their friends just how much money they have with owning this. Yet, compared to the size of the galaxy I thought I would be playing in when I bought Star Wars Battlefront and it's 50 dollar season pass... I feel like I am confined to playing in a Star Wars Museum, where very little is allowed to be touched (pretty, though, as it is) with only 21 rooms, 16 of which remain locked as of the time of writing this.

Star Wars Battlefront is a graphically intense game. The sights and sounds are second to none if you're looking for the authentic Star Wars experience. Almost everything that is in game has been crafted to capture the true image of what the movies have given us. And, while I can only speak for myself, I can tell you that I was extremely excited to play this game (and still am, although I bought this game on PC and have the luxury of requesting a refund, which I very well might, given what I am about to say here.)

Before I continue with what I can imagine will be a lengthy discussion of this game, let me say two things. I am not a game reviewer, I am a gaming -- and Star Wars -- fan. I am writing this discussion/review out of frustration for this game, but nonetheless, I will not exclude what I consider to be positives for the game. Another thing, I called this game years ago, and was correct about a few things that I will discuss here. I understand that some may disagree with the things that I find good and bad. While I speak only for myself, I do feel like this review is a statement on behalf of all gamers and Star Wars fans out there, and an appeal to the powers that control the quality of games. I am afraid that since I do not often write reviews, this 'review' will contain more of my greater philosophy for games and the industry that controls them than simply Star Wars Battlefront. But in keeping to the title of this post as to not waste or betray your time as the reader, Star Wars Battlefront is the main focus here.

Back in 2010, I was in the middle of playing Battlefield Bad Company 2: Vietnam when a thought occurred to me. Star Wars Battlefront 2 would be fun to play. As I switched over to that, I looked back at my copy of BBC2 and thought, I wish the people who made Bad Company 2 made a Star Wars Battlefront sequel. Fast forward nearly half a decade, and I was delighted to see just that in the works. ""I called it!"" I remember telling one of my friends, excitedly sharing in the news that, indeed, Digital Illusions CE (DICE), the 'Battlefield team', was in the process of making such a dream come true. I still remember the moment I felt it would be a good pair (and if you're thinking I am about to say it wasn't, I am not -- the only people I feel should have made this game are DICE, but we'll get there). It was during a Star Wars Battlefront 2 bot match (I am the boring guy who likes bot matches in the Battlefront series) where I saw a Trade Federation AAT fly past me that I thought, 'I would love to see this in updated detail' that I had the idea for DICE to make the next Battlefront. When I saw that DICE really was making the next Battlefront, the memory of seeing all of the vehicles from Battlefront 2 came to mind, and like so many other fans of the series, my imagination began to race with all of the potential that current games have shown to have. Finally, I thought to myself, a Star Wars Battlefront for the current generation of gamers, who have invested so much of their money in upgrading their hardware to make sure their games continue to look as good as they can! And it is being made by the people who brought us some of the most intense, exciting moments in multiplayer exhibition history (not to mention, the people who truly raised the bar above what we had previously been playing on with the likes of the Bad Company series, and Mirror's Edge).

So here we are, a little over a month after the release of what would have largely been considered the biggest multiplayer/bot match game of the year and... mixed reviews?

Why?

Well... other reviewers have their opinions, but I think I have one that isn't considered as much (if ever): price, aka cost.

Consider how the most recent iteration of Mortal Kombat on current generation systems cost $60. If you haven't played the most recent Mortal Kombat, please forgive my comparison (if it helps, neither have I, but that's beside the point). If you have played it, consider everything (everything) that is in that game. Whether of not you think Mortal Kombat is a good game or a bad game is not the point that I am making. The point that I am making is that Mortal Kombat cost the same amount of money as, say, Grand Theft Auto 5, or Star Wars Battlefront (excluding DLC that costs extra, which I will address momentarily). As the late Carl Sagan once said, ""All of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast as video in a single large American city in a single year. Not all bits have equal value.""

My point is that human beings are creatures of standards (I did say this might become a philosophical thing). We like standards. It is how we judge our decisions from day to day. We hold things to certain standards and if they fall short or exceed our standards, we notice it -- but we may not realize we notice it. We may complain or we may praise depending on how our standards (which are ever changing and evolving) are met. We see this in game reviews as comparisons to previous games that the presently reviewed game lives up to or falls short of. It is also, at times, unfair -- sometimes good games get poor reviews because the reviewer compares it to another game instead of looking at what is currently there, which is not fair in my opinion. Sometimes we compare apples to oranges, and the best responses to this that we get are people who call the reviewer out for doing so... but that reviewer often goes on to continue reviewing games that way. What we get are, what I consider to be, unfair reviews for games.

Many of us have heard the phrase, ""Time is money,"" and if you are wondering what that really means is that your time is worth money, which is a standard for measuring value of material things. I am not trying to insult your intelligence by saying that; I am more trying to bring people who may not share that view of Time=Money around to my way of seeing it. When you perform a job, your time is worth a certain amount of money. If you take that money, you are agreeing that your time was worth that amount of money, which in turn can afford you other things. If you save up your money, you are saving up time. The more money you have, the more time you have. If you are spending time, you are (often) spending money. Okay, you get the point.

I will consider the cost of ""base games"" for now, (meaning, the cost of a single game excluding any other cost for additional content). Most base games cost $60. It has become a standard. But considering the comparison to Mortal Kombat and Grand Theft Auto 5, two completely different games which cannot be reviewed in the same genre, we hold them to be standardly worth the same value. It would lead me to believe (and I could be wrong about this) that one of the two games took more time to make, and more people to make, yet both cost the same amount in the end. I am not saying that GTA is better than Mortal Kombat, but I am almost willing to bet money that GTA took more time to make than Mortal Kombat. Yet we were willing to pay the same amount for both. I remember telling my friends, upon playing GTA 5 for the first time, ""Now this is a $60 game!"".

So if we entertain my idea that $60 is not what a game is really worth to make, but really the standard to which we are willing to pay for a base game, we can then consider the cost of adding additional content for an additional price. Here is the new frontier of game pricing, where not all games charge us the same amount. Some games sell their ""Season Pass"" for $20, while other sell it for $50. Let us not forget that it was not until recently that Season Passes were common. I remember making the switch from $40 games on the PS2 and XBOX 1 to $60 games on the PS3 and XBOX 2. I remember thinking a few years ago that games on the PS4 and XBOX 3 would be even more expensive as a standard, but what we got was a clever way of hiding it: season passes.

Regardless of if you agree that additional content is worth any amount of additional money, or if it should be free when each player pays $60 dollars (and I admit that I do not know how much money developers are making for their games or spending on making them), we cannot deny that there are many people who are mocking the triple-A gaming industry right now for releasing incomplete games because they want you to buy more. I personally believe that games are simply worth around $120 each, if we are to assume that all lights in the dev studios are to be kept on while paying for each of the developers and publishers to do their jobs. I think they they are hurting themselves by essentially tacking on this extra 'Season Pass' when they could just be up front and say that they believe their game is really worth this much, but that is their choice, and it is only our choice whether or not we want to buy games at these prices.

What is true is that we are willing to buy games at these prices, including Season Passes, because we love games.

So now consider what it means to pay for any game, whatever the price, and we can refocus back on Star Wars Battlefront. By paying them $60 dollars, we are essentially telling them that we believe it is fair (otherwise, we wouldn't be paying) to charge $60 for the time the developers put into making their game. For the years we waited and anticipated, and the job the developers have done to make the game look like it does, us gamers say, ""Bravo! Here is your money, please let me play this!"" and we hand over our money. To pay that amount, again, we are saying that the years we have waited are what we are paying for.

Like the Star Wars Battlefront series before, the current Battlefront includes maps of iconic locations for us to explore (large maps, in my opinion), the combined plethora of vehicles, units, and weapons; and bots. However, there are only 4 maps (5 if you include a free DLC map) in the base game. And the bot matches, something that a lot of gamers were excited to hear the return of, are confined to only one small portion of each map (that is, not small portions of each map, which can be chosen or voted upon but only the same small portion of each map -- that is, to play against bots there are only 4 very small maps to play on, which are portions of larger maps that you can play on in multiplayer -- so the doors that you want to walk through to go deeper into the beautiful map that was created simply don't open, you're stuck). And while I admit that the low player counts in multiplayer may be a result of the completely unrecognized PC servers (since Sony and Microsoft have a 'system' that they can advertise on TV for gamers to play on), PC gamers, in the absence of online games to play, are stuck playing on 4 cramped maps in the base game for the current Battlefront.

I read somewhere that it was probably done on purpose to encourage online play, and that it may be open to more expansive bot maps later, but what about right now, since I still feel the emptiness of my wallet from buying the game? Granted, I bought the game for $35 on EA's winter sale. Oh, and about that.

Hey, all you early adopters of Star Wars Battlefront who paid your $60 for Battlefront when it first came out/pre-ordered... How do you feel about one month after launch I was able to buy that same game for $35 brand new from the publisher? I could go into how much this news is going to hurt EA and Disney, and while damage is not my goal, you do have a right to know that back at the EA store (as of right now) Star Wars Battlefront is $35 for the base game.

So now let's discuss the potential for expansion. Given that we consider $60 to be a reasonable amount to pay for a game that has taken years to make, and includes 4 maps (5 including one free DLC map), does does 5/6ths of the cost of the base game seem a reasonable amount to pay for a mere 16 more maps? For 10 more dollars, we would be willing to pay for Battlefront 4 (at today's rate).

I say all of this not because I am trying to spark an console vs PC argument; not because I am trying to say that Battlefront is not fun; not because I am saying that Mortal Kombat is not worth what people have been willing to pay for it... when you hear discussion about ""People need to vote with their wallets"" and ""If we don't believe games are worth this much, we should not buy them"" we are often greeted by people simply saying, ""But that won't happen; people will continue to buy these games at the current prices."" Sure, I am not suggesting we boycott gaming nor am I suggesting we IGNore (yes, that's on purpose) what is happening. I suggest we talk about this more. The next time you are at Gamestop (former employee, here) and they ask if you want the season pass for a game, why not ask them their thoughts about it? Instead of just saying yes or no, maybe ask them, 'Are you going to get it?' and just see what happens. These are video games. There is no intrinsic value in them. If you buy a game from Gamestop, unwrap it after the purchase, and try to sell it back to them 60 seconds later, see for yourself what Gamestop believes that game is worth.

Our money is our time. And our time is being taken advantage of. Let's spread the word, and contribute new ideas to this discussion that I cannot think of. If you made it this far, thank you for your time. When was the last time EA thanked us for our time? Or Ubisoft? Or any game developer, no matter how great or honest? I thank you for your time, because it is time you'll never get back. I appreciate it and I hope it was not a waste for you. If it was, I apologize... but you did choose to spend it here.

- $2,500 credit card debt (17% interest rate, paying $150 a month in an attempt to pay it off)
- Already in the process of looking for a used vehicle in the $7,500  range (I was planning on doing this before receiving the check as my current vehicle is done for, old vehicle should bring about a $1,000 as a down payment hopefully)
- Manageable $30,000 student loans
- A few bucks in savings

My plan right now is to pay off the credit card in whole, perhaps use no more than $1,000 to supplement the car down payment so I can have the car payed off in less than 2 years, and then stick the rest in savings as an emergency fund, while also taking the money that I've been using to pay off the credit card and throwing that into savings as well.

I need some advice with some money that will be coming my way soon.

investing,My Personal 2016 Macro Investing Guide,"Key Macro Trends:

Low Commodity Prices
US Presidential Elections
Rising Interest Rates

So for the first issue of low commodity prices it seems pretty obvious that now may one of the best times in recent memory to invest in energy due to the nature of the pricing environment. Don't really see a high probability of prices dramatically falling again so I think it'd be wise to put a fair percentage of one's portfolio into energy stocks with moderate yields, but high security (think XOM). You can get a few cheap blue chips with extraordinary yields that will most certainly make a a buyer a small fortune in the incoming years regardless of if prices turn around or not. 

Second of where things get a bit more interesting. The nature of any election is uncertainty, but that does us no good if we're dealing with stocks alone. So for the election I'm thinking we look into options on stocks that will be dramatically affected by the outcome. I'm looking to make a few straddles to play the upcoming volatility regarding three major issues in the election: 

1) Healthcare: GOP Candidate likely to try and Repeal ACA 
2) Defense: Obvious party divide behind military funding
3) Gun Control: Increased media coverage on these shootings have pressed the issue to become a topic of hot discussion in the upcoming election once the primary's are 
over. 

Hoping I can get Jan 17 straddles on some major pharma players (Johnson &amp; Johnson, Phizer, etc.) major defense contractors, (Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon), and lastly gun stocks (Stern, Smith &amp; Wesson, Ruger). 

Lastly I'm going to long bank stocks in benefit to rising interest rates. I feel like the long period of ZIRP, and tight monetary regulation is finally loosening up as we begin to see the nation begin to forget about 2008. Hopefully this can allow commercial banking to make much higher profits from loans and help the investment banks begin to increase opportunities as investors pressure the exuberant amount of startups created during ZIRP to go public in hopes of liquidating their investments and meeting the required WACC needed. 

Any other ideas/macro events and plays upon them would be helpful as I'm looking to set up my 2016 portfolio. Also any feedback on the ideas I have is much appreciated.

2016 Investment Strategy:  Long Energy stocks, Straddle Defense Healthcare and Gun stocks, long bank stocks.

Variable - Better rate, but with the way the market is, should I be nervous about the rate increasing? Also I've been told that I can lock into a fixed rate at any time should I feel the interest rate will be rising, true or are there any hidden implications to this?

Fixed - Seems you can get around 2.7-2.8% without much trouble from a major lender for a 5 year fixed. To me this doesn't sound like a bad option, and with less risk involved.

So again, I'm needing to know where should my emergency fund be? I have a savings account with 12,000 currently. That is where I keep the emergency fund. I don't withdraw from it except in cases of need. If you could help me hone in the number I need it to be that would help step 2 being easier.

Second, I need to know how much of this money should go towards my student loans. Obviously there is no way to kill all of the loans off, but I can see that I could easily kill 1 or two loans with some of this money.

I know some of you are looking at my idea and saying ""Where's the retirement fund?"" The answer is I don't have one and my job won't let me open my 401K until I've been there 6 months. I live in Ohio and worked with the government for the summer over 9 years and have about 2500 in an OPERS account. I do not know if I will return to government work, so I'm not sure if I should look into withdrawing that money to pay off loans or not. As it stands I can not get anything from my employer for a 401K until May. 

And since I have less money than student loans, I did not bother going to the IRA steps of the money guide. 

Now, I am also willing to let the money sit if that's the better option, but I just have an intuition that this money (some of it, that is) should go to these student loans. If you have a better plan for me to look in to, please tell me about it below.

Thanks again for all your advice, I'll be trying to comment to you as you need me to, for information I neglected to put in this post.",finance,1451231323
Banking,Real Interest Rate calculation method,"Real Interest Rate calculation method:

Calculate the real rate of interest when you are dealing with periodic interest capitalization. Otherwise, the actual rate and the nominal rate – is given by the bank – are the same. The real interest rate you need to know the nominal interest rate and the number of compounding periods per year. In this example you will use one of the financial Effect function to calculate the real interest rate, the nominal rate of 5% and quarterly capitalization.
Theory: Real interest rate = nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. The real interest rate = 8% – 3% = 5%
An example, if you are earning 4% interest per year on the savings in your bank account, and inflation is currently 3% per year, then the real interest rate you are receiving is 1% (4% – 3% = 1%). The real value of your savings will only increase by 1% per year, when purchasing power is taken into consideration.
Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate – Inflation (Expected or Actual)
formula quoted for Real rate:

A = P( 1 + r )^(t)

210 = 200( 1 + r )

1.05 = 1 + r

r = 0.05*100 = 5% = Nominal Interest

Inflation rate is 2% ( Because when the price level increase = The Inflation = ( CPI this year – CPI last year ) / CPI last year x 100% )

    Real interest Rate = Nominal Interest – Inflation = 5% – 2% = 3%
    The interest rate= 5% or 200x.05=10, in this case simple interest rate=compound interest rate or 200(1.05)-200=10.
    Real interest rate = 5-2=3%
    Summary: Real rate also include nominal rate, inflation rate multiply by 100= Real rate",finance,1451231874

That means that I would pay for 25 years straight and still owe about what I do now, but the debt would be to the IRS vs the student loan company. I would like to avoid that and start making a difference on the principal balance now. Does anyone know of a bank or program that might be more willing to let me refinance at a lower rate?

I used to think Bitcoin was this epic economic experiment, for obvious reasons. But there's something special about currencies, they require communities. That is the only real thing that makes a thing a currency. Scarcity, store of value, unit of account blah blah blah -- it's all fluff all the way down to the group of people that agree ""this is money.""
And now look at Bitcoin. The scalability development process degraded into another reality TV show. It's just like the FOMC controlling markets by balancing a 0.25% carrot on their dog's nose for a year, or the circus of the US presidential election.

I seriously actually thought we would get an increased block size before the Federal Reserve raised rates. Hopefully we can settle on a group of core devs to follow before the election!

Until then have fun mixing and matching: FOMC / core devs / CNN / Theymos / DNC / Blockstream / Greg / Peter / Gavin / Trump / Sanders / Hillary / Democrat / Republican / Independent / Core / XT / Unlimited",cryptocurrency,1451256183
personalfinance,[Budget] needs work but I'm not sure where to start.,"Husband and I are having a budgeting meeting tonight. We have had a very difficult two years with job loss and living beyond our means. I could use input on our current budget for a family of three who live in a very high cost of living area.

Rent- $1995

Gas bill -$35 (winter)

Electric bill - $25

Gas - about $45 every two weeks depending on how much I drive for work (I get reimbursed for mileage at the federal rate).

Car loan - $79 minimum ($385 until pay off)

Car insurance - $97 monthly (currently paid in full until May)

Pet supplies - $150 (possibly more depending on how much meds my elder rabbit needs)

Phone bill - $179 for two phones ($50 a month of bill is financing for the phones; 10 more payments remaining)

Food - about $175 weekly

Daycare $1,050 monthly

Laundry - $25 week

Credit card 1 - $4890 ($5000 limit), monthly payment is $98

Credit card 2 - $5700 ($6000 limit), monthly payment is $160-180)

Credit card 3 - $1507; minimum payment is $50 but is at 22.7% interest (was at 0 but we missed a payment, not on purpose, just didn't have any money)

Parental loan 1 - $500 to in laws

Parental loan 2 - $1500 to my parents

Some extra info:
I make $48,000, husband makes $38,400 + commission (has received 1 paycheck so commission is not known). We live in the Bay Area and this is the only apartment we could find to rent. I was the only person earning a regular wage from August until beginning of December (hence the parental loans).

I know our phone bill is high, but we have unlimited data and use our phones for Internet at home.

Through trial and much error we now live fairly frugally. We don't eat out, or go out. We do occasionally buy coffee. We have no saving, and I am not contributing to my 403b (4%) match but that will change with the new year. Did I forget anything? Any suggestions for improvements?",finance,1451257700

I'm just not sure if I should do it now, or pay it off with my paychecks as they come in (which will take about 6mo).

personalfinance,Large amount of student debt. Payments are over 40% of what I make a month. Help!,"Hi! Unfortunately, it has come time for me to pay the piper. My student loan payments are now due, and they're hefty. I have:

personalfinance,Timetable for carbuying,"Here's my situation:

- Right now I make $19.08/hour, and I'm getting a raise to $22.28/hour by mid-January (so I pull in about $2300/month after taxes right now)

- I have a 2004 Ford Explorer that I bought through a ""0% interest"" used car place that has about $900 left to pay off

- I have about $2400 in credit debt, with an interest rate of 19%

- I borrowed $1500 from my grandparents over the summer after I lost my job, and I have $1300 to pay off on that

- My credit score is bad, thanks to a brief stint of unemployment over the summer. Last I checked, it was between 500 and 520

- My rent and other monthly bills (not including debt payments) add up to $1185

- My tax refund should be *around* $3600. I'm moving out of my apartment for a cheaper spot in a month or two, so I should get my $1080 security deposit back, and - if I pay off my Explorer - I could get between $2000 and $2500 through private sale

So, based on who I've talked to, I seem to have three options:

&gt;1. Shoot for financing now and end up with an *insane* interest rate because my credit score is shot and outside of a mediocre trade-in I don't have any money to put down yet. If the car payments weren't more than $250 or $300, this is doable. Tight - until March, at least - but doable.

&gt;2. Continue making regular monthly payments on debts, wait things out until March and sell my Explorer private party when everything's paid off. With any luck, this'll give me something like $2000 (plus whatever I have saved) on a down payment for a car. 

&gt;3. Continue making regular monthly payments on debts, but instead of using those large sums to pay off my debts, I use them for a down payment on a vehicle. This, combined with a potential $2000 private sale of my Explorer would give me something like $4000 to put down.

The cars I'm currently looking at are a 2014 Ford Fusion SE for $13k, a 2015 Hyundai Sonata for $14k, and a 2015 Kia Optima for $15k. They're all pretty basic models, one owner, and I've test driven all of them. I like the Optima the most, with the Sonata a close second. 

I'm sure a lot of you will tell me to keep the Explorer until it busts, but I need something better on gas. I get *maybe* 10MPG on a good day, and the mechanical issues I'm running into are turning out to cost more than they're worth.

I have private student loans totalling about $21k and some change, with 6-7% interest rates. (I also have a few government ones, but they aren't as much, have lower interest rates, and don't have a cosigner, so I'm honestly not as bothered by them.) My boyfriend has offered to pay them off for me, and then I could just pay him back without worrying about interest. This isn't the first time he's offered (or just suggested that I make larger payments), but after seeing the interest (and how much it took up in my payments) and that I'd be paying an extra $10k over the next 10-ish years, he's become a bit more adamant about it. He doesn't like the idea of just wasting $10k that could've been used for other things.

I never really had much of an issue with making base payments for 10 years - even if it meant paying more in the long run. I am very aware that this is a wrong way of thinking and that it's better to just get the debt out of the way (which really, I'd prefer), but I'm very attached to actually having money that's mine (even though as long as I'm in debt, it's not really ""mine""). That said, I've been paying for the loans through our shared bank account (we each have personal accounts, but this one is for bills, rent, food, medical things, etc.), which is a leftover from when I was unemployed. I never got around to switching it over, and he didn't mind - until now.

He's very interested in buying a house in the future, but since he says that he's making considerably more than he spends (and he's decided not to invest any of it), it would be better for it just get used like this than have it just sit in his bank account doing nothing.

personalfinance,"Submitted my last check for my tuition! All 4 years by myself, no loans!","Long time lurker of this sub. Just a little bit of a background...

I come from a working class family where not one intermediate family member has gone to college. Upon graduation from High School, I was pressured by my parents to not attend college and to pursue a blue-collar job just like my brother and sister. They believed that I would do just fine with just a decent job and didn't like the risk I was taking with college. 

I told them I didn't want a decent job. Now... I am aware that you can get a good job without a degree but that's besides the point. My parents were unable to help with any financial contribution to my tuition and I absolutely refused to take out any loans because of the financial burden it would have on my future after graduation.

In order to make this work, I ended up commuting to my college for my first 2 years. My 3rd year I lived in a 2 bedroom apartment on the edge of campus and this year (final year) I live in a 3 bedroom apartment on the edge of campus. 

Commuting obviously saved me a ton of money because of the rent aspect so my parents did end up helping me there. 

I ended up working about 30 hours a week since the start of my freshman year of college until recently where I picked up a 2nd job upping my hours to around 50 hours a week. Note that this was maintaining a full-time schedule with school. Tuition was about 4.5k per semester and I took a few summer classes which ranged from 1-3k per summer for 3 summers. 

During this recent Summer (2015), I pursued two study abroad programs through my University. I ended up applying for a large amount of scholarships to help out for this which cut the cost down to about 1/3. Before the trip...my junker of a car broke down and it wasn't worth getting it fixed so I bought a newer ish car for around 11k out of pocket. 

I lived sort of frugally throughout these last 4 years to be able to accomplish all of this and I consistently applied for scholarships throughout all 4 years as well. Scholarships took about half of the cost down for my tuition expenses.

TL;DR - Worked my ass off, applied for scholarships, kicked my college tuition's ass.

EDIT 1: Addressing some questions and concerns from the comments... I double major in Entrepreneurship and Marketing. I currently go to an in-state University. With my job that I had through all of college, I was able to do a lot of my emailing and research on slow days and I took a 1-2 online classes along with classes on campus. My 2nd job that I picked up for my senior year was a bouncer job (security) at a local college bar where the hours were 3rd shift so it cut into my sleep schedule but it gave me a secondary source of income.

EDIT 2: I just turned 22 as well. Some people are questioning my field of study as well as the University I currently attend because it wasn't expensive and prestigious. I have job offers lined up and am working with a job coach that is guiding me to phenomenal employers. For the spring of 2016, I landed an unpaid internship at a federal level in a nearby location. They are working me a minimum of 18hours per week which cuts heavily into my current workload and time. I know I am taking a huge risk with the ""unpaid' factor and my time but this will make my resume look very strong.

EDIT 3: The feedback here is overwhelming and I wish I can show you guys how much I appreciate the positive comments. I have been following this sub reddit now for quite awhile now and every story or piece of advice submitted on this sub has helped me and is helpful to others. Again, thank you so much for the positive feedback! Happy holidays!",finance,1451275191

I'd like to start saving for retirement and also, I have a baby and I'd like to start saving for her college.

1. For my retirement- should I keep my B of A Money Market IRA (with an interest rate of 0.08%) or move my dough to another investment vehicle? My brother goes on about Vanguard for investing, but I'm not sure about the particular fund.
2. For my baby's college- After maxing for retirement, should I go with a B of A 529 offered through Merrill or go elsewhere? I should note that I live in CA which DOES tax 529's.

Her financial adviser suggested she take out a HELOC for the largest amount she is allowed, and keep it as a safety net in case of an emergency. He said it could provide a source of income in case she loses her job, without needing to draw from her retirement accounts early (she wants to delay her IRA withdrawals and social security payments until she is 70). To be clear, he is not suggesting she draw on the HELOC, but only open the credit line now. She has a great credit score and an average income, so hopefully that would mean a low interest rate. Her marginal tax rate is already quite low so no advantage there.

investing,A Back-of-the-Envelope Calculation of Leveraged ETF returns From 2005 to 2015.,"Lately, there has been a fair share of threads on leveraged ETF. Intuitively, it sounds like a great idea: there is a positive risk premium associated with investing, causing stocks – on average – to trend up over the long run. Adding leverage should complement this effect. 

Leveraged ETFs like [SPXL]( http://www.direxioninvestments.com/products/direxion-daily-sp-500-bull-3x-etf) are created with the goal of replicating 3x (300%) the returns of the S&amp;P 500 *for a single day*. Yet, when [looking at the charts](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=SPXL+Interactive#symbol=SPXL;range=my), one can’t help getting a warm, fuzzy feeling as you can clearly see SPXL trending from $15.42 (Nov 3, 2008) to $84.98 (Dec 28, 2015) (**+451.22%**). Not too shabby compared to SPY (**+118.93%**). 

An inherent risk to leveraged ETFs is the so-called leverage decay. As the fund manager ‘resets’ the ETF on a daily basis, leverage is added as the index trends up, while leverage is decreased as the index trends down. Basically, the fund exposes you to the fallacy of ‘buy high, sell low’ – or at least, that is the thought behind it. However, since the index tends to trend up. The main question we should be asking ourselves is: is the decay *stronger* than the generally assumed upward trajectory of stocks?

---

**A Brief Background on Leverage ETFs**

It wasn’t until March 2008 that the Securities and Exchange Commission began to authorize the creation of actively managed ETFs. It didn’t take too long before leveraged ETFs sprung into existence. The fund managers of these ETFs typically enter into total return swaps with institutional counterparties, allowing them to replicate a magnified movement of the underlying index (often x2 or x3).

---

**Leverage Decay: a Real Problem?**

To give an illustration of how leverage decay works, imagine the S&amp;P going up 1% on day one, and going down 1% in the subsequent day. 



% Change | S&amp;P 500 | S&amp;P 500 x3
---|---|----|----
Starting cash: | $10,000 | $10,000 | 
+1% | +$100 | +$300 |
 | $10,100 | $10,300 | 
-1% | -$101 | -309
 | $9,999 | $9,991

Imagine the S&amp;P wobbling up and down roughly 220 days per year, and you get a pretty good mental image of how the leverage decay is supposed to destroy your returns.

But then; why doesn’t it show?

To test whether the upward trend cancels out the leverage decay, I used data from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/SP500/downloaddata). Starting date Dec 5, 2012, up to the present day (Dec 28, 2015). On the basis of the S&amp;P points, I calculated the daily change. Using this change, I calculated 3 different scenarios:

- 1: **S&amp;P 500** 
- 2: **S&amp;P 500 x3**. Using ‘traditional’ leverage. That is, assuming one has $10,000 in cash, a $20,000 loan. His net worth is still $10,000, but his returns are amplified by 3.
- 3: **S&amp;P 500 x3 ETF**

---

**Limitations**

- The dataset is not complete. Over the course of 10 years, data for 89 days was incomplete. Results may therefore slightly diverge. Especially when bearing in mind that the additional data points are important to measure the leverage decay.
- Dividends are not included. This works in favour of leveraged ETFs; e.g. SPY pays dividend, and most leveraged ETFs don’t pay dividend. Some have during their early days, but since it is nowadays common practice to enter into total return swaps, dividends are generally not collected. 
- The calculations do not include fees, which are generally higher for leveraged ETFs.
- I do not and cannot guarantee my soberness while running the data.

---

**Test 1: Leverage Decay During a Crisis**

As noted before, leveraged ETFs have been here only since the crisis. Looking at SPXL, you are looking at a leveraged ETF which has never seen the concept of a financial crisis. With my data starting in 2005, you can see that the crisis puts a [serious drag](http://i.imgur.com/2FT5okN.png) on the results:

In 10 years, the S&amp;P 500 returned 64.02%, excluding dividends. If you were to have a interest-free loan, you would have had quite a scary 2008 as your net worth dipped quite far below $0. If you wouldn't have pulled out, you would have a 192.06% return after 10 years. That is, once again, excluding dividends. Employing 3x leverage, only the dividend yield would have been appealing. 

On the other hand, the leveraged ETF gets crushed during the crisis. After that, it hardly manages to break even. 19.02% in 10 years is not something be proud of.

---

**Test 2: Assuming a 6% Loan**

Naturally, other people’s money generally doesn’t come for free. That is, if you do not have the opportunity to take out interest free loans like many European students do. Assuming you would invest a 6% loan in the S&amp;P 500, and assuming that you would have to pay the 6% on an annual basis, [your returns would look different](http://i.imgur.com/ivDgmlB.png). 

**Limitation**: Once again, dividends are not factored in. If you would have a 2:1 leverage ratio, probably the dividend payout could easily cover the interest expenses. 

In this scenario, I subtracted $1,200 ($20,000 loan x 0.06) on an annual basis. Y1 $1,200, Y2 $2,400, etc. 

This time, you were significantly tested during the 2008 financial crisis. You would still have come out ahead pretty far. Especially if dividends would have been factored in. 

---

**Test 3: 2009-2015**

Naturally, looking at the past 6 years, coming straight out of a major bull market, results will look different. [I like this chart](http://i.imgur.com/qjr56nb.png) because it shows something that a Yahoo Finance comparison of SPY and SPXL does not show. In times of volatility like Aug 2015, SPXL gets crushed. This makes sense as the 3x leverage works both ways. What is also curious is how poorly the 3x ETF tracks the *real* leverage (using an interest-free loan, in this case). In 2013, the 3x ETF starts outperforming the traditional leverage (again, set aside dividends), but it does so in a much more volatile and unpredictable way. 

Moreover, it also appears that the 3x ETF goes down harder relative to the traditional leverage.

---

**To Conclude**

Looking at leveraged ETF charts, leverage decay does not look like a real issue. In fact, in a major bull market, a leveraged ETF can outperform even traditional 3x leverage using borrowed money, as the leveraged ETF keeps ‘doubling up’, continuously increasing its exposure to the underlying index. As long as you are in bull market territory, this is *awesome*. 

Yet, you forego dividends, and if another major recession or crash happens, you may never see your initial investment go back to where it was. If you want to lever up, traditional leverage makes more sense. 

**Disclaimer: This is, of course, no recommendation use leverage. Nor should the foregoing be used to make any investment decision, as I made these calculations solely to see the effects on a market downturn on a leveraged ETF - in a very simplified manner.

EU nations held several top-level summits on the emergency, but no collective response was forthcoming, leading to much recrimination between the 28-member states. Countries such as Britain and France were accused of not doing enough to take in refugees, while “front line” states Greece, Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia complain they are being overwhelmed by the influx.

Internal EU tensions have threatened to unravel the founding principles of the bloc, such as the free movement of citizens under the Schengen Agreement. Germany, under Chancellor Angela Merkel, has emerged as the most generous of EU states, taking in the largest numbers of asylum seekers. However, Merkel’s ruling Christian Democrat party has incurred a backlash from anti-immigrant groups. Elsewhere Europe has seen the rise of right-wing, anti-immigrant and anti-EU political parties, from the National Front in France to the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in Britain. Similar gains for ultra-nationalists have been made in Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium.

The bitter irony of the EU immigration crisis and its pressure on the foundations of the bloc is that most of the would-be immigrants have come from war-torn Syria. As astute observers – published by RT and other alternative media, but censored out of the Western media – have noted, the conflict in Syria precipitating the refugee crisis has come about from unlawful interference in the Arab country by the EU. Britain and France have given military support to an insurgency against the elected government of President Bashar al-Assad, along with support from the US and its regional allies, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

Heresy of truth: Terrorist blowback

Most of the insurgent groups in Syria are in fact comprised of foreign mercenaries espousing radical Islamist ideologies, associated with internationally designated terrorist groups, such as Al-Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). The latter claimed the massacre in Paris on November 13, when some 130 people were killed in gun and bomb attacks. But to say “blowback” in the Western media is tantamount to outrageous thought-crime. It is verboten.

The EU has previously sanctioned the Syrian government, saying it is responsible for the violence in the country. In 2014, Brussels aided the insurgency by lifting an embargo on oil exports from Syrian areas under the control of anti-government militants, whose dominant faction is the IS terror group. Thus, in a very real way, the EU has fueled the conflict in Syria by aiding and abetting illegally armed militants, which has boomeranged into the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War – a crisis that is straining the very existence of the EU.

Russia’s game changer

Russia’s military intervention in the Syrian conflict in support of its long-time ally beginning on September 30 has transformed the dynamic. Russia’s intervention, along with that of Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah resistance movement, is the only lawful foreign contingency in the five-year-old war, because it has been requested and approved by the Syrian government.

All other foreign interventions in Syria from the United States and EU members, Britain, France and Germany, are in violation of international law. Russia’s intense aerial bombardment against all illegally armed militants, including the IS and Al Nusra Front, is not encumbered with the false dichotomy articulated by the US-led military coalition, which disingenuously divides militants into extremists and moderates. In three months of Russian aerial operations, the losses suffered by anti-government militants in Syria have been much greater than during 16 months of bombing by the US-led coalition. That is because Russia is working in close liaison with the Syrian Arab Army, which is now making sweeping ground advances. Also, the US and its allies are accused of not being fully committed to combating terrorist groups in Syria, because these militants are at the same time being used by Washington and its partners as proxy forces to illegally achieve regime change in Syria.

The US, Britain and France have reportedly supplied weapons to so-called “moderate rebels” only for these weapons and indeed fighters to end up with the known extremist brigades of IS and Al Nusra. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have also funded Islamist networks, such as Jaish al Fatah and Ahrar al Shams, which are known to be involved with IS and Al Nusra.

Oil smugglers are us

Russia’s dramatic intervention in Syria has exposed what can only be described as a charade in which the US, European powers and their regional allies have been involved in trying to destroy a sovereign country through covertly supporting an array of illegally armed mercenary networks.

A central part of the charade is how NATO member and EU aspirant Turkey has been involved in smuggling oil and weapons across the Syrian border. Russia’s concerted airstrikes have exposed the Turkish connection to the Western-backed illegal regime-change operation in Syria, and no doubt that was a factor in why Turkish fighter jets shot down a Russian warplane on November 24.
Trump and the American descent into fascism

There were several other significant developments this year. The emergence of billionaire property magnate Donald Trump as US presidential contender marks the full outward degeneration of American politics, whereby demagoguery, racism and fascism have entered into mainstream public discourse. This is while US police violence against African-Americans and other minorities reaches epidemic proportions; and federal state powers of surveillance and arrest continued to erode civil rights.
US-backed aggression in Yemen

A foreign war of aggression on Yemen by a US-backed military coalition of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states demonstrated a descent into lawlessness, where the United Nations appears more impotent than ever to uphold international law. Thousands of Yemeni civilians have been slaughtered by US-supported bombardment on residential areas lasting nine months and counting, yet Western media have largely overlooked those crimes, focusing instead on allegations of violations against civilians by Russian warplanes in Syria.

Nuclear deal with Iran… based on fake allegations

The conclusion in July of the P5+1 nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers was hailed as a triumph of diplomacy by US President Barack Obama. Of lesser note in the Western media was the decision by the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, to terminate its 10-year investigation into alleged Iranian nuclear weapons development. The IAEA said it had concluded there was no evidence of any Iranian activity to build a nuclear bomb. That means 10 years of Western claims against Iran have been trumped-up and the rationale for crippling Western-imposed economic sanctions on Iran is likewise null and void. So when are Washington and its European allies going to compensate Iran with billions of dollars for damage inflicted for no legal reason on its economy and nation’s health?

US provocation towards China

With so much apparently going in the news, the tensions between the US and China have probably not received the attention deserved. Nevertheless, these tensions are truly alarming. The US has made several provocative military intrusions on China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, the latest one being a B-52 bomber that “accidentally” made a flyover. It is noteworthy that the US aggression came only weeks and months after China’s President Xi Jinping made his first-ever state visit to the US earlier this year. President Obama may say the US welcomes “the peaceful rise of China”. But all the indications are that the US is doing everything to antagonize Beijing and to thwart its perceived global power status.

This year, the US Pentagon nominated China and Russia as primary “national security threats”. This is while the US ratchets up gratuitous tensions with both countries in the South China Sea and through NATO expansion around Russian territory. NATO’s enlisting of former Soviet country Montenegro in the Balkans as its newest member is further testimony to the relentless expansion of the US-led military alliance since the end of the Cold War nearly 25 years ago – in flagrant contradiction of past agreements with Moscow not to let NATO encroach on Russian interests.

Putin speaks truth to power

Yet the year ends with the US and its European allies slapping more economic sanctions on Russia over alleged infringements in Ukraine, when conflict in the latter country is clearly, and provably, a result of the kind of Western interference that Putin highlighted at the UN.

Putin made a seminal speech at the UN General Assembly in September when he clearly called out rogue powers who have trashed international law with illegal military, political and economic interventions overseas. The deterioration of legal standards, sovereignty and explosion of conflicts and terrorism in many parts of the world can be directly attributed to the machinations of the United States and its European partners. “Do you see now what you have done?” asked Putin before the UN.
70 years on, Russia still leads the battle against barbarism

The year 2015 marked the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, when Nazism and European fascism was defeated mainly through the military might and sacrifices of the Soviet Union. Notably – and appropriately in a profoundly true sense – the commemorations held in Moscow to mark that epic victory against fascism were not attended by the political leaders from the US, Britain, France and other European countries, owing to their alleged disputes with Russia over Ukraine.

Seventy years after the defeat of fascism in Europe, once again the battle against barbarism, rogue states and state-sponsored terrorism is very much extant today. And once again, it is Russia that is holding the line against all-out descent into international barbarism.

personalfinance,[PSA] College doesn't have to be expensive,"Hey young people,

Generation Y and Z are growing up in a world where private college costs upward of 70k a year (I'm sure in some of the larger cities it's over 80k now). State Colleges can be upwards of 25k per year. That is a LOT of money. Even after scholarships (which can be lost very easily), that's a pretty chunk of change.

That price tag is statistically not worth it. With fewer than 50% of college entrants actually graduating, that is a lot of money to put on the line if you don't have it. Unsecured loans are dangerous things. And you can't get rid of that debt. You either pay it off, do indentured servitude to get the government to pay it off, or you die and it goes to your estate. (NOTE: I got a little excited and misspoke here. Ty to commentors for pointing that out. Federal Loans are discharged, and private loans go to the estate. Parent PLUS Loans, interestingly, are discharged if either parent or child passes.) That's nasty.

But, rejoice! College doesn't have to be expensive. I live in a pretty expensive state, so using the same math where you are may be less expensive.

Community College classes are about $500 right now here. Lets say you need 60 credit hours for your associates. That will come out to something like 16 classes because your lab classes will be 4 credits. So right now our first two years of college (in a 4 year degree) will cost $500*16 = $8,000 (or $4,000 per year). Not terrible.

But wait, you said Associates? Yes! Most states offer direct admission to their state universities or college with completion of your first 2 years at a community college. So we transfer to a state school and have to pay all that money? Yes and no.

So you decide to go to a state college. Here, I can get to 3 of them in under an hour. The closest is about 25 minutes away. I see a price tag of $4,800 a semester (for unlimited classes and college stuff). So 4 more semesters for a bachelors is 4*$4,800 = 19,200. (Or $9,600 per year) Woah! That's a lot of money to spend.

But we are averaging our education costs over a 4 year period, right? So $19,200 + $8,000 = $27,200 = $6,800 per year. That's not THAT bad.

But where do you get that much money??!! I'm going to use my states minimum wage because it at least partially correlates to the cost of living (and education). At $9.15 an hour, you need to work an average of 14.25 hours a week AT MINIMUM WAGE. This number was before taxes, but at that income level, after standard deduction and an education credit, you really won't be paying any taxes.

Your next thought is ""I'm not sure I can go to school and work."" Oh but you can (probably). Lets take our traditional year of 8 classes (4 Fall + 4 Spring). If we drop it to 2 during the traditional semester, take 1 WinterSession, 1 MaySession, and one during a Summer1 and Summer2 session, we are still taking 8 classes per year. So a part time student will still be on pace with their full time cohorts who take summers off.

2 Classes a semester??!! Yes! This comes out to about 6 class hours per week (which will often be less based on your professors) and we could allocate an extra 6 hours for HW and studying.

To recap, that is 12 hours per week for school, 14.25 hours per week for your part time job. That's still less time than you spent in high school each week.

You next thought is ""but then I'm going to Community College and State School."" Yes! That is awesome. You are going to college at a fraction of the price of many of your cohorts. In fact, you could get a graduate degree after your undergrad degree for less than one year of their tuition. Also, we are now living in a world where it really doesn't matter where you went to school. Some brand names will always matter, but with most schools and most degrees, nobody cares. Your employer cares that you can do your job well using your education.

And besides, I'd rather have my affordable degree instead of more than 300k crushing debt and theassociated stress after you start factoring interest. 250k debt, at 10%, is $25,000 per year in INTEREST. HOLY CRAP!

Your final thought is ""but the college experience!!??"" So, like, um, about that $220,000 you just saved by commuting to school... You can get a lot of hookers and blow for that (or whatever). There is also a pretty big psychological benefit to having that ""safety net"" of being near loved ones.

Now, there are a few caveats. Many young people have other expenses, so they'll have to work more. But again, living a subsidized life, even paying light rent, it's not impossible to work those 14.25 hours per week (again, at minimum wage). Also, taking the part-time education route may cost a grand or two more over the degree. Colleges tack on all sorts of fees for full-time students, but part time students will pay a bit more per class. It's worth evaluating.

Maybe college isn't for you. That's fair, but you probably need some sort of formal training or education for whatever you do want to do, and you should consider alternative routes instead of financing with an unsecured student loan.

Finally, there are many young people who simply cannot live with their parents any longer. This can be for any number of reasons. If life hasn't dealt you a full deck, that stinks. You can still do the whole education thing if you take your time and have a good emergency fund (read the wiki if you don't know what I'm talking about). Most colleges allow somewhere around 10 years before the classes ""expire"" from a credit standpoint.

Good luck, and save hard. See you next time for my next PSA ;)

Tl;Dr: If you are considering a traditional collegiate education, consider making it affordable.",finance,1451310993

personalfinance,"Need help paying off $126,000 in Student Loans","Hey Everyone,

So I have a ton of student debt that I need to pay off and I am really nervous about how much debt I had accumulated. Most of the loans are from private loans and then about $30,000 of the loans are Federal Loans. 

The loan interest rate average is 8.5%. I was thinking about doing a loan refinance through a company like Sofi. It says that the interest rates can be as low as 3%. 

Ideally, I'd like to pay off my loans in 10 years but I don't even know if that's possible. I really need a plan to get rid of all this debt. 

I am 23 and I just graduated college.  I was fortunate enough to immediately get a job. I make around $70,000 a year. My take home paycheck every two weeks is around $1,700 because I contribute 6% to my 401k. I don't pay rent because I live with my parents. The following is an estimate of my expenses:

* Gym - $125 (It's a lot because I have a boxing gym that is $99 a month and a weightlifting gym that is $35)
* Groceries - $160
* Gas - $80
* Phone - $40
* Eating Out - $100

I really don't go out much so my expenses aren't too high. I mainly spend money on food and fitness. I just started my job so I really haven't gotten a good look at what my true budgets will be with this pay but I don't think I'll change my spending habbits at all. 

What do you all suggest I do so I can pay this student loan debt?

personalfinance,"Questions on inheritance I'm maybe, sort of getting.","Since my grandfather died about 8 years ago I have been told that money was put in trust for my two brothers and I. My grandmother recently passed and now that appears to not have been the case, there were not separate accounts for my brothers and I. What I have been told by my father and aunt is that it was ""her wishes"" that my brothers and I get some money but we were not specifically named. (I have not seen the actual will yet; probably will this weekend.) So my father is setting up accounts for my brothers and I with $50k in each but with some kind of custodianship. 

Questions:

1. Does there need to be a separate account in order for brothers and I to inherit directly?

2. Do we need to be specifically named or can there be a general ""my grandchildren""? 

3. What if grandfather's will named us specifically but grandmother's did not? 

4. Taxes. I understand that because the estate is below the state and federal limit there should be no taxes on the funds, but people in my family are confused about whether this means receiving the money or using the money, which makes no sense to me. Say I inherited an account with $50k in mutual funds and bonds, (or in my father's case ~$500k) are there tax implications for selling some holdings and withdrawing the money to do something, anything? 

5. Assuming what my father and aunt have said is all true and correct, (I don't think they have any nefarious motives, I just think they don't ask questions and make assumptions,) how can I make use of that $50k and minimize tax implications? Should my dad begin gifting $14k per year to each of us so that in 5 years we would have access to the full amount? Could he also gift my mother (not named or referred to in the will AFAik) a larger amount and have her do yearly gifts so that my brothers and I could access the money sooner? 



For me, the money will likely be used as part of a down payment on a home sometime in the next 3-5 years. I may fritter away $2-3k on a nice trip for my gf and I.

Primary home, purchased at $385k 3 years ago, current balance at $343k. Not an FHA. Comps are near $500k. Interested in getting the PMI removed based on current home value. When I contacted the mortgage company to inquire, they sent me paperwork but nowhere does it state that it can be dropped based on current market value.  What's the truth? Do I have to wait until my loan value is 80% of LTV based on ORIGINAL purchase price or can I qualify based on market price by requesting an appraisal? Here's what the paperwork reads the bank sent me. I've called them multiple times but I keep getting goons, unless I'm the goon who refuses to take their answers.


Nationstar follows the federal requirements for borrower-requested cancellation of private mortgage insurance (PMI), as found in the Homeowner’s Protection Act of 1998. The requirements are as follows:
1. You must submit a written request for cancellation. Please use the form that is attached.
2. The loan to value (LTV) ratio of your loan must be equal to, or less than, 80%. LTV is calculated by dividing the unpaid principal balance of your loan by the lesser of the sales price or the original appraised value of your property at loan origination.
3. The property which is the collateral for the loan must be a Single Family Residence (including condos) and must be occupied by the owner.
4. The loan may not have a Late Charge balance (this restriction only applies if the owner of your loan is Fannie Mae).
5. The loan must be current.
6. You must have a good payment history on the loan, which means:
a. No monthly payments were more than 30 days delinquent in the last 12 months.
b. No monthly payments were more than 60 days delinquent in the last 24 months.
7. You must certify that there are no subordinate liens on the property which would
cause the LTV to be greater than 80%.
8. The value of your property must not have declined below the original value of the
property (i.e., the value of the property at the time the loan was made). Nationstar requires an appraisal to show the value has not declined. Please note that Nationstar will order the appraisal; however, the cost of the appraisal is your responsibility.",finance,1451323272

personalfinance,HR screwed up my retirement contributions. What are my options?,"I work for the federal government and have a TSP account. Back in late November, I switched my TSP contributions to 100% traditional TSP in order to contribute the maximum amount possible for the last two pay periods of 2015. I received e-mail notifications showing that they received my request for the change and that it would take effect on the pay period beginning November 29th. There were also documents uploaded to my EOPF (a web HR tool we have) showing the changes to my TSP contributions. 


Around mid December, HR sends out an email to everyone about TSP limits for next year as well as information about how much we need to contribute to max out our contributions for 2016. Since changes to contributions do not take effect until the start of the next pay period, we could make changes after December 14th for them to take effect on the very first pay period of 2016. I decided to go ahead and modify my TSP contributions in order to ensure I can make the maximum contributions next year. 


When I log into mypay (our payroll website) and try to modify my contributions I noticed that somehow my traditional contribution is only set to 10% and not 100%. I immediately email HR (this was around December 15th) and tell them of the error. They email me back saying they cannot even find me in the system and to send them my SSN. I send them that and blah blah they can't find me in the mypay system but they do see me in some other system and it shows my contributions being set to 100% still. They said they would open a ticket with dfas but that it can take up to 14 days. On December 18th, our paychecks were processed and of course only 10% was deducted for TSP. I e-mailed HR back and they basically just said they are still waiting on dfas. 


They only possible explanation that makes any sense to me is that some HR person saw that I was set to 100% and they probably assumed it was an error and took it upon themselves to adjust it to 10% without consulting me. To be honest, I have absolutely no faith in our HR. They are notoriously slow for processing everything. I personally have been waiting over 2 months for them to process my promotion paperwork for a target/ladder promotion. Are they required to correct this or is this something that I could potentially just get screwed on? Is there anyway I can escalate this up the chain or should I just wait for our HR to find out something from dfas?",finance,1451353652

I know the cars rates are lower than the student loans but since I have to pay on those every month I can't really pay off as much I would prefer. 

My plan was to use the extra money I have to pay off 0% debts first. 9k of the student loan debt is 7.2% from a private loan. Should I pay off this or one of the cars to give me more cash flow to pay off more debt? I know I should probably pay off the student loans first because of the higher interest rates. I was thinking 6k car then 9k student loan because the monthly payment on car is higher and then I could use the extra money on the student loan once I have that car paid off.

1) Open secured credit card with current insurance company, they deposit the securing funds in a CD that gets a fairly low interest rate over the 2 years of the accounts life.  Some interest is better than no interest, and I'm only interested in opening the line of credit to establish creditworthyness for auto and home loans in the future.

3) Secure a home loan upon closing of my auto loan (3-4yrs in the future)

I screwed myself over in 2012 by skipping out on a cable bill/equipment charge in KS. There are 2 accounts in collection in relation to this, I can pay them off in a week or two depending on work conditions as I'm not willing to forgo finally building savings after being briefly homeless.

personalfinance,Balancing Debt vs. Emergency Fund Saving,"I would love to get some different perspectives on the topic of balancing emergency fund savings versus paying down debt and/or investing. Here is our current situation: 

- We have about $12,000 in student loan debt at a low interest rate (3%). This is our only debt. The monthly payment is $200
- We have about $20k in our emergency fund and another $5k in a car fund (we contribute to this on a monthly basis but won't need a new car for another 3-4 years, barring a disaster). 
- We contribute ~15% of our gross income to our 401ks and fully fund our Roth IRAs. We have room to contribute another $15k per year to our 401ks before we hit our yearly limit 
- We own our home with a 35 year old furnace - might need to be replaced in the next couple of years, or tomorrow if it blows up (~6k)
- We have about $1,200-$1,500 per month extra to pay down debt, put towards our emergency fund, etc. 

My question is, should we:

1) go ahead and just write a check for our remaining student loan balance, even if this leaves us with only $13,000 in savings (approximately 2-3 months of expenses?) 
2) complete our 6-month emergency fund ($30,000) before paying down the student loan debt
3) continue paying minimum monthly payments, finish our emergency fund, and add additional funds to our 401k?

I'm one step away from financing my loans with SoFi at 15 years, 3.105% variable. My current student loans balance is:
$110,000 @ 7.5%
$40,000 @ 4.375%

I'm only looking to refinance the sequence @ 7.5%, since the other set has a decent fixed rate. I'm choosing 15 years since it gives me a total payment between both loans ~$1000/mo. I can afford more, and plan to prepay to the tune of $2000 a month, but since mortgages are concerned with debt to income ratio on a monthly basis, I figured it was best to keep this number is low as possible. Other rates in eligible for are 2.705% at 10yr and 3.305% at 20yr. I can also do a fixed rate of about 5%. 

I really want to knock these out but don't want to jeopardize my ability to get a mortgage in a few years. I'm thinking of paying the min on the 4.375% loans and maxing out the soon to be private 3.105% loans, as it is variable and could go higher if I'm unlucky. I know this goes against common practice of paying off the highest interest first. 

Does this sound kosher to everyone? Would you choose fixed over variable? Would you choose a different term? Would you also refinance the federal @4.375 fixed? Any other thoughts I'm not considering?

personalfinance,Pay off work truck or save for house?,"Good morning all!

I have been brooding on what is the best course of action for my situation and decided to see what the good folks of reddit have to say.
I am currently paying down debts and looking to buy my first home in the next year. In the past 4 months I have managed to pay down about $12k in credit card debt and save about $3k. I want to save up to about $20k in the next 6-12 months, which should be reasonable despite a downturn where I live.

I consulted a mortgage broker in the summer and she said to get approved I would need about 20 for the price I had in mind and have the card paid down. I also had a work truck for a side business snow plowing which currently owes about $16k.  She said that sum was fine.

Since then I have been given a 1 year lease on a brand new car that actually makes me money (car allowance is $70 more than car payment) so this would be a good replacement of my debt servicing compared to the truck.

My question is, should I throw all my pennies at paying off the snow plow now that I have a different loan, or should I save for the down payment in time for house buying season this coming year in the spring?

Some extra details about the truck: I pay 228.59 biweekly, at 4.99%. It only makes money from November to April, and it will not make much this season due to El Nino  ( around 8k this season?) . Paying it off will free up $500/ month which is nice, especially at such a high interest rate, but I won't see that money back until either next season or when I decide to sell it in 2-3 years.

personalfinance,Can I afford a condo?,"I have another rent vs. buy conundrum I’ve been mulling over for the last couple weeks. I’ve read through several articles and used the New York Times Rent Vs. Buy Calculator but wanted to get a little more input. Here’s where I stand financially at the moment:


* $17,809 Savings with 0.88% APY
* $13,504 Checking with 0.06% APY
* $62,301 General Investing
* $30,816 Roth IRA (Maxing out 5500K every year
* $100K+ in TSP (Maxing out 18K every year)

The $17K in savings started off as my emergency fund / vacation fund. I was putting $250 per paycheck into this account for a while and now I just let it grow even though I’ve met my goal. I estimate my emergency fund needs to be $12K for 1 year and even that is probably overkill. If I were to lose my job tomorrow, I’d move out of my current apartment and back in with my parents until I found another job. The rest of that account was supposed to be used for vacations. I travel a lot for work which nets me airline miles and hotel points. I use these for my vacations so even my 2-3 weeks of personal travel abroad this year was well under $1000 total.

I usually keep my checking account around $5K. I’m due to move some of that into my general investing account. My general investing is basically because I don’t know what else to do with that money. I started it as a 5-7 year house fund. I’m now at year 4. I’ve always assumed that I would not be able to afford a house in my area so I might as well invest aggressively while I’m young (I’m almost 28).

I have a 7 year old car which has been rock-solid for me. It has around 128K miles on it. I have no plans of buying a new car anytime soon but I expect part of the emergency fund may be used in the upcoming years for repairs.

Currently I work for the federal government and my salary next year is projected to be $90K. My position is extremely stable and I have been receiving the max raises for the last 4 years (not that I should count on continuing to receive them). I typically earn about $10K in overtime per year but I have not included that in my projected salary. I also save about 20% of my per diem from travel which is also not included in my projected salary. These savings usually work their way into my general investing fund every couple months. I currently have no plans of leaving my current position. However, if another federal job comes up in an area of the country I want to move to, I would probably take it. Right now I cannot guarantee either way if I will be living in the same area in 3,5, or 7 years.

My current rent is $750 and I pay around $200 on average a month for utilities. I ended up taking home around $1500 every two weeks.

The problem arises when I start looking at condos in my area. One of my requirements is I must be within 20 minutes of work during rush hour and within 20 minutes of the climbing gym I use. These are the two places I go to pretty much every day so I want to minimize the amount of time I spend driving on a daily basis. This means that the average cost of a two bedroom condo is between $200 and 400K. Given this and my relatively cheap rent, it seems that I should continue to rent. However, I live in an area with several federal facilities which means there are always people looking to rent. Finding a place to move into required visiting and signing the lease the day it was listed. I’m fairly confident I can find a roommate to cut the costs with.

According to my research, a 30 year mortgage on 250K is approximately $1600 per month or 49% of my take home salary. This does not include utilities or HOA fees which I estimate to be $300-$500 a month. I think this means I could technically afford this while still contributing $18K to my TSP but possibly taking a hit on my Roth contributions. If this were the end of the story I’d probably lean towards continuing to rent until I find my sugar-mama.

However, this is where my math gets fuzzy. The apartment buildings I have been looking at often rent rooms at $1100-$1300 per month. With a roommate, now they are covering the majority of the mortgage payment and splitting utilities with me. Now I’m looking at $500 per month on the mortgage and $250 for utilities.

So I guess what I’m wondering is, should I continue looking for a condo to buy or are they still outside of my price range given my current situation? If I can buy, am I correct in assuming that 250K is my maximum?",finance,1451418436

---

I know I could be reducing my variable expenses, and I usually try to live
frugally, but I also appreciate the value of compromise. So I do sometimes
indulge the money I earn, but not at the expense of major financial detriment.

---

**Specific question:** Overall, I'm pretty happy with my current finances, given my background and
current location. I am unsure, however, about the $6k owed to my old school.
I'm reluctant to budget any significant portion of my income towards paying it
off, primarily because there's no interest, and it's not being reported to the
credit bureaus. I see no immediate financial gain to paying it off now, when I
could wait until my income is higher (hopefully) in the future and pay it
off then. I'm also secretly hoping that the school will go under or forget
about me (though I know it's incredibly unlikely) and I no longer have to pay
it off. I went there for one semester and quit because the school sucked and I
realized that classroom learning is not my style. I don't relish the idea of
giving them money for something I didn't get any benfit from.


---

My future is also very hazy. I'm 100% sure that I'm leaving NYC in 2016 (preferably by spring), but I
would be able to keep my current job and salary and work remotely wherever I
end up. I'm also unsure if my SO and I are going to be together much longer.
Luckily, our finances aren't too converged. Besides a joint checking account
(for shared bills and rent), the only thing we ""share"" is that she cosigned
the vehicle loan, but I could refinance that if required now that my credit
score is higher.

If we do end up separating, I think I would likely be selling my motorcycle
and whatever other stuff I don't need and don't want to store, financing a car
(likely a Subaru WRX), and leaving NYC on a long-term road trip to find a new
place to live (my employer would likely allow that to happen, assuming I can
maintain a semi-regular work schedule). I don't think that would be feasible
unless I can work (and maintain an income) during the trip. I've done the math, and with my current income I can sustain an on-the-road lifestyle indefinitely and still save money. I'd essentially be trading rent/utilities for fuel/tolls, car maintenance, car payment, and mildly more expensive food. I'll likely be camping/couchsurfing as much as I can, but I'm sure I'll get a motel/hostel sometimes.

So since I don't have a solid plan for my immediate future, I've been trying
to save as much capital as I can (I will be tightening down more starting
Jan), minimize new expenses, and keep my financial goals generic.

I'm considering doing a balance transfer to pay as much as the Discover balance off before the interest kicks in on that card (which will also be around 18%). Will this effect my credit at all? Does it count as a new debt or not because it's a transfer?  This will max out the BoA card.

personalfinance,"Getting a lump some of money, how should I pay off my debt?","Hi,

Here is my debt situation:

| Credit Card   | Amount On    | Interest Rate     |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| Credit Union |  2500 |    9.9%     
| Capital One  |   3226|  22.9% 
| Tires Plus       |  1026| 22.8%

I'm getting 12000 as a bonus from work - and I have the above debt. Now some of that money has been earmarked for a down payment for my wife on a new vehicle (hers is falling apart and we're having a baby), and paying off a couch we financed. 

So here's the breakdown of the 12000:

| Amount   | Going Towards   
|:-----------|------------:|
| 6000        |  Car 
| 2000  |   Savings
| 1800      |  Couch

That leaves about 2000 towards the above credit cards. Should I completely pay off the tires plus credit card? Should I make three 700 dollar payments? What's the best way to pay down those three credit cards to fastest help my credit.

personalfinance,student loan forbearance as a way to save money more quickly for a mortgage downpayment?,"girlfriend and I want to buy a house in 2016, and in an effort to save more money for a downpayment I'm considering putting my student loans into forbearance. By doing so I would have the opportunity to save around $2400 over the course of 6 months. The interest rates on my loans varies between 3 and 6%. 

My thinking here is that the value the $2400 provides to me as someone saving for a house in a very expensive market is greater than the additional cost of interest gained on that $2400 over the next 6 months. 

I'm curious if anyone has done this before and has had any issues with being approved for loans when you have loans marked as being in forbearance on your credit report?",finance,1451424405
personalfinance,Just received a $10k gift for Christmas. Looking to save for a house over the next couple years. Does my budget look sane?,"My in-laws gave my wife and I a $10,000 check in our Christmas card last week. We're only children and they know we're working towards a house, so this is 100% a ""kickstarter"" for our future. We're amazingly lucky in that both of us have awesome parents and no petty family politics.

We're hoping to make a house purchase in the next 2-3 years, if possible. We can wait longer, if need be.  

I use YNAB and have for a couple years. I have 3 months of expenses saved up right now as an emergency fund and save money every month for medical and automotive needs/maintenance. 

I was hoping to get some input on my general budget.

**Jobs:** I currently gross $46,100, likely to bump to $47,300 in July. If I get a bump in my pay grade (performance review) I would see a gross salary of $50,550 by the end of the year. I'm not counting on either of these raises though. They'd be bonuses, basically, as far as my savings goals go. 

My wife doesn't have a regular job right now, partly due to chronic migraines. If it became financially necessary, she could pick up part time work, but for now we're comfortable enough. She and her mom have a small business, though, but nothing that has a significant impact on us in terms of taxes/income (so she needs a car for that, otherwise we would cut the gas/insurance for her).

**Debt:** No credit card debt and our cars are paid off. I do have student loan debt, but I am a public employee on Income Based Repayment, so my loans will be forgiven tax free in about 7 years. I plan to stay a public employee for the rest of my career.

**Budget:** As I said, I use YNAB. Using PaycheckCity's calculator I should net about $2,336/mo. This is with 2015 tax tables so that could change slightly.

Here's my sketched out budget:

Some categories say ""occasional"" meaning that sometimes I'll tweak expenses a bit to make a little room for a night out or to buy a PS4/computer game. 

The mattress is from when I took advantage of a 0% financing offer. I could have laid down all the cash at once, but decided to spread it out instead. I'll have it paid off a month ahead of time. That $50/mo will then go to House. 

Lastly, $250 on gas isn't necessarily how much we spend, I just plugged that in there. I drive 5-10 miles a day, my wife about 25. I like to have more money in the gas fund than necessary (total of $400-500) so we have a buffer against price spikes and/or unexpected travel needs. 

Assuming nothing too crazy happens, with monthly savings alone I should be able to set aside $2,900-$3,000. Add in those three paycheck months for an additional ~$2,400-2,500 and I'm looking at saving $5,500.

***IF*** I get those pay increases, I'm looking at roughly $200 more a month net - every penny of which would go towards house savings. As I said though, I'm not counting on that. If I were to get the raise though, I'd be able to pack away $8k in 2017.

So in theory over 2016 and 2017 I could put away about $13,000-13,500. 

When added to the $12,000 I already have, I'd have $25,000 or so, in addition to any other side money I put in the emergency fund.

Is that a reasonable amount to have when looking for a house in the $100,000-125,000 range?",finance,1451424459

personalfinance,Any downside to doing IBR with the intention of using the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Details inside.,"Edit: I just saw that there was another question related to PSLF today - but I don't have money like the other poster does.  I only have a few thousand in savings.

I'm 24 (and single) and I graduated in May with a masters degree and about $90k in student loan debt.  All of my loans are direct federal loans (Stafford subsidized and unsubsidized and Graduate PLUS) and are from both undergrad and grad school.

I started my current job in August and am making $58k/year.  I applied for IBR in October and, after a short forbearance while my loan servicer was processing my paperwork, made my first payment of $336 in December.

I'm a librarian and work for a public university.  My particular ""specialty"" means that I will likely continue working at large public universities for much of my career and particularly over the next ten years, so I'm pretty sure I will qualify for [PSFL](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) after making 10 years of monthly payments.

So as of right now, my plan is to just continue making the IBR payments and keeping up to date on any news about the program that would cause me to change my plans.  As is expected with IBR, this is a completely manageable plan - obviously I'd rather have the part of my income that is going to paying off my loans as savings or disposable income, but I can easily make the payments.

I guess I'm asking because I'm worried I should be paying more.  I mean, my loans are sitting there gathering interest.  But paying more than the IBR payment would just mean I pay more than I have to in the long run.  It would reduce the debt I'm carrying, but I'm not sure what I should do.

I don't have any other debt - I got my first credit cards after starting my current job and have so far been paying them off consistently, my car is paid for, etc.

Any advice is appreciated.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that my parents are planning to give me $2k/year for the next 5 years because our original agreement was that they would pay for most of undergrad (which they did...mostly out of pocket at the time).  My parents tend to be good with money and true to their word but I don't think it would break me if they weren't able to do this as planned.  Right now I'm planning on just putting this money into a savings account on top of my budding emergency fund because my monthly loan payment is already in my budget as if that money didn't exist.  Should I be doing something else with this money when I receive it, though?

If it helps, this is how it breaks down:

Direct Unsubsidized Stafford:

What are my options to proceed without causing more damage to my credit?

I am able to make payments, but I am not sure of how to set that up, or with whom (as the loans have gone to collection), and I know that saying certain things while communicating with collections can bind me legally (or something), and I want to have a clearer path forward.

The loan is technically 5 separate loans all from the Direct Loan Program, varying from $1,100 to $1,760 +interest.

I know this isn't the overwhelming tens of thousands that some owe, but I am lost on what to do, and, as a current student, this impedes me from borrowing any more, which is not my primary goal, but a circumstance in which I will need to borrow may arise in future semesters.

The first mortgage was $220K, 30yr fixed at 5.75%. 
The second mortgage was $25k, second 30/15 at 8.625%.

So I wanted to get some suggestions on my family financial/investment situation. My wife's company offers a ESPP that would allow her to contribute up to the $25,000 federal maximum for purchase in employee stock. I wanted to know if you guys think this is a good idea given our present financial situation. 

ESPP Program Specifics: 
You may elect to participate in one or both of the two separate
“purchase right periods” for each year (both apply to the $25k yearly max):
a) January 1 through December 31, or
b) July 1 through December 31

During the year, you set money aside to purchase stock at the
end of the year. You may set money aside:
– Through after-tax payroll deductions of a certain amount
each pay period
– Through a lump-sum deposit
– Through a combination of both

HOWEVER, stock is purchased ONLY on DECEMBER 31 at the LESSER of

a) The closing price on the first day of the purchase right period
(i.e. January 1 or July 1), or
b) 15% off the closing price on December 31.

Your shares will be issued to a book entry account in your name within 45 days after your purchase on December 31. I WOULD SELL THE SHARES ASAP TO LIMIT EXPOSURE.

investing,ESPP Question,"Hey everyone, 

So I wanted to get some suggestions on my family financial/investment situation. My wife's company offers a ESPP that would allow her to contribute up to the $25,000 federal maximum for purchase in employee stock. I wanted to know if you guys think this is a good idea given our present financial situation. 

ESPP Program Specifics: 
You may elect to participate in one or both of the two separate
“purchase right periods” for each year (both apply to the $25k yearly max):
a) January 1 through December 31, or
b) July 1 through December 31

During the year, you set money aside to purchase stock at the
end of the year. You may set money aside:
– Through after-tax payroll deductions of a certain amount
each pay period
– Through a lump-sum deposit
– Through a combination of both

HOWEVER, stock is purchased ONLY on DECEMBER 31 at the LESSER of

a) The closing price on the first day of the purchase right period
(i.e. January 1 or July 1), or
b) 15% off the closing price on December 31.

Your shares will be issued to a book entry account in your name within 45 days after your purchase on December 31. I WOULD SELL THE SHARES ASAP TO LIMIT EXPOSURE. 

My wife and I both make ~55,000/year gross. I contribute to a 401k (just enough to receive employer match) but her work does not offer a 401k match, we both max out or ROTH IRAs. Our expenses are low enough that I believe we could contribute the full $25,000 for the ESPP program however it would be tight. My questions are 

1. Should we consider contributing to the 25k match? (Large portion of our net income ~35%)
2. Should we not start until the July 1 purchase right period so the money would be held up for 6 months instead of 1 year?
3. The 45 day lag time scares me however, given the 15% discount I would hope that would be enough to protect against sudden market drops.",finance,1451481297
personalfinance,Upside Down on Auto Loan. How to Proceed?,"Hi All. I purchased a 2010 Kia Forte in January of 2014. I got the car for almost exactly the KBB price of around 10,000. The car only had 35,000 miles on it. My credit was in the toilet at that point and I had to take on a 23% interest rate. I knew it was that or a Buy Here Pay Here type deal that I was not okay doing. I got a 2 year warranty, and after taxes and fees my loan was at ~12,300. My payments are $330/mo. and only $140/mo. touches the principal. It's only down to about $10,200.

My situation is that I have greatly increased my credit score (~140 pts.) and when speaking with a dealer where I bought my car I could get a loan as low as 5.9% interest if I traded in my car for a new car. However, they only offered me $6,000 for my trade in. This number is completely fair, as that is around the KBB trade in. If I go with the newer car, I'll be paying principal but with a higher payment (~$30 more) and insurance will go higher. I like my car and had no desire to trade in until I realized how badly under water I am with this, and seemingly no chance of fixing it. The chances of refinancing are out the window since I owe so much more than it is worth. Do I continue paying on my current loan? Do I trade in and start another HUGE loan again?

personalfinance,"New 20 Something Lawyer, Decent Paying job, but Lots of Debt. Help!","Just came upon this resource, and so far it has been outstanding to read through all of the great advice. I was hoping I could harvest a little of that great advice for my situation. 

Below please find my (1) personal situation section, and (2) my personal financial situation. Any and all advice is very much appreciated. 

Personal situation: 

I am in my early 20’s. Although in about a year I’ll be in my mid 20’s. I am not a lawyer yet! Although, I am a third year law student; I graduate with a law degree this May, I will take and hopefully pass the bar in July, 2016. I am in about the middle of my class in regard to grades, and I attend a law school ranked within the top 25 in the country. Obviously I have a bachelor’s degree; it was from a more modest undergrad though. I am also an enlisted veteran of the Marine Corps. I served four years on active duty; I am currently using the Gi-Bill. I am also an officer in one of the military reserve branches, more on this below. I am married; my wife is an undergraduate student. My wife works part time, I am a full time law student. 

Personal Financial Information:  
  
(A) $167,046.00 total student loan debt (all fed loans undergrad &amp; law) The very little that I have from undergrad is subsidized. I am not currently in repayment, but will be in approx. 10 months, including the grace period. 
(B) $24,250 Total credit card debt (3 Cards Total. 1 Card was a refinance one, it has 0% APR until 3/2017, it is maxed right now at 5K. The other two have pretty high interest. And about 15K more of credit left combined.
(C) I have two car loans, my wife’s car (I’m a cosigner), which she usually pays from part time work, and my car. My car note is: $6,064. With 3.5% interest. I have a 2012 VW Passat TDI. She has a 2012 VW Jetta, and that Note is $13,500 Approx. with 4% interest. Both of our cars are fairly reliable and have about 50K miles on them.
(D) Mortgage: Is $350 a month, which includes tax and Insurance. The Mortgage is about 4% on a 50K total loan. It is a VA mortgage. I plan on renting this house through a property management company once I start work full time. I am expecting $1200 a month in rent. It is a 3 bedroom 2.5 bath house in the South. Local property management company takes 10% of rental income to watch over the investment and collect rent from the tenants. 
(E) Unsecured Loans: (1) Home remodel loan, $4,000 (17.75% APR) (2) Kay Credit, Total $2,500. No interest until 10/2016.
(F) We do not have any kids. 
(G) My credit is average I’d say. My “transunion” score is 624, and my “Equifax” is 609. I have never made a single late payment. All of my accounts are perfect. So my low score is a direct result of high debt/income ratio, and perhaps low age of accounts. I have a long credit history with a total of about 100 accounts open/&amp; closed.  

Salary and benefits Information:

I was hired by one of the military branches to be a military attorney. I am currently a reserve, but will transition to active duty this summer some time. My pay and benefits start sometime this summer as well. So I will start getting paid right after the Bar exam.
(A) Total taxable salary is: $63,446.40 yearly. That is pay grade 03E for 2015.
(B) Also include in taxable income a potential $1000 approx. monthly for rental property. Could be a little more or less here. $1000 is a good guess though. 
(C) Total un-taxed housing allowance $27,720 yearly. $2,310 monthly, 03E With Dependents. This is based on a northeastern base location. Although the amount doesn’t vary that much based on other locations I could be. 
(D) Total BAS allowance (for sustenance), un-taxed: $253.63 a month. $3,043.56 for the year.
(E) 100% free health care and dental for my wife and I. We have no children.
(F) My wife is an undergrad student. She will not likely have substantial or consistent income for a while. 
(G) I have about $5000 in savings. I also have about $1000 in long term stocks. My stocks are doing great and could sell all them right now at a profit. 

Financial Summary: Total yearly income before taxes is: $106,209.96. I will likely be a military attorney for at least the next 8 years. The next 4 years minimum because that is what my current employment contract is for. My salary after I leave the military should be easily $140k plus. 


Potential current plan: 

For the student loans, sign up for PAYE or IBR; either will keep my loan payments as low as possible until I can use Public Service Loans Forgiveness (PSLF) 10 years down the road. Wife and I will file taxes separately so I can lower my AGI. Also, I will have my wife pay taxes for rental income to lower my AGI, which should lower student loan repayments. Also, contribute max amount to TSP/IRA to also lower AGI  by $18,000.

gaming,"So, Reddit, what are some of your best/most memorable moments in gaming?","I'm talking single player, multiplayer, first person shooters, puzzle games, RTS, racing, simulation, whatever. Let us know what game it is and why it was so awesome. 

This post in particular was inspired by a comment I made in /r/homeworld regarding my first online experience with the game, included below. 

My first experience with Homeworld online went as follows:

I had convinced my friend to download the demo of HW2 when the game launched. I already owned the game, but was trying to convince my friend to get it. He'd never played the HW series before, but is quite good at RTS in general. 

So we start up the game and I start building my fleet. But, this being my friend's first time in this game, I'm in no rush to get anything up that fast. 

Big mistake. Fifteen minutes in, I've got a whole flotilla popping up on long range sensors. He skipped my resourcing operation and was going right for the kill. And here I was taking my time, so I have less than half of what he's got. Well shit. 

That's when my hyperdirve finished. So I docked all my ships with my mothership, wished my friend a fond farewell, and jumped to the zenith of the map. Since he'd left my resourcing op alone, I still had income. I used this reprieve to build a fleet. Every time he found me, I'd jump away before his fleet could arrive and pin me down with his gravity well generator. 

Fed up with my tactics, my friend filled the sector with probes. Total sensor coverage. Nowhere for me to hide. 

But I wasn't worried. My fleet was complete. I was ready. As his probe arrived at my mothership, I told my friend there was one final hyperspace jump incoming. He started laughing at me until the hyperspace exit animation for thirty-odd ships appeared behind his mothership. His fleet was in a holding pattern about a third of the distance  across the map. Even with hyperspace, that's just too far. My ion cannons tore into his mothership while I focused my bombers on first his hyperdrive to prevent his escape from me, then his engines, just to make sure he knew it was game. His fleet arrived just in time for the final, spectacular explosion of his mothership.",technology,1451495669

Bitcoin,Shower thought: A metric to measure decentralization &amp; censorship resistance,"Lately, u/jtoomim has published some very interesting data about mining pools owning their hashpower (see https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ygu5d/blocksize_consensus_census/cydpxaa). These data plus a discussion about hashpower liquidity (http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/012112.html) gave me the idea of a metric allowing to better quantify decentralization &amp; censorship resistance.



Basically, the idea is:


- Order mining pools in decreasing order according to the hashpower directly owned by the mining pool

- Check how many pools are required to reach the 51% threshold. This number is our metric.


According to jtoomim's data, the current score is 5 (chart =&gt; http://imgur.com/Bjo0ri5)


**Rationale**


This metric represents the minimum number of entities which should be ""coerced"" in order to start a 51% attack and censorship of transactions. Note that different threshold values may be used.


**Observations**


- Values for this metric are on scale from 1 to (0.51 * nb_full_nodes):


  - 1 corresponds to the case of a 51% attack performed by an actor owning more than 51% of total hashpower


  - ""0.51 * nb_full_nodes"" corresponds to the case of a fully decentralized network (all full nodes are independant mining nodes and hashpower is evenly distributed).


- Some mining pools are open to external miners but they also own a part of the hashpower. The problem is that it's difficult/impossible to get a reliable estimation of this part. Therefore, without additional information, this metric should be seen as a upper bound/optimistic view of the ""real"" value.


**Limitations**


- Obviously, 5 mining pools in a same country isn't the same as 5 mining pools in 5 different countries. 


- Moreover, 5 mining pools with 10,2% each isn't the same as a pool with 50% and 4 pools with 0.25%.
This fine grained information provided by the distribution of hashpower is lost when using this single metric which ""compresses"" the information embedded in the initial distribution.



This metric is far from perfect but I think it may be useful to characterize mining decentralization, especially when used to compare bitcoin with others systems or idealized models. Let me give you two examples.


**Satoshi's vision**


During the debate about the block size limit, Satoshi's vision was cited many times by all parties.


&gt; The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate. (07/2010)


&gt; I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions. At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN. (07/2010)


A very important point (often misunderstood by commenters) is that in Satoshi's lingo, a full node is an independant mining node.


So, when Satoshi writes about 100k nodes running in data centers, he talks about 100k independant mining nodes (not 100k validating nodes).


Considering that he wrote ""probably less"" it's fair to assume that his vision goes from 10k nodes (one order of magnitude less than his estimation) to 100k nodes.


Assuming an evenly distributed hashpower, that give us a range for the max value of the decentralization score corresponding to Satoshi's vision: somewhere between 5.1k and 51k independant mining nodes. For the record, current value is 5.


**Permissioned blockchains**

This one may sound like pure trolling but if we really believe in the value of bitcoin, we must agree to compare this value to alternative solutions. Let's have a thought experiment and let's imagine that R3 has a working implementation of a permissioned federated blockchain with all members (banks) participating to the validation.
With 42 banks that would give us a decentralization score equal to 22.
Yes, I know that it hurts (at least, it hurts me). On the ""bright side"", R3 doesn't have a working implementation and we don't know the rules which will be followed by this system... for now.
Moreover, an exhaustive benchmark would require to compare the financial costs associated to the systems.


**Conclusion**


This post isn't intended to troll the bitcoin community (if it was the case, it would be a post on r/buttcoin).
I'm convinced that we, as a community, must decide why we hire bitcoin (tm Trace Mayer) and work hard towards this goal. 
For this, objective metrics are needed. This is a humble proposal for all those interested in bitcoin as a decentralized and censorship resistant network. 
Comments, critics, improvements or different models are welcome !

personalfinance,"Credit Card Debt (Multiple cards, low amounts)","Hi there, Long time redditor, I am using a throwaway because of personal financial business. Could use a little advice here. I do visit this sub frequently, have read the sidebar and done quite a bit of research on my own.  I am hoping to get some direct advice from some neutral parties that I can show my SO, because my advice has not been heeded.



My (36F)  long time SO (34M)  (13 years together, own a house together) has some credit card debt. Not a huge amount; ~$2k. This debt is spread over about 6 cards, for the past 5+ years.  From what I understand, the amounts due on the cards are pretty low, around a $200-$500 each. He has NOT been sent to collections on any of them. The interest rates on all of them are quite high.



He has been paying the minimum amounts on these cards for years, and that is not getting him anywhere.  He is afraid to stop paying any of them, in order to pay off another. His credit score has actually been going up since he makes regular payments.



We do have a detailed budget. We share mortgage/shared expenses based on a sliding scale of percentage based on our take-home salary. Me 63% him 37%.  He is able to contribute on his end for the bills, but is unable to save ANY money whatsoever for emergencies, or our future. A recent emergency car repair on his end has made him realize how dire his situation is, with zero money saved for such incidents.

Couple of important points:

- I will not loan him any money to pay off his debts

- he has not been sent to collections for any of these credit cards

- he has nothing in savings. Negative in fact, due to the recent car breakdown



I am hoping that someone here can give some advice on the situation and offer some direction. It needs to come from someone other than myself!

personalfinance,Paying off student loans,"Hi,

I'm looking for a little bit of advice with paying off some student loans.  I have approximately $33k in student loans, serviced through FedLoan Servicing.  Each month I make a payment of $445 which is actually spread out over several individual loans.  This includes with approximate totals:

3 subsidized stafford loans (3750, 5750, 5850) at 4.5% interest.
3 unsubsidized stafford loans (5350, 3600, 9000) at 6.8% interest.

I am comfortable with budgeting around $800 a month to paying down the loans in 2016 but I am not sure what the best method is.  As I see it I have 3 choices:

1) Just pay $800 each month in an aggregate payment that will get distributed by the weight of the loans across all 6.

2) Allocate the additional budget to specific loans on a monthly basis and pay down either the biggest unsub'd loan first, the smallest, or all 3.

3) Bank the money until I can just pay off the remaining principal entirely.


I'm pretty sure 1 is the worst idea, but I'm not sure really how the interest/principal allocation works for payments over the minimum with these loans.  My finances outside of this are pretty much a total mess so if this isn't something that can be answered in isolation then I'm happy to provide additional information.

I'm not in bad shape but I have no idea what to do now because I used to be very financially irresponsible.,"Background: Used to be very financially irresponsible for most of my adult life. Went to school full-time and worked part-time jobs, but fucked up and got myself in a lot of credit card debt. Would always pay the minimum on time but carried a high balance (with the stress). 


Now: 29 years old, haven't carried a balance on my credit card for 2 years now, work a full-time job and have no intention of going to school again. Problem is, I've been so long living in the ""negative,"" I have no idea how to live in the ""positive"" (in terms of personal finance). Only debt comes from student loans. 


Income: Take-home pay is $5335 per month, but live in a very high COL area. To give an example, rent for my small, older studio is $2000 and it's although not an amazing deal, still a very good deal for the area. 


Student loans: owe around $40k in federal loans. I pay the minimum every month automatically via checking account and my payments are $450 per month. The interest rates vary from 5-6.8%. 


Assets/savings: I have an old 401k plan from a previous company, my current company doesn't offer a retirement plan at this point in my career. It needs to be switched over by the end of 2015 because they're expiring that plan. If I do nothing they will transfer it over automatically from (old company) 401k retirement plan with fidelity to (new company that bought out old company) with Merrill Lynch on 1/1/16. Has about $8k in it. 


I also have a CD account that my mom opened for me when I was under 18, which has about $20k in it. This money is not something I want to mess around with and my mom looks after it.


Checking account: $15k for right now. I use my checking to pay for everything.


Typical bills I actually receive a monthly bill for: rent ($2k), utilities ($100-$150), car insurance ($150), gym ($70), student loans ($450). Other things I spend money on are gas (usually around $200), food, going out/entertainment, clothes/toiletries, etc. I am single and don't have any real liabilities. 


After reading the reddit wikis, here is my plan, but I have questions and need additional pointers or advice:


1. Do something about my student loans that would help me pay less money overall in the long-run, which leads me to believe I need lower interest rates and/or pay them off faster. Have no idea how to do this, because it seems the interest rates are pretty set. 


2. Set aside $5500 for opening an traditional IRA for 2015. I have already set aside this money. Traditional seems to be the best match for me since my current company doesn't offer a retirement plan (yet).


3. Do something about my expiring 401k plan with old company. Or should I just let the plan transfer? Not really sure either way. 


4. Open a savings account to set up an emergency fund. My goal is $10k. I would start with putting one paycheck per month into this account. This would take me 8 months. 


Other advice or pointers? I really would like to start investing in my future now that I finally have a little cash and am not living under debt stress. Thanks.",finance,1451509515

My name is Hannah, and I will be turning 20 in a couple weeks. I am overwhelmed with my financial responsibility. 


As of now, I pay $300/mo to my parents to live in their home while they still have me on their insurance, phone bills, and car payments. 

My car will be paid in full March 2016.

Family life here is toxic- verbally abusive parents mixed with my depression leads to a toxic and tense environment. Last night I was threatened with being kicked out (again) and I am looking at my options. 

Rent in my part of NC is ~$500-$800/mo.

I am a full time student, employed at a bank, making $11.5 an hour--- about $600 every two weeks. 

I have outstanding credit card debit, $2k in AMEX and $400 in Discover. 

With my upcoming tax return (I file ""0"" is that correct?) and student loan refunds I am looking to what I need to do to move out and be successful. 


1. My vehicle needs maintence, new tires, rotors, coils
2. I'm expecting a solid return (between Sept-Dec from from work I've had &gt;$500 withheld in just fed taxes.)
3. I have moved out before and returned home. I want to move out this time for good and have the security net to have to come back.

personalfinance,"200k settlement, debt free, starting from scratch","I'm asking for general information on the best course of action for a friend of mine who just recently won his labor and industries lawsuit. 

&amp;nbsp;

His settlement is structured to pay him 10k every two weeks for 40 weeks, for a grand total of 200k. He just received his first check this week. He is debt free, aside from a few hundred dollars he needs to pay off to a bail bondsman. He does not have a valid id yet (going to get it tomorrow) so he hasnt set up any bank account to put the money into yet. Hes 27 years old and his only expenses every month are rent which is about 600 a month, a phone bill for him and his fiance which is 1 or 2 hundred a month and then gas and food. He doesnt have any medical bills, his original injury was he compound fractured his tibia but he got a really good surgeon and he says that hes at about 95 percent.

&amp;nbsp;

I do know hes buying a car with some of his money, a truck he wants for avout 1,500. He was unable to work while his case was pending so he has no other source of income coming in except his fiance who brings in a few hundred from unemployment every other week.

&amp;nbsp;

Hes basically starting from scratch with a 200 thousand dollar head start and i was just asking for some advice on the best route to conserve and possibly grow his money situation. Which type of bank account with which bank should he open up? Should he keep all his money in one bank account or seperate it? Should he hire a financial advisor? Should he put some of it into federal bonds for the next 15 years? We live in the Pacific Northwest, Seattle area if that makes any difference.

&amp;nbsp;

Hes a good dude and i just wanna make sure he doesn't fuck up an awesoms opportunity thats been given to him.

December 1, 2015 Changes

Most Official Bankruptcy Forms were replaced on December 1, 2015, with substantially revised, reformatted, and renumbered versions.  The 2015 forms are part of a forms modernization project that was begun by the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules in 2008.  Among other things, the 2015 forms introduce different versions of case opening forms for individual debtors and non-individual debtors.  Links to the instruction booklets for individual debtors, for non-individual debtors, and to a forms number conversion chart can be found below.

The revised forms are easier for debtors to understand and complete, and are designed to work with scheduled enhancements to the federal courts’ case opening and electronic case management system.

Virtually all director’s bankruptcy forms were also replaced by updated and renumbered versions on December 1, 2015.  The new forms are available at Bankruptcy Forms.

I have a stay at home wife and a pre-toddler child. Right now we are staying with my family but plan on moving to a new apartment soon to be closer to my work.

The apartment we are looking at is a two bedroom town home. It's $920/ month with all utilities included except for water($29 flat rate) electricity, and Internet. We will also have to  pay  an additional $30/month for our dog.

My only debt is my federal loans of which I'm paying $300/ month(I could pay less and still be paying more than the minimum). Also, I own a car that I will have to pay insurance on. 

I'm worried that this may be high. We used to live in South Korea and I made about 10k less and paid roughly $300/month so I'm not sure if this is expensive or not.  Also we have over 20k in savings if that helps.

personalfinance,"4 1/2 years ago I was 20k in debt, living off food stamps and couldn't even get a secured CC. Then I found /r/personalfinance and you changed everything. Today, my net worth passed 100k.","Hey /r/personalfinance!

Its a little long down there sooooo lets start with the readers digest version...Also throwaway account because finance talk ;)

**TLDR:** In 4 1/2 years I went from being 20k in debt to [surpassing 100k net worth](http://imgur.com/aRQi970) thanks to /r/personalfinance by:

1. Increasing my income from $0 to $100k per year without increasing lifestyle/expenses
2. Living well below my means 
3. Eliminating Debt
4. Not taking on new debt
5. Saving and Investing in Retirement
6. Being proactive and positive in my career

I cannot believe I actually hit 100k net worth today...its seriously surreal. Words can't describe how grateful I am... both for the financial security I have today and the help /r/personalfinance has given me along the way. Without you guys I have no idea where I would be. I had zero financial knowledge before... like nothing.  

In the past 4 1/2 years the financial advice and expertise you've provided has opened my eyes to a future I couldn't have dreamed of before. I wanted to share my success and offer my story/help to anyone else struggling financially this year. I promise things can and will get better with patience, a little perseverance and of course hard work :)

**My Life Before PF (2011)**

In the interest of keeping things clear and concise... i'll just give you the key bullet points. 

* $20k of Debt (Student Loans - BA in Sociology)
* Unemployed (Lost Social Work Job during the recession) 
* Credit score - Around 350-450? (BoA would not give secured CC to me)
* Broke and on food stamps  
* Only income was selling T-shirts on the street

**Moment of Revelation**

The moment that pushed me to take control of my financial destiny was being denied a secured line of credit and needing to sell my favorite surfboard for rent on the same day. I had never had a credit card before, knew nothing of credit scores and didn't understand why I was denied. I also had no money in the bank and $20 in food stamps for a week of food. 

I realized I needed to understand the financial forces in the world to live the life I dreamed of having. I also realized that those forces were already working against me.  If I didn't learn to make them work for me I realized I would be destined to a life of insecurity, doubt and fear at every unexpected expense. 

I was 27 years old. 

**Creating a Plan**

1. I started reading and learning as much as I could about personal finance, credit, loans, debt, etc.  
2. I discovered /r/personalfinance and immediately posted about my financial situation and asked for advice. 
3. Based on that advice I did the following:
       * Decided to transition careers and started applying for                               internships and entry level positions in new fields. 
       * Requested my free credit report and created a game plan to tackle outstanding debt/negative marks    
       * Organized student loans according to interest rate and created a plan to aggressively highest interest loans and work my way down. 
       * Once I had steady income, resolved to establish an Emergency Fund that would give me a 3-month cushion should I lose my job. 
       * When all of the above was completed...start saving for retirement and building credit

**Step #1**:***Increase Income and Career Potential***

Increasing my income potential and career prospects longterm were of utmost importance to get my finances under control. As such, **I resolved to start from the bottom and work tirelessly develop my skill set.** No matter how much pride/sacrifice it might take... I decided I would find and excel at a new career. I jumped right in and...

* Identified my transferable skills and polished my resume 
* Decided that I wanted to work with startups/companies developing exciting new technology 
* Immediately started applying and interviews. 
* NO JOB WAS ABOVE OR BELOW ME...If it seemed interesting and like I had even a few relevant skills I would apply. 
*  This process was essential in refining my personal pitch and honing in on the positions/areas that interested me the most.
* Not to mention all of the phone interviews/in-person interviews we invaluable training for future job searches 

After a few weeks I was offered an internship and a great company for 20-hours a week at $10 an hour.  All of the other interns were still in college, most couldn't even drink and despite feeling like an OLD ASS MAN at 27... I knew this was a great opportunity and jumped at the offer. 

**Step #2** : ***Work Hard, Move Up***

From the interview my internship it was explicitly stated that no interns would be hired. I decided my new goal would be to change their minds. My performance would convince them to keep me around.  **SO I PROCEEDED TO WORK MY ASS OFF!** By the end of the internship:

* I'd learned more than I could have imagined
* I had two full-time offers on the table from companies I'd applied to over the internship 
* When I told my intern supervisor, he said ""Do not accept another offer... we want you here."" 
* The next day I signed an offer letter at the company I interned with starting at $50k a year. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: 

I've continued working with the same zeal and dedication. As a result, I've been promoted several times and my salary has increased from 50k a year to 100k a year. I believe a strong work ethic can make anything a reality. 

**Step #3** : ***DONT LET MONEY CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE. LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS***

My new salary allowed me to immediately start saving and tackling debt...BUT ONLY BECAUSE I DIDNT SPEND THAT MONEY ELSEWHERE. If I was living on food stamps before... I should be able to keep my expenses low right? 

I continued to live well below my means and put all of my extra money into paying down debt, then saving. **This meant no new cars, no new debt, and no frivolous spending sprees.** I had to keep my eye on the prize even if I wasn't under such intense financial pressure. 

Within 1-year I had:

* Paid off ALL OF MY STUDENT LOANS

* Increased my credit score by over 100 points

* Established an emergency fund of $1000

* Begun utilizing my companies 401k match

* Promoted and given a pay raise   

**Other Essentials**
1. I have found that YOU HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE to increase your income, salary and position. 
 * I initiate salary reviews on a yearly basis with my superiors
 * Jump at the opportunity to take on new responsibilities
 * Being proactive doesn't mean forcing you're way on others
 * I always look for the right and appropriate moments to further my career goals while remaining teachable
 * I NEVER FORGET THAT EVERYONE IS REPLACEABLE and work hard to be an asset to my company 

2. Pay CC off in full every month and don't take on new debt
 * If I want a car... I buy used and wait until I have the cash on hand
 * Same goes for any consumer product 

3. I now MAX OUT ALL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS THAT I CAN
 * 401k
 * ROTH IRA

4. I maintain a liquid emergency fund that will cover EVERYTHING AT MY CURRENT LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE for 6-months  
 * I dont touch it

There is so, so much more I could add... so if you have any questions at all please ask away... I love helping people with this stuff since it the advice I was freely given here literally changed my life. Anyone can do it! I swear! 

Last but not least... THANK YOU ALL AGAIN. If it wasn't for /r/personalfinance I'd still be lost in life!

EDIT: WOW..the skeptics are strong... I didn't immediately respond to comments with questions because i posted this at 2am... then went to bed. I am going to go through today after work and respond to everyones questions one by one.... even if it takes me till 4am.

EDIT #2: I did not win the lotto or inherit any money

EDIT #3: Job progression and salary information ... 

* Assistant Community Manager: $50,000 K
* Community Manager: $66,000 K
* Operations Manager: $80,000 K
* Head of Operations $100,000 K

personalfinance,What are the repercussions for not paying my federal student loans when I don't live in the US anymore?,"Basically I have about $11,000 in federal student loans, federal loans are the only school related loans that I have.

I am never returning to the US so credit score and the like don't matter. I of course plan on paying it off but I need a year or two breathing room and then I will be able to pay it all off in a couple of months because it is just $11,000.",finance,1451552827

investing,Why Amazon is the best investment for 2016 and how it will eventually take over the world.,"I made a lot of money on Amazon last year. I intend to keep holding my shares. Here's why I think that Amazon is the best investment for 2016:

**Major catalysts in online retail** 

Here's the thing, online retail in the US is still a growing market. And Amazon is increasing their share of that growing pie. Per an article in today's [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/technology/in-online-race-its-amazon-and-also-rans.html?_r=0):

&gt;Of every additional $1 Americans spent for items online this year, Amazon captured 51 cents, according to a recent estimate by analysts at Macquarie Research.

And furthermore:

&gt;Over all, Amazon’s share of United States e-commerce sales jumped to 26 percent this year from 22 percent last year, and 16 percent in 2011, according to Macquarie estimates.

As you can see, America is hooked on Amazon. Every single day I go into my apartment building, I see a stack of Amazon packages in the mail room. Not so much for other e-commerce companies like Wayfair or Jet or whatever.

**Prime Expansion**

Amazon Prime is nothing short of genius. It keeps people hooked on Amazon, and keeps them ordering things on Amazon. That is why revenues have increased so much over the past few years - people will buy something from Amazon, even if it costs a few dollars more, because they know they will get it in a timely manner.

Furthermore, with improvements to infrastructure and the advent of Prime Now, Amazon will finally be able to take on grocery stores by offering fast delivery of everything, immediately to a consumer's doorstep. 

Once enough of the world population is hooked on Prime, Amazon will be able to raise prices on Prime. And who will dump Prime? 

**Prime Video**

Amazon's *The Man in the High Castle* demonstrates that it can take on Netflix in the online streaming arena. With time and development of even more original series, Amazon could easily overtake Netflix because they have more money and are better funded. 

**Amazon Web Services**

This is the elephant in the room. My software developer friends and the companies they work for love AWS. They can deploy internal web apps on the fly. In fact, AWS helps power half of the Internet, including Reddit. Microsoft and IBM and all those traditional companies just can't keep up. 

With such name brand recognition and great technology, I see AWS continuing to be a catalyst for increases in Amazon's stock price. 

**Amazon vs. UPS**

Lots has been written about Amazon building out its own delivery network. In fact, some of my packages from Amazon are being delivered via Amazon's internal delivery service, which operates out of their warehouses. 

Logistics is not easy, but it's the key to Amazon's future. I hope that Amazon uses its clout to build out a UPS and Fedex competitor, for it will force those companies to innovate and lower their fees. 

In ten years, once Amazon has completely fleshed out its delivery network, there is no doubt in my mind that it will ultimately decreases costs in the long term. They will have control over the network that makes them the most desirable place to shop online. 

**Conclusion**

There are a lot of naysayers that say that Amazon doesn't have any profits or whatever. Well, Amazon is a stock that breaks all the traditional rules of valuation. They are clearly in a growth phase, building out all the infrastructure that's needed to dominate online retail in North America. Once everything is in place, they can easily raise prices - and people won't have a choice as Amazon has killed off all the big competition. 

Now, I'm not a Wall Street analyst or anything, just an average Joe, but I think that Amazon could easily hit $1,000 a share by the end of 2016. And who knows where it will go in 2017. All I know is that it will keep going up and up and up because Amazon has such great mindshare among online shoppers and the infrastructure they have in place ensures that no other company can come close to the convenience that is Amazon.com.",finance,1451569863

Without further ado, here's part 1 of Chapter 50.

**Terror on Moonbase Alpha** - Chapter 50 Part 1
___
___

""We are similar,"" the voice echoed around her once more.  Kara wasn't sure if it was making an observation, asking a question or stating a fact - but suddenly, now that they were on the subject, she saw an opportunity - not just to save her species but to know more about what had happened to her.

""I was being controlled when it happened - by one of your... helpers.  The one who called out to you for rescue.""

Kara pulled up the memory and shared it with the Overmind, she felt it sigh with pleasure as the scene unfurled before it.  

She was sitting on the bed in the infirmary, feeling shunted into the background of her own mind as the creature controlled her body, and, through her, controlled Jacob to choke the life from that poor DDF psychic.  When the job was done and Jacob came back to his senses, he tried desperately to save her, tried to get help, but the creature was mocking him, incensing him.  It was then that Jacob had launched himself up off of the ground and punched her in the face as hard as he could, yelling in rage and anguish.

She fell. Unceremoniously, Kara felt her body spin and fall and crash to the ground, head-first.

And it was then, there and then, amongst the silence, in the presence of the Overmind that she heard it.

The sickening crack.

Kara wasn't sure how she had missed it before - or maybe she just hadn't wanted to know, hadn't let herself hear it.  

Was that why she had never seemed to care about her body?  Why she had never even bothered to go back and look for it?

She dove deeper into the memory, feeling the impact on the front of her skull as it snapped forward with the weight of her body on top of it, as the vertebrae in her neck splintered and shattered.  Kara felt her body go limp as the nurses rushed in, lifting her back onto the table.  But the creature wasn't done with her yet, it continued to taunt Jacob.

That's when she got mad.  She could feel the swelling in her neck, the throbbing in her jaw and her head... and nothing else.  Unable to speak, unable to move, she knew that she was going to die here, trapped in this body that the creature had broken.  So, when it left, Kara reached out with her tentacles, latched onto the creature's mind and pulled herself free.

""No, look again,"" the Overmind urged, gently.  Now there was an odd, almost maternal, sense of pride in its voice.

Kara re-watched the memory, saw the creature's mind leaving, her mind grasping at it, clawing at it as it pulled away - felt the rage and fury build up inside her as it discarded her body.

And felt herself *pull away* from the creature's mind.

Suddenly it all made sense, a sickening, sorrowful, kind of sense.  

She was Kara, the Kara she knew, the Kara that mattered.

But the real Kara, the young, human woman who had dreamed of outer space, of building a life, a career, a family... had died that day, surrounded by nurses in the Infirmary.

""You broke free,"" the Overmind said.  ""Your mind, your will - the mere copies of these things - tore themselves free and found a way to survive on their own.""  There was no mistaking it now, the Overmind was chuffed to the brim.  ""You didn't just survive, you thrived!""

""And now you're here.  You're home.""

Kara felt the Overmind's presence wash over her - felt the incredible loneliness that it had endured, the eons that had stretched out before their meeting.

""The Earth,"" Kara said, ""You have to leave it alone.""

She felt the Overmind pull away and regard her with uncertainty.

""The Earth, the people on it, they're... they're not to be harmed,"" she repeated.

""Kara, do you know how vast the universe is?  Do you know how hard it is for us to find nourishment?""

""No.  No I don't.  But still, this place, this planet, its people.  It's off limits.  Do you understand?""  Kara spoke with as much confidence as she could muster.  ""If... if you can agree to that, if we can just move on, if we can just... find somewhere else... then I'll stay here, with you.  You'll never have to be alone anymore.""

There was a long pause, a silence.

Kara felt her body tighten, stiffen as her tentacles were pulled and stretched.

""I'm sorry, Kara.  I'm sorry but I can't.  I've been lonely, oh so lonely, for so long... but I've been hungry for far, far longer.""

A vision exploded in her mind then, guns firing, people screaming as the swarm of creatures descended from the sky.

To her great horror, Kara realized that the attack on Earth had already begun.

personalfinance,Wait to buy second house or buy while rates are low?,"My wife and I recently had a baby which is making us consider selling our house and buying one about double the value.  We don't really need the new house until we have another kid or our daughter reaches school-age and we want her in a certain school district.  I'd like to wait until one of those two things happen since we are able to save over $1k/month with our current mortgage but I worry that interest rates are going to rise and by the time we are in need of a new house we won't be able to afford it.  We're also shopping for a new larger car for her, at this point I'd likely write a check for the trade difference of 10-15k but if we are going to buy a house soon I'd want to save that money for part of the down payment.  I guess I don't have a very specific question, just wondering if anyone has any insight into this situation.  Should I wait it out or is the evidence strong enough that it is very likely mortgage rates will rise and diminish our buying power on our second house?",finance,1451577839

investing,"My 10 Stocks to Buy in 2016. Value, Large-cap, Dividend-paying with appropriate DD.","It's a slow day in the office and market, so I thought I would share the stocks I plan to buy January 5th. My plan is to hold these 10 stocks for the next 1-3 years. I will be putting $1000 into each stock. My wife and I already hold the bulk of our retirement funds in diversified index funds. This money will be in a taxable Robinhood account. I will include a brief DD I have done on each stock.

About me: I am a 28 year old amateur investor with 6+ years experience, and a background/interest in statistics. My goal is to maintain steady capital appreciation through a diversified set of 10 individual stocks. I favor under-valued large companies. Hopefully from my write up, you will see some of the financial statistics I look for when I screen companies. I believe 6 out of 10 of my holdings are undervalued at current levels. Please feel free to critique this portfolio and any companies in in it. 

1. Cisco Systems (CSCO)  -  Cisco is the leader in networking and IP security equipment. Look at your office's phones, servers, routers, switches, and web conferencing software, Cisco's name is most likely on that product. I believe they are currently **undervalued**. Forward PE of 11.33, profit margins of 19.33%, high levels of cash to debt (3.35), and an effective management team resulting in a return on equity of 16.42%. Cisco's dividend keeps growing, and it currently yields 3.08%. Their stock price is down ~2% YTD. 

2. Honda Motor Company (HMC) - Honda is known for producing efficient, reliable cars, trucks, and motorcycles. They dominate the US with the Accord, Civic, and CR-V. They will be re-entering the truck market with the Ridgeline in 2017. I have always found Hondas to hit that sweet point with price, reliability, and smart design. I believe Honda is currently **undervalued**. Forward PE of 11.46, price to book value of .97; price to sales of .47. The vehicle business is competitive, however their profit margins (4.86%) and return on equity (8.86%) are above industry standards. They have 8.86B in operating cash flow. Dividend yields 2.2%. Stock is up 8% YTD, but down ~20% over the past 5 years.

3. Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) - Shell is a huge integrated energy company. I believe it is **probably undervalued**. This is based on the fact that I believe oil prices will stabilize in the next coming years. I think we will see a further short-term dip to oil prices around $25-30. I usually would wait for a better entry point, but the dividend yield (8.18%) is too tempting. Shell is trading under book value (.90). It still is inching out a small profit. Perhaps the biggest plus to shell is its large cash reserves (31B) and operating cash flow of (34B). I like shell as a play on oil prices rising. Shell is down 33% YTD.

4. Tesoro (TSO) - Tesoro is my hedge against oil prices staying where they are/going lower. Tesoro is a refining company that I found through some /r/investing posts (thanks!). Refiners will continue to do well with lower oil prices, and statistically-wise, they are the best refiner in the US. I believe they are **fairly-priced**. They have a forward PE of 11.53 and trade for a little over 2x's book value. Profits have grown 91% yoy. Management has been highly effective with their cash (return on equity 25.75%). They have more debt than cash on hand, but still operate with an operating cash flow of 2.16B. Dividend yield 1.94%. They are up 46% YTD

5. Travelers Companies (TRV) -Travelers is an insurance company. I've personally used them, and found their prices and customer service to be amazing. I wanted exposure to the insurance industry due to rising interest rates. This will allow insurance companies to profit more on the insurance premiums they collect.  Travelers seemed the most **under-valued** in the insurance industry. They have a forward PE of 11.57, price to book of 1.45. Profit margins of 13.62%. Management has been effective with capital resulting in a return on equity of 14.63%. Dividend yield of 2.17%. Travelers is up 6.86% YTD.

6. Western Digital Corp (WDC) - The leader in storage devices. This company recently made a splash by acquiring Sandisk to gain broader exposure to the flash storage market. Their main rival is Seagate. Storage needs will only increase as more and more people and companies store and send data intensive files. Our world is only becoming more and more reliant on video-chatting, picture-sharing. New devices like smartphones, automated cars, and oculus will only continue consuming data. That data will need to be stored somewhere. The storage industry is becoming increasingly more consolidated. I really believe the industry is at the start of a huge transition. I believe WDC is **undervalued**. They have a forward PE of 8.16, price to sales of 1.01, PB of 1.51. Profit margin of 9.47%, Return on Equity of 14.48%. Their cash exceeds debt with a ratio of 2.68. Dividend yields 3.32%. WDC is down 45% YTD. 

7. Walmart (WMT) - The retailing giant is down 28.55% YTD largely in result to Walmart deciding to raise the pay of their minimum wage workers. This has affected quarterly YoY earnings growth (-11%). Despite the investment in their workers, I believe Walmart to be **undervalued**. They have a forward PE of 14.69, price to sales of .41, price to book 2.49 (lowest in industry). Profit margins are at 3.12%. Management has always been effective with a return on equity of 18.62%. Dividend yields 3.24%. They have tons of cash flow with an operating cash flow of 28.10B. Walmart benefits from low oil prices. They have a decent online shopping system. I expect their investment in workers to start attracting new customers. 

8. Visa (V) - Visa is a cash cow that takes 2.5% every time you swipe a credit card. They benefit tremendously from the rise of online shopping. Most people I know rarely carry cash. If you travel to under-developed countries, you will see the growth in more and more businesses accepting Visa. People have caught on to this amazing business model, and thus Visa is **over-valued**. Their forward PE of 23 is just slightly above the S*P 500's PE of 21. It trades at 6x's book value (ouch). For this high valuation, you get profit margins of 45.59%, and return on equity of 22.11%. The company has 0 debt, and pays a tiny dividend of .72%. Visa is up 19% YTD. I hate buying over-valued companies, but they are an excellent company, and I do not see them making a significant pull-back anytime soon. 

9. Nike (NKE) - Nike is the world-wide leader in athletic shoes and sports apparel. Similar to Visa they are very **over-valued**, but I want in. They have a forward PE of 25. Price to book of 8. Profit margins of 11.55%. They have stellar management with a return on equity of 28.84%. Their apparel is starting to catch on in under-developed markets, and they boast quarterly YoY growth of 20%. They pay a small dividend of .97%. More cash than debt with a ratio of 3. I'm honestly not sure if Nike is worth the high price. They are up 30% YTD. 

10. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) - Johnson&amp;Johnson is your friendly maker of Tylenol, Band-Aid, Benadryl, Neutrogena, and countless other consumer staples. I chose JNJ as protection in case the market has a broad decline in 2016/2017. Most likely they are **fairly-valued**. JNJ has a forward PE of 16. They have high profit margins (20%) and return on equity (19.87%). They have more cash than debt (2.51). They trade 4x's book value. Their dividend is a rock solid 2.92%. JNJ is down 1.4% YTD. 

My biggest concern right now is that I do not have any price targets set, so I'm not sure at what price I would sell my stocks. This is probably something I should research more into before my purchases. I appreciate any feedback. Hopefully this write-up will help you in becoming a better investor.",finance,1451579618

personalfinance,"Wife and I reviewing financial status, looking for input/advice. We feel financially secure, but don't believe we're making the best use of our money.","As the title says, my wife and I are looking for areas to improve our financial planning over the coming years.  Here's roughly where we are with assets, debts, and goals.  Most numbers are rounded for simplicity

We're both in our lower 30's, married (to one another :), one child (2 years old, planning for a second child soon).  Combined annual income is in the $175,000 range, stable jobs.  We live in the midwest so cost of living is fairly cheap.  We are very fortunate to have essentially acquired a large amount of stock in several companies, specifically US Bank (USB), Duke Energy (DUK) and Spectra Energy (SE).

**Goals:**
 
* Pay off our current vehicle ($5,800) in the next two years
* Pay off current home ($159,000) by 2027
* Provide a college education for our son in 16 years.  Currently saved $24,500 in 529 plan
* Plan to provide a college education for hopefully a second child in ~19-21 years
* Set us up for a possible early retirement, maybe somewhere around 2043-2045
* Allocate our liquid funds in the best way to allow for an emergency fund, but not be sitting on cash when it could be invested elsewhere

**Assets / Portfolios**
*Note*: First time using hellomoney.co, I lumped several retirement accounts under VFIFX as I don't know some of the funds we have off-hand.  All money in VFIFX is under that ticker or a comparable, target retirment 2050.  This holds both our current 401K's and Roth IRA's investments

* Rough approximation of combined portfolio: https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/db114a-pfwinkle-portfolio : $878,764.84
* Savings: $42,000
* Checking: $40,500
* Vehicles: 1 fully owned, worth ~$7000
* Bright Start 529 for our son: $24,500


**Debts/Expenses**

* Vehicles: $5800.  Paying off 1 newer vehicle with a monthly payment of $323 @ 1.00%.  Will be paid off in the next 1.5 years roughly
* House: $159,000 @ 3.13% left on our 30 year loan due in 2042.  Mortgage is around $1322/mo, we pay an additional $534 against the principal every month.  Currently on track to pay off in July, 2027 (paying as if it was a 15 year loan)
* Credit Cards: Pay off in full each month.  All expenses besides our mortgage are put on our Chase Freedom card to earn points, typical monthly bill is $3,900
* Daycare for son: ~$1200/month, roughly $14,400/year.  He will be in daycare for another ~2-3 years then starting public school, with hopefully a second child starting daycare in 1-2 years.


**Questions, Guidance, Thoughts, Considerations**

*I apologize if this gets more into a /r/portfolios discussion, I can repost there if it makes more sense*

* US Bank (USB) makes up the majority of our combined accounts, and that scares me quite a bit.  I'd like to diversify our entire portfolio, but primarily break up the USB.  We would like to have low-moderate risk funds in our portfolio for the majority, with a smaller percentage being available for higher risk investments.
* We each fund our 401K's to 100% company match (wife does more).  Both have Roth IRA's, but we haven't been maxing out those investments.  I would expect that to be one take away from this thread?
* We overpay against our principal on our home currently.  With our interest rate at 3.13%, would it make better sense to invest this money elsewhere to get a better rate of return, and just pay the mortgage as normal?
* I feel like we have way too much money sitting in 0-yield accounts (checking, current savings is almost 0%).  Is there a better recommendation on where to reallocate this money?  What banks or savings accounts would be best for our money to grow?


I tried to paint as clear a picture as I could of our financial situation, and would love any input you have.  Please let me know if there is anything I can clarify!  What modifications would you make if you were us?  How might we best diversify our current portfolios?",finance,1451580772

personalfinance,Receiving $5k in will and need help deciding which debt to pay or to stash some away as savings.,"In the next year I will be receiving $5k from the sale of a family estate. I had a couple debts, zero savings, zero job, and live at home. Go me, right?

* $27,000 in federal student loans - Currently throwing about 10-15 bucks per month at them

* $4,724 owed to university I graduated from last year - Parents helped themselves to my financial aid, I was forced to withdraw early from a program, and this amount is what I owe for ~~having a shitty family~~ breaking contract and various financial aid. This is what I'm most concerned about because they demand full payment and despite making a bit of a contribution each month, they still threaten collections if not paid in full immediately. My transcripts are therefore withheld. 

* I have no savings and 38 cents to my name right now. 

* I live at home and for the last year have been the caretaker of an ailing family member who cannot be left alone and is quite dependent. I hate it because I don't even have a bed or bedroom or place to store my things. 

My question is what would be the most responsible place to throw that $5k? I want to say the university to get them off my back and have access to my records.

personalfinance,Grad school reimbursed by employer in 2 years. Should I take out loans or use savings to pay tuition now? How should I repay loans?,"I'm in a one year, full-time graduate program. I graduate in May. In September I will start work at my previous employer.  My employer will pay for my tuition in two lump sums over the next two years. I've already taken out some loans, but want to know if I should take out more or pay with my savings.  

Total tuition will be around $92k. I pay for living expenses from savings.  Besides my 401k, I have $66k invested in index funds and $50k in cash savings (recently received my signing bonus). I have taken out $21k in Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Federal Loans (5.84% interest), $12k in Federal Perkins Loans (5% interest), and $29k in loans from my family (0% interest). 

That leaves $30k left of tuition that I need to pay. I can take out an additional $21k in Fed Unsubsidized Loans and $4k in Perkins.  

How should I repay my loans?  Minimum monthly payments or pay off as much as I can as quickly as possible?  Which loans do I prioritize first? I am reimbursed by my employer in two lump sums (after one year and after two years). Do I allocate all those payments to my loans?

As a bonus question, what should I do about 401k contributions and IRA contributions? While my income is low this year (2015) should I contribute extra to certain ones, like Roth vs traditional? I don't know all the rules.",finance,1451584705
economy,Pet Theory: America has a recession during the first term of any new president.,"So, I think this is a pet theory that can hold some water.  Obama, Bush Jr., and Clinton all had recessions in their first term.  

The one that Clinton had actually started under Bush Sr.'s first term, but it came late in his first term, right after the first Gulf War.  

Reagan had a recession in his first term as did Carter.  Reagan's recession was definitely planned by Federal Reserve chairman Volkner, in order to eventually lower inflation.  

The 70's are where the theory starts to get iffy, due to recessions caused by OPEC.  

Anyway, I think it's in a president's best interest to have a recession early in their first term.  It allows Wall Street to wipe their bad investments off the table, and it gives time for the Fed to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy back to normal before the next election.

investing,3 Easy Ways to Start Saving for Retirement (for Teenagers and Millennials),"I have no clue what retirement is like. I don’t even like to think about what retirement means.

I’m 20, I’m young, and for me retirement is way off somewhere in the distant future.

A recent report from the Insured Retirement Institute (IRI) and the Center for Generational Kinetics shed some light on the savings habits of individuals aged 20-37. According to the study, 68% of millennials are actively saving for their retirement.

That is awesome. That means that even though thinking about retirement is weird, people are doing it.

In this post I will outline what tools are available for you to start saving for retirement. I will stay away from giving investment advice, rather I will focus on the different ways retirement accounts can save you money and protect your future.

**1. Open a Roth IRA**

*DEFINITION OF ROTH IRA*
&gt;An individual retirement plan that bears many similarities to the traditional IRA, but contributions are not tax deductible and qualified distributions are tax free. Similar to other retirement plan &gt;accounts, non-qualified distributions from a Roth IRA may be subject to a penalty upon withdrawal.

A Roth Independent Retirement Account (IRA) is a millennials most effective tool to save for retirement. A Roth IRA is a special type of investment account. You can take the money you put into a Roth IRA and invest in Nike, Apple, Google, a mutual fund, index fund, exchange traded fund, or even bonds. You can do whatever you want with this money once it is in this account.

What makes a Roth ideal for retirement savings is the fact that you contribute after tax dollars. This means that when you withdraw earnings at age 59 1/2 or older you will not be taxed again. There is flexibility though if you want to withdraw money before your 60th birthday, you can always remove the initial capital you invested without penalty, just not the earnings accrued from that money.

A Roth allows you to contribute a maximum of $5500 a year to it, with no aggregate cap. (There is no maximum cap for how much money can be in the account).

Let’s look at an example.

Imagine you make a single $5500 contribution at age 20. 40 years go by and you did not make any other contributions to that account, but you did re-invest your dividends. How much would that $5500 be worth in 40 years? Imagine you return a measly 4% on your capital each year. How much would that add up to in 40 years?

**$26,405.61**

What if you could afford to contribute $5500 each year from 20 to 60 years old. How much would that money be worth when you are 60, let’s again assume a small return of 4% annually?

**$569,951.56**

And, let’s say we manage to do well in the market and hit a 7% return on our investment each year. What would that put us at?

**$1,257,212.15**

Of course, these same returns could be made in a traditional investment account, but remember the benefits of the Roth IRA. In our last example we invested $220,000 dollars from age 20 to age 60. Of that, our investments made a little over 1 million dollars. In a traditional investment account that income would be taxed at between 15% and 20%. With the Roth IRA that income is not taxed.

That is great, a Roth IRA shields you from being taxed on capital gains when you are older. The benefit there seems pretty self-explanatory. But what if you can’t afford to invest $5500?

**2. Open a myRA**

&gt;Unlike other Roth IRAs, myRA has features designed to make it a starter retirement savings account. myRA is invested in a single United States Treasury retirement savings bond, which will &gt;not lose money and is backed by the United States Treasury. Money that you put in your myRA will earn interest until your account reaches $15,000 or 30 years from the day you first fund the &gt;account (whichever comes first). The account balance will then be transferred to a private-sector Roth IRA, where you can continue to invest your savings and make additional contributions. &gt;You can also transfer or roll over your myRA to a private-sector Roth IRA of your choice at any time.

If you are not capable of investing $5500 at a time in a Roth IRA then the myRA is for you.

The myRA is a federally backed retirement savings account. The myRA is intended for low-income individuals who cannot afford to save large chunks of money at once.

The myRA has the exact same tax benefits of the Roth IRA. You contribute after tax income and are able to remove that money after age 59 1/2 or older without being taxed.

The key differences between the Roth IRA and the myRA are:

* Maximum total contribution of $15,000
* 30 year max lifespan of the account
* You do not choose where the money is invested

Contributions are invested in the United States Treasury Bond. The myRA website explains how that works:

&gt;The money you put in your myRA account is invested in a United States Treasury savings bond, that safely earns interest at the same variable rate as investments in the Government &gt;Securities Fund for federal employees. The return for these investments was 2.31% in 2014 and 3.19% over the ten-year period ending December 2014. Past performance is not a guarantee &gt;of or prediction of current or future performance.

After saving money in your myRA you can roll it over to a Roth IRA and continue saving.

**3. Use your 401k**

&gt;A qualified plan established by employers to which eligible employees may make salary deferral (salary reduction) contributions on a post-tax and/or pretax basis. Employers offering a 401(k) &gt;plan may make matching or non-elective contributions to the plan on behalf of eligible employees and may also add a profit-sharing feature to the plan. Earnings accrue on a tax-deferred basis.

If you have just completed college and landed your first salaried position you should be investing in your company’s 401k plan.

With a 401k your investment options may be limited, and there are most likely restrictions on when and how you can withdraw assets without penalties. But, 401k plans generally are matched by employers.

Matching is when your employer contributes money to your retirement account. The most common practice is for employers to match 100% of the first 6% you contribute.

For example, if you make $50,000 a year and contribute $3,000 (6%) to your 401k your employer would contribute another $3,000 as a match. You just made $3,000 by saving for your retirement. Independent retirement accounts cannot provide you this benefit, only 401k’s and other employer related retirement accounts.

**Conclusion**

Saving money for the distant future is not all that sexy.

Just know that by starting young you are setting yourself up for success. No matter what investment vehicle you choose your future self will thank you.",finance,1451586366

personalfinance,Question About Medicaid and Income changes,"I want to preface this with this: I'm not trying to scam the federal government. I'm simply confused on what to do.

I recently got approved for Medicaid, I've been unemployed for a few months now, and even when I had a job, it was a student position (Making less than 5K per year). 

When I applied for Medicaid I was unemployed, I just offered my first ""real job"" making roughly $20.00 an hour, but my benefit card just came in the mail earlier this week. The documents say that I need to report any changes in income that may occur, but even with this new job (which I'm more than grateful for), I still don't think I'll be able to afford actual healthcare benefits on my own due to having to pay Student Loans, Bills, Car payment, Insurance, Rent, etc...what do you guys think I should do? Should i report with my new income and just hope that they approve me again for this year (2016), or will it just affect my approval for next year (2017)?",finance,1451588228
personalfinance,IRA grad school question,"Hi /r/personalfinance...got a question on a pretty unique situation, wasn't sure where else to look.
I am currently employed making a decent salary (65k with 15k bonus in 2015, 75k base in 2016) in a job I am quickly becoming sick of.  As of this month, I got an offer for almost a full-tuition scholarship from a great grad school, and I've decided to attend starting in the fall of 2016.

Since I will be a full-time student, for 2017, I do not expect to have much income (probably ~5k over the summer, unlikely to be much higher).  I was planning on contributing the maximum $5.5k to a traditional IRA this year, deducting that amount from my 2015 taxes, and converting to a Roth IRA in 2017, thereby paying a lower federal tax rate on the contribution, as I will have a much lower income in 2017.  However, I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that, since my current employer started a 401k program at the end (November) of this year, and I've already put ~1k into that.  Does anyone know if you can still contribute to a traditional IRA at my salary level after participating in an employer-sponsored 401k for part of the year?

If it matters, I have ~9.5k in an old 401k from a previous employer that I am also thinking about converting to a Roth in 2017.

Any advice on this is greatly appreciated!",finance,1451588529
personalfinance,Focus on paying off monthly accrued interest on federal student loans or focus solely on paying off private student loans?,"I recently got accepted for Pay as You Earn for my federal student loans, which currently total $51,913.  My minimum monthly payments have lowered from $511 to $69.  Interest accrues at roughly $200 a month, so my balance will be increasing $131 per month if I pay the minimum.  The $69 is based on my $26,000 salary. Fortunately, my salary has increased to $35,000 since then, and I won't have to recertify with my higher salary until Jan 2017.

I also have private student loans:
$4452 @ 8.75% , currently paying at least $400/mo
$8084 @ 8.25% , min mo. payment $121
$3408 @ 7.5% , min mo. payment $50
$3736 @ 7.25% , min mo. payment $76
(Note: I haven't had to pay anything on my federal loans yet, and won't until Feb.)

I'm having difficulty calculating which would make more sense: 
(1) pay the minimum on my federal loans and aggressively pay down my higher interest rate private loans, or
(2) pay off the accrued interest each month on my private loans and therefore pay $130 less per month on my private loans.

I am eligible for PSLF, which would clear my fed. loans after 10 years or 120 payments, but I'm not sure if I'll stay in this line of work for that long.
I don't want to see my federal loan balance skyrocket over the next 10-20 years, but I also want to wipe away my private loans ASAP.  The uncertainty whether I'll be able to use PSLF doesn't help the situation.  For right now, I'll assume the worst and say my federal loans won't be forgiven for 20 years, which is how long it takes for loans to be forgiven under PAYE.

So what should I do, pay the minimum on my federal loans or the interest that accrues each month to keep the balance at bay?  Will that $130 per month be better utilized keeping my fed loan balance from increasing or paying down my private loans more quickly?

Other info: I am 24, currently saving 10% of each paycheck for my emergency fund, which is at $2500 so far.  I also contribute 10% to my company's 403b (however, they don't match so I'll soon be rolling over to a Roth IRA).  I plan to continue contributing 10% of my after-tax income to that.

personalfinance,Student loan Avalanche Method Question: Is changing SL repayment from 10 year track to lower income based worth it if...?,"Long time lurker first time posting, Thanks to this sub I have no credit card debt and $4k in emergency savings!!! My questions is If I qualify for a lower monthly payment plan should I take the adjustment so that I can put the money I would have put into minimum payments into the loan with the highest interest rate? I will be contributing an extra $500-800 a month to the loan with the highest interest rate each month anyways. My question is whether or not it would be advantageous to lower my monthly payments and put a couple hundred more into the loan with the highest interest or not? I only plan on working my current job for 1 year (2016) while I apply to graduate school if that makes a difference. I intend on putting $1k a month towards debt, I take home 2k a month.

personalfinance,36yof considering 2nd bankruptcy...,"I'll start off by saying I am FULLY aware I'm terrible with money. Extremely undisciplined, tend to 'treat' myself too often, even if it's just $20. I'm in therapy for this, among other things. So if you feel it's necessary to be condescending, trust me I have a Catholic, Mexican grandmother and I've heard it all! 10 years ago, I filed bankruptcy. I'd found myself in significant medical debt, payday loan quicksand,etc. I filed, discharged and promptly bought a used car. I paid on the car for 5 years (6 year loan), but had just moved in w/ a bf who lost his job a week after we moved into a rental which was $400 more than what I was paying alone in my apartment w/ my then 9 yr old son. The car was repossessed. I'd paid 20k by then. It's now 10 years later and I find myself in the following situation: New job (5 months) making $17.64/hr. (gross is around 1300, net 1100). Rent+water, sewer, garbage is $872.69. Cable/internet is $128 (if I change it or disconnect my contract starts over or I pay $200 disconnect fee) gas (for hot water not a car) is $45/mo. Electricity:$125 every two months. I receive $500/mo in child support which will end in June 2016 (he's now 18). I do not own a car anymore, but have had  use of one for the last 6 months or so, so gas was about $50/month (I work 2 miles from my house) I am on public transportation now. My cell is $150/mo and I receive $50/mo from one of the people on my plan. My previous car loan caught up to me last month. They are garnishing my wages every 2 weeks $352.68. The balance now on that car loan is $26k. I have an outstanding debt to a landlord for breaking a lease for about $5200. I have an old electricity bill for about $500, and medical bills to the tune of about $1200. I have unpaid tickets that are $3600 or so. We spend about $300/mo for food. The car loan company said if I put a down payment of 25% of 3 mos worth of my income, they could reduce the interest rate to 0-5%. I do not have $2100+. I cannot borrow it. I don't have anything to sell, don't own a car no stocks, bonds, no retirement, etc. I have no credit cards, no credit card debt. My credit score is 600 (which I know ain't shit, but it's the highest it's been in years). But I feel my back against the wall again. They have taken 2100 so far and I'm getting behind in bills. Already paying Jan rent late, and behind on the water/sewer/garbage payment which was due in Dec. I have 3 years of unfiled taxes as well. From what I can tell, I have to pay someone to file those? $300 per year is what I was told. I am reaching out to see if anyone has thoughts on what I could do differently to save myself from bankruptcy, or if it's really the best option at this point? I'm disappointed, of course....but also committed to changing my ways, and interested in not taking 'the easy way out', even though my experience w/ bankruptcy has never been easy. I am hopeful that I can have a different life in my 40's and know I need to start now.",finance,1451594988

personalfinance,What to do with an inheritance?,"Hello, people who know what to do with money!  

My mother was killed roughly 8 months ago, and I have received an unexpected windfall, and I'm not sure what to do with what I have remaining.   I received roughly $25000 from her pension/retirement accounts, most of which I used to buy a car (which I paid a down payment of $10,000 and financed $13000 at ~7.8% or so)  I used the majority of the other $25000 to pay down credit card debts.  I'm expecting to receive another $25-$30k from selling her house after probate closes. 

My debts are as follows: 
$13000 (roughly) car debt @7.8%
Assortment of student loans totalling around $55k, with individual loans ranging from ~$6k - ~$20k, with rates between 4 and 8 percent.
Credit card debt totalling ~$7k with interest rates ranging from 16% - 24%

I have around $7k sitting in my checking as a result of further windfalls from this, but no savings/retirement/any other accounts. 

At this juncture, I really don't know what I should be doing with any of this money.  I realize the new car was a very large expense and additional debt that I didn't really need, but I had a strong need for a reliable vehicle, and I'm intending it to last me at least a decade, hopefully longer.  

What I would like to know is if I should use any further windfalls to pay off debt, and if so, how to determine which debts to pay off first (I like the waterfall approach, but I can't tell if it's the best approach for me), if I should save any money and if so, how much, if I should invest any of it, and if so how, and so on. I've really not ever had any money to spare, and I'd really like to not do anything too stupid with it. 

Oh, and as for employment, I am currently very underemployed. One of the reasons I had/have so much credit card debt is that my job doesn't pay me enough to make ends meet, and I was having to put some things on credit cards without being able to pay it off (which is bad, I know, but not being able to eat is worse).  It wasn't a whole lot, only a few hundred each month, but combined with having to charge car repairs and things like that, it added up.  I am hoping to find a better paying job, but I can't rely on what doesn't exist yet, yknow?

So, someone please help me figure out how to not be stupid with this money?",finance,1451595703
personalfinance,Investment Priorities w/ California Taxes and Student Loans,"Hi, 

This is my first post but I'm a long time lurker (and occasional commenter.)  I'm trying to determine the appropriate investment priorities for my personal situation.  I've kept our expenses reasonably low and should accumulate about 60k to invest over the next year.

According to my budgeting projections, we will make an estimated 172k which puts us squarely in the 28% bracket federally and the 9.3% bracket in CA.

Now we have plenty of student loans most below 7% interest and an average of 6.4%.  The total balance is approximately $230k.  

Given that I don't plan to retire in CA, I'd estimate my taxes to be much lower in retirement than currently as a wild guess probably 12-17%.  This means that putting money in a 401k has a high return on taxes alone of over 10%.

Should I focus on maxing out my 401k before debt repayment even though my loans are higher than the 5% recommended by this sub?

If so, the plan is to do the following.

Minimum payments on student loans $19000 (approximate IBR).

401k w/ Match $12000

Traditional IRA $11000

Additional 401k $18000

Ohh also before anyone says anything.  We have 10k in cash and 22k in a Roth IRA for emergencies which is enough for 6 months. Also, my wife and I both have jobs which reduces our risk a bit so it's more like 9 months.",finance,1451599675
